pmcWe welcome the interest of Bakels et al. regarding our short correspondence that highlighted over-representation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Huntington disease (HD) brains [1, 8]. ALS is an incurable and devastating neurodegenerative disease. Its genetic etiology overlaps with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but many patients lack an obvious mechanism. Dewan et al. found that pathogenic HTT gene expansions (PHGE) were consistently more frequent in FTD/ALS across two cohorts (~0.1% of FTD/ALS patients), suggesting another genetic cause of FTD/ALS and a potential therapeutic target [4]. Through an alternative, but complementary, perspective to Dewan et al., we analyzed two HD cohorts and found that ALS is over-represented in HD brains and that the recurring association between PHGE and ALS warrants further exploration [8]. Our findings have important implications for ALS pathogenesis and the valuable commentary by Bakels et al. does not diminish our conclusion. We take this opportunity to examine the reality of replicating a large-scale brain bank study involving rare diseases and discuss the discernable pathologic changes between ALS and HD by light microscopy that made this study possible.

The foremost hurdle of reproducibility that is overlooked by Bakels et al. is not neuropathologically diagnosing HD or ALS, but rather banking sufficient HD brains to capture the low frequency of ALS in HD. HD is rare. A recent US Medicare/Medicaid study estimated the prevalence between 13.1 and 15.2 per 100,000 [5]. ALS is also rare (prevalence: 5.2 per 100,000) [10]. Therefore, without an organized multi-institutional effort to recruit HD brain donors, one requires enrollment over decades to assemble the hundreds of HD brains necessary to find sufficient comorbid cases. Through prolonged case accrual over one of the author’s working lifetime studying HD neuropathology and developing the grading system that is now standard in HD neuropathologic practice (JPV), this analysis was attainable (n = 751) [15]. We value rigor in brain banking protocols (see Ref. [14] for comprehensive protocols at the New York Brain Bank (NYBB)/supplementary methods) and utilized a standardized blocking system that incorporated at least 14 blocks (discovery, validation, ET cohorts). This blocking system applies the Brodmann map and is designed to enable consistent comparisons of commonly affected, selectively vulnerable, brain regions across diverse neurologic conditions, such as HD, ALS and essential tremor (ET). Diagnoses were rendered using LH&amp;E-stained sections alongside clinical information where available. Since these cohorts spanned 4 decades, we used the histopathologic features of ALS outlined by Brownell et al. in 1970 as the diagnostic changes seen in ALS and that of HD by Vonsattel et al. in 1985 [3, 15].

Of 132 brains at the NYBB with an intake diagnosis of HD, two (1.5%) had ALS with aberrant TDP-43 labeling and HTT inclusions. To validate this over-representation of ALS in HD, we reviewed one of the authors’ (JPV) personal records as a non-NYBB cohort and found four HD brains with ALS (n = 619). The combined frequency of ALS in HD was 0.8%—approximately 150 times more frequent than the US prevalence of ALS [8].

We next compared the frequency of ALS in HD from the discovery group with another disease group at the NYBB that used the same banking protocol. We chose a cohort with an intake diagnosis of ET since this was the best cohort of moderate size (n = 235) available. Other conditions suggested by Bakels et al. had associations with ALS; a clinical intake diagnosis of Alzheimer disease may introduce FTLD/ALS and similarly Parkinson disease may insert MAPT-associated PD that associates with ALS. While the median (± IQR) ages of death were older in ET than ALS in our cohorts (90.0 ± 8.0 versus 57.5 ± 4.8 years, P &lt; 0.01, Mann–Whitney test), the median age-of-onset of action tremor in ET approximated the median age-of-death of HD/ALS individuals (50.0 ± 41.5 years, P = 0.44, Mann–Whitney test). Furthermore, many ET donors received long-term antemortem follow-up, including a subset commencing at 55 years of age, making the concern of survival bias less relevant.

Although we agree with Bakels et al. that ALS and HD have overlapping brain regions with disease involvement, there are striking dissimilarities in the pathologic findings that should relieve any diagnostic confusion. The gradient of neostriatal degeneration in HD contrasts with the neostriatal changes found in sporadic FTLD/ALS. For example, the consistent degeneration of the tail of the caudate nucleus observed in grades 1–4 of HD is not a histopathologic hallmark of ALS [15]. Their reference to volumetric reductions by neuroimaging of the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens in ALS is interesting [2], but the microscopic neostriatal degenerative changes are more limited in ALS than HD and the nucleus accumbens is relatively spared of degenerative changes than the rest of the neostriatum in HD [15]. Likewise, their specified article by Rüb et al. which describes neuronal loss in the HD brainstem (n = 8) utilized “unconventionally thick serial brain tissue sections” (100 μm) to allow for “the recognition of subtle pathological changes” [12]. The work does not directly compare to ALS brains, nor does it definitively report the motor nuclei that are usually severely affected in ALS (i.e. hypoglossal nuclei, nuclei ambigui, motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve). These nuclei are documented, however, by Brownell et al. [3]. Admittedly, Rüb et al. described two cases with neuronal loss in the motor nucleus of the facial nerve, a vulnerable nucleus in ALS; could this alone be mistaken for ALS?

Additional neurodegenerative diseases may occur in HD and it is, therefore, expected that multiple proteinopathies coexist in a subset [7, 9]. The referenced work by St-Amour et al. is important but describes various proteinopathies in HD putamina through biochemical methods rather than conventional immunohistochemistry that is routinely employed in diagnostic laboratories across brain regions [13]. Regardless, the diagnosis of ALS or HD was primarily rendered through microscopic examination of LH&amp;E stains thus increasing the diagnostic threshold.

Our approach has biases, as do many other brain bank studies [6, 11]. Whichever angle one looks at, by genetic analysis of ALS tissues or pathologic examination of HD brains, data support that PHGE is associated with ALS.
