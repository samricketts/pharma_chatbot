A new study found methylphenidate to be effective in treating apathy in individuals with Alzheimer disease. At a time when the recent aducanumab approval is focusing attention on the promise of disease-modifying therapies, the new findings highlight the importance of developing better symptomatic treatment options for individuals with psychiatric disorders of Alzheimer disease.


pmcIndividuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) can exhibit psychosis, agitation, irritability, apathy, depression, anxiety, wandering, sleep disorders and many other neuropsychiatric syndromes; however, to date, no drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of these aspects of AD. The agents that are most commonly used to treat agitation and psychosis are antipsychotics that have a boxed warning concerning their use in dementia, noting an approximately twofold treatment-associated increase in mortality for this patient population. When pharmacological therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders in AD is required, clinicians have no choice but to use drugs that have uncertain efficacy, are unapproved for the condition, have a notable safety warning, and have been shown to exacerbate cognitive dysfunction1. Despite the clear need for new therapies for the neuropsychiatric aspects of AD, just 9 of the 126 drugs in the current AD clinical trial pipeline are being assessed for this purpose2. In a new study published in JAMA Neurology, Mintzer et al.3 found methylphenidate to be effective for the treatment of apathy in AD, representing an important step towards better treatment options for patients with AD and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with AD and contributes substantially to patient disability and caregiver distress. Apathy can be observed during the preclinical and prodromal phases of AD and increases in severity and prevalence as the disease progresses to mild and moderate stages of dementia. In autopsy and imaging studies, apathy in AD and other neurodegenerative and vascular disorders has consistently been associated with pathology of the medial frontal and anterior cingulate regions of the brain4. Interruption of frontal–subcortical networks associated with goal-directed behaviours is posited to mediate the emergence of apathy in AD. A consensus definition of apathy5, published this year, is expected to facilitate clinical research and trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The definition calls attention to three key dimensions of apathy: diminished initiative (less spontaneous or active than usual), decreased interest (less enthusiastic about usual activities), and reduced emotional expressiveness and/or responsiveness (less affectionate, concerned, empathic).

The new study by Mintzer et al.3 builds on the findings of the apathy in dementia methylphenidate trial (ADMET)6. ADMET did not meet its primary outcome, but overall the results suggested that methylphenidate reduced apathy. The new study — ADMET 2 — included 200 participants with mild-to-moderate AD and at least moderately severe apathy who were assigned randomly to received either methylphenidate (titrated to 10 mg twice per day) or placebo3. The study had two alternative primary outcomes: a significant drug–placebo difference in the change from baseline on the apathy scale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) or a significant drug–placebo difference in the odds of an improved rating on the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC). Meeting either outcome after 6 months of treatment was pre-specified to be indicative of a positive trial supportive of treatment efficacy. Methylphenidate reduces the reuptake of dopamine and noradrenaline by blocking the dopamine and noradrenaline transporters, which results in increased dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity in the prefrontal cortex and higher dopamine levels in the striatum.

“clinicians have no choice but to use drugs that have uncertain efficacy”

ADMET 2 met the pre-specified outcome of a significant drug–placebo difference on the NPI apathy scale, with a mean change of −4.5 points (standard deviation (s.d.) 4.1) from baseline in the active treatment group and −3.1 points (s.d. 3.6) in the placebo group (P = 0.002)3. The researchers used Kaplan–Meier curves to estimate the rate at which participants achieved an NPI apathy score of 0 and reported a hazard ratio of 1.57 (P = 0.07) over the 6-month follow-up period. The hazard ratio for the first 100 days of the trial was 2.16 (odds P = 0.01), which suggests that there might have been some accommodation over time to the effect of methylphenidate or decrease in apathy in the placebo group. The odds ratio for a difference in mean change on ADCS-CGIC from baseline to month 6 (180 days) was 1.43 (P = 0.048), favouring methylphenidate over placebo. The number of participants with a body weight reduction of more than 7% of their weight at baseline was greater in the group of participants receiving methylphenidate than in the group of participants receiving placebo. No other notable drug–placebo differences in adverse events were identified.

This study by Mintzer et al.3 comes at a critical juncture in the history and progression of therapeutic research for AD. This year, aducanumab became the first disease-modifying treatment for AD to be approved by the FDA7. Aducanumab was approved for the treatment of a relatively narrow segment of the AD population — those with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia — on the basis of a treatment-associated reduction in amyloid plaques that was considered reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Of the drugs in the current AD clinical trial pipeline, 104 (83%) are putative disease-modifying treatments developed with the aim of slowing disease progression by altering the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder2. As noted, only nine drugs in the pipeline are being assessed for the treatment of neuropsychiatric syndromes of AD. This disparity is striking, given that the large number of behavioural changes that occur in AD are among the most burdensome elements of the disorder8.

Most of the treatments for behavioural changes in AD that are currently in clinical trials target the syndrome of agitation; a few agents target psychosis, sleep disorders and apathy. The drugs being assessed for the treatment of agitation have an increasing diversity of mechanisms of action. For example, atypical antipsychotics, dextromethorphan combinations, cannabinoids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and α−1 adrenergic blockers are among the agents currently being assessed in clinical trials. Progress is also being made in the treatment of psychosis in AD. A trial published this year tested pimavanserin, an antagonist/inverse agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor approved for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson disease, for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis9. The trial met its primary outcome, and the results might provide a sufficient foundation for the use of pimavanserin as a therapy for dementia-related psychosis.

Progress in the development of disease-modifying treatments for AD is encouraging; the proof-of-concept represented by aducanumab is the first step towards drugs that will delay, halt, or slow the progression of the disease in highly meaningful ways. However, these goals will take many years to reach, and individuals with neuropsychiatric syndromes of AD need treatment now. The results of ADMET 2 represent an important step in the process of advancing needed treatments for AD patients with neuropsychiatric disorders3; development programmes devoted to advancing additional therapies for neuropsychiatric symptoms must be encouraged.
