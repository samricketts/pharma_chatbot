Background:

White matter integrity in aging populations is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline, dementia diagnosis, and mortality. Population-based data can elucidate this association.

Objectives:

To examine the association between white matter integrity, and measured by a clinical rating scale of hyperintensities, and mental status in older adults including advanced aging.

Design:

Scheltens Ratings Scale was used to qualitatively assess white matter (WM) hyperintensities in participants of the Cache County Memory Study (CCMS), an epidemiological study of Alzheimer’s disease in an exceptionally long-lived population. Further, the relation between Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and WM hyperintensities were explored.

Method:

Participants consisted of 415 individuals with dementia and 22 healthy controls.

Results:

CCMS participants, including healthy controls, had high levels of WM pathology as measured by Scheltens Ratings Scale score. While age did not significantly relate to WM pathology, higher Scheltens Ratings Scale scores were associated with lower MMSE findings (correlation between −0.14 &amp; −0.22; p &lt; .05).

Conclusions:

WM pathology was common in this county-wide population sample of those ranging in age from 65 to 106. Increased WM burden was found to be significantly associated with decreased overall MMSE performance.

Introduction

Numerous studies have shown the presence of increased WMHs to be associated with not only cognitive decline but degenerative disorders like AD [1]. Given that mental status testing (e.g., MMSE) is often used as a surrogate of general cognitive functioning, multiple studies have examined the influence of WM integrity on MMSE and general neurocognitive and clinical outcomes. Otsuka et al. [2] previously demonstrated that a decline in MMSE scores in older adults is correlated with white matter integrity (diffuse anisotropy and fractional anisotropy) in the diffuse deep hemispheric white matter and in the corpus callosum, even after controlling for white matter lesion volume and total white matter volume. Quinque and colleagues [3] also demonstrated that scores from visual ratings of white matter change are correlated with performance on multiple processing speed tasks. Studies consistently demonstrate that reduced white matter integrity on diffusion tensor parameters is associated with cognitive functioning in elderly samples both with and without cognitive dysfunction [4]. The presence of white matter burden is also associated with increased risk of dementia [5, 6]. As such, further exploration of the impact of white matter integrity in older adults with and without cognitive decline into advanced age (75 years+) is warranted to delineate factors associated with the relationship between white matter changes and cognition. Understanding the factors that mediate the relationship between white matter change and cognition has important implications for future interventional approaches in Alzheimer’s disease, both to delay onset of symptoms and to slow progression of disease once manifest.

The Cache County Memory Study (CCMS) dataset has provided important insights related to aging and new onset dementia studies [7]. To date, there has not been a comprehensive description of WM findings in the entire Waves 1 and 2 CCMS sample. Likewise, the Scheltens Rating Scale has become one of the standards in the field and the early reports involving the Wave 1 Cohort did not use the Scheltens Rating Scale. Accordingly, this investigation identified WMHs based on the Scheltens Rating Scale in the CCMS population-based sample of individuals with cognitive impairment. Herein we descriptively report these findings for CCMS Waves 1 and 2. Additionally, since the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) was administered at both time points, this investigation sought to compare the relation between MMSE and Scheltens Ratings Scale defined WMHs at both time points in this unique sample of older adults with a mean age of nearly 90 years.

Method

The Cache County Memory Study

The Cache County Memory Study (CCMS) is a population-based study that began in 1994 [8]. The county is located in northeastern Utah with the majority of residents living in a large valley, making it convenient for a county-wide population study of dementia [9, 10]. Because of the exceptional longevity enjoyed in this area, a focus of the CCMS has been to explore the prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) into late old age [8]. At the inception of the CCMS investigation, a county-wide attempt, referred to as “Wave 1” ascertainment, was made to contact everyone 65 years and older (N= 5,677 individuals), of which 5,092 elderly residents (90%) became participants in the longitudinal study. As described by Breitner et al. [8] from this initial ascertainment Wave 1 (1995 – 1997) sample, 335 individuals were assessed to have some form of dementia. In this original cohort of participants, using a 0.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and standard clinical imaging sequences, studies were obtained on 183 individuals with some level of cognitive impairment or dementia [11]. Also as part of the original Wave 1 ascertainment period, 22 individuals assessed to have no dementia, were also imaged as a control sample. Approximately three years later, following a scanner upgrade to 1.5 Tesla a second county-wide ascertainment or “Wave 2” began in 1998 and ran through 2000. In Wave 2 an additional 210 individuals with some form of cognitive impairment or dementia were scanned [10]. Combining Waves 1 and 2, over the two ascertainment periods, a total of 415 individuals were scanned, 205 during Wave 1 and 210 during Wave 2, with no overlap in participants from Wave 1 to Wave 2.

Although there are numerous sophisticated neuroimaging methods for quantifying MRI-identified brain pathology, clinical rating remains a standard interpretive method [12]. Clinical ratings still have great value because they are easy to perform with minimal time requirements, require only conventional clinical imaging sequences and have no elaborate post-processing requirements [13, 14]. Furthermore, studies that have compared clinical ratings with volumetric-based studies or other quantitative methods show reasonable positive correlations [14, 15]. A common clinical rating relevant to the aging process and neuropsychological outcome, including degenerative disease and associated neuropsychological impairment has been MRI identification of white matter (WM) abnormalities classified as WM hyperintensities (WMHs) [16]. This was previously done for CCMS Wave 1 participants using a simplified rating scale [17], but no ratings have yet been done for the Wave 2 data. One of the most common and widely used clinical rating methods for identifying hyperintense signal abnormalities is the Scheltens Rating Scale [18]. This method allows for a standardized assessment with a recognizable metric which then can be used for comparing scans within and between subjects across multiple raters and imaging sessions.

A challenge in performing the Scheltens WMH rating method with the legacy CCMS MRI database is that in addition to the change in scanners and magnetic field strength there were also changes in scan sequences used to assess WM integrity. During the latter part of the 1990’s, the fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence [19] became the standard for WM rating, which was the case for Wave 2. Prior to that, WM pathology was defined on the T2 and proton density (PD) sequences, which was the case for Wave 1. The differences in detecting WM pathology between FLAIR and T2/PD based methods are particularly evident when lesion size, location, frequency and volume are compared but less of a problem when just simple detection (i.e., presence/absence) of a WMH is the criterion [20]. Given the differences in field strength used during image acquisition between Waves 1 and 2 and that a dual-echo T2/PD sequence was not performed during Wave 2, only WM ratings based on the FLAIR sequence were used for Wave 2. Comparing PD versus FLAIR in their ability to detect pathology have been reported for a variety of disorders, and while the FLAIR is more sensitive in lesion conspicuity and detection, and especially lesion size [21, 22], differences may not necessarily be present on qualitative rating scales [22]. The reason for this is that rating scales are typically ordinal with various classification ranges and rating schemas rather than the interval or ratio scales used in size or volume quantification. With an ordinal rating scale, only a threshold level of pathology is needed for classification rather than an absolute size or volume difference.

Participants

Subjects were drawn from the Cache County, Utah, population-based study [8]. Table 1 provides total sample and Wave 1 and 2 demographics. Additional, detailed descriptions of the CCMS MRI methods and ascertainment have been published elsewhere [23, 24]. In general, as shown in Table 1, age and age ranges, educational levels were similar between Waves 1 and 2 although some differences were statistically present (see Supplementary Table 1–3). Since subjects in Wave 1 were not rescanned at Wave 2, no within-subject comparisons could be made pitting T2/PD to FLAIR.

Measurement instrument

MRI acquisition

In the original Wave 1 cohort, MRI studies were obtained with a 0.5 Tesla field-strength scanner, a clinical imaging standard at that time but at the conclusion of Wave 1 ascertainment there was a change in scanner and magnet field strength. All subsequent images for Wave 2 scanned participants were obtained at 1.5 Tesla. Since this was the only MRI facility in the entire county, there was no alternative imaging center closer than approximately 50 miles away making it impossible to retain a comparable scanner or field strength for Wave 2 neuroimaging.

All subjects underwent MRI with Wave 1 participants scanned on a 0.5 Tesla Phillips MRI scanner while Wave 2 participants were analyzed on a 1.5 Tesla Siemens MRI scanner. Imaging at 0.5 Tesla utilized a quadrature head coil with the following sequence details: T1-weighted sequence (TR (ms) 500 and TE of 15) with 2 excitations with an acquisition matrix of 256 X 256 with field of view (FOV) at 24 cm, slice thickness of 5mm and gap at 1 mm; axial T2-weighted and PDI sequences (TR (ms) 3148, TE of 31) with 90/1 excitations. Acquisition matrix was 256 X 256 with a FOV of 22 cm, slice thickness of 5mm and a gap of 1.5 mm; coronal dual spin-echo sequence (TR (ms) 3046 and a TE of 30) with 90/1 excitations. Acquisition matrix was 256 X 240 and FOV of 22 cm, slice thickness of 3mm and a gap of 0.3mm.

The 1.5 Tesla scans were obtained using the circular polarized array head coil with the following sequence parameters: Sagittal 1.5 Tesla scans were acquired using a T1 sequence (TR (ms) 500, TE of 14) with 1 excitation with an acquisition matrix of 256 X 192 with a FOV of 22 cm, slice thickness of 5mm, and gap at 1.5 mm. Flip angle was 90; T2, PDI and FLAIR sequences were all obtained in the axial plane, with the T2 sequence (TR (ms) of 6940, TE of 119) with 2 excitations and an acquisition matrix was 512 X 237 with a FOV of 17.5 X 22 cm, slice thickness of 4 mm, and gap at 0.8mm. Flip angle was 170; the PDI sequence (TR (ms) of 3000, TE of 17) with 1 excitation and an acquisition matrix of 256 X 202 with a FOV of 17.9 X 22 cm, slice thickness of 4.5mm, gap at 2 mm and a flip angle of 170; the FLAIR sequence (TR (ms) of 9000, TE of 104) with 1 excitation with an acquisition matrix of 256 X 163 with a FOV of 17.5 X 22 cm, slice thickness of 5mm, gap at 2 mm and flip angle of 170; coronal T2-weighted scans (TR (ms) 6940, TE of 119) with 2 excitations with an acquisition matrix of 512 X 237 with a FOV of 16.7 X 21 cm, slice thickness of 5 mm, gap at 1 mm and a flip angle of 170.

For the Wave 1 Scheltens ratings were performed using the T2 and PD sequences. For Wave 2 ratings were based on T2 and FLAIR. Figure 1 depicts two participants, Wave 1 and 2 showing differences in scan parameters and identification of WMHs.

Procedure

Scheltens Ratings Scale

The Scheltens Ratings Scale [18] identifies periventricular, white matter, basal ganglia and infratentorial signal hyperintensities. The scoring procedures of the original Scheltens Ratings Scale were followed. A training program was initiated with two samples of 10 subjects each from the CCMS data. The first batch of 10 were done for initial training purposes to match an already established expert (EDB) rating. Inter-rater reliability data was not assessed. However, once a 90% or higher accuracy was achieved, the rater moved on to the second sample of 10. Again, each rater had to achieve 90% accuracy before moving on to the entire sample. Each rater was blind to age, sex or diagnosis with each scan independently rated by a minimum of two raters. After rating, if findings were discrepant by more than two rating points per category the raters independently rated the scans a second time, again independently and not knowing where the discrepancy was. If the discrepancy persisted between the two independent raters, EDB arbitrated the final rating. In all cases, the final Scheltens Rating was based on the average of the two independently rated scores per scan.

As stated in the original guidelines for the Scheltens Ratings Scale, it provides “four sum scores in a semi-quantitative way” [18]. The four scores, as already mentioned consist of periventricular hyperintensities (PVH), lobar white matter hyperintensities (WMH), basal ganglia hyperintensities (BGH), and infratentorial foci of hyperintensity (IFH). Except for PVH, which were rated from 0-3, all the other scores were rated from 0-6, with higher scores representing a greater degree of WMH.

Mini-Mental State Exam [25]

All participants in the CCMS with suspected cognitive disorders and a panel of healthy controls (N = 22) underwent a full clinical evaluation of dementia. This evaluation included a clinical history, physical and neurological evaluation, informant-based interviews, standard laboratory chemistry to rule out treatable systemic conditions, and a neuropsychological battery of tests. Included in the neuropsychological battery was the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) which was uniformly administered to all participants using the standard administration format.

Statistical Analyses

Basic mean differences on Scheltens Ratings between groups were statistically compared with T tests. Pearson product moment correlation (r) were used to assess the relationship between Scheltens Ratings and MMSE scores. We also conducted Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) examining several variables, including age, education, WMH, BGH, IFH, PVH, Scheltens Total Score, and MMSE score. The effects of sex on these factors was also explored with ANOVA Tukey HSD Test Mean Comparison.

Study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Utah State, Duke, and the Johns Hopkins Universities at the time of study enrollment and the archival analysis of the data for the current manuscript was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham Young University.

Results

Scheltens Ratings for total sample across Waves 1 and 2

Table 2 summarizes Scheltens Ratings for all participants across both Waves 1 and 2. Hyperintense signal abnormalities were present in control participants as well as those with cognitive impairment/dementia. As a group, the control sample (mean age = 90.45, S.D. = 5.5) was older than the mean age of either the Wave 1 (mean age = 87.31, S.D. = 6.62) or Wave 2 (mean age = 89.27, S.D. = 5.38) cognitive impairment/dementia samples, although these differences were not statistically significant. In this elderly sample, age was not related to WMH, IFH, BGH or PVH ratings (p&gt;0.05). Likewise, even though the ‘Healthy Control’ participants had been screened for dementia and not found to meet criteria for any dementing illness, as a group they had WMHs at a level similar and not significantly different from those with dementing illnesses (see Table 2). Removing healthy controls, which were only assessed at Wave 1, Table 3 compares Scheltens Rating by Wave 1 and Wave 2. Wave 1 participants exhibited significantly higher WMH, BGH, PVH and Scheltens Total Score rating than Wave 2 participants.

Scheltens Rating and MMSE

As shown in Table 4, the expected higher Scheltens Rating scores, indicating increased levels of pathology, were associated with lower MMSE scores. Regardless of whether assessed at Wave 1 or Wave 2, WMH, PVH and Total Scheltens score were significantly correlated with MMSE. Plots comparing Wave 1 and Wave 2 MMSE performance by WMH and Total Scheltens Ratings are presented in Figure 2. Clearly notable in the scatter plots is that in Wave 1 more participants had lower MMSE scores, suggesting that overall as a group Wave 1 participants had greater levels of cognitive impairment. In support of that supposition, the group mean MMSE score at Wave 1 was significantly lower than the group MMSE mean at Wave 2 (see Table 2 Supplementary Table).

Discussion

As noted, both controls and those with dementia displayed WMH, although age was not statistically associated with WNH in this sample. However, higher Scheltens Rating scores were statistically correlated with MMSE performance. Since the CCMS represents one of the major population-based longitudinal studies of advanced aging, we felt that it was important to better characterize white matter pathology in this cohort because of the important role that such pathology plays in aging and neurodegenerative disease [16]. As expected, in this elderly CCMS sample increased levels of WM pathology as reflected in high Scheltens Ratings were associated with worse MMSE performance, although less robust in the Wave 2 cohort. The reduced association at Wave 2 likely reflects the differences in degree of cognitive impairment between the two waves of ascertainment. Since Wave 1 was the initial county-wide assessment of dementia prevalence in the population, it captured all individuals with cognitive disorders from those with mild dementia to those who were very functionally impaired. By contrast, Wave 2 was designed to capture new incident cases of dementia occurring over an approximately three-year interval. Consequently, by design, incident dementia arising in the population within the three-year window would have included milder cases of cognitive disorder. Indeed, in review of Table 1, overall MMSE score was significantly lower in Wave 1.

Other studies that have used the Scheltens Ratings Scale [15, 26, 27] have found similar results where WM burden as reflected in the overall amount of hyperintense signal abnormality was significantly associated with reduced cognitive performance. Furthermore, as outlined by Tschanz et al. [7] the CCMS study is providing novel insights into the genetics, psychosocial and environmental risk factors of AD, late-life cognitive decline and the clinical progression of dementia after onset. The current legacy CCMS WM Scheltens Ratings will permit further investigation of the role of white matter pathology and clinical correlates, including neuropsychological, relation to neuropsychiatric symptoms and presentation along with functional impairment.

Wave 1 also was the time period where 22 control subjects without dementia at the time scanned were examined. As a group, these healthy yet very elderly controls that averaged 90 years in age did have high Scheltens Rating Scale scores that differed minimally and non-significantly from Wave 1 and 2 participants who had some cognitive impairment or dementing illness, in particular, Wave 2 participants. As reflected in the control sample, in the presence of normal MMSE findings, WMHs do not portend cognitive impairment [28, 29]. However, WM pathology and its severity do show a relationship in those with dementing illness where greater WM abnormalities are associated with lower MMSE scores.

These findings are important given that recent studies of white matter integrity measured with visual rating scales differentiate clinical groups, including vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, where deep white matter hyperintensities increase risk of vascular dementia [6]. Additional research also demonstrates that visual rating of white matter lesions among older adults with cerebrovascular disease increases the risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia (3.5 to 3.8-fold increase) [5].

While multiple studies have examined the association of white matter integrity and cognition, few have reported specifically on MMSE. The results of the current study are important because of the unique population of older adults that make up the Cache County data. Data from the Rotterdam Scan Study [30] examined change in MMSE scores from baseline to follow-up (mean interval 3.4 years) in a prospective study of older adults, and examined this change in association with visual rating scores of white matter lesions. Consistent with the present study, van Dijk and colleagues demonstrated that periventricular white matter lesions were associated with a decline in MMSE across the study period. Similarly, Defrancesco and colleagues [31] examined the influence of neuropsychological tests, including the MMSE, and white matter lesion burden on the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to dementia. They demonstrated that visual ratings of white matter lesion burden are predictive of orientation from the MMSE and total MMSE scores, and that increase in white matter burden over time was associated with a decline in MMSE and performance on an object naming test. Additionally, individuals in this study who converted from mild cognitive impairment to dementia had higher white matter lesion burden, particularly in periventricular regions, on visual rating scales compared to non-converters. While not with a visual rating system, Li et al. [32] similarly demonstrated that mean diffusivity of the corpus callosum is negatively correlated with performance on the MMSE, but only among older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment – multidomain subtype. The current findings offer supportive data of the association between WM burden and general cognitive functioning in older adults with dementia.

There are several prominent limitations of the current study. In samples younger than the current sample of Cache County participants, MMSE may not be impacted by white matter change. For example, in a study of middle-aged adults (mean age between 59-61), MMSE scores were not related to periventricular hyperintensities nor deep white matter hyperintensities [33]. As such, the effects of WM burden on MMSE scores may be mediated by age or other factors common in older populations relative to middle-aged groups. It is also possible that while WM burden can impact some aspects of cognition in younger adults (e.g., processing speed), the MMSE and similar tests with low ceiling effects, are simply not sensitive enough in younger adults. Given that the CCMS study participants are relatively older, the impact of younger age is unclear in the current study.

In addition, the noted white matter pathology and associated clinical ratings are putatively related to cerebrovascular disease. That is, as cerebrovascular disease increases, microvascular ischemic injury occurs, resulting in vascular cognitive impairment. However, research on the MMSE versus other mental status examinations suggest that other measures may be more sensitive to vascular pathology. For example, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one such measure that demonstrates superior sensitivity to cognitive change of a vascular etiology (Van Heugten, Walton, &amp; Hentschel, 2015: PMID 25381346). As such, the use of the MMSE, which was the gold standard at the time of data collection, is limited relative to other possible measures.

The current findings are also considered in the context of recent literature indicating that the impact of white matter burden on cognition may also be mediated by other pathological factors. Specifically, the relative importance of white matter lesions in understanding clinical cognitive functioning was called into question in a recent study by Claus et al. [34]. These authors examined visual ratings of white matter lesions in connection to cognitive functioning while also attempting to understand the impact of medial temporal lobe atrophy. They demonstrated that while white matter lesions do predict non-memory cognitive performances, the amount of variance accounted for in memory performance was largely mediated by medial temporal atrophy, not white matter integrity. They further argued that non-memory performances are related to white matter only when medial temporal atrophy is present, and even then, white matter lesions only account for a small amount of the variance. The presence of media temporal abnormalities was not assessed in the current study.

The difference in field strength and different MR platforms represents a major limitation. Nonetheless, generally comparable findings whether using 0.5 Tesla or 1.5 provided a method for qualitative ratings that related to cognitive (MMSE) status. Since image acquisition was not compatible with any current methods for automated image quantification, the current findings cannot be related to other aspects of contemporary imaging used to quantify white matter integrity, like diffusion tensor imaging. The control sample was small and not well stratified by age. Now that these WM ratings have been completed for the CCMS study, this will permit investigation of the role of WM pathology in healthy aging and dementia including pre-morbid health and lifestyle where neuroimaging factors have not been explored [see 3 &amp; 22]. This study demonstrates that the Scheltens Rating System can be effectively applied to an older community-based population sample using different scanners and image platforms. The ease with which the Scheltens Ratings can be made and the fact that they relate to cognitive outcome adds to the literature on the use of white matter pathology in aging and dementia. A recent review on WMH, cognitive, and dementia provides an update on the relationship between WMH and cognitive decline and provides support for continued investigation of clinical ratings [16]. While visual-based clinical rating scales may not be the best for measuring progression of white matter pathology, their ease and universal applicability are well suited for clinical use. Improved understanding of the clinical significance of white matter findings in the process of aging and neurodegenerative disease, especially how more elaborate neuroimaging methods quantify white matter pathology and relate to clinical ratings, will likely add to the utility of these simple rating methods that can be applied to any individual who has undergone an MRI.
