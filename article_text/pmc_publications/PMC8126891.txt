An in vitro effect of (+)MK-801 (dizocilpine), an inhibitor of the glutamate/NMDA and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, on the Aβ[1–42] and Aβ[1–40] peptides is described and compared to that of memantine. Memantine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild-moderate Alzheimer’s Disease. Both compounds accelerated the formation of a β-sheet structure by Aβ[1–42], (+)MK-801 more rapidly than memantine, as observed in a Thioflavin T fluorescence assay. The acceleration was followed by a decrease in the fluorescent signal that was not observed when the ligand was absent. NMR spectra of the soluble peptides in the presence and absence of (+)MK-801 demonstrated that the monomeric form did not bind (+)MK-801 and that in the presence of (+)MK-801 the concentration of the monomeric form progressively decreased. Small angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS) confirmed that the presence of (+)MK-801 resulted in a more rapid and characteristic transition to an insoluble form. These results suggest that (+)MK-801 and memantine accelerate the transition of Aβ[1–42] and [1–40] to ThT-negative insoluble forms.

INTRODUCTION

Post-mortem examination or live imaging of the brain of an individual with Alzheimer’s Disease reveals the presence of extracellular plaques of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. β-Amyloid peptides and tau protein precede Alzheimer’s Disease symptoms.1

In the amyloidogenic pathway, aggregated Aβ peptides (Aβ peptides in soluble and insoluble non-monomeric states) are formed following β- and γ-secretase degradation of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), generating the N- and C-terminus of Aβ respectively. Aβ peptides occur in two main isoforms of 40 and 42 amino acids. Soluble Aβ monomers are intrinsically disordered, but they can form soluble oligomers with β-sheet structure2 and insoluble fibrils. Plaques are subsequently formed from insoluble highly ordered, unbranched amyloid fibrils.3,4

Harkany et al.5 reported that application of Aβ[1–42]-triggered excitotoxicity via the NMDA receptor, which could be prevented by (+)MK-801 (dizocilpine, developed by Merck6 as a noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor). But (+)MK-801 causes cytoplasmic vacuoles in select neurons7 and is no longer used clinically in the USA. Memantine, at therapeutic concentrations, protects against Aβ-induced neuronal degeneration.8 Although the direct effect on NMDA receptors is undoubtedly important, memantine can also reduce the production of Aβ,9,10 possibly through APP trafficking.11 However, Takahashi-Ito et al.12 suggested that memantine decreases the formation of β-amyloid aggregates and disassembles preformed aggregates as detected by Thioflavin T (ThT) assays and electron microscopy.

We show here that initially (+)MK-801 and memantine accelerate the formation of β-sheet structure by Aβ[1–42] as measured by ThT. After several hours, the ThT signal of the peptide in the presence of (+)MK-801 or memantine drops dramatically below the level of the peptide alone. Although this might be consistent with a return to monomers NMR spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering (BioSAXS) suggested that the ThT signal decrease is associated with a progressively increased particle size and insoluble aggregate production. While memantine may have a modest beneficial effect on the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease, our results suggest that its clinical effect may not be associated with inhibition of insoluble aggregate formation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We tested four dilutions of Aβ[1–42], ranging from 3.25-μM to 30-μM, for β-sheet formation using the ThT assay (Figure 1A). The ThT signal increased to a plateau within two hours. The plateau level and rate of increase of the signal both increased with peptide concentration. In the presence of (+)MK-801, the rate of increase was greater than that in the drug’s absence. After an interval, the length of which was dependent upon the peptide concentration, the fluorescence underwent a dramatic decline. Increasing the peptide concentration further (Figure 1B) resulted in an earlier decline. Depending upon the Aβ[1–42] concentration, the rate of signal increase is greater in the presence of (+)MK-801 but not highly dependent upon the (+)MK-801 concentration in the 0.25- to 2-mM range (Figure 1C). However, the subsequent signal decrease is highly dependent upon drug concentration, with initiation of the decline occurring at increasingly shorter times with increased drug concentration. The plateau of the signal is the same in the presence and absence of the lower (+)MK-801 concentrations. That is, the decline does not seem to be triggered by a given β-sheet content, but more likely by some higher-order structure (Figure S1).

The results for Aβ[1–40] (Figure S2) were qualitatively similar to those obtained with Aβ[1–42]. Memantine effects on β-sheet formation by Aβ[1–42] were also similar to but less potent than those observed with (+)MK-801 (Figure 1D). The loss of signal due to 2-mM (+)MK-801 occurs in the range of 80–120 min with 30 to 35-μM Aβ[1–42]; at 2-mM memantine the signal loss at the same peptide concentration occurs at approximately 450 min.

It was unclear from these experiments whether the accelerated β-sheet structure formation by Aβ[1–42] in the presence of (+)MK-801 is followed by disintegration into monomers or by changes in the peptide structure associated with further aggregation. Electron microscopy (Figure S3) suggested it was the latter. The question was investigated further using two techniques, neither of which requires a reporter molecule, such as ThT, with the potential of affecting the results. NMR spectroscopy was applied to address two questions: (1) Does (+)MK-801 interact with the Aβ monomer? (2) After initial acceleration of β-sheet formation of, does (+)MK-801 cause disintegration of the oligomeric state back to monomers?

15N-Aβ[1–42] samples were prepared with and without (+)MK-801 (molar ratio of 50:1), and 1H,15N-HSQC spectra (Figure 2) were recorded. In the presence of (+)MK-801, only minimal chemical shift perturbation was observed at the three histidines (due to minute differences in the sample pH) and no line broadening was observed. Clearly, (+)MK-801 does not bind to the Aβ[1–42] in the soluble monomeric state. Similar results were observed with Aβ[1–40] (Figure S4).

1D spectra of the peptide in the absence and presence of 2-mM (+)MK-801 were recorded and the methyl peaks integrated. The goal was to mimic conditions of the ThT experiment as closely as possible, necessitating a low peptide concentration (in terms of NMR). The experiment could not be done with memantine because of peak overlap between the drug and the peptide. In contrast to the biphasic behavior in the ThT assay, a monotonic decrease in the integrated methyl peaks over time was observed (Figure 2A), presumably due to Aβ aggregation and line broadening. (+)MK-801 accelerated the line broadening, with a rapid signal loss before the first timepoint followed by a slower loss on the scale of hours. To eliminate that the initial drop was due to different concentrations of peptide between the (+)MK-801 and control conditions, in a subsequent experiment (+)MK-801 was added 60-min following the start. The addition of (+)MK-801 resulted in rapid signal loss and a timecourse that mirrored that observed when (+)MK-801 was present initially. The timecourse of the loss of integrated methyl peaks in the presence and absence of (+)MK-801 was compared (Figure 2B) to the timecourse of the ThT signal in the presence of (+)MK-801 (inverted to compare to the NMR data). Clearly, the initial loss of monomers in NMR follows the ThT timecourse up to the point at which the ThT signal dramatically declines. Combined, these results suggest that declining fluorescence in the presence of (+)MK-801 reflects the loss, and lack of reappearance, of monomers.

BioSAXS is a powerful method for analyzing the size and shape of protein and DNA particles, and was used to examine Aβ peptides.13 The Guinier plot (Figure 3) of 35-μM Aβ[1–42] alone has a clearly observable linear region and, at later times, I(0) increases and the plot takes on a slight curvature, indicating increased aggregation and, possibly, polydispersity. In the presence of (+)MK-801, the first measurement indicates nonlinearity, consistent with increased aggregation and polydispersity. This becomes more pronounced at later timepoints. To capture the aggregation, the Guinier plot initial slope was used to calculate Rg (radius of gyration) and I(0) (forward scattering), and a constant range of q-values across incubation times was used to capture the initial slope. Although these reciprocal space parameters rely on the lowest resolution data, the change as a function of time (Figure 4A) for 35- and 83-μM Aβ[1–42] suggests that aggregation is initially accelerated in the presence of (+)MK-801 and occurs more rapidly at the higher Aβ[1–42] concentration, in agreement with the ThT data. Furthermore, the Rg value measured at the first timepoint (15 min. after the peptide solution was prepared from the lyophilized sample) is significantly higher than expected from a 42-amino-acid peptide, suggesting that some oligomerization was present prior to the first data point. The data collection was terminated earlier in the presence of (+)MK-801 than in its absence because precipitates were observed in the capillary tube by video camera. This was not due to radiation damage in that it was not observed in the absence of (+)MK-801, but was observed in a portion of the sample containing (+)MK-801 that was stored outside the instrument throughout the timecourse and tested at the end of the experiment.

The pair distance distribution function (P(r)) was determined for each scattering profile (Figure 4B). Although in the absence of (+)MK-801 the distribution indicates a modest increase in particle size with time, the addition of (+)MK-801 changes the distribution dramatically toward larger particles, with Dmax values more than twice those in the absence of (+)MK-801. The P(r)-derived values of Rg and I(0) (Real Space), based on the entire scattering curve (Figure 4A), were similar to (although somewhat larger than) the values derived from the Guinier plot and followed the same timecourse.

The results of the BioSAXS data are consistent with, and provide additional information relative to, the results obtained with the ThT assay. The fluorescence signal increases more rapidly in the presence than in the absence of (+)MK-801. The signal in the (+)MK-801 sample declines dramatically after a given and very reproducible time (approximately two hours at 35-μM Aβ[1–42]). The SAXS profile shows a dramatic increase in I(0) at this time and subsequently the observed precipitation precluded further scattering measurements. This suggests that the decline observed in the ThT assay is a signal loss not due to disaggregation, an interpretation also supported by the NMR spectroscopy data.

(+)MK-801 and memantine bind to and inhibit NMDA receptors, and memantine has a beneficial effect in early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease through this mechanism.8 Nevertheless, there is some evidence, particularly in the case of memantine, that these drugs affect the levels of Aβ peptides in the brain.9,10 The questions arise then, whether these drugs can bind to Aβ peptides and, if so, what effect they have on the peptide. 1H,15N-HSQC NMR experiments with Aβ[1–40] and Aβ[1–42] showed no indication of (+)MK-801 binding to monomers. Therefore (+)MK-801 must interact with another state of the peptide. Monitoring β-sheet formation using ThT over the first few hours provided evidence for what seemed to be complex, biphasic effects of (+)MK-801 and memantine. The ThT signal increased faster in the presence of (+)MK-801 than in its absence and then decreased dramatically. The subsequent decrease in signal could arise from several factors: unbinding of ThT, loss of β-sheet content and reformation of monomers, insoluble precipitates, etc. The 1D NMR spectra suggest that the transition away from the monomer follows the timecourse of the increase in ThT signal, but a reversion to the monomeric state is not observed. The BioSAXS experiments show an increase in polydispersity and particle size followed by precipitation of the sample. Thus, the loss of ThT signal is not due to the reformation of monomers and is accompanied by insoluble precipitates.

Although the major effect of memantine is thought to be an interaction with the NMDA receptor,8 the levels of Aβ peptides are also affected.9,10 The results reported here do suggest that insoluble structures may be more readily formed in the presence of (+)MK-801 or memantine.
