Objective:

The degree to which Alzheimer’s versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia attributable to pathologic AD and 8 other neuropathologies.

Methods:

Participants (n = 1,161) came from 2 clinical-pathological studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of 8 neuropathological indices with Alzheimer’s dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Furthermore, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re-estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.

Results:

Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer’s dementia at time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathological indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer’s dementia. Two hundred ten (41.0%) Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, 8.1% to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 6.0% to atherosclerosis, and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all 8 indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all 8 neuropathologic indices combined.

Interpretation:

Pathological AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer’s dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two-thirds of Alzheimer’s dementia cases are attributable to common age-related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important.


pmcMore than 5 million Americans and 46 million persons worldwide currently suffer from Alzheimer’s dementia, and these numbers will increase dramatically in the coming years as the population ages.1 Prevention of Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health and economic priority but has proven a formidable challenge, in large part because of the complexity of the disease. Whereas it was long thought that Alzheimer’s dementia was the result of a singular disease process, it is now clear that it is most commonly the result of mixed neuropathologies.2–5 That is, although Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is nearly ubiquitous in the brains of persons with Alzheimer’s dementia, multiple additional age-related neuropathologies are frequently present in the aging brain and independently associated with the likelihood of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s dementia.6–16 Notably, however, common neuropathological indices only account for a portion of the variance in age-related cognitive decline, in part because additional, but less well-studied, pathological factors (eg, inflammation) likely also are important determinants of late-life cognitive decline and dementia; furthermore, we have identified other factors that are associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s dementia but are not related to any measured neuropathological index.17,28 Together, these data suggest that AD pathology, specifically neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, only accounts for a portion of all Alzheimer’s dementia cases. However, the degree to which AD versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia is not well established.18–20 Knowledge of the degree to which AD and other neuropathologies contribute to Alzheimer’s dementia is critical for the development of effective therapies to prevent dementia and for understanding the potential impact of therapeutic agents.

In this study, we estimated the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia attributable to standard neuropathological indices of AD and 8 other common age-related neuropathologies. Participants were more than 1,000 deceased persons from two longitudinal epidemiologic, clinical-pathological studies of aging; all underwent detailed clinical evaluations and autopsy.21,22 Neuropathological examinations identified standard indices of pathological AD, macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis. Multivariable logistic regression models were first used to examine associations of the 9 neuropathological indices with the odds of Alzheimer’s dementia and then to quantify the percentage of cases attributable to each. Next, because most cases of Alzheimer’s dementia are in fact attributed to mixed disease and estimates based on individual neuropathologies do not account for comorbidity, we conducted further analyses in which we quantified the percentage of cases attributable to specific classes of neuropathologies and then all of the neuropathological indices together. Finally, because some Alzheimer’s dementia cases are driven by factors other than those measured here, we repeated the core analyses with an additional term for empirically derived Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by these neuropathological indices and generated adjusted attributable risk estimates.

Subjects and Methods

Participants

Participants were deceased persons from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathological studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project. These studies were approved by the Rush University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (Chicago, IL), and consent and an anatomical gift act were obtained from each participant. At the time of these analyses (September 2017), 3,319 older persons were enrolled and completed baseline evaluations. Of the 1,692 individuals who had died, 1,465 underwent brain autopsy with an overall autopsy rate of 86.6%. Of these, we excluded individuals for whom data collection for 1 or more of the 9 neuropathologies was ongoing (N = 276), individuals with pending clinical diagnosis (N = 5), or with a diagnosis other than Alzheimer’s dementia (N = 23). Analyses were performed on the remaining 1,161 older persons.

Clinical Evaluation and Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Dementia

All participants underwent uniform clinical evaluations at baseline and annually thereafter, which included a neurological exam and a standardized battery of 21 cognitive performance tests, 19 of which were in common.17,23,24 The Mini-Mental State Examination and Complex Ideational Material were used for descriptive purposes or diagnostic classification, respectively. Performance on the remaining 17 cognitive tests was used to summarize cognitive function, and dementia diagnoses were made annually by a trained clinician according to the criteria of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association; these criteria were used in part for consistency with our previous work as well as for consistency with the majority of work to date on the clinical syndrome of Alzheimer’s dementia. Alzheimer’s dementia proximate to death was diagnosed by a board-certified neurologist after review of all available clinical information.4,17,23

Neuropathological Evaluation

Brain autopsy procedures have been described in detail and were done by examiners blinded to all clinical information.5,11,12,14 Briefly, brains were removed, weighed, and hemispheres were cut coronally using a Plexiglas jig into 1-cm slabs. One hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After gross examination of both hemispheres, 9 brain regions of interest (ie, midfrontal, midtemporal, inferior parietal, anterior cingulate, entorhinal and hippocampal cortices, basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain) were dissected from fixed tissue and processed and embedded in paraffin. Sections (6 μm) from paraffin blocks were stained for assessment of pathology.

AD pathology (ie, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) was visualized using a modified Bielschowsky silver stain, and the presence of pathological AD was determined according to modified recommendations of the National Institute on Aging (NIA)–Reagan criteria (ie, intermediate or high likelihood); although newer criteria have been developed, these criteria were used to maintain consistency with our approach in numerous previous publications.3,5,12 Gross (chronic) infarcts were identified visually and confirmed histologically, and microinfarcts (chronic) were identified under microscopy using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain.3,5 Presence of Lewy body pathology was determined using antibodies to α-synuclein. Presence of hippocampal sclerosis was determined using H&amp;E stain on a section of midhippocampus.12 Presence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions was determined using antibodies to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pS409/410; 1:100); TDP-43 distribution was grouped into 3 stages (stage 1, localized to amygdala; stage 2, extension to hippocampus or entorhinal cortex; stage 3, extension to the neocortex), and TDP-43 was considered present if positive for stages 2 or 3.4,14 Moderate–severe arteriolar sclerosis was detected by use of H&amp;E-stained sections of the anterior basal ganglia and based on subjective ratings by the neuropathologists.13 Moderate–severe atherosclerosis was detected by visual inspection of vessels in the circle of Willis, and semiquantitative ratings were based on the number of vessels involved and severity of vessel disease.13 Moderate–severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (parenchymal and meningeal) was detected using amyloid-β immunostaining in 4 cortical regions, and semiquantitative ratings were based on circumferential staining, number of vessels stained, and percent of the cortex and/or meninges affected.11

Statistical Analyses

We first examined the association of pathological AD with Alzheimer’s dementia using a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for age at death, sex, and years of education. The model used Alzheimer’s dementia as the binary outcome, and the presence of high or intermediate likelihood of AD according to modified NIA Reagan criteria was the predictor. The corresponding regression coefficient, after exponentiating, estimates the odds ratio (OR) of Alzheimer’s dementia in individuals with pathological AD relative to those without. Next, to examine the association of the other 8 neuropathological indices with Alzheimer’s dementia, we augmented the model by including terms for the pathological indices of cerebral infarcts, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis. Overall predictive ability of the model was estimated using the concordance index, or the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, where a value of 0.5 indicates random guessing and a value of 1.0 is equivalent to perfect prediction.25 To illustrate how incorporation of neuropathological indices improved the prediction of AD dementia, we compared areas under ROC curves from the models with and without those indices.26 Notably, the order in which variables are entered into the model influences the increase in area under the ROC curves associated with each variable or set of variables. Because the aim of this study was to determine the degree to which AD and other neuropathologies contribute to Alzheimer’s dementia, we first added pathological AD to the initial model with demographics; we then added the non-AD neuropathologies.

Next, we used the results from the fully adjusted logistic regression model (including terms for demographics and all neuropathologies) to estimate the fraction of Alzheimer’s dementia cases that were attributable to pathological AD and the other neuropathological indices. Logistic regression preserves the marginal probability of Alzheimer’s dementia, such that the sum of person-specific probabilities of Alzheimer’s dementia, as estimated from the model, would be equal to the total observed Alzheimer’s dementia cases in the data, that is, ∑i=1NP^i=D, where N was the total sample size, D was total number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases observed, and P^i was model estimated probability of Alzheimer’s dementia for subject i. Utilizing this property, we derived the fraction of Alzheimer’s dementia cases attributable to pathological AD and the other neuropathological indices. To illustrate, we “removed” the effect of pathological AD by setting the indicator for pathological AD to 0 in calculating P^i. Denoted P^i′ the newly estimated probability of Alzheimer’s dementia for subject ∑i=1NP^i′ was the estimated number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases if pathological AD was absent. The fraction attributable to pathological AD was then estimated by (D−∑i=1NP^i′)/D, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was obtained using bootstrap with 10,000 replications. This same approach was then applied for each of the other neuropathological indices. Furthermore, because most cases of dementia are in fact attributed to mixed disease and estimates based on individual indices do not account for comorbidity, we quantified the percentage of cases attributable to specific combinations of the neuropathological indices and all of them combined.

Importantly, previous work has shown that the standard neuropathological indices of common age-related diseases account for only around half of the variability in cognitive decline, and many factors related to risk of Alzheimer’s dementia are not related to measured pathological indices17,28,32; thus, it is clear that some Alzheimer’s dementia cases are driven by factors other than the neuropathological indices included here. To address this important conceptual challenge, we next repeated the core logistic regression analyses after adjustment for empirically derived Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by the neuropathological indices. This adjustment provides a surrogate indicator of those potential cases in which dementia is attributed to other factors. We determined this number by identifying individuals who exhibited cognitive decline consistent with incident Alzheimer’s dementia after accounting for the effects of all of the neuropathological indices. Briefly, we fit linear mixed models using longitudinal change in global cognitive function as the outcome. After adjusting for demographics and all of the neuropathological indices, the model yields a measure of person-specific residual cognitive decline (ie, cognitive decline not accounted for by demographics or the neuropathological indices). We flagged individuals whose residual decline crossed a predetermined threshold equal to the median global cognitive score at the first diagnosis for all incident Alzheimer’s dementia cases. Using this approach, we obtained an indicator variable which was then added to the core logistic regression model in order to account for derived Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by the standard neuropathological indices studied here. All the analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A nominal threshold of p &lt; 0.05 was applied for statistical significance.

Results

A total of 1,161 deceased persons were included in the primary analyses; their characteristics are presented in Table 1. Briefly, mean age at baseline was 80.7 years (standard deviation [SD], 7.0), mean education was 16 years (SD, 3.6), and 68.7% were females. Participants died at an average age of 89.6 years (SD, 6.5). At time of death, 512 (44.1%) of the participants had Alzheimer’s dementia. Neuropathology was nearly ubiquitous, with almost 95% of participants having at least 1 of the measured indices. More than 65% of participants met the modified NIA-Reagan criteria for pathological AD, almost half had chronic macroscopic or microinfarcts, 23.8% had Lewy bodies, 10.3% had hippocampal sclerosis (HS), 33.1% had TDP-43, 36.0% had CAA, 32.6% had atherosclerosis, and 32.0% had arteriolosclerosis. Consistent with our previous reports, comorbidity was common; 79.2% (N = 920) of participants had 2 or more neuropathologies, and 59.5% (N = 691) had 3 or more. Frequencies of common neuropathologies by Alzheimer’s dementia status are illustrated in Figure 1; of note, there is a very heterogeneous array of neuropathologies, both among persons with and without dementia.

We first examined the relation of a pathological diagnosis of AD with Alzheimer’s dementia. This association was strong and highly significant, such that participants with pathological AD had greater than 4 times the odds of Alzheimer’s dementia (OR = 4.90; 95% CI = 3.70–6.48; p &lt; 0.001). Adjustment for age, sex, and education did not change the results (OR = 4.40; 95% CI = 3.30–5.85; p &lt; 0.001). Starting with the model including only demographic terms, area under the ROC curve increased from 0.61 (95% CI = 0.58–0.64; p &lt; 0.001) to 0.70 (95% CI = 0.67–0.73; p &lt; 0.001) after pathological AD was added to the model. This is illustrated in Figure 2.

We next examined the contribution of other neuropathological indices to Alzheimer’s dementia and found that presence of macroscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies, HS, TDP-43, CAA, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis were all associated with greater odds of Alzheimer’s dementia, independent of a pathological diagnosis of AD (Table 2, model 1). We did not find an association of microinfarcts with Alzheimer’s dementia; therefore, the index for microinfarcts was not included in subsequent analyses. When the 8 neuropathological indices were modeled together, area under the ROC curve further increased to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77–0.82; p &lt; 0.001). Figure 2 illustrates that prediction of the model improved after inclusion of non-AD neuropathological indices.

Pathological AD and Alzheimer’s Dementia

Next, we assessed the fraction of Alzheimer’s dementia cases attributable to pathological AD. Based on results from the fully adjusted logistic regression model with terms for demographics, pathological AD, and the other 7 neuropathological indices (Table 2, model 2), we derived subject-specific probabilities of Alzheimer’s dementia, where we set the regression coefficient for pathological AD diagnosis to 0. The sum of these model-derived probabilities provides the expected number of cases with Alzheimer’s dementia if pathological AD was absent (Table 3, column 3). Our result showed that this number was 302.2. As a result, the expected number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases attributable to pathological AD was 209.8. This indicates that 41% of the 512 Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD. The bootstrap analysis showed that the 95% CI for the estimate was from 32.7 to 49.5%.

Other Neuropathological Indices and Alzheimer’s Dementia

Next, we repeated the analysis described above to assess the fractions of Alzheimer’s dementia cases attributable to macroscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies, HS, TDP-43 pathology, CAA, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis, respectively (Table 3). When considered separately, 8.9% (95% bootstrapped CI, 4.4–13.7) of Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to macroscopic infarcts; 10.8% (95% CI, 7.3–14.3) to Lewy bodies, 5.2% (95% CI, 3.1–7.4) to HS, 11.7% (95% CI, 7.0–16.5) to TDP-43, 8.1% (95% CI, 3.5–12.8) to CAA, 6.0% (95% CI, 1.8–10.2) to atherosclerosis, and 5.2% (95% CI, 1.0–9.4) to arteriolosclerosis.

Classes of Neuropathologies and Alzheimer’s Dementia

Next, because attributable risk estimates for each individual pathology do not account for comorbidity among the neuropathologies (and therefore overestimate the risks attributable to an individual neuropathology), we examined associations of specific classes of neuropathologies with Alzheimer’s dementia. First, we examined Alzheimer’s dementia attributable to all of the vascular indices (ie, macroscopic infarcts, CAA, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis), which frequently occur in combination. The expected number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases was 368.4 when these neuropathological indices were absent. Considering that there was a total of 512 observed Alzheimer’s dementia cases, 28.1% (95% CI, 20.4–36.0) were attributable to the 4 vascular indices combined. Next, we examined Alzheimer’s dementia attributable to non-AD neurodegenerative indices (ie, TDP43, HS, and Lewy bodies). The expected number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases was 361.0 when these indices were absent; therefore, 29.5% (95% CI, 23.5–35.5) of cases were attributable to these 3 indices. Finally, we determined the number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases attributable to all 8 neuropathological indices. The expected number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases was 85.5 when all of these indices were absent. As a result, 83.3% (95% CI, 77.9–88.4) of Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to all 8 indices combined.

Analyses Adjusting for Empirically Derived Alzheimer’s Dementia Cases Not Driven by Standard Neuropathological Indices

Importantly, considerable evidence suggests that there is an imperfect association of neuropathology with cognitive status and that pathological indices not studied here likely contribute to dementia, suggesting the need to augment our analyses with an indicator for Alzheimer’s dementia cases driven by factors other than the neuropathological indices studied here. Thus, to empirically derive the number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by common age-related neuropathologies, we first used linear mixed models to characterize decline in cognition after controlling for demographics and all 8 neuropathological indices. This results in person-specific residual cognitive decline slopes; we call this residual cognitive decline because it represents the decline not explained by demographics and neuropathological indices, as described in previous work.17 We began with an unadjusted model with only a term for time, defined as the time (in years) preceding death. In the initial unadjusted model, the global cognitive measure declined a mean of approximately 0.1 unit per year (estimate = −0.101; standard error [SE] = 0.003; p &lt; 0.001). Notably, there was significant between-subject variability; the variance estimate for the individual slopes was 0.009 (SE = 0.001; p &lt; 0.001). Next, we added additional terms for demographics and their interactions with time. Then, we added terms for all 8 of the neuropathological indices and their interactions with time; in this analysis, all of the neuropathological indices were associated with substantially faster rates of decline (Table 4).

Based on the results from the fully adjusted linear mixed-effects model, we created an indicator variable to adjust for Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by the neuropathological indices studied here. This was done by identifying individuals whose residual cognitive decline (ie, decline not explained by demographics and neuropathological indices) crossed the threshold consistent with the median global cognitive score at the first Alzheimer’s dementia diagnosis for all incident cases (global cognitive score = −1.09). Figure 3 shows the person-specific residual cognitive decline slopes, and the horizontal orange line indicates the median global cognitive threshold for Alzheimer’s dementia. Of the 1,161 persons included in this analysis, 12% (95% CI, 10.1–13.9) crossed this threshold. This indicator variable was then added to the core logistic regression model, and attributable risks were recalculated. Not surprisingly, with this additional term included, we observed that area under the ROC curve increased to 0.86 (p &lt; 0.001), indicating improved model fit. Furthermore, as expected, the attributable risks associated with each neuropathological index dropped. When considered separately, 34.5% (95% CI, 26.6–41.5) of Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD, 8.5% (95% CI, 3.9–12.5) to macroscopic infarcts, 9.3% (95% CI, 6.1–12.4) to Lewy bodies, 4.5% (95% CI, 2.5–6.5) to HS, 11.6% (95% CI, 6.8–15.6) to TDP-43, 5.5% (95% CI, 1.3–9.6) to CAA, 4.8% (95% CI, 1.2–8.8) to atherosclerosis, and 3.1% (95% CI, −0.5 to 7.1) to arteriolosclerosis, respectively. Furthermore, in analyses accounting for comorbidity among indices, we found that 21.6% (95% CI, 14.7–28.4) of Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to vascular indices combined and 26.6% (95% CI, 20.8–31.3) to non-AD neurodegenerative indices combined. Finally, in the adjusted analysis, a total of 67.5% (95% CI, 60.9–73.5) of all Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to the 8 neuropathological indices combined.

Secondary Analyses

First, because interactions among the neuropathological indices could have affected the attributable risk estimates reported above, we examined all pairwise interactions among the neuropathological indices. Using backward elimination, where interaction terms which did not meet the 0.05 significance level were removed step by step, only 2 interaction terms were retained in the model: interactions of pathological AD and gross infarcts and HS and CAA. With these included in the model, a total of 88.1% (95% CI, 82.9–92.6) of all Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to the 8 neuropathological indices. This number was reduced to 70.0 (95% CI, 63.4–77.0) after further adjustment for empirically derived cases not accounted for by neuropathology. The clear overlap of these results with those from our primary analysis suggests that the addition of these interactions did not substantially affect the primary results.

Second, because the nominal cutoff of p &lt; 0.05 may not be stringent enough to prevent false positives in certain situations, we reran the primary analyses using a Bonferroni correction (p-value cutoff of 0.005). Using this approach, only 1 of the neuropathologies, arteriolosclerosis, was not retained in the final model. After excluding arteriolosclerosis, the fraction of AD dementia cases attributed to all neuropathologies was 81.7% (95% CI, 76.2–87.1). The fraction after the further adjustment for cases not driven by neuropathology was 66.0% (95% CI, 60.0–72.1). These results therefore were extremely similar to, and lend further confidence in, the primary findings.

Discussion

In this study, we examined the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia attributable to standard neuropathological indices of AD (ie, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and other age-related neuropathologies in more than 1,100 well-characterized older persons who underwent detailed annual cognitive evaluations for up to 22 years preceding death. In the initial analyses, around 40% of Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD, but several other neuropathological indices also contributed, with between 5 and 12% of cases attributable separately to macroscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies, HS, TDP-43 pathology, CAA, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis. After taking into account comorbidity among the neuropathological indices, just over 80% (78–88%) of Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to all 8 neuropathological indices combined. However, in analyses further adjusted for Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by the neuropathological indices, attributable cases dropped such that around 35% were attributable to pathological AD and between 3 and 12% were attributable separately to non-AD neuropathological indices. Furthermore, in the adjusted analysis, a total of around 68% of all Alzheimer’s dementia cases were attributable to the 8 neuropathological indices combined. The finding that considerable pathological heterogeneity underlies clinical Alzheimer’s dementia has important implications for the development of therapeutics to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s dementia.

This study expands previous work in 5 important ways. First, this study illustrates that numerous age-related neuropathologies contribute independently to Alzheimer’s dementia. Although several studies have shown that mixed neuropathology is extremely common in the aging brain and is the most common cause of dementia, previous studies have not examined all of the neuropathological indices studied here and determined the risks attributable to each.3,5,7,16,18–20 As in previous work, pathological AD was the strongest driver of Alzheimer’s dementia, with participants with pathological AD having greater than 4 times the odds of Alzheimer’s dementia, and more than one-third of all dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD.2,18–20 Furthermore, with the exception of microinfarcts, all other neuropathological indices also were independently associated with the odds of Alzheimer’s dementia, with between 3 and 12% of cases attributable to non-AD indices when considered separately. With respect to the association of neuropathological indices with odds of dementia, our findings generally are consistent with previous studies, although conflicting findings have been reported. For example, in a recent study of individuals aged ≥90 years, results indicated no evidence of associations between large infarcts, CAA, and Lewy bodies and dementia.18 In addition, some previous studies have reported associations between microinfarcts and dementia.18–20 The lack of association between microinfarcts and Alzheimer’s dementia here is in keeping with previous findings from our cohorts showing that microinfarcts are not related to late life cognitive decline.17 Furthermore, the sample size here was larger than in most previous studies, and we included 3 types of vessel pathology which were related to dementia here. Taken together, these data suggest that AD pathology is an important, but only 1 of many independent contributors to Alzheimer’s dementia.

Second, this study provides novel information regarding the degree to which classes of comorbid non-AD neuropathologies contribute to Alzheimer’s dementia. We are not aware of previous studies that have examined this issue as done here. When considered simultaneously, vascular indices and non-AD neurodegenerative indices each accounted for roughly 25% of Alzheimer’s dementia cases. The opportunity to consider the cumulative effects of broader classes of disease, while taking into account the intercorrelations among the individual indices in those classes, provides a new perspective on their contribution to dementia. Specifically, whereas vascular and non-AD neurodegenerative indices account for relatively modest percentages of Alzheimer’s dementia cases individually, they do in fact account for a considerable proportion of Alzheimer’s dementias when considered together as classes.

Third, this study raises important questions relevant to clinical trials and drug discovery, as well as current conceptualizations of Alzheimer’s dementia more generally. Currently, the majority of clinical trials and drug development studies focus on symptomatic or disease-modifying treatments for AD neuropathologies, particularly amyloid. Although we agree that pathological AD is the major driver of Alzheimer’s dementia and such treatments should be sought, the present results suggest that we need to temper expectations regarding how much Alzheimer’s dementia can be treated or prevented with such therapies. Therapies that target additional (non-AD) neuropathologies that contribute to Alzheimer’s dementia would provide additional benefit and ultimately will be essential to the prevention of dementia. It is noteworthy, however, that in a recent study of just over 1,000 older persons, we reported more than 250 unique combinations of neuropathologies (with more than one-third of persons having 4 or more).27 To complicate matters further, the impact of any given neuropathology on cognition varies depending on the other neuropathologies present, and the presence of neuropathology does not always lead to dementia.27 The present findings suggest that Alzheimer’s dementia is a syndrome of multiple and heterogeneous processes and highlight the urgent need for therapeutic interventions that address the remarkable neuropathological heterogeneity underlying Alzheimer’s dementia. They also suggest that diagnostic approaches/participant selection and power considerations will be critical in any planned trials.

Fourth, these findings underscore a need for novel or complementary approaches to prevent or treat Alzheimer’s dementia. Many risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia have been identified, including psychological (eg, purpose in life, depressive symptoms), experiential (eg, cognitive and social activity), and genomic factors, most of which are related to dementia independent of neuropathology.28–32 Some such factors (eg, purpose in life) provide a buffer against the deleterious effects of neuropathology.32 An increased focus on factors that promote cognitive resilience in the face of accumulating neuropathology may facilitate novel therapeutic approaches that can be applied to the population more broadly than interventions targeting neuropathological indices such as amyloid.33 Such interventions would offer complementary strategies to the amyloid-focused efforts and could have considerable public health benefit.

Finally, this study incorporated an empirically derived indicator for Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by the neuropathological indices studied here. The model in which we included this adjustment showed improved model fit. This approach allowed us to address an important issue not considered in previous work and to obtain a more nuanced estimate of the degree to which Alzheimer’s dementia cases are attributable to standard neuropathological indices. The present results suggest that pathological AD, specifically the threshold of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles used for the NIA-Reagan pathological diagnosis of AD, and other standard neuropathological indices account for fewer cases of Alzheimer’s dementia than previously estimated, conservatively around two-thirds of all Alzheimer’s dementia cases.2

This study has strengths and limitations. Strengths are that findings are based on a large cohort of participants who underwent detailed annual cognitive evaluations for up to 22 years, autopsy rates were very high, and 9 age-related neuropathologies were assessed. The study also has limitations. Perhaps the most important limitation is that the neuropathological indices used herein represent markers of common age-related diseases, but do not capture the full burden of the diseases they represent or subthreshold disease. Specifically, we describe the effects of specific neuropathological indices, but not other aspects of their complex biological disease processes. In addition, the analyses were based on dichotomous pathology variables in order to facilitate comparisons among the different neuropathologies; thus, these results do not inform on important differences in the severity of AD and other neuropathological processes. Other limitations are that there are additional and related pathological processes that we did not quantify and/or are as yet unknown and the precise classification of some neuropathologies may be unclear; for example, we classified CAA as a vascular pathology, but it may also be an indicator of amyloidopathy. Finally, our approach to estimating the number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases not driven by these neuropathological indices, though empirically derived, may be suboptimal. Future work in population-based studies is needed to better understand the precise impact of age-related neuropathologies on Alzheimer’s dementia.

FIGURE 1: This figure shows the burden of mixed pathologies in the aging brain. The bar chart in the lower left corner shows the frequencies of individual neuropathological indices investigated in this study. Connected black dots on the x-axis indicate the specific combination of neuropathology represented (top 59 combinations shown). Histograms in the main panel show the frequencies of the neuropathological indices for persons with and without Alzheimer’s dementia proximate to death (present = blue versus absent = black), ordered by their frequency. The height of each bar corresponds to the number of persons with each combination. As illustrated in the figure, neuropathological indices frequently co-occur and the most common are (1) pathological AD only, (2) pathological AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, (3) macroscopic infarcts only, (4) pathological AD and Lewy bodies, and (5) pathological AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and TDP-43 pathology. AD = Alzheimer’s disease; CAA = cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Athero = atheroslerosis; LB = lewy body pathology; HS = hippocampal sclerosis; TDP-43 = transactive response DNA-binding protein 43.

FIGURE 2: This figure compares the areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves under different models. The red curve shows the estimated ROC for the model with demographics only; the green curve for the model with demographic and pathological AD; the blue curve for the model with demographic, pathological AD, and other 7 neuropathological indices; and the black curve for the model with demographics, all 8 neuropathologic indices, as well as an empirically derived indicator adjusting for Alzheimer’s dementia not accounted for by these neuropathological indices.

FIGURE 3: This figure illustrates the empirical approach of identifying individuals whose cognitive decline is not driven by the neuropathological indices studied here. Light gray lines represent model-estimated person-specific residual cognitive decline (ie, change in global cognition not explained by demographics and the 8 common neuropathological indices). The horizontal line represents the median global cognitive score at first AD diagnosis for all incident Alzheimer’s dementia cases (global cognitive score = −1.09). Individuals whose residual decline crossed this threshold were identified as Alzheimer’s dementia cases not accounted for by the 8 neuropathological indices.
