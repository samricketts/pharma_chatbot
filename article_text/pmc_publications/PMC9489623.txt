Background

We examined whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model was associated with changes in the receipt of joint replacement among people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) as well as spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcomes among people with ADRD who underwent a joint replacement surgery.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study using 2013–2017 Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set. We used a difference-in-differences analysis to compare people with ADRD residing in CJR-participating treatment areas versus non-participating control areas on the receipt of joint replacement, episode spending during the index hospitalization and subsequent 90-day post-discharge period, discharges to an institutional post-acute care setting, and readmissions within 90 days of hospital discharge.

Results

Our sample included 3,361,950 Medicare enrollees with ADRD (2,156,995 women [64%]; mean [SD] age, 83 [8.0] years; 2,646,405 White [78%], 344,478 Black [10%], 224,010 Hispanic [7%]). The receipt of replacement among people with ADRD changed similarly between CJR-participating treatment and control areas after CJR model was implemented, suggesting no association of CJR model with the receipt of replacement. Among people with ADRD who received joint replacement, the CJR model was associated with a $1,029 decrease in spending per episode (95% confidence interval [CI] − $1,577, −$481, p &lt; 0.001), a 1.62 percentage point decrease in discharges to an institutional post-acute care setting (95% CI −3.17, −0.07, p = 0.04), but no changes in 90-day readmission (95% CI −2.68, 0.00, p = 0.051).

Conclusions

Despite concerns that the CJR model could hinder people with ADRD from receiving joint replacement, the receipt of joint replacement did not change among people with ADRD under CJR. The CJR model was associated with decreased spending for people with ADRD who received joint replacements, driven by reduced discharges to an institutional post-acute care setting, without any changes in 90-day readmission.

Medicare bundled payment model
joint replacement

pmcINTRODUCTION

About 6 million Americans had Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) in 2020 and the number is projected to increase to 14 million by 2060.1,2 People with ADRD experience declines in cognition and physical functioning and can present care delivery challenges, particularly around invasive surgical procedures. As Medicare introduces value-based payment models designed to improve the quality of surgical care and subsequent rehabilitation, understanding the effects of these changes on this medically complex population is critical.

The Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, Medicare’s mandatory bundled payment model for joint replacements, may have significantly affected persons with ADRD. In April 2016, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented the CJR model in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas and most hospitals in those metropolitan statistical areas were required to participate. The CJR model set a quality-adjusted spending benchmark for each hospital’s joint replacement episode, defined as the index hospitalization and 90-day post-discharge care. If a hospital’s actual spending is below the benchmark, the hospital receives a bonus. Otherwise, they pay a penalty. Until October 2021, CJR did not adjust for patient comorbidities (other than the presence of a hip fracture or major complications during the index hospitalization) when setting the spending benchmark for each hospital.3 Therefore, CJR could have encouraged hospitals to avoid providing costlier patients —such as those with ADRD — with joint replacements.

Hip fracture and severe arthritis are common among people with ADRD.4,5 People with ADRD typically have more risk factors for hip fracture (e.g., gait impairment, osteoporosis, and depression) and the incidence of hip fracture is 2–3 times higher for patients with ADRD.5,6 Many Medicare enrollees with ADRD receive joint replacement each year, representing about 7% of all joint replacements paid by Medicare’s fee-for-service program. The majority (63%) of these procedures occur after hip fracture, with 37% being elective, while the hip-fracture percentage for people without ADRD is lower (11% hip-fracture vs. 89% elective).

Evidence suggests that joint replacements can still be beneficial for people with ADRD.7 However, people with ADRD can present additional challenges to care delivery. People with ADRD are at greater risk for delirium after surgery, which results in slow recovery and longer hospital stays.8,9 People with ADRD are also more likely to experience complications after joint replacements.10,11 Furthermore, rehabilitation can be difficult due to cognitive impairment.12,13 These challenges can lead to higher spending for joint replacements and following recovery among people with ADRD. Based on our data, spending on joint replacement surgery and 90-day rehabilitation for people with ADRD was about 10–16% higher than for the general patient population.14

Due to anticipated higher spending, the CJR model may have discouraged hospitals from providing not only elective joint replacement but also post-hip-fracture joint replacement for people with ADRD. Hospitals rarely refuse or delay joint replacements for patients with a hip fracture because replacement surgery is generally considered the best treatment option following hip fracture.15,16 However, people with ADRD are sometimes an exception and may receive palliative care after hip fracture instead of surgical repair.7

The CJR model may have also influenced post-surgical care for people with ADRD. Prior studies concluded that among the general patient population, CJR was associated with an increased percentage of people who went home after surgery, instead of being discharged to an institutional post-acute care setting. On average, despite receiving less intense post-acute care, postsurgical outcomes remained the same.14,17–20 The CJR model may have similar implications for people with ADRD. For example, hospitals may steer patients with ADRD from expensive institutional post-acute settings to home-based care. At the same time, however, patients with ADRD may obtain similar postsurgical outcomes if hospitals successfully improve care coordination.

Using the complete set of 2013–2017 Medicare claims and Minimum Data Set, we evaluated whether the CJR model was associated with the receipt of joint replacements in Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Among those who received a joint replacement, we also assessed the association of the CJR model with spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcomes. Our study provides critical information about the impact of Medicare value-based payment reforms on care for people with ADRD.

METHODS

Study Settings

Our study included 67 treatment metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) randomly selected for CJR participation and 103 control MSAs eligible but not selected for CJR participation (Supplementary Section S1).21

Data Sources

We used the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File - Chronic Conditions and Other Chronic Conditions files to identify people with ADRD and their chronic health conditions and the Master Beneficiary Summary File - Base to obtain their demographic characteristics. Medicare inpatient, outpatient, carrier, home health agency, hospice, and skilled nursing facility claims were used to identify the receipt of joint replacement as well as any associated spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcomes. We used the Long-Term Care Minimum Data Set 3.0 to identify individuals whose primary residence was a nursing facility and to obtain cognitive and functional impairment status for individuals who were discharged to a short-term skilled nursing facility for rehabilitation. Finally, we used the Area Health Resource Files to obtain MSA characteristics.22 All datasets were from year 2013–2017.

Sample Selection

Our sample included all Medicare enrollees diagnosed with ADRD. We identified people with ADRD using Chronic Condition Warehouse algorithm criteria for ADRD or senile dementia.23 The algorithm searches all claims with three-year lookback periods for specific sets of ICD-9/10 codes. We further limited our sample to those who resided in the 67 CJR-participating and 103 control MSAs from January 2013 through June 2015 (pre-CJR) or April 2016 through September 2017 (post-CJR; CJR model began in April 2016). We excluded July 2015 (when the CJR model was first officially announced) through March 2016 from our analysis as a washout period. For each quarter, we excluded enrollees who were younger than 66 years old, moved out of their MSA, died within the quarter, or were not continuously enrolled in Medicare Part A and B (Supplementary Table S1).

Primary Outcomes

We used four primary outcomes for this study, including the receipt of joint replacement (elective and post-hip-fracture replacements), total spending, discharges to institutional post-acute care setting, and readmissions. The receipt of joint replacement was a binary variable indicating whether each enrollee received a knee or hip replacement in a given quarter (identified by the presence of inpatient claims with Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group or MS-DRG 469 and 470). Total spending was Medicare spending incurred during the episode of care (the index hospitalization and 90 days post-discharge) except durable equipment spending, adjusted for inflation and cost of living.24,25 We defined discharges to institutional post-acute care as whether an enrollee was discharged to a skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation facility, long-term care hospital, or swing bed. Finally, we defined readmissions as the occurrence of any readmissions relevant to joint replacements (as defined by CMS) within 90-days after the initial hospital discharge.26,27 We measured the last three primary outcomes only among enrollees who had a joint replacement (Supplementary Table S2).

Secondary Outcomes

We measured secondary outcomes among enrollees who had a joint replacement. They included spending incurred at different care settings, length of institutional post-acute care setting stay (days), discharges to home (with or without home health visits), 90-day hospice use, 90-day emergency department use, 90-day all-cause mortality, and functional status improvement among people who were discharged to a skilled nursing facility.28 Functional status improvement was defined as the difference in activities of daily living score between admission to and 90-days or discharge from a skilled nursing facility, and was on scale of 0–28 (Supplementary Table S2).

Statistical Analysis

We assessed whether the CJR model was associated with changes in the receipt of joint replacements by estimating a difference-in-differences linear regression model. The unit of analysis was person-quarter (i.e., we measured each person’s receipt of joint replacement each quarter). The primary independent variable was the interaction between a binary measure of enrollee residence (CJR MSA vs. control MSA) and a binary measure of time (quarter occurred during pre- vs. post-CJR). The coefficient for the interaction term represented the change in the receipt of joint replacement associated with CJR. Other explanatory variables included age, sex, race/ethnicity, dual enrollment status in Medicare and Medicaid, 65 chronic health conditions, nursing home residence status, years from first ADRD diagnosis, and MSA characteristics. We also included MSA fixed effects to account for time-invariant MSA characteristics and quarter fixed effects to account for any secular trends in the outcome. See Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Section S2 for details on explanatory variables and our analytic model, respectively.

Among people with ADRD who received a joint replacement, we assessed whether the CJR model was associated with changes in spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcomes using a difference-in-differences linear regression model. Here, the unit of analysis was each joint replacement episode of care (index hospitalization and 90-day post-discharge period). The primary independent variable was an interaction term between a binary measure of hospital location (CJR MSA vs. control MSA) and a binary measure of time (pre- vs. post-CJR period). The coefficient of the interaction term represented the change in spending, health service use, or postsurgical outcomes associated with CJR. In addition to explanatory variables listed above, we further adjusted for any major complications during the index hospitalization (a major complication was present if the surgery was billed with MS-DRG code 469, and no complications otherwise) and type of joint replacement (knee, elective hip, hip fracture). We included hospital fixed effects to account for time-invariant hospital characteristics.

We used linear models in all analyses for straightforward interpretation of interaction estimates. We also ran non-linear models, and the interpretation of findings did not change by choice of models. We applied Huber-White robust error corrections clustered at the MSA level in all analyses to account for correlated observations within each MSA and applied sampling weights to account for oversampling of high-cost MSAs during random treatment assignment (Supplementary Section S1). We found no statistically significant differences in time trends between CJR-participating and control MSAs during the pre-CJR period for any of our outcomes, supporting the pre-intervention parallel trends assumption (Supplementary Section S2).

We performed three sensitivity analyses. First, we assessed whether the CJR model was associated with changes in the receipt of each type of joint replacement (elective knee, elective hip, or hip fracture replacement surgery). Second, to assess whether changes in the receipt of joint replacement were concentrated in people with more advanced functional or cognitive impairment, we limited our sample to nursing home residents (i.e., those who stayed in a nursing facility for 100+ days with no more than 10 consecutive days outside of a facility in the two quarters prior to joint replacement) and repeated our analysis for the receipt of joint replacement. We also further split nursing home residents by their cognitive and functional impairment status and repeated the same analyses.28,29 Third, we stratified our analyses for the association between CJR model and spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcomes by elective vs post-hip fracture joint replacement.

All statistical tests were 2-sided and statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. We used R 4.0.3 for all analyses.

RESULTS

Our sample included 23,215,914 person-quarters from 3,361,950 unique Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Compared to Medicare enrollees with ADRD in the control MSAs, those in the CJR MSAs were on average older (19.7% over 90 years old vs 18.8%), more likely to be Hispanic (9.7% vs 4.3%) or Asian/Pacific Islander (4.6% vs 2.5%), and more likely to have a full Medicaid coverage (35.1% vs 26.4%) (Supplementary Table S3).

Association of CJR model with the receipt of joint replacement among people with ADRD

Figure 1 displays the unadjusted receipt of joint replacements per 1,000 Medicare enrollees with ADRD across CJR and control MSAs between 2013 and 2017. At any given time, people with ADRD in control MSAs were consistently more likely to receive a joint replacement than those in CJR MSAs (3.1 vs 2.8 per 1,000 during the pre-CJR period and 3.2 vs 2.9 per 1,000 during the post-CJR period). The difference in the rate of joint replacements between the two groups did not appear to change following CJR implementation.

Table 1 presents the adjusted association of the CJR model with changes in the receipt of joint replacements per 1,000 Medicare enrollees with ADRD. We found no evidence for any changes in the receipt of joint replacements among Medicare enrollees with ADRD associated with CJR model (0.04 replacements per 1,000 person-quarters; 95% CI: −0.07 to 0.14, p = 0.51).

We also found no association of the CJR model with the receipt of different types of joint replacements (elective knee, elective hip, and post-fracture hip replacement) (Supplementary Table S4, Sensitivity Analysis 1). Nor did we find an association when restricting to nursing home residents and nursing home residents with severe cognitive/functional impairments, indicating that people with more advanced functional or cognitive impairment did not experience changes in the receipt of joint replacements under CJR model (Supplementary Table S4, Sensitivity Analysis 2).

Association of CJR model with spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcome among people with ADRD who received joint replacement

To measure the association between the CJR model and spending, health service use, and postsurgical outcomes among people with ADRD who received joint replacement, we restricted our sample to the 54,842 unique Medicare enrollees with ADRD who received a joint replacement surgery (Supplementary Table S5 and S6).

Figure 2 displays unadjusted total spending, discharges to institutional post-acute care setting, and 90-day readmissions among people with ADRD who received joint replacement. Spending for people in the CJR MSAs was slightly higher than for those in the control MSAs throughout the study period, but the difference decreased after CJR started ($33,253 vs $31,684 during the pre-CJR period and $32,137 vs $31,524 during the post-CJR period). Discharge to an institutional post-acute setting for rehabilitation was slightly more common in the CJR MSAs than in the control MSAs throughout the study period. However, once again the difference between CJR and control MSAs decreased after CJR was implemented (79.2% vs 77.1% during the pre-CJR period and 71.9% vs 70.8% during the post-CJR period). About 20% of people with ADRD were readmitted to a hospital within 90-day post-discharge period; we observed no clear patterns in 90-day readmissions between CJR and control MSAs after CJR implementation.

Table 2 shows the adjusted association of the CJR model with changes in total spending, discharges to institutional post-acute care setting, and 90-day readmissions among people with ADRD who received a joint replacement. The CJR model was associated with $1,029 reduction in total spending (95% CI: −$1,577 to −$481, p &lt; 0.001) and 1.62 percentage point reduction in discharges to institutional post-acute care setting (95% CI: −3.17 to −0.07, p = 0.04). We found no evidence for any changes in 90-day relevant readmission (95% CI: −2.68 to 0.00, p = 0.051).

When looking at secondary outcomes, the CJR model was associated with a $1,082 reduction in institutional post-acute care spending (95% CI: −$1,628 to −$536, p &lt; 0.001), driven by reduced skilled nursing facility spending (-$754, 95% CI: −$1,164 to −$345, p &lt; 0.001) (Table 3). CJR was also associated with a 1.79 day decrease of institutional post-acute care setting stay (95% CI: −2.89 to −0.70, p &lt; 0.001). Despite the reduced use in institutional post-acute care, CJR was not associated with any changes in mortality and emergency department visits. CJR was also not associated with any changes in functional status improvement (on scale 0–28) during people’s skilled nursing facility stay (−0.23, 95% CI: −0.47 to 0.01, p = 0.07).

We also found that the CJR model was associated with a reduction in total spending, discharges to institutional post-acute care setting, and readmissions among people with ADRD who received elective hip or knee replacements, and a reduction in total spending, but no changes in discharges to institutional post-acute care setting among people with ADRD who received a joint replacement after hip fracture (Supplementary Table S4, Sensitivity Analysis 3).

DISCUSSION

Despite concerns that the CJR model may hinder people with ADRD from receiving a joint replacement, we found that the CJR model was not associated with changes in the receipt of joint replacements among people with ADRD. Given evidence that joint replacements can still be beneficial for people with ADRD,7 it is reassuring that receipt of joint replacements for Medicare enrollees with ADRD did not decrease under CJR. Consistent with our finding, one study found that CJR did not lead hospitals to decrease admission of high-risk patients for joint replacement, although the definition of high-risk patients in the previous studies was broad.14 Focusing on Medicare enrollees with an arthritis diagnosis, another study also found that CJR did not lead hospitals to selectively avoid elective joint replacement for people with ADRD.30

Our finding – no changes in the receipt of joint replacement under CJR among people with ADRD – may be potentially because hospitals instead successfully reduced spending for these medically complex patients. The CJR model was associated with a $1,029 reduction in total spending for people with ADRD (3.1% reduction from total spending in the pre-CJR period). While statistically significant, the size of savings was relatively modest. However, other studies also found modest savings among the general patient population under CJR ($997-$1,084).14,31 Reduction in total spending among people with ADRD was mostly driven by fewer discharges to institutional post-acute care setting. Particularly, reduction in institutional post-acute care use was concentrated among people with ADRD who underwent elective hip or knee replacements. This indicates that hospitals targeted patients who received elective joint replacement to save costs, rather than patients with post-hip-fracture replacement surgery who are often frail and need more intensive post-acute care for recovery.

Despite the reduced spending and discharge to institutional post-acute care among people with ADRD, we found no evidence that postsurgical outcomes changed under CJR model. While not statistically significant, one of postsurgical outcomes – functional status improvement during people’s skilled nursing facility stay – was negatively associated with CJR model, indicating that people’s functional status improved less while they were recovering in a skilled nursing facility. This could be concerning given the shorter stay in a skilled nursing facility, but the size of change (−0.23, 95% CI: −0.47 to 0.01, p = 0.07) was minimal and not clinically meaningful given functional status improvement was measured on 0–28 scale. All together, overall changes under CJR model – reduced spending and discharge to institutional post-acute care along with no changes in postsurgical outcomes – could be viewed as improvement for people with ADRD who received joint replacement.

However, the positive changes under the CJR model may have negatively affected informal caregivers of people with ADRD. For example, the overall reduction in the discharge to institutional post-acute care under CJR may have increased caregiving burden for informal caregivers of people with ADRD. Most people with ADRD residing in their home receive a substantial amount of help from informal caregivers (about 100 hours per month).32 The intensity and complexity of this informal care may have further increased if more people with ADRD recover after joint replacement at home because people with ADRD often have extreme difficulty following guidelines for recovery.13 Future research is needed to assess whether the CJR model increased caregiving burden of informal caregivers of people with ADRD who receive joint replacement.

This study had limitations. First, we identified people with ADRD using Chronic Condition Warehouse algorithm criteria for ADRD or senile dementia, but this approach may identify a limited proportion of people with ADRD.33 Therefore, our results are valid only for people diagnosed with ADRD. Second, we measured receipt of joint replacement among all Medicare enrollees with ADRD. An ideal approach would be to only measure receipt among people who had clinical needs for joint replacement, but claims data do not sufficiently capture the clinical indicators required to identify this population. Third, informal caregivers may play a critical role for people with ADRD regarding their decision on the receipt of joint replacement and recovery after the surgery. However, we could not consider informal caregivers in our analyses because claims do not include information on informal caregivers. Fourth, the analysis of joint replacement spending, health service use, and outcomes included only hospitals eligible for CJR model participation, and therefore its results may not be generalizable to all patients who received joint replacement in the United States.

Understanding the effect of CJR on care among people with ADRD is critical. Our study found that despite CJR model’s financial pressure, hospitals did not limit joint replacement for people with ADRD. The CJR model was also successfully able to reduce total spending of care for people with ADRD who received joint replacement without changing their postsurgical outcomes. Together, these results could be viewed as improvement for people with ADRD under the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model.

Abbreviation: CJR is Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement

a Unadjusted estimates

b Adjusted estimates. The model adjusted for an interaction term between a binary measure of hospital location (CJR MSA vs. control MSA) and a binary measure of time (pre- vs. post-CJR period), age, sex, race/ethnicity, dual enrollment status in Medicare and Medicaid, 65 chronic health conditions, nursing home residence status, years from first ADRD diagnosis, any major complications during the index hospitalization (MS-DRG codes 469 vs. 470), type of joint replacement (knee, elective hip, hip fracture), MSA characteristics, hospital fixed effects, and quarter fixed effects.

c The difference in outcomes between post- and pre-CJR period.

Key points

Despite the concern that the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model could result in hospitals avoiding medically complex patients for joint replacement, the receipt of joint replacement did not change among people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias under the model.

The Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model was associated with reduced total spending among patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias who underwent joint replacement surgery. The reduction in total spending was mostly driven by reduced discharges to an institutional post-acute care setting. However, the model was not associated with worsened postsurgical outcomes.

Why does this paper matter?

Despite concerns that the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model could hinder people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) from receiving joint replacements, we found that the receipt of joint replacement did not change among people with ADRD under the model. Further, the model was associated with decreased spending for patients with ADRD who underwent joint replacement surgery without increases in 90-day readmission. Together, these results could be viewed as improvement for people with ADRD under the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model.
