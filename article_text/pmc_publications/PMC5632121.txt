Background and Purpose

Traditional neuroimaging markers of small vessel disease focus on late-stage changes. We aimed to adapt a method of venular assessment at 7Tesla for use in older adults. We hypothesized that poorer venular morphological characteristics would be related to other small vessel disease neuroimaging markers and higher prevalence of small vessel disease-Alzheimer’s disease risk factors.

Materials and Methods

Venules were identified in periventricular regions of interest on SWI and defined as tortuous or straight. Tortuosity ratio was defined as total tortuous venular length divided by total straight venular length. WMH burden (visually rated from 0 to 3) and number of microbleeds (0, 1, &gt;1) were determined. Differences in tortuous and straight venular lengths were evaluated. Relationships with demographic variables, APOE4, growth factors, pulse pressure, physical activity, and Modified Mini-Mental State examination were assessed via Spearman correlations.

Results

Participants had 42% more tortuous venular tissue than straight (median [95% CI]: 1.42 [1.13, 1.62]). APOE4 presence was associated with greater tortuosity ratio (rho=0.454, p=0.001), and these results were robust to adjustment for confounders and multiple comparisons. Associations of tortuosity ratio with sex and vascular endothelial growth factor did not survive adjustment. Associations of tortuosity ratio with other variables of interest were not significant.

Conclusion

Morphological measures of venules at 7T could be useful biomarkers of early stages of small vessel disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Longitudinal studies should examine the impact of APOE and VEGF on risk of venular damage.


INTRODUCTION

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) increases dementia risk1 and vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology.2 Neuroimaging methods investigating SVD have traditionally relied on WM hyperintensities (WMH). However, WMH is a marker of late-stage SVD, reflecting advanced parenchymal damage, reduced CBF, and abnormalities of the small penetrating vessels.3 Thus, there is a need for radiological markers that capture the earlier stages of SVD relating directly to vessel health.

With aging and hypertension, arteries have reduced ability to absorb flow pulsatility, thus transmitting highly pulsatile flow to the venules. Venular walls are well equipped to handle low pulsatile and slow flow, but not highly pulsatile flow. Pulsatility-related damage can induce venular morphological changes such as collagenosis, leading to loss of elasticity and lumen narrowing/occlusion, which in turn promote ischemia. Both collagenosis and tortuosity lead to reduced CBF and increased upstream resistance, exacerbating arterial pathology. Extravasation and inflammatory response, including focal perivascular parenchymal infiltration, can also occur facilitated by the lack of tight junctions on the venous side circulation.4 Inflammatory cascades further damage the vasculature, reduce CBF, and compromise the BBB. These phenomena can become apparent as morphological changes such as tortuosity, collagenosis, and thicker basal lamina. Such changes have been seen in vivo in AD,5 and in postmortem studies appear more common with older age and in proximity to regions with WMH.6–8 Although the possibility has not been tested directly, venular morphologic alterations are considered to precede radiologically overt WMH.

Ultra-high field (7Tesla) MRI has emerged as a non-invasive method to visualize venous microcirculation.9,10 Specifically, SWI exploits the paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin to visualize venules without a contrast agent. Methods to quantify venules in multiple sclerosis,11 sickle cell anemia,12 CADASIL,7,13 and recently AD14 have been reported. However, venular characteristics in relation to cerebral SVD in aging are unknown.

Our primary aim was to demonstrate the feasibility of adapting published methods11,12 to study venular characteristics in older adults. Our secondary aim was to evaluate relationships of venular characteristics with neuroimaging markers of SVD—WMH and microbleeds—and variables relevant to SVD and AD. We hypothesized that poorer venular morphological characteristics would be related to other SVD neuroimaging markers and higher prevalence of SVD-AD risk factors.

METHODS

Participants

The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders MRI study (LIFE MRI) is a neuroimaging study within a randomized controlled trial, which demonstrated that physical activity prevents major mobility disability in at-risk community-dwelling older adults vs. health education control (hazard ratio, 0.82, p=0.03).15 The study protocol was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written informed consent. The present study (N=53) uses images from the baseline visit.

The LIFE study design was previously reported.16 Supplemental Table 1 shows inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were not screened for MRI based on caffeine use due to minimal reported average caffeine-related signal change of veins in white matter (−2±1.2%).17. Supplemental Figure 1 shows participant flow.

Sample characteristics

Age, race, and sex, self-reported by participants, were evaluated because of their association with SVD and AD.18–22 Apolipoprotein E (APOE) was genotyped using TaqMan (TaqMan probe C__904973_10, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, CA) and Pyrosequencing.23 APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.24 Pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure-diastolic blood pressure (average of two seated measurements)) and physical activity were assessed because of their associations with AD25,26 and SVD.27,28 Physical activity was measured for seven days using hip-worn accelerometry (GT3X, Actigraph, LLC) as minutes per day of moderate physical activity. Finally, Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS)29 was included as a measure of global cognition.

Growth factors

The angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)30 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)31 were measured via the Luminex system using kits (Human Cancer Panel and  Neurodegenerative Disease Panel, EMD Millipore, Hercules, CA). Fasting blood, collected by venipuncture, remained at room temperature for 30–60 minutes to clot, and was then centrifuged at 1600×g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Serum was aliquoted and immediately frozen at ≤−70°C and stored until analysis. Concentrations were determined with two sets of standard curves, with final values calculated according to standardized procedures we have validated.32

Potential Confounders

Self-reported antihypertensive medication use, which may affect pulse pressure, was recorded. Blood hemoglobin was measured as it may affect venular conspicuity on SWI. We also recorded SWI voxel size, which varied among the participants.

Outcome Variables

Venular characteristics

Axial SWI MRIs were obtained at the University of Pittsburgh MR Research Center by using a Rapid Biomedical (Rimpar, Germany) 8-channel head coil on a Siemens (Erlangen, Germany) 7T scanner ((TR = 2000 ms, TE = 15 ms), acquired with 0.25 × 0.25 × 1.50 mm (n = 40), 0.23 × 0.23 × 3.00 mm voxels, interleave gap = 0.60 mm (n = 12), or with 0.50 × 0.50 × 1.00 mm voxels (n = 5). When necessary, scans were resampled to 1.50-mm section thickness.

A 4×1cm ROI was placed in each hemisphere, one slice below the uppermost slice on which ventricular CSF was visible. To maintain consistency, the ROI was placed based on native-space landmarks, centered along the anterior-posterior length of the ventricle, and placed on the ventricle’s lateral wall (Supplemental Figure 2). The ROI was chosen because it corresponds to regions known to be vulnerable to SVD,5,13,14 is consistent with published methods,11,12 and allows for the greatest consistency in vessel orientation, with a clear course perpendicular to the length of the lateral ventricles. The minimum intensity projection (MinIP) was applied over three slices (4.5 mm) to improve visualization.9

Three raters (CES, DRJ, NAM), were trained and overseen by a certified neuroradiologist (JM) and the study PI (CR). First, published protocols were studied and discussed among the raters, neuroradiologist, PI, and coinvestigators (HJA, RLM). Next, the same 5 MRIs were rated by the raters, each blinded to the tracings of the other 2 raters. Last, each venular tracing was discussed among the raters and with the neuroradiologist and Principal Investigator regarding the presence/absence of the venule and straight/tortuous course. This discussion continued until the raters were proficient in tracing and the results of their consensus were consistent with the judgment of the neuroradiologist/PI. Tracing was done using OSIRIX.33 Criteria to identify a venule were: a linear structure of intensity darker than the surrounding parenchyma; length ≥3 mm; and coursing through the ROI for ≥ 3mm (to reduce inter-rater variability of inclusion for vessels along the edge of the ROI). Most venules could be followed to obvious deep veins, and the dark appearance and orientation axial to the ventricles and deep within the WM also helped to identify the origin of the vessels as venous. Venules were traced across their full length, even if they continued outside of the ROI, to avoid artificial truncation. After all venules were traced, presence/absence of a venule was adjudicated by consensus among raters. A venule was included only if ≥2 of the three raters had traced it (Figure 1). Next, venular course (straight/tortuous) was rated during the consensus meeting. A vessel that ran free of inflexion points ≥30° for the majority of its total length (&gt; 60%) was defined “straight”; otherwise the vessel was defined “tortuous”. The length of each venule was computed as the median value of the lengths measured by the raters tracing that venule. Number and length of all consensus-traced venules were summed and total length and average length (total length/venule number) obtained for each participant. Tortuous venules are present in areas with WMH,6 thus we evaluated tortuous and straight venules separately. Tortuosity ratio was calculated as total tortuous length divided by total straight length. Thus, a tortuosity ratio&gt;1 indicates greater tortuous venular length than straight length. Due to BOLD-related signal blooming, measures of diameter may not be accurate, thus we did not quantify diameter.

White matter hyperintensities

WMH was imaged using T2WI (TR=12500 ms; TE=55 ms; voxel size=0.5×0.5×6.0 mm) and MPRAGE (TR=3430 ms; TE=3.54 ms; voxel size=0.7mm3 isotropic) and rated by consensus of two raters (CR, HJA) using a 0–3 modified Fazekas rating scale.34 Ratings consisted of the following: 0=none: no punctate hyperintense areas or periventricular rims; 1=mild: few punctate hyperintense areas and/or limited amount of hyperintense rims around the ventricular horns; 2= moderate: multiple punctate hyperintense areas and/or larger rims around the ventricular horns; or 3=severe: confluent subcortical hyperintense areas and/or rims all around the ventricles, including horns and sides. Only 4/53 had no WMH (WMH=0), leaving 92% with at least mild WMH; thus, we combined 0 and 1 to create a “none/mild” category. Because the distinction between periventricular and deep WMH is not consistently meaningful, we did not differentiate between them.35

Microbleeds

We classified cerebral microbleeds based on Greenberg, et al.36 Two trained raters (NAM, ELT) characterized microbleeds under the supervision of a neuroradiologist (JM). Microbleeds were defined as: black or substantially hypointense on SWI; round or ovoid (confirmed on adjacent slices); and at least half surrounded by brain parenchyma. To take advantage of the 7T magnet’s ability to capture quite small microbleeds, no minimum size criterion was used. Final ratings were based on consensus with disagreements mediated by the neuroradiologist. We counted total number of microbleeds across all 64 slices of the axial SWI and categorized totals as 0, 1, or &gt;1 microbleed.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated as counts and percentages, means and standard deviations (SD), or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR). Differences were tested with t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, or chi-square tests, α=0.05. We also determined the median tortuosity ratio and calculated the 95% CI using 10,000 bootstrapped samples.

We explored relationships of tortuosity ratio with other neuroimaging markers of SVD including WMH and microbleeds; non-modifiable factors including demographic variables (age, race, and sex) and APOE4; potentially modifiable factors including growth factors (VEGF and BDNF), pulse pressure (adjusted for antihypertensive medication use), and physical activity; 3MS; and hemoglobin, with Spearman correlations, α=0.10. Significant correlations with tortuosity ratio were re-evaluated as partial correlations adjusted for hemoglobin and voxel size. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.10 was used to correct for multiple comparisons.

Statistical analysis was performed in SAS version 9.437 and SPSS version 22.38

RESULTS

MRI study participants were younger and less likely to be non-Hispanic white than the non-MRI study participants (Table 1). Of MRI study participants, 15/47 with APOE data had at least one copy of the APOE4 allele. Thus, representation of APOE4 was higher than the 14% estimate among controls worldwide,39 but did not differ significantly from non-MRI participants. No or mild WMH were seen in 58.5% of participants while 20.8% each had moderate and severe WMH. Regarding microbleeds, 39.6% of the sample had 0, 20.8% had 1, and 24.5% had &gt;1.

Total length of tortuous vessels ranged from 26.25–246.36 mm, while total straight length ranged from 16.72–217.65 mm. Overall length of tortuous venules was greater than that of straight venules (Table 2). Total tortuous length was 42% greater than total straight length (median tortuosity ratio [95% bootstrapped CI]: 1.42 [1.13, 1.62]); (Supplemental Figure 3). To examine whether this finding was due to number of venules or average length, we evaluated differences in those measures. Total number of tortuous venules ranged from 4–32, while total straight venules ranged from 2–24. There were more tortuous venules than straight venules. The range of average tortuous length was 6.56–10.93 mm while the range of average straight length was 4.35–11.57 mm, and these average lengths were not significantly different. Thus, the difference in total tortuous and straight venular lengths was driven by greater numbers of tortuous venules.

Correlations between neuroimaging markers of SVD and tortuosity ratio were not significant. WMH correlated at rho= −0.125, p=0.37 and microbleeds correlated at rho= −0.059, p=0.70.

Among non-modifiable variables associated with AD and SVD, sex was associated with tortuosity ratio (Table 3). Males had a higher tortuosity ratio (median (IQR), 2.15 (0.98)) than females (median (IQR), 1.31 (0.71)). Those with at least one copy of the APOE4 allele had a higher tortuosity ratio (median (IQR), 2.15 (1.78)) than those without (median (IQR), 1.21 (0.75)). Associations with age and race were not significant (p&gt;0.10).

Among modifiable factors potentially influencing venular characteristics, higher VEGF was associated with lower tortuosity ratio. There were no significant associations with BDNF, pulse pressure (adjusted for antihypertensive use), physical activity, or 3MS score (p&gt;0.10). Results were similar when using a ratio of vessel counts instead of the ratio of total lengths.

The relationship of APOE4 with venular tortuosity, but not the other findings, remained significant after FDR correction of the p-value (p=0.01). Further adjustment for hemoglobin and voxel size did not modify the association with APOE4.

DISCUSSION

We found that application of 7T SWI is feasible to image cerebral venular characteristics in vivo in older adults. This method is a novel way to visualize an understudied component of the cerebral vasculature. Given associations of venular tortuosity with SVD6 and AD,40,41 as well as increases in microvascular changes with age,8 venular tortuosity may serve as a marker of declining cerebrovascular integrity. This method may afford earlier detection of SVD and has the advantage of characterizing venular morphology without contrast.

We also found that APOE4 was associated with higher tortuosity ratio, and this association was robust to adjustment for potential confounders and multiple comparisons. This result supports studies implicating APOE4 in reduced vascular integrity. APOE4 protein can directly damage the vasculature.42 APOE is associated with neuroimaging manifestations of SVD,43,44 and there are indications that it is associated with microvascular changes. Mice expressing transgenic human APOE4 have altered basement membrane protein expression.45 In humans with AD, APOE4 is associated with BBB disruption.46 APOE4 is associated with both increased deposition and reduced clearance of aβ.42 Clearly, APOE4 is central to development of AD pathology, and our results suggest it could be implicated in venular damage. It is possible that aβ deposition induces venular damage. An AD mouse model showed that as aβ built up in the arterioles beginning at 5 months of age, venular mural cells were damaged by 7 months of age.41 However, it is also possible that venular damage induces aβ deposition. In this same experimental model, further venular mural cell damage led to increased arteriolar aβ deposition, and interestingly, induction of venular tortuosity.41 Temporality of venular damage and aβ deposition remains an open question. We were unable to collect amyloid imaging. Hence, future multimodal neuroimaging studies need to evaluate timing and relationship of aβ burden and venular tortuosity.

Although our result is remarkably consistent with proposed APOE4-mediated reduction of vascular integrity,42 our study cannot clarify the underlying mechanism(s). This limitation notwithstanding, the fact that APOE4 is associated with venular tortuosity indicates the potential for risk stratification as an intervention strategy. Thus, other factors should be evaluated to offset APOE4-related risk.

We found a non-significant association of tortuosity ratio with WMH and microbleeds, which could be due to lack of sensitivity in our visual ratings or the small sample size. Future larger studies should evaluate associations of tortuosity ratio with WMH volume, a more sensitive measure as compared to visual ratings. Alternatively, this lack of association may indicate that tortuosity ratio is capturing novel, early information regarding vascular integrity. Future work should examine relationships of tortuosity ratio with other SVD neuroimaging markers and related cognitive and mobility impairment and clarify temporal order of venular damage and other SVD neuroimaging manifestations. We predict that venular damage comes before traditional neuroimaging markers of SVD.

Our study has several limitations. The sample was not selected to have particularly low or high SVD burden. Future studies should compare venular tortuosity ratio in those two groups. Larger samples will be needed to confirm associations with sex and VEGF. The venular measures are also two-dimensional, and therefore do not account for venules running out of the plane. However, this bias is non-differential across our sample. Finally, MRI participants were younger and had a higher proportion of non-whites indicating this sample may differ from the general community-dwelling older adult population.

Despite these limitations, our study has notable strengths. We applied ultra-high field neuroimaging with higher SNR than typically used to visualize novel venular characteristics. This allows for smaller sample sizes at ultra-high field than would be required at lower field strength. Because this neuroimaging study was also within a randomized controlled trial, these participants were extremely well-characterized, allowing us to control for potential confounding factors.

CONCLUSIONS

SWI at 7T offers a non-invasive method to image markers of cerebral venular integrity, and fills an important gap in knowledge. Morphological measures of venules at 7T could be useful biomarkers of early stages of SVD and AD. Risk and protective factors, especially those that are modifiable, for these pathophysiologic changes should be evaluated. Future longitudinal multimodal studies characterizing venular integrity at 7T are warranted.
