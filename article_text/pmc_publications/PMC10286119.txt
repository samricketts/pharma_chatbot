Objectives:

To assess whether older adults with a cognitive impairment were more likely to report challenges interacting with medical providers, or to avoid needed medical care.

Methods:

Data for this exploratory, cross-sectional analysis were from older adults (N = 493) ages 60–82 participating in the “LitCog” cohort study. Multivariable generalized linear models compared cognitive impairment (none, mild, moderate, severe) with validated measures of healthcare engagement.

Results:

A moderate cognitive impairment was associated with delays in medical care due to embarrassment (RR 5.34.95% CI 1.30–22.0) and discomfort asking the doctor questions (RR 4.07, 95% CI 1.00–16.5).

Conclusions:

Intermediate cognitive deficits, such as with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementias, may impact meaningful engagement with healthcare systems, potentially affecting timely detection and appropriate management of cognitive concerns and other chronic medical conditions. More research is needed to understand mechanisms underlying this relationship.

pmcIntroduction

Obtaining timely, appropriate medical care and engaging effectively with healthcare systems are essential components of maintaining health and independence among older adults, who are at increased risk of multimorbidity and disability (Salive, 2013). Yet, research has shown that as many as one-third of adults 65 and older report having delayed or avoided needed medical care (Federman et al., 2005; Kannan et al., 2014; Leyva et al., 2020). Consequences include missed or delayed diagnoses, increased risk and duration of hospitalization, worse physical and mental health, premature mortality, as well as higher healthcare costs (Byrne, 2008; Kraft et al., 2009; Ohl et al., 2010; Weissman et al., 1991). Various demographic, physical, psychological, and health-systems determinants have previously been linked to an increased risk of healthcare avoidance (Kannan et al., 2014; Leyva et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020). However, few studies have examined how changes in cognitive function, which are increasingly prevalent in older age and can range from normal age-related decline to progressive syndromes such as Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), may also be associated with barriers to recommended medical care.

A cognitive impairment, which includes deficits in one or more cognitive domains related to memory, executive function, language, attention, or processing speed, could undermine effective engagement with the healthcare system in several ways. For instance, many of the skills needed to effectively navigate healthcare systems and utilize healthcare services rely on cognitive abilities that may be compromised among those with a cognitive impairment (Lovett et al., 2020; Wolf et al., 2009). A cognitive deficit may therefore make it challenging for patients to understand or determine medical need, remember medical appointments and instructions, communicate effectively with clinicians and care teams, or problem-solve barriers to care. Furthermore, psychological aspects of disease, such as stigma or affective reactions to illness, including worry, fear, or shame related to diagnosis and/or losses in functional abilities or independence, are also common among individuals experiencing a cognitive impairment (Nguyen &amp; Li, 2020), and are known to interfere with important health-seeking behaviors (Dolezal, 2022).

While barriers and facilitators surrounding healthcare engagement specific to ADRD-related concerns or a subjective cognitive complaint have been well-documented in the literature (Hill et al., 2021; Werner et al., 2014), the impact of a cognitive impairment on general, versus disease-specific, aspects of care has not yet been studied. Older adults with a cognitive impairment must often contend with other acute and chronic medical conditions in addition to their cognitive symptoms. Indeed, an estimated 86% of adults with a cognitive impairment report the presence of at least one other chronic medical condition (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Consequences of this comorbidity are bi-directional; the presence of multiple chronic conditions is linked with poor or worsening cognitive health, while the presence of a cognitive deficit may also contribute to the subsequent development of additional chronic conditions (Snowden et al., 2017). Increasing understanding of how a cognitive impairment may impact management of health more globally, including health-seeking behaviors and interactions with medical providers or systems, is therefore both an important individual and public health concern. This is especially relevant as rates of cognitive impairment, including ADRD, are expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades as the demographic composition of the United States continues to grow older and more medically complex (Alzheimer’s Association [Alz Assoc], 2022).

The objective of this exploratory investigation was therefore to examine whether older adults with a cognitive impairment, as measured via objective assessment, were more likely to report challenges interacting with medical providers, or to avoid needed medical care altogether. Furthermore, we also sought to determine if attitudes regarding patient-provider engagement or prevalence of reported reasons underlying healthcare avoidance might differ according to severity of cognitive impairment. We hypothesized older adults with an objective cognitive impairment would endorse greater barriers to healthcare engagement compared to cognitively normal older adults, and rates would be greater as severity of cognitive impairment increased. Findings may improve understanding of how the presence of a cognitive impairment may impact older adults’ perceptions of and participation in medical care more broadly, and can help to inform patient-centered interventions to optimize healthcare engagement within this growing population.

Methods

Data for this cross-sectional, secondary analysis came from the ongoing, prospective Health Literacy and Cognitive Function among Older Adults cohort study (Wolf et al., 2012). LitCog is an observational cognitive aging study originally designed to investigate the relationship between health literacy, chronic disease self-management, and general cognitive abilities over time. Three study timepoints (T1–T3) have been completed, with an additional two timepoints currently underway (T4 and T5). Nine-hundred cognitively-intact older adults were recruited for baseline assessment between August 2008 and August 2015 using convenience sampling methods. English-speaking adults aged 55–74 receiving care at either one academic general internal medicine practice or six federally qualified health centers in Chicago, IL between August 2008 and August 2015 were identified through electronic health records as initially eligible by age, notified of the study by mail, and contacted via phone. Interested participants were further screened for any severe visual, hearing, or cognitive impairments (defined as ≤2 errors on the 6-item screener) (Callahan et al., 2002), that would significantly limit study participation. Participants completed a baseline assessment consisting of two structured interviews 7–10 days apart, each lasting 2.5 hr. Day 1 assessments included basic demographic information, socioeconomic status, comorbidity, health literacy, and assessments of chronic disease self-management. Day 2 interviews consisted of a comprehensive cognitive battery, detailed further below. Participants completing baseline assessment were invited to follow-up interviews every 3 years. Participants provided written informed consent at each study timepoint, and subsequent interviews followed similar procedures to baseline interviews, however, with additional measures added to the study battery at each timepoint. For this analysis, data from the third timepoint (T3, collected between August 11, 2014 and February 20, 2020) was used. T3 was selected as measures related to reasons underlying healthcare avoidance and attitudes towards patient-provider engagement were introduced into the study battery at this time, and all data collection activities have been completed for this timepoint. Out of the original 900 study participants, a total of 501 participants completed interviews at T3, representing a 56% retention rate. Cognitive testing data was missing for eight participants; thus, 493 participants were used for this analysis. The study was approved by the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (Approval Number: STU00026255-MOD0014).

Measures

Cognitive Impairment.

Cognitive impairment was our primary independent variable of interest. Thirteen cognitive tests were used to measure performance in five cognitive domains: processing speed (Digit Comparison, Pattern Comparison, Symbol Digit Modalities) (Salthouse, 1991, 1992; Smith, 1991), working memory (CANTAB Spatial Span Length—Reverse, CANTAB Spatial Working Memory, Size Judgment Span) (Cherry &amp; Park, 1993; Robbins et al., 1994), delayed memory (CANTAB Delayed Verbal Memory, New York Paragraph—Delayed) (Kluger et al., 1999; Robbins et al., 1994), executive function (ETS Letter Sets, CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge, Ravens Progressive Matrices) (Ekstrom &amp; Harman, 1976; Raven, 1976; Robbins et al., 1994), and language (CANTAB Graded Naming Test, Shipley Institute of Living—Vocabulary) (Robbins et al., 1994; Zachary, 1986). Determination of cognitive impairment within this sample has previously been described in detail (Lovett et al., 2020), and based on methods proposed by Shirk et al. (2011) for research purposes in which cognitive assessments have been adapted for practical use and/or when reliable norms are not available for a given population of interest. Briefly, individual age- and education-adjusted z-scores were calculated for each individual for each cognitive test using a modified regression-based approach, and recognizing participants were classified as having either mild (−1 to −1.49), moderate (−1.5 to −1.99), or severe (&lt;−2) impairment if their performance on two or more tests within at least one cognitive domain met these thresholds (with higher domain severities superseding lower domain severities). This classification is closely aligned to methods proposed by Jak/Bondi, in which both a cut-off score and number of impaired tests in a domain are considered to balance both sensitivity and specificity (Bondi et al., 2014).

For diagnostic comparison, mild to moderate severities loosely correspond to DSM-TR identified neuropsychological threshold of 1–2 standard deviations below appropriate norms for Minor Neurocognitive Disorder (NCD) (also known as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)) (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). Our severe classification most closely aligns with DSM-5-TR neuropsychological criteria (2 or more standard deviation below appropriate norms) for Major Neurocognitive Disorder (also known as ADRD).

Barriers to Healthcare Engagement.

Reasons for avoiding or delaying medical care were assessed using four items from the Access to Care Module of the validated Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer (ABC) measure (Simon et al., 2012). The ABC measure has previously been used to assess health-seeking behaviors among non-cancer populations (Jarbøl et al., 2021). All participants were provided the following prompt: “Sometimes people put off going to the doctor even when they have a symptom they think might be serious- …could you say if any of these might put you off going to the doctor?” Participants were then provided with four individual statements: “I would be too embarrassed,” “I would be worried about wasting the doctor’s time,” “I would be worried about what the doctor might find,” and “I am too busy to make time to go to the doctor.” Response options were the same for each item (Yes, often; Yes, sometimes; No), which were then dichotomized for the purposes of this analysis (Yes, often/Yes, sometimes vs. No).

Two individual items were also used to examine attitudes towards patient-provider interactions. Participants were first asked: “In general, how comfortable do you feel asking questions of doctors?” Original response options for this item (Not comfortable at all; A little comfortable; Somewhat comfortable; Very comfortable) were then dichotomized (Not comfortable at all/A little comfortable vs. Somewhat comfortable/Very comfortable). Participants were also asked: “In general, how nervous are you when you go to see the doctor?” Responses (Not nervous at all; A little nervous; Somewhat nervous; Very nervous) were also dichotomized (Very nervous/somewhat nervous vs. A little nervous/Not nervous at all).

Covariates.

As this was a secondary data analysis, covariate selection was based on a combination of the available data in addition to the prior literature. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and number of chronic medical conditions were collected via self-report. Health literacy was measured using the Newest Vital Signs (NVS) (Weiss et al., 2005). Scores range from 0–6, and performance was categorized as limited (&lt;2), marginal (&lt;4), or adequate (≥4) health literacy. Mental health symptoms were measured using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression and anxiety short-form subscales (Cella et al., 2010). All PROMIS tests have a mean of 50 (±10) by definition and are normed against the U.S. general population. Higher scores indicate more symptoms.

Analysis Plan

Differences between participant characteristics, cognitive impairment (none, mild, moderate, severe), and our outcomes of interest were first determined using a combination of chi-square tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Chi-square tests were then used to examine bivariate associations between cognitive impairment and barriers to healthcare engagement (reasons underlying healthcare avoidance, attitudes towards patient-provider interactions). Reasons underlying healthcare avoidance was assessed at both the item-level and overall (if any item was endorsed). Attitudes towards patient-provider interactions were examined only for each individual question item. Multivariable models using a Poisson distribution to estimate relative risk with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were then conducted for any bivariate associations found to be significant at the p &lt; 0.05 level (Zou, 2004), controlling for race/ethnicity, income, number of chronic medical conditions, health literacy, and mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety). Covariates were included in multivariable analyses if they were significant with either cognition or our outcomes of interest. Education was not included in models due to concern for over-adjustment; previous studies have recommended inclusion of either education or health literacy, but not both (Wolf et al., 2005). All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 15.1 (College Station, TX).

Results

Participant characteristics, overall and by cognitive impairment, are listed in Table 1. Participants were on average 68.6 (SD 5.2) years old. Over one-half (51.4%) of the sample were White. Approximately one-third (35.2%) had a graduate degree, and nearly one-half (47.7%) reported an income greater than $50,000. Participants had an average of 3.2 (SD 1.9) chronic conditions. Over one-half (51.3%) had adequate health literacy. Average PROMIS t-scores were 46.1 (SD 8.2) and 51.1 (SD) for depression and anxiety, respectively.

Approximately one-third of our sample demonstrated an objective cognitive impairment (29.2%) (Table 1). Of these, the majority were mild (16.4%), followed by moderate (6.9%) and then severe (5.9%). Participants with a cognitive impairment were more likely to be of a racial/ethnic minority, report lower educational attainment and income levels, and have a greater number of chronic medical conditions (all p’s &lt; 0.001). Those with a cognitive impairment were also more likely to have lower health literacy (p &lt; 0.001), as well as more depressive (p &lt; 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (p = 0.004).

In total, nearly half (41.0%) of older adults reported having delayed important medical care (Table 2). Of these, the majority reported delays due to worry about what the doctor might find (24.0%), followed by being too busy (16.5%), worry about wasting the doctor’s time (7.5%), and embarrassment (4.7%). Approximately 15% of our overall sample reported feeling nervous to go to the doctor; only a small proportion of adults overall endorsed discomfort asking the doctor questions (4.3%).

Bivariate associations between cognitive impairment and the outcomes of interest are also listed in Table 2. Associations between cognitive impairment and the combined avoidance score were non-significant. However, on item-level analysis differences by cognitive impairment severity were observed (Mild: 3.7% vs. Moderate: 23.5% vs. Severe: 3.5% vs. None: 3.2%, p &lt; 0.001). A cognitive impairment was also associated with higher rates of discomfort asking doctors questions (Mild: 7.4% vs. Moderate: 14.7% vs. Severe: 5.9% vs. None: 2.3%, p = 0.002). Rates of reported worry about what the doctor might find were in general higher for those with a cognitive impairment (Mild: 23.5% vs. Moderate: 38.2% vs. Severe: 27.6% vs. None: 22.5%), however, this association was not statistically significant. All other bivariate associations were non-significant.

In multivariable analysis (Table 3), compared to the group with no impairment and controlling for relevant covariates, only those with a moderate cognitive impairment remained more likely to endorse delaying medical care due to feelings of embarrassment (RR 5.34.95% CI 1.30–22.0). Independent associations between moderate cognitive impairment and discomfort asking the doctor questions were also observed (RR 4.07, 95% CI 1.00–16.5), and independent of observed associations with race and ethnicity (Black RR 5.30, 95% CI 1.25–22.5; Other RR 5.95, 95% CI 1.22–29.1). No significant associations were apparent among those with either mild or severe impairments in multivariable analysis.

Discussion

In this exploratory analysis among a sample of older, community-based adults, approximately four in 10 older adults reporting delaying needed medical care for reasons such as increased worry or embarrassment and/or due to time-constraints, regardless of cognitive status. Nearly a fifth of our sample reported feeling nervous or uncomfortable interacting with medical providers. Our findings also suggest that the presence of an objective cognitive impairment is independently associated with certain barriers (i.e., discomfort asking questions, feeling of embarrassment) to meaningful engagement in one’s medical care, above and beyond the influence of other known demographic and psychosocial factors. Furthermore, we also found that the degree of cognitive impairment may also be an important factor influencing such barriers. Specifically, those with a moderate cognitive impairment, likely corresponding to MCI or mild ADRD, were more likely to endorse these concerns when compared to adults without a cognitive impairment. No such relationship was observed for individuals with deficits categorized as either mild or severe.

The prevalence of older adults reporting delays in medical care in this study is somewhat higher than prior estimates in the literature, which have found rates range from 22–37% (Federman et al., 2005; Kannan et al., 2014; Leyva et al., 2020). This variability may be due to measurement differences; the items assessing healthcare avoidance from the ABC measure used in this study tended to be general in nature (e.g., “I would be worried about what the doctor might find.”) (Simon et al., 2012). Other studies assessing healthcare avoidance have often used Health Information Trends Survey Items, which has more specific terminology (e.g., “It makes me think about dying.”) (Kannan et al., 2014; Leyva et al., 2020). It should be noted that existing measurement tools for assessing avoidance of medical care, and barriers surrounding healthcare engagement more broadly, are often limited to a restricted number of items that may not comprehensively address factors associated with these concepts. To optimize understandings surrounding this important healthcare behavior within this population, future studies should be conducted to better operationalize this construct and develop more extensive, patient-centered, validated questionnaires to further improve this field of research.

Findings from this study also extend understanding surrounding determinants of certain barriers to healthcare engagement amongst older adult populations. Specifically, we found that individuals with a moderate, as opposed to mild or severe, cognitive impairment were more likely to report discomfort interacting with doctors or delay care due to embarrassment. This supports previous research conducted among the general population that psychological or emotional factors, both general and disease-specific, are often most predictive of poorer healthcare engagement (Kannan &amp; Veazie, 2014; Taber et al., 2015). When considered in the context of a cognitive impairment specifically, an ADRD diagnosis can be devastating for patients and their families. While symptoms can be managed or even delayed with early identification and supportive care, no cure currently exists, and affected adults often live through many years of disability and dependence as the disease progresses. As a result of this high disease burden, internalized stigma, shame, and illness fears have been found to be common among those with ADRD or other cognitive concerns (Fowler et al., 2012; Nguyen &amp; Li, 2020). Research in this area more broadly has shown stigmatized populations are more likely to report medical encounters as sources of shame and humiliation interfering with healthcare access (Dolezal, 2022), with commonly reported concerns including fears of judgment, disappointment, and blame (Northrop, 2017). Future research is needed to understand specific mechanisms underlying relationships between cognitive impairment and reduced healthcare engagement. While not a focus of this present study, it should also be noted other stigmatized populations endorsed discomfort interacting with medical professionals, specifically individuals who identified as a racial and ethnic minority. Racial disparities in patient-provider communication are well-established in the literature (Shen et al., 2018). Future studies should investigate how race and ethnicity moderates or confers an additive effect on the relationships between cognitive impairment and barriers to healthcare engagement.

The finding that moderate, versus mild or severe, cognitive impairments in our study, likely corresponding to intermediate stages of disease such as MCI or mild ADRD, were most associated poorer healthcare engagement, is also of particular interest. We expected that as severity of impairment increased so too would reported barriers to healthcare engagement, due to greater impact or consequences related to their symptoms. The severity effect observed here could be, in part, attributed to either presence or absence of insight or awareness related to their deficits. Theoretical models of healthcare delay posit that symptom appraisal is a necessary, but not sufficient, factor influencing action; that is, one must first perceive a symptom as being present prior to deciding to obtain treatment (Walter et al., 2012). At its most extreme end, lack of insight into one’s condition or its functional impact (i.e., “anosognosia”), is a common symptom of more severe impairments characteristic of ADRD (de Ruijter et al., 2020). Thus, as opposed to those classified as severe who may have lost awareness into their symptoms because of the disease process, participants with moderate impairments may still have been experiencing deficits that were impactful enough to be noticeable, but not yet significant enough to impair insight into these changes. The lack of association among those with milder impairments may also be due to the more subtle nature of their deficits, which may not have yet been significant enough to be perceived by the individual or detected by the healthcare system.

The possible consequences of underutilization of important healthcare services among individuals with a cognitive impairment are significant. Early detection and close management of chronic disease among the older adult population, in particular for progressive syndromes such as ADRD, are increasingly considered key to preventing or delaying further health declines, optimizing quality of life and preserving independence (Livingston et al., 2020). In time- and resource-constrained primary care settings where most older adults receive their medical care, identification and treatment typically relies on patient report. Yet, our findings suggest that many adults with a cognitive impairment may fail to report concerning signs or symptoms to medical providers or delay needed medical care, often for affective reasons such as discomfort or embarrassment, which may hinder formal detection or appropriate management of their cognitive conditions or other medical concerns. This may be particularly salient for older adults with more noticeable deficits that may have a larger impact on health self-management abilities, though may not yet be severe enough to have resulted in implementation of compensatory strategies or for caregivers to have assumed responsibility for these roles, which could further hasten health declines.

Previous research has demonstrated that increasing public health messaging and education surrounding cognitive impairment more broadly, and ADRD more specifically, may be one strategy to increase awareness and reduce both public, medical provider, and self/internalized stigma, which may have downstream effects on healthcare-seeking behavior (Herrmann et al., 2018). Medical providers should also be mindful that patients with a cognitive impairment may present with affective barriers impacting medical care engagement. Use of well-established patient-centered communication approaches, such rapport building, actively broaching sensitive topics, empathetic listening, and use of anecdotes, among other techniques, may help to further reduce and address these factors, when present (Storlie, 2015; National Institute on Aging, 2017). Identification and inclusion of care partners in the medical care and decision-making process for those with cognitive impairment is also known to promote greater healthcare engagement (Hill et al., 2021). Increasing uptake and use of reimbursable, person-centered assessment and care planning services, such as Medicare’s Annual Wellness Visit or the recently created CPT® coding for Cognitive Care Planning, may also help to facilitate symptom reporting among this at-risk population (Alz Assoc, 2016; Ganguli et al., 2017). Finally, emerging models of care based in primary care, including integrated, collaborative services that provide comprehensive, and ongoing education and counseling, care management and coordination, and personalized care plans have also shown promise in improving healthcare engagement and associated health outcomes (Boustani et al., 2019). Multi-faceted approaches combining individual, health system, and policy-level factors to optimize healthcare engagement within this population are likely needed.

Our study has several limitations which should be recognized. Foremost, our findings are limited to English-speaking, predominantly female, older adults who are connected to primary care practices in one urban city. However, the diversity of our sample regarding race/ethnicity should also be noted. Furthermore, this investigation was cross-sectional in nature, limiting interpretations regarding directionality and causality. Specifically, we are unable to determine if the presence of a cognitive impairment bestows an increased risk for avoiding needed medical care, or if increased barriers to healthcare engagement instead increases likelihood of developing a cognitive impairment. Our outcome measures addressing barriers to healthcare engagement were also reliant on self-report, which are frequently subject to recall or desirability biases, and limited to a restricted number of items that do not comprehensively address factors associated with this construct; as such, these measurement considerations likely limit a full understanding surrounding the prevalence of poor healthcare engagement and associated reasons within this population. Additionally, given the duration of data collection, changes in the healthcare environment or care practice models could have occurred over the course of the study period, potentially affecting access to care and interaction with healthcare providers. We also did not have proxy reports to compare with patient-endorsed outcomes, which limits our ability to confirm information accuracy, in particular for individuals with more severe impairments. Finally, as a secondary data analysis, this investigation was also limited by practical considerations including available measures and sample size. Specifically, the relatively small number of participants with a cognitive impairment in our sample, particularly those with moderate or severe deficits, likely affected our statistical power as well as the precision of any observed associations. A priori, longitudinal research studies utilizing larger samples, informant reporting, and comprehensive measurement of this construct are needed to help address these constraints.

In conclusion, the presence of a cognitive impairment negatively impacts adequate engagement in medical care through increased discomfort interacting with medical providers and feelings of embarrassment. Degree of cognitive impairment severity may also be an important consideration, with individuals demonstrating moderate cognitive deficits, likely characteristic of intermediate stages of disease such as MCI or mild ADRD, being more likely to report such barriers. Our findings underscore the need for multi-faceted, patient-centered solutions at the individual, health system, and policy-levels to help address affective factors such as stigma that may limit engagement with care. This exploratory analysis also highlights several directions for future research addressing this issue, in particular the need for further construct operationalization and measure development, investigations into the moderating or additive effect of other stigmatized identities, as well as longitudinal research to increase understanding of causality and mechanistic factors underlying the associations observed in this present study.

What this study adds

Cognitively-impaired older adults were more uncomfortable asking doctors questions and delayed medical care due to embarrassment.

Older adults with impairments of moderate severity, likely corresponding to MCI or mild dementia, were more likely to report these challenges.

Applications of study findings

Multi-faceted approaches are needed to enhance healthcare engagement in older adults with a cognitive impairment.
