Objective:

To identify subtypes of neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) course among cognitively normal individuals, and to assess the association between these subtypes and hazard of later MCI or dementia diagnosis.

Methods/Design:

We modeled neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores from 4,184 volunteers over approximately four years using growth mixture models, generating latent classes of trajectory. We then fit Cox proportional hazard models to determine if membership in trajectory classes was associated with increased hazard of diagnosis of MCI or dementia.

Results:

We identified four trajectory classes: the majority of the sample (65%) would be expected to belong to a class with consistently low or zero NPS. The next most prevalent class, (16%) showed a decrease over time in NPI-Q total score but, compared to the majority class had an almost 3-fold increase in hazard of MCI or dementia (HR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.82-4.68). Another class (14%) showed an increase in NPS over time, and was also associated with greater hazard of MCI or dementia (HR: 3.96; CI: 2.61-6.03). The smallest class (5%) had high and fluctuating NPI-Q total scores, and had the greatest hazard (HR: 4.57; CI: 2.72-7.63).

Conclusion:

We have demonstrated that is is possible to identify meaningful groups of NPS trajectories, and that trajectory of NPS can convey information beyond a single cross-sectional measure. While even those whose NPS improved were at increased hazard of MCI or dementia, hazard increased as a function of the severity of the NPS trajectory.

Introduction

It is well established that neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) frequently accompany dementia 1-3. More recently, it has become clear that NPS are associated with increased risk of progression to dementia in those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 4,5 and with increased risk of incident MCI among cognitively normal elderly 6.

Increasingly, NPS are being thought of as a prodrome to dementia 7. Criteria for mild behavioral impairment (MBI) have been proposed 8, and a rating instrument has been developed 9. In a population based Australian study, almost half of individuals with MCI, and over a quarter of cognitively normal elderly participants, met criteria for MBI 10. Additional studies that required symptoms to persist for at least six months found lower prevalences among individuals with subjective cognitive impairment (5.8%) and MCI (14.2%). 11,12

There is a rich literature on possible mechanisms linking NPS to dementia. The relationship may be directly causal, in that NPS lead to dementia 13. This might occur by activation of the neuroendocrine axis 14 or through deposition of β-amyloid 15,16. NPS may also share a common cause with dementia; essentially the NPS are a non-cognitive symptom of the same underlying pathology. For example, apathy has been associated with disruptions in circuitry linking the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia 17, and has also been associated with vascular disease 18,19. Finally, it may be that certain NPS act in concert with dementia-related neuropathology to either hasten or exacerbate cognitive decline. For example, the association between apathy or depression and cognitive decline varies as a function of APOE genotype 20,21

To further understand the role of NPS in the development of dementia, we previously modeled the association between types of NPS (based on latent classes of individual domains) and risk of later diagnosis with MCI 22 or dementia 23 among volunteers followed by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center 24. In both cases, these latent classes were derived from patterns of domains observed at a single (baseline) visit. While NPS class membership measured cross-sectionally was a potent predictor, it was clear that additional information about risk of MCI or dementia diagnosis could be gleaned from the course of NPS over time. For example, members of the high-risk class at both the baseline and second visit had greater risk of progression than members of the high-risk class at the baseline visit only.

While there is an existing literature on course of NPS in dementia 25-27 or MCI 28,29, there is much less known about NPS course prior to MCI, in cognitively normal individuals. The course of specific NPS, such as depression 30-33 or apathy 34 has been studied in cognitively normal elderly, but NPS have not typically been considered in aggregate.

In this analysis, we identified subtypes of NPS course, over four visits, among NACC volunteers who were cognitively normal at baseline, and assessed the association between these subtypes and risk of later MCI or dementia. We hypothesized that individuals with a persistent or worsening course of NPS would be at greater risk of later MCI or dementia diagnosis.

Methods

National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center

We analyzed data collected from participants evaluated approximately annually at one of 34 National Institute on Aging supported Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADC’s) between September 2005 and February 2017. To be included in the analysis, participants had to be over age 60 at their first visit, cognitively normal at their first 4 visits (over approximately 3 years), and have at least one additional visit. Participants also had to have at least one non-missing NPS score during their first four visits. The research conducted at all ADCs was overseen by local institutional review boards and written informed consent was obtained for all participants. A complete description of NACC methods and the Uniform Data Set (UDS), which includes demographics, medical history, family history, behavioral and functional assessments, and a neuropsychological battery, is published elsewhere 24. The data that support the findings of this study are available from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center. Restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for this study. Data are available with the permission of NACC.

Measures

The Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) was administered rated by certified clinicians or health professionals using information from knowledgeable informants reporting on their observations of study participants. NPI-Q is a simplified clinical measure of dementia-related psychiatric symptoms in 12 domains: agitation (e.g., being “hard to handle”), delusions, hallucinations, depression, euphoria (e.g., excessive happiness), aberrant motor behavior (e.g., engaging in repetitive activities like pacing), apathy, irritability, disinhibition (e.g., impulsivity), anxiety, sleep (waking at night, rising too early, or excessive napping), and eating (change in appetite or food tastes) 35. NPI-Q domain scores take values of 0 (not present), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). Notably, NPI-Q total scores that were used in the analyses were calculated as the sum across the 12 NPI-Q domains. These rate the presence or absence of symptoms in the last 30 days that are new to the participant and therefore do not represent long-standing psychiatric symptoms or conditions. Domain scores could range from 0–36. Additionally, the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) 36 and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a 15-item screening measure for depression in older adults 37, were also administered.

Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Diagnoses

Cognitive diagnoses were made locally using all available data, in most cases via consensus conference. When consensus conference was not possible, diagnoses were made by a single physician 24,38. MCI was diagnosed using modified Petersen criteria 39. Alzheimer disease (AD) diagnoses were made using NINCDS/ADRDA criteria or NIA-AA criteria 40,41. Lewy body dementia (LBD) diagnoses were made using consortium criteria 42,43, vascular dementia (VaD) diagnoses were made using NINDS/AIREN criteria 44, and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) using criteria described in Neary, et al 45.

Analyses

Baseline demographics and ratings were summarized separately for participants who did or did not receive a diagnosis of MCI or dementia during the follow-up period (i.e. after five annual visits where the participant was cognitively normal). We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) 46 to model subtypes of NPS trajectories over time. Typically, NPS might be modeled over time using a random effects model 47, which would generate estimates of intercept, slope, and possibly quadratic terms to characterize the course of groups of NPS symptoms. GMM allows for the estimation of latent classes (groups) of individuals based on their NPS course, with separate intercept, slope, and quadratic terms generated for each latent class. Since NPI-Q scores were heavily right-skewed, meaning the majority of participants had scores of 0 or close to 0, we used a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model 48,49. These models are fit in two parts: the first is a logistic model where the outcome is 0 vs &gt;0; the second is a Poisson model with NPI-Q scores greater than 0 treated as count data. To aid model convergence, it is typical to only allow the Poisson part of the model to vary across classes. We used Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio tests 50,51 to choose the optimal number of classes. Model fit was assessed via comparison of observed and predicted trajectories.

We fit Cox proportional hazards models with latent trajectory classes as predictors and adjusting for age at baseline, sex, years of education, and baseline MMSE. We used an adaptation of Vermunt’s three-step method to adjust for uncertainty in class membership 52,53. In the present case, we used the first four visits of each participant to model the trajectory classes (at least 3 visits are required to plot a curved line), and subsequent visits to model survival. As such, individuals who received diagnoses of MCI or dementia prior to their fifth visit were excluded from the analysis. Had we instead modeled survival using the first four visits as well, we would have introduced circularity; an individual might have been diagnosed with dementia at their second visit, and developed worsening NPS only after that diagnosis. In that case, it would not make sense to say that membership in a worsening NPS class was predictive of increasing risk of dementia, since the temporal ordering had occurred in the reverse direction.

The survival models we fit allow for the inclusion of right-censored individuals (those who do not experience the outcome of interest during the period of observation), but it is assumed that this censorship is not associated with failure 54. This assumption of “noninformative censoring” may have been violated in both directions; more impaired volunteers may have had more difficulty attending follow-up visits, but might also be more motivated to be evaluated. This issue is a known limitation of the NACC 55 and many other longitudinal studies 56.

Results

Table 1 includes baseline demographic characteristics of 4,184 volunteers in the analytic sample, tabulated as a function of whether they remained cognitively normal throughout the period of observation, were diagnosed with MCI on at least one visit (but never diagnosed with dementia), or were diagnosed with dementia on at least one visit. The majority were caucasian (82%), female (67%), and had at least one first degree relative with a history of cognitive impairment (57%). Volunteers were well-educated, typically had high MMSE scores, and few or no neuropsychiatric symptoms. We also tabulated numbers of participants reporting use of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or antipsychotics at any of their first 4 visits. In addition to the 4 visits used to model NPI-Q trajectory, volunteers had an average of 4.4 (1.9) additional study visits and 3.5 (2.0) years of survival, resulting in 14,484 person-years of observation.

We fit a series of ZIP GMM models with 2–6 classes. These models have class-specific random intercepts on the logistic model, and class-specific intercept and slopes for both the logistic and Poisson models. Based on the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test, a 5 class model did not fit the data statistically significantly better than a 4 class model (LMR LRT: 58.56; df: 4; p=0.456), but a 4 class model did fit the data significantly better than a 3 class model (LMR LRT: 135.98; df: 4; p=0.009). The 4 class model with a constant intercept variance across classes fit the data significantly worse than a model in which the intercept variance was allowed to vary (LRT: 14.45; df: 3; p=0.002), but a model that included quadratic terms for both the logistic and Poisson models did not fit significantly better than a model without those terms (LRT: 4.89; df: 5; p=0.18). Parameter estimates for the final 4 class model are shown in table 2. Figure 1 shows fitted NPI-Q trajectories for each class, along with observed trajectories for each individual (assigned to the class to which they were most like to belong). The majority of the sample (65%) would be expected to belong to a class (class 4) with constant low or nonexistent NPS (“Normal”). The next most likely class, class 1, (16%) show a decrease over time in NPI-Q total score (“Decreasing”), while class 2 (14%) show an increase over time (“Increasing”). The smallest class (class 3, 5%) had high and fluctuating NPI-Q total scores (“High”).

During the period of observation a total of 462 volunteers were diagnosed with MCI (but never dementia), and 220 were diagnosed with dementia (and may or may not have also been diagnosed with MCI prior). Of those who received dementia diagnoses, 133 were AD, 6, were LBD, 1 was VaD, 64 were Mixed AD/VaD, and 16 were other dementias including Parkinson dementia and alcohol-related dementia. Due to the small number of non-AD dementias, it was not possible to compare trajectory class membership by dementia type.

We next modeled MCI and dementia-free survival in a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for age at baseline, sex, years of education, and baseline MMSE. To test the proportional hazards assumption, we regressed scaled Schoenfeld residuals on time, and found no evidence of violation 57. Figure 2 is a Kaplan-Meier plot showing a gradient of risk as a function of latent class membership and table 3 contains hazard ratio estimates. Compared to class 4 (“Normal”) (the reference class), each of the other latent trajectory classes had statistically significantly increased hazard of diagnosis with MCI or dementia, and hazard increased as a function of the severity of the NPS, though hazard ratios for classes 1–3 were not statistically significantly different from each other. Of particular note is the association between membership in the class with decreasing NPS over time and increased hazard. It is clear that it matters not only where a participant is at a particular point in time, but also where they’ve been. Older age was associated with greater hazard of diagnosis, while female sex and education were associated with decreased hazard.

Discussion

We have modeled classes of NACC volunteers on the basis of their NPI-Q trajectories over 4 approximately annual visits, and have identified groups of individuals who improve over time, who worsen over time, as well as a small group of individuals with high and fluctuating NPS. While it is well established the NPS are associated with later diagnosis of MCI and/or dementia when measured cross-sectionally, to our knowledge this is the first time that trajectories of NPS scores have been described in older people who remain cognitively normal for several years, and the first time that the hazard of these diagnoses has been modelled as a function of NPS trajectory. Based on the difference in hazard among the classes, it is clear that NPS trajectory among cognitively normal individuals provides prognostic information above and beyond what is obtained from a single cross-sectional measure of NPS. The fact that membership in the declining NPS was still associated with increased hazard of MCI or dementia would seem to argue against the hypothesis that NPS represent modifiable risk factors for dementia and for the hypothesis of a common cause, however, intervention trials for individual NPS would be needed to definitively test this point.

As expected, older age 58was associated with greater risk of MCI or dementia, and education with decreased risk 59. Female sex is sometimes associated with greater risk of dementia 60, though this effect may be limited to AD 58,61, and perhaps only in certain age groups 62-64. We found an association between female sex and lower risk of MCI or dementia; one possible explanation is that the effect of female sex on dementia risk is mediated through their greater risk of NPS, and since our analyses adjusted for NPS, we may have “adjusted away” the sex effect. That said, there is also a literature suggesting that depression is associated with increased risk of AD in men more than in women 65,66.

Strengths of this work include the large sample, which allowed for precise estimation and the ability to identify potentially rare NPS trajectory classes. Few if any other datasets exist with such long annual follow-up on cognitively normal participants, thus allowing for the study of these individuals prior to the onset of any cognitive decline. Growth mixture modeling allowed for data-driven identification of trajectory classes, and use of a corrected 3-step procedure to estimate hazard of diagnosis as a function of trajectory class resulted in unbiased estimates.

Weaknesses include potential selection biases related to the nature of the study sample, which consisted of highly educated, predominantly white volunteers with high rates of family history of cognitive decline. Rates of NPS, latent trajectory class prevalences, and hazards of MCI or dementia diagnoses may have been biased upwards. It is useful to note, however, that such biases should be minimized by the fact that these volunteers began their study participation while still cognitively normal. Additionally, rates of NPS severity on each of the individual NPI-Q domains were very similar to those found among cognitively normal participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which, unlike, the NACC, is population based 67. As we have described previously, hazards of diagnosis of MCI or dementia as a function of individual NPI-Q domains at baseline were also very similar between NACC and Mayo22.

We used the NPI-Q to quantify NPS; this scale has not been validated for use among cognitively healthy individuals. Some questions are clearly geared toward dementia, and may not have been sensitive to more subtle symptoms. Additionally, the questionnaire was completed by a proxy informant. While this is necessary in the case of individuals with dementia, a proxy informant might not be as good an informant as a cognitively healthy participant themselves. We could not find any published estimates of concordance between self- vs. informant-ratings on the NPI-Q (likely because the NPI-Q was not designed to be self-rated), but estimates of concordance between informant-rated NPI-Q and self-reports of other scales (e.g., the GDS) among individuals with Parkinson’s disease 68 or cognitive impairment 69 were poor. It is unclear whether this lack of concordance is due to the difference in scale, cognitive impairments in these groups, or lack of inter-rater reliability. If the use of an informant reduced the sensitivity of the NPI-Q, it would likely have biased our findings toward, rather than away from the null hypothesis.

As described in the methods, in order to avoid circularity we limited the sample to individuals who remained cognitively healthy at their first 4 NACC visits and modeled survival using observations after those visits. This excluded individuals who developed MCI or dementia more quickly, and who may also have had qualitatively different NPS trajectories.

As seen in table 1, one fifth of the sample reported antidepressant use on at least one visit. It is possible that antidepressant use may have altered individuals’ NPS trajectories from what they might have been in the absence of exposure to these medications, which in turn may have biased estimates of the relationship between class membership and diagnosis. Such bias was likely to be toward, rather than away from the null as it would have moved people with NPS into the reference class, or perhaps the class with decreasing NPS over time. Based on most likely class membership, rates of use were 38% (decreasing NPS), 35% (increasing), 61%, (high) and 16% (normal) for classes 1–4. Use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines was relatively low in this sample.

Conclusions

These findings provide further evidence for the important role of NPS in cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults, extending previous cross-sectional considerations to longitudinal trajectories of NPS. Future directions of this work include exploring the relationship between NPS and cognitive trajectories, and analysing the longitudinal trajectories of individual NPS domains, as total NPI-Q scores were used in the present analyses. Our previous cross-sectional analysis showed that specific NPS: apathy, depression, irritability and nighttime behaviors were associated with cognitive decline (Leoutsakos et al., 2015). This may be due to the fact that these are the most common NPS among cognitively normal older adults, and therefore sufficient power exists to detect the association. NPS may represent a treatment target to slow or prevent cognitive decline, or they may be useful in identifying individuals who should be targeted for mechanistic or prevention studies. An understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying NPS is needed to inform treatment development (Hirao et al., 2015). Future multi-modal neuroimaging and biomarker studies of NPS in cognitively normal individuals may have important implications for identifying early neuropathological changes associated with cognitive decline.

Key Points:

Trajectories of NPS among cognitively normal older people can be usefully grouped into classes.

Trajectory of NPS conveys more useful information than a single cross-sectional measurement.

Membership in each of the latent classes characterized by presence of NPS was associated with increased hazard of MCI or dementia as compared to the class consistently with few or no NPS

There was a clear gradient of risk of MCI or dementia from the decreasing NPS class, to the increasing class, to the high and fluctuating class
