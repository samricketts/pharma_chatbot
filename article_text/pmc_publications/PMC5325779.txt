Alterations of the transverse relaxation rate, R2, measured using MRI, are observed in older persons with Alzheimer’s (AD) dementia. However, the spatial pattern of these alterations and the degree to which they reflect the accumulation of common age-related neuropathologies are unknown. In this study, we characterized the profile of R2 alterations in post-mortem brains of persons with clinical diagnosis of AD dementia and investigated how the profile differs after accounting for neuropathologic indices of AD, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, hippocampal sclerosis and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43. Data came from 567 post-mortem brains donated by participants in two cohort studies of aging and dementia. R2 was quantified using fast spin echo imaging. Voxelwise linear regression examined R2 alterations between subjects diagnosed with AD dementia at death and those with no cognitive impairment. Voxels showing significant R2 alterations were clustered into regions of interest (ROIs). Three R2 profiles were compared, which were adjusted for (1) demographics only; (2) demographics and AD pathology; (3) demographics, AD pathology and other common neuropathologies. R2 alterations were observed throughout the hemisphere, most commonly in white matter. Of the distinct ROIs identified, the largest region encompassed large portions of white matter in all lobes. This ROI became smaller in size but remained largely intact after adjusting for AD and other neuropathologic indices. Further, R2 alterations identify AD dementia with improved accuracy, above and beyond demographics and neuropathologic indices (p&lt;0.0001). In conclusion, R2 alterations in AD dementia are not solely reflective of common age-related neuropathologies, suggesting that other mechanisms are at work.

INTRODUCTION

The pathologies of Alzheimer’s (AD), cerebrovascular (CVD), Lewy body diseases (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis, and the more recently discovered transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are among the most common causes of dementia in old age. The accumulation of these pathologies leads to disruption of iron homeostasis (Peters, et al., 2015) and increased free water content due to demyelination and atrophy (Zhan, et al., 2015). These changes in brain tissue properties can be detected by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxometry, both in vivo and ex vivo. The transverse relaxation rate constant, R2, is one such parameter which measures the decay of transverse magnetization.

Alterations of the transverse relaxation have been observed in vivo in older persons with memory complaints (House, et al., 2006), mild cognitive impairment, and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (Arfanakis, et al., 2007, Bartzokis, et al., 2003, Granziera, et al., 2015, Luo, et al., 2013). Using data from ex vivo imaging, we previously showed that prolonged transverse relaxation time is correlated with pathologic burdens of AD, infarcts and hippocampal sclerosis, thus providing direct evidence for the neuropathologies’ involvement in these alterations (Dawe, et al., 2014). Further, we demonstrated that common neuropathologic indices are not solely responsible for the relationship between transverse relaxation alterations and late life cognitive performance (Dawe, et al., 2014, Dawe, et al., 2016).

In this study, we further characterized the profile of transverse relaxation alterations in post-mortem brains of persons with AD dementia, and investigated how the profile differs after accounting for neuropathologic indices of AD, cerebral infarcts, LBD, hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43. Data came from 567 autopsied participants in two cohort studies of aging and dementia. Transverse relaxation rate (R2) was quantified using fast spin echo imaging. At each voxel, R2 alteration was captured as the model adjusted difference between participants with AD dementia and those with no cognitive impairment. Significant voxels were identified and clustered into regions of interest (ROIs). Spatial distributions of ROIs were described, and comparisons were made between the profiles before and after accounting for the neuropathologies.

This current study extends our previous work (Dawe, et al., 2014, Dawe, et al., 2016) in three important ways. First, we focus on a complementary clinical outcome, i.e. diagnosis of AD dementia. While continuous cognitive measures are well-established indicators for capturing progression of AD dementia, translation of findings using cognition to the clinical context is not always straightforward. Direct comparisons of persons with AD dementia and those with no cognitive impairment are useful in this regard and are more accessible to clinician-scientists. Second, we incorporate pathologic indices that were not included in the previous study, which provides a more thorough coverage of neuropathologic burden in older age. Third, we include additional data that are newly available and the increase in sample size provides further precision in profiling R2 alterations.

METHODS

Study Participants

Clinical, neuropathologic, and ex vivo imaging data came from 567 autopsied participants in two ongoing cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Study details are described elsewhere (Bennett, et al., 2012a, Bennett, et al., 2012b). Briefly, participants were community-based older persons without known dementia at enrollment, and all agreed to annual clinical and neuropsychological evaluations and brain donation after death. Both studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. Informed consent and an anatomical gift act were obtained from each participant.

By July 1st, 2016, 1,572 of the total 3,226 enrolled participants had died, and 1,358 had gone through autopsy (autopsy rate &gt; 86%). Of the autopsied cases, 1,325 were reviewed and approved by a board certified neuropathologist. The ex vivo imaging project started in 2006 and is currently ongoing. At the time of analyses, there were 587 autopsied participants with processed ex vivo imaging data, and we excluded 20 with non-AD dementia. Of the remaining 567, 244 (43.0%) were diagnosed with AD dementia at the time of death, 153 (27.0%) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 170 (30.0%) with no cognitive impairment. Primary analyses were based on those who were either diagnosed with AD dementia or no impairment (N=414). In secondary analyses, we explored R2 alterations in participants with MCI.

Clinical diagnosis of AD dementia

Each year, participants had a uniform structured evaluation that included a physical examination and detailed cognitive testing which assessed multiple domains of cognitive abilities. Results of cognitive testing were reviewed by a neuropsychologist for the presence of cognitive impairment. Annual clinical diagnoses were made based on the evaluations by the clinician. The diagnosis of AD dementia follows the recommendation of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (McKhann, et al., 1984). The criteria require a history of cognitive decline and evidence of impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain. The criteria do not require functional impairment. We defined MCI as a derivative of the McKhann criteria but only required impairment in a single cognitive domain. MCI here is intended to identify everyone who is not cognitively normal and without dementia. Thus, all participants would be classified as having dementia (and its cause), MCI, or neither (“No cognitive impairment”). Detailed description of the implementation of the criteria is described elsewhere (Bennett, et al., 2006a, Bennett, et al., 2002).

After a participant died, a neurologist reviewed all available clinical data and provided a summary diagnostic opinion regarding the most plausible diagnosis at the time of death. The summary diagnosis was made blinded to all postmortem data, and case conferences were held for consensus on select cases, as previously described (Schneider, et al., 2007).

Ex vivo imaging and R2 quantification

Brains were removed and bisected after death following a standard procedure (Bennett, et al., 2006b). Hemispheres chosen for imaging were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in 4-degree Celsius refrigerators. Ex vivo image processing and R2 quantification follow the same protocols as previously described (Dawe, et al., 2014, Dawe, et al., 2016). Briefly, MRI scans were performed on average 41.4 days (SD 19.8, range 23–235 days) postmortem, and each scan included a 2D turbo spin echo (TSE) sequence with multiple echo times. The R2 value was quantified voxel by voxel from the TSE data by fitting a monoexponential decay function, and these images were spatially warped to a common template to facilitate voxelwise analyses. Because four different MRI scanners were used to acquire TSE data over the course of several years, we needed to account for instrument differences. Therefore, within each group of hemispheres imaged on a given scanner, we computed the mean and standard deviation for each voxel and used these to carry out a scanner-specific, voxel-by-voxel normalization of the R2 values for each hemisphere.

Neuropathologic Assessments

Neuropathologic evaluations were conducted by examiners blinded to all clinical data. Hemispheres were cut coronally using a Plexiglas jig into 1-cm slabs, tissue blocks from predetermined brain regions were dissected, and 6 μm sections were stained for pathology quantification (Schneider, et al., 2012). Neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in five cortical regions were visualized using modified Bielschowsky silver stain. For each index, the counts were first scaled within region and then averaged across regions. A composite continuous measure of AD pathology was acquired by averaging summary scores of the three AD indices (Bennett, et al., 2003). Pathologic AD diagnosis according to NIA-Reagan criteria (intermediate or high likelihood) was used for descriptive purpose (Hyman and Trojanowski, 1997). Gross infarcts were identified by examining slabs and pictures from both hemispheres and confirmed histologically, as previously described (Schneider, et al., 2003). Microinfarcts were identified using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain in a minimum of nine regions, including six cortical regions, two subcortical regions, and midbrain (Arvanitakis, et al., 2011). Presence of Lewy body pathology was assessed using antibodies to α-synuclein in 6 regions including substantia nigra, limbic and neocortices (Schneider, et al., 2006). Hippocampal sclerosis was identified as severe neuronal loss and gliosis in hippocampus or subiculum using H&amp;E stain (Nag, et al., 2015). Counts of TDP43 cytoplasmic inclusions were assessed using antibodies to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pS409/410; 1:100) and a semi-quantitative measure was used to capture the staging of TDP-43 pathology from amygdala, through hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, to neocortical regions (Yu, et al., 2015).

Statistical Analysis

Demographic and neuropathologic characteristics were compared between participants with AD dementia and no cognitive impairment using t test, χ2 test, or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. R2 alteration at each of the 400,000 tissue-containing voxels was examined using multivariable linear regression models. In these models, the R2 values were the continuous outcome, and a binary indicator for diagnosis of AD dementia was the predictor. The regression coefficients estimate differences in voxelwise R2 values between the two groups. To control for inflation of Type-I error due to multiple testing, p-values were adjusted using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Voxels showing significant R2 alterations were clustered into regions of interest (ROIs), and only those regions with at least 100 contiguous voxels were retained.

The voxelwise regression analyses were repeated three times, and each time the model was controlled for additional covariates. Specifically, model 1 controlled only for demographics; model 2 controlled for demographics and AD pathology; and model 3 controlled for demographics, AD and other common pathologies. As a result, three profiles of R2 alteration were obtained and visually compared. If R2 alterations are largely driven by AD or other common age-related pathologies, we expect to see substantial shrinkage in size or even disappearance of ROIs from model 1 through model 3. For each significant ROI identified in the analyses in models 1 through 3, we extracted each specimen’s mean normalized R2 by averaging over all voxels within the ROI.

To investigate the contribution of R2 in identifying AD dementia, we fit a series of logistic regression models with AD dementia versus no cognitive impairment as the binary outcome. Wald tests compared areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve from models with and without R2. The area under the curve, ranging from 0.5 (no discrimination) to a theoretical maximum of 1 (perfect discrimination), summarizes how accurately AD dementia was identified by each model in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and thus captures the independent contribution due to R2.

RESULTS

Demographic and neuropathologic characteristics

Compared with participants with no cognitive impairment, participants with AD dementia were older (Table 1). We did not observe significant difference in sex, race, or years of education between the two groups. Consistent with our previous report (Bennett, et al., 2012c), age-related pathologies were common in post-mortem brains of participants with no cognitive impairment. Notably, almost half (48.2%) of those participants met NIA-Reagan criteria for pathologic AD, 31.8% had gross infarcts, and 18.8% had Lewy bodies. On the other hand, participants with AD dementia on average had more severe AD and TDP-43 pathologies, and were more likely to have gross infarcts, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis (Table 1). Comorbidities were also much more common in AD dementia. Almost 90% of the subjects with AD dementia had multiple neuropathologies present in their brains, in comparison with 54.7% of those with no cognitive impairment.

R2 alterations in AD dementia

We first examined the R2 alterations in AD dementia without adjusting for any neuropathology (model 1). R2 alterations were widespread across the whole hemisphere, and most commonly observed in white matter (Figure 1-A). Two separate regions were identified. For each region, the location, volume, and the average difference in the R2 value are summarized in Table 2. Briefly, the largest region (region 1) of R2 alterations covered large portions of the white matter in the frontal lobe, and extended to the white matter in the parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. The transverse relaxation rate in this region was on average slower in AD dementia, compared with no cognitive impairment. The second region was in the insular gray matter and had much smaller volume. Notably, the transverse relaxation rate in this gray matter region was faster in AD dementia.

Since AD pathology is the primary driver of dementia and prior work suggests it is strongly associated with R2 alterations, we refit the model by controlling for demographics and the overall burden of AD pathology (model 2). Three separate regions were identified, and we observed a certain amount of shrinkage in the size of regions showing R2 alterations (Figure 1-B). The largest region involved the white matter of all four lobes. This and a smaller region in white matter of the parietal lobe were derivatives of region 1 from the previous model, and transverse relaxation rates in both regions were slower in AD dementia. The third region was in the insular gray matter, with faster transverse relaxation rate in AD dementia (Table 2).

Next, we augmented the model by controlling for cerebral infarcts, Lewy body, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43 pathologies in addition to demographics and AD pathology (model 3). In this model, we observed further shrinkage in size of regions showing significant R2 alterations (Figure 1-C). Nonetheless, substantial R2 alterations remained. Of the five regions identified, four were derivatives of region 1 from the first model. While split and smaller in size, they still encompassed large portions of the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobe white matter. Consistent with the results from the previous models, the transverse relaxation rates in these white matter regions were slower in AD dementia. By contrast, the fifth region observed in the insular gray matter again showed faster transverse relaxation rate in AD dementia (Table 2). Figure 2 provides three-dimensional contrast of the R2 alterations in AD demenita from all three models. Regions in green are derived from model 1 which controlled for demographics only, regions in blue are from model 2 which controlled for demographics and AD pathology, and regions in purple are from model 3 which controlled for demographics, AD pathology and other neuropathologies.

R2 contributes to the risk of AD dementia

The persistent presence of R2 alterations in postmortem brain of participants with AD dementia suggests that not all the R2 alterations are reflective of neuropathologies measured in this study. In the final set of analyses, we investigated whether R2 holds utility in identifying subjects with AD dementia compared to those with no cognitive impairment. We focused on the R2 values in the five regions acquired from the last model (model 3). Comparisons of areas under the ROC curve show that R2 in these 5 regions improved the accuracy of identifying AD dementia (Figure 3). Specifically, the area under the curve from the model adjusted for demographics and AD pathology was 0.75, and inclusion of other pathologic indices increased the area to 0.82 (p=0.0001). By including the measure of R2 alterations, the area under the curve was further increased to 0.88 (p&lt;0.0001).

R2 alterations in mild cognitive impairment

Finally, we repeated the voxel-wise regression analyses to examine R2 alterations in cases of MCI. The initial voxelwise analysis of all ~400,000 tissue-containing voxels did not yield any significant region that satisfied both the 5% FDR for voxels and the minimum size requirement (i.e. 100 contiguous voxels) for regions. To reduce the burden of multiple testing, in a post hoc exploratory analysis, we constrained the analysis to voxels showing significant R2 alterations in model 3 for AD dementia. We identified 4 separate regions with evidence of slower transverse relaxation rate in MCI, which were scattered in white matter of the frontal, and parietal or occipital lobes (Supplemental Figure 1). Inclusion of the R2 measures from these regions increased the area under the ROC curve for identifying MCI from 0.63 to 0.68, yet it didn’t reach the common threshold for statistical significance (p=0.052).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we leveraged clinical, neuropathologic and ex vivo imaging data from hundreds of community-based older persons to examine the profiles of voxelwise R2 alterations in AD dementia. Our findings suggest that R2 alterations span the entire hemisphere, including large portions of white matter. We observed an overall reduction in volume of significant R2 alterations after accounting for AD pathology and other neuropathologic indices that are known to cause dementia. However, R2 alterations remained prominent across all four lobes. We further demonstrated that R2 alterations identify AD dementia with improved accuracy, above and beyond demographics and neuropathologic indices. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the degree to which R2 alterations in AD dementia are reflective of the accumulation of common age-related neuropathologies.

We observed ex vivo white matter R2 alterations in AD dementia. The main regions are found in the white matter with significant reduction of R2. This finding is consistent with prior findings, both in vivo and ex vivo. An earlier study estimates that frontal white matter R2 in AD patients is 1 standard deviation below that of controls (Bartzokis, et al., 2003). A more recent study extends the finding by showing that reduction of R2 is also present in other white matter regions including temporal lobe and internal capsule (House, et al., 2006). It has also been reported that ex vivo transverse relaxation is slower in parietal and temporal white matter of pathologically confirmed Alzheimer’s (Besson, et al., 1992).

We compared the profiles of R2 alterations before and after accounting for AD pathology and other neuropathologic indices. Our findings have several implications. First, the results lend further support that age-related pathologies known to cause dementia contribute to white matter damage in AD dementia. Regions showing R2 alterations became smaller in size after we adjusted the model by controlling for AD pathology. Biochemical analyses of AD white matter also confirm that extensive axonal demyelination underlies Alzheimer’s pathology (Roher, et al., 2002). Other evidence, however, suggests that morphological components such as astrocyte to oligodendrocyte ratio differ between white matter disease and Alzheimer’s disease (Sjobeck and Englund, 2003). Indeed, while AD pathology is the main driver of dementia, the presence of R2 alterations remains evident after adjusting for the measure of AD pathology. Mounting evidence from histopathological studies demonstrates that AD pathology is often accompanied by other comorbid conditions and mixed pathologies are the most common cause of dementia (Barnes, et al., 2015, James, et al., 2012, Schneider, et al., 2009, White, et al., 2016). This is true in the current study in which almost 90% of the cases with AD dementia exhibited multiple neuropathologies. After accounting for cerebral infarcts, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 pathologies, we observe further shrinkage of the regions with R2 alterations.

The persistence of R2 alterations in a large area of white matter after adjustment for common age-related neuropathologies suggests that white matter change is not solely reflective of commonly measured neuropathologies. Investigation of other mechanisms that underlie R2 alterations may provide novel therapeutic targets to combat late life cognitive impairment and dementia. One potential contributor is vascular burden, which may in part be reflected by white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). Increase in WMHs in prefrontal cortex is associated with age-related changes in memory functioning (Nordahl, et al., 2006). Recent studies indicate that WMHs have little impact on the progression of Alzheimer’s specific biomarkers (Lo and Jagust, 2012) and affect late life cognitive decline independent of amyloid pathology (Vemuri, et al., 2015). Progression of WMHs in the parietal lobe, but not other regions, may predict incident AD dementia (Brickman, et al., 2015). Future studies need to disentangle the relationship of WMHs and R2 alterations in AD dementia. Notably, our ex vivo data show that R2 alterations improve the accuracy of identifying AD dementia, in addition to the common neuropathologic indices. We have previously demonstrated a linear relationship between in vivo and ex vivo R2 measures (Dawe, et al., 2014). Taken together, our results suggest that in vivo R2 alterations may serve as a biomarker for AD dementia, in addition to other markers such as PIB-PET (Pittsburgh compound B PET).

We only captured very limited R2 alterations in gray matter. We identified one region in the insular gray matter where R2 is greater in AD dementia. A related finding in the same cohort has been reported previously, where T2 (reciprocal of R2) shortening in the insula is associated with more AD pathology (Dawe, et al., 2014). This relationship may be attributable to elevated redox-active iron concentration, in part as the consequence of plaque and tangle accumulations (Smith, et al., 1997). However, new data from this study further demonstrate that the insular R2 alterations are not fully explained by AD pathology or several other common age-related pathologies. This new finding renders support that other factors may contribute to the disruption of iron homeostasis in AD dementia. One plausible explanation for lack of R2 alterations in gray matter was noted previously in hippocampus (Schenck, et al., 2006). The transverse relaxation rate accelerates with increasing iron concentration but decelerates with increasing water content. Both effects may occur and offset each other, more likely so in gray matter. Studies show that, with increasing age, brain ferritin iron level is elevated in cortical and subcortical gray matter, but lower in frontal white matter (Bartzokis, et al., 2007). Higher iron concentration induces oxidative damage (Quintana, et al., 2006, Smith, et al., 1997) and leads to myelin breakdown (Bartzokis, 2011). This demyelination, in turn, contributes to increasing free water content in brain tissue, which has a slowing effect on R2.

The overall findings in this study are consistent with our prior work on late life cognitive function (Dawe, et al., 2014, Dawe, et al., 2016). Both suggest that R2 alterations are implicated in cognition and AD dementia, above and beyond the influences of common age-related brain pathologies. This work expands upon our previous findings in several important ways. First, we elected to use a complementary clinical outcome of AD dementia, and findings from the current work provide information specific to disease status (i.e. AD dementia versus no impairment), a comparison that cannot be easily achieved via continuous cognitive measures. We are not aware of any study that has directly profiled the spatial patterns of transverse relaxation alterations in community based older persons with AD dementia relative to persons with no cognitive impairment. Second, we incorporated additional pathologic indices that were not previously investigated, which provides a more thorough coverage of neuropathologic burden in older age. Specifically, we included indices for Lewy body pathology and a less well-studied pathology, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Recent studies suggest that these pathologies are quite common among older persons and their inclusion expands on our prior work and helps calibrate the profile of R2 alterations in AD dementia. Third, the present findings contribute to the growing body of literature suggesting that AD dementia reflects multiple disease processes. AD dementia was long thought to be due to a single disease specific to plaques and tangles. By directly interrogating the profile of R2 between subjects with and without AD dementia, before and after adjusting for contributions of AD and other non-AD pathologies, we provide novel evidence which identify other mechanism that contributes to AD dementia. This cannot be readily deduced from our prior work.

The study has strength and limitations. Data came from two studies of aging that require annual clinical evaluations and brain donation after death to support the collection of neuropathology and ex vivo imaging data. This study design allows us to efficiently merge different data from the same participants and examine the correlates of clinical and imaging features above and beyond the influence of neuropathology. The voxelwise approach of identifying R2 alterations provides comprehensive coverage throughout the entire brain hemisphere. Limitations include the use of only one modality, namely R2. Ex vivo imaging is not capable of capturing longitudinal change in R2. Finally, participants in the study are older and have higher education, and our findings may not be generalizable to the general population.

Model 3	Region 5	Insular GM (volume: 232 mm3, β̄ : 0.348)	
† Regions due to artifact of brain atrophy that are sensitive to outliers are not included.

Each region is described in terms of principal location, volume (mm3), and β̄ that represents the difference in standard deviation of R2 values between AD dementia and no cognitive impairment. Model 1 is adjusted only for age and sex; model 2 is adjusted for age, sex and AD pathology; and model 3 is adjusted for age, sex, AD, cerebral infarcts, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43 pathologies.

WM: white matter, GM: gray matter

Highlights

Ex vivo R2 alterations are pervasive in brains with AD dementia.

R2 alterations are smaller in size after accounting for common neuropathologies.

R2 alterations in white matter remain after accounting for common neuropathologies.

R2 alterations identify AD dementia with improved accuracy.
