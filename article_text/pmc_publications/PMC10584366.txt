Background:

Data from human studies suggest that immune dysregulation is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and cognitive decline and that neurites may be affected early in the disease trajectory. Data from animal studies further indicate that dysfunction in astrocytes and inflammation may have a pivotal role in facilitating dendritic damage, which has been linked with negative cognitive outcomes. To elucidate these relationships further, we have examined the relationship between astrocyte and immune dysregulation, AD-related pathology, and neuritic microstructure in AD-vulnerable regions in late life.

Methods:

We evaluated panels of immune, vascular, and AD-related protein markers in blood and conducted in vivo multi-shell neuroimaging using Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) to assess indices of neuritic density (NDI) and dispersion (ODI) in brain regions vulnerable to AD in a cohort of older adults (n=109).

Results:

When examining all markers in tandem, higher plasma GFAP levels were strongly related to lower neurite dispersion (ODI) in grey matter. No biomarker associations were found with higher neuritic density. Associations between GFAP and neuritic microstructure were not significantly impacted by symptom status, APOE status, or plasma Aβ42/40 ratio; however, there was a large sex effect observed for neurite dispersion, wherein negative associations between GFAP and ODI were only observed in females.

Discussion:

This study provides a comprehensive, concurrent appraisal of immune, vascular, and AD-related biomarkers in the context of advanced grey matter neurite orientation and dispersion methodology. Sex may be an important modifier of the complex associations between astrogliosis, immune dysregulation, and brain microstructure in older adults.

pmc1. Introduction:

Pathological aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are characterized by early innate immune dysfunction1, 2, involving chronic inflammatory responses3 and dysregulated glial activation, that have been shown to correlate with poor cognitive function and future decline4, 5. While there is mounting evidence to suggest that immune dysregulation is a core feature of AD, the neuroanatomical mechanisms by which immune-related cells and proteins might relate to or influence AD pathogenesis and progression are unclear.6 Specifically, while reductions in brain volume have been linked with inflammation and AD-related pathology7, 8, the observation that dysregulation in immune protein markers are evident early in the AD pathological cascade and are associated with worse cognitive performance in older adults without AD symptoms suggests that there are likely immune-related microstructural alterations that presage widespread volumetric atrophy.

Microstructural changes in the brain network associated with AD may offer key insights into early and potentially reversible areas of anatomic change in aging adults. Specifically, it has long been known from autopsy studies that AD is associated with marked alterations in neuronal dendrites and axons in the brain (henceforth referred to as ‘neurites’)9, 10, with early grey matter changes characterized by regression and reduced complexity of dendritic arbors in the neocortex. Animal models of aging further indicate that abnormal dendritic spine structures markedly impacts synaptic function and is a direct mediator of cognitive dysfunction.11 Neuroimaging techniques of grey matter in AD have primarily focused on grey matter atrophy in medial temporal lobe structures. However, not only are these neuroanatomical correlates not specific to AD12, 13, but these macrostructural atrophy patterns become notable only later in the disease process – after there is significant neuronal loss. Recent advances in diffusion imaging demonstrate that multi-shell diffusion methodologies, namely neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), can be applied in vivo, allowing for an assessment of the complexity of neurites in the neocortex. The benefit of NODDI over traditional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study designs is multifactorial, including: a) the ability to model and study diffusion signal in grey matter, not only white matter (to which traditional DTI has been applied); b) the assessment of both neuritic density and dispersion; and c) the minimization of partial volume effects (i.e., reduced likelihood of contamination of diffusion signal from neighboring cerebrospinal fluid) by parceling out and controlling for the respective roles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), axons, dendrites, and neurons.14 The paper first introducing NODDI described applications to white matter and grey matter and assumptions regarding model fitting15. Subsequent papers have further optimized original NODDI parameters to improve accuracy of modeling specific to grey matter.16–18

Prior animal studies suggest that non-neuronal, immune-related cells (i.e., microglia, astrocytes) and proteins are proximally associated with neuritic microstructure. Astrocytes directly interact with neuritic processes to maintain homeostatic functions and react to pathological stimuli.19, 20 While spatially restricted in movement21, astrocytes are part of the neurovascular unit and are extensively located throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Relevant to the putative relationship between immune cells and neuritic microstructure, astrocytes play a critically important role in pruning synapses and maintaining connections between presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines.22 In response to pathology and/or immune cell activation, they undergo a process referred to as astrogliosis and have been shown to overexpress glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).23 Astrogliosis, as measured by plasma GFAP levels, has been linked with AD processes and cognitive impairment, although the exact neuroanatomic mechanisms in humans are unknown.24–28 Our laboratory recently demonstrated that higher levels of GFAP are correlated with worse memory performance and lower white matter fractional anisotropy, even after accounting for APOE allele status and plasma markers of amyloid and tau, suggesting that astrogliosis and immune dysregulation more broadly may be an independent correlate and potentially a contributor to cognitive decline in late life29. Moreover, compelling recent data indicate that higher levels of GFAP predict future dementia status28, dynamically change early in the AD process26, and are elevated in cognitively unimpaired individuals who exhibit low Aβ1–42 levels in plasma, a marker of preclinical AD27.

Collectively, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that immune dysregulation is associated with AD pathology and clinical outcomes, that neurites are impacted early in the AD pathological cascade, and that dysfunction in astrocytes and inflammation may have a pivotal role in facilitating dendritic damage. In tandem, recent evidence suggests that immune dysregulation may be more pronounced in females30, 31, which has been recently proffered as a potential mechanistic explanation for the observed sex differences in AD prevalence and progression.32 A comprehensive assessment of the relationship between glial and immune dysregulation, AD-related pathology and grey matter neuritic microstructure in AD-vulnerable regions has yet to be conducted in aging adults, nor have studies addressed the potential of sex-specific modifying effects on the relationship between glial biology and grey matter neuritic microstructure in older adults.

To better understand potential pathways for immune-related cognitive and neuro-structural decline in late life, we evaluated the association between immune-related protein markers and in vivo neuroimaging indices of neuritic density (NDI) and orientation dispersion (ODI) in grey matter brain regions vulnerable to AD pathological processes. We also appraised risk markers of vascular damage in tandem with immune biomarkers, given known vascular conduits for glial- and immune-associated dysfunction and considering the role of astrocytes in maintaining homeostasis of the neurovascular unit.33 We hypothesized that higher levels of immune-related markers would be associated with reduced density and reduced complexity/dispersion of grey matter neurites in late life. Given the burgeoning literature linking protein markers of astrogliosis to negative clinical outcomes in both asymptomatic and symptomatic AD older adults, we expected that higher levels of GFAP would be the most robust indicator of reduced neuritic complexity in our cohort when evaluated in tandem with other immune-related and vascular markers. We also appraised whether significant associations between these immune-related markers and grey matter neuritic microstructure were modified by APOE4 status and plasma markers of AD-related pathology (i.e., Aβ 42/40) and neurodegeneration (i.e., tau, neurofilament light). Given prior evidence of sex-based differences in both immune biology and AD risk, we included sex as a potential moderator in primary analyses.

2. Methods and Procedures:

2.1 Participants:

A participant sample of 109 (out of 114) healthy older adults and adults with symptomatic AD were identified from the University of Colorado Alzheimer’s and Cognition Center (CUACC) Bio-AD study database (see Table 1) based on the availability of measured plasma biomarkers and complete neuroimaging data. A total of 114 participants had plasma biomarkers measured; of the 5 participants who did not have complete neuroimaging sequences, 2 had no MRI data at the corresponding biomarker timepoint, 1 had significant motion degraded T1, 1 scan failed FreeSurfer parcellation due to artifacts, and 1 had incomplete diffusion MRI. All participants were enrolled in the Bio-AD study, which is a study of aging and AD that involves comprehensive cognitive testing (results with GFAP described in prior study29), health history assessment, phlebotomy, neurological and physical examination, neuroimaging, and informant interview of all participants (i.e., Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, CDR) (described previously29, 34). Participants were included as healthy controls (n=68; henceforth referred to as “asymptomatic” for AD) if they were community dwelling older adults with no diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, and no evidence of a neurodegenerative phenotype based on a neurological exam. Symptomatic participants were referred to the study by providers at the University of Colorado Hospital Memory Disorders Clinic. Adjudication of MCI due to possible AD and AD dementia was based on NIA-AA clinical criteria (n=41)35, 36 during an interdisciplinary consensus conference (described below). Participants were excluded if they had a major psychiatric disorder, current non-AD neurological condition known to affect cognition (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, multiple sclerosis, large vessel infarct, history in the past two years of a focal brain lesion, current substance abuse/dependence, significant systemic medical illness or active neoplastic disease, significant sensory or motor deficits that would interfere with cognitive testing, or previous traumatic brain injury in the past 5 years with loss of consciousness greater than five minutes. Participants were included across the disease spectrum (i.e., asymptomatic to symptomatic) to enrich for heterogeneity in both biomarker and neuroimaging variables.

All participants were reviewed at an interdisciplinary consensus conference with a board-certified neuropsychologist, board-certified behavioral neurologists, advanced practice provider, and clinical research coordinators. All participants signed an informed consent approved by the University of Colorado (CU) Multiple Institutional Review Board. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at CU Anschutz Medical Campus37.

2.2 Neuroimaging:

Brain MRI was obtained on a 3.0 Tesla Siemens (Iselin, NJ) Skyra instrument equipped with a 20-channel head coil. Diffusion imaging data were acquired utilizing multi-shell 2D echo planar imaging sequence with 32-direction diffusion gradient at b=700 s/mm2 and 64-direction gradient at b=2500 s/mm2 (TR/TE = 8400 ms/105 ms; 2 × 2 × 2 mm3 isotropic spatial resolution; 112 × 112 acquisition matrix, 56 slices per volume). At the beginning, middle, and end of the diffusion protocol, b=0 s/mm2 volumes were obtained with reversed polarity phase-encoding (18 total b=0 volumes were obtained, 9 with anterior-posterior phase-encoding and 9 with posterior-anterior phase-encoding). T1-weighted structural images were acquired using two 3D inversion recovery prepared rapid gradient-echo MPRAGE sequence (TI=900 ms; TR/TE=2300 ms/2.88 ms; 1 × 1 ×1 mm3 isotropic voxel resolution; 248 × 256 acquisition matrix). Each 3D T1 volume was visually inspected for motion and adequate brain coverage.

Diffusion-weighted b=0 images with opposed phase-encoding were utilized to correct for susceptibility effects utilizing the FSL (v 5.0) topup tool38, 39, and then all diffusion data were corrected for motion and eddy-currents utilizing the eddy tool40. The Brain Extraction Tool in FSL was utilized to create a brain mask for each subject and visually inspected to ensure quality control. NDI, ODI, and CSF volume fraction parameter maps were generated by fitting the model for NODDI in MATLAB (R2021A) utilizing the NODDI MATLAB toolbox (v 1.0.5, UCL Microstructure Imaging Group)15. The MakeModel script within the toolbox was specifically modified to utilize an intracellular intrinsic parallel diffusivity parameter (d∥) of 1.1 × 10−3 mm2/s to improve fit in grey matter.16

Cortical segmentation of T1-weighted structural images was performed utilizing the recon-all command in FreeSurfer (v. 7.1.0) ), applied to the 3D T1 volume with the least motion. FreeSurfer parcellation and segmentation data was visually inspected for accuracy and minimal manual edits were required for the 109 subjects included in the study. Cortical thickness was extracted and tabulated for each participant utilizing regions-of-interest derived from the Desikan-Killiany atlas41; cortical thickness measures were extracted to determine whether biomarker associations with grey matter neuritic microstructure were independent of atrophy. Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of NDI and ODI data was performed by registering individual subject Desikan atlas cortical segmentation onto diffusion parameter maps generated from the NODDI MATLAB toolbox. Registration was performed utilizing the FLIRT and FNIRT tools in FSL for affine registration. All analyses of diffusion data in grey matter were performed in subject space to minimize partial volume effects which could result from transforming data into atlas space.

For primary analysis, we created one primary combined grey matter region of interest (henceforth referred to as AD Vulnerable ROI) from individual Desikan atlas derived ROIs known to be vulnerable to AD pathology. NODDI biomarker values from the AD-vulnerable ROI were obtained by averaging the NODDI metric of interest (ODI, NDI) across several smaller ROIs, weighted by the relative size (in number of voxels) of each to account for variability in ROI size. The following regions were included in the AD Vulnerable ROI based on prior studies: inferior parietal, middle temporal, inferior temporal, precuneus, fusiform, and entorhinal ROIs.42, 43. Prior studies have specifically recommended this meta ROI as an accurate and reliable neuroimaging indicator of disease severity 43 It was created separately for grey matter ODI and NDI, as well as for cortical thickness.

Given that more diffuse associations between biomarkers and neuroimaging outcomes are possible, we also created a whole brain grey matter ROI for NDI, ODI, and cortical thickness as comparator regions to assess specificity of our findings to AD vulnerable regions. Specifically, to minimize overlap in ROIs between the target AD vulnerable brain region and whole brain, we used a regression-based approach to remove the effect of the target AD vulnerable ROI on the whole brain. The whole brain ROI thus represents whole brain metrics residualized for the effects of the AD vulnerable ROI. Finally, we utilized the primary motor cortex as a control region given consistent documentation of its relative sparing in early to moderate stages of AD.44–47

2.3 Blood Collection and Biomarker Ascertainment:

After collection, each whole blood sample was centrifuged at 1500× g for 15 min at 22°C and the plasma was removed. Plasma was centrifuged at 2200× g for 10 min at 4°C to remove any residual cells, decanted and stored at −80°C. Blood-based biomarkers were selected based on standard and well-validated assays of AD-related pathology, inflammation, and vascular dysfunction. Of note, while CSF remains the gold standard for most fluid biomarkers (see additional references6, 26 for review), compelling evidence suggests that blood-based biomarkers are associated with clinical outcomes in aging adults and adults with AD26, 48–50; moreover, plasma GFAP has been demonstrated to show stronger associations with AD-related pathology than CSF GFAP levels.51

Protein analysis of GFAP and canonical biomarkers of brain amyloid (Aβ42; Aβ40) and neurodegeneration (NfL, total tau) were measured with the Quanterix single molecule array, (SIMOA®), SR-X Analyzer system using manufacturer-supplied antibody kits. Nominal recovery for control levels remained between 111–120% with a coefficient of variation (CV) &lt;10%. GFAP and NfL levels were available for all study participants (n=109); Aβ42, Aβ40, and total tau levels were available for 100 (Aβ) and 99 (tau) participants, respectively. We further computed the intra-individual CV utilizing the two runs for each participant and each biomarker. We restricted the analyses to biomarkers wherein the intra-individual CV was ≤ 20% (Final sample size: GFAP=109; Aβ42/40 =100; Total Tau = 99; NfL=109).

Analysis of additional immune markers were measured using the Human Chemokine Panel 1 V-PLEX Plus kit (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD), which included MCP-1, MCP-4, IL-8, Eotaxin, Eotaxin-3, MIP-1β, MIP-1 alpha, IP-10, TARC and MDC. We elected to focus on this chemokine panel for an indicator of the peripheral inflammatory state, as strong evidence supports the role of these chemoattractant cytokines in mediating aspects of the inflammatory response, modulating the migration of monocytes, and influencing negative cognitive outcomes in late life.4, 27, 52–54 Given a) associations between inflammation, vascular endothelial alterations, and gliosis, and b) that astrocytes play a critical role in neurovascular coupling22, we also analyzed acute inflammatory and vascular adhesion markers using the Vascular Injury Panel V-PLEX kit, which included CRP, ICAM-1, SAA, and VCAM-1. Each array was scanned using a MESO QuickPlex SQ 120. Manufacturer supplied software (Discover Workbench 4.0) was used to quantify the concentration.

2.4 APOE Genotyping:

APOE ε4 genotype was performed on buffy coat samples of all participants. DNA was genotyped using a rapid allele-specific PCR methodology, adapted to Real Time PCR monitored by TaqMan probe [see full description55]. Participants were categorized using a binary variable as an APOE ε4 carrier or non-carrier.

2.5 Statistical Analysis:

Demographic, neuroimaging, and biomarker summary measures (mean, sd) were computed for asymptomatic and symptomatic participants (Table 1). Although not the primary focus of this analysis, statistical comparisons between the asymptomatic and symptomatic were also statistically tested using t-tests and chi-sq, as appropriate (Supplemental Table 1). ICAM1, SAA, and CRP were log (base 10) transformed prior to analysis given a strong right tailed distribution. Distributional assumptions (normality) and linearity of associations were assessed with scatter plots and outliers identified using a Cook’s D &gt;1.0. Only three observations, all in different biomarkers, were removed from analysis. A complete case analysis was done for each model.

To examine whether plasma biomarkers of inflammation were related to NODDI outcomes, univariable linear regression models were fitted to assess associations between each individual biomarker and each individual NODDI measure (AD Vulnerable ODI and NDI) and the ODI and NDI comparator region (whole brain residual) and control region (primary motor cortex). A Bonferroni adjustment using 18 comparisons (p&lt;0.0028) was used to declare statistical significance. Given this is a conservative adjustment, we also computed q-values (FDR corrected p-values).

To understand the importance of the biomarker associations in the presence of the other biomarkers, two complementary analytic approaches were used. A backward elimination approach was used with a p&lt;0.15/18=0.00833 to retain a variable in the analysis. Age, sex, and education were forced to remain in all models. In a second, separate sensitivity analysis, lasso56 (glmnet v4.1–7) was used for model selection57 and a stability selection approach was used for post-selection inference (hdi v0.010)]58. For the lasso, 10-fold generalized cross validation (GCV) was used to select the penalty parameter. For the GCV, the training data were 2/3 of the sample with the test data the other 1/3. The penalty parameter was identified as value that minimizes the mean cross-validation error. For the stability selection, the EV threshold was set to 2. This analysis framework was performed separately on each of the NODDI outcomes and comparator and control regions. For full backward elimination and lasso a complete dataset is needed. Multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE v3.15.0) was used59. All biomarkers and the AD Vulnerable ODI and NDI regions along with age, sex, and education were used in the imputation models. A single imputation was performed because adopting multiple imputation in lasso and the stability selection approaches has not been developed in the packages.

For the final models obtained by backward selection, mixed effects models with a random intercept were used to formally assess whether the biomarker effects were similar between the comparator and NODDI regions and the control and NODDI regions.

To assess whether the associations between the plasma biomarkers and NODDI outcomes were modified by clinical symptoms and AD-related markers, we included interactions with symptom status, global CDR, amyloid status (ratio of Aβ42/Ab40), or APOE E4 status in the final models selected with backward selection. These interactions were only created with the biomarkers in the final models identified above (one model for each outcome). Models were adjusted for age, sex, and education. We interpreted coefficients and confidence intervals for p-values &lt;0.00833 given the lower power expected with interaction hypotheses. We evaluated each interaction separately. Also, given literature on sex-based differences in immune responses, we included an interaction with sex in a separate model for ODI.

To understand whether the plasma biomarker associations with NODDI metrics were confounded by cortical thickness, we adjusted the final results in the model by adding cortical thickness to the final regression model.17, 42 We quantified the change in the regression coefficient after adjustment and whether the plasma biomarker associations with NODDI outcomes remained statistically significant. Due to our concerns that the confounding effect could be different for asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, we repeated the cortical thickness adjustment stratified by symptom status. This was an exploratory analysis and the patterns and raw p-values were presented.

To understand which regions of the large AD vulnerable ROI may be contributing to the primary findings, we repeated the univariable and model selection analyses on each of the six regions that comprised the AD vulnerable region for ODI and NDI. R version 4.2.3 was used for all statistical analysis.

3. Results

Participants were on average 70 (SD=7) years old, with 44% of individuals having at least one APOE E4 allele. Females comprised 63.3% of the sample. A heatmap of correlations between the plasma biomarkers is in Figure 1. The pairwise correlations between the biomarkers were modest.

3.1 Relationship between Plasma Biomarkers and NODDI Indices of Neuritic Dispersion and Density (Supplemental Table 2; Figure 2):

When examining each plasma marker individually, only higher levels of GFAP were significantly associated with lower ODI in the AD Vulnerable ROI (p=0.0018, q=0.035). Associations were noted between AD-related biomarkers (i.e., NfL) and ODI in the AD Vulnerable ROI; however, these associations did not remain significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. No immune-related, AD-related, or vascular biomarkers were associated with NDI (p&gt;0.041; q&gt;0.42).

After backward selection, only plasma levels of GFAP remained in the model for AD Vulnerable ODI (p = 0.0018; Coeff = −3.4×e−03, SE = 1.1×e−03). Note, since there is only one biomarker, this is the same model as the univariable model describe above. GFAP was also selected in the lasso and stability selection procedures. Consistent with the univariable results, no biomarkers were significantly associated with the AD Vulnerable NDI regions after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

3.2 Relationship between Plasma Biomarkers and Comparator and Control Regions (Table 2)

In univariable analyses, no statistically significant associations were found between any biomarkers and either the comparator or control regions (p&gt;0.0040; q&gt;0.064) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. The smallest p-value observed for comparator regions was for an association between plasma GFAP and the ODI comparator region (Coeff=−1.7×e−03, SE=5.7×e−04). Specifically, only plasma GFAP was retained in backward selection, but it was not significant after Bonferroni adjustment (p=0.0040). Note, this model is the same as the univariable model. When comparing the effect of plasma GFAP in the ODI comparator region to the effect in AD Vulnerable ODI (Table 2), the associations between plasma GFAP and AD Vulnerable ODI was 2.33 times larger than the association between GFAP and the comparator region (p&lt;0.025; Coeff AD ODI=−3.5×e−03;Coeff Comparator=−1.5×e−03).

The smallest p-value observed for the ODI and NDI control regions was for an association between MCP-1 and the ODI control region (p=0.025; Coeff=−2.5×e−02, SE=1.1×e−02), which was not considered significant after Bonferroni adjustment. There was no significant association between plasma GFAP and the ODI control region (p&gt;0.49; Coeff=−1.2×e−03, SE=1.7×e−03). We also compared the effects of plasma GFAP between the ODI control region and AD Vulnerable ODI. The GFAP-AD Vulnerable ODI association was 2 times larger than the association between GFAP and the control region.

3.3 Role of AD-Related Pathology, Symptom Status, and APOE in Modifying Associations between Immune Biomarkers and Neuritic Outcomes (Table 3)

To assess whether the associations between immune biomarkers and neuritic outcomes were influenced – or modified – by clinical severity, AD-related pathology, and APOE status, we conducted separate analyses for the primary immune-related markers extracted from the backward elimination models (i.e., ODI: GFAP) and included an interaction term with the following: symptom status (i.e., asymptomatic vs symptomatic for AD), CDR global rating, presence or absence of at least one APOE E4 allele, and the ratio of Aβ42/40. The statistical effects of plasma GFAP levels on the AD Vulnerable ROI were not significantly impacted by any of these disease or clinical status variables (p&gt;0.25).

3.4 Role of Sex in Modifying Associations between Immune Biomarkers and Neuritic Outcomes (Table 3; Figure 3)

As noted, in the final models, GFAP was the primary, independent predictor of ODI in the AD Vulnerable ROI. There were no observed sex differences in GFAP levels (p=0.536) or ODI (p=0.178). Sex influenced the association between GFAP levels and AD Vulnerable ODI (p&lt;0.0038), such that the negative association was only observed in females.

3.5 Biomarkers Associations with NODDI Metrics After Controlling for Cortical Thickness (Table 4):

To determine whether the associations between immune-related biomarkers and NODDI metrics were independent of gross morphological changes (i.e., independent of atrophy), we further assessed whether controlling for cortical thickness altered the results of our primary analyses. Of note, the association between higher levels of plasma GFAP and lower AD Vulnerable ODI was accounted for by cortical thickness (p=0.61). After adjustment for cortical thickness, the association between plasma GFAP and AD Vulnerable ROI ODI was reduced from a coefficient of −3.3×e−03 to −6.3×e−04 for a 100 unit increase in plasma GFAP.

To further explicate why this NODDI metric diverged with respect to cortical thickness, we examined the bivariate correlations between the neuroimaging metrics. Importantly, AD Vulnerable cortical thickness is moderately and positively correlated with ODI (R=0.44). In addition, AD Vulnerable ROI cortical thickness was moderately negatively correlated with plasma GFAP (R=−0.55). In contrast, AD Vulnerable ROI cortical thickness was not correlated with AD Vulnerable NDI (R=−0.015).

Given that our participant sample included both asymptomatic (i.e., healthy controls) and symptomatic (i.e., MCI and dementia levels of severity due to AD) individuals, we also explored whether the effect of cortical thickness on GFAP-NODDI associations differed as a function of symptom status. First, the association between cortical thickness and AD Vulnerable ODI is modified by symptom status (p=0.0045). The association is attenuated for symptomatic compared to asymptomatic [Coeff = 7.0×e−02 (SE=2.0×e−02) symptomatic vs 6.1×e−03 (SE=1.6×e−02) for asymptomatic]. The difference in the effect of cortical thickness on AD Vulnerable ODI results in different amounts of confounding of the GFAP-ODI relationship finding for asymptomatic vs. symptomatic. Based on a stratified analysis (Table 4), when considering only symptomatic participants, the association between GFAP levels and the AD Vulnerable ODI is not significant prior to adjustment for cortical thickness (p=0.73). The sign of the effect becomes positive after adjustment but is still not significant (p=0.17). When considering only asymptomatic participants, the association between GFAP levels and the AD Vulnerable ODI is the same size and direction as the overall analysis. Adjustment for cortical thickness has no effect on the relationship between GFAP levels and the AD Vulnerable ROI (p=0.038); specifically, the association between GFAP levels and AD vulnerable ODI is unchanged from a coefficient of −0.0038 (SE=0.0017) to −0.0037 (SE=0.0020) for a 100 unit increase in GFAP.

3.6 Evaluation of Immune and NODDI Metrics in the Six Subregions Comprising the AD Vulnerable ROI (Tables 5 and 6 for ODI; Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 for NDI)

The univariable results for the individual sub-region ROIs are broadly supportive of the primary GFAP findings. In the univariable analyses, plasma GFAP had the minimum p-value of the immune biomarkers for all regions except the entorhinal subregion, for which MCP-1 had the lowest raw p-value (p=0.089). After multiple comparison adjustment the GFAP association is significantly negatively associated with AD Vulnerable ODI for the middle temporal (p=0.0013; q=0.024) and marginally negatively associated with AD Vulnerable ODI for the fusiform (p=0.0095; q=0.074). Several associations were noted for AD-related biomarkers and vascular biomarkers with ODI outcomes, but they were not considered significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (note that all raw p-values are presented in Tables 5 and 6 for ODI, and in Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 for NDI). The findings for NDI remain consistent with no significant associations between the biomarkers and AD vulnerable NDI after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

4. Discussion

We examined a panel of immune, vascular injury, and AD-related biomarkers to elucidate their associations with grey matter neuritic microstructure in AD vulnerable regions in a cohort of healthy older adults and adults with symptoms of AD. When simultaneously examining all markers, higher plasma GFAP levels were the only significant immune-related predictor of lower ODI, a measure which attempts to quantify dispersion of grey matter neuritic structure and is a proxy for synaptic complexity. Using a conservating multiple comparison correction, no AD-related or vascular injury plasma biomarkers were associated with ODI when considering the entire panel of biomarkers in tandem, and no biomarkers were significantly associated with NDI metrics. Associations between biomarkers and neuritic microstructure were not significantly impacted by symptom status or plasma Aβ42/40 ratio; however, there was a large sex effect observed, wherein negative associations between GFAP and ODI were only observed in females. Collectively, this study provides the first concurrent appraisal of immune, vascular, and AD-related biomarkers in the context of advanced grey matter neurite orientation and dispersion methodology, and it suggests that sex may be an important modifier of the complex associations between astrogliosis, immune dysregulation, and brain microstructure in older adults.

Inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and AD pathology are all posited to play roles in early degenerative pathophysiological cascades. Results from our study suggest that higher levels of GFAP, a marker for astrogliosis, are associated with lower dispersion and complexity of grey matter neurites in brain regions vulnerable to AD; importantly, blood GFAP levels were the most robust predictor of this neuritic outcome, as no AD-related or vascular biomarkers were significantly associated with the dispersion/orientation metric after accounting for GFAP. This result supports a growing body of evidence indicating that GFAP may be a critical indicator of astrocyte reactivity or dysfunction early in the AD course26, 28, 29, and further extends the literature by showing that higher levels of astrogliosis may have downstream effects associated with altered complexity of dendritic microstructure in the brain. Considering these findings from a broader mechanistic lens, astrocytes interact with dendritic processes by stabilizing connections between presynaptic terminals and dendritic spines,22 the latter of which are the primary post-synaptic contact site for glutamatergic innervation and together, the neuron-glia interface forms the tripartite synapse.60, 61 Human autopsy studies have consistently reported that the aging brain is associated with a regression and reduced complexity of these dendritic arbors in the neocortex62, 63, which has been postulated to be a likely early structural mechanism for cognitive decline. Moreover, animal studies have demonstrated age-associated transcriptional alterations in astrocytes that are consistent with a reactive phenotype.64 In the context of a cross-sectional study, temporal relationships between the biomarkers and neuroimaging cannot be determined; however, salient to the question of whether elevations in GFAP may represent early pathological cascades prior to gross morphological atrophy, exploratory analyses demonstrated that associations between GFAP and grey matter orientation/dispersion were independent of cortical thickness only in the asymptomatic cohort. At the stage of MCI and dementia level of severity, cortical thickness became the primary driver of the association, suggesting that markers of astrogliosis may provide the strongest window into microstructural changes during typical/normal aging. Determining whether these alterations in astrogliosis with age are catalysts for future AD-related change or if they interact with other mechanisms in asymptomatic older adults is an important area of future research.

Results from our study indicate that negative associations between GFAP and grey matter ODI are observed only in females. This finding supports a growing body of literature demonstrating sex effects30–32, 65 on a range of immune markers, cells, and function, and further highlights that stratification of results by sex is integral to developing a comprehensive conceptual framework for immune dysfunction in AD. In the absence of longitudinal data, it is unclear how the negative association between GFAP and neuritic microstructure may relate to either risk or course in females; however, it is important to consider that females are at greater risk for AD32, display higher tau burden and higher levels of plasma p-tau66, and have faster progression of the syndrome - particularly E4 carriers - after diagnosis for yet to be determined reasons. When considering possible sex-based contributions to differential AD risk, there are noted differences in basal/physiological neuroimmune function30, microglial activation67, immune response to infections,65 and immune-related risk gene variants.31 Collectively, these studies underscore that the disproportionate risk and deleterious outcomes noted in females may be influenced in part by immune-mediated causes, but there is a dire need for prospective, longitudinal studies that examine sex-based differences in the contribution of the immune system (and the vascular system) to AD pathogenesis and decline.

When interpreting the results of the current study, an important consideration is that all biomarkers were measured in blood. While blood-based inflammatory and vascular markers may be broadly seen to reflect peripheral or systemic inflammation and vascular dysfunction6, the relative contribution of CNS-related factors to peripheral biomarker levels is unclear. Although identifying specific biomarker categories as being more or less reflective of the peripheral milieu is speculative, there is a growing body of literature that suggests blood-based GFAP should originate in the CNS. It is notable that recent studies suggest stronger associations between GFAP and clinical outcomes in blood compared to CSF, and it is currently the only CNS-derived blood marker that shows this pattern26, 51, 68. Hypotheses have been raised as to whether the robust levels of GFAP measured in plasma are due to astrocytic end feet forming and structurally supporting the blood-brain barrier, as this process may provide a direct conduit for GFAP to be released into the bloodstream. In line with this question, given that GFAP is a filament protein that stabilizes astrocyte arborization, it is possible that high levels in blood reflect astrocyte damage. Other possible reasons for the stronger effects in blood compared to CSF are differential protein degradation rates in CSF vs plasma51. The derivation of this finding is critical not only to understanding the origin of these astrocytic biomarkers but also to explicating potential crosstalk between the systems and elucidating points of possible intervention. Astrocytes are critically involved in many other homeostatic functions; thus, while we have examined GFAP as an immune-related protein indicator, it is possible that its relationship with neuritic microstructure is influenced by other intermediate processes or functions and not solely inflammation - particularly in light of the modest associations between neuritic microstructure and other chemokine markers that did not reach significance upon adjustment for multiple comparisons. In sum, while we cannot address CNS inflammation or astrocyte-mediated inflammation in the current study, the results suggest potentially different roles of peripheral chemokines and astrocytic alteration in neuritic microstructural brain aging.

The current study has numerous strengths, including the simultaneous appraisal of immune, vascular, and AD-related biomarker panels and the evaluation of neuritic microstructure in a well-characterized group of older adults. We also utilized several analytic approaches to confirm the robustness of the results. There are several limitations to interpretation that should be noted. Our hypothesis was that GFAP would be a strong correlate of neuritic microstructure in older adults; however, we utilized an agnostic approach to model building and therefore included a larger number of biomarkers. We used a conservative Bonferroni approach with 18 comparisons. Employing this conservative threshold may result in missing some important and relevant findings, as some associations would otherwise be deemed significant (e.g., NfL and AD vulnerable ROI) in the univariable analyses with a more liberal p-value. We point the reader to the primary and supplementary tables, which contain the unadjusted p-values, to make their own level of adjustment and aid in interpretation for future, large replication studies. Nonetheless, it is particularly striking that associations between GFAP and the AD Vulnerable ODI remained after accounting for multiple comparisons as well as accounting for AD-related and vascular biomarkers. Given the cross-sectional, observational study design, we also cannot infer a specific mechanism based on the associations described. There is a burgeoning literature showing that higher levels of some immune markers may represent an adaptive response to pathology, depending upon the stage of disease6, 69, 70. Future studies should evaluate whether associations between immune markers and neuritic microstructure are adaptive (i.e., leveraging beneficial processes to remove AD pathology) versus maladaptive (i.e., displaying dysregulated responses that propagate disease) as a function of A/T/N71 pathological status and symptom presentation. This cannot be accomplished through cross-sectional studies, but instead will necessitate complementary information from prospective longitudinal studies, mechanistic animal studies, and ultimately, interventional trials. Future studies focused on neuroanatomical mechanisms associated with GFAP specifically should also consider longitudinal, voxel-wise whole brain analyses. Finally, as noted previously, there are remaining questions regarding the underlying biological contributions to NODDI metrics. The NODDI model ultimately represents a balance between greater complexity of in vivo microstructural assessment (compared to traditional fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity measures with DTI) and simplicity of acquisition within a clinically feasible timeframe.

In summary, results from our study indicate that higher level of blood GFAP are related to lower neuritic complexity in grey matter, even after accounting for other immune-related, vascular, and AD pathology markers. This negative association was primarily observed in females. This study adds to a growing body of literature linking elevations in blood GFAP to deleterious outcomes and further underscores that biological pathways associated with astrogliosis may be linked with alterations in neuritic complexity and density in late life.

Highlights – Thaker et al manuscript

Higher blood GFAP is associated with lower neurite dispersion in grey matter.

Dispersion and complexity of neurites may be influenced by late life astrogliosis.

egative links between GFAP and neurite complexity are observed mainly in females.
