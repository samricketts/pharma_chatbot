INTRODUCTION:

To determine the role of vitamin D intake on cognitive decline among Blacks and Whites.

METHODS:

Utilizing data from the population-based Chicago Health and Aging Project, we studied 2,061 Blacks and 1,329 Whites with dietary vitamin D data and cognitive testing over 12 years of follow-up. Multivariable linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the association of vitamin D intake with cognitive decline.

RESULTS:

Vitamin D intake, particularly dietary vitamin D, was associated with a slower rate of decline in cognitive function among Blacks. In Blacks, comparing individuals in the lowest tertile of dietary intake, those in the highest tertile had a slower cognitive decline of 0.017 units/year (95%CI 0.006, 0.027), independently of supplementation use. In Whites, vitamin D intake was not associated with cognitive decline.

DISCUSSION:

Dietary vitamin D may help to slow the decline in cognitive abilities among Blacks as they age.


pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s dementia, characterized by a progressive decline in memory and other cognitive abilities, is one of the most feared conditions of aging [1,2]. While aging is a natural process of human life and longevity is the highest achievement of modern society, maintaining a healthy brain as we age has become an increasing concern for the general public [3]. Consequently, it is very much in the public’s interest to identify effective strategies for preventing loss of cognition or dementia in a growing aging population [4]. Among several identified risk factors for dementia [5–7], nutrition has gained public interest because it can be readily modified [8,9]. However, evidence-based dietary guidance is limited, and perhaps falsely leads the general public to the overconsumption of supplements for preventing Alzheimer’s dementia [10]. Specifically, vitamin D supplementation has received considerable interest in dementia research because the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is higher among older adults [11–13], particularly among minorities, such as Blacks [14], and cognitively impaired individuals [15,16]. In addition to vitamin D deficiency, Blacks have a higher prevalence of apolipoprotein E ϵ4 allele (APOE ε4), an established risk factor of dementia [17], which plays an essential role as a modulator of vitamin D status [18,19]; that is, APOE ε4 allele may protect against vitamin D deficiency [18].

We prospectively examined the association of vitamin D intake, from both diet and supplements, with cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites. We also sought to investigate the role of vitamin D intake on the relationship between APOE ε4 and cognitive decline.

Methods

Study design, settings, and population

The current investigation is embedded within the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP), a longitudinal population-based study investigating risk factors for cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s dementia in Blacks and Whites. CHAP began in 1993 with the enrollment of 6,157 individuals (78.7% of all residents) in the original cohort through a door-to-door census. In subsequent years, residents (n=4,645) who reached 65 years of age were enrolled in successive age cohorts. Ten thousand eight hundred two participants were enrolled in CHAP from 1993 to 2012 and comprised the study population. Data collection occurred in 3-year cycles through in-home assessments for a wide range of social and clinical phenotypes, including lifestyle factors, medical history, genotyping, and cognitive performance. The details of the CHAP study design have been described previously [20]. The CHAP study has current approval by the Rush University Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided informed consent.

Our investigation focuses primarily on participants enrolled in the dietary study. The dietary study began a few years after the initiation of the original cohort and invited all participants to self-administer a 144-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and from all available individuals over the study period, 7,020 returned the FFQ and 6,997 with valid nutrition data. We excluded participants (n=1,989) who had no cognitive assessment after returning the FFQ (e.g., no follow-up cognitive data). Next, we excluded participants (n=23) who reported race other than Blacks or Whites, had no data on APOE ε4 genotyping (n=1,513), and with missing data on body mass index (n=80) and covariates (n=2). After these exclusions, 2,061 Blacks and 1,329 Whites composed our study population. Among participants who returned the FFQs, those included in our investigation were younger (71.7y vs. 73.4y), more women (63.6% vs. 59.4%), and fewer Blacks (60.8% vs. 64.7%). Also, these participants had a higher cognitive score (z score 0.38 vs. −0.09) at the current study baseline, suggesting that cognitive abilities did not influence the response to the FFQ in the study sample.

Assessment of vitamin D intake

Vitamin D intake and supplementation use were determined based on responses to a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), a modified version of Harvard FFQ validated for use in older Chicago community residents [21]. Dietary vitamin D intake was computed by multiplying the frequency of consumption of each food and the vitamin D content of the specified portion. These foods items include milk and milk products, butter, margarine, liver and other meats, fish and seafood, eggs, and cold breakfast cereals. Supplemental vitamin D intake was based on the use of vitamin D supplements and vitamin D–containing multivitamin supplements. Nutrient composition of food items was based on the continually updated Harvard nutrient database. Total vitamin D intake was computed as the sum of dietary vitamin D coming from foods and supplements. Total vitamin D intake and dietary vitamin D were energy-adjusted by sex using the regression residuals method [22]. Total energy intake was computed by adding the energy intakes from all foods based on responses to the frequency of consumption of all the FFQ food items.

Demographics and health measures:

Nondietary variables were obtained from structured interview questions. Age (in years) was computed from the self-reported birth date and date of the first cognitive assessment in this analysis. Race/ethnicity and sex were self-reported using structured questions based on the 1990 US Census. Education was based on self-reported years of regular schooling. Body mass index [weight (kg)/height (m)2] was computed from measured weight and height. Self-reports of the presence of comorbidities, including heart disease, stroke, or diabetes, were obtained using the structured questions from the Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly. Physical activity was measured through a validated questionnaire from the 1985 U.S. Health Interview Survey that was adapted for use in older adults. Participants reported the time spent on activities, including walking for exercise, gardening or yard work, calisthenics or general exercise, bicycle riding, and swimming. Late-life cognitive activities were assessed with a structured questionnaire that gathered information on the typical time spent during a year on seven activities, including reading, writing letters, visiting a library, and playing games such as chess or checkers. The APOE genotypes were determined based on the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the rs7412 and rs429358 measured by the Broad Institute Center for Genotyping using the hME Sequenom MassARRAY platform [23,24]. We determined participants as APOE ε4 carriers if they had at least 1 ε4 allele (ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, or ε4/4) and as noncarriers, if they had no ε4 alleles.

Assessment of global cognitive function

Cognitive function was determined by using a battery of four neuropsychological tests, including two tests of episodic memory (immediate and delayed story recall) [25,26], a test of perceptual speed [27], and a test of general orientation and global cognition (the MMSE) [28]. Raw scores for each test were standardized (z-scores) using the mean and standard deviation of the population scores. The standardized scores were then averaged to create a composite z-score of global cognitive function. The standardization and averaging the individual tests reduces the floor and ceiling effects and other measurement errors between and within individuals. In a previous factor analysis conducted by CHAP investigators, these 4 tests loaded on a single factor which accounted for 74% of the variance [29]. Global cognition was computed on each study visit approximately 3 years apart, and we determined the rate of cognitive decline based on the cognitive performance (e.g., scoring) within individuals during the follow-up. On average, each individual included in our study provided 3 cognitive assessments over the study period.

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics of the Blacks and Whites are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD), median and interquartile range (IQR), or absolute number and percentages of participants. Linear mixed-effects models were used to determine the association between vitamin D intake and the rate of cognitive decline separately in Blacks and Whites. Models were adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE ε4, body mass index, late-life cognitive activities, physical activity, comorbidities (i.e., heart disease, stroke, and diabetes), total energy intake, and their respective interactions with follow-up time. The interaction term with time indicates the average association of vitamin D on the annual rate of change. We investigated both linear (log10-transformed Vitamin D intake modeled as a continuous variable) and non-linear (Vitamin D intake modeled in tertiles) associations of vitamin D intake with the rate of cognitive decline.

In addition to total vitamin D intake, we determined the independent contributions of vitamin D intake from foods and vitamin D intake from supplements in cognition. When we evaluated the role of dietary vitamin D intake with cognitive decline, we additionally adjusted for vitamin D supplements. Similarly, when we investigated the relationship between vitamin D supplement use and cognitive decline, we adjusted for dietary vitamin D intake.

We conducted a specific analysis to investigate whether vitamin D intake modifies the relationship between APOE ε4 and cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites. APOE ε4 allele differs by race (higher prevalence in Blacks), increases the risk of cognitive impairment as people age, and modulates the vitamin D status (may protect against vitamin D deficiency [18]). In this analysis, we focused simultaneously on the intake of Vitamin D and the presence of the APOE ε4 allele to create 6 groups of individuals: vitamin D intake in the first tertile and non-carrier of APOE ε4 allele; vitamin D intake in the second tertile and non-carrier of APOE ε4 allele; vitamin D intake in the third tertile and non-carrier of APOE ε4 allele; vitamin D intake in the first tertile and carrier of APOE ε4 allele; vitamin D intake in the second tertile and carrier of APOE ε4 allele; and vitamin D intake in the third tertile and carrier of APOE ε4 allele. Individuals in the first group (e.g., 1st tertile of vitamin D intake and non-carrier of APOE ε4 allele) formed the reference category.

We also conducted a series of interaction analyses evaluating the potential effect modifications in the estimated associations between vitamin D and cognitive decline. First, we evaluated the effect of modification by race, and after confirming a significant interaction term (P value &lt; 0.05), we proceeded with interaction analyses evaluating the effect modification by age, sex, education, body mass index, and APOE ε4 in the association of vitamin D and cognitive decline among Blacks and Whites. Lastly, recognizing the non-linear distribution of the MMSE score, as well as its interpretation in relation to cognitive decline, we excluded the MMSE score from the global cognition composite score and repeated our primary analysis.

All the analyses were performed with R software, CRAN version 4.0.0, and its packages (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics of Blacks and Whites are shown in Table 1. Blacks, on average, were 73 years old, 64% women, and had 12 years of schooling. 37.3% were APOE ε4 allele carriers. Daily vitamin D intake was 210 IU, and 32% were using vitamin D supplements, including vitamin D–containing multivitamins. The average age in Whites study participants was 75 years, 63% were women, and they reported 14.5 years of education. The APOE ε4 allele was present in 26.6% of Whites. Total vitamin D intake was 348 IU, and 46.6% were consuming vitamin D supplements or multivitamins containing vitamin D. Overall intake of vitamin D in our study is suboptimal, according to recommended dietary allowances for Vitamin D by the Institute of Medicine[30]. Demographic and clinical characteristics of by tertiles of total vitamin D intake are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

Table 2 presents the associations of total and dietary vitamin D intake with cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites. A higher vitamin D intake in Blacks was associated with a slower cognitive decline. Specifically, a one-unit increase in log10-transformed vitamin D was associated with a slower cognitive decline of 0.014 units/year [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.002, 0.026]. Compared to Black individuals in the lowest (1st) tertile, those in the highest (3rd) tertile experienced a slower cognitive decline by 0.013 units/year (95%CI 0.003, 0.024). Similar associations, but of larger magnitude, were observed between dietary intake of vitamin D and cognitive decline, in which we further adjusted for supplementation intake. A one-unit increase in log10-transformed dietary vitamin D in Blacks was associated with a slower cognitive decline of 0.026 units/year (95%CI 0.009, 0.043). Compared to participants in the lowest tertile of dietary vitamin D intake, those in the third tertile had a slower cognitive decline of 0.017 units/year (95%CI 0.006, 0.027). No associations were found in Whites for either total vitamin D intake or dietary vitamin D intake. Figure 1 graphically summarizes the association of vitamin D with cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites. It shows the predicted paths of change in global cognition for typical participants with vitamin D intake in 1st and 3rd tertile. We further investigated the relationship of vitamin D intake with cognitive decline separately in people who did and did not use vitamin D supplements, including vitamin D–containing multivitamins (Supplementary Table 2). We found that a higher vitamin D intake was associated with a slower cognitive decline only for Blacks non-supplement users (β 1-unit increase in log10 transformed was 0.033 and 95%CI 0.012, 0.054).

Table 3 shows the association of vitamin D intake from supplements with cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites. Individuals taking supplements were categorized into 3 groups (tertiles) according to the amount of vitamin D content in supplements. We categorized supplement users into tertiles to address the heterogeneity (46% of Whites were using supplements) and determine whether there is a linear association with cognitive decline by increasing intakes of vitamin D supplements (e.g., from 1st to 3rd tertiles). We found no significant association of vitamin D supplements with cognitive decline in Blacks and Whites across tertiles of vitamin D supplements compared to people who did not receive vitamin D supplements. Comparing individuals in the highest (3rd) tertile of vitamin D from supplements versus no supplement users β (95%CI) in Blacks was −0.005 (95%CI −0.019, 0.009) and in Whites was −0.011 (95%CI −0.027, 0.005). Furthermore, there was no presence of a linear trend in these associations across tertiles of vitamin D supplements.

Figure 2 shows the association of the joint combination of APOE ε4 status and vitamin D intake (total and dietary tertiles) with cognitive decline. In Blacks, non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele, higher dietary intake of vitamin D was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline. Compared to the 1st tertile of dietary intake of vitamin D and without APOE ε4 allele, the β (95%CI) for Blacks in 2nd and 3rd tertile were 0.014 (0.001, 0.027) and 0.017 (0.004, 0.03), respectively. For Whites, these estimates in 2nd and 3rd tertile were respectively, 0.023 (0.005, 0.041) and 0.007 (−0.011, 0.024). The presence of the APOE ε4 allele was associated with a faster rate of decline in cognitive function (Figure 2); however, Blacks with a higher intake of dietary vitamin D were not at increased risk of a faster cognitive decline compared to APOE ε4 non-carriers with lower dietary intake of vitamin D. The β (95%CI) of Blacks carriers of APOE ε4 and in 3rd tertile of dietary vitamin D intake was 0.001 (−0.014, 0.015) when we compared to the reference group, e.g., Blacks in the 1st tertile of dietary intake of vitamin D and without APOE ε4 allele.

Race modified the relationship between vitamin D and cognitive decline (P-value for interaction = 0.019), supporting the investigation separately in Blacks and Whites. There was no statistical evidence that the association of vitamin D diet with cognitive decline differed by age (P&gt;0.21), sex (P&gt;0.28), education (P&gt;0.25), body mass index (P&gt;0.38), or APOE ε4 (P&gt;0.07) in Blacks and Whites. Excluding the MMSE from the global cognition composite score did not change our main findings; that is, dietary intake of vitamin D is associated with a slower cognitive decline in Blacks (Supplementary Table 3). β (95%CI) for one-unit increase in log10-transformed dietary vitamin D was 0.028 (0.009, 0.046).

Discussion

In this prospective study of older adults with a suboptimal intake of vitamin D, a higher vitamin D intake was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in Blacks. Of the total vitamin D intake, dietary vitamin D was associated with a slower cognitive decline, and the association was independent of supplementation use. Higher intake of vitamin D, especially from the diet, may attenuate the risk of the APOE ε4 on cognition in Blacks since we found no additional risk among APOE ε4 carriers with higher dietary vitamin D intake when we compared to non-carriers but with lower vitamin D intake. In Whites, neither total vitamin D nor dietary vitamin D intake was associated with cognitive decline. These findings suggest that consuming foods rich in vitamin D may help slow the decline in cognitive abilities among Blacks as they age.

Epidemiological studies investigating the associations between vitamin D concentrations, cognitive function, and dementia have shown that individuals with lower vitamin D levels in serum (e.g., 25-hydroxy vitamin D) have a poorer cognitive function and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia [13,31–33]. The majority of circulating vitamin D is synthesized in human skin through sun exposure, but it is also available as a nutrient in fortified and unfortified foods (e.g., salmon, mushrooms, almonds, fortified milk). In the elderly, particularly minorities, the amount of vitamin D synthesized by the skin is inadequate due to limited sunlight exposure and less effective cutaneous production, making nutrition an essential source of vitamin D among older individuals [11,12]. Research focused on the relationship between dietary intake of vitamin D and cognition, although limited, has revealed that a higher intake of vitamin D is associated with better cognitive performance [34–36]. Specifically, a population-based study of 5,596 community-dwelling French women free of vitamin D supplements at baseline showed that women with an intake of vitamin D equal to or more than 35mg/wk had a better cognitive function than women with lower intake [34]. The authors further supported their findings by showing that higher vitamin D intake was also associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease in women free of vitamin D supplements [35]. Cognitive function in this study was assessed using the Pfeiffer Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire [34], and Alzheimer’s disease was diagnosed according to the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association working group [35]. Another recent investigation focused on a multiethnic cohort reported that higher vitamin D intake is associated with decreased risk of dementia during a mean follow-up of 5.8 years [36]. Our study reported similar associations that higher dietary intake was associated with slower cognitive decline among participants who did not use vitamin D supplements. However, we reported these significant associations among Blacks and not Whites. Compared to Whites, Blacks produce less vitamin D from the skin in response to usual levels of sun exposure [37,38], suggesting that dietary vitamin D becomes critical among them. Alternatively, Whites with a lower intake of vitamin D may have adequate serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D due to skin synthesis, and additional vitamin D from the diet or supplements may not add any additional benefit to their cognitive functioning.

While dietary vitamin D intake was associated with a slower cognitive decline in Blacks, no significant associations were found for vitamin D derived from supplements. The lack of association between vitamin D supplements and cognition has been reported in many clinical trials [39–41]. For example, a randomized clinical trial of 4,143 women aged 65 years and older and followed for 7.8 years showed no effect of vitamin D3/calcium treatment on incident cognitive impairment or dementia [40]. However, in a recent investigation, utilizing data from the VITAL randomized trial, authors reported modest cognitive benefits only in older Black adults over 2–3 years of follow-up [41]. In observation studies, investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cognitive functioning and dementia is challenging and could be prone to bias, such as treatment by indication (e.g., people with health concerns might be more predisposed to take supplements). However, another study among participants at risk of dementia showed that supplemental vitamin D intakes were associated with cortical thickness in regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s dementia [42]. Further research is required to understand the role of vitamin D supplementation in cognitive function and Alzheimer’s dementia.

APOE ε4 allele is an established genetic risk factor of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias [17], which also plays a crucial role in the metabolism of lipid-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D [43]. In fact, a recent experimental and epidemiological investigation demonstrated an association between the presence of APOE ε4 allele and higher concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, suggesting APOE ε4 as a potential modulator of vitamin D status that may protect against vitamin D deficiency [18]. Interestingly, the prevalence of APOE ε4 is differently distributed across the world with a higher frequency in individuals with melanin-rich (dark) skin or living in high latitudes [43,44]. High latitude and dark skin are also related to vitamin D deficiency, suggesting that the APOE ε4 - vitamin D relationship may have an evolutionary aspect [19]. Although in our study, we did not investigate the relationship between APOE ε4 and serum levels of vitamin D (e.g., 25-hydroxy vitamin D), we found that higher dietary intake of vitamin D may attenuate the genetic risk associated with APOE ε4 in Blacks, but not Whites. These findings align with our overall analysis that vitamin D intake is associated with cognition only in Blacks; however, further studies are required to investigate the impact of serum levels of vitamin D, APOE ε4, and cognition across race and ethnicity as well as to replicate our findings. Our results of dietary vitamin D intake and slower cognitive decline among APOE ε4 non-carriers align with a recent study that showed a lower risk of dementia [36].

The strength of our study includes a bi-racial study population with a prospective study design and 12 years of follow-up; the use of established and validated FFQ for older adults to determine the intake of vitamin D from foods and supplements [21]; and an in-person assessment of cognitive functions on a 3-year cycle, allowing us to determine the rate of cognitive decline. However, our study has several limitations. First, serum vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin D) are unknown, and we cannot determine vitamin D deficiency in our study population. However, studies indicate that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in older adults due to a number of different factors including inadequate sunlight exposure, adiposity, and poor nutrition. Although our study population likely had similar altitude effects of vitamin D, suggesting a similar sun exposure for Blacks and Whites many other factors (e.g., the use of sunscreens; time spent in the sun; skin pigmentation) may impact the relationship between sun exposure and vitamin D levels. Second, vitamin D intakes from self-reported FFQs are subject to measurement error, although the FFQ used in this study has been validated in this population-based cohort [21]. Third, our cognitive battery does not capture executive functioning. Fourth, findings were based on an observational study in which we cannot control for unmeasured confounders, and we shall not imply causal inferences. Fifth, the study results may not generalize to adults younger than 65 years old and other ethnic groups.

In conclusion, dietary vitamin D was associated with a slower cognitive decline, particularly in Blacks. The association was independent of supplementation use, suggesting that consuming foods rich in vitamin D may help slow the decline in cognitive abilities among Blacks as they age. Future studies shall identify other at-risk groups of vitamin D deficiency (e.g., Hispanic individuals) and evaluate the role of vitamin D from diet and supplements in cognitive decline and incident Alzheimer’s dementia.

Research in Context

Systematic review:

Vitamin D has received considerable interest in dementia research because the preva-lence of vitamin D deficiency is higher among older adults, particularly among older Blacks. The role of dietary vitamin D on cognition is not well-defined, especially in a cohort of racially diverse older adults.

Interpretation:

Dietary vitamin D intake was associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline in Blacks independently of supplementation use. Furthermore, dietary vitamin D may attenuate the risk of the APOE ε4 on cognition in Blacks since we found no additional risk among APOE ε4 carriers with higher dietary vitamin D intake compared to non-carriers but with lower vitamin D intake. In Whites, vitamin D intake was not associated with cognitive decline.

Future directions:

Future studies shall validate our findings and further investigate the role of diet and sup-plements on cognition on other at-risk groups of vitamin D deficiency (e.g., Hispanic individuals).
