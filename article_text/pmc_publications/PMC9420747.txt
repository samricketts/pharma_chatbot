OBJECTIVE:

To set syndrome stage-specific (e.g., cognitively unimpaired, severe dementia) metrics for functional change.

METHODS:

We selected 18,097 individuals who participated in two National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center visits between June 2005 and May 2020, with completed collateral rating of functioning on activities of daily living assessed by the Functional Activities Questionnaire.

Both distribution-based (i.e., regression-based reliable change indices) and anchor-based (i.e., typical change associated with advancing a syndromal stage for clinically meaningful difference) methods were applied for individuals classified as: unimpaired cognition, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, or severe dementia.

RESULTS:

There were marked differences in the distribution of functional ratings depending on their syndromal stage. There were also differences in the functional change associated with advancing across different syndromal stages. These informed stage-specific metrics for RCIs and clinically meaningful differences.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our indices provide a hitherto unavailable method that allows clinicians to determine whether observed functional change is reliable or meaningful based on syndromal stage.

Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)

pmcNeurodegenerative disease and cognitive impairment are, and will continue to be, topics of pressing concern for society and its individuals1. These conditions are increasingly prevalent with advancing age and can limit independence in functioning and activities of daily living (ADLs). Not only is accurate evaluation of ADLs—across basic, instrumental, and advanced domains—important for understanding the individual and shepherding appropriate care, but such assessment is critical for accurate diagnosis and syndromal staging across impairment/dementia frameworks2. One commonly used functional measure, the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)3, was recently established to have robust clinimetric properties across types of reliability, validity, and classification accuracy, with equivalent performance across demographic and health disparity groups4. Surprisingly, despite the progressive nature of neurodegenerative illness and wide use of this measure, there are no published indices or guidelines for interpreting change on the FAQ.

Several methods exist for determining whether change on a measure is reliable and meaningful, including distribution-based and anchor-based approaches5. Distribution-based approaches typically take information about the measure gleaned from an appropriate reference group (e.g., cognitively unimpaired individuals) and set a criterion for change, such as half a standard deviation. More advanced methods include reliable change indices (RCIs) and standardized regression-based (SRB) formulae, which incorporate typical scores at different times, variability (both within and across time points), and error/reliability estimates to more accurately assess change6. Anchor-based approaches typically take an external criterion and quantify the amount of measure change associated with that criterion. When the criterion is one with established currency in clinical practice, these thresholds are typically referred to as clinically meaningful differences (CMDs). One characteristic that both methods share is that, once derived, the RCI or CMD is then uniformly applied across different levels of impairment or syndromal stage.

However, recent research suggests that the utility of clinical metrics changes across the dementia syndrome spectrum7,8, with some metrics being more appropriate for asymptomatic individuals whereas others better capture late stages of illness. This is partly related to how the distributions of measures change over the disease spectrum4,7,9 (e.g., amyloid deposition plateaus after a certain stage and no longer offers predictive value), suggesting that the information obtained from a control reference group may not be appropriate across clinical populations. This understanding is leading to calls for stage-specific metrics, particularly when assessing progression and change over time4,7 although, to the best of our knowledge, multiple stage-specific statistics and indices have yet to be tangibly and usefully applied to common clinical measures, such as the FAQ.

As such, the aim of this paper is to: 1) establish multi-stage distributional and reliability statistics for a functional measure (i.e., FAQ) and 2) use these to create useful RCIs and CMDs, stratified across syndromal stages.

Method

Setting and participants

The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) is funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and comprises several U.S.-based Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs). The current sample includes data from 38 ADRCs, with data collected between June 2005-May 2020. This yielded a sample of 18,097 unique individuals who completed the FAQ at two consecutive ADRC Uniform Data Set visits, selected from the NACC June 2020 data freeze. Once these selection criteria were applied, per NACC uploading prerequisites, no other data was missing. Each ADRC uses different recruitment methods, which may include convenience sampling. Each ADRC is required to undergo its own IRB review and obtain informed consent from participants before submitting to NACC.

Measures

The FAQ is a collateral rating scale of an individual’s functional status and ability to complete instrumental and advanced ADLs3. The FAQ contains 10 items that are rated on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (normal/independent) to 3 (dependent). FAQ total scores can range from 0–30 with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment. Prior research has shown that the FAQ has strong reliability and validity coefficients and is able to accurately detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia4.

The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument10,11) is a well-validated and reliable semi-structured interview which assesses an individual’s neurocognitive and functional status across six domains: memory, orientation, judgement &amp; problem solving, community affairs, home &amp; hobbies, and personal care. Individuals’ level of impairment is then staged into one of five diagnostic categories: (1) cognitively unimpaired (CU), (2) questionable/MCI, (3) mild dementia, (4) moderate dementia, or (5) severe dementia.

Data analysis

After selecting individuals with two visits, stable and progressive subsamples were created for each CDR stage. To evaluate differences across time 1 (T1) and time 2 (T2), the nonparametric dependent samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used, with Cohen’s d to quantify effect size. For Cohen’s d, we interpreted it with these guidelines: 0 – .20 (negligible), .20 – .50 (small), .50 – .80 (medium), &gt;.80 (large)12. To evaluate relationships across time, the nonparametric Spearman’s rho was used. To evaluate consistency across time, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. We interpreted test-retest reliability coefficients as follows: ≤ .50 (unacceptable), .51–.59 (poor), .60–.69 (questionable), .70–.79 (acceptable), .80–.89 (good), ≥.90 (excellent)13. We interpreted ICC coefficients as follows: &lt;.50 (poor), .50–.75 (moderate), .76–.90 (good), &gt;.90 (excellent)14.

CMDs were derived by taking the average FAQ difference observed among individuals who advanced a CDR stage. RCIs were estimated two ways. First, we applied the Jacobson and Truax’s formula (RCIJT)15 to the current sample, with values that corresponded to 80%, 90%, and 95% limits, such that RCIJT = (T2 - T1) / SEDIFF, where SEDIFF = √2SD12 (1 – r12). Reliability was extracted from the overall stable subsample, and SEDIFF was derived from each stable syndromal stage, which resulted in different RCIJT values depending on T1 syndromal stage. A benefit of the Jacobson and Truax formula is that it allows for creation of reliable change cutoffs for observed T2 and T1 scores, which can be quickly implemented as a rule of thumb by clinicians. Critical values for 80%- (1.282), 90%- (1.645), and 95%- (1.960) confidence intervals were applied to algebraically transformed formulas to derive T2 - T1 cutoffs. Furthermore, as the FAQ is a rating form (as opposed to a performance-based measure), it is not necessary to correct for practice effects. However, the RCIJT does not allow for correcting for elapsed time nor demographic characteristics. Complex-RCISRB equations can incorporate multiple variables that bear on change (e.g., syndromal stage, elapsed time, education) and produce RCIs by comparing the observed T2 score to the predicted T2 score (T2’).

As such, our second RCI approach created a complex-RCISRB from the stable subsample, and demographic variables (baseline age and education), retest interval, baseline syndromal stage, and the T1 FAQ score were regressed on the T2 FAQ score, with the predictors regressed in separate blocks rather than with a stepwise approach. Planned variable selection consisting of the following predictors entered in each respective block: T1 FAQ score (Block 1), baseline syndromal stage via CDR rating (Block 2), restest interval (Block 3), age at baseline (Block 4), and education at baseline (Block 5). Then the regression software’s derivation of the model standard error of estimate (SEEST) was included to determine RCISRB = (T2 – T2’) / SEEST.

Although different standard error terms have been suggested, a recent study indicated that SEEST and the standard error for the prediction of regression (SEPRED) function similarly, particularly in larger samples16. We then validated the RCIJT and RCISRB, both derived from the subsample of stable individuals, in the subsample of progressing individuals and report the percentage of individuals who were labeled as progressed, stable, or improved. We also calculated area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC-ROC) to quantify how well both RCI approaches classified those who progressed from those who were stable. Given distributional differences among syndromal stages, we created three criterion comparisons: 1) CU stable vs. CU converting to MCI; 2) MCI stable vs. MCI converted to dementia; and 3) Mild dementia stable vs. mild dementia converting to advanced dementia. Analyses were run using SPSS (27.0)17, JASP (0.16.1)18, and R (4.0.4)19 with psych package20.

Results

Participant characteristics

The sample was 37% male (n=6754) and 63% female (n=11,343), with mean educational attainment of 15.47 years (SD=3.14; range=0–30 years), mean T1 age of 71.24 (SD=10.17; range=19–109), and mean T2 age of 72.50 (SD=10.12; range=20–110). Primary ethnoracial composition was 75% White (n=13,507), 13% Black (n=2264), 6% Hispanic (n=1115), 3% multiracial (n=517), and 2% Asian/Pacific Islander (n=426). As noted in Table 1, the average time between T1 and T2 visits across the whole sample was 4.52 years. Mean times that elapsed between T1 and T2 generally were comparable between subsamples, ranging from 2.5–5.4 years.

RCI &amp; CMD statistics

As noted in Table 1, the FAQ demonstrated good-to-excellent reliability in both rho and ICC in the overall sample, and stable and progression subsamples. When measure variance was further restricted by selecting stable individuals within a CDR category, the reliability estimates were all attenuated. When selecting individuals who progressed a CDR stage, the reliability coefficients were further attenuated. Despite selecting individuals with stable CDR stages, some change was observed on the FAQ, with negligible effects in CU individuals, small effects for those with MCI and severe dementia, and moderate differences for those with mild and moderate dementia. Among individuals who progressed a CDR stage, exceptionally large effects were observed for those with MCI or mild dementia initially, with a medium-to-large effect for those with moderate dementia initially, and a small effect for CU individuals. Accordingly, estimates of SEDIFF varied across syndromal stages (CU = 0.505, MCI = 2.356, Mild dementia = 3.131, Moderate dementia = 1.968, Severe dementia = 0.989).

These differences in distributional properties at each stage and differing response to stage change led to differences in RCIJT and CMD values at each stage (Table 2). Those who were CU at first evaluation only needed small changes in FAQ in order to demonstrate statistically significant change. However, those who with MCI or a mild dementia stage initially needed the most change in FAQ scores for meaningful or statistically significant change.

In evaluation of candidate predictors for the RCISRB model, all five models were statistically significant, but the models only resulted in a significant change in F through the fourth model containing baseline FAQ total score, baseline syndromal stage, elapsed time, and age at baseline as significant predictors. The addition of education in the fifth model did not contribute to R2-change, nor a meaningful reduction in SEEST. As such, the final model utilized T1 FAQ score, baseline syndromal stage, time interval, and age at baseline, with the following unstandardized regression equation: T2’ = −0.175 + (0.828 × T1 FAQ score) + (1.963 × baseline syndromal stage [coded 0–4]) + (−0.000123 × time interval [days]) + (.008 × baseline age). SEEST = 2.673 and adjusted-R2 = .91.

Cross-validated model performance

Stage-specific RCIJT and RCISRB were calculated for each individual in the progressive subsample for the 80%, 90%, 95% reliable change score thresholds (see Table 3). Among those who progressed a CDR level, 43–49% were also labeled as having progressed on the FAQ based on the RCIJT model compared to 31–42% based on the RCISRB model. By contrast, among those who progressed a CDR level, 47–53% were labeled as remaining stable on the FAQ via the RCIJT model and 56–68% via the RCISRB model. Finally, among those who progressed a CDR level, 4% were labeled as having improved on the FAQ via the RCIJT model versus only 1–2% via the RCISRB model.

Models were most helpful for those who had MCI at baseline evaluation in distinguishing those who progressed from those who were stable (RCIJT AUC = .82, 95% CI [.80, .84]; RCISRB AUC = .87, 95% CI [.86, .89]). They were next helpful for those who had mild dementia at initial evaluation (RCIJT AUC = .64, 95% CI [.61, .66]; RCISRB AUC = .69, 95% CI [.67, .72]). Although statistically significant, they were least helpful for those who were CU at first visit (RCIJT AUC = .61, 95% CI [.59, .64]; RCISRB AUC = .57, 95% CI [.54, .59]).

Posthoc analyses

The wide retest interval range does not conform with typical proscriptions for 1- or 2-year follow-ups. Although the interval is accounted for in the RCISRB, it cannot be accounted for in the RCIJT and, as such, supplementary analyses were run on subsamples whose T2 fell around median timeframes of 1 year (181–540 days) or 2 years (541–900 days). Relevant descriptive, distributional, and reliability statistics for the two samples are listed in Supplementary Table 1. RCI cutoffs for 1- and 2-year follow-up samples did not deviate strongly from those derived from the total sample and are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

Discussion

The current study aimed to devise multi-stage distributional and reliability statistics for the FAQ as well as to produce useful RCIs and CMDs, stratified across syndromal stages. We found excellent reliability in both rho and ICC across FAQ scores in the overall sample. However, reliability estimates were generally attenuated when examining individuals within specific CDR categories, and even more so for those progressed CDR stages between timepoints. The latter is not surprising given that this subsample was selected due to its inconsistency over time. As mentioned above, the differences in distributional properties across stages influenced the level of change in FAQ scores necessary to reach the threshold of statistical significance. When individuals were CU at first evaluation, only small changes were required to attain this threshold, whereas meaningful or statistically significant change was indicated by greater changes in FAQ scores for those who with MCI in or in a mild dementia stage initially. The differences in sensitivity to change at stages are consistent with prior research by González and colleagues wherein IRT analyses determined that the FAQ provided the most information about mild instrumental ADL (IADL) difficulties, which would correspond with those in, or transitioning to, mild dementia4. This study further confirms that the FAQ, will demonstrate more utility in tracking change for those who already have some IADL difficulties (e.g., MCI, mild dementia), and should be supplemented for those who are CU (where cognitive testing and biomarkers would be preferential) or in moderate-to-severe syndromal stages (where measures of basic ADLs are more appropriate for tracking). These findings are not surprising in considering floor effects, in which most individuals who are CU are likely to have no to minimal functional changes; therefore, the item content of the FAQ is less likely to capture the changes that can occur in those who start as CU.

The generally low sensitivity observed in Table 3 may be partially explained by the fact that CUs are the largest proportion of individuals in the sample. Another explanation is that the CDR—while pertinent and reasonable—is an imperfect criterion for “pure” IADL ability, as it also captures cognition and basic ADLs, such that change on the CDR may not necessarily be accompanied by change on the FAQ, particularly in those transitioning from CU to MCI, which is characterized by increasing cognitive difficulty with maintenance of functional independence (although they may have increasing difficulty in doing so compared to CUs). This hypothesis is supported by the AUCs, which meaningfully increase when discriminating those transitioning to, or from, mild dementia. This may be of utility to clinicians working with advanced dementia, as current cognitive measures for tracking change become increasingly futile as individuals progress from mild dementia21.

Unlike traditional neuropsychological tests in which an examinee can exhibit clinically significant score declines and/or improvements, there would be few scenarios in which functional improvement would be expected across evaluations unless an examinee was recovering from an acute event (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, altered mental status) at the time of initial evaluation. As such, the majority of examinees would be expected to have stable or declining FAQ scores between evaluations. Conversely, a ceiling effect likely is present among individuals at the opposite end of the spectrum with moderate to severe dementia at baseline, given this measure does not have coverage of basic functional activities (e.g., eating, toileting) that begin to deteriorate as dementia progresses to the more advanced stages. Accordingly, in its current iteration, the FAQ appears to be most useful at detecting functional changes as individuals transition from MCI to mild dementia and mild dementia to moderate dementia. Clinicians and researchers should consider this when considering complementary measures to address the spectrum of change they work with. In addition to the longitudinal properties elaborated here, the FAQ appears to have strong cross-sectional diagnostic utility at baseline to distinguish CU-MCI-dementia4.

Considering the above information, RCIs and CMDs should not be uncritically or uniformly applied regardless of context. For this study, we decided to use the Jacobson and Truax RCI15 and developed a complex-RCISRB, although others have been proposed for neuropsychological research and clinical application (e.g., Chelune et al. RCI; Iverson RCI; Maasen et al. SRB)22–24. A relative advantage of the RCIJT is that can yield a rule-of-thumb cut score from observed T2 and T1 values. An advantage of SRB equations, like the one applied here, rather than traditional RCI models is that they account for reliability, practice effects, regression to the mean, measurement error, time interval, and demographic (e.g., age, education) data to predict retest scores. It is likely for this reason that our complex RCISRB model had smaller percentages of individuals who progressed on the FAQ despite advancing a CDR stage compared to the RCIJT model (Table 3), as our model included numerous demographic and clinical variables to optimize accurate prediction of retest scores.

Aside from the availability of various models for predicting change, different CMD metrics can be proposed depending on the purpose. We used the referent of advancing a level in syndromal stage; however, as we established, there is variability in functioning within syndromal stages, and we can envision a situation wherein functional change would be meaningful despite being beneath CMD thresholds. For example, as clinicians we have been presented with cases wherein family had increasing functional concerns due to a change in a particular cognitive domain or problematic behavior (e.g., forgetting to lock doors), although the patient was determined to still be within the same overall syndromal stage. In the present case, using an alternative method such as clinician-determined diagnoses may have been problematic due to variability in how such diagnoses are established across ADRCs and the fact that clinician-determined diagnoses likely include consideration of all data, including FAQ scores, which could be a source of criterion contamination. Moreover, clinician diagnoses in the NACC Uniform Data Set are clustered into a 3-stage metric (i.e., CU, MCI, dementia), which would have limited our ability to evaluate the FAQ’s reliability for assessing progression across dementia stages. Future research may establish CMDs with different referents to better match the range of settings and projects.

This study had several strengths. Specifically, we purposefully sought to establish RCIs and CMDs stratified across syndromal stages in order to increase clinical applicability. Functioning is often utilized as a treatment end point for many interventions but, until now, clinicians did not have a metric for determining whether any observed change was meaningful. Secondly, we did not limit the retest sample to those who complete the FAQ within a certain time range since in clinical practice, individuals do not tend to return at prescribed times. This also allowed for a greater sample size within each subgroup. We also cross-validated our predictions derived from a stable sample, to evaluate their performance in a progressing sample, which provides more reproducible evidence regarding model performance. Despite these strengths, our study has some limitations. Foremost, the NACC Uniform Data Set is not from an epidemiological study and does not represent the United States population at large. As such, the sample was predominantly an older, White, highly educated, and English-speaking sample, limiting generalizability to historically underserved populations. Additionally, recent research using NACC data has suggested that collateral sources that cohabitate with the individual, have more proximal relationships (i.e., paid caregiver, spouse, adult child), or have higher educational attainment are more likely to provide higher FAQ ratings, albeit with negligible-to-small effects25. This potential confound may be further exacerbated if different collateral sources provided ratings at each timepoint, although the overall reliability of FAQ estimates may minimize this concern. Moreover, the time elapsed between T1 and T2 assessment timepoints was not even and varied widely for some individuals. Unfortunately, the NACC does not include more detailed information to explain this variability such that this potentially more nuanced characteristic of the sample remains unknown. Finally, our study did not examine differences in RCIs and CMDs based on suspected etiological causes of neurodegenerative disease. It is possible that different subtypes of dementia may vary with regard to their trajectories of functional decline across syndromal stages. That said, the majority of individuals with dementia present with mixed etiologies and accurate dementia subtyping is often unavailable in the primary care setting26. Thus, our study aimed to provide an easy-to-use metric of clinically meaningful decline that can be used to inform disease monitoring and treatment planning. Future work in the area may consider using a performance-based criterion of IADLs, such as the revised Direct Assessment of Functional Status or the Texas Functional Living Scale. While future work in this area is necessary, our study provides sensitive and specific indices of reliable and meaningful change on functional outcome measures may improve longitudinal clinical staging and enhance clinical-trial endpoints.

Values reflect the minimum increase in FAQ score (i.e., functional decline) needed for a reliable change at different confidence intervals as well as clinically meaningful difference based on baseline syndromal stage via Clinical Dementia Rating Scale. For example, an individual with mild cognitive impairment at baseline whose FAQ score increased by 4 points across the retest interval would be considered a significant change by the 80% and 90% RCI criterion, but not 95% RCI or CMD criterion.

Table 3. Percentage of Individuals Labeled as Reliably Changed on FAQ who Progressed on CDR.

	RCIJT	RCISRB	
	80%	90%	95%	80%	90%	95%	
Progressed	1295 (49%)	1229 (47%)	1135 (43%)	1109 (42%)	951 (36%)	834 (31%)	
Stable	1235 (47%)	1304 (49%)	1411 (53%)	1493 (56%)	1666 (63%)	1790 (68%)	
Improved	115 (4%)	112 (4%)	99 (4%)	43 (2%)	28 (1%)	21 (1%)	
Note. N=2,645. Progressed refers to those with worsening (i.e., increasing) FAQ scores from time 1 to time 2; Stable refers to those with stable FAQ scores from time 1 to time 2; Improved refers to those with improving (i.e., decreasing) FAQ scores from time 1 to time 2. Critical RCI values for each confidence interval are: 80% = +/−1.282; 90% = +/−1.645; 95% = +/− 1.960
