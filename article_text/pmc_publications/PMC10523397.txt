The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first regions of the brain affected by pathology in both Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the reasons for this selective vulnerability are not completely understood. Several features of LC neurons have been proposed as contributing factors to this dysfunction and degeneration, and this review will focus on the presence of neuromelanin (NM). NM is a dark pigment unique to catecholaminergic cells that is formed of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) metabolites, heavy metals, protein aggregates, and oxidated lipids. We cover what is currently known about NM and the limitations of historical approaches, then discuss the new human tyrosinase (hTyr) model of NM production in rodent catecholamine cells in vivo that offers unique opportunities for studying its neurobiology, neurotoxicity, and potential of NM-based therapeutics for treating neurodegenerative disease.

pmc1.1 The locus coeruleus

The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small brainstem nucleus, comprised of less than 50,000 neurons in the human brain (Mouton et al., 1994) and just 3,000 neurons in the rodent brain (Sara, 2009). Despite its stature, the LC is critically important in much of our daily cognitive functioning as it modulates networks involved in a variety of behaviors, from sleep and arousal to the stress response system (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005; Poe et al., 2020). The LC contains catecholaminergic neurons which rely on the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) for neural communication. The LC is the primary source of central NE and sends unmyelinated axonal projections to virtually every other region of the brain (Foote et al., 1983; Poe et al., 2020).

1.2 The locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system in neurodegenerative disease

Unlike degeneration of DA neurons, which is causal for Parkinson’s disease (PD), the contribution of LC-NE system dysfunction/degeneration to PD and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is more subtle and has been underappreciated until recently. LC degeneration in PD and AD was noted decades ago, but was thought to be non-specific and only occur in later stages of disease (Tomlinson et al., 1981; Mann et al., 1983). In fact, the LC is one of the first nuclei affected in both disorders, being the first brain region to accumulate hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in AD and among the earliest brain regions with detectable α-synuclein aggregates in PD, displaying pathology even before notoriously affected DA neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) (Zarow et al., 2003; Braak et al., 2011; Del Tredici and Braak, 2013). It is now thought that this early pathology initiates dysfunction of LC-NE transmission and degeneration of axons/terminals, which triggers prodromal symptoms of AD and PD including sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, apathy, and agitation, and eventually kills the cells, which accelerates cognitive impairment (Halliday et al., 1990; Chan-Palay, 1991; Busch et al., 1997; Peskind et al., 2005; Vazey and Aston-Jones, 2012; Wilson et al., 2013; Mather and Harley, 2016; Hinson et al., 2017; Kelly et al., 2017; Theofilas et al., 2017; Weinshenker, 2018; Li et al., 2019; Doppler et al., 2021; Jacobs et al., 2021; Cassidy et al., 2022; Gilvesy et al., 2022; Van Egroo et al., 2022).

1.3 Mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability of LC neurons

Several factors may contribute to the selective vulnerability of noradrenergic neurons in neurodegenerative disease. Characteristics of LC neurons, such as their long and diffuse axonal projections, intrinsic pacemaker activity and high metabolic demand, a unique neuroimmune profile, and the presence of intracellular pigment deposits, might contribute to their early and severe degeneration (Weinshenker, 2018; Oertel et al., 2019; Matchett et al., 2021).

1.3.1 Axonal Projections

The LC possesses long and highly branched axonal projections distributed widely throughout the brain (Foote et al., 1983). These axons are unmyelinated, and thus more vulnerable to damage. Axon terminals are lost first when neurons degenerate (Doppler et al., 2021), making this feature an appealing candidate for LC vulnerability. However, the cell bodies of these neurons are remarkably resilient, even after fiber loss (Weinshenker, 2018). This suggests that axonal damage is just one component of LC dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease.

1.3.2 Metabolic Demand

Noradrenergic neurons also display intrinsic pacemaker activity, firing regularly under basal conditions. This tonic pattern of activation is critical for LC functioning but is metabolically demanding. This can compound cellular strain, leading to high levels of oxidant stress (Wang and Michaelis, 2010) and mitochondrial dysfunction (Sanchez-Padilla et al., 2014). Importantly, these factors are well-appreciated for the harmful role they play in neurodegeneration (Nicholls, 2008; Surmeier et al., 2010). High activity levels also lead to increased production of catecholamine metabolites, some of which can be toxic to neurons. For example, elevated production of the MAO-A NE metabolite 3,4- dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL) can covalently modify tau has been linked to increased levels of asparagine endopeptidase and subsequent tau aggregation in LC neurons in vitro and in vivo (Kang et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2022).

1.3.3 Neuroimmune Contributions

An additional factor contributing to the selective vulnerability of LC neurons is their unique neuroimmune profile. Catecholamine neurons of the SN and LC express high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (Cebrian et al., 2014). MHCs are found on the surface of all nucleated cells and aid in antigen presentation. While MHC-II proteins display exogenous antigens, MCH-I aids in the expression of peptide fragments from within the cell. Importantly, MHC-I presents antigens to cytotoxic T cells, triggering cell death. Indeed, cytotoxic CD8+ cells have been observed near catecholamine neurons in the SN and LC expressing MHC-1, suggesting the expression of MHC-I may render these neurons vulnerable to T-cell-mediated degeneration (Cebrian et al., 2014).

It may seem maladaptive for LC neurons to trigger their death, especially by presenting antigens from within the cell. However, the last unique feature of catecholamine neurons may account for this behavior: the presence of intracellular organelles containing neuromelanin (NM) pigment.

1.4 Characteristics of neuromelanin

Perhaps one of the most defining features of the LC is the presence of NM. NM granules are comprised of pheomelanin and eumelanin pigments which reside in the cytoplasm of SN-DA and LC-NE neurons. The pigmentation of catecholamine neurons in the SN and the LC is so robust that it can be appreciated by gross anatomical inspection, a finding first described centuries ago which led to the unique nomenclature of these regions, translating from Latin to “black substance” and “blue spot”, respectively. While trace amounts of NM have also been found in non-catecholaminergic brain regions, including the cerebellum and cortex, its presence is structurally and chemically different from SN-NM and LC-NM (Zecca et al., 2008b; Engelen et al., 2012). Interestingly, this neuronal pigmentation is found only in the brains of humans and non-human primates, and to a lesser extent in a few other long-living animals, such as horses. Rodent SN and LC neurons contain very little, if any, pigmentation (Marsden, 1961; DeMattei et al., 1986). Thus, although NM is a defining characteristic of SN and LC catecholamine neurons, most of what is known about the formation and function of these granules in vivo has been limited to post-mortem analysis and not subjected to experimental manipulations easily accomplished in model systems such as rodents that can establish causal relationships.

1.5 Neuromelanin formation

NM is a byproduct of the catecholamine synthesis and metabolism pathway (Fig. 1). NE is produced in vesicles at the axon terminal via the catecholamine synthesis pathway. This pathway begins when the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) converts tyrosine, either present in interstitial fluids taken up by neurons or produced by enzymatic reaction from the essential amino acid phenylalanine, to form L-DOPA. This dopamine (DA) precursor is synthesized into the neurotransmitter by DOPA decarboxylase. Once DA is formed in the cytoplasm, it is quickly packaged into vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Inside the vesicle, the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) converts DA into NE. Upon neuronal activation and calcium entry into the terminal, the vesicles then fuse with the plasma membrane and neurotransmission ensues. Following release, LC neurons can also clear excess extracellular catecholamines. LC dendrites and axon terminals express the norepinephrine transporter (NET), the monoamine transporter that is responsible for returning excess NE into the presynaptic neuron. The NET is also capable of DA uptake. In the cytoplasm, NE is either repackaged into synaptic vesicles by VMAT2 or decomposed by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), eventually forming its main metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG). This process is critically important to the health of the neuron, as free catecholamine metabolites are highly reactive and can cause oxidative stress and toxicity (Kang et al., 2020; Goldstein, 2021).

Current convention suggests that the process of NM formation is initiated when DA or NE are oxidized by iron and/or copper, which are found in high concentrations in SN and LC neurons, respectively (Zecca et al., 2004b; Monzani et al., 2019). This reaction forms DA- and NE-quinones, which are subsequently converted into pheomelanin and eumelanin through similar but distinct pathways (Bush et al., 2006; Krainc et al., 2022; Nagatsu et al., 2023). Thus, neuronal pigmentation is believed to be auto-oxidative (Sulzer et al., 2000), as opposed to melanin pigmentation of the skin and hair, which is enzymatically driven (Sanchez-Ferrer et al., 1995). Once synthesized, pheomelanin makes up the core component of NM, while eumelanin comprises the surrounding “shell” (Bush et al., 2006) (although this structure has been debated; see: (Zucca et al., 2023)). These pigments bind additional compounds in the cell to form NM granules that can measure up to 30 nm in size (Bush et al., 2006).

In addition to the primary pigment components, NM granules also contain a variety of other compounds (Capucciati et al., 2021). Most notably, NM chelates metal cations including iron, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, cobalt, mercury, lead, and cadmium (Zecca and Swartz, 1993; Liu et al., 2004; Zecca et al., 2008b). Additionally, catecholamine metabolites such as DOPAC and DOPEG have been identified as elements of SN-NM and LC-NM, respectively (Wakamatsu et al., 2015). These pigmented granules can also bind various psychotropic drugs such as chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and imipramine (Salazar et al., 1978), pesticides, and other toxic compounds (D’Amato et al., 1986). Large lipid droplets are another substantial element of NM-containing organelles. Dolichols are the major lipid component of NM, accounting for 14% of the mass of the isolated pigment (Zecca et al., 2000; Zucca et al., 2018).

Following the formation of these granular masses, a proposed fusion with autophagosomes encloses all of the components with a double-layered membrane (Zucca et al., 2018). While this barrier successfully separates toxic NM compounds from the intracellular space, it also makes the breakdown of these pigment granules all but impossible once they are formed. Thus, the concentration of pigmentation in the LC increases over time, beginning at around 3 years of age (Cowen, 1986; Zecca et al., 2004a), potentially conferring a lifetime of protection from harmful compounds. This timeline of accumulation may also explain why NM is not evident in rodent neurons, as rats and mice only live ~2 years.

1.6 Neuromelanin function

Leading thought in the field suggests that NM formation evolved from a necessity to sequester intracellular catecholamines and prevent accumulation of catecholamine-derived toxic products in highly active neurons (Sulzer et al., 2000). Due to the intrinsic pacemaker activity of the LC, noradrenergic neurons are prone to sustained periods of activation, leading to rapid DA and NE production and turnover. When these neurotransmitters cannot be packaged into synaptic vesicles by VMAT2 as quickly as they are formed, increased cytosolic catecholamine levels become available for metabolism by MAO-A and COMT. Importantly, metabolites of DA (e.g. DOPAL) and NE (e.g. DOPEGAL) are highly reactive and toxic to neurons (Kang et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2020). Taken together, the characteristic persistent firing rate and subsequent catecholamine load of LC neurons support the hypothesis of NM production as a mechanism of sequestering these compounds to protect the neurons from damage. Additionally, this theory also provides a compelling rationale for the specificity of this pigmentation for catecholamine neurons.

1.7 Neuromelanin neurotoxicity

Despite the compelling case for NM as an adaptive mechanism protecting neurons from the necessity of producing catecholamines for neuromodulation, certain conditions may lead to an inadvertent toxic role of these granules. While NM is largely protective across the lifetime, its presence may become detrimental when cells die prematurely in neurodegenerative disease (Fig. 2). This issue is two-fold, as LC cells are not only losing a vital neuroprotective mechanism, but as NM accumulates and is released from organelles, it may have detrimental effects on intracellular functioning and affect surrounding neurons once they reach the extracellular space. It is not entirely clear what mediates the conversion of NM from a neuroprotective to a toxic role, but interactions between NM accumulation with age and pathology (e.g. alpha-synuclein, tau, neuroinflammation, heavy metals, etc) and other cellular dysfunctions may be at play.

1.7.1 Intracellular Toxicity

Because there is no way to safely dispose of NM once the granules are formed, LC neurons eventually become full of pigmentation, which could interfere with other cellular machinery and function. For example, NM eventually occupies most of the neuronal cytoplasm, and both autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome systems are defective specifically within NM-containing regions from post-mortem PD brains (Fedorow et al., 2006; Cook and Petrucelli, 2009; Dehay et al., 2010; Vila, 2019; Vila et al., 2019). This issue may be exacerbated when the neurons are under stress. Dysregulation of calcium, which can result from excitotoxicity, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These harmful free radicals can degrade NM in the cytosol, leading to the release the iron and other toxic metals that were previously bound (Zecca et al., 2004a; Zecca et al., 2008b). NM has also been reported to inhibit the 26S proteasome, which could disrupt normal protein degradation, leading to an accumulation of abnormal proteins such as a-syn (Shamoto-Nagai et al., 2004).

1.7.2 Extracellular Toxicity

It has been proposed that as LC neurons die, the NM granules and their previously-bound toxins are released and have the potential to damage neighboring cells (Zecca et al., 2003; Zecca et al., 2006). NM released from the neurons is subsequently phagocytosed by microglia, leading to microglia activation and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS), in addition to other proinflammatory factors (Zhang et al., 2011). Application of purified NM from the human brain promotes dopaminergic cell death in microglia-DA neuron cell cultures and the rat SN (Zhang et al., 2011).

Taken together, these features suggest that although NM may have developed as an intracellular protective mechanism for catecholamine neurons, sustained pigmentation over a lifetime may ultimately contribute to vulnerability to neurodegeneration.

1.8 Previous work on neuromelanin

1.8.1 Postmortem Human Tissue

Postmortem human samples have provided insight into the link between NM-expressing neuronal populations and PD. We now know that total NM concentration decreases as SN and LC neurons degenerate in PD (Zecca et al., 2002), and that heavily-pigmented SN neurons show far greater degeneration than other nearby dopaminergic regions, such as nuclei A8 and A10 (Hirsch et al., 1988), and nearly all PD patients exhibit substantial loss of NM-containing neurons in the LC (Zarow et al., 2003; Sulzer and Surmeier, 2013). Furthermore, it has been reported that the most heavily pigmented neurons are lost first in neurodegeneration (Mann and Yates, 1983). The deterioration of pigmented neurons and subsequent decrease in NM abundance within these brain structures has provided an interesting target for clinical diagnosis through NM-MRI (Cassidy et al., 2019; Kelberman et al., 2020). However, to ensure that NM-MRI is an appropriate readout of neuronal integrity, the presence of NM must be definitively linked to living neurons. As a majority of prior research in the field has been limited to postmortem samples and imaging, we do not know definitely whether or for how long NM can persist in the extracellular space after its host cells are gone. If true, using NM-MRI as a proxy for SN and LC neurons might be misleading, as it would not be a direct readout of neuronal integrity and thus a more complex clinical measurement of disease progression.

1.8.2 In vitro and in vivo Studies

The absence of NM from the brains of typical model organisms, such as mice and rats, has limited research regarding the role that NM plays in PD onset and progression, but some prior work has studied NM in cultured catecholaminergic cells. For example, NM has been induced in rat SN and PC12 cell cultures through the administration of L-DOPA, which is converted to DA by aromatic acid decarboxylase in the cytosol (Sulzer et al., 2000). Other studies have introduced synthetic NM to these cells to investigate the extracellular impact and uptake of this pigment by dopaminergic neurons (Ostergren et al., 2005). These in vitro studies are complimented by work demonstrating that NM pigment isolated from human brain can be injected into the rat SN, leading to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Zecca et al., 2008a). While cell culture does allow for experimental manipulation, this technique is not wellsuited for answering systematic questions regarding the protective vs the toxic role of NM over time in vivo.

1.8.3 Enzymatically-driven neuromelanin accumulation in rodents

Recently, a viral vector-mediated approach for expressing pigmentation in the SN of rodents was developed through the introduction of human tyrosinase (hTyr), the enzyme responsible for peripheral melanin production (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019). Although endogenous NM production is thought to be an auto-oxidative process, the introduction of hTyr effectively drives pigmentation in catecholamine neurons of both rats and mice. Importantly, this pigmentation shares several structural aspects with endogenous NM from humans, as it contains NM-like pigment, lipid droplets, and a membrane encasement visible by electron microscopy (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019), although a rigorous chemical and physical characterization of this pigment is still needed. Perhaps the most striking finding of this study is that prolonged pigment expression in rodent SN neurons eventually leads to neuron degeneration and subsequent motor impairments (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019). Furthermore, this work found that enhancing lysosomal proteostasis was sufficient to reduce intracellular NM levels, mitigating neurodegeneration in hTyr-expressing mice (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019).

Adapting this approach, our group has recently demonstrated a similar hTyr-induced pigmentation in the LC of mice (Iannitelli et al., 2023). Cre-dependent AAV-hTyr virus was infused bilaterally into the LC of 2-month old TH-Cre mice, and LC integrity and NE-sensitive behaviors were examined 1–10 weeks later. We found that viral vector-mediated hTyr expression drove pigment expression in the LC that recapitulated key features of endogenous NM found in primates, including melanins, lipid droplets, and a double-membrane encasement. Pigment accumulation resulted in mild neurodegeneration, altered catecholamine levels, and transcriptional changes as early as 1 week post-injection. By 6–10 weeks, severe LC neurodegeneration was observed. Additionally, we found that pigmentation persisted in the region for some time after cell loss had occurred, and the space vacated by dying noradrenergic LC neurons was infiltrated with reactive astrocytes. Just as pigmentation-induced neurodegeneration of the SN led to impairments indicative of motor symptoms of PD (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019), we found that NM accumulation led to time-dependent behavioral abnormalities in hTyr-expressing mice which closely mimic some early prodromal symptoms of PD and AD including sleep disturbances and anxiety (Iannitelli et al., 2023).

1.9. Remaining questions and future directions

The phenotypes of NM-expressing mice were reminiscent of LC dysfunction and degeneration in AD and PD, validating the utility of this model for studying the consequences of pigment accumulation in the LC as it relates to neurodegenerative disease. The hTyr approach to producing NM-like pigment in rodent catecholamine neurons allows, for the first time, the in vivo investigation of key questions and mechanisms underlying the relationship between NM and neurodegeneration.

1.9.1 Is LC-NM more toxic than SN-NM?

Carballo-Carbajal and colleagues reported that hTyr-induced NM-like pigment accumulation resulted in the death of SN-DA neurons after ~4 months (50% loss), and ~80% loss after 24 months (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019). By contrast, we observed almost complete degeneration of the LC within 6–10 weeks following viral infusion (Iannitelli et al., 2023). There were many differences between the experimental methods, including virus (AAV2 vs Cre-dependent AAV5) and species (rats vs mice). However, it is also possible that NM produced in the LC is more toxic than NM produced in the SN. For example, various chemical techniques in postmortem human tissue have demonstrated that the composition of LC-NM is distinct from SN-NM (e.g. LC-NM contains DA metabolites and NE-specific metabolites and is enriched in copper, while SN-NM contains mainly DA metabolites and is enriched in iron) (Zecca et al., 2004b; Wakamatsu et al., 2015). LC neurons may also be more vulnerable to NM toxicity than SN cells; LC neurons are affected earlier and to a greater degree than SN neurons in both PD and AD (Zarow et al., 2003).

1.9.2 What is the relative toxicity of intracellular vs extracellular NM?

As discussed above, it is not clear whether NM is damaging inside neurons, outside neurons, or both. In some respects, the evidence for extracellular toxicity is more compelling, since NM can accumulate in catecholamine neurons, apparently benignly, for decades, while application of NM to cultured cells or infusion of purified NM directly into the brain killed SN neurons (Zhang et al., 2011). However, hTyr-induced NM-like pigment expression is driven by a virus that is taken up by catecholamine neurons, leading to the death of SN and LC neurons in the absence of any other insult or mechanism for inducing NM release from those cells. Furthermore, SN cell death was mitigated by enhancing lysosomal proteostasis, suggesting that intracellular NM can also be toxic. The hTyr model lends itself to investigating these questions. For example, ultrastructural analysis of NM-like pigment localization across time can determine the sequence of events leading to cell death. In addition, it should be possible to express hTyr in a subset of LC neurons and monitor whether neighboring hTyr-negative cells are also compromised.

1.9.3 What happens to NM after LC neurons are dead?

Our preliminary results indicate that NM-like pigment persists for weeks following complete loss of LC neurons. There is evidence of NM engulfment by microglia following injection of purified human NM into the rat SN (Zhang et al., 2011), and we have observed astrocyte infiltration of the LC region following neuronal degeneration (Iannitelli et al., 2023), suggesting that glial cells may eventually engulf extracellular NM, but this will require direct testing of hTyr-expressing mice (e.g. ultrastructural analysis of NM granule localization by electron microscopy). It is an important issue because NM-sensitive MRI sequences are currently used to evaluate LC integrity, and persistence of a NM signal after the death of LC neurons could represent a confound to interpreting these images.

1.9.4 What is the relationship between NM and protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative disease?

Given that human neurons accumulate pigment steadily over time, it seems unlikely that NM, on its own, is especially toxic unless it accumulates at a very rapid pace (e.g. in the hTyr rodent models). This suggests that NM may interact with other insults in AD and PD to exacerbate the neurodegenerative process. Indeed, alpha-synuclein has been identified as a component of NM (Halliday et al., 2005), and hTyr expression induces alpha-synuclein pathology in the rat SN (Carballo-Carbajal et al., 2019). By using immunohistochemical or proteomic approaches to quantify alpha-synuclein and tau in the NM-like pigment produced by hTyr in rodents, and inducing hTyr expression in the LC of mice that express various forms of human alpha-synuclein (Butkovich et al., 2020) or tau (Kang et al., 2020), the interaction between these protein aggregates and NM can be explored.

1.9.5 Are there therapeutic interventions that can attenuate neuromelanin toxicity?

Because cytosolic catecholamines and their metabolites are essential components of NM, it stands to reason that interfering with these processes could limit its production and toxicity. However, caution is necessary, as completely eliminating NM could rob LC neurons of a key neuroprotective mechanism. One potentially safe and effective approach is enhancing VMAT2 expression, which sequesters cytosolic catecholamines into synaptic vesicles. This method protects dopamine neurons from MPTP and methamphetamine toxicity (Lohr et al., 2014; Lohr et al., 2015), while inhibition of VMAT2 activity exacerbates LC neuron pathology in mouse models of tauopathy (Kang et al., 2021). A recent study showed that viral-mediated overexpression of VMAT2 in the rat SN decreased hTyr-induced NM-like pigment production and ameliorated dopamine neuron deterioration and motor impairment (Gonzalez-Sepulveda et al., 2023). It seems likely, but not certain, that this approach would also protect LC neurons from NM-induced damage. Among the most harmful NE species is the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL) (Burke et al., 2004; Kang et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Kang et al., 2022), which may contribute to the toxicity of NM. Inhibiting MAO-A and/or increasing the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase or aldehyde reductase, which covert DOPEGAL to 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid (DOMA) and 3,4dihydroxylphenylethyleneglycol/3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPEG/DHPG) respectively, reduces DOPEGAL levels and may be neuroprotective (Burke et al., 2004; Kang et al., 2020). The hTyr-induced NM-like pigment accumulation in the LC is an ideal model to test these and other strategies for therapeutic potential.

1.10 Conclusion

Despite decades of characterization and investigation of NM, we still know precious little about the mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective and neurotoxic properties, particularly in LC neurons. The introduction of the hTyr model of NM-like pigment production in rodents provides a fresh opportunity for testing long-held theories about the contribution of NM to LC dysfunction and loss in neurodegenerative disease. Future work in this area will be critical for interpreting postmortem and live imaging NM data for diagnosis and treatment of AD and PD.

Figure 1. Biosynthesis of Neuromelanin in Locus Coeruleus Neurons

Neuromelanin (NM) is formed as a byproduct of the catecholamine synthesis and metabolism pathway. This pathway begins with the conversation of tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is then synthesized further to form the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA). In the presence of iron (Fe3+) or copper (Cu2+), DA and NE can form quinones, which are toxic to neurons. The auto-oxidation of dopaquinones is believed to contribute directly to the formation of pigment in catecholamine neurons. DA is trafficked into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT), where it is converted to norepinephrine (NE) by the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH). Following vesicular fusion and release upon neuron stimulation, extracellular NE is taken up by the NE transporter (NET) and either repackaged into synaptic vesicles, oxidized by Fe3+ or Cu2+ to form quinones, or converted into the metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL) by the mitochondrial enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). DOPEGAL is eventually converted to the metabolite 3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol MHPG by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). These heavy metal, pigment, and metabolite byproducts bind with protein aggregates in the cell and are collected for degradation by autophagosomes. If the components cannot be degraded fully, the phagosome encloses the components into a membrane, forming the final NM granule.

Figure 2: Properties of Neuromelanin Over Time.

Neuromelanin (NM) accumulates over time with normal aging but its concentration declines as neurons die in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. NM binds heavy metals and toxic catechols in the cytosol, initially serving as a neuroprotective mechanism within the cell. However, NM can become toxic by overwhelming intracellular machinery and/or by harming surrounding cells following release by dying neurons.
