INTRODUCTION:

We developed demographically-adjusted normative data for Spanish- and English-speaking Latinos on the Version 3.0 of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set Neuropsychological Battery (UDS3-NB).

METHODS:

Healthy Latino adults (N=437) age 50–94 (191 Spanish- and 246 English-speaking) enrolled in Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers completed the UDS3-NB in their preferred language. Normative data were developed via multiple linear regression models on UDS3-NB raw scores stratified by language group with terms for demographic characteristics (age, years of formal education, sex).

RESULTS:

Younger age and more years of education were associated with better performance on most tests in both language groups, with education being particularly influential on raw scores among Spanish-speakers. Sex effects varied across tests and language groups.

DISCUSSION:

These normative data are a crucial step towards improving diagnostic accuracy of the UDS3-NB for neurocognitive disorders among Latinos in the U.S. and addressing disparities in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.

pmc1. Background

Hispanics/Latinos/as/es/x (henceforth Latinos) represent the largest ethnic/racial minority group in the United States (U.S.), and the fastest growing ethnic/racial group among the older adult U.S. population1,2. While Latinos in the U.S. tend to share a number of cultural values and experiences, they are a heterogenous group3. Language use is an important dimension of within group variability, with 73% of U.S. Latinos speaking Spanish at home4.

Latinos show increased risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs)5,6 and earlier age of onset of dementia than non-Hispanic Whites7,8. They also experience disparities in dementia diagnosis and care9,10. The National Alzheimer’s Plan Act and the National Institute on Aging have identified addressing ADRD disparities among minoritized populations as a public health priority11,12. An important initial step for addressing such disparities among Latinos involves the development of tools for the accurate detection of MCI and dementia in this group13.

Clinical diagnosis of MCI and dementia is largely based on the interpretation of results of neuropsychological tests. Completing a neuropsychological test is a behavior and, as such, it is impacted by an array of factors in addition to underlying brain function. Demographic characteristics (age, years of education and sex) have consistently been linked to normal variations on neuropsychological test performance. There are also other variables that are more difficult to ascertain that impact test performance, such as cultural and linguistic factors, familiarity with testing, quality of education and stereotype threat, among others. The development of norms for a specific cultural and linguistic group that adjusts for the effect of demographic factors within the population of interest provides data on a reference group that matches a range of characteristics in the population and can improve interpretation of cross-sectional neurocognitive scores and improve diagnostic accuracy for brain disorders14.

The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) involves clinical protocols (including a Neuropsychological Battery) developed for the assessment of MCI and ADRDs, which are utilized by all National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs)15 in the U.S. The UDS has undergone three iterations16,17, and the UDS 2.0 Neuropsychological Battery has normative data available for Spanish-speakers18. The UDS 3.0 Neuropsychological Battery (UDS3-NB) was published in 201516, varies significantly from previous versions, has normative data for English-speakers16,19–21, and successfully distinguishes among stages of cognitive impairment22. Yet, normative data for Latinos are lacking, which poses significant challenges to the interpretation of test scores and limits diagnostic accuracy in this group.

The main goals of the present study were to (1) examine the influence of demographic factors (age, years of formal education, sex) on neuropsychological test performance on the UDS3-NB among healthy Spanish and English-speaking Latino ADRC participants age 50 and older, and (2) generate demographically-adjusted normative data in an effort to improve the utility of this battery for the identification of neurocognitive disorders in this group.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Participants were adults aged 50–94 enrolled in NIA-sponsored ADRCs. Data were collected at 33 ADRCs from 03/2015 to 02/2021, with most of the data (96%) being collected before 03/2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) self-identification as Hispanic/Latino; (2) primarily English or Spanish-speaking; (3) having data available on demographic factors (age, education, sex), the UDS3-NB and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)23 at the same study visit; and (4) receiving a global CDR score of 0 (indicative of ‘normal’ cognitive and behavioral function based on clinical judgment). Data from the first administration of the UDS3-NB were used. Exclusion criteria included report (by participant or informant) of notable neurological (i.e., stroke, more than one transient ischemic attack, Parkinson’s disease, seizures or traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness&gt;5 minutes) or psychiatric conditions (alcohol of other substance abuse, Bipolar disorder, Schizophrenia, or developmental psychiatric disorders). We did not exclude participants with prior administration of another version of the battery or based on their performance on cognitive screening tests16,19. Extreme outliers on raw scores were reviewed by two bilingual clinical neuropsychologists (M.J.M and K.R.) for accuracy and evidence of possible pattern of performance indicative of an underlying neurological disorder. No cases were excluded based on this review and a total of 6 individual datapoints were corrected/deleted because of suspected data entry/collection errors.

Participants were recruited via clinician referral, self-referral, outreach efforts in local communities, and word-of-mouth, though specific recruitment protocols varied by ADRC. Most participants stated that the reason for coming to the ADRC was to participate in a research study (79.4%), with 7.3% coming to have a clinical evaluation, and 13.3% for both reasons. The presence or absence of cognitive concerns was not a criterion for study enrollment and 24.5% of participants reported declines in memory relative to prior levels during the study visit. Data were collected by trained personnel at each ADRC in the participants’ self-reported primary/preferred language based. Participants completed informed consent at the individual ADRCs. Centers received approval to gather data at their Institutional Review Boards.

2.2. Measures

Demographic information (age, years of education, sex, and Latino ethnicity) were ascertained via self-report. Determination of Latino background followed NIH guidelines24.

The UDS3-NB16,25 includes the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)26, a cognitive screening test, and 10 tests assessing several cognitive domains, including attention (Number Span Test)27, processing speed (Trail Making Test Part A; TMT-A)28, executive functioning (Trail Making Test Part B; TMT-B)28, naming (Multilingual Naming Test; MINT)29, phonemic fluency (letters P and M for Spanish-speakers and letters F and L for English-speaking), semantic fluency (Animal and Vegetable Naming), visuospatial skills (Benson Complex Figure [BCF]-Copy)30, and learning and memory (Craft Story 21 [CS-21] Immediate and Recall31, and BCF-Recall)30. In addition to typically used core test scores (e.g., total raw scores)16,19, we examined derived and discrepancy scores (henceforth, derived) that have been previously described21. Derived scores are calculated based on comparisons of performance on different tests within the same person, and thus are likely to be less impacted by demographic factors. Including derived and discrepancy scores is important, as they might improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy by providing a finer interpretation of results and enhancing the identification of cognitive profiles linked to different types of ADRD21.

The Spanish adaptation of the UDS3-NB involved preliminary translation and content review by expert clinicians, and pilot testing at three U.S. and four Latin-American sites, as previously reported25. Pilot testing did not reveal significant issues with the initial Spanish translation for the MoCA, BCF, Number Span Forward and Backward, Animal and Vegetable Naming, and TMT-A and TMT-B. However, adaption was required for the CS-21, Phonemic Fluency, and MINT25.

A subset of participants completed a Linguistic History Form to ascertain language background, including the number of years lived in an environment where people generally spoke Spanish and English, and the percentage of time that participants used these languages during an average day. Participants also rated their proficiency speaking, reading, writing, and understanding spoken Spanish and English, using a scale from 1(Almost None) to 7(Like Native Speaker). Responses to the proficiency questions were averaged to compute an “Average Proficiency Score” in English and Spanish. Consistent with prior procedures32, we estimated relative degree of Spanish-English bilingualism as the ratio of the average proficiency score in Spanish to the sum of the average proficiency scores in Spanish and English (Proficiency in Spanish/[Proficiency in Spanish + Proficiency in English]). Based on this score participants were classified as Spanish-dominant (≥0.67), English-dominant (≤0.33) or bilingual (0.34–0.66)32.

2.3. Statistical Analyses

We computed descriptive statistics of demographic factors (e.g., age, education, sex, Latino background, and handedness) in the overall cohort and separately for Spanish- and English- speakers, and we compared language groups on these variables via independent sample t-tests (for continuous variables) and Chi-Square tests (for categorical variables). We ran similar analyses on demographic and language background characteristics in the subset of the sample with available data on the Language History Form.

We computed descriptive statistics of raw cognitive test scores, examined their distribution via Shapiro-Wilk tests, and compared language groups on these variables via independent sample t-test, and via linear regression models adjusting for demographic variables that differed between groups. A series of multiple linear regression models were run on each raw cognitive test score, separately in Spanish- and English-speaking Latinos, with terms for age (continuous), years of formal education (continuous), and sex (categorical) to investigate the independent association of each of these variables on neurocognitive test performance. To determine the relative importance of each of the demographic factors, we calculated partial correlation coefficients based on squared semipartial correlation which measured incremental value in R2.

Similar to prior work on the UDS3-NB among English-speakers19, we examined curvilinear relationships by adding quadratic terms of centered age and years of education, and compared R2 between linear and quadratic regression models. Consistent with prior work in neuropsychological norm development among Spanish-speakers33, we applied fractional polynomial methods, which considered linear and non-linear effects of age and education, and selected the best curve from linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and other combinations of fractional polynomials of first (e.g. xm) and second degree (e.g. xm1 + xm2) with powers (mi) ranging from −2 to +3. To do so, we first converted individual cognitive test raw scores to normalized Scaled Scores by measuring standardized quantiles of the raw scores and scaling them to have a mean of 10 and standard deviation (SD) of 3, with higher values indicating better performance. T-Scores for measures with adequate distribution were obtained by applying fractional polynomial equations to regressed Scaled Scores on age, education, and sex, and rescaling the resulting residuals to have mean=50 and SD=10. We present as our main results the linear models to be consistent with previous UDS3-NB norms in English-speakers16,19, and present the quadratic and fractional polynomial models in supplementary tables. The test score normalization and fractional polynomial models were conducted using R Statistical Software34 with the test2norm35 and mfp36 packages. All other analyses were conducted in SAS software, Version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and JMP v16.0.

3. Results

3.1. Demographic and language characteristics of the study sample

A total of 437 NACC participants (191 primarily Spanish-speaking and 246 English-speaking) met inclusion criteria for the present analyses. Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of the overall study sample and by primary language. Overall, mean age was in the low 70s, mean education was slightly above high school, and nearly three-quarters of the sample was female. Women tended to be overrepresented in the lower education ranges (Supplemental Table 1). Latino background was quite diverse, with nearly half of the overall sample being of Mexican origin/descent.

Participants who were primarily Spanish-speaking were older and had fewer years of education than English-speakers, with no significant group differences in sex. While there was overlap in years of education between Spanish- and English-speakers, none of the English-speaking participants had completed ≤6 years of education, and a very small percent completed 7–10 years of education. In contrast, nearly a quarter of the Spanish-speaking sample had ≤6 years of education and nearly 40% had &lt;11 years of education. Compared to English-speakers, the Spanish-speaking group had a lower proportion of Latinos of Mexican background (p=.02), and a greater proportion of Latinos of Dominican (p=.01) and South American (p&lt;.001) backgrounds.

Supplemental Table 2 presents demographic and language background characteristics of a subset of participants who completed the Language History Form (N=155, 113 Spanish-speaking and 42 English-speaking). Spanish-and English-speaking Latinos significantly differed in the expected direction in their language history, use and proficiency. There was a greater proportion of bilingual individuals in the English-speaking compared to the Spanish-speaking group.

3.2. Descriptive characteristics of raw neuropsychological test scores

Descriptive characteristics of raw neurocognitive scores by language group are presented in Table 2. Spanish-speakers obtained worse raw scores than English-speakers on most tests in univariable analyses (Table 2), and after adjusting for demographics that differed significantly between groups (i.e., age and education; Supplemental Table 3). Most raw scores were not normally distributed. The only raw scores that were normally distributed in both language groups were Animal Naming, CS-21 Delay (Verbatim), and Verbal Fluency Discrepancy. Among Spanish Speakers, raw scores of Phonemic Fluency, CS-21 Immediate (verbatim and paraphrase), CS-21 Delay (paraphrase), and Verbal Visual Retention Discrepancy were also normally distributed.

Examination of the distribution of raw scores showed that 45 participants (10.98%) reached the time limit for the TMT-B (5 minutes), with 41 of them completing the TMT-A within the allotted 2.5 minutes. A total of 9 participants (2%) did not complete the TMT-A within the time limit. Reaching the time limit on the TMT-B was strongly linked to primary language and education (Supplement Figure 1). Eighty-four percent of participants who reached the time limit were Spanish-speakers (38/45). Regarding education, 45% of participants with ≤6 years of education and 38% with 7–10 years of education did not complete the task within the time limit, compared to 16% of those with 11–12 years and less than 5% of participants with &gt;12 years of education.

3.3. Associations of demographic characteristics with raw neuropsychological test scores

Tables 3A and 3B show results from multiple linear regression models on raw test scores within each language group, with terms for age (continuous), years of education (continuous), and sex. Among Spanish-speakers (Table 3A), model R2 values ranged from 0.10 to 0.41 on core tests and from 0.01 to 0.075 on derived scores. Among English-speakers (Table 3B), model R2 values ranged from 0.08 to 0.20 on core tests and from 0.01 to 0.08 on derived scores.

Regarding core tests, among Spanish-speakers, education was the most important predictor of performance on all tests except for Vegetable Naming, for which sex was the most important predictor. Among English-speakers, education was also the most important predictor of performance on several tests, but age was the most important predictor for the TMT-A time, Number Span Backward Longest Span, BFC-Copy and BFC-Recall. Increased age was significantly associated with worse performance on the MoCA, TMT-A time, Animal Naming and BCF-Recall in both language groups. Age was also associated with worse scores on the MINT among Spanish-speakers, and on the BCF-Copy among English-speakers. Having more years of education was a significant predictor of better performance on all but one test among Spanish-speakers, and on several tests among English-speakers. Female sex was associated with better raw scores on Vegetable Naming in both language groups and better performance on CS-21 Recall Immediate (Verbatim and Paraphrase) among English-speakers only. Regarding derived test scores, few demographic factors were significantly associated with raw scores. In the cases where they were, age was the most important predictor among Spanish-speakers, and age and education among English-speakers.

The formulas presented in Table 3A and 3B were used to develop a calculator to facilitate the computation of z scores (Supplemental Material). Supplemental Tables 4A and 4B show raw-to-percentile conversions without demographic adjustments for core test scores with highly skewed distributions (i.e., TMT-A and TMT-B Errors, and Phonemic Fluency Perseverations and Intrusions).

Supplemental Tables 5A and 5B show results when adding quadratic terms for age and education in models among Spanish- and English-speakers, respectively. The quadratic terms were almost never statistically significant (with the exception of education with TMT-A and Error Index Score among Spanish-speakers), and model R2 values generally only increased slightly when quadratic terms were added. Supplemental Tables 6A-6D show conversions from raw scores to Scaled Scores, and Supplemental Tables 7A and 7B show T-score equations derived from fractional polynomial models. This methodology allowed for the consideration of nonlinear effects of age and education, yet in most cases the models selected linear effects of these variables as the best fit.

4. Discussion

The present study provides demographically-adjusted normative data on the UDS3-NB among Spanish and English-speaking Latinos age 50–94 enrolled in ADRCs. We provide an online calculator for easy implementation in research and clinical practice of the current normative data for core and derived measures based on results of linear regression models. Results from other statistical methods that consider non-linear effects of continuous demographic variables (age, education) indicate that a linear fit was best for most tests on the UDS3-NB in the current sample. In the small number of tests where a non-linear effect was stronger, the advantage was relatively small. Because of this and to be consistent with prior UDS3-NB studies among English-speakers16,19, we developed the calculator based on results from linear regression models.

Consistent with prior findings on the UDS3-NB20, Spanish-speakers obtained lower raw scores than English-speaking Latinos on most neurocognitive tests, even after adjusting for group differences in age and education, suggesting that cultural/linguistic factors influence normal test performance beyond basic demographic adjustments. There is also evidence that a notable proportion of Latinos with few years of education, particularly Spanish-speakers, might be unable to complete the TMT-B within the allotted time. Nearly half of participants with ≤6 years of education (all Spanish-speaking), did not complete the task within the allotted time. This might be due to limited alphabet proficiency and/or brief administration time. This indicates that this test may need to be modified (e.g., less items or allow for longer completion times) or that utilizing scores considering the number of lines/completion time might be best for some subgroups of Latinos. Knowledge of the alphabet should also be assessed before administration of this test.

As in prior studies16,19, younger age and more years of formal education were independently associated with better raw test performance on several UDS3-NB core tests in both language groups. Among Spanish-speakers, higher education was the most important predictor of better performance on all core tests except for Vegetable Naming. Among English-speakers, education was also the most important predictor of performance on several core tests, but age was most important for predicting performance on tests of processing speed, working memory, visuo-construction and visual memory. These differential demographic associations by language group lend support for the development of demographically-adjusted normative data separately for Spanish- and English-speaking Latinos.

The effect of sex on neuropsychological test performance was notable for women performing better than men on a semantic fluency task involving naming vegetables in both language groups. This advantage was not evident for a similar semantic fluency task that involved naming animals, suggesting that the semantic fluency advantage is specific to the category of vegetables. While the present data do not identify the factors driving these or other demographic differences, the specificity of this advantage might be related to the traditional involvement of women within the Latino culture in food preparation.

Women also outperformed men on a verbal learning task among English-speakers in analyses considering other demographics, which is consistent with prior findings in English-speakers37. It has been argued that such advantage may allow women to maintain memory scores within normal limits for longer, despite underlying Alzheimer’s disease pathology, delaying an MCI diagnosis in women until a more advanced disease stage with faster decline thereafter38. Interestingly, such advantage was not observed among Spanish-speakers further highlighting the need to consider culture/language in studies examining sex and neuropsychological test performance in aging39.

Demographic factors had little influence on derived neuropsychological measures, which is likely due to these scores being calculated based on intraindividual comparisons of test performance. The inclusion of the newly developed UDS3-NB derived scores40 in the present normative study has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy among Latinos40.

The present study has limitations that should be considered. Participants were recruited from ADRCs, which might limit the generalizability of results to all Latinos in the U.S.20. NACC participants are not an epidemiologically based sample of the U.S. population, but are best regarded as a referral-based or volunteer case series selected based on each center’s research focus. However, the inclusion of Latinos from a range of backgrounds and regions in the U.S. allowed for the representation of diverse groups of Latinos. Second, the current sample is considerably smaller than that of prior UDS3-NB normative studies, and thus current norms might be less robust than those available for non-Hispanic English-speakers. Relatedly, the relatively small sample size prevented examination of the influence of culturally-relevant factors that were assessed in the present study, such as Latino background. Language use history was assessed only by self-report and in a subset of participants, and other culturally-relevant factors such as acculturation, literacy and quality of education, among others, were not assessed. There were differences in self-reported bilingualism across Spanish-and English speakers in the present study, and prior findings among Latinos indicate bilingualism might need to be considered in demographic adjustments32. Because of limitations of the available data, we did not examine bilingualism in the present study. Importantly, though, language histories were consistent with participants’ language group, lending support for self-reported language preference as a marker of primary language. Future large normative studies that include Latinos from diverse backgrounds living in diverse regions in the U.S. and that include comprehensive assessments of culturally-relevant factors would assure that factors important to neuropsychological test performance are considered in the development of norms for Latinos in the U.S.

As is the case for most normative studies, the present study was not designed to advance our understanding of the factors underlying the observed normal variations on neuropsychological test performance by demographic factors and language group (e.g., gender roles, quality and access to education, acculturation, immigration history, childhood environment/resources, among others). Future studies examining such mechanisms are crucial for the advancement of science aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological tests across diverse groups. Furthermore, while the use of culture/language-specific demographically-adjusted normative data can improve diagnostic accuracy14,41, future studies including groups of persons with known neurological dysfunction should examine this question directly. It is also important to consider that a thorough understanding of the use and misuse of demographically-adjusted normative data14 is crucial for conducting valid, meaningful neuropsychological evaluations and data interpretations with culturally/linguistically diverse populations.

5. Conclusion

Present findings contribute to addressing the dearth of neuropsychological tools for the identification of underlying brain dysfunction among Latinos in the U.S. They stand to improve diagnostic accuracy among Latinos of a neuropsychological test battery that is widely used across studies of ADRD, and advance clinical practice and research in this group. They might also facilitate the use of UDS protocols among Latinos, supporting existing calls to diversify enrollment in aging research. As such, results are a crucial step towards addressing ADRD disparities among Latinos in the U.S.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review.

Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers in the United States (U.S.) have utilized the Uniform Data Set Version 3 Neuropsychological Battery (UDS3-NB) since 2015. Yet, there are no normative data available on this battery for Latinos, who are the fastest growing ethnic/racial group among older adults in the U.S.

Interpretation.

We provide demographically-adjusted normative data on the UDS3-NB for Spanish and English-speaking Latinos age 50–94 living in the U.S. These findings are an important step towards improving early detection and diagnostic accuracy of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and addressing disparities among Latinos.

Future Directions.

Large normative studies that include Latinos in the U.S. from diverse backgrounds living in varied regions in the U.S. and that include comprehensive assessments of culturally-relevant factors (e.g., Latino background, multilingualism, literacy, acculturation, education quality) would determine whether inclusion of these factors in the development of norms for Latinos in the U.S. is warranted.

HIGHLIGHTS

We developed normative data on the UDS3-NB for Latinos in the U.S. ages 50–94

Younger age and more years of education were linked to better cognitive raw scores

Education was particularly influential on raw scores among Spanish-speakers

Sex effects varied across tests and between English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos

These normative data might improve diagnostic accuracy of the UDS3-NB among Latinos
