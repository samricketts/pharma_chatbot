Objective:

To describe clinical features, [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET metabolism and digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive aphasia and pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (LPA-DLBD) and compare to LPA patients with other pathologies, as well as patients with classical features of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB).

Methods:

This is a clinico-pathologic case-control study of 45 patients, including 20 prospectively recruited LPA patients among whom six with LPA-DLBD. We analyze clinical features and compare FDG-PET metabolism in LPA-DLBD to an independent group of clinical pDLB patients and regional α-synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and ante mortem pDLB (DLB-DLBD).

Results:

All LPA-DLBD patients were men. Neurological, speech and neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA-DLBD, LPA-Alzheimer disease (LPA-AD) and LPA-frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA-FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD and FTLD linked genes were negative. Seventy-five percent of LPA-DLBD patients showed a parietal-dominant pattern of hypometabolism; LPA-FTLD – temporal-dominant pattern whereas LPA-AD showed heterogeneous patterns of hypometabolism. LPA-DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the non-dominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA-DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts and higher α-synuclein burden in middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB-DLBD.

Interpretation:

Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to α-synuclein-associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe.


Introduction

Logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA), a variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA)1, is a neurodegenerative language disorder. LPA is characterized by hesitant spontaneous speech due to word-finding difficulties frequently accompanied by phonologic errors and impaired retention and repetition of long and complex spoken stimuli, however, LPA is not associated with apraxia of speech or definite impairment of grammar2. Clinico-pathologic studies of LPA patients found the most common underlying pathology to be Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with the remaining minority being due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)3,4. In rare instances, other pathologies, such as Lewy body disease (LBD), have been identified often co-occurring with intermediate-to-high-likelihood AD5-10 raising the question of whether any other pathologies could be playing a role in the LPA syndrome.

Neuropathologic examination of LPA patients who came to autopsy at our center revealed a significant proportion with Lewy body pathology, ranging from focal deposition to diffuse LBD (DLBD) as a pathologic diagnosis. Therefore, it is unclear whether clinical features of LPA are unrelated to LBD, particularly DLBD.

We, therefore, set out to investigate the clinico-pathologic and neuroimaging associations of our LPA patients that had a brain autopsy performed. The primary aim of this study was to compare demographic, clinical (neurological, speech/language, neuropsychological), genetic, neuropathologic and neuroimaging profiles in our autopsy cohort of LPA grouped by their pathologic diagnosis and severity. We also aimed to investigate how LPA patients with a pathologic diagnosis of DLBD (LPA-DLBD) differed from patients who had presented clinically as probable DLB with respect to both pathology and neuroimaging.

Materials and methods

Logopenic progressive aphasia autopsy group

We identified all patients who had been prospectively recruited in a National Institute of Health funded grant study between 2010 and 2015, had completed a research battery of tests, received an LPA diagnosis by consensus and completed a brain autopsy at death. From sixty-four patients with an LPA diagnosis 17 had an autopsy. All patients underwent longitudinal neurological, neuropsychological and speech/language evaluations.

Three additional LPA-DLBD cases from the brain bank

We reviewed the neuropathologic brain bank database at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL to identify all cases with antemortem LPA and DLBD finding three additional patients with antemortem diagnosis of LPA (patients 4, 5, 6) evaluated at Mayo Clinic-Rochester, Mayo Clinic-Jacksonville, and Medical College of Wisconsin, WI, respectively. All had been evaluated by a board certified behavioral neurologist, had undergone detailed neuropsychological testing and had neuroimaging available for review.

Dementia with Lewy bodies autopsy group

From our autopsy confirmed DLBD cases we randomly selected 15 patients with antemortem clinical diagnosis of probable DLB11 (pDLB) and brain tissue available for digital pathologic burden analysis, hereafter, referred to as DLB-DLBD.

Probable dementia with Lewy bodies clinical group

We randomly selected ten patients recently evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, by a behavioral neurologist (JGR) who met clinical criteria for pDLB at the initial evaluation11 and completed an FDG-PET study.

Clinical data and scores for neurologic, speech/language and neuropsychologic tests at initial evaluation were used in this study for LPA autopsy and pDLB clinical groups.

Genetic analyses

All 20 patients in LPA autopsy groups underwent genetic evaluation for apolipoprotein E (APOE) and mutations in the progranulin (GRN), microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) and C9ORF72 gene. All LPA-DLBD cases had MAPT haplotype determination and were screened for mutations in the α-synuclein (SNCA: A53T, A30P), presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and amyloid protein precursor (APP) genes.

Standard protocols approvals, registrations and patient consents

This study has been approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board, and all patients and/or their proxies signed a written informed consent form before taking part in any research activities in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Pathologic evaluation

All autopsied cases had undergone standard neuropathologic examination following cortical sampling according to CERAD12 with thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy used to assign Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage13, Thal phase14, neuritic plaque density and cerebral amyloid angiopathy scores15. Diagnoses of AD, LBD, and FTLDTDP-43 were established according to consensus recommendations11, 16, 17. Patients with AD pathology were subtyped into typical AD (ADTyp) and hippocampal sparing AD (ADHpSp) variants as previously described18. Lewy body disease was staged according to the scheme proposed by Braak et al.19 The likelihood of LBD to express DLB clinical phenotype based on the severity of the LBD and the AD pathologies when co-occuring was determined according to International Consortium for DLB criteria11.

In non-FTLD brains, trans-active response DNA-binding protein 43kDa (TDP-43) pathology was considered present when identified in the amygdala20. TDP-43 morphological type-α or type-β were assigned as previously described21. Hippocampal sclerosis was diagnosed based on consensus recommendations22 and argyrophilic grains disease (AGD) as previously described23.

Arteriolosclerosis and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra were rated semi-quantitatively as none, mild, moderate, and severe.

Quantitative neuropathologic analyses

Senile plaque and NFT counts were reported for the LPA patients for middle frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal cortices, cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and subiculum. Lewy bodies were counted for both autopsy groups in middle frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyri, and amygdala.

Patients with LPA-DLBD and DLB-DLBD underwent burden analysis for α-synuclein, tau, and amyloid-beta via immunohistochemistry and image analysis with ImageScope software (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA)24.

Establishment of logopenic progressive aphasia diagnosis

Prospective video recordings of speech/language evaluations were reviewed by two speech-language pathologists blinded (JRD, EAS) to the neurological, neuropsychological and neuroimaging results who rendered a consensus diagnosis of LPA based on published criteria1, 2. To receive an LPA diagnosis, aphasia had to be the only or principal complaint and the cause for an alteration of activities of daily living and speech/language and neurological examination findings must be characteristic of, and consistent with, LPA which could not have been better accounted for by another medical or neurological disorder, including but not limited to, another aphasia diagnosis. In the LPA-DLBD cases identified from brain bank the LPA diagnoses were established by a behavioral neurologists (NRGF, MBF) during the clinical visit supported by clinical neuropsychological (BKR) and/or speech/language examinations.

Neurological evaluation

All neurological examination was performed by an experienced board certified behavioral neurologist (KAJ). The following battery of tests was applied: Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE); Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI); Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Questionnaire (NPI-Q); and the Movement Disorders Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III).

Speech and language evaluation

The speech/language assessment was performed by an experienced speech-language pathologist for the LPA autopsy cohort patients and included the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB). Global language ability and aphasia severity was expressed as WAB Aphasia Quotient (AQ). The following tests were used for different speech/language domains: repetition – WAB-Repetition; naming – 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT); object knowledge – Pyramids and Palm Trees (PPT) test; verbal comprehension – Token Test part V. Repetition was considered abnormal if WAB-Repetition score was &lt; 9.77 which is 2 standard deviations lower than the published mean score of healthy controls25 Standardized writing samples from the WAB were reviewed for evidence of agrammatism2. Phonologic errors were qualitatively classified by the consensus of two speech-language pathologists as mild, moderate or severe based on the frequency of their occurrence in speech; a rating of moderate-severe was given if phonologic errors occurred frequently (≥25% of utterances) in both conversational speech and during repetition tasks.

Neuropsychological evaluation

Neuropsychological evaluation of LPA patients was overseen by an experienced neuropsychologist (MMM) independent of the neurological and speech/language assessments. Cognitive domains were assessed by the following tests: memory–Visual Reproduction I/II (VRI/II) subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale III (WMS III); processing speed–Trail Making Test(TMT) part A; executive function – Delis-Kaplan Executive Function Sorting test (D-KEFS ST); visuospatial and visuoperceptual functioning–Object and Space Perception (VOSP) cube and incomplete letters subtests, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF). Norms used in this study have been previously described26.

Severity of non-aphasic impairment (none, mild, more than mild) was assigned based on performance in tests assessing cognitive function outside of language domain27.

Neuroimaging

[18F]-FDG-PET imaging

Antemortem

FDG-PET scans were available for the majority of the LPA autopsy group (n = 18) and for all pDLB patients. All PET scans were performed using a GE PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) operating in 3D mode. Briefly, patients were injected with ~459MBq (range 367-576MBq) of 18F-FDG and after a 30-minute uptake period an 8-minute 18F-FDG scan was performed. Emission data was reconstructed into a 256x256 matrix with a 30-cm field of view (Pixel size=1.0mm, slice thickness=1.96mm). Individual-level patterns of hypometabolism were assessed using 3D stereotactic surface projections28 using CortexID (GE Healthcare) whereby activity at each voxel is z-scored to an age-segmented normative database. Predominantly temporal, parietal, or temporoparietal pattern of FDG hypometabolism was assigned as previously described29. FDG-PET scans closest to death were used.

Dominantly affected hemisphere was defined as hemisphere with greater degree of hypometabolism on FDG-PET. The z-scores from lateral prefrontal, lateral temporal, superior parietal, inferior parietal, lateral occipital, and primary visual regions were calculated for each hemisphere and compared across LPA patients grouped by pathologic diagnosis. The z-scores for the same regions were calculated for pDLB patients and compared to LPA-DLBD patients. Asymmetry scores, reflecting the absolute difference in z-scores between hemispheres, were calculated for each region-of-interest (ROI) and compared between LPA-DLBD and pDLB patients.

Molecular PET imaging with Pittsburg Compound B (PiB) and flortaucipir

Sixteen of the 20 LPA patients had antemortem amyloid-beta PET imaging with PiB and two had flortaucipir PET. For PiB-PET, patients were injected with ~628 MBq (range, 385-723MBq) of PiB and after a 40 minute uptake period, a 20-minute PiB scan was obtained. For tau-PET, patients were injected with ~370MBq (range, 333-407MBq) of [18F]AV-1451, followed by a 20-minute PET acquisition performed 80 minutes after injection. Emission data were reconstructed as described for FDG-PET. Global PiB SUVR was calculated as previously described with a cut-point of 1.48 used to define PiB-PET positivity 30. Flortaucipir PET images were divided by uptake in the cerebellar crus grey matter to create SUVR images.

Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics were used for demographic, clinical and pathologic characteristics of LPA autopsy group patients separated by pathologic diagnoses. No formal analyses of statistical difference were performed across pathologies in LPA due to small subgroup sizes.

Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare asymmetry and z-scores of FDG-PET ROIs between LPA-DLBD and pDLB patients as well as Lewy body counts and burden of α-synuclein, tau and Aβ between LPA-DLBD and DLB-DLBD. All statistical analyses were performed in JMP software (version 15; SAS Institute). Significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Figures were generated in RStudio software (version 1.2.5042; RStudio Inc.).

Results

Patients in the LPA autopsy group (n=17) had the following distribution of pathologic diagnoses: 71% (n=12) Alzheimer’s disease – 58% (n=7) had typical AD (LPA-ADTyp), 42% (n=5) had hippocampal sparing AD (LPA-ADHpSp); 41% (n=7) positive for Lewy body pathology of which 18% (n=3) had DLBD (LPA-DLBD); 12% (n=2) had frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, type A (LPA-FTLDTDP-43). With the three additional LPA-DLBD cases identified from the Mayo Clinic brain bank database the total LPA-DLBD cohort was composed of six cases.

Demographics, genetic and clinical characteristics of LPA patients

Demographic, genetic and clinical characteristics of the LPA autopsy patients grouped by pathologic diagnoses are summarized in Table 1. In all pathologies, men were more frequent than women with all LPA-DLBD and LPA–FTLDTDP-43 patients being male. The LPA-DLBD patients had the highest frequency of family history of dementia and the shortest median disease duration (onset-death); it was also the only group where any of the core features of DLB were present, although not sufficient to meet current diagnostic criteria for pDLB. Overtime, two patients met pDLB criteria prior to death and three met criteria for possible DLB. Two patients were placed on cholinesterase inhibitor therapy and both experienced rapid temporary improvement of cognitive performance, measured with bedside testing (Supplementary Table 1). The LPA-DLBD patients had the highest median score on MDS-UPDRS-III and FBI tests.

On the other hand, the LPA-ADHpSp patients had the lowest frequency of family history, the longest disease duration and the lowest median scores on the MMSE and MoCA. The LPA-FTLDTDP-43 patients had a younger median age at onset and better scores on the MMSE and MoCA.

The APOE ε4 allele was present in 83% of cases with LPA-DLBD; 58% of patients with AD; 50% of LPA-FTLDTDP-43. Both LPA-FTLDTDP-43 patients screened positive for a GRN mutations: c.912G&gt;A (p.T304X); c.139delG (p.D47TfsX7). All other genes screened were negative for mutations.

Speech, language and neuropsychological characteristics of LPA patients

Speech/language and neuropsychological characteristics of the LPA cohort are summarized in Table 2. LPA-DLBD patients demonstrated typical LPA features including hesitancy of spontaneous speech due to word-findings difficulties (Video 1), anomia without loss of word meaning, phonologic errors and impaired repetition of long sentences (Video 2). LPA-DLBD also had the lowest median ROCF score. The LPA-ADHpSp patients had the lowest median scores on all other speech/language and neuropsychological tests, had the highest frequency of phonologic errors and were the most impaired outside of the language domain. The LPA-ADTyp patients, on the other hand, performed the best on the WAB, had infrequent phonologic errors in most cases and were the only group with patients without non-aphasic cognitive deficits.

Gross pathologic characteristics of the LPA patients

Pathologic characteristics of the LPA cohort are summarized in Table 3. On gross neuropathologic examination, LPA-DLBD patients had the largest brains whereas LPA-FTLDTDP43 had the highest degree of cortical atrophy despite the lowest frequency of co-pathologies.

Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC)

In addition to the 12 patients with a pathologic diagnosis of AD, five of the six (83%) LPA-DLBD patients had ADNC of low (n=2), intermediate (n=3) or high (n=1) likelihood. Compared to all 12 LPA-AD patients, the LPA-DLBD patients had the lowest median Braak NFT stage, diffuse and neuritic plaque scores, as well as lower subcortical senile plaque and NFT counts. The LPA–ADHpSp patients, as expected, had higher cortical and lower hippocampal NFT counts when compared to LPA-ADTyp.

Lewy body and α-synuclein pathology

In addition to the LPA-DLBD patients, 33% of patients with a pathologic diagnosis of AD had concomitant Lewy bodies: 75% limited to the amygdala and 25% being transitional/limbic. Hence, in total 41%(7/17) of the cohort had Lewy body disease. All patients with LPA-DLBD had moderate to severe neuronal loss in the substantia nigra whereas in the LPA-AD group none or mild neuronal loss in substantia nigra was observed. Five of the six (83%) LPA-DLBD patients had a high likelihood of expressing DLB phenotype and one had intermediate likelihood11.

Additional co-pathologies

Non-FTLD TDP-43 proteinopathy was detected in 39% of cases (excluding the two cases with LPA-FTLDTDP-43) with the highest frequency in the LPA-DLBD (n=4; 67%). The most frequent morphological TDP-43 type was NFT-associated (type β). None of LPA–ADHpSp patients had TDP-43-positive inclusions. LPA–ADTyp patients had the highest burden of additional pathologies including hippocampal sclerosis and AGD.

Cerebrovascular pathologies such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy and arteriolosclerosis were frequent in all groups except for LPA-FTLDTDP-43 with highest frequency of comorbid vascular pathology identified in the LPA–ADHpSp.

Neuroimaging characteristics of LPA patients

Neuroimaging characteristics of the LPA autopsy group are summarized in Table 2. The majority of the LPA-DLBD patients had a predominantly parietal pattern of FDG-PET hypometabolism (Fig 1). The LPA-ADHpSp patients most frequently had a temporoparietal pattern of FDG-PET hypometabolism, while both LPA-FTLDTDP-43 patients had a focal unilateral temporal pattern of FDG-PET hypometabolism (Fig 1). The LPA-ADTyp group showed a roughly equal distribution of patterns of FDG-PET hypometabolism among the seven patients. The lateral temporal lobe showed the greatest hypometabolism in LPA-ADHpSp, the least hypometabolism was in LPA-DLBD in the dominantly affected hemisphere (Fig 2). The LPA-FTLDTDP-43 patients showed less hypometabolism than other groups in the prefrontal, inferior and superior parietal and occipital lobes. Four of the 18 patients (22%) had more right hemisphere predominant hypometabolism. Most LPA patients, regardless underlying pathology, had asymmetrical hypometabolism.

All LPA-DLBD and LPA-AD patients with amyloid-beta PET were eventually PiB-positive whereas both LPA-FTLDTDP-43 patients were negative; one LPA-DLBD patient had an early negative PiB PET. The LPA-ADTyp group had the highest median PiB-PET SUVR ratio. Flortaucipir PET, completed in one LPA-DLBD patient 6-years from onset showed essentially absent ligand uptake with only slight focal uptake in the left inferior temporal lobe. In contrast, flortaucipir PET in one LPA-ADTyp patient showed high uptake throughout the cortex (Fig 3).

Pathologic differences between LPA-DLBD and DLB-DLBD

When compared to the 15 DLB-DLBD patients, the six LPA-DLBD patients had significantly higher total cortical Lewy body counts, particularly in middle frontal and inferior parietal, but not temporal, regions (Fig 4A). Lewy body counts were also higher in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the LPA-DLBD patients (p=0.045).

With quantitative digital neuropathology, the burden of α-synuclein pathology was greater in the middle frontal region in LPA-DLBD compared to DLB-DLBD, with trends for higher cortical α-synuclein burden in inferior parietal region as well as the total cortical burden (Fig 4B). The burden of tau and amyloid-beta deposition did not differ between the groups in any region (Fig 4C, D).

FDG-PET differences between LPA-DLBD and pDLB

Out of ten patients with pDLB, six (60%) were male with median (range) age at onset of symptoms 71 (52-77) years, and time from onset to FDG-PET scan - 3 (1.6-.5) years; MMSE and MoCA scores at the initial evaluation were 23 (8- 30) and 16 (1-26), respectively. None of the regional comparisons of asymmetry and z-scores between LPA-DLBD and pDLB patients reached statistical significance likely due to the modest sample size; however, a number of important trends were observed. The patients with LPA-DLBD tended to have more hypometabolism in the prefrontal ROI of the dominantly affected hemisphere compared to the pDLB patients, p=0.138 (Fig 5A). When comparing the less affected hemispheres, the LPA-DLBD patients had a relatively spared occipital lobe, p=0.066 (Fig 5B). The LPA-DLBD patients also had more asymmetrical patterns of hypometabolism in all ROIs with the exception of the superior parietal ROI when compared to pDLB (Fig 5C).

Discussion

In this study including 17 prospectively followed autopsied LPA patients, 41% had LBD of which DLBD affected almost 20%, a higher than expected frequency. We found differences in demographic, clinical and imaging profiles of the LPA-DLBD patients when compared to those with other pathologies that may be useful in distinguishing them in the future. In LPA patients with AD pathology split into typical and hippocampal sparing AD, the latter appeared to be associated with a more severe phenotype, albeit the absence of TDP-43. Finally, we found evidence of higher α-synuclein burden in LPA-DLBD when compared with DLB-DLBD, primarily in parietal and frontal regions. Lastly, there were trends for differences in the FDG-PET neocortical patterns of metabolism between patients with LPA-DLBD and those with the classic features of DLB.

This series reports the highest proportion of LBD in an LPA prospective cohort when compared with other studies. Of the 17 prospectively recruited patients 7 (41%) had Lewy bodies. In four of these seven cases, the Lewy bodies were amygdala-predominant or transitional/limbic, and occurred in the context of advanced AD. Hence, it is unlikely that in these four cases LBD was contributing much, if at all, to the LPA phenotype. On the other hand, of the six cases with DLBD (3 prospective +3 additional cases) all met intermediate-high probability of the LBD pathology accounting for the clinical phenotype11. In fact, all but one had high probability of the LBD pathology accounting for the clinical phenotype. It could, therefore, be argued that the cortical LBD pathology may be contributing to the LPA phenotype in these patients. Whilst on one hand it could be argued that the NFT pathology is equally likely a determinant of the clinical phenotype, NFT would not be expected to account for the phenotype in the two cases with low likelihood ADNC. In fact, one case did not have any NFTs and the other had no NFTs in temporal or parietal lobes. A third case with Braak IV stage at death showed flortaucipir uptake 6-years from symptom onset and was amyloid-beta negative at baseline examination hence highly inconsistent with underlying AD. Furthermore, we found that LPA-DLBD had significantly greater LBD counts and higher α-synuclein burden compared to DLB-DLBD supporting the notion that the α-synuclein pathology may be playing a role in the LPA phenotype. A parallel study reporting DLBD presenting as corticobasal syndrome found more Lewy bodies in the motor cortex compared to those with DLB-DLBD, suggesting that atypical variants of LBD can present clinically as corticobasal syndrome24. Taking into account the findings on FDG-PET and the fact that LPA-DLBD patients showed relatively little atrophy on gross brain inspection, we speculate that the LPA phenotype in the DLBD patients may be a result of functional, more than structural (atrophy) damage to the parietal, less so temporal, lobe possibly due to aggregation of phosphorylated α-synuclein in presynaptic terminals31. In reviewing the literature, there have been a few cases in which DLBD was documented in patients with LPA and advanced AD pathology 5-7, but also a case report of LPA progressing to DLB with negative AD CSF biomarkers32.Five of six LPA-DLBD cases evolved and over time developed typical DLB features, with two meeting criteria for pDLB prior to death; one of them (patient 3) has been recently published as a single case report10. In one patient the Capgras syndrome was noted while another had a positive dopamine transporter (DaT) scan, features that are associated with DLB33, 34 These findings, therefore, raise the question of whether LPA can indeed be an early manifestation of DLBD.

There are a number of clues that might strengthen the hypothesis of DLBD contribution to LPA syndrome. First, all LPA-DLBD patients were male; therefore, male sex in LPA might be associated with LBD. In fact, male sex association with DLB was observed in two large population-based studies on DLB35, 36. A positive family history was also frequently reported in the LPA-DLBD patients indicating a greater inheritability potential for this pathologic group. The majority of the LPA-DLBD patients were carriers of the APOEε4 allele, a known risk factor for LBD37, however, the significance of APOEε4 is unclear and might be of lesser importance in LPA given it is also associated with both AD and TDP-43 pathologies38, 39. Co-occurrence of LPA with any of the clinical core features of DLB, significantly impaired performance on executive function tasks, as well as rapid improvement of cognitive performance upon initiation of cholinesterase inhibitor therapy should prompt a consideration of DLB. Noteworthy, cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in such patients might improve aphasia9, 40.

Interestingly, the caregivers of the LPA-DLBD patients endorsed more behaviors on the FBI compared to the other LPA pathologies. We did not, however, appreciate a higher degree of frontal lobe hypometabolism on FDG-PET compared to the other LPA groups. Instead, the LPA-DLBD patients had a predominantly parietal pattern of hypometabolism in the majority of cases suggesting that disruption of frontoparietal networks, reported to be associated with widespread cognitive and behavioral changes, are contributing to more behavioral changes endorsed in the LPA-DLBD patients29.

In the pathologic investigations, the LPA-DLBD patients had increased total cortical Lewy body counts as well as greater focal α-synuclein burden when compared to the DLB-DLBD. Greater involvement of inferior parietal lobe in LPA–DLBD patients compared to those with typical to DLB features might correlate with their language impairment41, which is usually relatively spared in typical DLB. The evidence suggests that differences in cortical distribution of α-synuclein pathology may be associated with different clinical phenotypes – LPA and DLB. This finding resembles that of tau in AD, where relatively higher tau and NFT burden in cortex compared to limbic structures is more frequently encountered in atypical non-amnestic AD compared to those with typical AD pathology 18. More severe frontal lobe pathology, including anterior cingulate gyrus, is associated with impaired negative emotion recognition and cognitive control42, which could be another reason for why the LPA-DLBD patients had higher FBI scores. Although we did not have FBI scores for the DLB-DLBD, frontal lobe behaviors are uncommon in early DLB, but may occur in more advanced stages of the disease43.

Paradoxically, almost 40% of non-FTLD LPA patients in this autopsy group had medial temporal TDP-43 pathology making it more prevalent than in earlier reports44, 45. What is intriguing is that the frequency of the TDP-43 pathology strikingly differed among the LPA pathologic subgroups: 67% of LPA-DLBD, 43% of LPA-ADTyp, yet in none of LPA-ADHpSp. We did not see a difference in TDP-43 frequency according to degree of cognitive impairment. In fact, we found the opposite trend. Five of 9(56%) of those with no or mild cognitive impairment on neuropsychological testing had TDP-43 compared to only 2/ 9(22%) in those with more than mild cognitive impairment. Hence, it appears that the frequency of TDP-43 in LPA is dependent on the frequencies of the underlying pathology and underlying AD subtype and not the degree of cognitive impairment and is consistent with our previous study46.

This brings up the issue of the LPA diagnosis and whether an LPA diagnosis should be limited to patients with pure aphasia, i.e. those without any non-language cognitive or behavioral impairment whatsoever. We have previously addressed this issue and could not find any meaningful differences between LPA cases with no, mild or more than mild cognitive impairment to support separating pure LPA from the rest27. Furthermore, the majority of studies on LPA have reported varying degrees of non-language cognitive impairment4, 47, 48. Other studies did not report neuropsychological results and, hence, it is not possible to know the degree of cognitive impairment3, 7, 49. In the present study, we did not find convincing evidence that any of our LPA patients were truly clinically different at presentation from the others.

Strengths of this study are the thorough neuropathologic examinations, the comprehensive clinical evaluations and the fact that approximately 90% of the patients in the study underwent FDG and PiB-PET imaging. Our findings should also generalize to LPA across the USA given the patients resided in different cities and states across the USA. Limitations are that our patients were not racially diverse and only two patients had flortaucipir PET. The overall sample size of our cohort is equal to, or greater than, other published LPA autopsy cohorts but the sample sizes when separated by pathologic diagnosis were small and is another limitation.

The findings add to the heterogeneity and complexity of the LPA phenotype. They also have important clinical significance as certain therapies such as choline esterase inhibitors can be beneficial for this group of LPA patients9, 40. Additionally, caution should be exercised when considering neuroleptic treatment for LPA patients who develop behavioral dyscontrol as severe adverse effects might occur in those with DLBD50. The presence of AD biomarkers should not presume AD as the only driver of the LPA phenotype as co-pathologies are common. Perhaps, a multi-biomarker approach is the current best step towards more accurate clinical classification of LPA and an important consideration for enrollment in surveillance studies and clinical trials.
