Introduction:

Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers have been recently proposed to represent brain amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Here, we evaluated plasma biomarkers’ contribution beyond the information provided by demographics (age and sex) to identifying Aβ and tau pathologies in individuals segregated as cognitively unimpaired (CU) and impaired (CI).

Methods:

We assessed 138 CU and 87 CI with available plasma p-tau231, 217+, and 181, Aβ42/40, GFAP and Aβ- and tau-PET.

Results:

In CU, only plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ significantly improved the performance of the demographics in detecting Aβ-PET positivity, while no plasma biomarker provided additional information to identify tau-PET positivity. In CI, p-tau217+ and GFAP significantly contributed to demographics to identify both Aβ-PET and tau-PET positivity, while p-tau231 only provided additional information to identify tau-PET positivity.

Discussion:

Our results support plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ as state markers of early Aβ deposition, but in later disease stages they inform on tau tangle accumulation.

pmc1. Introduction

Brain accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[1]. Quantification of brain deposits of Aβ and tau proteins in living people can increase the accuracy of a clinical diagnosis when assessing cognitively impaired (CI) individuals[2], and inform on the risk of progression to dementia in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals[3]. Reduction of Aβ42/40 and increased tau (both total [t-tau] and phosphorylated [p-tau] tau) levels are the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signatures of AD[4]. Similarly, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be used for the visual identification and quantification of Aβ[5] and tau[6] aggregates. More recently, plasma p-tau, Aβ, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) biomarkers have been associated with the presence of AD hallmark proteins in the living human brain[7–15].

Although early observations suggested that plasma levels of p-tau are highly associated with both tau and Aβ pathologies[7, 9, 10, 16], recent studies using individuals across the AD clinical spectrum with predominantly CU populations have suggested that these markers are state markers of Aβ deposition[10, 17]. This can be justified by the fact that p-tau may become hyperphosphorylated in response to initial Aβ dysmetabolism[10, 17–19]. In addition, plasma Aβ is associated with Aβ-PET accumulation[9, 20–23], while NfL, a unspecific marker of neurodegeneration, has also been associated with Aβ and tau in AD[14, 24–27]. Furthermore, plasma GFAP, a marker of astrocyte reactivity, has been associated with Aβ-PET[8, 12, 28] and tau-PET[15], which may be attributed to an increased expression of GFAP in regions surrounding proteinopathies [11, 29].

The clinical utility of these biomarkers ultimately depends on the information they can provide in real clinical settings, where clinical context and demographic information are available. In this regard, studies have shown that combining plasma biomarkers to demographic information (age, sex, APOE ε4) may lead to more accurate detection of AD than plasma biomarkers alone. Here, we aimed to elucidate the complementary contribution of each plasma biomarker on top of information already available in the demographics to inform on the state of brain deposition of Aβ and tau tangles, which is of potential clinical utility.

2. Methods

2.1 Study participants

We assessed 225 individuals [138 CU elderly adults, 53 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 34 AD dementia participants] from the Translational Biomarkers of Aging and Dementia (TRIAD) cohort of McGill University, Canada[30]. The participants underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). CU participants had a CDR score of 0 and as having no objective cognitive impairment. Participants with MCI had a CDR score of 0.5 preserved activities of daily living. AD dementia patients had a CDR score between 0.5 and 2 and met the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association criteria for probable Alzheimer’s disease determined. The individuals’ diagnoses were defined by a physician dementia specialist [31]. This study classified individuals diagnosed with AD or MCI in a cognitive impairment (CI) group. Details on the information gathered from participants can be found here: https://triad.tnl-mcgill.com/.

2.2 Neuroimaging

Participants included in this study had magnetic resonance imaging 3D T1-weighted MRI (3 T Siemens), tau [18F]MK6240 PET, and Aβ [18F]AZD4694 PET scans with a brain-dedicated Siemens High Resolution Research Tomograph at the Montreal Neurological Institute. The acquisition and processing of the images followed standard protocols (Supp. Method 1)[30]. Braak stages were calculated according to previously described methods[32]. We considered individuals as tau-PET positive if they presented abnormal tracer uptake in Braak I region or above as described elsewhere[32, 33]. Global [18F]AZD4694 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was estimated from a composite region combining precuneus, prefrontal, orbitofrontal, parietal, temporal, anterior, and posterior cingulate cortices[30]. We used the published [18F]AZD4694 cut-off value of 1.55 global SUVR to classify the participants as Aβ negative or positive[30].

2.3 Plasma measurements

Plasma p-tau181, p-tau231, and NfL concentrations were measured using in-house Single molecule array (Simoa) methods on an HD-X instrument (Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA) at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Mölndal, Sweden [7, 10, 34]. Plasma GFAP concentration was measured by Simoa using a commercial single-plex assay (No. 102336), while plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 concentrations were quantified using a commercially available multiplexed assay (Quanterix, Billerica, MA). Plasma p-tau217 concentration was quantified by Janssen R&amp;D using an assay specific for phosphorylation at amino acid 217, but with enhanced recognition when amino acid 212 is also phosphorylated (p-tau217+)[35].

2.4 Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software version 4.0.5 (http://www.r-project.org/). Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were calculated for CU and CI groups, and comparisons were performed using student t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. The association between the plasma biomarkers was assessed using Pearson correlations and linear regressions. Logistic regression models for Aβ- or tau-PET-positivity and linear regressions models with continuous Aβ- and tau-PET values were fitted containing demographic predictors alone (PET ~ sex + age) and with the addition of a plasma biomarker (PET ~ plasma biomarker + sex + age) and were compared using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; lower indicates better model fit). An interaction term between plasma biomarker × diagnosis/or MOCA was also added to the linear model. All logistic and linear models’ assumptions were checked to ensure the validity of the results. We assessed and compared the discriminative performances of each model using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and compared the area under the curve (AUC) with the DeLong test. Model goodness-of-fit was evaluated using R-square analyses. Partial correlation analyses were conducted to determine the extent to which biomarker concentrations were associated with Aβ and tau-PET using the ppcor package. Imaging analyses were carried out using the RMINC package. We controlled for multiple comparisons at α&lt;0.05 using false discovery rate (FDR) and the Bonferroni method for voxel-wise and ROI-based analyses, respectively.

3. Results

3.1 Participant characteristics and biomarker profile

In the CU group, 21.8% of individuals were Aβ-positive and, 24.3% were tau-positive. In the CI group, 80.4% were Aβ-PET positive and, 76.3% were tau-PET positive. The concentration of p-tau217+ was 2.4-fold higher in the CI compared to the CU group (P &lt; 0.0001). The concentrations of p-tau231 and GFAP were 1.5-fold higher in the CI compared to the CU group (P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, p-tau181 concentration was 1.7-fold higher (P &lt; 0.001) and NfL concentration was 1.2-fold higher in the CI group (P = 0.010). Plasma Aβ42/40 ratio was not significantly different between the diagnostic groups. Demographic and biomarker characteristics of the population are summarized in Table 1 and Supp. Table1.

3.2 Correlations between plasma biomarkers

The distribution and Pearson correlation coefficients between plasma biomarkers are shown in Supp. Fig 1–2. In the CU group, correlations between plasma p-tau231, p-tau217+, and p-tau181 measures (P &lt; 0.001), as well as for GFAP with p-tau181 (P = 0.005) and NfL (P = 0.002) were statistically significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Plasma Aβ42/40 was not significantly associated with any other plasma marker. In the CI group, plasma p-tau biomarkers were significantly associated with GFAP (P &lt; 0.001), while Aβ42/40 and NfL were not significantly associated with each other or the other plasma biomarkers.

3.3 Prediction of Aβ-PET positivity using plasma biomarkers

In the CU group, a plasma p-tau231 model (AUC = 0.877, 95% confidence interval: 0.784–0.940), followed by p-tau217+ (AUC = 0.852, 95% confidence interval: 0.772–0.921), presented significant contributions to the demographics-only (sex and age) model to predict Aβ-PET positivity (Table 2, Supp Table 2–3). In contrast, the addition of plasma p-tau181, Aβ42/40, GFAP, and NfL to the demographics did not significantly improve the models. In the CI group, the addition of GFAP (AUC = 0.838, 95% confidence interval: 0.731–0.925), followed by p-tau217+ (AUC = 0.796, 95% confidence interval: 0.685–0.912), significantly contributed to the models with demographics-only to detect Aβ deposition (Table 2). On the other hand, adding plasma p-tau231, p-tau181, Aβ42/40, and NfL did not significantly contribute to the demographics-only model to predict Aβ-PET positivity. Adding APOE ε4 as a demographic predictor did not change the results (Table 2).

3.4 Prediction of tau-PET positivity with plasma biomarkers

In the CU group, no plasma biomarker significantly added to the demographic-only model to predict tau-PET positivity (Table 2, Supp Table 2–3). In the CI group, the addition of p-tau217+ (AUC = 0.926, 95% confidence interval: 0.865–0.988), p-tau231 (AUC = 0.802, 95% confidence interval: 0.689–0.915), and GFAP (AUC = 0.871, 95% confidence interval: 0.795–0.940) significantly contributed to the demographics-only models to detect tau-PET abnormalities (Table 2). On the other hand, adding plasma p-tau181, Aβ42/40 and NfL did not significantly contribute the demographics-only model to predict tau-PET positivity. Adding APOE ε4 as a demographic predictor did not change the results (Table 2).

3.5 Association of Aβ-PET SUVR with plasma biomarkers

In the CU group, we found a significant positive association between p-tau231, p-tau217+, and GFAP concentrations with global Aβ-PET SUVR values (Supp. Table 4). No significant association was found between global Aβ-PET SUVR values and Aβ42/40, p-tau181, or NfL. Plasma p-tau217+ explained the highest variance of global Aβ-PET SUVR values (R-squared: 0.37), closely followed by p-tau231 (R-squared: 0.33). In the CI group, p-tau231, p-tau217+, p-tau181, and GFAP concentrations were significantly positively associated with global Aβ-PET SUVR. No significant association was found between global Aβ-PET SUVR and Aβ42/40 and NfL. Plasma p-tau217+ explained the highest variance of global Aβ-PET SUVR values (R-squared: 0.25), closely followed by GFAP (R-squared: 0.24) (Supp. Table 4).

3.6 Association of tau-PET SUVR with plasma biomarkers

In the CU group, we found a significant positive association between p-tau231, p-tau217+, and GFAP concentrations with entorhinal tau-PET SUVR values (Supp. Table 4). No significant association was found between entorhinal tau-PET SUVR values and Aβ42/40, p-tau181, or NfL. Plasma p-tau231 concentration best explained variance in the entorhinal tau-PET SUVR values (R-squared: 0.17). In the CI group, p-tau231, p-tau217+, p-tau181and GFAP concentrations were significantly positively associated with entorhinal tau-PET SUVR values. No significant association was found between entorhinal tau-PET SUVR values and Aβ42/40 values. Plasma p-tau217+ explained the highest variance in the entorhinal tau-PET SUVR (R-squared: 0.19), closely followed by p-tau231 (R-squared: 0.18) and GFAP (R-squared: 0.18) (Supp. Table 4).

Finally, comparison of the correlation coefficient for plasma p-tau biomarkers demonstrated that, in CU individuals, p-tau231 and p-tau217 were more closely associated with Aβ-PET (p-tau217+, ρ = 0.550; p-tau231, ρ = 0. 517) than with tau-PET [(p-tau217+, ρ = 0.231; p-tau231, ρ = 0. 216), P &lt; 0.001, Supp. Table 5)]. On the other hand, in the CI group, we found that plasma p-tau217 was more closely associated with tau-PET + (ρ = 0.713) than with Aβ-PET (ρ = 0. 472, P = 0.01, Supp. Table 5), whereas no differences were detected for plasma p-tau231(P = 0.936, Supp. Table 5).

3.7 Voxel-wise associations of Aβ-PET SUVR with plasma biomarkers

Voxel-wise linear regression analysis confirmed previous studies showing that plasma biomarkers are associated with Aβ-PET. In the CU group, we showed a significant positive association between Aβ-PET SUVR and plasma p-tau (p-tau231 &gt; p-tau217+ &gt; p-tau181) (Fig. 1A) and GFAP (Supp. Fig. 3) in AD-related regions. No significant associations were found between Aβ-PET and plasma Aβ42/40 ratio or NfL concentration. In the CI group, we observed a significant positive association between Aβ-PET SUVR with plasma p-tau (Fig. 1C) and GFAP concentrations after correction for multiple comparisons. Plasma NfL showed small clusters with significant negative association with Aβ-PET SUVR after multiple comparison corrections. Investigating the entire population, we did not observe a significant interaction between diagnosis and plasma biomarkers on Aβ-PET. We observe a significant interaction between MoCA score and p-tau217+ on Aβ-PET.

Then, we evaluated the brain regions to which the addition of each plasma biomarker significantly improved the demographics-only model to predict Aβ-PET regional SUVR. In the CU group, plasma p-tau231 significantly contributed to predict Aβ signal in the lateral and medial temporal, posterior cingulate and precuneus, and medial frontal lobe, i.e., in areas typically associated with AD (Fig. 2A). P-tau217+ showed a significant contribution in similar regions but the associations were weaker than those observed for p-tau231. Plasma p-tau181, GFAP, Aβ42/40, and NfL did not improve the demographics-only model. In the CI group, GFAP and p-tau217+ increased the predictive performance of demographics-only in AD-related regions (Fig. 2C and Supp. Fig. 4). Although plasma p-tau231 and p-tau181 concentrations were correlated with Aβ-PET, they did not contribute to the demographics-only model to predict Aβ-PET signal (Fig. 2C). Plasma Aβ42/40 and NfL also did not contribute to the demographics-only model.

3.8 Voxel-wise association of tau-PET SUVR with plasma biomarkers

Voxel-wise linear regression confirmed previous studies showing that plasma biomarkers are directly associated with tau-PET (Fig. 1). In the CU group, we observed a significant positive association between tau-PET SUVR and p-tau231 and p-tau217+ in small clusters in the precuneus and temporal lobe (Fig. 1B). No significant association was found between tau-PET and plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, or GFAP or NfL concentrations. In the CI group, we observed significant positive associations between tau-PET SUVR and plasma p-tau231, p-tau217+, and GFAP concentrations across the brain cortex (Fig. 1D and Supp. Fig. 3). Plasma p-tau181 showed a significant positive association in the precuneus and temporal cortices. No significant association was found between tau-PET signal and plasma Aβ42/40 ratio or NfL concentration. Investigating the entire population, we observed a significant interaction between diagnosis and plasma p-tau217+, p-tau231, and GFAP on tau-PET (Supp. Fig. 5A). We also observe a significant interaction between MoCA score and plasma p-tau181, p-tau217+, p-tau231 and GFAP on tau-PET (Supp. Fig. 5B).

Next, we examined the brain regions that each plasma biomarker significantly improve prediction of tau-PET SUVR compared with the demographics-only model. In the CU group, plasma p-tau, GFAP, Aβ42/40, and NfL did not significantly contribute to the demographics-only model (Fig. 2B and Supp. Fig. 4). In the CI group, p-tau217+ showed a significant contribution to the demographics-only model through the whole cortex comprising regions of early and late Braak stages (Fig. 2D). Plasma p-tau231 showed a significant contribution in similar regions. Plasma GFAP increased the predictive performance of the demographics-only model in AD-related regions (Supp. Fig. 4). Aβ42/40 and NfL did not contribute to the demographics-only model to predict tau-PET regional concentrations.

We then assessed the brain regions where the plasma biomarker contribution to the demographic-only model overlapped to detect Aβ and tau-PET signals. In CU, plasma biomarkers were only regionally associated with Aβ-PET (Fig. 3A–B and Supp. Fig. 6). In CI, plasma p-tau231 provided additional information on tau tangle accumulation in AD-related regions (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, plasma p-tau217+ correlated only with Aβ-PET in 3% of the brain regions, with tau-PET only in 35%, and overlap both in 39% of the brain regions (Fig. 3D), further supporting that this marker reflects both pathologies. Similarly, for plasma GFAP, 23% of brain regions were only associated with Aβ-PET, 13% only with tau-PET, and overlap both in 31% of the brain regions (Supp. Fig. 6).

4. Discussion

Our results support previous literature suggesting that, in preclinical AD, plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ are closely related to brain Aβ deposition. Our main finding was that in the CI population, plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ also inform on tau tangle deposition.

We demonstrated that in CI individuals, plasma p-tau231 may provide information regarding the presence of tau tangles, while p-tau217+ informs on both tau tangle and Aβ deposition, which would be relevant to the clinical setting when patients with symptoms are evaluated. Notably, our findings also support previous studies showing that p-tau231 and p-tau217 are highly associated with Aβ pathology in CU individuals,[17] which thus would be relevant for screening applications. In addition, our results add to the understanding that p-tau231 and p-tau217 become more closely related to tau tangles in later disease stages, when Aβ levels have reached a plateau. These results align with postmortem observations showing that plasma p-tau231 levels were elevated as a function of Braak stages[36], a finding also observed in vivo[37]. Furthermore, our results corroborate with recent findings showing that p-tau217 is associated with both Aβ and tau tangle aggregation in symptomatic individuals[19, 38, 39]. Taken together, these results support a model suggesting that tau phosphorylation may result from early Aβ aggregation in CU individuals, which mobilizes tau for aggregation, explaining the strong correlation of plasma p-tau with tau-PET signal in CI individuals, when Aβ plaques have reached a plateau and tau tangles continue to develop. This highlights that the associations of plasma p-tau with brain deposits of Aβ and tau tangles are dynamic and may change with the progression of the disease and the amount of each pathology.

Our results demonstrated that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau-217+ provide additional data to the information already available in demographics to identify brain Aβ pathology and tau tangles. This is important to determine the potential clinical usefulness of these markers since age and sex are always available, whereas APOE genotyping is simple, non-expensive, and often available in memory clinic settings. Our results align with a growing body of evidence suggesting that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 highly correlate with AD pathologies, and outperform p-tau181, Aβ, and NfL[17, 39]. The results also indicate that these markers have the additional advantage of providing complementary information to the demographics to identify AD[17]. Corroborating previous literature, we showed that plasma p-tau181 and p-tau231 were directly correlated with Aβ-PET in CI [7, 10]; however, the data provided by p-tau181 overlapped with the information already available by the demographics. Altogether, these results support that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 are robust markers of AD pathophysiology that can potentially add information to evaluating patients in clinical settings.

Plasma GFAP showed a strong correlation with AD pathophysiology comparable to plasma p-tau217+ and p-tau231. These results align with previous studies showing that GFAP is highly correlated with Aβ-PET and tau-PET [8, 15, 40], and suggest that this biomarker has the potential to be used in the classification of AD patients. Additionally, our findings showing that plasma GFAP is associated with tau-PET in Braak I-II regions in asymptomatic individuals align with recent findings from our group [15]. The good performance of GFAP in predicting Aβ-PET and tau-PET may be due to several reasons, such as the fact that the presence of astrocyte reactivity, as measured by GFAP, may facilitate the development of Aβ or tau pathology, or that GFAP concentration increases in response to proteinopathies[41]. Further studies are needed to understand the underpinning of this association. Together, our results support that plasma GFAP has the potential to be clinically relevant to the assessment of brain AD pathophysiology.

Plasma Aβ42/40 provided information that overlapped with demographic data to identify Aβ-PET deposition. Specifically, we demonstrated that adding Aβ42/40 did not increase the predictive performance of the demographics-only model to identify Aβ- or tau-PET. These results add to the conflicting literature where some studies suggest that plasma Aβ42/40 strongly associates with brain Aβ-PET deposition[20, 21], whilst others report only a moderate association between blood and brain Aβ levels[42, 43] [44]. Multiple biological and analytical factors may contribute to the divergence of the results. For example, peripheral Aβ expression account for &gt; 50% of the global plasma Aβ[45]. In addition, the modest fold-change between CU and CI in plasma (10–20%) compared with CSF Aβ (40–60%) may lead to the high susceptibility of plasma Aβ measures to small variabilities in pre-analytical approaches and cohort characteristics [20, 23, 43]. Notably, differences in the analytical performance of different Aβ assays used across studies may explain some of the variation in the results[22, 46]. However, most data suggest that plasma Aβ42/40 ratio as such is not a very robust biomarker for biological reasons, and that improved methods might only partially solve the problem.

The main strength of the study is the use of a well-characterized cohort of individuals that underwent state-of-the-art harmonized biomarker acquisitions and quantifications, including most of the currently available promising AD biomarkers. However, limitations should be considered. The cohort is composed of individuals motivated to participate in a dementia study, potentially being a source of self-selection bias. It would be highly desirable to replicate these results in a clinical setting. Moreover, this study includes mostly White individuals, which limits the generalizability of our results to other populations such as Black and LatinX individuals.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, our results support that in preclinical AD plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ are state markers of Aβ, whereas in CI they additionally inform on brain deposition of tau neurofibrillary tangles.

Figure 1. Regional associations between Aβ-PET and tau-PET with plasma biomarker concentrations in CU and CI individuals.

Panels A and D show the regions with a significant positive association between Aβ-PET SUVR and plasma markers in CU and CI individuals. In the CI group, a significant negative association with plasma NfL and Aβ-PET SUVR were found in small clusters after multiple comparison corrections. No significant associations were found between plasma Aβ42/40 and Aβ-PET SUVR. Panels B and D show the regions indicating a significant positive association between tau-PET SUVR and plasma markers. No significant associations were found between plasma Aβ42/40 and NfL and tau-PET SUVR after multiple comparison corrections. Associations for plasma GFAP are shown in Supplementary Figure 3. CU = Cognitively unimpaired, CI = Cognitively impaired.

Figure 2. Brain regions that each plasma biomarker contributes to the model with demographics-only to predict Aβ-PET and tau-PET concentrations.

The figure shows voxel-wise AIC maps of regressions between Aβ- and tau-PET and plasma markers [PET ~ sex + age + (plasma biomarker)] after FDR correction at P &lt; 0.05. Figure A and C show the regions where the addition of plasma biomarkers contributes significantly to the demographics-only model to depict Aβ-PET concentrations in CU and CI individuals. Figure B shows that the addition of plasma biomarkers in CU did not contribute to the demographic-only model to depict tau-PET concentration. Figure D shows the regions where adding plasma biomarkers to the demographics-only model contributes to depicting tau-PET concentrations in CI. The ΔAIC higher than 10 represents the significant additive effect of the plasma biomarker on the model in comparison with the model with only demographics. Regional associations for plasma GFAP are shown in Supplementary Figure 3. CU = Cognitively unimpaired, CI = Cognitively impaired. Aβ42/40 and NfL did not show a significant additive effect on the model. Demographics = age and sex.

Figure 3. Topographic overlap between brain regions shows that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ provided additional information to demographics to predict Aβ-PET and tau-PET concentrations.

Figure A and B represent the percentage of significant voxels that plasma p-tau231 significantly contribute to the demographics-only model and the overlap regions between Aβ and tau-PET. Figure C and D represents the percentage of significant voxels that plasma p-tau217+ significantly added to the demographics-only model and the overlap regions between Aβ and tau-PET. The pizza plot represents the number of significant voxels that overlap out of the total number of voxels in the cortical mask. Biomarkers not shown in the figure did not present significant results. Demographics = age and sex.

DeLong test provided significant differences between the model with demographics-only and models with the addition of each biomarker.

* P &lt; 0.05. CU = cognitively unimpaired, CI = cognitively impaired. Results including only the subset of individuals that has measures of all biomarkers demonstrated that the results remained the same (Supp. Table 2). Comparison of the performance between plasma biomarkers are described in Supp. Table 3. To all models age and sex were included as covariate.

Highlights

It is still unclear how much plasma biomarkers contribute to identifying AD pathology across the AD spectrum beyond the information already provided by demographics (age + sex).

Plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217+ contribute to demographic information to identify brain Aβ deposition status in preclinical AD.

In CI individuals, plasma p-tau231 contributes to demographics to inform on the accumulation of tau tangles, while p-tau217+ and GFAP inform on both Aβ deposition and tau pathology.

Consent Statement

All participants provided written informed consent, and the study received approval from both the Montreal Neurological Institute PET working committee and the Douglas Mental Health University Institute Research Ethics Board.
