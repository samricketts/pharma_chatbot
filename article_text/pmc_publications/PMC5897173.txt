Introduction

There is a pressing need to develop effective treatments to address the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. AD affected 5.4 million Americans in 2016 and will inflict about 15 million by 20501. While AD cannot yet be prevented, slowed, or cured, aerobic exercise stands out as a potentially effective treatment in slowing cognitive decline. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) show that aerobic exercise can improve cognition among adults with intact cognition as well as those with cognitive impairment2–5. Executive function was further found to be the most responsive cognitive domain to aerobic exercise3. Nonetheless, executive function has rarely been measured as an outcome and little is known about how aerobic exercise affects executive function in older adults with AD6,7.

Executive function refers to the cognitive ability to plan, organize, coordinate, and sequence complex, goal-directed behaviors such as instrumental activities of daily living8. Such cognitive skills rely on the integrity of the frontal lobes and subcortical circuitry of the brain9,10. Due to the heterogeneity in the way executive function has historically been conceptualized and measured, there is conflicting evidence regarding the natural course and precise trajectory of these cognitive skills in aging generally and specifically in the context of AD. Many studies suggest that executive function is particularly vulnerable to the aging process, although age-related decline may not necessarily be uniform across all cognitive skills in this domain11. As research in normal aging and dementia is refined, different models and theories of executive function continue to be proposed. Some theorists believe executive function is a parallel cognitive domain similar to the domains of memory, visuospatial, and language, which is supported by findings that persons with AD who experience predominant executive dysfunction, compared to those with AD who experience predominant memory impairment, show more difficulties in solving problems and possibly more rapid disease progression12. In contrast, others suggest that executive function is not confined to a single domain but rather play an important supportive role in the functioning of many other cognitive abilities, including memory13.

In AD research and clinical practice, executive function has been widely used as a discrete cognitive domain. However, it was not included in the early versions of global cognitive instruments such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the AD Assessment Scale – Cognition (ADAS-cog). The past two decades witnessed an increasing recognition of the importance of executive function. Studies show that executive dysfunction could occur earlier than impairment in other cognitive domains to signal the onset of AD. For example, about 32%–42% of older adults with normal scores on the MMSE show executive dysfunction14. Executive dysfunction contributes independently to the reduced ability to perform activities of daily living and increased care needs of older adults14.

The prevalence of executive dysfunction increases tremendously among older adults diagnosed with AD, ranging from 64% to 87.5%7,15. Imaging studies further confirm that executive dysfunction is evident due to reduced function in the frontal lobes in individuals with even mild AD16. In AD, executive dysfunction is typically characterized by impairment in planning, inhibition, and generation17,18. Inhibition, the ability to control interference to maintain goal-directed behaviors, shows a complete breakdown in older adults with AD19. Furthermore, executive dysfunction leads to more functional impairment among those with AD15,17.

Given the prevalence of AD and executive dysfunction, there is a pressing need to develop interventions capable of maintaining or slowing the decline of executive function. Interestingly, the increasing numbers of RCTs have allowed for several meta-analyses demonstrating that aerobic exercise produces modest-to-moderate cognitive gains with the most striking improvement in executive function among healthy individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment2–4,20. Aerobic exercise modifies the frontal lobe structure and function through biologically-sound pathways which contribute to improved executive function, e.g., upregulation of neurogenesis, synpatogensis, and brain-derived neurotrophic factors and down-regulation of oxidative stress and AD-associated pathologic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles21.

In AD research, three measures of executive function are commonly included in a standard neuropsychological battery: the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part B22, the Golden Stroop test23, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)24. Other instruments have also been used but are not part of the standard battery in AD research. Some are more clinically useful and/or capture aspects of executive function that are not measured by the TMT, COWAT, and Stroop, including the Executive Interview – 25 (EXIT-25)25 and Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS)26. Currently, many measures of executive function are solely administered under the supervision of a licensed neuropsychologist who is employed at a specialty clinic, which substantially limits the detection of early executive dysfunction when the brain is still sufficiently neuroplastic and interventions are most likely effective. Nurses are in a unique position to help screen for executive dysfunction because of their direct and frequent contact with patients, especially in the primary care setting.

The purpose of this study was to test the ability of different measures for identifying changes in executive function and the effect of 6-months of aerobic exercise on executive function in community-dwelling older adults with mild to moderate AD. The research questions are: What is the ability of different measures for identifying change in executive function for clinical and research purposes in older adults with mild to moderate AD?

How do 6-months of aerobic exercise affect executive function?

How does the 6-month change in executive function compare to that of global cognition?

Materials and Methods

Design

This study used a single-group, repeated-measures design to test the ability of different measures for identifying changes in executive function and the effect of 6-months of aerobic exercise on executive function in community-dwelling older adults with mild to moderate AD. Executive function and global cognition were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months by a trained research assistant (RA) who was blinded to the study aims. The study was approved by the university’s Institutional Review Board.

Sample

Eligibility criteria

Participants were recruited using a variety of resources such as newspaper advertisement, educational seminars, and provider referral. Potential participants were screened over the phone to assess AD diagnosis and health history, in-person interview to obtain informed consent and eligibility assessment, and medical clearance to confirm AD diagnosis and exercise safety from the health providers27.

The inclusion criteria were: a) English-speaking; b) community-dwelling; c) resting heart rate &lt; 100 beats per minute; d) MMSE score 12–24. We selected the score range of 12 to 24 because we have found in our previous study that participants with an MMSE score &lt; 12 were too impaired to be able to complete the cognitive instruments; e) Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score 1–3; f) 60 years of age and older; g) verified AD diagnosis by the primary care provider; and h) medical clearance for aerobic exercise by the primary care provider and, if significant cardiac history and have a cardiologist, by the cardiologist. The exclusion criteria were: a) unstable medical conditions in the previous six months (e.g., hip fracture, ongoing and unplanned weight loss, severe shortness of breath, deep vein thrombosis, hernia, unhealed sores, joint swelling, pain, or trouble walking); b) new symptoms not yet examined by the provider; c) presence of significant neurological and psychiatric disorders or alcohol or chemical dependency in the past five years; and d) a score of 5 or more on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale.

Setting

The study took place in a major metropolitan area in the Midwest of the USA. All study sites were close to hospitals with an on-site emergency response system. The exercise intervention was delivered at a YMCA gymnasium or an assisted living facility, whichever was closer to a participant’s residence. Undergraduate RAs provided transportation for the participants to attend all study-related activities using the university’s rental vehicles. A clean driving history and valid driver’s license were hiring requirements for the transportation RAs. They were trained about route planning, pickup and drop-off of the participants, and interaction with the participants during transit by the principal investigator and interventionist. The university fleet service carried liability insurance that provided liability coverage. In case of emergency, the RAs were instructed to contact the Fleet service, the study interventionist, and the principal investigator in the descending order. They were to call 911 if it was a life-threatening situation.

Data collection occurred in the university’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). An undergraduate RA was trained to collect data by the study neuropsychologist and the principal investigator. Training included explanation, demonstration, role play, practice with families/friends, and practice with the investigators. The neuropsychologist approved the RA to start data collection when he considered the RA fully trained. The RA administered all the instruments while blinded to the study aims at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Each data collection took approximately 45 minutes. All subjects were able to complete data collection, and we did not observe any substantial response burden. The collected data were reviewed by the principal investigator for accuracy and completeness. Any discrepancies were resolved through a discussion among the neuropsychologist, RA, and principal investigator. The neuropsychologist further randomly checked 10% of the collected data to ensure quality. Ongoing training to all RAs was provided as appropriate after each data collection period, when issues arose, and semi-annually.

Cycling Intervention

The aerobic exercise intervention was a 6-month, individualized, and supervised moderate-intensity cycling program completed three times a week on recumbent stationary cycles. Two brands of the cycles were used: Precor™ (Woodinville, WA) and LIVESTRONG® R1x (Taiwan) recumbent cycles. Attempts were made to have each participant use the same cycle whenever possible. However, the use of two brands of cycles and different cycles did not affect exercise prescription or delivery in any way because the cycling intensity was individualized based on each participant’s heart rate (HR) reserve and rating of perceived exertion scale, instead of any settings or readings from the cycles. Moderate intensity was chosen because this intensity is recommended for older adults to obtain optimal health benefits while minimizing exercise-related risks and adverse-events28. In this study, moderate intensity was defined as 65%–75% of HR reserve or rating of perceived exertion scale of 12–13. The duration of cycling at moderate intensity started at 15 minutes per session and was progressively increased by 5-minute increments over time to 45 minutes. With 5-minutes for warm-up and cool-down, each session lasted from 25 minutes initially to 55 minutes over time. In each session, a trained exercise therapist supervised 1–3 participants and checked HR and rating of perceived exertion, blood pressure, signs and symptoms of overexertion (e.g., severe shortness of breath), and participant’s ability to talk during exercise every 5 minutes and as needed to ensure exercise safety. The principal investigator randomly checked 10% of all data collection and exercise sessions to ensure data collection and treatment fidelity and re-trained the RA and exercise therapist as needed.

Variables and Measures

The study variables included executive function, global cognition, and demographics. Since executive function encompasses multiple cognitive skills, it was measured using 5 instruments including the EXIT-25, BDS, COWAT, TMT, and Stroop. Few studies have examined the change in executive function resulted from aerobic exercise interventions in older adults with AD, and studies in other populations have used a variety of instruments. We chose our instruments based upon two rationales: 1) Instruments which are commonly included in the standard neuropsychological battery in AD research, such as the TMT, COWAT, and Stroop; and 2) Instruments that are not part of the standard battery in AD research but have been shown to have clinical utility and capture aspects of executive function that may not be measured by the TMT, COWAT, and Stroop.

The EXIT-25 assesses different aspects of executive function such as cognitive flexibility, processing speed, and sequencing, and has 25 items. Each item is scored from 0 to 2 with a total score range of 0–50. A higher score indicates worse executive function. The inter-rater reliability of the EXIT-25 is 0.9025.

The TMT measures the cognitive domains of processing speed, sequencing, cognitive flexibility, and visual-motor skills and includes two separate timed tasks. Part A is a page with circled numbers from 1 to 25 and asks the participant to draw a line from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and so on in order until the end is reached. Part B has both circled numbers and letters. A participant begins at number one and draws a line from 1 to A, A to 2, 2 to B, B to 3, 3 to C, and so on in order until she reaches the end. The time it takes in seconds to complete Part B is recorded as the final score. Part A is presumed to test visual-motor skills while part B tests higher level cognitive skills such as mental flexibility. The task for either part is terminated after 5 minutes (300 seconds) if not completed. The inter-rater reliability of the TMT is 0.9022.

The Golden Stroop Test is associated with cognitive flexibility, attention, and resistance to interference from outside stimuli, and has color and color-word tasks. The color task asks the participant to read words aloud as quickly and as accurately as she can in 120 seconds. The color-word task requires the participant to name aloud the color of the ink in which each word is printed (red, blue, green, or tan) as quickly and as accurately as she can in 120 seconds. The score is the number of words reported correctly on the color-word trial. The inter-rater reliability of the Stroop ranges from 0.71–0.8823.

The COWAT assesses working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition by asking participants to generate as many words as possible within one minute that start with each of three letters including F, A, and S. The test-retest reliability of the COWAT ranges from 0.47 to 0.7024.

The BDS assesses motor and cognitive regulation by asking participants to perform eight different tasks such as tapping twice with the dominant hand and once with the non-dominant hand, alternating thumb-finger, and fist-edge-palm. A ninth item is an insight rating question about the participant’s awareness regarding the accuracy of his/her performance. Each scale is scored from 0 to 3 with a total score of 0–27. Higher scores indicate better performance. The intra-class correlation coefficients range from 0.84–0.9826.

Global cognition was assessed using the ADAS-cog which is the most widely used measure in AD pharmacological RCTs. The ADAS-cog assesses orientation, memory registration and recall, language, and praxis with a total score of 0–70 (higher score = worse function). The inter-rater reliability of the ADAS-cog is 0.65–0.99 and test-retest reliability is 0.51–1.029.

The order of administration for the cognitive instruments was the EXIT-25 or BDS, ADAS-cog, TMT, COWAT, Stroop, and EXIT-25 or BDS. A random method was used to determine if the EXIT-25 or BDS was administered first by flipping a coin. The rationales for ordering the measures this way were to: 1) reduce practice effects by separating instruments with similar tasks; and 2) increase administration efficiency by reducing wait time.

Demographic variables in the study included age, gender, and education which were obtained at baseline. Age and education were assessed as continuous variables (number of years) while gender was dichotomized as male and female.

Statistical analysis

Demographic variables were summarized as mean ± standard deviation or frequency (%) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. To identify the measures that are able to capture the variability and changes in executive function, factor analysis was used to construct a single (latent) measure of executive function and we assessed the correlation between the various measures and the executive function factor. The rationale for performing the factor analysis was to illustrate and inform future research about data analysis. Multiple measures of executive function were needed to capture the diverse components of this cognitive domain. However, analyzing each of the instruments separately has significant implications for interpretability, power, and sample size. A combined factor (which averages over the measurement error of each instrument) gives a less variable measure of executive function which, in turn, increases the power to detect differences across time. Additionally, interpreting the results from multiple instruments can be challenging especially when results are divergent across different measures. In a prospective study, if a latent factor for executive function could be established, we reduce the possibility that the sample size has to be substantially increased in order to perform adjustment for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni adjustment).

Based upon the findings from the first question, the analyses focused on the executive function factor score and the instruments that correlated most strongly with executive function in this population in order to examine the effects of 6 months of aerobic exercise on executive function. The longitudinal measures of executive function were analyzed using a mixed-effects linear model with month of measurement (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) as a categorical fixed effect and a random intercept for each participant to account for the correlation among measurements from the same participant. We compared the (model-based) average change in executive function between baseline and month 3 as well as between baseline and month 6. The effect size for the change in executive function was defined as the model-based estimated average of change in the raw score divided by the model-based estimate of the standard deviation of the between-subject variability at each time point. The effect size was scaled so that positive effect sizes indicate improvements in cognitive ability. Because mixed models natively handle missing data, missing response data were not imputed. Measures of executive function considered in this analysis included the BDS, COWAT, EXIT-25, Stroop, TMT, and an executive function factor score using the Bartlett’s method based upon the factor analysis described above.

A similar modeling approach was used to examine the effect of the intervention on global cognition. Specifically, a longitudinal model was fit for ADAS-cog with the same fixed and random-effects as the longitudinal models for the measures of executive function. The effect size for the change in global cognition was compared to the effect size for the change in executive function as measured by the executive function factor score.

All data analyses were performed using R Version 3.1.1 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). Differences were considered significant at adjusted p&lt;0.05.

Results

The average age of the study sample was 78.1 ± 8.37 with 16.1 ± 2.98 years of education. Seventeen (61%) participants were women. All participants were Caucasian. Of the 28 participants enrolled in the study, 26 (93%) and 22 (79%) completed the cognitive assessments at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Reasons for dropouts were all study-unrelated, such as relocation and wrist fracture. Of the prescribed 72 total exercise sessions, the participants attended a mean 84.7% of the sessions and achieved the session cycling prescription on 89.4% of the sessions. Among the 22 participants who completed the 6-month data collection, they attended a mean 97.2% of the sessions and met session prescription on 86.4% of the sessions27.

1) What is the ability of different measures for identifying change in executive function for clinical and research purposes in older adults with mild to moderate AD?

The EXIT-25, BDS, and Stroop were able to identify changes in executive function over time in our study population, but the COWAT and TMT were not able to identify changes. Sixty out of the 76 times (92%) when the TMT was administered, the task was terminated at 5 minutes. The TMT was 280.29 seconds at baseline and 281.56 at 6 months.

A single latent factor was sufficient to describe the variability in the five measures of executive function (the BDS, COWAT, EXIT-25, Stroop, and TMT). The TMT and COWAT instruments are more weakly correlated with the latent factor of executive function compared to the other measures (Table A.1). In contrast, the EXIT-25, BDS, and Stroop instruments are all highly correlated with the latent factor of executive function and may be the preferred measures to capture the heterogeneous elements of executive function among individuals with mild to moderate AD.

2) How do 6 months of aerobic exercise affect executive function?

Estimates of the change in executive function from baseline to 3 and 6 months (as assessed by each instrument and the factor score), effect size, and significance tests are provided in Table A.2a. Executive function as measured by the EXIT-25 and BDS improved from baseline to 3 months (ES = 0.04 and 0.08, respectively) while executive function as measured by the Stroop and the factor score showed a modest and minimal decline, respectively, at 3 months (ES = −0.24 and −0.03, respectively). However, none of the changes between baseline and 3 months on these measures were statistically significant (p-values ranged from 0.15–0.82). Improvements in executive function as measured by the EXIT-25 and BDS tests were reversed by 6 months, resulting in a net, non-statistically significant decline in executive function from baseline to 6 months for all measures (ES = −0.11, −0.24, −0.27, and −0.21 for the BDS, EXIT-25, Stroop, and factor score).

3) How does the 6-month change in executive function compare to that in global cognition?

Change from baseline and associated effect sizes for the ADAS-cog at each time point are provided in Table A.2b. Executive function as measured using the composite factor score declined to a minimal degree from baseline to 3 months (ES = −0.03, p = 0.76) while global cognition improved slightly, but non-significantly, over this same period (ES = 0.14, p = 0.47). Between baseline and 6 months, executive function declined (ES = −0.21, p = 0.06), comparable to the decline in global cognition (ES = −0.20, p = 0.34) over the same period.

Discussion

Our findings show that individually the EXIT-25, BDS, and Stroop were the preferred instruments for measuring executive function in community-dwelling older adults with mild to moderate AD. The COWAT and TMT had substantial floor effects limiting their ability to identify changes in executive function in this population. These findings address a significant research and practice gap in the assessment and measurement of executive function in AD as the construct often goes unmeasured or is assessed in a limited fashion due to the multidimensional manner in which executive function has been conceptualized7,8. Theoretical advancement and instrument development suggests that executive dysfunction is often an early sign of dementia, is prevalent in AD17,18, and is a significant contributor to decline in activities of daily living and care needs14,15. Although several instruments have been developed for assessing executive function, our findings show that commonly used tests such as the COWAT and TMT have limited ability to identify changes in executive function in older adults with mild to moderate AD when used alone. Notable is the fact that approximately 79% of the participants in our study could not complete the TMT-B within 5 minutes. Ninety-two percent of the times when the TMT was administered, the task was terminated at 5 minutes due to participants’ inability to follow the instructions and/or have high error ratios, indicating that the TMT is not sensitive enough to capture a sufficient range in executive function among individuals with mild to moderate AD due to the measure’s susceptibility towards a floor effect.

To date, few studies have evaluated the effect of an aerobic exercise intervention specifically on executive function in older adults with mild to moderate AD. Among individuals without dementia, aerobic exercise has been shown to produce mild to moderate cognitive improvements across all cognitive domains, with the most striking improvement occurring in executive function2,3. Biomarker and basic science studies further suggest that aerobic exercise improves cognition through biological pathways by improving the integrity of brain structure and function30–32. Nonetheless, experimental studies testing the effects of aerobic exercise on cognition in AD samples have been confounded by significant methodological limitations. Many lacked a well-characterized AD sample, have used low dose exercise programs that do not meet the recommended activity standards for frequency, intensity, or duration for older adults (e.g., the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that older adults engage in 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise each week), and have been unsuccessful in delivering the planned dose of aerobic exercise5,6,33. In contrast, our study included the use of a well-quantified dose of aerobic exercise and found that executive function remained relatively unchanged on all measures. Our finding is consistent with those from other types of exercise studies. For example, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that Tai Chi has a small but positive effect on executive function in older adults with cognitive impairment34. These findings together support that exercise could potentially play a beneficial role in AD treatment.

The findings from our study further indicate that the EXIT-25 may be among the most optimal measures nurses can use in the clinical setting to assess changes in executive function in older adults with an established diagnosis of AD. Hence, we do challenge the continuing practice of including the TMT in the standard neuropsychological battery for individuals with AD. For general screening of executive function in individuals who do not have an AD or dementia diagnosis, the TMT or COWAT could be recommended because the floor effects observed among those with AD may not be relevant and the tools are known to be sensitive markers of early executive dysfunction. To advance future exercise research in AD, multiple measures of executive function will be needed to improve the reliability and capture the diverse components of this construct. A latent factor similar to the one we developed in our study will improve the feasibility of such studies, as increasing sample sizes to maintain sufficient power after adjusting for multiple comparisons may not be practical in many research settings.

Since there is no benchmark for comparing the change in executive function induced by aerobic exercise, we compared the change in executive function to that of global cognition, the natural course of which is better understood in AD. The natural course of decline in the ADAS-cog over 6 months among community-dwelling older adults with mild-to-moderate AD is 3.2 points35. Our participants showed an ADAS-cog decline by only 1.4 points which is less than half of the natural decline. Participants’ decline in executive function was comparable to that in global cognition. Together, these findings support the potential therapeutic effects of aerobic exercise on maintaining or reducing decline in executive function in community-dwelling older adults with mild to moderate AD.

The strengths of this study included the use of a well-characterized AD sample, use of an adequate dose of aerobic exercise that was well-delivered and adhered to by the participants, and the breadth of cognitive assessments used to assess the multidimensional aspects of executive function. Our study findings are limited by our small sample size, the lack of a control group, the racial homogeneity, and the selection bias of including more participants with mild AD (n = 16) who had better function than those with moderate AD (n = 12). Despite these limitations, our study provides the preliminary evidence to support the appropriate assessment of executive function as a critical cognitive outcome for future AD exercise research. Our findings further highlight specific instruments that may best capture the change in executive function and the expected effect size for use in future aerobic exercise studies in AD.

Our findings have several clinical implications. First, nurses need to assess executive function and its changes in their older adult patients, especially those with AD, because executive dysfunction significantly affects their ability to carry out daily activities and the level of nursing care required12,14. Second, our findings indicate that behavioral assessment of executive function is sensitive in detecting executive dysfunction. For example, the Luria hands sequence in the EXIT-25 has been widely used by the neurologists in AD evaluation; however, nurses have not yet incorporated this method into standard nursing assessment. Last, exercise is an intervention nurses can easily implement with persons with AD. Our study provided evidence that regular aerobic exercise might help stall decline in executive function in AD.

Conclusion

Executive function is a critical cognitive outcome to be assessed in research and clinical practice in older adults with cognitive impairment. Executive dysfunction is prevalent in older adults with AD and has significant impact on activities of daily living and care needs. There are multiple components of executive function, so several measures are often needed to adequately capture this heterogeneous cognitive domain. The EXIT-25, BDS, and Stroop are able to identify changes in executive function, while the TMT and COWAT are not able to due to floor effects in older adults with mild to moderate AD. The EXIT-25 is particularly applicable to clinical use by nurses because it can be administered within 15 minutes and is easy to learn and use. From a research perspective, use of an executive function factor score like the one developed in this study is recommended in order to minimize the risk of type I error associated with multiple measures and multiple comparisons. Finally, aerobic exercise may be an effective intervention to maintain executive function among individuals with AD. Future, large-scale RCTs are needed to support these findings.

Highlights

Executive dysfunction is often an early sign of dementia, is prevalent in AD, and is a significant contributor to reduced ability to perform activities of daily living and care needs.

The EXIT-25, BDS, and Stroop are able to identify changes in executive function, while the TMT and COWAT are not secondary to floor effects in older adults with mild to moderate AD.

The EXIT-25 is particularly applicable to clinical use by nurses because it can be administered within 15 minutes and is easy to learn and use.

A single latent factor of executive function was sufficient to capture the heterogeneous elements of executive function.

Using a latent factor could minimize the risk of type I error associated with multiple measures and multiple comparisons in future studies.

Aerobic exercise may be an effective intervention to maintain executive function among individuals with AD.
