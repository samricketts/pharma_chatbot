Purpose:

Vision loss has been associated with negative health outcomes, but population level data on vision loss are lacking, and there are limited data on low vision-associated outcomes among women, minorities, and older age groups. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of vision loss in a nationally representative sample of older U.S. adults, examine its association with hip fracture, depression, anxiety, and dementia.

Methods:

Cross-sectional analysis of Medicare claims data from 2014. Blindness and low vision, hip fracture depression, anxiety, and dementia were identified using Chronic Condition Warehouse indicator variables based on ICD-9 and CPT codes. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to examine whether sociodemographic factors were associated with vision loss and to determine the relationships between vision loss and hip fracture and neuropsychiatric outcomes.

Results:

The prevalence of low vision in the Medicare population was 994/100,000 and increased significantly with age, Black (1,854/100,000) or Hispanic (2,862/100,000) race/ethnicity, female gender (1,181/100,000), and Medicaid eligibility (2,975/100,000). After adjusting for relevant comorbidities, low vision was significantly associated with hip fracture (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.54, 95% CI: 2.52–2.57), depression (AOR 3.99, 95% CI: 3.97–4.01), anxiety (AOR 2.93, 95% CI: 2.91–2.95), and dementia (AOR 3.91, 95% CI: 3.88–3.93).

Conclusion:

Blindness and low vision are common in older Americans, especially among racial and ethnic minorities and lower income individuals, and associated with hip fracture, depression, anxiety, and dementia. The prevention and treatment of vision loss may reduce health disparities and negative health outcomes in the aging population.


INTRODUCTION:

Vision is an important determinant of quality of life1,2, and vision loss is independently associated with reduced quality of life, negative health events such as falls and hip fracture3–11 and comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions including depression11–19, anxiety20, and cognitive impairment and dementia21,22. Much of this evidence for the relationship between vision loss and health outcomes comes from observational cohort studies (e.g. Framingham Heart Study) and population-based health surveys (e.g. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]). In these studies, visual function is either self-reported or directly measured, and health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and dementia are self-reported or determined based on survey instruments or research clinical assessments. Clinical assessments allow for precise measurement of quantitative outcomes, and self-reported measures are important for establishing relevance to patients, but both limit generalizability as they can only be administered to a limited number of subjects who, because of selection biases, may not be representative of the general population.

Administrative claims databases such as Medicare, which includes 97% of adults ages 65 and older in the United States23, have the advantage of being able to study an entire elderly population at risk and thus provide a broader view of disease burden, and Medicare data has been used to assess the healthcare costs and outcomes associated with vision loss11,19,24. However, these studies have used inconsistent claims-based definitions of vision loss. For example, some include both moderate and severe vision loss whereas others only include severe vision loss, and some allow for visual impairment in one eye but normal vision in the fellow eye whereas others require binocular vision loss. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has published a standardized definition of severe visual impairment based on ICD and CPT codes for research purposes, but to our knowledge, this definition of vision loss has yet to be implemented.

Many causes of vision loss, including glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are preventable or treatable. Characterizing populations at highest risk of low vision or adverse low vision-related outcomes therefore represents a significant public health intervention opportunity. There are limited data on outcomes associated with low vision among Medicare program participants, especially in women, minorities, and those over the age of 75, which are the fastest growing subsets of the adult population and the highest per-capita users of health care services in the United States. To address these gaps in knowledge, we examined the burden of low vision among uniformly insured older adults in the United States using Medicare claims data. Our study objectives were to (1) characterize Medicare beneficiaries with low vision diagnosis with respect to age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; (2) examine the association between low vision diagnosis and hip fracture; and (3) examine the association between diagnoses of low vision and depression, anxiety, and dementia. We hypothesized that the prevalence of vision loss in the Medicare population would be higher among minorities and Medicare beneficiaries who also receive Medicaid benefits, and that vision loss would be associated with a higher risk of hip fracture, anxiety, depression, and dementia.

METHODS:

This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. Patient consent was not required.

We performed a cross-sectional study of Medicare claims data from the year 2014. The Medicare program provides inpatient, outpatient insurance coverage for 97% of the U.S. population aged 65 and above. The Medicaid program provides additional coverage to individuals who are permanently disabled or have an income below the poverty line. Individuals who receive benefits from both programs are referred to as “dual eligibles”. The Beneficiary Summary File is a patient-level dataset available to researchers which contains Medicare and Medicaid enrollment and eligibility information, demographic variables. These data were merged with the Chronic Condition Warehouse and Chronic Health, Mental Health and Potentially Disabling conditions files, which together contain indicator and date of diagnosis variables for 66 chronic medical conditions, assessed annually for each beneficiary beginning in 1993. These variables are defined by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services using algorithmic searches of inpatient, outpatient, skilled nursing facility, and home health claims for diagnostic and procedural billing codes25. All study variables were derived from these files.

We included beneficiaries who were eligible for inpatient and outpatient Medicare benefits on or before January 1, 2014. The Medicare program was designed for adults ages 65 and older, but Medicare benefits can be given to individuals below age 65 with severe qualifying physical or mental disability. We excluded Medicare beneficiaries below the age of 65 from our analyses, because these individuals likely have non-normal patterns of chronic condition diagnoses, health care use, and surveillance. We designated dual eligibles as those receiving one or more month of Medicaid benefits in the 2014. Standard Medicare coding was used to identify race/ethnicity as White, Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Other/Unknown. Age was determined using the date of birth.

Blindness/low vision was defined by ICD-9 diagnosis codes (369.0–369.4). CMS has used this definition to mean moderate visual impairment or worse in the better seeing eye25. This was assessed between the first date of Medicare eligibility (or January 1, 1993, if Medicare eligibility began before then) and December 31, 2014. Other variables assessed were diagnoses of depression, anxiety, dementia, and hip fracture using the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse indicator variables (Supplemental Table 1)25.

We calculated the prevalence of low vision among Medicare beneficiaries and compared the frequency of blindness/low vision between strata of age, gender, race/ethnicity, and dual eligibility (a proxy for socioeconomic status). Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test and continuous variables were analyzed using a t-test or ANOVA as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression models were built to examine the outcome of vision loss as a function of demographic variables. Additional logistic regression models were built to examine the association between a diagnosis of blindness/low vision and incident diagnoses of hip fracture, depression, anxiety, and dementia. In these models, blindness/low vision was the primary exposure of interest, and sociodemographic characteristics, dual eligibility, and clinically relevant comorbid conditions were included as covariates. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW™ version 24. Confidence limits were calculated using standard regression modeling with an alpha of 0.05.

RESULTS:

The prevalence of low vision by age, race, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and sociodemographic characteristics of the low vision population in our study sample are presented in Table 1. Of 47,582,342 Medicare beneficiaries, 472,871 received a diagnosis of blindness/low vision, resulting in an overall prevalence of 994 per 100,000 individuals, or approximately one percent. The prevalence of low vision in the Medicare population increased with age, from 186 per 100,000 among those ages 65–69 to 4,521 per 100,000 among individuals ages 90 and older. The prevalence of low vision also varied by race and gender. Asian Medicare beneficiaries had the lowest frequency of low vision diagnosis (682 per 100,000), followed by Whites (882 per 100,000) and then Blacks (1854 per 100,000). Hispanic beneficiaries had the highest prevalence of vision loss at 2862 per 100,000, more than 2.8 times the overall prevalence. Vision loss was also more common among women (1,181 per 100,000) than men (758 per 100,000).

Table 2 displays the associations of low vision with sociodemographic characteristics. In a logistic regression model that included race/ethnicity, gender, age and Medicaid eligibility, Hispanic (OR 1.69, 95% CI: 1.67–1.71), Black (OR 1.74; 95% CI: 1.72–1.75), and Native American (OR 1.93, 95% CI: 1.86–1.99) beneficiaries had a greater adjusted odds of low vision diagnosis, as compared to Whites. Age was strongly associated with diagnosed vision loss, and female gender was associated with a minimally increased odds of low vision (OR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.12).

Of the 472,871 Medicare beneficiaries with blindness/low vision, 63,362 (13.4%) carried a diagnosis of hip fracture, 238,823 (50.5%) had depression, 185,095 (39.1%) had anxiety, and 236,249 (50.0%) had dementia or cognitive impairment. The results of regression analyses of the associations between low vision and these outcomes is shown in Table 3. After adjusting for demographic variables and medical comorbidities associated with hip fracture (rheumatoid arthritis, dementia, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, osteoporosis, epilepsy), low vision remained associated with an increased odds of hip fracture (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.169, 95% CI: 1.143–1.194). Analyses of depression and anxiety were adjusted for comorbid mental conditions, including anxiety (for analysis of depression), depression (for analysis of anxiety), bipolar disorder, and dementia. Blindness/Low vision was associated with both depression (AOR 1.186, 95% CI: 1.168–1.204) and anxiety (AOR 1.176, 95% CI: 1.159–1.194). Blindness/low vision was also associated with a greater odds of Alzheimer’s disease (AOR 1.44 95% CI: 1.415–1.464) and all-cause dementia (AOR 1.239, 95% CI: 1.223–1.254) after adjusting for comorbid obesity, tobacco use, diabetes, heart disease, stroke/TIA, hyperlipidemia, and traumatic brain injury.

DISCUSSION:

In this large observational study of over 42 million Medicare beneficiaries, we found that blindness and severe visual impairment is diagnosed in 1% of older adults in the United States. We also observed that vision loss is disproportionately diagnosed among older Americans that are female; Black, Hispanic, or Native American; and receiving Medicaid. Finally, we uncovered associations between low vision and hip fracture, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, and all-cause dementia after adjusting for confounders.

The national prevalence of visual impairment in previous studies of older adults varies from 0.6% to over 9% depending on the definition and method of ascertainment26. Our estimate of approximately 1% is consistent with studies that tend to use a more stringent definition of blindness and severe visual impairment26. A 2004 meta-analysis of studies examining the prevalence of legal blindness in the North America, Europe, and Australia linked to 2000 U.S. census data estimated a prevalence of 0.78%27, which when accounting for their younger population (aged 40 and over) is strikingly consistent with our results. We believe this consistent external comparison offers indirect evidence of the validity of the Medicare Chronic Conditions Warehouse definition of low vision for future epidemiologic research.

The sociodemographic associations with vision loss in our study are also consistent with acuity-based data and self-reported visual impairment from longitudinal epidemiologic studies and health surveys14. This reflects the known epidemiology of many common eye diseases, particularly those which, if unsuccessfully managed, lead to vision loss28. The incidence of glaucoma, diabetes, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts increases with age29. Glaucoma and diabetes are common among Hispanic, Black and Native American individuals30–32, and diabetic retinopathy is more common among minorities with diabetes33. Women have a 15% higher risk of age-related macular degeneration compared to men, but since age is the strongest risk factor for this condition, it is unclear if gender differences in life expectancy alone explain gender differences in vision loss34.

While some of the observed demographic differences in vision loss may be attributable to biological differences in disease risk, others may reflect disparities in care and the known underutilization of eye care services among minority populations35,36. Since over half of all-cause vision loss in older adults is preventable or treatable37, the identification of high-risk populations for low vision presents a unique opportunity to target early detection and treatment programs in order to prevent future vision loss and associated health outcomes and costs. Future work should clarify the attributable fractions of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for disparities in visual outcomes and the intervals in which they occur (e.g. screening, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment) to better estimate the effectiveness of these potential interventions.

Medicaid is provided to Medicare beneficiaries over the age of 65 who meet low income or disability requirements. Utilized as a socioeconomic proxy variable, we found that Medicaid recipients were more than three times more frequently diagnosed as severely visually impaired than non-recipients. The factors driving this observation are numerous and may vary at the individual and state levels, as Medicaid is administered at the state rather than federal level, with each state having unique income and disability thresholds for eligibility. The socioeconomic aspect of Medicaid eligibility (namely, low income) is known to be associated with limited access to and delivery of ophthalmic care35,36. For poor rural communities, the long distance required to travel to see the nearest ophthalmologist is also a contributing factor38. Medicaid use may also reflect an increased level of disability, either directly due to vision loss (which is itself a risk factor for nursing home placement11) or indirectly due to shared comorbidities (e.g. diabetes) associated with disabling health events (e.g. stroke).

Our results for depression and anxiety are consistent with prior studies demonstrating associations between low vision and reduced functional activity and social engagement, both of which are risk factors for depression and anxiety39. Vision also figures prominently in patients’ self-perceived health and overall well-being, and in some studies, self-reported visual dysfunction is more strongly associated with depression than actual visual acuity12. It is possible that the relationship between vision and mood disorders is bidirectional (that is, individuals with depression or anxiety may be less likely to seek eye care or adhere to treatment, resulting in vision loss). However, this would only apply to analyses of the associations with prevalent depression and anxiety, not incidence studies.

The association between vision loss and dementia likely shares similar mediators of loss of social interaction and independence but is additionally confounded by numerous common causes and risk factors, especially age. Some causes of vision loss have clear proximate causes that can also cause cognitive impairment, such as diabetes causing both diabetic retinopathy and small vessel ischemic disease leading to vascular dementia. Others such as age-related macular degeneration40 and glaucoma41 are thought to have primary neurodegenerative pathophysiologies that may share common risk factors with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and both have been implicated as potential risk factors for future neurodegenerative disease42,43. While we adjusted for a number of potential confounders, some (e.g. potential shared genetic risk factors, protective health behaviors) could not be captured.

The association between low vision and hip fractures is also consistent with prior studies3–11. A 2012 study of Medicare beneficiaries also found that cataract surgery was associated with a decreased risk of hip fracture44. In addition to decreased visibility of mechanical obstacles, vision loss is associated with physical inactivity, which is itself a risk factor for falls and hip fracture45,46. There may also be common causes of both vision loss and falls (e.g. diabetes causing both retinopathy and polyneuropathy), and vision loss and hip fractures are both strongly associated with age. We adjusted for many of these confounders, but some (e.g. physical inactivity, history of glucocorticoid use, history of skeletal deformity, gait-impairing peripheral or cranial neuropathy) were either not available in our datasets or are difficult to capture in administrative claims data.

This study has a number of strengths, including a very large and nationally representative sample size with attention to previously underrepresented demographic populations and the ability to adjust for many potential confounders. However, every study design has limitations. Retrospective administrative claims studies can be affected by exposure or outcome misclassification bias, as they rely on providers to enter accurate diagnostic codes. In particular, vision loss is typically diagnosed in the setting of an eye exam by an ophthalmologist, so a lack of access to ophthalmic care could result in under-ascertainment of the prevalence of vision loss. Visual impairment is variably defined in the literature, and the ICD-9 codes used in this study are reserved for relatively severe vision loss; as such, the exposure in question is probably accurate, albeit somewhat heterogeneous, but mild visual impairment may not have been captured. Our study design did not allow us to reliably distinguish between different causes of vision loss and whether they were reversible or irreversible. New ICD-10 definitions for blindness and low vision are more precisely linked to visual acuity47, so future studies may be better equipped to assess these relationships with greater precision. Finally, while the vast majority of adults aged 65 and older receive health care services through Medicare, a small minority do not and therefore may not apply to the results of this study. For example, military veterans receive eye care services through the Veterans Health Administration, which is notably different from Medicare in that it covers routine refractive and optometric services in addition to medical and surgical ophthalmology and might therefore yield different estimates for the prevalence of vision loss.

In this study we were able to better categorize the burden of severe vision impairment in a national older adult population. Furthermore, we were able to use a previously untested administrative claims-based definition and demonstrated its external validity for future use. Further studies incorporating Medicare claims datasets should work to focus on preventable vision loss in at risk populations.
