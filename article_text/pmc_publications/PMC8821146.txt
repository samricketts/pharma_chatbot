Background:

Periodontal disease and hepatitis C virus (HCV) represent chronic infectious states that are common in elderly adults. Both conditions have independently been associated with an increased risk for dementia. Chronic infections are thought to lead to neurodegenerative changes in the central nervous system possibly by promoting a proinflammatory state. This is consistent with growing literature on the etiological role of infections in dementia. Few studies have previously evaluated the association of periodontal disease with dementia in HCV patients.

Objective:

To examine whether periodontal disease increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) among hepatitis C patients in Medicare claims data.

Methods:

We used Medicare claims data for HCV patients to assess the incidence rate of ADRD with and without exposure to periodontal disease between 2014 and 2017. Cox multivariate regression was used to estimate the association between periodontal disease and development of ADRD, controlling for age, gender, race, ZIP-level income and education, and medical comorbidities.

Results:

Of 439,760 HCV patients, the incidence rate of ADRD was higher in patients with periodontal diseases compared to those without (10.84% vs. 9.26%, p&lt;0.001), and those with periodontal disease developed ADRD earlier compared to those without periodontal disease (13.99 vs. 21.60 months, p&lt;0.001). The hazard of developing ADRD was 1.35 times higher in those with periodontal disease (95% CI, 1.30 to 1.40, p&lt; 0.001) after adjusting for all covariates, including age.

Conclusion:

Periodontal disease increased the risk of developing ADRD among HCV patients in a national Medicare claims dataset.

pmcIntroduction:

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) refers to the major dementing illnesses. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia overall, occurring in 1 out of every 10 people over 65 years old. ADRD also includes Lewy body dementia (LBD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), and mixed etiology dementias (MED) [1]. As more people are entering the 65 and older age group, it is estimated that ADRD will increase in the future. These dementias are characterized by protein misfolding and propagation throughout the central nervous system. There is an increasing body of literature suggesting that chronic systemic inflammation, such as from chronic infectious states, can contribute to neuroinflammation and facilitate these neurodegenerative changes seen in dementia [2-4].

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and periodontal disease are two common infectious states that afflict elderly adults. HCV typically targets the liver and can manifest in acute or chronic forms, the latter of which can be complicated by cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Other organs can be involved with HCV, including the kidneys, endocrine organs, skin, and nervous system. With chronic HCV infection, 36.3% of newly diagnosed cases occur in those between 50 to 70 years of age. Most HCV infections in this population originated from exposure to HCV in blood or blood products administered in the 1960s through 1980s [5]. Periodontal disease refers to infection and inflammation of the gingiva and supporting structures of the teeth, which can lead to erosion of these structures and tooth loss [6]. It is suspected that up to 70% of adults over 65 years of age suffer from periodontal disease and has been associated with an increased risk for dementia [7-9].

There is growing literature that the infectious state, in general, has been linked to cognitive decline, with an inverse relationship between cognition and infectious burden [10-11]. Few studies have explored whether or not multiple infectious states would be synergistic in terms of their effect on cognition, particularly among a HCV population already at increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia. The objective of this study was to examine whether periodontal disease increases the risk of developing ADRD among HCV patients. We hypothesized that the risk of developing ADRD would be significantly higher in chronic HCV patients who had an increased infectious burden with periodontal disease.

METHODS

Data

We used Medicare claims from 2013 through 2017 for inpatient, skilled nursing facility, outpatient, and physician services. The 2013 data were used only to determine whether patients in the 2014 cohort sought periodontal care in 2013. We obtained patient residence (ZIP code), demographics, ADRD diagnosis date, indicators of health risks, and information on death date from Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary Files (MBSF). We obtained ZIP-level education and income from American Community Survey (ACS), and we assigned ZIP-level rurality of residence based on Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes. The Pennsylvania State University’s Institutional Review Board was obtained prior to the study.

Sample selection

The study population included Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries with HCV between January 01, 2014 and December 31, 2017 that were used in our previous project [12]. We defined an index date for each beneficiary as January 1 of the calendar year they entered the cohort. We then identified patients with chronic periodontitis as those having at least one claims with chronic periodontitis diagnosis (ICD-9 code: 523.4 or ICD-10: K05.3) or a history of periodontal disease (ICD-9 code: Z87.19 or ICD-10: V127.0, V127.9) between 2014 and 2017.

To ensure that we observed all claims, we selected beneficiaries who had continuous coverage of Part A (coverage for hospital and post-acute care services) and Part B (coverage for outpatient medical care) through the entire year. Patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage were excluded because we did not have claims for them. We excluded patients who did not seek any periodontal care in the previous year among those who had orthodontic claims prior to the cohort year to identify those with chronic periodontal diseases (i.e. those who did not have chronic periodontal disease while having orthodontic claims). Finally, we excluded beneficiaries with missing information on ZIP-level variables (income, education, or rurality of residence).

Outcome measure

The outcome measure was time to the incidence of ADRD from the index date. ADRD incidence was identified using the ADRD flag included in MBSF data. This flag was constructed based on the standard algorithm by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services: having at least one inpatient or skilled nursing facility, hospital outpatient, or carrier (physician) claim with ADRD diagnosis during the past 3 years. MBSF data also contain the ADRD initial diagnosis date. Using this date information, we identified patients who developed ADRD after the index date to include new ADRD patients (i.e., ADRD incidence) in the analysis.

All patients were followed up from the index date until they developed ADRD, died or reached the end of the study period (December 31, 2017).

Covariates

We controlled for patients’ demographic and neighborhood characteristics, including sex, race/ethnicity (White, African-American, Hispanic, and other race), age (&lt;55, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74, &gt;75), and ZIP-level rurality of residence, income, and education. We included a variable indicating whether beneficiaries were eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. This dual eligibility indicator captures an individual’s low-income status because Medicaid is available only for those with a low level of income. We also included indicators of conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, cardiac diseases, tobacco use disorder, and drug and alcohol related disorder).

Statistical Analysis

We first compared the probability of developing ADRD among patients with and without chronic periodontitis using a Kaplan-Meier curve. We then estimated Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between chronic periodontitis and ADRD incidence. We used Cox proportional hazards regressions for the following reasons: 1) different follow-up periods across beneficiaries, 2) the presence of loss to follow-up, and 3) the nature of the outcome (i.e., the first ADRD diagnosis is a one-time event). We fit the following three models: Model 1, which regressed having chronic periodontitis against the ADRD incidence (uni-variate regression); Model 2, which added to Model 1 several control variables, including patients’ demographic and neighborhood characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, age, rurality of residence, income, and education); and Model 3, which adjusted for all covariates used in Model 2 plus comorbidity indicators (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, cardiac diseases, tobacco use disorder, and drug and alcohol related disorder).

Sub-group analysis

In addition to the primary models, we estimated a fully adjusted model (Model 3) separately for the following age groups: 1) 50-64 (mid-life adults); 2) 65-69; and 3) ≥70. These separate analyses allow the association between chronic periodontitis and ADRD incidence to vary in each group.

The proportional hazards (PH) assumption, implying that the effect of a predictor of interest on the hazard of experiencing an event does not change over time, was satisfied in all Cox proportional hazards regressions.

We considered p&lt;0.05 as statistically significant in all analyses. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata version 15 (State-Corp LP, College Station, TX).

RESULTS

We began with a cohort consisting of 615,178 FFS Medicare beneficiaries with HCV. We excluded 125,142 patients who were not continuously enrolled in Part A and Part B. We then excluded 36,724 individuals who were diagnosed with ADRD before the index date and 841 patients who did not seek any periodontitis care in the year prior to the index year (i.e., those who did not have chronic periodontitis). Because of missing ZIP-level variables, including rurality, income, and education, 12,711 individuals were excluded. A total of 439,760 Medicare beneficiaries met our study inclusion criteria.

Table 1 presents characteristics of the study sample. Approximately 38% were female, 22% were African-American, and 44% were aged 65 and older. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (59%), drug and alcohol related disorder (44%), cardiovascular diseases (35%), and tobacco use disorder (34%). Patients with chronic periodontitis were more likely to be white or Hispanic, female, and eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, live in areas with high income and a high percentage of college graduates, and have comorbid conditions, compared with those without chronic periodontitis. The incidence rate of ADRD in the periodontal disease group was higher than in patients without periodontal disease (10.84% vs. 9.26%, p&lt;0.001, and those with periodontal disease had earlier diagnosis dates of ADRD in the Medicare claims earlier compared to those without periodontal disease (13.99 vs. 21.60 months, p&lt;0.001).

Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve comparing the unadjusted rate of ADRD incidence between patients with and without chronic periodontitis. Chronic periodontitis was associated with a higher proportion of incident ADRD compared to those without chronic periodontitis.

The results from Cox regression are shown in Table 2. The unadjusted hazard of developing ADRD from Model 1 was 78% higher in patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those without chronic periodontitis (unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.72-1.84). When adjusted for patients’ demographic and neighborhood characteristics (Model 2), the hazard of ADRD incidence in individuals diagnosed with chronic periodontitis was 70% higher than in patients without chronic periodontitis (adjusted HR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.65-1.76). In the fully adjusted model (Model 3), patients with chronic periodontitis had 35% higher hazard of developing ADRD than those without chronic periodontitis (adjusted HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.30-1.40).

Several patient factors were significantly associated with ADRD incidence. In the fully adjusted model (Model 3), the hazard of developing ADRD increased with every 5-year increase in age. Notably, compared with beneficiaries younger than age 55, the hazard of ADRD incidence was 6 times higher in those aged 75 and older. Females and patients residing in neighborhoods with higher income or rural areas had lower hazard of developing ADRD. In contrast, being African-Americans, eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, and living in areas with higher education increase the hazard of ADRD incidence. The presence of most comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and drug and alcohol disorder, were associated with higher hazards of developing ADRD, while patients with tobacco use disorder had lower hazard of developing ADRD.

Sub-group analysis

We examined time to ADRD development by the presence of periodontal diseases across different age groups (Table 3). Similar to the primary analysis, beneficiaries with periodontal disease developed ADRD earlier compared to those without periodontal disease, in all age groups.

Table 4 shows the association between chronic periodontitis and ADRD incidence from a fully adjusted model, across different age groups. In the 50-64 age group, the adjusted hazard ratio of developing ADRD between those with and without chronic periodontitis was 1.42 (95%: 1.34-1.51), while it was smaller among those aged 65-69: adjusted HR = 1.28 (95%: 1.20-1.38). Among those aged over 70, the corresponding ratio was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.21-1.37).

DISCUSSION

This study is, to our knowledge, one of the first analyses that has examined the relationship between periodontal disease exposure to incident ADRD among an HCV population. We found that the risk of developing ADRD was significantly higher in the HCV population with exposure to periodontal disease. This increased risk for ADRD in those exposed to periodontal disease was noted through all three models, highest in the univariate model and reduced but still positive in the fully adjusted model accounting for cardiovascular risk factors (Table 2). Although this increased risk was seen through all age subgroups, the subgroup within the mid-life age range (i.e 50-64) carried the highest risk (Table 4). A potential reason for this finding of increased risk for ADRD in the mid-life age group may be that this population is sicker since acceptance into Medicare prior to age 65 years must include the presence of significant disabilities or certain medical conditions such as end-stage renal disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

The association between periodontal disease and ADRD remained significant for the youngest age group of individuals in midlife after adjusting for demographic and medical covariates. This may potentially have clinical implications, possibly suggesting that primary prevention of dementia through modifying risk factors may need to begin during midlife or even earlier [13-14]. There is a paucity of data regarding whether treating periodontal disease in midlife or earlier may decrease risk of ADRD, particularly among a HCV population who are already at increased risk for dementia. As previously mentioned, periodontal disease is caused by a dysbiosis of the commensal oral flora, and there are a number of studies exploring the role of probiotics in improving outcomes in hepatitis patients in general, although most of these studies have sought to examine liver chemistries and hepatic encephalopathy, rather than incident ADRD [15-16]. Few studies have examined the effect of probiotic supplementation on cognitive function among individuals with AD and there is insufficient evidence at the present time to support the use of probiotics for individuals with ADRD [17].

Our results are consistent with previous studies that have found positive associations between infectious burden from multiple infections and poor cognition [2-4]. Our findings suggest a potential synergistic effect between periodontal disease and HCV on risk for dementia after up to 4 years of follow-up, with patients who have periodontal disease being diagnosed with ADRD earlier than those without it. Several mechanisms may explain this association. Systemic infections result in a pro-inflammatory state, which can lead to loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier, with resultant penetration of the CNS by inflammatory cells and microglial activation. It is possible that polymicrobial infections enhance this proinflammatory cascade and prolong its effects [18]. Periodontal disease can worsen liver disease through the generation of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species by the periodontal tissue in response to the pathogenic bacteria. Chronic, systemic inflammation also leads to insulin resistance, which can lead to accelerated atherosclerotic disease and dementia [18-20].

A notable strength of our study is the large sample size in the national claims dataset. We were able to adjust for a set of covariates in the full models, including demographic variables and vascular risk factors. Even after adjusting for all those covariates, a significant association was still found between periodontal disease and ADRD. Furthermore, we performed stratified analyses by age group.

One limitation of our study is potential misclassification, since the diagnoses of ADRD and periodontal disease are based on billing codes. Furthermore, the clinical severity of the dementia and clinician’s decision-making as to the diagnoses are not known. The temporal onset of periodontal disease could not be exactly established; however, this was mitigated in part by clarifying the chronicity of the ICD codes (i.e. chronic periodontal disease or history of periodontal disease). Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of duration of periodontal disease on risk for dementia.

Our study suggests a potential synergistic effect of periodontal disease and HCV on risk for ADRD. It is possible that periodontal disease may be a modifiable midlife risk factor among an HCV population at risk for dementia. This possibility warrants further investigation in future studies.

Conclusions:

In this analysis of an elderly HCV population in a large national Medicare dataset, we found a statistically significant increase in the risk of developing ADRD when exposed to periodontal disease. This risk was highest in the 50-64 year-old age subgroup but continued throughout all ages. Future prospective observational studies will be helpful to characterize this association.
