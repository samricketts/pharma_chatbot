Objective:

The narrative description (ND) test objectively measures the ability to understand and describe visual scenes. As subtle differences in speech occur early in cognitive decline, we analyzed linguistic features for their utility in detecting cognitive impairment and predicting downstream decline.

Methods:

Participants (n=52) with normal cognition to mild dementia performed the ND test (watched twenty 30-second video clips and described the visual content). Cognitive function was followed for up to 5 years. We computed simple linguistic features such as content efficiency, speech rate, and part of speech and unique word counts. We examined: (1) relationships between cognitive status and ND score and linguistic features; (2) ability to discriminate early cognitive impairment from normal cognition using ND score and linguistic features; and (3) whether ND score and linguistic features were associated with future cognitive functional decline.

Results:

Many of the linguistic feature metrics were related to cognitive status. Many of the linguistic features could distinguish between the cognitively normal group and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Dementia groups. The area under the curve (AUC) for ND score alone was 0.74, with a non-significant increase to 0.78 when adding mean word length. Among participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) at the first visit, a smaller number of words plus more interjections or a lower ND score at baseline were predictive of future cognitive decline.

Conclusions:

While many linguistic features were associated with cognitive status, and some were able to detect early cognitive impairment or predictive of future cognitive decline, all the features we tested seem to have been captured by the ND score. Thus, adding linguistic measures to the ND test score did not add to its value in assessing current or predicting future cognitive status.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with early and prominent deficits in episodic memory, paired-associate learning, lexical diversity, semantic knowledge/access, and executive functioning (Ossenkoppele et al., 2016; Weintraub et al., 2012). Although global cognitive screening measures such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al., 2005) and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) are commonly used for detecting cognitive impairment in clinical settings (Roalf et al., 2013; Shulman et al., 2006), they often lack sensitivity in detecting the earliest manifestations of cognitive decline (O’Caoimh et al., 2016), and are prone to education bias (Poptsi et al., 2019).

As an alternative, recent work has suggested that subtle differences in speech may be one of the earliest indicators of cognitive decline in AD, and thus may have utility as an early screening tool. Connected speech, also termed spontaneous discourse, is a type of natural speech that manifests during conversation or storytelling, and particularly during tasks that require verbal descriptions of pictures, events, or videos. Analysis of connected speech in dementia is well-documented (Bayles et al., 2004; Kavé &amp; Goral, 2016; Mendez &amp; Ashla-mendez, 1991; Smith, 1989), and previous studies have analyzed connected speech for semantic informational content (Bayles et al., 1989), vocabulary richness (Hernández-Domínguez et al., 2018), acoustics (Al-Hameed et al., 2016), idea density (Ahmed et al., 2013), and part of speech usage (e.g., noun counts, pronoun counts, percentage of verbs) (Mueller, Koscik, Clark, et al., 2018), among other metrics. Early work in connected speech analysis was applied to past presidential addresses and showed that Ronald Reagan suffered significant linguistic and cognitive decline even before his official AD diagnosis (Gottschalk et al., 1988). In addition to common impairments in associative memory, confrontational naming, and semantic processing noted in those with AD, analysis of spontaneous discourse may capture specific cognitive and linguistic impairments related to speech production that are undetected by standard cognitive measures.

While cognitive and linguistic impairments are easily noticed in overt cases of dementia, declines in connected speech have been shown to be associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Cuetos et al., 2007; König et al., 2015; Mueller, Koscik, Hermann, et al., 2018). Specifically, compared to cognitively normal participants, MCI groups have been reported to have lower speech production (number of words), fluency, and semantic information units (“core words”) (De Lira, et al., 2014; Filiou et al., 2020); higher number of pauses and a slower speech tempo (Toth et al., 2018); a lower number of semantic units (Fleming &amp; Harris, 2008); and more pronouns, more repetition, and a lower rate of content efficiency, suggesting circumlocution (Boschi et al., 2017). A limitation of these previous findings is that the outcome metrics require detailed coding by a human observer (e.g. fillers, mazes, utterances), which can be burdensome to implement in a clinical setting. Thus, automated scoring measures that can be derived using computer algorithms are of particular interest. Here, we examined such an automated scoring approach in an exploratory study using longer connected speech segments than available in most previous studies.

Unfortunately, findings on connected speech in MCI are highly varied, likely due to differences between the samples, analysis methods, and tasks. One way to support the codified use of connected speech analysis in screening for cognitive impairment is to examine its impact when used in conjunction with more standard cognitive screening measures, such as the MMSE or MoCA. Recent work has shown a marked improvement in the diagnostic ability of the MMSE with the inclusion of linguistic features elicited through picture description tasks (Fraser et al., 2018). In that study, features of particular relevance in improving the MMSE were: noun count, noun-verb ratio, and word frequency. Here, we examine whether adding automatically derived linguistic metrics to MoCA scores improved the sensitivity and specificity of early detection of impaired cognitive function.

A limitation of most studies that have employed picture description tasks is the small number of available picture stimuli and the requirement for time-consuming scoring methods that employ rubrics with subjective scoring rules. The narrative description (ND) test overcomes these limitations by using a repository of short video clips as stimuli for describing visual scene information and the implementation of an objective scoring method based on automated natural language processing (see Methods). Previously, the ND test has been used to identify decrements related to central vision loss (Costela et al., 2019) and hemianopia (Costela et al., 2018), and more recently we demonstrated the efficacy of the ND score in discriminating between levels of cognitive impairment (Reeves et al., 2020). Here, we extend those findings, asking whether simple linguistic features that can be extracted from narrative descriptions using computer algorithms can improve detection of early cognitive decline and predict future cognitive decline in a small longitudinal study. In our exploratory study, we hypothesized that: (1) extracted linguistic features would differ across levels of cognitive impairment; (2) some linguistic factors would be associated cross-sectionally with early cognitive impairment; (3) the sensitivity and specificity of the ND test score for early cognitive impairment might be improved with additional linguistic information; and (4) the ND test score and linguistic features may have utility in predicting participants who will have cognitive decline in the future.

Methods

Participants

Participants were recruited into the study from 2015 to 2018 from a longitudinal cohort of individuals from the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Individuals in the MADRC longitudinal cohort were recruited from earlier studies at MGH, the MGH Memory Disorders Unit, and the community around Boston, MA. Annual longitudinal cohort evaluations adhered to the standard National Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set protocol (Besser et al., 2018), and included a clinical/neurological evaluation, assessment of functional abilities, and a standard neuropsychological test battery (Weintraub et al., 2018) to inform a consensus-based diagnosis for each participant according to standard research criteria (Besser et al., 2018). The Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) served as a variable of interest for defining dementia severity and for capturing change over time. The CDR is a semi-structured clinician rating scale administered to both the participant and a reliable informant to characterize cognitive and functional performances across six key domains applicable to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgement and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home and Hobbies, and Personal Care (Hughes et al., 1982; Okereke et al., 2011; Okereke et al, 2012). The global CDR score spans from 0 to 5 (normal to terminal) and is derived from an algorithm combining individual scores across the six domains assessed. In our sample, participants scored in the 0, 0.5, 1 and occasionally 2 range— equating to normal, questionable, mild, or moderate levels of impairment)(Hughes, et al., 1982). In addition to global CDR ratings, the sum of the individual scores across the six domains, termed the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score, was also calculated to provide a finer level of granularity in functional outcomes and to provide a more sensitive metric of change over time (Morris, 1993). Basic demographic information for this sample is reported in Table 2, whereas a more detailed characterization of the sample, including neuropsychological test results by cognitive status group, are reported previously (Reeves et al., 2020).

Participants were eligible for our study if they were over 65 years of age, had normal or corrected to normal vision, and had an initial global CDR rating of 0 to 1.0. Following the UDS diagnosis procedures (Besser et al., 2018), individuals were assigned a syndromic diagnosis of mild dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive decline (SCD) (Molinuevo et al., 2017), or normal cognition. For participants with MCI and dementia, we restricted the sample to those with a clinical diagnosis judged “due to AD” based on standard research criteria (Albert et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011). All diagnoses were made by a specialist physician (behavioral neurologist or geriatric psychiatrist) following the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set version 3.0 (UDS 3.0) Coding Guidebook (2015)’s implementation of standard clinical criteria for dementia (McKhan et al, 2011) and MCI (Albert et al, 2011). Since UDS 3 does not include a diagnosis of SCD, we operationalized the standard research diagnosis (Milinuevo et al, 2017) as meeting the UDS 3 code for “impaired not MCI” (i.e., having either impairment on testing or cognitive concerns, but not both in the same domain as required for MCI), with the additional requirement that the participants themselves had to have concerns about their cognition (those in whom only the informant or clinician had such concerns were excluded, as were those with testing abnormalities for whom no one had cognitive concerns). Participants were considered “cognitively normal” if they had neither cognitive concerns nor impairment on neuropsychological testing. We obtained all available data from up to six annual visits to the MADRC. The number of visits varied from one to six per participant, with an average of 3.6. The number of visits was highest in the normal cognition group as they were recruited earliest into our study.

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature of the study was explained. The study and protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Mass General Brigham Health Care and was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Narrative Description (ND) Task and Video Clips

The ND test is an objective measure of the ability to perceive, understand, and describe a visual scene extracted from a movie or documentary (Saunders et al., 2014). Participants viewed a set of 20 movie clips, each 30-s in duration. Following each video clip, the participant responded to two open-ended prompts: (1) “Describe this clip as if you were describing it to someone who has not seen it before;” and (2) “Are there any other details about the clip that you might want to mention?” Audio content from the clips was not available, and participants viewed the scenes on a 68cm (27-in) screen (display diagonal) from 50 cm away. Of the 52 participants, 43 provided responses on 20 clips, and the others provided between 16 and 19 responses. There was no statistical difference in the number of responses across the cognitive-status groups (Kruskal-Wallis, χ2 =1.66, df=3, p=0.65).

The 20 movie clips used in the study were taken from a publicly available online database of 200 30-s Hollywood video clips (Costela &amp; Woods, 2019; supplementary Table S1). The clips represented a range of scenes including conversation, indoor/outdoor settings, action sequences, and facial expressions. Clip genres included drama (e.g., Julie &amp; Julia), action/adventure (e.g., Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee), animation (e.g., Coraline), and documentary (e.g., Food, Inc). Audio files of each participant’s narrated scene description were initially transcribed with MacSpeech Scribe Pro (Nuance Communications, Burlington, MA, USA) software and then edited for accuracy by laboratory personnel. At least two laboratory personnel reviewed each transcription.

ND Scoring

The transcriptions were objectively scored using a “wisdom of the crowd” approach that compared each new response, pairwise, to each response to the same video clip in a reference group (Saunders et al., 2014). This reference group, described previously (Saunders et al., 2013) consisted of 126 individuals (66 crowd-sourced and 60 lab-sourced) who were 22–85 years old, 60% female, and had normal cognition. There were at least 32 responses from the reference group for each video clip. The number of unique words, after removing stop words (very common words that have low information content (e.g. “the”, “a”, “an”, “so”, “what”), such that they do not add much meaning to a sentence) shared by each pair of responses (“new” response and one response from the control database), and disregarding repeated instances of the word in either response, produced a shared-word count for each pair of responses. The ND score for each video clip for each participant was the average of these shared word counts. The more content in the description that was common to the new response and the set of responses provided by the reference group (i.e., shared words), the higher the ND score.

Linguistic features

We generated linguistic-feature descriptors from the full transcribed text of each response (description). Unique words, total words, and type-token ratio were generated with in-house MATLAB scripts. Part of speech factors (e.g., noun count, adjective ratio) were created by comparing each word in a response to a dictionary. We used a publicly available dictionary of the top 5,000 words from the 600 million word Corpus of Contemporary American English (Davies, 2008, 2011). The dictionary came with frequency tags and part of speech tags, which were generated using the Constituent Likelihood Automatic Word-tagging System (CLAWS, version 7, University Centre for Computer Corpus Research on Language at Lancaster University, UK) part of speech tagger. Parts of speech listed in the dictionary used included: articles, conjunctions, demonstratives, prepositions, adjectives, determiners, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, verbs, and interjections. Extracted linguistic features are listed in Table 1.

As measures of lexical diversity and description efficiency, we calculated: (1) Type-token ratio (TTR; Chotlos, 1944) as the ratio of unique words (types) over the total number of words (tokens) in the response; (2) HD-D (hypergeometric distribution-D; McCarthy and Jarvis, 2010); and (3) Content efficiency as the ratio of ND score over the number of words in each response. TTR has a long history of use in lexical evaluations, but has been criticized as varying with text length (number of words; McCarthy and Jarvis, 2007; McCarthy and Jarvis, 2010). HD-D overcomes limitations of TTR and some other measures of lexical diversity (McCarthy and Jarvis, 2010). As some responses could not be scored because there were fewer than 42 unique words, we combined all of the responses for each subject to calculate HD-D. This provided a single HD-D score per subject. Content efficiency is a new measure that seeks to determine the information density or word efficiency. Responses with higher ND scores, which contain more information about the video content, and lower numbers of words will produce higher content efficiency scores, and vice versa.

Spearman correlations between the linguistic features and ND score are reported in supplementary Table S2. ND score was highly correlated (p≤0.001) with most of the linguistic features (rho≥0.62, p≤0.001), except response length, HD-D, and any proportions except proportion of nouns (rho=0.49, p≤0.001). Most of the counts were strongly correlated with other counts. HD-D and TTR were not correlated (rho=0.08, p=0.59). TTR was highly correlated with all word counts, whereas HD-D was not significantly correlated with word counts.

Data sharing

Data will be made available on request to the communicating author and completion of a data sharing agreement.

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata/IC 14 (Stata-Corp, College Station, TX). We used logarithms of total word count and description duration, as the distributions were skewed and the transformation improved the residuals. Ratios were subject to a logistic transformation. To examine the relationship between extracted linguistic features and cognitive status, we asked whether each of the linguistic features: (1) varied across the cognitive groups, that is, was there a relationship (change in metric with progressive change in cognitive status), using ordered logistic regression models; and (2) differed in the SCD, MCI, and dementia groups as compared to the cognitively normal group, using linear mixed models (interval variables) and mixed-effect Poisson regressions (count variables), that accounted for random effects of participant and video clip. For the parts of speech count mixed-effect Poisson models, we included “number of words” as a covariate to avoid biasing the results to people who were more loquacious.

To determine whether linguistic features could distinguish early cognitive impairment from normal cognition, we used univariate logistic regressions. Since our sample sizes were small, for this analysis we defined early cognitive impairment as the combination of our SCD and MCI samples (n=27); this combination also serves clinical settings where detection of SCD or MCI is of interest. Participants with a diagnosis of dementia, who are easily distinguished from those with normal cognition with existing measures, were excluded from this analysis. Then, to determine whether linguistic features improved the discrimination of early cognitive impairment from normal cognition, we started with a backwards logistic regression that included the ND score and all of the linguistic feature variables that had p&lt;0.10 in the prior univariate logistic regressions. Regression diagnostics (e.g., variable inflation factor) and Spearman correlations between ND score and the linguistic features were examined. Then a forwards regression was employed to determine the final model. To examine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the ND test score, we calculated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC), and used logistic regression to determine whether inclusion of any of the extracted linguistic features improved discrimination (increased the AUC). Similarly, to examine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA, we calculated the ROC, and used logistic regression to determine if the ROC was improved by including any of the extracted linguistic features.

Each year, some people with SCD will convert to MCI (about 5% per year; Parfenov et al., 2020) and some people with MCI will convert to dementia (about 6% per year; McGrattan et al., 2022). To assess whether the ND test score and linguistic features could predict future decline, we examined longitudinal CDR-SB data using a linear mixed model with age fully crossed with baseline cognitive status group, and random effects of participant and age within participant to allow each participant a different trajectory of CDR-SB (decline within the fitted model). Then, we conducted a survival analysis (Cox proportional hazard regression) of time to an increase in CDR-SB rating of at least a one-point which compared the cognitive status groups. The most predictive combination of factors was found using both backwards and forwards stepwise Cox regressions, examination of regression diagnostics, and confirmed using nested regressions to test the value of added terms.

Since there were many models (analyses), but our sample size was small, as a compromise between the risk of type II errors and the multiple comparisons problem, we report nominal p-values, and accepted p≤0.01 as statistically significant, and report terms with 0.10≤p&lt;0.01 as trends. This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered.

Results

Participant Characteristics

The 52 participants in the study (median 80 years, range 65–99; 22 men and 30 women), were classified into four groups: normal cognition (n=16), SCD (n=14), MCI (n=13), and mild dementia (n=9). As shown in Table 2, the groups were similar in gender (χ2 (3)= 5.63, p=0.13) and education (ordered logistic regression, z=1.29, p=0.20). As expected, greater age was associated with worsening cognitive status (ordered logistic regression, z =2.30, p=0.02). The ND test took an average of 28.8 minutes to complete, and this was similar across groups (ANOVA, F(3,46) =1.94, p=0.14). The total number of words per subject, summed across all responses of each subject, varied between 341 and 5,296 (median 1,140, mean 1,379).

We obtained follow-up data on cognitive status, CDR-SB, and MoCA at up to six annual visits (mean 3.6) and a duration of up to 5.5 (mean 1.8) years after the ND test. As recruitment began with participants with normal cognition or SCD, the number of visits varied between cognitive-status groups, with participants with dementia (mean 2.1) and MCI (mean 3.1) having fewer visits than participants with SCD (mean 4.0) or normal cognition (mean 4.6). During the tracked period, three of thirteen subjects (23%) who were initially classified as MCI (at time of ND testing) converted to mild Dementia. None of the normal cognition or SCD subjects converted to Dementia. Six of sixteen subjects (38%) who were initially classified as normal cognition converted to SCD, and one of sixteen (6%) converted to MCI. Two of the fourteen subjects (14%) initially classified as SCD were later classified as normal cognition, while five of fourteen (36%) progressed and were later classified as MCI.

Linguistic features varied between the cognitive status groups

To determine whether linguistic features extracted from participant responses were related to cognitive status (Normal cognition, SCD, MCI, or Dementia), we employed ordered logistic regression models. If the metric is to be useful, its score should increase or decrease with an improvement or worsening in cognitive status. Such a relationship was found with ND scores (ordered logistic regression: z=4.25, p&lt;0.001), with ND score being lower in each of the successive groups (Table 1). As illustrated in Figure 1, many of the linguistic features (total word count, word length, speech rate, type-token ratio, HD-D, content efficiency, and counts of adjectives, conjunctions, interjection utterances, nouns, content words, and unique words, and proportions of demonstratives, nouns and unique words; p ≤0.01; Table 2) varied with cognitive status, while many other linguistic features showed trends (0.10≥p&gt;0.01; Table 2). We asked whether a linear combination of linguistic measures might be a better predictor of cognitive status than ND score. Using forward and backward ordered logistic regressions that began with all of the significant (p≤0.01) linguistic features, a model that included TTR, HDD, and content efficiency was found to predict cognitive status. That multiple regression model was not better than ND score (Akaike’s information criterion = 124 versus 126).

To further examine those differences in linguistic features between the cognitive-status groups, we used linear mixed models or mixed-effects Poisson regressions. Compared to the normal-cognition group, the dementia group had worse performance on all of the examined linguistic features, except content efficiency (p=0.02), counts of demonstratives (p=0.39), determiners (p=0.03), and pronouns (p=0.12), and proportions of adjectives (p=0.48), adverbs (p=0.27), articles (p=0.57), conjunctions (p=0.04), determiners (p=0.56), interjections (p=0.05), prepositions (p=0.09), verbs (p=0.04), and content words (p=0.08). Compared to the normal-cognition group, the MCI group had fewer total words (p=0.006), a shorter description duration (p=0.01), lower counts of adjectives (p=0.01) and unique words (p=0.005), and a trend (0.10≥p&gt;0.01) for lower content efficiency, a higher type-token ratio, lower counts of adverbs, nouns, content words and content words, and proportions of unique words. While ND scores were not different between the normal-cognition and SCD groups (p=0.40), there were trends for shorter word length, and lower counts of adverbs, conjunctions, demonstratives, interjections, and verbs, and proportions of articles and conjunctions in the SCD than the normal-cognition group. Paired comparisons between each group were derived from each model and are shown in Table 2. The pattern of differences between groups (as illustrated in Figure 1) was consistent with the trends (“correlations”) reported in the previous paragraph.

Linguistic features detect early cognitive impairment

Given the ample interest in diagnostic tools that might detect early signs of cognitive impairment, we used logistic regression to determine whether any of the linguistic metrics could discriminate normal cognition from early cognitive impairment (SCD or MCI). In our small sample, there were trends for many of the factors to discriminate early cognitive impairment: ND scores (z = 2.19, p=0.03), total words (z=2.05, p=0.04), word length (z=2.14, p=0.03), description duration (z=1.84, p=0.065), type-token ratio (z = 1.92, p=0.06), and counts of adjectives (z=2.07, p=0.04), adverbs (z=2.28, p=0.02), conjunctions (z=2.14, p=0.032), demonstratives (z=1.66, p=0.10), interjections (z = 1.92, p=0.05), and nouns (z=2.00, p=0.05), and unique words (z = 1.81, p=0.07), and proportions of conjunctions (z=1.82, p=0.07).

Sensitivity and specificity of the ND score and linguistic metrics

We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the ND score in distinguishing normal cognition from early cognitive impairment (i.e., SCD or MCI). To examine the diagnostic ability of the ND score, we calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and measured the area under the curve (AUC), which for the ND score alone was 0.72 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.56 to 0.88) (Figure 2).

We asked whether the discrimination of the early cognitive impaired participants by the ND test score could be improved (Cleves, 2002) by the addition of linguistic factors. Each of the metrics that had discriminated between the normal cognition group and the early cognitive impairment group (prior section) was added, separately, to the ND score. We found that the addition of many of the linguistic metrics marginally increased the AUC (indicating improved discrimination), but not significantly in our small sample (p ≥0.33). A backwards stepwise regression model included the mean word length, counts of adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, and demonstratives. However, all of those factors except mean word length were highly correlated with the ND score (Spearman r≥0.66, p&lt;0.001), and had high variance inflation factors (VIF ≥9.5), indicating that the independent variable was highly collinear with other variables in the model. A forwards stepwise regression model that added word length, which was only weakly correlated with ND score (r=−0.29, p=0.04), tended to improve discrimination of mild cognitive impairment from normal cognitive status over ND score alone (likelihood ratio = 4.33, df=1, p=0.04). The AUC of the ND score was marginally improved by a including mean word length (AUC = 0.78, 95%CI: 63 to 92%), however, in our small sample, this was not a significant improvement (χ2(1)=0.79, p=0.37). Figure 2 shows the ROC curves of ND, and ND plus mean word length.

Sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA and linguistic metrics

Given that the MoCA test is a commonly used screening measure for cognitive impairment, we compared the diagnostic ability of the MoCA to that of the ND test, and asked whether adding any of the linguistic metrics would improve discrimination of the MOCA. Alone, the MoCA had an AUC of 0.76 (95%CI: 0.62 to 0.90), which was similar to the ND score alone (AUC = 0.72, χ2(1) for the difference=0.25, p=0.62). As MoCA and ND were strongly correlated (Spearman r=0.69, p&lt;0.001), adding ND scores to MoCA did not improve the AUC (0.78, χ2(1)=0.60, p=0.44). To examine whether other linguistic metrics improved discrimination using MoCA, we conducted a backwards stepwise logistic regression model that included many linguistic factors, which except for word length, had high variable inflation factors (VIF&gt;12.5) and were correlated with the MoCA scores (Spearman r≥0.27, p ≤0.08). A forwards stepwise regression model showed that discrimination of early cognitive impairment by the MoCA was improved by word length (likelihood ratio = 11.1, df=1, p=0.001). Figure 3 shows the ROC curves of MoCA alone, MoCA combined with ND, and MoCA combined with the word length (AUC=0.89, 95%CI: 0.79 to 0.99).

ND and predicting the progression of cognitive impairment

As noted above, we obtained follow up data (CDR-SB and neuropsychological measures) for some participants following their baseline visit, which was the visit in which the ND test was completed. First, we asked how individuals changed over time using the outcome measure CDR-SB (wherein high CDR-SB scores indicate worse cognitive function). For that, we fit a linear mixed model that predicted CDR-SB from age fully crossed with baseline cognitive status group, with participant and age within participant as random effects (allows each participant to have an offset and different slope, respectively). For the purposes of these analyses, we considered the cognitive group at the baseline visit. The raw CDR-SB scores and fits of that model for all 52 participants are shown in Figure 4. As expected, CDR-SB scores increased with increasing age (z = 3.36, p=0.001). In our small sample, with only a modest number of time points, especially in the MCI and dementia groups, there was no difference in the rate of change in CDR-SB with age between the four groups.

We anticipated that individuals with MCI and dementia would be more likely to have a change in cognitive function than individuals with SCD or normal cognition. As a visualization, we plotted a Kaplan Meier survival estimate which is shown in Figure 5. This describes a non-parametric measure of the time to an event (in this case, a change of CDR-SB score ≥ 1). For the formal analysis, we used a Cox proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972) that predicted time to a change in CDR-SB score ≥ 1 compared to the previous visit (~1 year). As expected, the MCI (z=4.09, p&lt;0.001) and dementia (z=4.49, p&lt;0.001) groups declined more quickly than the normal cognition group.

To determine whether ND scores at the first visit were predictive of future decline in cognitive function within each baseline group (a worsening of CDR-SB score ≥ 1 between visits), we calculated normalized ND scores by taking the difference between each individual’s measured ND score and the average ND score for their diagnostic group at baseline. We implemented a Cox proportional hazards model that included an interaction between normalized ND scores and cognitive status group. A lower normalized ND score was associated with a greater likelihood of a change in CDR-SB ≥ 1 (i.e. a cognitive decline event) in the SCD (HR: 2.94, 95%CI: 1.11 to 7.75) group, but not in the MCI (HR: 1.05, 95%CI: 0.13 to 8.84) or Dementia groups (HR: 1.94, 95%CI: 0.31 to 12.0) than the cognitively normal group. Then, we asked whether linguistic features were able to predict downstream change in CDR-SB scores in the cognitively normal participants and those with SCD. For this, we implemented backwards stepwise Cox models that incorporated factors that were significant or approached significance (p≤0.15) in univariate Cox regressions (conjunctions, interjections, nouns, number of words, speech rate, type-token ratio, unique words) and then a forwards regression with a criterion of (p≤0.10). The resulting model (pseudo-R2 = 0.54) found that fewer total words (HR: −0.11, 95%CI: −0.21 to −0.01) and more interjections (HR: 8.6, 95%CI: 1.02 to 16.1) in the narrative description were predictive of a higher risk of cognitive decline.

While not the focus of this study, we noted that risk of a decline in cognitive function in our small dementia group tended to be associated with the use of fewer adjectives (HR: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.02 to 1.03) and fewer demonstratives (HR: 0.10, 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.86) in their narrative descriptions.

Discussion

Many linguistic features extracted from the responses provided during the ND test varied with the level of cognitive impairment (e.g., Table 2, Figure 1). Consistent with previous literature (Ahmed et al., 2013; Boschi et al., 2017; Filiou et al., 2020; Fleming &amp; Harris, 2008; Hernández-Domínguez et al., 2018; Kavé &amp; Goral, 2016; Mendez &amp; Ashla-mendez, 1991; Mueller, Koscik, Clark, et al., 2018; Mueller, Koscik, Hermann, et al., 2018; Smith, 1989), we found that as cognitive impairment worsened, participants spoke fewer words, fewer unique words, had a higher proportion of unique words in the total words (type token ratio), had a lower content efficiency, had a slower speech rate, and, when corrected for the number of words, used fewer nouns, adjectives, and interjections. These effects are expected given the notable deficits in semantic processing and associative memory reported in this population. That noun and adjective counts decreased and content efficiency decreased suggests a conversion to “empty speech,” or less descriptive speech that may be circumlocutive in nature (Boschi et al., 2017).

Many of the linguistic features extracted from the ND responses could discriminate the participants with early cognitive decline from the participants with normal cognitive status. In our small sample, the diagnostic ability of the ND test score was improved by the addition of the average word length, but not by any of the other linguistic features (Figure 2). Interestingly, discrimination using the MoCA was also improved when average word length was included (Figure 3). These findings point to the possible clinical utility of adding linguistic feature measurement to standard global cognitive tasks such as the MoCA or MMSE when screening for early cognitive decline, which is consistent with the work by Fraser et al. (2018). However, like Fraser et al. (2018), who used more complex linguistic metrics, we also found that the improvement in discrimination when adding linguistic features was quite modest. It is possible that more complex processing of responses to produce measures such as syntactic complexity and fillers and mazes might be more effective than the simple linguistic metrics employed in this study (which were amenable to full automation, not requiring human intervention for processing of the responses with current technologies).

The ND test score and some linguistic features were related to future changes in cognitive status (CDR-SB score) in the SCD group in our sample. Since cognitive decline may precede functional decline (Zahodne et al., 2013), it is worthwhile to study the course of AD and its impact on linguistic metrics. Our modest results extend the previous work of Yancheva et al. ( 2015), who showed that lexicosyntactic, acoustic, and semantic features were predictive of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as a measure of disease progression in a mixed dementia sample. Here, we employed the clinical scale CDR-SB as a marker of longitudinal change, which has shown to be more closely associated with cognitive status compared to the MMSE (Balsis et al., 2015). However, we found that only the SCD group differed from the normal-control group in risk of change in our study, which was surprising and requires confirmation in a larger sample that follows the participants with MCI or Dementia groups for longer durations.

There were limitations of this study including the small sample size (N = 52), still smaller when broken down by baseline cognitive diagnostic group. Further, diagnostic classification was based on clinical and cognitive assessment without biomarker data to confirm the presence of a neurodegenerative disease process. Thus, the underlying etiology of cognitive impairment, especially in the milder ranges of our sample, may be due to other factors besides suspected early AD. Future work would benefit from replication in biomarker confirmed samples. Our longitudinal results are also limited, given that participants had on average only 3.6 visits (2.5 years follow-up) and participants with MCI and dementia had fewer visits than those with normal cognition or SCD. Despite these limitations, the results of this small study show that there is value in the use of the ND test, the ND score, and linguistic features for discrimination of early cognitive impairment and prediction of future decline. However, the specifics of the findings (e.g., which linguistic features were best at predicting current status or future decline) should be taken with great caution, given the small sample size. Further, we limited our choice of linguistic features to those which could be readily calculated using modest computation, without any human intervention or processing. In this study, we used human transcription, but transcription could be automated with current technologies. Our intent was to identify linguistic features that could be included in automated processing of the responses, with the possibility of giving scores in near to real time. Thus, it is entirely possible that other, more sophisticated measures of language and speech production would be better than those employed in our study.

Future studies should repeat this study examining the ability of the ND test to predict longitudinal change over multiple years with even follow-up for all participants. Being able to predict an increased likelihood of imminent cognitive decline could have value in recruitment for clinical trials and in clinical settings. Previous studies (e.g., Fraser et al., 2015) have shown that metrics derived directly from the audio files (e.g., hesitations) can also be indicative of cognitive decline, and future work is worthwhile on signal processing of audio files to derive such metrics.

In summary, linguistic features differed across varying levels of cognitive impairment and were able to predict the presence of early cognitive impairment (MCI and subjective cognitive decline groups). Linguistic features were able to marginally improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ND test. Also, select linguistic features and the ND test were able to predict downstream cognitive decline as defined as an increase in the CDR-SB score. Despite these relationships between linguistic features and cognitive status, the addition of the simple linguistic features employed in this study did not substantially increase the ability of the ND test to discriminate early cognitive impairment or the prediction of future change, in our sample. This suggests that the ND test, despite its lack of explicit focus on language, captures all or most of the changes in speech production found in early cognitive impairment.

Key Points

Question:

Can we improve the Narrative Description test by adding detailed linguistic information?

Findings:

Most linguistic features were related to cognitive status, but did not substantially improve the discriminability of the Narrative Description test in detecting early mild cognitive impairment.

Importance:

There was preliminary evidence that the Narrative Description test might be predictive of future decline in cognitive function in people with early cognitive impairment.

Next steps:

Further studies are needed to further develop the Narrative Description test to determine whether it could be employed remotely for frequent in-home testing.

We have no conflicts of interest to declare.
