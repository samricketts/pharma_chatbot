BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:

We sought to compare the post-acute and long-term care experience of Medicare beneficiaries with and without Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), and whether differences changed from January 1, 2007 to September 30, 2015.

DESIGN:

Retrospective cross-sectional trend study using Medicare claims linked to the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Minimum Data Set.

SETTING:

CMS-certified skilled nursing facilities (skilled nursing facility (SNF), n = 17,043).

PARTICIPANTS:

Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥66 years (n = 6,614,939) discharged from a hospital to a SNF who had not lived in a nursing home during the year before hospitalization.

MEASUREMENTS:

ADRD was defined by the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse. Outcome measures included: (1) successful discharge defined as being in SNF less than 90 days, then discharged back to the community, alive without subsequent inpatient health care for 30 continuous days; (2) became long-stay resident in SNF; (3) death in SNF within 90 days; (4) hospital readmission within 30 days of entering SNF; and (5) transferred to another nursing home within 30 days of entering SNF.

RESULTS:

Successful discharge of beneficiaries with ADRD increased from 43.4% in 2007 to 53.9% in 2015 (average annual percent change (AAPC) = 2.1 (95% CI = 2.0–2.2)); those without ADRD also increased (from 59.1% to 63.6%, AAPC = 0.9 (95% CI = 0.7–1.1)) but not as fast as those with ADRD (P &lt; .01). The proportion of all beneficiaries who became long-stay or were readmitted to the hospital decreased (P &lt; .05). The proportion with ADRD who became long-stay was nearly three times higher than those without throughout the study (15.0% vs 5.5% in 2007; 11.3% vs 4.3% in 2015).

CONCLUSION:

Though disparity in ADRD in becoming long-stay residents remains, the increase in successful discharges among those with ADRD also stresses the increasing importance of community as a care setting for adults with ADRD.

INTRODUCTION

Between 2010 and 2016 20.3% of Medicare beneficiaries received post-acute care (PAC) services in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) after being discharged from the hospital.1 The improving Medicare Post-Acute-Care Transformation Act of 2014 mandated addition of a national quality measure for successful community discharge from PAC services. Although the goal of PAC rehabilitation is to maximize independence and facilitate a safe community transition, some SNF patients may be awaiting family arrangements to provide care at home or for selection of a long-term nursing facility. Some may need to stabilize and to get their numerous medical conditions to a manageable care plan. But generally, returning to and remaining in the community after an illness, injury, or surgery reflects the quality of PAC2 (https://impactcollaboratory.org/). Although some studies have assessed inpatient rehabilitation facilities patients’ success in community discharge,3,4 little is known about SNF patients’ success in returning and staying home post-discharge.

SNF admission is often the gateway to becoming a long-term nursing home resident. And, Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) patients are more likely to become long-stay residents. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) and other policy initiatives strongly encourage community based long-term care for ADRD patients.5 In 2012, under the ACA the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) could penalize hospitals for readmissions in less than 30 days for certain conditions. Successful transitioning from the hospital to a SNF is even more complicated for persons with ADRD. For example, patients with ADRD whose behavioral problems surpass the SNF’s capacity to accommodate them are at high risk of rehospitalization or transfer to a different SNF.6 For this reason, SNF administrators may be less likely to accept patients with ADRD after acute hospitalization. Indeed, one study reported that SNF personnel believe hospital personnel downplay ADRD patients’ behavioral problems to increase their chances of SNF admission.6 For these reasons, real and perceived about patients with ADRD, we hypothesized that Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD would experience more negative outcomes than those without ADRD, in terms of their likelihood of successfully returning home, experiencing rehospitalization, dying in the SNF, becoming a permanent nursing home resident, or transferring to another SNF, and we assessed whether the differences changed between 2007 and 2015.

METHODS

Study Population

Our sample was drawn from 100% of Medicare SNF claims linked to the CMS Minimum Data Set, which are mandatory clinical assessments for all nursing home residents of Medicare-certified nursing homes, from January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2015 (with follow-up for post-discharge outcomes dated through December 31, 2015). The study period was chosen to include only events occurring before the introduction of the ICD-10 coding system. We included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥66 years who were discharged alive from the hospital and admitted to a SNF within 1 day of hospital discharge. We excluded those with history of being in a nursing home within the 12 months (using the MDS) before hospital admission because they were likely to be sicker and/or more severely demented.7

Main Exposure Measure

We identified Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD using the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) flag in the Medicare beneficiary summary file as of the day of hospital discharge. The CCW algorithm identifies beneficiaries as having ADRD if they have one of 24 ICD-9 codes present on one or more inpatient, SNF, HHA, outpatient, or carrier claim over a 3-year look-back period.8 This definition has a sensitivity (0.85) and specificity (0.89).9 We believe this is sufficient to assess changes in trends because (1) the measure did not change during the study period (ICD-9 codes were used throughout) and (2) we hypothesized post-discharge outcomes of ADRD patients may differ from those without ADRD, in part due to perceptions of ADRD patients. In other words, regardless of truly having ADRD, if beneficiaries’ have an ADRD diagnosis, then healthcare providers perceive that they have ADRD.

Outcome Measures

We assessed trends over our study period in seven outcome measures. First, we defined successful discharge as being discharged alive from a SNF to the community within 90 days of SNF admission without subsequent inpatient healthcare utilization for 30 continuous days. Second, we defined becoming a long-stay resident as remaining in the SNF more than 90 days after SNF admission. Third, we defined dying in the SNF as dying within 90 days of SNF admission. Fourth, we assessed death within 90 days after discharge from the SNF (after being in the SNF at least 90 days). We assessed rehospitalization two ways: within 30 days and within 90 of hospital discharge. For both rehospitalization measures, those who died in the same timeframe were censored. Finally, we assessed transfer to another NH within 30 days of entering the SNF. To clarify “SNF,” our focus is not on SNF coverage for payment, but rather PAC in a SNF which is typically short-stay or ≤90 days. We used the sequence of claims and the MDS to identify outcomes.

Statistical Analyses

First, we assessed the overall change in number of beneficiaries with and without ADRD from 2007 to 2014 (for this we excluded 2015 because it was a partial year). Trends for each outcome were then assessed on annual cohorts of beneficiaries who were discharged from the hospital to a SNF, adjusting for age, sex, race, dual-eligibility, Medicare Advantage penetration (zipcode of residence), and percent dual-eligible (zipcode of residence). We used STATA version 16 software to obtain adjusted predictive margins and standard errors. We evaluated monotonic trends by joinpoint regression using Joinpoint software,10 which has the same underlying assumptions as simple regression and allows for input of estimates and standard errors. To determine if the trend was statistically significant we used the average annual percent change (AAPC) and its associated P-value. We also compared AAPC differences in trends between those with and without ADRD. All analyses were stratified by beneficiary ADRD status.

Sensitivity Analyses

Because our analyses included all FFS beneficiaries discharged from the hospital to a SNF, we wanted to determine if results would be similar for a more homogenous group or if our findings were driven by certain subgroups. Therefore, we performed the same trend analyses for patients hospitalized for hip fractures and were discharged from the hospital to a SNF. Codes used to define hip fractures were 820.xx.

All analyses were conducted after establishing a data use agreement with CMS and obtaining final approval from Brown University’s Institutional Review Board.

RESULTS

We identified 2,134,798 beneficiaries with prevalent ADRD (243,321 or 11.4% were included in multiple years) and 3,582,546 without (654,274 or 18.3% were included in multiple years) who otherwise met study eligibility criteria. The average age of beneficiaries with ADRD discharged from hospital to SNF was close to 84 years in 2007, 2011, and 2015; the average age of those without ADRD was approximately 80 years at the beginning, middle, and end of the study (Table 1). About two-thirds of those with and without ADRD were female. The average proportion with Medicare Advantage penetration in the residents’ zip code increased from 2007 to 2015 for those with (17.8%–28.7%) and without ADRD (17.6%–28.1%). A few (7.4% n = 486,715) of beneficiaries were referred to a hospice within 90 days of entering the SNF or in the 90 days following SNF discharge; of those, 85.2% died.

The number of beneficiaries with ADRD discharged from the hospital to a SNF increased 36.3% from 211,518 in 2007 to 288,361 in 2014 (2015 was a partial year, AAPC = 3.1 (0.3, 5.9)). There was no significant change in the number of beneficiaries without ADRD discharged from the hospital to a SNF from 2007 to 2014 (AAPC = 1.1 (−1.6, 3.9)). The proportion of traditional Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD who had a successful discharge from the SNF to the community increased from 43.5% in 2007 to 50.9% in 2015 (AAPC = 2.0 (1.8, 2.2)) (Table 2 and Figure 1). Successful discharge for those without ADRD also increased (from 59.0% to 62.9%, AAPC = 1.0 (0.8, 1.2)), but not as fast as for those with ADRD (AAPC difference (ADRD – No ADRD) = 1.0 (0.8, 1.2), P &lt; .01). The proportion of beneficiaries with ADRD who became long-stay nursing home residents decreased (from 15.0% in 2007 to 11.3% in 2015, AAPC = −3.6 (−4.4, −2.8)); those without ADRD decreased also (from 5.5% to 4.3%, AAPC = −3.4 (−4.3, −2.6)) similar to those with ADRD (P = .70). However, the proportion of those with ADRD who became long-stay was nearly three times higher than those without. The proportion of beneficiaries with ADRD who died within 90 days of entering the SNF decreased from 2007 (16.9%) to 2015 (15.8%, AAPC = −0.7 (−1.2, −0.2)); those without ADRD decreased as well from 13.9% in 2007 to 12.8% in 2015 (AAPC = −1.4 (−1.8, −0.9)), faster than those with ADRD (AAPC difference (ADRD – No ADRD) = 0.9 (1.7, 0.1), P &lt; .01). The proportion of beneficiaries with ADRD who died within 90 days of discharge from the SNF did not change from 2007 (8.9%) to 2015 (8.2%, P = .7); those without ADRD decreased from 6.3% in 2007 to 5.7% in 2015 (AAPC = −1.1 (−1.5, −0.6)), faster than those with ADRD (AAPC difference (ADRD – No ADRD) = 0.9 (1.7, 0.1), P &lt; .01). The proportion of beneficiaries discharged and rehospitalized within 30 days and 90 days decreased among both those with (AAPC = −2.8 (−3.6, −2.0) and AAPC = −1.7 (−2.3, −1.2)) and without ADRD (APC = −2.9 (−3.6, −2.1) and AAPC = −2.1 (−2.7, −1.5)) during the study period, though not significantly different from each other (P = .90 and P = .20, respectively). The proportion of beneficiaries discharged to SNF and transferred to another nursing facility decreased among both those with ADRD from 5.0% to 4.3% (AAPC = −2.0 (−3.3, −0.7)) and without ADRD from 3.5% to 2.8% (AAPC = −3.1 (−4.4, −1.8)), though not significantly different from each other (P = .20).

Results of Sensitivity Analyses

Overall, 9.5% of patients discharged had claims for being hospitalized with hip fracture. The number of beneficiaries discharged from the hospital to a SNF increased 35.8% from 23,485 in 2007 to 31,882 in 2014 (2015 was a partial year and therefore excluded, AAPC = 3.1 (0.7, 5.6)). There was no significant change in beneficiaries without ADRD discharged from the hospital to a SNF (AAPC = 0.6 (−1.8, 3.1). Those hospitalized for hip fracture, with and without ADRD, experienced more successful SNF-to-community discharges after acute hospitalization, fewer deaths, rehospitalizations, long-stays, and transfers to other nursing facilities within 30 days of entering the SNF from 2007 to 2015 (P &lt; .05) (Table 3). The gap between those with and without ADRD in successful SNF-to-community discharges after acute hospitalization narrowed, as rates of successful discharges increased faster among those with ADRD (AAPC difference (ADRD – No ADRD) = 0.9 (0.6, 1.2)).

DISCUSSION

In general, traditional Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD have worse outcomes than those without ADRD, but the gap is narrowing with respect to returning home from the SNF, surviving and not being rehospitalized. From 2007 to 2015, Medicare beneficiaries experienced more successful SNF-to-community discharges after acute hospitalization, due to fewer rehospitalizations, long-stays, and transfers to other nursing facilities within 30 days of entering the SNF. The gap between those with and without ADRD in successful SNF-to-community discharges after acute hospitalization narrowed, as the rates of successful discharges increased faster among those with ADRD. Deaths within 90 days of discharge to SNF did not change among beneficiaries with ADRD, yet the mortality rate decreased among the non-ADRD group. Notably, the gap between those with and without ADRD in becoming long-stay remained; those with ADRD were nearly three times as likely to become long-stay residents.

Studies have reported an increase in the number of adults living with ADRD.11 This is reflected in our study showing an increase in ADRD patients discharged from the hospital to the SNF overall and also in our sensitivity analysis among hospitalizations for hip fractures. Our results may indicate that the greater number of patients with ADRD discharged home may reflect healthier people being diagnosed with ADRD at earlier stages.

Higher rates of successful discharge from SNF to the community and fewer rehospitalizations, long-stays, and transfers to other nursing facilities among beneficiaries with ADRD over a decade are quite encouraging. Previous studies have reported persons with ADRD experience frequent transitions across the range of care, especially into and out of hospital and SNF settings.12,13 And, nearly half of long-stay nursing home residents suffer from ADRD.14,15 Our data suggest that the proportion of patients with ADRD who become long-stay residents after entering the SNF after being hospitalized is decreasing.

It is not surprising that rates of rehospitalization after hospital discharge to SNF decreased for all beneficiaries. In October 2012 a policy was mandated by the ACA to penalize hospitals with high readmission rates for certain conditions.16 Readmission rates for some SNFs may have been high before 2012 because of the change in use of SNF care. Most SNFs (&gt;90%) are dually certified as a SNF and as a nursing home.17 Thus, a facility that offers skilled care often also provides long-term care services that Medicare does not cover. Ideally, SNF care is provided to restore function to patients discharged from acute hospital care before transitioning back to the community. In the decade before 2012, use of SNF care after acute hospitalization had greatly increased in part because of the shift of nursing homes from serving life long residents to facilities treating increasingly medically complex patients seeking PAC for recuperation after hospitalization. This may in part have been driven by a financial incentive to take advantage of the short-term Medicare benefit. Medicare covers up to 100 days after 3 days of hospitalization whereas Medicaid pays for most of long-term care, the Medicare payment for SNF services being higher than that for Medicaid. In other words, some patients may have been sent to the SNF as long as the financial benefit was available and then sent back to the hospital. Yet since the 2012 policy, that practice likely diminished.

Our result of decline in long-stay residents, with and without ADRD, helps to explain why occupancy in nursing homes continues to decline even though the number of beds has been steadily declining.18–20 In nursing homes in states with no or nursing home-specific certificate-of-need programs (designed to curb healthcare spending), the number of beds has decreased since 1992.21 The decline in long-stay residents may also be a reflection of the number of nursing home closures. Facilities with large proportions of long-stay residents tended to have high Medicaid occupancy,22 and those facilities were most at risk of closure.23

Our study was subject to several limitations. First, discharge data for the Medicare Advantage population are not reliable and therefore were not included. Given the rapid growth of Medicare Advantage, which has a strong disincentive for hospital use, the results observed may not reflect the overall population aged 66 years and older. Second, the proportion of ADRD we reported likely includes some false-positive and false-negative ADRD cases; however, the CCW algorithm is the only approach that can identify a broad sample of beneficiaries with ADRD across community and nursing home settings in hospitalization data. Still, regardless of how ADRD is diagnosed, the trends reveal an increase in successful discharges but a steady gap in becoming long-stay residents with a nearly threefold risk among those with ADRD. Third, we did not assess the geographic availability of PAC services; hence some patients may have been discharged to the community because of access rather than recovery. Fourth, we could not account for health beliefs, financial resources, availability of an appropriate caregiver (paid or unpaid), or cultural differences which may have influenced discharge to and remaining in the community. Finally, a potential limitation is that certain cohorts of beneficiaries discharged from the hospital to SNFs could have driven the results. However, sensitivity analyses confirmed overall results with a homogenous group. Among patients who had been hospitalized for hip fractures, trends for those with and without ADRD were in the same direction and the same estimates were statistically significant as were found for the overall group of beneficiaries with two exceptions.

We examined the trends in outcomes among Medicare beneficiaries discharged to SNF with and without a diagnosis of ADRD and found that many outcomes improved for all persons but that successful discharge rates, going home and remaining there, improved more rapidly for persons living with dementia than for persons without dementia. It may be that practices with regard to hospitalization may have influenced the trends in addition to practices in the SNF. Thus, more research is needed to understand what is driving the reduction in transfers, deaths, and long-stays among patients with ADRD discharged from hospital to SNF. In addition, the increase in successful SNF to community discharges stresses the increasing importance of community as the care setting for adults with ADRD.
