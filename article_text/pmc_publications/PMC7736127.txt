We used plasma neuronal extracellular vesicles (nEVs) to examine how neuronal insulin signaling proteins relate cross-sectionally to brain structure in non-demented older adults with varying levels of cortical amyloid. EVs enriched for neuronal origin by anti-L1CAM immunoabsorption were isolated from plasma of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET study participants (n=88; age: 77 [SD: 6]). nEV levels of phosphorylated insulin signaling cascade proteins were quantified. Brain volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume were assessed using 3T MRI. After adjusting for demographic variables and EV marker Alix, higher levels of a neuronal insulin signaling composite measure were associated with lower WMH and greater temporal lobe volume. Secondary analyses found levels of downstream protein kinases involved in cell survival (p70S6K) and tau phosphorylation/neuroinflammation (GSK-3β) to be most strongly associated with WMH and temporal lobe volume, respectively. Associations between neuronal insulin signaling and lower WMH volume were attenuated in participants with elevated cortical amyloid. These results suggest that enhanced neuronal proximal insulin signaling is associated with preserved brain structure in non-demented older adults.

1. Introduction

Insulin signaling is necessary for the maintenance of cellular functions (Tan et al., 2019; Zheng and Quirion, 2004). Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling through insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) promotes the survival and health of neuronal cells by ensuring the maintenance of intracellular energy needed for synaptic function (e.g., by promoting glucose uptake by the GLUT4 transporter), enhancing synaptic plasticity, inhibiting proapoptotic signaling pathways, and regulating processes such as inflammation and tau phosphorylation, which are central components of Alzheimer’s diseases (AD) pathogenesis (Chua et al., 2012; Emmanuel et al., 2013; Gonçalves et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2009). Deficiencies in the insulin signaling system, both within and outside of the central nervous system, have been linked to cognitive dysfunction and AD (De Felice et al., 2014; Diehl et al., 2017; Talbot et al., 2012), and biochemical processes occurring in AD, including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, have been shown to disrupt insulin signaling in the brain (Lourenco et al., 2013; Pearson-Leary and McNay, 2012; Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2017). Accordingly, interventions that enhance or normalize neuronal insulin signaling are being examined for their potential therapeutic benefit in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (Craft et al., 2020).

The precise link between neuronal insulin signaling and neurodegeneration has not been fully elucidated. Previously, our group used plasma neuronal extracellular vesicles (nEVs) to show that phospho-Tyr-insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-Tyr-IRS-1) levels (permissive of insulin signaling) are positively associated with a larger volume of a predominantly lateral temporal cluster of voxels (extending into temporoparietal regions), in individuals with MCI/mild AD (Mullins et al., 2017). While these findings support the notion that neuronal insulin signaling may play a role in regional neuronal viability, they did not address the contribution of the signaling cascades downstream of IRS-1, which mediate a range of potentially relevant biological processes. Activation of the insulin signaling pathway via tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 initiates a complex chain of phosphorylation events, including activation of the protein kinase B (Akt), inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK-Bβ), and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The Akt/mTOR pathway has been shown to regulate cell survival and inhibition of apoptosis, whereas GSKβ regulates tau phosphorylation and neuroinflammation (Cai et al., 2012; Datta et al., 1999; Llorens-Martin et al., 2014; Schubert et al., 2004). Activation of these same pathways has also been linked to oligodendrocyte survival and myelin production, suggesting that insulin signaling proteins may also influence cerebral white matter viability (Wang et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2007).

Although nEV-based evidence for abnormal neuronal insulin signaling has been provided in the context of preclinical AD (Kapogiannis et al., 2019, 2015) and age-related cognitive decline (Eren et al., 2020), how neuronal insulin signaling and the regulation of the insulin signaling cascade relates to underlying brain changes that precede the onset of dementia remains unclear. The goal of the current study was to move beyond clinical associations and examine in vivo how nEV levels of a set of proteins that operate at multiple levels within the insulin signaling cascade relate to neuroimaging markers of brain structural integrity in non-demented older adults. Specifically, we measured nEV levels of phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (p-IGF-1R), insulin receptor (p-IR), and p-Tyr-IRS-1. Additionally, we measured phosphorylated levels of protein kinases previously implicated in AD that operate in the canonical insulin pathway downstream of the aforementioned insulin receptors: phospho-Akt (p-Akt), phospho-GSK-3β (p-GSK-3β), and phospho-p70 S6 kinase (p-p70S6K) (Llorens-Martin et al., 2014; Salkovic-Petrisic et al., 2006; Spilman et al., 2010). We related nEV levels of these proteins to MRI measures of total and regional brain volume and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume. We hypothesized, based on previous evidence, that non-demented older adults with nEV biomarkers suggesting reduced neuronal insulin signaling would have lower volumes in temporal lobes. Based on increasing evidence that brain amyloid can inhibit IR activation and downstream IRS-1 signaling, the current study also examined whether the relationship between insulin signaling protein levels and brain structural integrity differed for older adults with elevated cortical amyloid levels (Talbot et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2008).

2. Methods

2.1 Study Design and Participants

Participants were enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, an ongoing community-based cohort study that began in 1987. A total of 15,792 participants from four communities in the U.S were initially recruited between 1987 and 1989 (visit 1) and asked to return for six additional visits (The ARIC Investigators, 1989). At visit 5 (2011-13), approximately 2,000 participants were selected to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; criteria for selection provided in the Supplementary Methods). Among these, 346 non-demented participants from three sites were selected to undergo PET imaging as part of the ARIC-PET study (Gottesman et al., 2016). The current study selected for inclusion of 84 ARIC-PET enrollees at the Washington County, MD study site with available plasma. Four additional participants who had available plasma and MRI data, but with no PET imaging, were also randomly selected from the Washington County study site for study inclusion (total N=88). A study inclusion and exclusion flowchart is provided in Figure 1A. We used a complete case analysis. ARIC Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States. All participants gave written informed consent at each study visit.

2.2 Neuronal Extracellular Vesicle Isolation and Protein Assays

We isolated nEVs from plasma samples collected during ARIC visit 5 (2011-2013) and stored at −70C°. The EV isolation methods used in the current study have been detailed previously (Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2018; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Mustapic et al., 2017). Plasma samples were defibrinated with thrombin, and then total plasma EVs were precipitated with ExoQuick exosome precipitation solution (System Biosciences, Inc., Mountainview, CA). The EV pellets were resuspended in ddH2O supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, and Thermo Fisher Scientific; DBS++). To immunoprecipitate enriched nEVs, we used mouse anti-human CD171 (L1 CAM) biotinylated antibodies (clone 5G3, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). We used electrochemiluminescence assays (Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD) to measure p-IGF-1R, p-IR, and p-Tyr-IRS-1 (cat. no. K15151C), and p-Akt, p-GSK-3β, and p-p70S6K (cat. no. K15115D). Alix, a canonical EV marker, was quantified using calorimetric ELISA (cat. no. CSB-EL07673HU; Cusabio Biotech Co., Houston, TX) and used as a measure of EV recovery. All assays were conducted in duplicate and the average measurement was used for analyses. The intra-assay CV ranged from 2.8% to 10.4% for all assays. Investigators involved in nEV isolation and protein quantification were blinded to neuroimaging parameters.

2.3 Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Brain MRI scans conducted at visit 5 were performed using a 3T scanner (Siemens Verio) and analyzed at the ARIC MRI Reading Center (Mayo Clinic) using methods that have been detailed previously (Knopman et al., 2015). Magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE), axial T2*gradient echo and axial T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences were obtained. Freesurfer (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) was used to determine total and regional brain volumes from MPRAGE sequences (Fischl et al., 2002). We examined multiple regions of interest (ROIs), including lobar volume (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital), and the AD signature region, which is a composite measure of brain regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s-related atrophy (i.e., the combined volume of the parahippocampal, entorhinal, inferior parietal lobules, hippocampus, and pre-cuneus) (Dickerson et al., 2011). We used FLAIR images with a computer-aided segmentation program to calculate white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume (Raz et al., 2013). We used criteria for WMH that are consistent with WMH of presumed vascular origin, outlined by Wardlaw et al., 2013. WMH volume was log-transformed because of skewness. All MRI analyses were adjusted for total intracranial volume.

2.4 Florbetapir (Amyloid) PET Imaging

Cortical amyloid was measured using florbetapir PET neuroimaging obtained within a year of the brain MRI. PET scans were coregistered with MP-RAGE sequences. As described in detail elsewhere, a 20-minute (4 × 5 minute) uptake scan was conducted beginning at 50 minutes after the intravenous injection of the florbetapir isotope (Gottesman et al., 2016). Image quality was reviewed by the PET Image Analysis Center at Johns Hopkins. We then calculated standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using an automated region of cerebellar gray as the reference region, and manually applied 34 regions of interest (ROIs) in the standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space (Wong et al., 2010). The current analysis used a measure of global cortical florbetapir uptake derived from the volume-dependent weighted average of the orbitofrontal, prefrontal, and superior frontal lobes; the lateral temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes; the precuneus, and the anterior cingulate, and the posterior cingulate regions. Consistent with previous ARIC-PET studies, elevated cortical amyloid was defined a priori as a global SUVR above the ARIC-PET study sample median (1.2) (Gottesman et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2018).

2.5 Covariate and Clinical Assessment

Participant race and sex were self-reported at ARIC visit 1. We used participant age at visit 5, concurrent with the time of the blood draw. APOE was genotyped using the TaqMan assay (0/1/2 ε4 alleles; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cognitive status (normal cognition vs. MCI) was adjudicated by an expert panel of physicians and clinical neuropsychologists based on a comprehensive neuropsychological and functional assessment provided at visit 5 (criteria provided in Supplementary Methods) (Knopman et al., 2016).

2.6 Statistical Analysis

We used multivariable linear regression to examine the association of log-transformed nEV proteins with MRI parameters. Models were adjusted for intracranial volume, age, sex, and Alix concentration (log-transformed). Alix is a canonical marker of small EVs that was included to adjust for differential nEV yield, as has been done previously (Eren et al., 2020). We created an insulin signaling pathway (ISP) composite score using principal component analysis (PCA) that included all measured nEV proteins. Full PCA results are provided in Supplementary Table 1. The first principal component, which explained 73% of the variance, was used to create the ISP composite score that was used in the analysis of MRI parameters. A higher ISP composite score is consistent with enhanced insulin signaling. For MRI measures that were significantly associated with the ISP composite score, we conducted secondary analyses to examine the association of specific nEV insulin signaling proteins with the designated MRI variable. We conducted an additional analysis that included all nEV proteins included in the same multivariable model to determine whether individual nEV proteins showed statistically independent relationships with MRI parameters. Interaction terms followed by stratified analyses were used to evaluate the modifying effects of amyloid status (positive/negative) on the relationship between the ISP composite score and designated MRI measures. A 2-sided P-value &lt;0.05 was used to designate statistical significance. Analyses were conducted using Stata, version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

3. Results

3.1 Participant Characteristics

A total of 88 participants were included in the current analysis (mean [SD] age, 76.6 [5.5] years). Twenty-three (26%) participants met criteria for MCI, whereas others were cognitively normal at the time of blood draw and neuroimaging. Thirty-four (40%) of the 84 participants who received florbetapir PET neuroimaging were amyloid positive (global SUVR &gt;1.2). Participant demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1. Compared to the full visit 5 ARIC cohort, participants included in the current sample, representing only a subgroup of one field center, were more likely to be white, female, and without a college education (Supplementary Table 2). Correlations between nEV levels of proximate insulin signaling proteins are provided in Figure 1B. Of note, we found that nEV insulin signaling protein levels did not differ significantly by diabetes status or other vascular risk factors (Supplementary Figs. 1–4).

3.2 Neuron Extracellular Vesicle Insulin Signaling Proteins and Brain MRI Measures

After adjusting for age, sex, and nEV concentration, a higher ISP composite score was significantly associated with greater temporal lobe volume and lower WMH volume (Table 2). Based on age-related associations derived from the same multivariable regression model, we can estimate that each standard deviation decrease in the ISP composite score is equivalent to the effect of three and four additional years of age (e.g., the effect of aging from 76 to 79) on temporal lobe and WMH volume, respectively. Associations between ISP composite score and total brain volume, AD Signature Region volume, and frontal, parietal, and occipital lobe volumes were nonsignificant. Results were similar in sensitivity analyses that adjusted for potential confounders, including APOE ε4 status and vascular risk factors (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, smoking status; Supplementary Table 3). Adjustment for cognitive impairment (normal vs. MCI) and exclusion of cognitively impaired (i.e., MCI) participants did not change the results.

Results of secondary analyses examining the association of individual insulin signaling proteins with temporal lobe volume and WMH volume are displayed in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. Higher nEV levels of p-IGF-1R, p-IR, and p-Tyr-IRS-1 (indicative of enhanced insulin signaling) as well as p-GSK-3β and p-p70S6K were associated with greater temporal lobe volumes in adjusted regression models (P’s&lt;0.05). However, only the association with p-GSK-3β was significant after Bonferroni correction (0.05/7; P&lt;0.007). All nEV proteins were associated with lower WMH volume at a P&lt;0.05 significance level, but none of these associations survived Bonferroni correction. In multivariable models that included all six nEV proteins, only p-GSK-3β remained significantly associated with temporal lobe volume (β=4.01; 95% CI: 0.82, 7.20; P=0.014), and only p-p70S6K remained significantly associated with WMH volume (β=−0.58; 95% CI: −1.09, −0.08; P=0.025; see Supplementary Table 4 for full results).

3.3 Amyloid Status as an Effect Modifier

Amyloid status (positive/negative) did not modify the association between ISP composite score and temporal lobe volume (interaction-P=0.92; Figure 4A). However, the association of ISP composite score with WMH volume was modified by amyloid status (interaction-P&lt;0.001), wherein the association between higher ISP composite score and lower WMH volume was stronger among amyloid-negative participants (Figure 4B). Interaction P-values and amyloid-stratified analyses are provided in Supplementary Table 5. We found no difference in nEV protein level according to amyloid status (Supplementary Fig. 5). Post-hoc analyses found APOE ε4 genotype and diabetes status did not significantly modify the relationship between ISP composite score and MRI measures. However, stratified analyses suggest that having diabetes attenuates the association between insulin signaling and reduced WMH volume (Supplementary Table 6).

4. Discussion

Results from the current study suggest that among non-demented older adults, higher levels of EV-derived neuronal insulin signaling phospho-proteins (suggestive of enhanced insulin signaling) are associated with greater temporal lobe volume and lower WMH volume. We found that these associations are consistent at multiple biological levels of the insulin signaling cascade. Among individual phospho-proteins, the associations between p-GSK-3β with temporal lobe volume, and p-p70S6K with WMH volume were found to be (a) strongest and (b) statistically independent of other insulin signaling proteins, indicating that p-GSK-3β and p-p70S6K may be more directly involved in preserving aspects of brain health. The presence of cortical amyloid was associated with a significant attenuation in the relationship between greater insulin signaling protein levels and lower WMH volume. However, amyloid status did not modify other associations. Lastly, we found no associations between insulin signaling and total brain volume, hippocampal volume, or volume of brain regions outside of the temporal lobe, suggesting regional specificity of the insulin signaling-gray matter relationship.

Results from our primary analysis support the hypothesis that decreased levels of insulin signaling may accelerate regional atrophic changes and white damage in non-demented older adults. We previously found associations between nEV levels of p-Tyr-IRS-1 and pSer312-IRS-1 with volume of a temporoparietal cluster in individuals with AD (Mullins et al., 2017). However, to our knowledge, no previous study has examined the association between multiple in vivo measures of neuronal insulin signaling and MRI-defined measures of structural brain integrity in non-demented older adults or in a community sample of older adults. Consistent with the results of previous studies that used nEVs and neuropathological cohorts, we found evidence for neuroanatomical specificity of the insulin signaling-brain volume association (Moloney et al., 2010; Mullins et al., 2017). The specificity may reflect the neuroanatomical specificity of IRS-1 gene expression in the temporoparietal region, as has been demonstrated previously (Mullins et al., 2017). Importantly, the null associations with the AD Signature Region volume suggest that insulin resistance may not act as a driver of the early atrophic changes in other key brain regions vulnerable to AD pathology.

Our results indicate that the set of downstream protein kinases that are phosphorylated in the context of insulin signaling may mediate its effects on brain health. These molecules may regulate neuronal and glial viability through multiple pathways. For example, phospho-activation of Akt, which in turn activates p70S6K via the mTORC1 pathway, can lead to inhibition of apoptosis, increased cell growth and proliferation, and increased protein synthesis (Datta et al., 1999; Pei and Hugon, 2008). Thus, activation of this pathway in the brain may increase the survival of neural cells and protect against neurodegenerative processes. On the other hand, GSK-3β is constitutively active, but is rendered inactive following its phosphorylation by Akt. Given that active GSK-3β has been shown to promote the hyperphosphorylation of tau and pro-inflammatory signaling within the brain, it is hypothesized that phospho-inhibition of this protein via activation of the insulin signaling pathway is neuroprotective (Cai et al., 2012; Llorens-Martin et al., 2014; Schubert et al., 2004). Consistent with this hypothesis, it was recently shown that a decreased level of phosphorylated Akt, p70S6K, and GSK-3β are associated with worse performance on learning tasks among individuals with age-associated cognitive decline (Eren et al., 2020).

The current study builds on previous research by examining the effects of cortical amyloid on the relationship between insulin signaling and brain structure. Although this crosssectional study cannot establish causality, the results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of insulin signaling on white matter integrity may be attenuated in non-demented individuals who show elevations in cortical amyloid (i.e., individuals with preclinical and prodromal AD). Previous studies demonstrating a regulatory role of insulin signaling in oligodendrocyte survival and myelin production provide evidence for the importance of this pathway in ensuring cerebral white matter integrity (Wang et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2007). However, the neurotrophic effects of insulin signaling may be attenuated by Aβ oligomers, which are known to disrupt the insulin signaling pathway by inducing neuroinflammation and consequent inhibitory serine phosphorylation in IRS-1 (Supplementary Figure 6; Lourenco et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2009). Our findings suggest that these amyloid-induced changes may have particularly strong effects on the relationship between insulin signaling and the neurobiological processes maintaining white matter structural integrity, perhaps through p70S6K-mediated effects. A recent study which examined endothelial-derived EVs in MCI/mild AD patients and amyloid-negative controls found that the presence of WMH was associated with higher levels of glucose transporter type 1 (Glut-1) in both MCI/AD and Control individuals, and with higher levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in MCI/AD individuals (Abner et al., 2020). This study and the present study used different subpopulations of circulating EVs from cells on different sides of the blood-brain barrier, but the results collectively suggest a complex inter-relationship between Aβ pathology, glucose transport/insulin signaling, and the presence of microvascular brain disease.

The current study has several limitations that should be considered. First, although the levels of phosphorylated signaling mediators in neuronal-origin exosomes allow us to deduce the degree of insulin signaling that is likely present in their parent neuronal cells, we did not directly measure the net biologic effect of enhanced insulin signaling. Second, the results of this analysis were derived using a subset of participants in the ARIC-PET study from the Washington County site, which enrolled only white participants. Future work will be needed to determine whether the results of this analysis generalize to the broader population of older adults living within the US. Third, although standard deviation differences in insulin signaling protein levels were found to be comparable to 3-4 years of additional age in elderly persons, it is unclear if these differences in brain structure are clinically meaningful. Currently, the study is not powered to examine how nEV proteins relate to cognition. Studies with larger sample sizes are currently underway, which will help address these clinically relevant questions. Lastly, the current study may not be powered to detect modest associations, so non-significant associations, particularly from subgroup analyses, should be interpreted cautiously.

Despite these limitations, the current findings extend the understanding of how insulin signaling mediators previously implicated in AD pathogenesis relate to measures of brain structure in non-demented older adults. Specifically, we found in this community sample that neuronal proximal insulin signaling was associated with preserved white matter integrity and greater regional brain volume. From a therapeutic standpoint, the findings suggest that activation of the insulin signaling pathway in non-demented older adults may slow regional atrophic changes and limit white matter damage.

Highlights

Extracellular vesicles derived from neurons were isolated in plasma of older adults

Neuronal extracellular vesicle insulin signaling cascade proteins were quantified

Neuronal insulin signaling was associated with preserved regional brain volume

In absence of amyloid, neuronal insulin was associated with preserved white matter

Downstream protein kinases p70S6K and GSK-3β showed the most robust associations
