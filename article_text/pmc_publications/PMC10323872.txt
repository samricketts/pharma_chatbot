Aggregation and the formation of oligomeric intermediates of amyloid-β at the membrane interface of neuronal cells are implicated in the cellular toxicity and pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Small molecule compounds have been shown to suppress amyloid aggregation and cellular toxicity, but often the presence of lipid membrane negate their activity. A high throughput screen of 1,800 small molecules was performed to search for membrane active inhibitors and 21 primary hits were discovered. Through the use of fluorescence-based assays, transmission electron microscopy, and dot blot assays the initial 21 primary hits were narrowed down to 5 lead compounds. NMR and circular dichroism experiments were used for further confirmation of amyloid inhibition at the membrane interface and to obtain insights into the secondary structure of amyloid-β, while size exclusion chromatography was used to characterize the size of Aβ species. Lastly, dye leakage assays allowed for understanding as to how the addition of the 5 lead compounds affected amyloid-β’s ability to permeate the lipid bilayer. These results provide insights into small molecules that stabilize small amyloid species in the presence of membranes for the development of tool compounds for deeper investigations of these transient species.

Graphical Abstract


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a deadly and debilitating ailment that currently affects 50 million people worldwide.1 Early research into AD focused on the presence of indicative amyloid-beta (Aβ) fibrils due to their prominence in postmortem examination of patients’ brains. However, it is now hypothesized that small, toxic, intermediate species, known as oligomers, are the predominant toxic amyloid-beta (Aβ40) species in AD.2 Aβ peptides are produced from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the extracellular membrane by β and γ-secretases. Cellular membranes have been implicated to be a site of potential toxicity and can act as a catalyst for amyloid aggregation.3 Some oligomers are proposed to impart their toxic function by interacting directly with the cell membrane of neurons then disrupting and permeabilizing the membrane. As a result, non-selective ion channels and large pores are created which, in turn, ablate the charge gradient necessary for neuronal function.4 Many studies suggest that lipid membranes are able to accelerate their aggregation as well as facilitate the formation of unique structures of Aβ species that are specific to lipid bilayer disruption.5–10

There has been extensive investigation into small molecules with the ability to modulate the aggregation of Aβ in solution.11–23 However, the search for modulators of Aβ aggregation has relied on serendipity; often times, a novel class of inhibitors is accidentally discovered, and improved analogs are subsequently synthesized.14,24–26 Relying on accidental discoveries is unlikely to generate a diverse enough chemical portfolio to successfully generate a drug candidate that can demonstrate clinical efficacy. Thus, it is essential to identify new and novel chemical species which may be specifically capable of modulating membrane-assisted Aβ40 aggregation for use as toxic Aβ oligomer probes.2 Here, through the usage of a small molecule library, 5 compounds have been identified that modulate the formation of Aβ40 aggregates in the presence of lipid membrane. These small molecules represent an avenue for the development and further investigation of Aβ40 and membrane interactions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Using a library of over 1,800 compounds, selected for their chemical diversity and biological activity, the screening was performed by the addition of Aβ40 in the presence of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of a mixture of 7:3 molar ratio of DOPC:DOPG, which represents the charge distribution of eukaryotic membranes (Figure 1A). To probe the interactions between the lipid bilayer, small molecules, and Aβ40, we used a fluorescence readout assay regularly employed in amyloid studies using Thioflavin-T (ThT) dye. ThT assays provide insights into the kinetics of amyloid formation, which facilitates the identification of compounds that are able to inhibit the formation of β-sheet rich amyloid aggregates. Signal intensity can be proportional to the fibers present and decreases in intensity can be indicative of a decrease in overall fiber content (Figure S1). We optimized screening conditions, achieving a Z-score of 0.46 (Figure 1C). 40 reproducible hits were selected after ruling out fluorescent compounds and compounds which did not give a matching read-out in twin sets of plates. These 40 compounds were then used for a concentration response curve (CRC) titration screen to determine the activity of the compounds in a range of concentrations (Figures S2 and S3). Results from the CRC screen helped us to narrow down the 40 initial hits to 21 primary hits based on the calculated IC50 values and the exclusion of known compounds with PAINS properties (Figure 2, Tables S1, S2, and S3).27,28 Structural similarities exist among the 21 hit compounds. Many are heterocyclic, planar and contain functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding, properties which have been identified to be important in amyloid modulation. The names of the compounds are abbreviated for ease with the presentation in this publication based on the similarities and functional groups: Anthroquinone/naphthoquinone (AQ), benzendiols (BD), benzofuran (BF) Tetrahydroquinoline (THQ), thiourea (TU), and dihydroquinazolin (DHQ). While some of these small molecule compounds have been reported as inhibitors of other amyloid peptides previously, none have been identified to inhibit membrane-associated aggregation.

The selected 21 compounds were first subjected to full ThT kinetic profiles with measurements taken every 5 minutes (Figure 3). Each compound was tested at 10, 5 and 2 molar equivalents with respect to the concentration of Aβ40 while in the presence of 500 μM LUVs. Initially by the ThT assay, many appear to be promising and robust inhibitors, with many compounds negating the aggregation fully at all the concentrations tested. Some interesting kinetic traces were also observed for the following compounds that didn’t inhibit fully: THQ-1, THQ-3, TU-1, DHQ-2 and BF-4. THQ-3 and BF-4 extended the lag-time at higher concentrations, indicating changes in the primary nucleation steps. TU-1 and DHQ-2 showed a decrease in the final fluorescence intensity but the lag-time remained the same, pointing to a change in secondary nucleation. THQ-1 demonstrated interesting kinetics with an increase and decrease in intensity. This unusual kinetics observed could indicate that THQ-1 has preferential interactions with amyloid fibers, acting like a disaggregator, or that the structure of the aggregates is ThT active but then evolves into something that is no longer able to bind to ThT.

However, as critical as the ThT assay is to studying amyloid aggregation, it is also subject to fluorescent quenching, overlap, or displacement by other compounds. Because of this, secondary confirmation not relying on ThT fluorescence was performed to further narrow down the hit compounds. To do this we used the dot blot assay utilizing the OC anti-amyloid fiber antibody, which is known to bind to the general amyloid fiber β-sheet epitope (Figures 4 and S4).29 While many of the compounds looked to be complete inhibitors by the ThT assay, the strong antibody reactivity observed for Aβ40 in the presence of 7 out of the 21 compounds indicated that they do not inhibit the fiber formation. After identifying compounds that interfere with ThT fluorescence, we then examined the compounds that gave 50% or less reactivity by the dot blot assay by examining them via Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (Figure 5). We also selected a single compound, BD-3, to validate that the OC antibody did not give a false positive response and saw fibers on the grid. Out of the 15 compounds investigated, 5 of them inhibited Aβ40 fiber formation. Thus, the 5 compounds AQ-4, THQ-1, BF-3, DHQ-1 and DHQ-2, were selected for a deeper investigation. THQ-1, DHQ-1 and BF-3 were more uniform in the appearance of Aβ40 aggregates, whereas DHQ-2 and AQ-4 resulted in amorphous Aβ40 aggregates. Of the other 9 compounds that had fiber formation identified at this stage, many of them exhibited very interesting and distinct fiber morphologies, which could be of interest for further investigation, as some of them have been reported to be amyloid inhibitors in the absence of membrane.30,31 Some of these compounds appeared to produce Aβ40 fibers that were unbranched and highly uniform (AQ-1, AQ-2, AQ-7, and BD-1), while other compounds showed less ordered Aβ40 morphologies, with attributes such as branching or amorphous aggregates attached to the outside of fibers (THQ-2, AQ-3, BD-2, and BF-2). Detailed investigations into the structures of these aggregates may prove to be fruitful in understanding both the binding selectivity of ThT and the OC antibody, since these 9 compounds resulted in Aβ40 fiber structures that are invisible to both of these techniques described above.

Understanding the secondary structure transitions of Aβ40 is important for amyloid investigation, as there is a known shift from a random-coil monomer to β-sheet fiber. To study the effects of these small molecule compounds on the structure of Aβ, each of the 5 non-water-soluble compounds was incorporated in the lipid bilayer, which was confirmed by UV-Vis experiments (Figure S5). Upon incorporation of the compounds in the LUVs at a 10:1 lipid to compound molar ratio, we monitored the structural transitions of Aβ peptide using circular dichroism (CD) experiments as well as by ThT fluorescence based kinetics experiments (Figures 6 and S6). After 22 hours, Aβ still exhibited a random-coil structure in the presence of AQ-4, and a β-sheet conformation was observed in the presence of DHQ-1. On the other hand, in the presence of DHQ-2 or THQ-1 a slight shift in the negative peak to higher wavelength indicating a transition from the initial random-coil structure was observed. Similar trend was also observed in the presence of BF-3, but it is less pronounced. It is possible that Aβ is adopting a minor helical conformation, in the presence of these compounds (DHQ-2, THQ-1 and BF-3), as indicated by the shift towards 208 nm; another possibility is the formation of a polyproline II helix structure.32–34 While it is difficult to resolve and quantify the different secondary structures in these samples, the CD spectra clearly indicate the structural transitions from the initial random-coil structure to a mixture of secondary structures. Aβ maintained a random-coil conformation up to 7 days in the presence of AQ-4, whereas in the presence of BF-3, DHQ-1, and DHQ-2 a β-sheet conformation was observed after 48 hours. In the presence of THQ-1, however, a slight β-sheet characteristic for Aβ was observed but it was not fully interpretable at 48 hours due to a weak signal while it appeared more clearly β-sheet after 7 days.

Using NMR, we investigated the interaction of Aβ40 with each the 5 compounds both with and without the presence of loaded LUVs using SOFAST-HMQC experiments (Figures 7 and S7). This experiment is useful in determining the level of peptide aggregation (or monomer depletion) in solution.35 Because large aggregates such as amyloid fibers tumble slowly on the NMR timescale, they do not contribute to the observed signal in solution NMR spectroscopy and therefore any observed signal is conferred to be fast-tumbling oligomers or monomers.36 The signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, volume and line width of each peak were analyzed (Figures 7 and S7). In the presence of LUVs, Aβ40 showed 21 well-resolved peaks at time zero. After 24 hours, many of the peaks remained visible, but with decreased S/N ratios, indicating a depletion of monomers in solution via aggregation or binding to LUVs. Many of the peaks also broadened at 24 hours, which is another sign of peptide aggregation in the presence of lipid vesicles. At 96 hours, almost all peaks became invisible on the NMR spectra and with a very poor S/N ratio. For Aβ samples containing any of the 5 compounds (AQ-4, THQ-1, BF-3, DHQ-1 or DHQ-2), NMR spectra showed resonances very similar to that of the control Aβ40 sample (i.e., Aβ40+LUVs), however a poor S/N spectrum was observed in the presence of THQ-1. After 24 hours a decrease in signal-to noise ratio was observed for all the 5 samples, but notably the sample containing THQ-1 had no detectable signals in the spectrum. After 96 hours, DHQ-1 DHQ-2 and AQ-4 still maintained good S/N ratio in comparison to 0 hour and 24-hour time points. In the presence of BF-3, the S/N ratio continued to decrease at 96 hours indicating the Aβ40 in this sample had the highest degree of aggregated among all the samples, or had the greatest amount of peptides bound to LUVs, and no longer was tumbling fast in the NMR time scale. The AQ-4 containing sample showed a significant increase in linewidth after at 24 and 96 hours in comparison to the control sample. The BF-3 containing sample also showed an increase in linewidth at 24 hours, but then decreased below that observed for the control after 96 hours. The DHQ-1 or DHQ-2 containing sample showed minor changes in linewidth but overall maintained the same linewidths at all time points. It is also probable that some of the signal loss and changes in linewidth could be due to the binding of Aβ40 to 100 nm LUVs. This binding could cause the loss in signal intensity due to the decreased tumbling rate of the very large LUV. Investigations utilizing smaller membrane mimetics such as nanodiscs and implementing paramagnetic quenching could be an enlightening next step to understand these systems.

ThT fluorescence and NMR experiments in the absence of LUVs were also performed in order to investigate the interaction of a compound with Aβ40 itself (Figures S8–S10). After 96 hours, the control sample of Aβ40 alone exhibited a very poor S/N ratio, and only residue V39 was visible. For the sample with THQ-1, well resolved peaks from Aβ40 were seen at all time points, opposite of what was seen with LUVs. This indicates that THQ-1 interacts and inhibits Aβ40 aggregation but does not interact well in the presence of lipids, at least when loaded with lipids, since it appeared to be a strong inhibitor in the assays prior to loading the compounds in LUVs. Samples of Aβ40 with AQ-4, DHQ-1 or DHQ-2 showed a decreased S/N ratio (and peak volume) after 96 hours in comparison to the samples containing LUVs. The NMR spectrum of Aβ40 sample with BF-3 remained comparable to that observed for the sample containing LUVs in S/N ratio and peak volume. All 5 samples (each containing one of the 5 compounds) showed an increase in linewidths after 96 hours indicative of slower tumbling of the peptide due to binding via peptide-peptide or the peptide-ligand interactions.

After NMR measurements, the samples in presence of lipids were analyzed using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) (Figures 8 and S11). Three distinct peak areas were observed and the area under each curve was quantified to determine the distribution of aggregates within the sample. Peak-area-1 (between 5 and 8 mL) consisted of multiple peaks most likely made up of LUVs and Aβ40 amyloid fibers (absorbance at 214 nm). Peak-area-2 (15 mL) most possibly corresponds to an oligomer of 4 monomers (~17 kDa) or an oligomer of 3 monomers with each bound to 2 compounds (~16 kDa). Lastly, Peak-area-3 could correspond to monomers and dimers of Aβ40, eluting at 21.5 and 20 mL respectively. Since, these samples contain lipids, it is possible that a portion of the intensity of the peaks is also from lipids that are dissociated from LUVs.

For AQ-4, DHQ-1 and BF-3, over 50% of the eluted sample was either in peak-area 2 or 3, indicating the presence of a small amount of fibers and a larger proportion of smaller species. While the control sample, THQ-1, and DHQ-2 samples had 60% or more of the total signal in peak-area-1 corresponding to larger aggregates. The control sample showed no signal inside of peak-area-2, however, there was an additional small peak seen at 11 mL which could indicate a very large oligomer or protofibers not observed for other samples. Inside peak-area-1, two distinct peaks were observed: one for LUVs at 7.5 mL, and one for fibers at 6.5 mL. In between these two peaks, there is also a less resolved peak that may be from Aβ40 bound to LUVs, which is well resolved for the control sample of Aβ40 in LUVs, but can be seen more distinctly for other samples (AQ-4, DHQ-1, DHQ-2 and THQ-1). For the control LUVs sample, a small percentage of the total sample eluted in peak-area-3 which could correspond to small lipid aggregates/micelles. This could indicate that some of the signal in the other samples may also contain micelles or lipids that have been dissociated from the bilayer as the result of the peptide aggregation on the membrane.

Since Aβ40 has been shown to cause pore formation and fragmentation of the lipid bilayer, it is useful to know if the compounds change this proposed mechanism of toxicity.5,37–39 To investigate how the incorporation of the compounds changes the interaction of the peptide with the lipid bilayer, we performed a dye-leakage assay using lipid vesicles loaded with the 5 compounds filled with 6-carboxyfluroescien (Figure 9). As previously seen, Aβ40 caused a significant dye-leakage (50%) of vesicles composed of 7:3 DOPC:DOPG lipids, indicating that the peptide is disrupting the lipid bilayer during its aggregation. It is interesting to note that the lag-time of the dye-leakage is longer than that of the ThT assays of the loaded vesicles (Figure S6). This extended lag-time may indicate the importance of the fiber mediated fragmentation of the vesicles. Loaded vesicles with any of the 5 compounds caused less dye-leakage than the control. DHQ-1, DHQ-2 and THQ-1 all showed final dye-leakage intensities around 15%, indicating a partial blockage of membrane disruption by Aβ40. AQ-4 showed a very little dye-leakage, while BF-3 showed the most. For BF-3 loaded vesicles, the final dye-leakage intensity was found to be almost 30% double the dye-leakage of the other inhibitors. The lag-time of the dye-leakage is also extended in comparison to the control in which the control exhibited ~5 hours and the BF-3 loaded vesicles exhibited ~15 hours. These findings are quite fascinating when in conjunction with all the other biophysical data. Additional experiments will be carried out to further investigate the effect of ligands on the pore-forming mechanism of amyloid-beta and other amyloid peptides.

CONCLUSIONS

The interactions of Aβ with lipid membrane have been heavily explored via both experimental and molecular dynamics simulations.6,33,40 These investigations have led to hypothesis as to how exactly these interactions take place and have concluded that Aβ can act in mechanisms of membrane disruption such as pore formation, and carpeting followed by a “detergent like” disruption. Although these detailed molecular events underlying the membrane disruption process have been valuable, they have remained elusive for further experimental studies. Here, we have demonstrated the idea of using small molecule tools as a method to investigate these transient molecular interactions to better understand the molecular events underlying the membrane-catalyzed amyloid-beta aggregation which result in membrane disruption.

A high-throughput screen has led to the identification of 5 membrane active Aβ40 amyloid inhibitors as briefly summarized in Table 1. Among them DHQ-2 and THQ-1 were found to be less robust, whereas AQ-4, BF-3, and DHQ-1 exhibited the most evidence that they are able to stop the aggregation (or trap the aggregates) in the presence of a lipid membrane. AQ-4 showed the highest ratio of oligomers by SEC, a constant random-coil signal from CD, as well as maintaining good NMR signal intensity in samples with and without the lipid membrane. This could indicate that even though AQ-4 interacts with the membrane, it is also able to directly interact with Aβ40. In addition, the least amount of dye-leakage was observed in the presence of AQ-4. Perhaps this is due to the fact that Aβ40 seems to maintain its random-coil structure, and it could be possible that while it is interacting with the membrane surface, it may not able to penetrate the bilayer because of its secondary structure. This data provides evidence that AQ-4 may be acting as a small molecule trap for the first steps in Aβ40 association with the membrane in a “carpet” like mechanism and that Aβ40 is halted from proceeding to the next step in the membrane disruption process.

BF-3 also exhibited no Aβ40 aggregation by ThT and induced a mix of structures at 22 hours before becoming beta-sheet at 48 hours. BF-3 induced an overall loss in NMR intensity for every residue, which was less pronounced in the samples lacking membrane. The presence of BF-3 particularly induced the most amount of dye leakage and showed an extension in the leakage lag time. These observations indicate that while BF-3 stops Aβ40 fiber formation, it still allows the evolvement of structures upon peptide interaction with membrane; this could indicate that BF-3 is trapping a later step in the membrane disruption process such as pore formation most likely via a beta-sheet oligomer.

DHQ-1 induced complete amyloid inhibition, and the earliest and most pronounced beta-sheet conformation, and also maintained a high S/N ratio in the NMR spectra. It allowed for 15% dye leakage with no apparent lag time, and the dye leakage began around the same time as the control. These observations indicate that DHQ-1 could be trapping the very first steps in membrane disruption such as small calcium selective pore formation while preventing the next and more membrane damaging steps to occur as observed for BF-3.5,41

DHQ-2 induced a mixture of confirmations for Aβ at the 22-hour time point but went on to form a beta-sheet structure after 48 hours. The observation of a lack of complete ThT suppression, the largest proportion of Aβ40 in peak-area-1 in SEC, only ~15% dye leakage, and a consistency in maintaining NMR signal intensity with or without membrane indicate that a large portion of Aβ40 populations is small size oligomeric aggregates in the presence of DHQ-2. Although DHQ-1 and DHQ-2 showed some differences in activity, they may be a good starting point for developing derivatives. Given their similar architecture and sites for potential synthesis, they could be used in an interesting study to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis.

THQ-1 exhibited many similarities to that observed for DHQ-2 from CD, ThT and SEC; but resulted in very poor NMR S/N ratios in the presence of membrane from the start and signal was undetectable at 24 and 96 hours, while the opposite was true in the absence of membranes. A possible explanation for this difference could be that THQ-1 has a strong affinity for incorporating into the lipid bilayer and could alter the membrane to act as an improved site for nucleation and be acting as a promoter of non-fiber aggregate formation for Aβ40. This possibility is supported by the fact that THQ-1 shows efficient membrane incorporation by UV-Vis, which would leave very little free THQ-1 to directly interact with Aβ40 for an inhibition mechanism. On the other hand, THQ-1 showed efficient amyloid inhibition in the absence of membrane.

The final five structures identified here have many similarities in chemistry including fused rings, hydrogen bonding sites and lack of free rotation among some of the aromatic groups. However, many compounds initially investigated as part of the 21 primary hits also had this feature but resulted in prominent Aβ40 fibers; so clearly there must be unique properties possessed by these compounds and their interplay between Aβ40 and the membrane which render their inhibitory activities. It would be an interesting avenue to explore with machine learning to obtain useful insights as to what molecular features made these compounds unique to be Aβ40 inhibitors in the presence of membrane, and could be a starting point for similar screens in silico to explore a broader chemical space.42 With the presented data as a starting point, NMR and MD simulations would be a robust tool to investigate the structure of Aβ40 in the presence of the identified compounds as well as achieve high resolution structures of Aβ40 in conjunction with the membrane. Such studies could pave ways for the development of potential compounds to alter the toxicity of Aβ40 and the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS.

Screening Protocol:

A library of 1,800 compounds were selected based on their chemical diversity and known biological activities from Pilot Prestwick, Navigator Pathways and Maybridge libraries from the Center of Chemical Genomics (CCG) from the University of Michigan High Throughput Screening core facility. Thioflavin-T was selected as the primary read out for the screen and was used at 20 μM final concentration. All reagents were kept on ice until dispensing onto the plate. The screening was performed using Aβ40 expressed in E.coli and purified as described elsewhere43 and was used at a final concentration of 10 μM. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of a 7:3 mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1’-rac-glycerol) (DOPG) were prepared from chloroform stocks and made into lipid films by evaporating chloroform under nitrogen gas and then by lyophilization. Films were then rehydrated into buffer and then extruded to a size of 100 nm and were used at a final concentration of 500 μM. lipids and extruder were purchased from Avanti polar lipids. A buffer of 20 mM phosphate containing 50 mM NaCl at pH 7.4 was used in all experiments. The assay was performed in 384 polystyrene plates from corning (product number 3640) with a non-binding surface. Each well was equipped with a single 0.5 mm sterile glass bead that will be added using a custom made bead dispenser from LabTIE, in order to act as a miniature stir rod to overcome the surface tension to ensure sufficient mixing during shaking.44 Buffer was initially loaded into plates at a volume of 15 μL before adding the compounds dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 100 μM using a Biomek FX liquid handling automatic workstation. The remaining buffer, ThT, LUVs and Aβ40 were added using Plates Thermo Fischer Mutli Drop Combi to a final volume of 30 μL and then sealed. Initial fluoresce readings were done from each plate at 440ex/480em using a Perkin Elmer 2014 Envision Multilabel plate reader on bottom read setting. After the initial reading, plates were moved to a multiplate shaker kept inside an incubator set at 37 °C and were shaken for 24 hours at 750 rpm. After 24 hours of heating and shaking the plates fluorescence intensity was measured again. Each compound was added to duplicate plates in order to rule out false positives and to overcome the reproducibility issues among wells often seen with amyloid aggregation assays. After initial hits were identified, the top 40 hits were validated via the same protocol as described; however, the compounds were titrated at 8 concentrations between 2–100 μM using TTP Labtech’s Mosquito nanoliter hit picking system. From the concentration response curves (CRC) 21 compounds were selected based on the generated IC50 values and as well as removing compounds known to be pan assay interreference compounds (PAINS), which are compounds known to interfere with biological assays and commonly produce false positive hits.28 IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism by fitting the concentration of compound vs normalized fluorescent intensity to a nonlinear fit using a predefined equation titled ‘[inhibitor] vs. normalized response with variable slope’ with least squares regression (Table S3). After the 21 compounds were selected, fresh compounds were bought from manufactures as shown in Table S1 and dissolved in DMSO. Full kinetic ThT profiles were obtained for each compound at 100, 50 and 20 μM concentrations. Reagents were prepared in the same manner as done in the screen but with using multichannel pipettes in place of robotic handling. Samples were plated in quadruplicates on 384 well plates with the temperature maintained at 37 °C under slow and continuous orbital shaking. Fluorescence readings were obtained from a Biotek Synergy 2 microplate reader and were measured from the bottom with an excitation wavelength of 440 nm (30 nm bandwidth) and an emission wavelength of 485 nm (20 nm bandwidth) at three-minute intervals.

Dot Blot Assay:

2 μL from the 50 μM compound containing ThT assay wells were spotted onto the nitrocellulose membrane in duplicate. Wells containing only compound and the LUVs were also spotted for control. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by soaking in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 30 min at RT. The primary Anti-Amyloid Fibrils OC Antibody at a 1:2000 dilution in 5% BSA in TBS-T for 30 min at RT. The membrane was washed with TBS-T (3 × 5 min). Rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution was incubated for 30 min at RT. The membrane was washed with TBS-T (1 × 15 min and 2 × 5 min), and then incubated with ECL reagent for 1 min and sealed. Immediately after ECL reagent incubation, membranes were exposed using X-ray film in a dark room for 30 seconds. Images and intensities of spots were processed using ImageJ software.

Transmission Electron Microscopy:

Samples used in TEM analysis were taken directly from ThT experiments on the wells of 5 equivalents of compound after 24h incubation. Glow discharged grids (Formar/carbon 200 mesh, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, U.S.A.) were treated with samples (7 μL) for 2 min at room temperature. Excess buffer was removed through blotting and then washed three times with ddH2O. Then the grids were incubated with uranyl acetate staining solution (1% w/v in ddH2O, 7 μL) for about 1 min, and the excess stain was blotted away. Images from each sample were obtained using a JEOL 1400-plus TEM (80 kV) at varying magnifications.

Small molecule incorporation into lipids:

The 5 compounds were dissolved into chloroform stocks and then added to lipid mixtures in chloroform at a 10:1 lipid to compound molar ratio. The lipid films were made as described above for final concentrations of 50 μM compound within 500 μM lipids. Compounds containing LUVs were extruded and then checked for incorporation using UV-Vis measurements. Extruded solutions appeared clear and maintained clarity for up to 7 days on the bench top.

Circular Dichroism:

Single point CD measurements were carried out at 25 μM Aβ40 concentration in the presence of 500 μM lipids loaded with 50 μM of compound. CD experiments were performed using a JASCO J- 1500 CD spectrometer with a 0.1 cm path-length cell. CD spectra were obtained at 25 °C using a 2 nm bandwidth, a scan rate of 200 nm/min, and averaging spectra over 10 scans with a smoothing factor of 13. Measurements were taken immediately after mixing the sample (t = 0 h) and after various time points.

NMR experiments:

2D 1H/15N SOFAST-HMQC NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 800 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5mm triple-resonance inverse detection TCI cryoprobe. NMR samples were prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer with 50 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) containing 10% D2O at 298.2 K. Freshly dissolved 15N-labeled Aβ40 was mixed with liposomes containing 500 μM of lipids and 50 μM of incorporated compound, as well as in the absence of lipids with the compounds dissolved in deuterated DMSO at 50 μM. All NMR samples were stored at 37 °C during the time-lapse measurements. Each 2D NMR spectrum was acquired using 256 t1 increments, 16 scans, 16 dummy scans and a recycle delay of 0.2s. NMR data were processed using TopSpin 3.5 (Bruker) and analyzed using Sparky 3.114.

Size Exclusion Chromatography:

NMR samples were used for SEC characterization. 200 μL of each sample was loaded using Superdex 75 Increase LS Tricorn 10/300 column operated on an AKTA purifier (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) read at 214 nm with a flow rate of 1mL/min.

Dye Leakage assay:

Lipids and the 5 small molecules in chloroform were placed in vials at the desired ratios and solvent was evaporated with N2 gas. Films were hydrated with 50 mM 6-carboxyfluorescein dye and put through no less than five freeze-thaw cycles. Following this, these samples were extruded through a 100 nm pore membrane no less than 21 times and filtered through a disposable PD-10 desalting column to separate dye filled vesicles from free 6-carboxyfluorescein in solution. The first 3.5 mL of eluate from the column were discarded and the following 1.5 mL of eluate of dye filled vesicles was collected. DLS was checked for to ensure 100 nm LUVs present in fractions. LUVs were diluted into buffer and then used for dye leakage assays on a 96 well plate in 20 mM phosphate (containing 50 mM NaCl) buffer at 37 °C with slow shaking over 40 hours in the presence of freshly prepared 10 μM Aβ40 Percentage of dye released was determined after LUV lysis with triton-X and calculated as previously described.5
