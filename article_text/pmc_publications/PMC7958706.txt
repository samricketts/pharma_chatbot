Elevated levels of cellular cholesterol have been identified as one factor contributing to the onset of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Specific interaction between cholesterol and the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), investigated via NMR experiments and computational stusdies, has been proposed to play a critical role in the processing of APP by secretases and the biogenesis of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein. We present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 40-residue congener of the C-terminal domain of APP, C9916–55 (C99), in cholesterol-enriched DMPC lipid bilayers. We investigated the effect of cholesterol concentration on the conformational ensemble of wildtype C99 and C99-cholesterol associations at the low pH of endosomal environments, at which residues E22 and D23 are neutral. C99 was also characterized in liquid ordered domains for Dutch (E22Q) and Iowa (D23N) Familial Alzheimer’s Disease mutants at low pH and for the wildtype sequence using protonation states characteristic of neutral pH. Our results reproduce the equilibrium constant of past NMR characterizations of the C99-cholesterol interaction, but are not consistent with the C99-cholesterol binding hypothesis. We find that the lifetimes of both DMPC and cholesterol complexed with C99 display a power-law distribution of residence lifetimes. Longer-lived C99-DMPC and C99-cholesterol complexes are primarily stabilized by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds of lysine amines to phosphate and hydroxyl groups. Nevertheless, specific interfaces for C99-cholesterol association which are not present for DMPC can be identified. Changes to C99-cholesterol interfaces are found to depend on C99 tilt angle and orientation of the juxtamembrane domain of C99 containing residues E22 and D23. These observations support a more nuanced view of C99-cholesterol interaction than has previously been suggested. We propose that cholesterol modulates the conformation and activity of C99 and other small transmembrane proteins indirectly through induction of the liquid ordered phase and directly through hydrogen bonding. This suggests a critical role for membrane heterogeneity introduced by cholesterol in modulating the structural ensemble of C99 and the production of Aβ.

Graphical Abstract


INTRODUCTION

The onset of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has long been correlated with enhanced levels of cholesterol resulting from diet, genetic predisposition, or aging.1-8 Evidence suggests enhancement of cellular cholesterol concentration upregulates the amyloid cascade pathway,3,9 by which Amyloid Precursor Protien (APP) is processively cleaved of β- and γ-secretase to produce Aβ peptides of various lengths.10-14 The Aβ42 and Aβ43 isoforms are of principal importance to the formation of Aβ oligomers and fibrils. Aggregates enriched in these isoforms are implicated with the onset of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) via the amyloid cascade hypothesis.13

β-secretase is evidenced to cleave APP in the lipid rafts9,15,16 of endosomes from the trans-Golgi network and the plasma membrane17-19 to produce C99. γ-secretase is also evidenced to reside in lipid rafts of these same cellular compartments where it processes C99 to form various isomers of Aβ.9,15,16 As such, lipid rafts are central to the production of both C99 from APP and Aβ from C99. Lipid rafts are domains in lipid membranes characterized by the liquid ordered (Lo) thermodynamic phase, which is more dense and ordered than the liquid disordered (Ld) phase that characterizes the bulk membrane.

Lipid raft domains are predominantly distinguished by their high but widely varying concentrations of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and gangliosides. However, the membrane Lo phase itself can be most simply modeled as a binary mixture consisting of cholesterol and a lipid with two saturated tails. Within such binary lipid bilayers, the Ld to Lo phase transition occurs continuously as cholesterol concentration increases from 0 to 20 mol%.20-24 When cellular cholesterol levels are low, lipid rafts cannot form APP-β-secretase associations supported by lipid rafts. Instead, APP preferentially associates with and is processed by α-secretase, producing the non-amyloidogenic C83, ending the amyloid cascade.25

In addition to cholesterol’s role in lipid raft formation, cholesterol has been proposed to modulate C99 conformation through a C99-cholesterol complex. The C99-cholesterol complex was first suggested by Sanders and coworkers based on observations of shifts in the 1H-15N 2D NMR spectra of C99 as a function of the concentration of cholesterol analog β-CHOLBIMALT in LMPG micelles.26,27 Subsequent experiments by Barrett et al.28 in DMPC:DHPC bicelles led to the proposal that C99 binds to cholesterol (Chol) via the glycine-rich face of the N-terminal region of the transmembrane domain (TMD). The same glycine-rich face plays a role in stabilizing C99 homodimers.29-31 It was further proposed that the binding site is completed by formation of a short reentrant juxtamembrane (JM) helix. Further studies by Song et al. characterized the equilibrium constant of C99-Chol association, KdC99−Chol, in POPC:POPG lipid vesicles as 2.7 ± 0.3 mol% (−2.1 kcal/mol) via fitting changes in chemical shift as a function of protein and cholesterol concentration to a phenomenological kinetic model.32 The observed association is weaker than typical protein backbone-water hydrogen bonds (H-bonds).33

The TMD of C99 (G29AIIGLMVGGVVIATVIVITLVMLKKK55) contains several sequence motifs known to stabilize canonical “GASright” homodimers, including G29xxxG33xxxG37 (a glycine zipper) and G38xxxA42.34-36 Sanders has proposed that the glycine zipper provides a “groove” that supports contacts between the C99 TMD and the smooth α-face of Chol.27 All-atom MD simulations of the C99 TMD in DMPC:Chol bilayers, employing initial conditions in which the Chol α-face is in contact with the G29xxxG33 face of C99 (Figure 1.A-C), estimated the C99-Chol binding energy to be −2.6 ± 0.4 kcal/mol.37 A subsequent simulation study observed the pKa of E22 and E23 of the C99 JM domain (K16LVFFAED23), having pKas of 7.4 ± 0.1 and 6.5 ± 0.1, must be protonated to stabilize the JM helix and Chol interactions.38 The JM domain helix can be destabilized when both E22 and D23 are protonated (neutralized), at pH 7. As such, the structure and function of the JM helix is different at the cytosolic pH of 7 experienced in plasma membranes and the luminal pH of 4.5 to 6.5 in endosomal membranes.39 E22 and D23 are also sites for Familial AD (FAD) mutations, including the Dutch (E22Q)40 and Iowa (D23N)41 mutants.

The potential interplay of C99 and cholesterol are often discussed in terms of a strong C99-Chol complex.42 The concept of a bound C99-Chol complex is surprising, as there is no precedent for cholesterol binding to other single-pass transmembrane proteins. Protein-cholesterol binding interfaces have been defined for multi-pass proteins such as G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels.43-54 These transmembrane interfaces have been characterized in terms of Cholesterol Recognition/interaction Amino acid Consensus (CRAC) sequences.55,56 CRAC domain sequences are (L/V)-X1–5-Y-X1–5-(K/R), in which X1–5 are any apolar amino acid. CARC (“inverse” CRAC) domains are (K/R)-X1–5-(Y/F)-X1–5-(L/V).57 Within these CRAC or CARC domains, the aromatic residues support Chol-protein π-stacking interactions with the Chol-α face assisted by van der Waals contacts with Leu or Val. These domains can also support H-bonding with Chol at the lipid-water interface with Arg or Lys. C99 contains one CARC sequence in the JM domain, K16LVFFAEDV24. Within this domain, the pH-switching residues E22 and D23 are present.

Barrett et al. studied C99 in DMPC:DHPC using 1H-15N NMR and observed chemical shifts that strongly (F20, E22, G29, I32, G33, V39) or moderately (D23, N27, L34MVGG38) respond to changes in Chol concentration.28 It was suggested that these residues may constitute the binding interface (Figure 1.C). However, the orientation of these residues around the helical TMD shows no particular face of C99 along which Chol would interact (Figure 1.D). Taken together, these observations suggest that the C99-Chol complex is only moderately stable and may be less specific than previously proposed.

MD simulations have been used to explore protein-Chol binding interfaces in GPCRs employing the MARTINI lipid and protein model to explore possible protein-Chol complexes.44-46,48-52 These coarse-grained simulations have led to the identification of contacts formed between multiple transmembrane helices. Putative protein-Chol binding complexes are mapped to all-atom models to elucidate their structure and specific stabilizing interactions. Given the lack of significant structural pockets, this approach cannot be used to propose binding sites for Chol to single pass transmembrane proteins such as C99. In addition, coarse-grained models lack detailed H-bonding and π-stacking interactions necessary to support stable C99-Chol complexes,58 making them unsuitable for the exploration of Chol-protein binding.

The minimal subsequence C9916–55, (K16LVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIATVIV-ITLVMLKKK55), appears to be required to capture essential interactions between C99 and cholesterol. This congener contains the ubiquitous VGSN turn sequence, the central hydrophobic cluster KLVFFAED,13,59 and the C99 TMD, including the K53K54K55 lysine anchor.30,60 For C99 in plasma membranes and micelles, experiment and simulation suggest that KLVFFAED will form a JM helix, that VGSNK forms a turn, and GAIIGLMVGGVVI-ATVIVITLVMLKKK forms the α-helical C99 TMD.26-28,58,60,61

In this study, we employ unbiased MD simulations, that make no prior assumption of the C99-Chol encounter complex, in order to characterize the nature of the C99-Chol interaction in DMPC bilayers containing 0, 5, 10, and 20 mol% Chol. Four forms of C99 were studied including (1) wildtype C9916–55 neutral E22, D23 or (2) charged E22, D23, and (3) the Dutch (E22Q)40 with neutral D23 and Q23, and (4) Iowa (D23N)41 mutant with neutral E22 and N23. We performed 70 unbiased, 1-μs all-atom simulations of C9916–55.

Enhancements to cholesterol concentration, introducing the Lo phase, change the structure of C99. We characterized the structure of C99 by TMD tilt, helical propensity, orientation of the JM domain, and height of the JM domain above the membrane surface. We also observed that the E22Q mutant, D23N mutant, and charge state of E22 and D23 in the Lo phase also change the structure of C99. C99-cholesterol residence lifetimes were found to be power-law distributed with constants k in the range of 1.21 to 1.43, suggesting heterogeneity in the stability of C99-Chol complexes. Of these, long-lived C99-Chol complexes were found to be supported by hydrogen bonds of K16 and K28 with the Chol hydroxyl group in the upper leaflet (exo-facing in plasma membrane), and K53-K55 with the Chol hydroxyl group in the lower leaflet (cyto-facing in plasma membrane). Within the upper leaflet, it was found that the conformation of the JM domain creates unique interfaces for C99-Chol complexes whose potential of mean force are within 1 kcal/mol of the KdC99−Chol determined by Song et al.32 We conclude that monomeric C99 does not bind Chol through the formation of a specific, stable heterodimer. We find that multiple, specific C99-Chol complexes can form pending the conformational state of the C99 JM domain and lipid phase.

METHODOLOGY

Molecular Dynamics Simulation

The 40-residue C9916–55 congener sequence was used to model C99. The CHARMM36 force field62,63 was employed to describe the system, using ACE N-terminal and CT3 C-terminal capping groups. C99 was initiated from a configuration based on PDB:2LOH.64 in which the JM domain is structured and inserted into the membrane obtained from past simulation of wildtype C99 in DMPC:Chol 8:2 simulations,38 Cholesterol was laterally distributed at random in the bilayer such that there was no C99-Chol dimer in the initial state. This is different from past work exploring the C99-Chol complex, in which the initial state was a preformed C99-Chol complex at the GxxxG interface.37,38 Lipid bilayers, each encapsulating the transmembrane domain of C99, were prepared in CHARMM using the CHARMM-GUI system building protocol.65-69

The bilayer leaflets were constructed with an asymmetric number of lipids in order to support the insertion of the JM domain to the upper leaflet of the lipid bilayer. For 0, 5, 10, and 20 mol% systems 69, 66, 62, and 55 DMPC were used in the upper leaflet and 73, 69, 65, and 58 DMPC were used in the lower leaflet. For 5, 10, and 20 mol% systems, 3, 7, 14 Chol were used in the upper leaflet and 4, 8, and 15 Chol were used in the lower leaflet. Approximately 46 waters per lipid and 17 Na+ and Cl− ions (with additional counter-ions depending on the system) were used to solvate each lipid bilayer. Four different C99 proteins were simulated, including (1) at an effectively acidic pH, in which E22 and D23 were neutral (E22,D23[0]),38 (2) at neutral pH (E22,D23[-]), as well as the (3) Dutch (E22Q[0]) and (4) Iowa (D23N[0]) FAD mutants at acidic pH. These acidic and neutral pH protonation states are representative of the endosomal and plasma membrane environments, respectively. Ten replicates of each of these proteins were prepared with unique, randomized lateral distributions of DMPC and Chol. Each system was minimized and then equilibrated using a processive release of restraints and associated increase from 1- to 2-fs integration time step as suggested by Wu et al.68

All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using 25 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2680v4 CPUs and a P100 GPU using GROMACS 2018.370 at mixed precision to achieve a 86 ns/day rate of sampling for these ~35,900-atom simulations. The leap-frog integrator was used at a 2-fs time step in combination with hydrogen bond constraints via the SETTLE method.71 Neighbor lists were updated every 20 steps using the buffered Verlet neighbor scheme. Short-range interactions employed a 1.2 nm distance cutoff with a force switching function applied from 1.0 to 1.2 nm for Lennard-Jones and from 0 to 1.2 nm for electrostatic interactions. Long-range interactions were handled using Particle Mesh Ewald72 with a 0.12 nm grid spacing and 4th order grid interpolation. A Nosé-Hoover thermostat73 with 1 thermostatting chain and a time constant of 1 ps was used to control temperature to 310 K, separating C99, the lipid bilayer, and the solvent to three separate thermostat groups. The Parrinello-Rahman barostat74 was used with the z-axis decoupled from the xy-plane employing a 5 ps time constant, a reference pressure of 1 bar, and a compressibility of 4.5x10−5 bar−1. Each system was run for 1 μs of MD, summing to 70 μs of sampling. Coordinates were saved every 100 ps. All analyses employed this frame-resolution, including 100,000 frames in the analysis of each system.

Protein Conformational Analysis

Various descriptions of the protein conformational ensemble were employed to characterize essential changes to C99 structure in these different conditions. To describe insertion of the JM domain to (or evacuation from) the membrane surface, we evaluated the difference of the z-axial positions of K16 Cα atoms from the mean z-axial positions of the phosphorous of DMPC within the upper leaflet of each frame. The tilt (polar) angle (θ) of the protein TMD was determined from the angle between a vector that best fit the heavy backbone atoms of C99 in residues 30-55 and the bulk membrane normal (the z-axis) (Figure 2.A). To describe the relative orientation of the JM domain to the GxxxG face, an azimuthal angle (φ) in the xy-plane was defined over 360°, in which 0° defines a perfect overlap of the JM domain and the GxxxG face. The director of the GxxxG face (G29AIIG33LMVG37) was defined by taking the centroid of the xy-positions of residues 31-35 as the tail, and the G33 Cα xy-position as the vector head. To define φ, a vector describing the JM domain was defined by determining a vector of best fit through heavy backbone atoms of residues 17-24 and enforcing the head to be at L17 and the tail to be at V24 (Figure 2.B). To characterize the helicity of C99, H-bonds were identified between amide of each ith residue and any of the i+3, i+4, or i+5 residue backbone oxygen atoms and counted towards a helix if present, using a 2.5 Å H-O distance criterion.

Protein-Cholesterol and Protein-DMPC Contact and Binding

To define the xy-plane distribution of upper-leaflet Chol or DMPC complexed with C99 relative to the GxxxG face, we rotated the coordinates of the system such that the xy-plane projection of the GxxxG face vector points along the positive x-axis, obtaining the position of solvating Chol or DMPC in these transformed x’ and y’ coordinates (Figure 2.C). To determine contacts between C99 and Chol or DMPC, we used a 5 Å distance cut-off between heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms to define whether a contact was formed. To more easily represent C99-Chol contacts, contacts of each heavy atom on Chol (of 28) with each protein residue (of 40) were averaged over geometrically-representative subunits of the Chol molecule, simplifying from 28 Chol contacts to 8. Subunits of Chol were assigned as O (O3) the oxygen head group, β (C18, C19) defining β-face methyl groups, the sterol rings A (C3, C2, C4, C1, C5, C6), B (C6, C10, C7, C9, C8), C (C9, C8, C11, C14, C12, C13), D (C14, C13, C15, C16, C17), and the upper and lower segments of the carbon tail, T1 (C20, C21, C22, C23) and T2 (C24, C25, C26, C27) (Figure 1.A). Similarly, to easily represent C99-DMPC contacts, the 46 heavy atoms of DMPC are averaged over the geometrically-representative subunits of DMPC, simplified from 46 to 5 contacts. Subunits of DMPC were assigned as N (C13, C14, C15, N, C12, C11), P (O12, O13, O14, P, O11, C1), C1 (C22, C23, C24, C25, C26, C32, C33, C34, C35, C36), C2 (C27, C28, C29, C210, C37, C38, C39, C310), and C3 (C211, C212, C213, C214, C311, C312, C313, C314) (Figure 1.B).

We tracked the “residence time” over which each Chol or DMPC remained in contact with C99. A 25-ns cutoff in residence time was used to distinguish complexed and transient Chol or DMPC upon inspection of residence time probability distributions (see Results). The number of Chol or DMPC simultaneously solvating C99 was determined by counting the number of intersecting residence times between solvating Chol or DMPC (with residence times &gt;25-ns) per frame in each simulation. This was done by first determining the number of n-mers of the highest order, progressively evaluating lower order n-mers down to a dimer, and removing frames found to intersect with other frames when determining the number of each n-mer present in the trajectory. This ensured that a given frame of a solvating Chol or DMPC could not be counted as part of both a higher- and lower-order n-mer. This analysis was performed in the upper and lower leaflets to quantify the number of simultaneously populated solvation sites of the C99 congener.

The angular distribution of the Chol mass density around the GxxxG face supported the definition of five unique C99-Chol interfaces in the upper leaflet (see Results). We determined the relative population and C99-Chol contacts for these five interfaces, defined based on the angular position around the GxxxG face vector. The interfaces labeled from 1 to 5 were assigned for Chol centers of mass at positions between 290-45°, 45-115°, 115-190°, 190-220°, and 220-290° relative to the GxxxG face vector. The relative orientation of these interfaces corresponds to the relative positioning of residues that exhibited strong or moderate changes in chemical shift as measured in past NMR studies of C99 (Figure 1.C) in DHPC:DMPC:Chol bicelles.28

We measured the hydrogen bonds formed for solvating C99 or DMPC involving Lys 16, 28, 53, 54, and 55. From Lys, the amide nitrogen, N, amido nitrogen, NZ, and, for Lys 55, the capping nitrogen, NT, serve as donors and the carbonyl O3 serves as an acceptor. From Chol, the hydroxyl group, H3 and O3, serves as donor and acceptor. From DMPC there are three groups of acceptors. From the phosphate there are O11, O12, O13, and O14. From the ester groups on the lipid tails there are O21 and O22, and O31 and O32. A hydrogen bond was defined if the H-O distance is under 2.5 Å and if the N-H-O angle is larger than 150°. The Lys-phosphate hydrogen bonds measured here are more appropriately described as a salt bridge due to its ionic character, and we refer to it as such in the manuscript.

RESULTS and DISCUSSION

All-atom MD simulations of C9916–55 employing neutral, protonated E22 and D23 corresponding to pH ≤ 6.538 pH were performed at 0, 5, 10, and 20 mol% cholesterol (Chol) in DMPC lipid bilayers mimicking experiments of Song et al.32 At 20 mol% Chol, simulations of C9916–55 at acidic pH (C99[E22,D23[0]]) and neutral pH (C99[E22,D23[-]]) were performed, along with simulations of the Dutch (C99[E22Q[0]]) and Iowa (C99[D23N[0]]) FAD mutants at acidic pH. These acidic and neutral protonation states mimic the endosomal and plasma membrane environments in which C99 is processed by γ-secretase to form amyloid beta (Aβ).17-19,39 Analysis of 10 1-μs replicates of each system was used to characterize the conformational ensembles of C99 and interfaces of long-lived C99-Chol complexes.

C99 conformational ensemble

Orientation of C99 domains depends on cholesterol concentration

At 0, 5, 10 and 20 mol% Chol, the bilayer is characterized as a miscible mixture of DMPC and Chol. In order to characterize the effect of varying Chol concentration and lipid ordering, we computed the C99 tilt angle (θ) distribution, relative orientation of the JM domain to the GxxxG face in the xy-plane (φ), the insertion depth of the JM domains to the membrane surface, and the helicity of C99 residues.

When the concentration of Chol is increased in saturated lipid bilayers the Lo phase formed.23 This manifests a commonly observed z-axial thickening and xy-plane condensation and ordering of lipids in the lipid bilayer that is expected to cause the C99 tilt angle (θ) to decrease. The C-H NMR order parameter was used to report on the enhancement in lipid tail ordering characteristic of the Lo phase, which we observe to be substantially enhanced by addition of Chol (Figure S1). What was not anticipated, was the change in the xy-plane orientation of the JM domain relative to the GxxxG face in response to this ordering of the bilayer (φ). Analysis of the E22,D23[0] systems at 0, 5, and 10 mol% Chol exhibit θ distributions centered near 45° which shift to 25 ° in 20 mol% Chol, indicating a major change in TMD conformation in the Lo phase.

In φ, multiple states which do not interconvert are observed. The populations of these states at 20 mol% Chol recorded in Table S1. Typically, the JM domain was positioned at φ=60° or 340° counterclockwise from the GxxxG face are observed from the N-terminus, the latter becoming more populated at 20 mol% Chol (Figure 3.A-D). However, the conformational distribution at 20 mol% Chol was found to be sensitive to both charge state and sequence of residues 22 and 23 (Figure 3.D-G). For E22,D23[-], θ fluctuates about 20° and φ is random. E22Q[0] exhibits three clear states in φ, with the JM domain sitting at about φ=60° and occasionally at φ=280°, and fluctuates about θ=35°. D23N exhibits slightly different behavior, as the JM domain populates three states characterized by (θ,φ)=(40,20°), (25,60°), and (25,140°). These observed differences in JM domain orientation (φ) and TMD tilt angles (θ) appear to be signatures of where and how Chol interacts with C99. The observation that the conformational ensembles of the JM domain and TMD tilt depend sensitively on the chemical state suggest that these changes in charge state and sequence could impact C99 homodimerization and C99-γ-secretase binding.

Insertion of the JM domain depends on sequence and charge state

The insertion depth of K16 serves as a measure of JM domain orientation relative to the bilayer surface. For C99 E22,D23[0] we observe that insertion of the JM domain increases with increasing mol% Chol (Figure 4.A). For E22,D23[-] the JM domain is observed to rarely insert in the membrane surface (Figure 4.B). It has been observed that insertion of the JM domain is necessary to complete the putative Chol binding site described by Sanders and coworkers, which involves hydrogen bonding of the JM domain to Chol O3.38 In the FAD mutants, E22Q and D23N, insertion of the JM domain is observed to be enhanced. Notably, the JM domain of the E22Q[0] mutant is observed to be consistently inserted throughout the simulations.

JM domain structure depends on pH

The presence of Chol in the membrane appears to shorten the α-helix of the C99 TMD of E22,D23[0] as the tilt angle of the TMD decreases (Figure 5.A). The measured distribution is consistent with that observed for the full C99 sequence.60 For E22Q[0] and D23N[0] we see similar helical propensities at 20 mol% Chol. However, in E22,D23[-] the JM domain is observed to be unstructured (Figure 5.B). As observed previously, the charge state of E22 and D23 at neutral pH destabilizes the JM domain, leading to extension of the unstructured JM domain into solvent. This pH switch38 supports a mechanism of pH-dependent insertion and evacuation of the JM domain in wildtype C99. However, this facility seems lost in the E22Q (Dutch) and D23N (Iowa) FAD mutants.

C99 Solvation by Cholesterol and DMPC

Residence times suggest C99 solvation, but not binding

The conjecture that cholesterol modulates the amyloid pathway by forming stable and specific complexes with C99 suggest that we should observe a relatively long-lived C99-cholesterol complex.27 Within an ensemble of C99-Chol interactions, it should be possible to distinguish “bound” Chol from “unbound” Chol, the latter only forming transient contacts with lifetimes similar to those of other C99-lipid interactions, and that persist for lifetimes in excess of other Chol-lipid interactions (roughly ~0.35 ns on average.)75 To do this we observed the residence time for each observed C99-Chol and C99-DMPC contact pair, tracked for each 100-ps time frame, to identify any Chol or DMPC initially in contact with C99 that maintained any contact with C99. This analysis was performed for all C99-Chol and C99-DMPC contact pairs observed in each system. It was found that the average C99-Chol and C99-DMPC lifetime is approximately 1-ns, longer than that of lipid-lipid interactions (Table S2). The log-log likelihood distributions of C99-Chol and C99-DMPC residence are well described by a power law (Figure 6 and S2). We find that the power law exponents, k, are similar for Chol and DMPC, and are between 1.25 to 1.43. This suggests that the C99-Chol interaction observed in simulation and experiment is heterogeneous without a characteristic time or energy scale for binding. For this reason, we refer to Chol and DMPC that persist in contact with C99 for over 25-ns as solvating as opposed to bound.

C99-cholesterol aggregate likelihood distributions

Our results suggest Chol does not form stable and specific bound complexes with C99. To explore the nature of longer-lived associations having residence times &gt;25-ns we address the following questions. We address the following questions. How many Chol can concurrently solvate C99? Do C99-Chol complexes in one leaflet impact formation of C99-Chol complexes in the opposite leaflet?

At 20 mol% we observe that Chol in the upper leaflet dimerizes with C99 between 20 to 40% of the time. Higher order aggregates form with varying probability depending on the state of residues 22 and 23 (Figure 7.A). In C99 D23N[0], the C99-Chol dimer is as likely as Chol-free C99. In addition, the rare tetramer forms, suggesting that the conformational ensemble of the JM domain in D23N provides more unique and stable interfaces on C99 for solvation by Chol. In the lower leaflet, we see that E22,D23[0], E22,D23[-], and E22Q[0] exhibit similar C99-Chol aggregate likelihoods (Figure 7.B). Here, too, D23N[0] exhibits enhanced C99-Chol aggregate likelihoods and sizes. As a function of Chol concentration, the C99-Chol dimer is not observed in upper and lower leaflets of less than 10 mol% Chol in E22,D23[0] (Figure S3). By examining the solvating Chol oligomer distribution without discrimination between the upper and lower leaflet, compared with the joint probability distribution implied if distributions of the upper and lower leaflet are uncorrelated, we find that the oligomer distributions in the upper and lower leaflets are uncorrelated (Figure 7.C). These observations imply that C99-Chol complexes are dependent on the conformational ensemble of C99, which is affected by the state of residues 22 and 23 and the introduction of the Lo phase by Chol.

Cholesterol distribution about C99 TMD assumes multiple complex interfaces

As the JM domain assumes various orientations relative to the GxxxG face dependent on the charge state or sequence of C99 (see Figure 3), the solvation interfaces of C99-Chol in the upper leaflet are expected to display varying likelihoods and solvation motifs.

In the C9916–55 congener, which lacks the C-terminal JM helix, the lower leaflet has no JM domain to obstruct Chol interactions with C99.60 We characterized the xy-plane mass density of upper leaflet Chol about the C99 TMD with the director oriented outward from the GxxxG face (see Figure 8). This GxxxG face has previously been hypothesized to serve as a specific Chol binding site and serves as a primary binding interface for the C99 homodimer. The GxxxG face was defined in terms of a vector in the xy-plane fit through the center of geometry of IIG33LM and the Cα of G33. We aligned the GxxxG face vector along the positive x-axis (now described using transformed coordinates x’ and y’) and identified five unique faces of C99 that support C99-Chol solvation for varying chemical states of E22 and D23 at 20 mol% Chol (Figure 8). These five interfaces (labeled from 1 to 5) correspond to polar angles 290-45°, 45-115°, 115-190°, 190-220°, and 220-290°, respectively, relative to the GxxxG face vector (0°). The potential of mean force (PMF) of the masses of solvating Chol at these interfaces is between 2.5 and 3 kcal/mol, within 1 kcal/mol of of the KdC99−Chol determined by Song et al.,32 suggesting that these solvating Chol are a reasonable representation of the bound cholesterol proposed by Sanders and coworkers.

C99-Chol complex motifs depend on juxtamembrane charge state and sequence

C99-Chol contacts formed in the upper leaflet of each solvation interface around the GxxxG face were measured using a 5 Å heavy atom distance contact criterion. Groups of averaged heavy atom contact pairs on Chol were used to define sites of interaction with C99 from the oxygen head (O), β-face (β), sterol rings A-D (A, B, C, D), and carbon tail segments (T1, T2) (see the Methodology section). C99-Chol contact maps were computed to define predominant C99-Chol contacts at contact interfaces stabilizied for various chemical states of C99 at 20 mol% Chol.

At interface 1 (Figure 9), which includes the GxxxG face, E22,D23[0], E22Q[0], and D23N[0] exhibit rare contacts to the C99 TMD and prominently feature H-bonds of Chol oxygen with K16 (occasionally with K28). These contacts were observed when the JM domain was positioned over the GxxxG face. While the population of interface 1 is higher than all other binding interfaces (Figure 8), C99-Chol complexes were not observed to be stabilized by contacts with the GxxxG face in conjunction with the JM domain as originally hypothesized by Beel et al.27 The GxxxG face only supports C99-Chol complexation when the JM domain is extended into solvent, as observed for E22,D23[-]. The complex is primarily stabilized by H-bonds of K28 with Chol O3 and π-stacking with ring B. Similarly, at other solvation interfaces where H-bonding with K28 to Chol O3 was observed, C99-Chol contacts were formed most prominently with the α-face of Chol with support from π-stacking with ring B, and less frequently with the β-face, with Chol tail groups T1 and T2 contacting G38 and I41 (or G37 and V40) and A42 and I45 (or I41 and V44), respectively. C99 E22Q[0] and D23N[0] generally exhibit fewer contacts between the C99 TMD and sterol and tail groups of Chol.

At interface 2 (Figure 9), C99-Chol contacts were predominantly stabilized by hydrogen bonds with K16 in C99 E22,D23[0] and N27 and K28 in E22,D23[-] and E22Q[0]. D23N exhibits variable H-bonding of Chol with the JM domain in addition to N27 and K28. At interface 3, K28 H-bonding supports all observed C99-Chol contacts. In C99 E22,D23[-] and D23N[0], these contacts were also supported by K16 H-bonding. At interface 4, C99 E22,D23[0] exhibited prominent β-face binding chiefly stabilized via interaction of T1 with G38, as well as I41 and T2 with A42 and V45. C99 E22,D23[-] displayed solvation by the Chol α-face stabilized by various H-bonds with residues 27-30 and π-stacking with ring B. C99 E22Q[0] was observed to form occasional H-bonds solely with K28, while E22,D23[-], E22Q[0], and D23N[0] occasionally engaged in π-stacking with ring B. At interface 5, non-specific H-bonds formed to the JM domain and turn region in E22,D23[0], accompanied by contacts of Chol tail groups with residues 40, 41, 44, and 45. E22,D23[-] and D22Q[0] both presented qualitatively similar contacts to those observed at interface 4. D23N[0] displayed prominent α- and β-face solvation stabilized by H-bonding with residues 26-30, most often with K28. For C99 E22,D23[-], H-bonding of the JM domain with Chol O3 occured in the rare instances where the unstructured JM domain was inserted in the membrane, as it was observed at interface 1.

Considering C99-Chol interaction in the lower leaflet, absent a reentrant JM helix (including the C-helix60), Chol freely contacts residues at the C-terminal end of the TMD. We observed no specific interfaces for C99-Chol association along the C-terminal TMD of C99. Within the lower leaflet, E22,D23[0], E22,D23[-], and E22Q[0] were all observed to support C99-Chol association via H-bonding of Chol O3 to the lysine anchor K53K54K55 and contact between the Chol β- and α-faces (via ring A) along the C-terminal end of the TMD (Figure S4). The end of the Chol tail (T1,T2) also forms many contacts with the TMD. D23N[0] Chol complexation in particular was found to be stabilized by interaction of L34 with T2, facilitated by the enhanced tilt angle of the TMD (see Figure 3).

C99-DMPC complex solvates C99 without specificity and outcompetes Lys-Cholesterol Hydrogen Bonding

Give the pattern of C99-Chol solvation interfaces in the upper leaflet, it is reasonable to ask if solvating DMPC is characterized by a spatially complementary mass distribution about the C99 TMD. In fact, we find that C99-DMPC mass densities about the GxxxG face show virtually no preference of DMPC for any face of the C99 TMD (Figure 10). This further supports the conjecture that, though cholesterol does not bind C99, it shows spatially anisotropic solvation of C99 (Figure 8) in contrast to lipids such as DMPC.

Analysis of C99-DMPC contact maps for dimer associations having &gt;25-ns residence times reveal that, much like Chol, DMPC prominently interacts with the JM domain and the N-loop in addition to the TMD and the Lys anchor. However, interaction with Lys does not appear to be very important for stabilizing C99-DMPC complexes. This lack of specific interaction with Lys, that is responsible for dependence of Chol position on the orientation of the JM domain and N-loop, results in DMPC solvating the C99 TMD without orientational specificity.

We evaluate the average number of monopartite hydrogen bonds and salt bridges formed in each trajectory between one C99 and one Chol or DMPC averaged over the number of replicate trajectories (Table S3). The DMPC PC and ester groups each have 4 oxygens which form 44 potential monopartite hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with the 5 Lys of C99. The Chol hydroxyl group can form 17 monopartite hydrogen bonds with the Lys of C99.We observe that the Lys-PC salt bridge substantially outcompetes hydrogen bonding groups, forming 6.7 times more often than the ester group, and 53 times more often than the Chol hydroxyl group. This comparison does not account for the ratio of DMPC/Chol in these systems or the total number of potential monopartite hydrogen bonds available to the PC and ester groups compared to the hydroxyl group. Reweighting the average number of Chol hydrogen bonds observed based on the DMPC/Chol (5/1 at 20 mol%) and the ratio of PC/hydroxyl (or ester/hydroxyl) potential hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (44/17), we find that the PC group is 4 times more likely to form a salt bridge with Lys than form a hydrogen bond with the Chol hydroxyl. However, we do find that the Chol hydroxyl is 1.7 times more likely to hydrogen bond with Lys than the DMPC ester if reweighted in this way. Perhaps it is this slightly higher affinity for the Chol hydroxyl group to Lys over the ester group that manifests this anisotropy around the TMD.

Recently, it was demonstrated that the phosphate-Lys interaction is 0.7 kcal/mol more stable than expected. It was suggested that the discrepancy could be corrected by increasing the minimum in the Lennard-Jones potential by 0.08 Å.76 We did not employ this correction. However, it should be expected that interactions with PC and the hydrogen bonding groups of sphingolipids and gangliosides that are found in lipid rafts, where C99 is evidenced to be processed, would outcompete Chol hydroxyl-Lys interactions. Within plasma membranes, where C99 is thought to play an important role in cholesterol homeostasis, the exo-facing leaflet generally has twice the saturated/unsaturated lipid ratio of the cyto-facing leaflet,77 making it more likely that the N-terminus of C99, which forms specific but weak complexes with Chol, to be present in lipid raft domains. Therefore, though interactions that might contribute to stabilization of a specific, bound C99-Chol dimer are surpassed by interactions between other lipids in the membrane. Nevertheless, cholesterol is expected to interact with C99 in plasma membranes and affect its conformational ensemble.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Elucidation of the structure, stability, and possible function of C99-cholesterol complexation has received considerable attention since the initial report of specific binding of cholesterol to C99.26,27 Functional roles proposed for specific binding of cholesterol to C99 have included cholesterol sensing, competition with C99 homodimerization, and C99 partitioning to Lo “raft” domains containing γ-secretase involved in cleavage of C99 and Aβ biogenesis. Nevertheless, clear characterization of the structure of the C99-Chol complex has proved elusive. To address this fundamental question, we have employed unbiased, rigorously sampled atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the nature of C99-cholesterol interaction.

MD simulations of the wildtype sequence of the C9916–55 congener protein were performed in DMPC lipid bilayers at 0, 5, 10, and 20 mol% concentrations mimicking prior experimental studies of C99 in bicelles.28 Formation of the Lo phase was observed at 20 mol% cholesterol, leading to an increase in tilt angle of C99 and impacting the depth of insertion of the JM domain and its orientation relative to the TMD. These changes may be indirectly responsible for changes in chemical shift initially attributed to the binding of cholesterol to C9928 used to indirectly determine the equilibrium constant of C99-cholesterol dissociation.32 Indeed, it was found that the C99 heterodimer lifetimes with cholesterol and DMPC manifest as similar power law distributions, displaying no clear signature of a bound C99-cholesterol heterodimer with a characteristic time scale and binding free energy.

For the purpose of investigating how complexed cholesterol might yet affect C99 structure, we investigated cholesterol and DMPC with C99 heterodimer lifetimes exceeding 25-ns as representative of long-lived complexes. We characterized the structure of C99 and C99-cholesterol interactions for C99 charged states representative of endosomal membranes at pH ≤ 6.5 (E22,D23[0]) and plasma membranes at neutral pH (E22,D23[-]), as well as the Dutch (E22Q[0]) and Iowa (D23N[0]) FAD mutants at pH ≤ 6.5. At 20 mol% cholesterol we found the C99 E22,D23[-] JM domain α-helix to be unstructured and extended into aqueous solvent. In contrast, in E22,D23[0], E22Q[0], and D23N[0] the JM domain features a structured α-helix. Of these, E22,D23[0] and D23N[0] were able to “switch” between a membrane-inserted and membrane-evacuated structure, while E22Q[0] was found to be exclusively inserted into the lipid bilayer.

The wildtype sequence of C99 was observed to support many different orientations of the JM domain relative to the GxxxG face, supporting multiple interfaces for solvation by cholesterol. E22Q[0] and D23N[0] do not exhibit pH switching behavior, instead consistently presenting a stable JM domain α-helix and a restricted set of conformational states. In the upper leaflet, five interfaces defined by orientation of Chol density relative to the GxxxG face were found to describe conformations of the C99 TMD solvated by cholesterol, having free energies derived from potential of mean force calculations within 1 kcal/mol of the experimentally-derived dissociation constant.32 Most complexes were stabilized by H-bonding of the cholesterol hydroxyl group to K16 and K28 and π-stacking interaction of the second cholesterol ring with the C99 TMD. Within the lower leaflet, complexes were characterized by H-bonding of cholesterol to the lysine anchor K53K54K55, non-specific contacts along the α- and β-face of cholesterol, and interaction of the cholesterol tail with the center of the C99 TMD.

Curiously, it was found that C99-DMPC complexes did not exhibit the specificity for interfaces on the C99 TMD as observed for cholesterol. We attribute this to the lack of necessity for specific interactions with Lys to stabilize the complex as is observed with C99-Chol. Additionally, it was found that DMPC outcompetes cholesterol for hydrogen bonding with Lys, even when weighted for the total number of monopartite hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that may be formed and the DMPC/cholesterol ratio. This further supports the notion that cholesterol does not bind to C99, as the necessary hydrogen bonds are quickly replaced by competition with strongly interacting groups from other lipids.

Using unbiased MD simulations of C99 in DMPC-cholesterol lipid bilayers, we have provided insight into the atomic-level details of C99-cholesterol interactions. Our work suggests that there is no specific C99-cholesterol dimerization interface as initially hypothesized by Beel et al.,26 and that the large C99-Chol dissociation constant determined by Song et al.32 is consistent with short-lived but specific C99-cholesterol complexes observed in our simulations. Recently proposed42 roles for C99 regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and Aβ production suggest a role for both lipid raft domains and the pH cellular compartments. The multiple weak cholesterol solvation interfaces with C99 that we describe in this work provide insight into C99-Chol interactions that may play a key role in those environments.
