Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Herein, this study aims to quantify clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in blood samples from AD patients and evaluate these two proteins as potential biomarkers in AD diagnosis. In-house synthesized 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags were used to label target peptide standards at different concentrations to construct standard curves. Our study revealed that the levels of CLU and APOE exhibited clear differences in male vs. female AD groups but not in male vs. female non-AD groups. In contrast, the levels of serum CLU and APOE did not show statistically significant differences in the AD groups and non-AD groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants. Significance: Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for sex-related pathways, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common form of dementia among the elders, which is characterized by the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and aggregation of protein tau in the brain [1]. In the past decades, tremendous efforts have been made to understand underlying pathogenesis, identify protective and pathogenic genes, and discover and validate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood-based biomarkers via brain imaging and other techniques. Medical temporal lobe atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and posterior cingulate and temporoparietal hypometabolism on 18fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG)- positron emission tomography (PET) and cortical Aβ deposition on amyloid-PET imaging are well-validated neuroimaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis [2]. In addition, CSF biomarkers including amyloid β1–42 (Aβ42), amyloid β1–40 (Aβ40), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), p-tau217 and total tau (t-tau) are well-established [3, 4]. Compared to imaging biomarkers and CSF-based biomarkers, blood-based biomarkers enable easier access and can reduce the cost and invasiveness in clinical practice. Therefore, blood sample is an appealing resource to discover and validate biomarkers for AD. Thus far, plasma Aβ 42/40 ratio (Aβ42/40) has been reported to show reduction in AD and can be sensitively measured as biomarker [5–7]. Also, recent studies demonstrated excellent performance of phosphorylated tau 181 and 217 in plasma as diagnostic biomarkers for AD versus other dementias [8–10]. The encouraging and rapid developments in blood-based assays is promising for prescreening in preclinical practice with reduced cost and invasiveness, and once validated, for clinical diagnosis [11]. In addition to Aβ and tau, recent studies in deep proteome profiling of serum, CSF and cortex in AD discovered numerous differentially expressed proteins which need further verifications before clinical practice[12, 13]. Among the AD-related proteins, clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) play important roles in Aβ clearance and deposition [14–17].

CLU is a 78–80 kDa heterodimeric glycoprotein that is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and functions as an extracellular chaperone that can facilitate the transport of Aβ across the blood-brain barrier [18–20]. It has been suggested that CLU can bind to Aβ oligomers to interfere with peptide aggregation and inhibit the growth of extracellular amyloid fibrils [14–16]. There is also significant positive correlation between the concentration of CLU and the regional levels of insoluble Aβ42 in the brain [14–16]. APOE is a 299-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of ~34 kDa that serves important functions in lipoprotein-mediated lipid transportation among organs [21]. The peripheral pool of APOE is mainly expressed by the liver, and in the CNS, APOE is mainly produced by astrocytes and microglia [22, 23]. APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 are the three major APOE isoforms encoded by the Apolipoprotein E2, E3, and E4 alleles, respectively [22]. In general, APOE3 is the most common variant, and APOE4 variant is associated with higher risk for AD, while APOE2 is protective [22, 24]. Previous study showed that APOE may negatively affect clearance of soluble Aβ and Aβ deposition at different stages of plaque formation [17].

However, comparing APOE concentration in patients at different developmental stages of AD showed different and unconvincing results in CSF and plasma samples in different studies [25–28]. Regardless of the APOE genotype, previous studies in our lab observed significant alterations of total APOE levels in CSF of AD patients compared to healthy control [29, 30]. As both CLU and APOE are involved in Aβ plaque formation, here, we focused on evaluating the total concentrations of these two proteins in blood samples and to validate their capability to serve as potential biomarkers respectively and together in AD. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is commonly used for measuring protein expression levels in blood and clinical biomarker verification, but the requirement of high-quality antibodies and difficulties when it comes to developing multiplexed assays compromise its applicability to verify novel protein biomarkers [31]. By introducing stable isotope amino acids into proteins metabolically, amino acid-coded mass tagging (AACT) or stable isotope labeling by amino acids (SILAC) can be used for large-scale relative quantification of cellular proteins [32, 33]. However, this strategy usually is applicable to cell culture and bacteria but not for blood samples. In contrast, absolute quantification (AQUA) strategies using synthetic heavy isotope-encoded peptides as internal standards can be applied to quantifying native peptides in the blood samples [34]. However, the high cost of the isotopically labeled internal peptides limits its usage for verification of a large number of candidate biomarkers. Alternatively, commercially available mass differential tags can be used for relative and absolute quantification such as mass differential tags for relative and absolute quantification (mTRAQ) tag, and iTRAQ [35–38]. Meanwhile, combined precursor isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging (cPILOT) was developed for improved multiplex sample tagging [39]. Previous studies in our lab show that the 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags are cost-effective and enable improved quantification accuracy [40]. iDiLeu-labeling strategy enables construction of a 4-point calibration curve and has been adopted previously to quantify analytes in CSF samples [29]. In this study, we applied a 5-plex iDiLeu-labeling strategy to perform absolute quantification for APOE and CLU in serum samples of AD and non-AD participants and investigate their potential to serve as blood-based biomarkers for AD.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Serum samples

The samples were from patients who sought medical advice because of cognitive impairment. CSF samples were collected by lumbar puncture. Blood was sampled by venipuncture at the same time as the CSF and collected in gel separator tubes. Following clotting for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 2200 × g for 10 min with the temperature set at +20 °C. The supernatant was collected, aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Patients were designated as AD and non-AD according to CSF biomarker levels, generated using INNOTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium), using cutoffs that are &gt;90% specific for AD: total-tau (T-tau) &gt;350 pg/mL, phospho-tau 181 (P-tau181) &gt;60 pg/mL and Aβ42 &lt;530 pg/mL (2 out of 3 positive) [41]. None of the biochemically normal subjects fulfilled these criteria. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee at the University of Gothenburg.

2.2 Serum protein digestion

Ten μL of serum was diluted in 190 μL water and protein concentrations were measured by protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Serum proteins were dissolved in 6 M urea, 50 mM tris buffer (contains 5 mM CaCl2, 20 mM NaCl, and 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 8), reduced by dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 5 mM for 1 h. Fifteen mM of iodoacetamide was added for alkylation of cysteines by incubating for 30 min in dark, followed by addition of 5 mM dithiothreitol for quenching unreacted iodoacetamide. Then the protein mixture was digested with trypsin/LysC (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, United States) at a protein:enzyme ratio of 25:1 at 37 °C for 3 h. The sample was then diluted by 50 mM Tris buffer to a final urea concentration of 1 M, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 h. The digestion reaction was quenched by acidification with 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 0.3% (pH 3), followed by desalting with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Corporation, Milford, Massachusetts, MA, United States). Then the digested peptides were dried down with a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid (FA). Peptide concentration was measured by peptide assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, United States). Then peptide digestion was aliquot at 50 μg in each tube and was dried in vacuo for further use.

2.3 Peptide and protein standards preparation

Stock solutions of synthetic human peptide (Biomatik, Ontario, Canada) ASSIIDELFQDR (unique peptide of CLU), were prepared at 1 mM. Recombinant human APOE3 (Cat. No. SRP4696) from Sigma-Aldrich (Missouri, USA) protein standard was digested, and the concentrations of digested peptides were measured according to procedures described above. Based on the molecular weight of APOE and concentrations of digested peptides, we could calculate the molar amount. iDiLeu reagents were in-house synthesized as previously described [40, 42]. In each peptide aliquot, 4 nmol of CLU peptide standard (about 4 μg) was combined with 400 pmol APOE protein digests (about 14.5 μg), and the mixture was resuspended in 10 μL of 0.5 M triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer. Each mixture was labeled by each iDiLeu tag (d0, d3, d6, d9, and d12) at a ratio of 10:1 (tags–peptide, by weight) or higher with excessive tags. A volume of 40 μL of activated iDiLeu tags was added to each aliquot to 80:20 organic–aqueous solution ratio and shake for 1.5 h at room temperature, respectively. Hydroxylamine (50%) was added to a final concentration of 0.25% to quench the reaction.

Unreacted reagents and by-products of iDiLeu-labeling reaction were removed by SCX TopTips (PolyLC INC., Columbia, MD, United States) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The eluate was dried in vacuo and desalted with Bond Elut OMIX C18 pipette tips (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States).

Serum protein digests were reconstituted in 10 μL of 0.5 M TEAB and labeled with d0 iDiLeu tag separately according to the peptide standards labeling procedure described above. The other four tag-labeled peptide standards were spiked into each d0-labeled serum sample in a ratio of 1:5:25:100. The combined sample was cleaned up with SCX TopTips and desalted with Bond Elut OMIX C18 pipette tips. For correction factor calculation, four μg of each labeled peptide standard was cleaned up with SCX TopTips and desalted with Bond Elut OMIX C18 pipette tips. All the labeled samples were then dried in vacuo and reconstituted in 50 μL. of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water.

2.4 NanoLC–MS acquisition

LC separation was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Thermo Scientific). Capillary column (15 cm length, 75 μm i.d.) was self-fabricated and packed with Bridged Ethylene Hybrid C18 materials (1.7 μm, 130 Å, Waters Corporation). Samples were loaded onto the column in 97% solvent A (water, 0.1% FA) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min. Reverse-phase separation was performed using a linear gradient from 3% to 35% solvent B (ACN, 0.1% FA) for 90 min. Peptide elution was electrosprayed into an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid quadrupole-ion trap-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Full MS scan was acquired in profile mode ranging from m/z 350 to 950 at a resolution of 60 K. Automatic gain control (AGC) target was set as 1× 106, and maximum injection time was 120 ms. The top 20 most abundant precursor ions were selected for stepped higher-energy collisional dissociation fragmentation with a dynamic exclusion for 40 s with 10 ppm. MS2 spectra were acquired at centroid mode. The resolution was set as 30 K, isolation window of 1.6 Th, stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27, 30 and 33, the maximum injection time of 60 ms, AGC target of 1 × 105, and fixed first mass of m/z 110. Each sample was acquired in three technical replicates.

2.5 Data analysis

Protein identification was performed using MaxQuant (version 1.5.2.8) against SwissProt human database (February 2020) with 1% false discovery rate (FDR) at peptide and protein level. The first search peptide tolerance for precursor and product ion were 20 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. The maximum missed cleavages per peptide were set at 2. Fixed modification was set as carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.0215 Da) and d0 labeling of N-terminal of peptides and lysine residues (+141.1154 Da). Oxidation of methionine (+15.9949 Da) was selected as variable modification. The intensity obtained from relative quantification in MaxQuant was further analyzed in Excel for advanced downstream analysis. For absolute quantification of CLU and APOE, protein identification was performed using the Peaks Studio Xpro software (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada). The data refinement was used to adjust precursor mass by default. All the raw files were searched with UniProt Homo sapiens reviewed database with trypsin as digestion enzyme. The mass error tolerance for precursor ions was 15 ppm using monoisotopic mass and 0.02 Da for product ions. The maximum missed cleavages per peptide were set as two, allowed to be cleaved at both ends of the peptides. Fixed modification was set as carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (57.0215 Da), iDiLeu labels (+141.1154 Da, +144.1313 Da, +147.1409 Da, +150.1631 Da, and +153.1644 Da for d0, d3, d6, d9 and d12 tag, respectively) of peptide N-termini and lysine residues, along with oxidation of methionine (+15.9949 Da) chosen as variable modifications. Peptides with FDR &lt; 1% were considered as unambiguous identifications. Peak areas generated by Genesis peak detection algorithm in Thermo Xcalibur 4.0 software were used for absolute quantification. The precursor ion integration tolerance was 0.015 Da. Retention time of extracted ion chromatogram of 5-plex iDiLeu-labeled peptides was required to be within 2 min. Isotopic interference correction factors were applied to each sample to correct the raw values. A two-sided Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the differences of the protein expression levels in the serum samples. A p-value of 0.05 or less is the cutoff for significance.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Workflow of a 5-plex iDiLeu-labeling strategy to perform absolute quantification for serum proteins

A schematic illustration of the workflow used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. Briefly, serum proteins extracted from male or female AD patients or non-AD cohort were subjected to trypsin digestion. The resultant serum tryptic peptides were labeled with d0 channel of 5-plex iDiLeu tags. Target tryptic peptide standards were labeled with d3, d6, d9, and d12 channels, respectively. The four channels labeled peptide standards were spiked into each serum sample with known molar ratio to enable creating a 4-point calibration curve that allow determination of absolute concentration of target surrogate peptide in serum samples.

3.2 Patient demographics

Ten patients with AD (5 men and 5 women), and 9 healthy non-AD individuals (5 men and 4 women) were included in this study. Table 1. summarizes the demographic characteristics of the participants. Statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in CSF levels of T-tau, p-tau181 and Aβ1–42 concentrations were found between AD patients and non-AD individuals. No statistically significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) in age were found between AD patients and non-AD individuals (Supplementary Table S1).

3.3 Quantitative performance of 5-Plex iDiLeu-labeling strategy

First, label-free and d0 tag-labeled serum protein digests were tested in LC-MS/MS, where CLU and APOE were identified with confidence. A mixture of 5-plex iDiLeu-labeled peptide standard/protein standard digests were then used to evaluate the performance of the iDiLeu-labeling strategy. Impurities of starting materials for the synthesis of iDiLeu tags can compromise the quantification accuracy. When 5-plex iDiLeu reagents are employed to label peptides, mass additions of 141.1154, 144.1313, 147.1409, 150.1631, and 153.1644 Da are added to peptides by d0, d3, d6, d9, and d12 labels, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The mass of five monoisotopic precursors will be 3 Da or 6 Da apart which will cause isotopic interference. To overcome these pitfalls, we firstly determined the correction factors for each of the 5-plex iDiLeu tags to ensure accurate quantification (Supplementary Table S3). The correction factors were calculated following previous literature [40]. To evaluate the linearity of the concentration range used in this iDiLeu-labeling strategy, unique peptide standards from CLU and APOE proteins were labeled with 5-plex iDiLeu tags and combined at a ratio of 10:1:5:25:100. Two peptides (ASSIIDELFQDR and AATVGSLAGQPLQER) were selected as internal standards. For serum protein digestion, we used trypsin/Lys-C to achieve high-level of complete and specific proteolytic cleavage of protein samples. Nine unique peptides of CLU were identified (Supplementary Table S4). These 9 peptides were subjected to criteria described by a previous study, including no miscleavages, between 7 and 30 amino acids residues, no potential modification sites and no ragged end (C-terminal KK, RR, KR or RK) [43]. Out of the 9 specific peptides, 3 peptides met the criteria, including SGSGLVGR, EIQNAVNGVK and ASSIIDELFQDR. However, only peptide ASSIIDELFQDR existed in all of the six isoforms of CLU based on alignment results from Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (Supplementary Table S5). A previous study showed that ASSIIDELFQDR as surrogate worked well for absolute quantification of CLU in human brain [44]. Therefore, we chose ASSIIDELFQDR as surrogate for CLU. Similarly, we selected peptide AATVGSLAGQPLQER as surrogate for APOE. While several other peptides of APOE also met the criteria the linearity of calibration curves generated were not as good as peptide AATVGSLAGQPLQER, possibly because of interferences from other peptides with similar molecular weight being eluted at the same time. And some peptides with relatively low ionization efficiency and signal intensity had missing value for d0-labeled peptide standard. Therefore, they were not chosen as surrogates. Surrogate peptide AATVGSLAGQPLQER chosen for APOE was also used in previous study for absolute quantification of APOE in CSF samples [29]. Furthermore, we did not detect miscleavages of the cleavage sites in these two peptides, consistent with previous studies showing that the cleavage sites where glutamic acid (E) or aspartic acid (D) residues located immediately to the N-terminal side of arginine (R) can be efficiently cleaved by Lys-C although they are prone to be miscleaved by trypsin [45, 46]. Taken together, these peptides could serve as good surrogates for these proteins. The concentration of stock solution of iDiLeu-labeled CLU peptide (ASSIIDELFQDR) ranged from 50 ~ 5000 fmol/μL and then diluted to prepare concentrations of 10 ~ 1000 fmol/μL and 2 ~ 200 fmol/μL. For the APOE peptides, the concentration of stock solution of iDiLeu-labeled APOE peptide (AATVGSLAGQPLQER) ranged from 5 ~ 500 fmol/μL and then diluted twice to prepare concentrations of 1 ~ 100 fmol/μL and 0.2 ~ 20 fmol/μL. Based on literature, these concentration ranges should cover all the reported concentrations of these two proteins in human serum samples [28, 48]. Fig. 2 displayed normalized peak areas corresponding to the concentrations of iDiLeu-labeled CLU peptides and APOE peptides across LC–MS analysis in duplicates by normalization to the d12 channel (the normalized peak area of d12 channel was set as 100). Each calibration curve revealed a good correlation with coefficient above 0.99 and a linear concentration range spanning two orders of magnitude. Compared to those which correction factors were not applied (Supplementary Fig. S1), we could find an improvement of the linearity of the calibration curves in Fig. 2. For the concentration range used for quantification of CLU in serum, the coefficient of variation (CV) was below 6.5% in the range of 10 ~ 1000 fmol/μL. The CV was below 5% in the concentration of 1 ~ 100 fmol/μL for APOE. The excellent linearity in the concentration range we used for quantification confirmed that iDiLeu-labeling is a good strategy for absolute quantification of these two proteins.

3.4 Absolute quantification of CLU and APOE in Alzheimer’s disease

Here, we used undepleted serum samples because CLU and APOE have relatively high abundance and can be detected by the sensitive instrument platform. Compared with antibody-based protein depletion strategy, which may lead to co-immunoprecipitation and sample loss, the undepleted serum samples may give a more accurate quantification result with lower variation [49]. Here, we set up the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) to do absolute quantification for two peptides of CLU and APOE using 5-plex iDiLeu reagents in both AD participants and non-AD participants. It is worth noting that, considering its sensitivity and reproducibility, data independent acquisition (DIA) may be a more powerful method for the study of ultra-low abundance proteins or post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins [50, 51]. Each serum sample was labeled with d0 tag, and standard peptides with a ratio of 1:5:25:100 were labeled with d3, d6, d9, d12, respectively. The labeled peptide standards were then spiked into each serum sample with equal amount at the same ratio. The final concentration of labeled peptide standard ASSIIDELFQDR ranged from 0.5 ~ 50 pmol/50 μg serum protein digests and the final concentration of labeled APOE digests ranged from 0.05 ~ 5 pmol/50 μg serum protein digests. iDiLeu-labeled peptides were fragmented under stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27, 30 and 33. Fig. 3 shows representative tandem mass spectra of d0-labeled ASSIIDELFQDR and AATVGSLAGQPLQER in serum sample. iDiLeu d0 tag was fragmented to produce dimethylated immonium reporter ion at m/z of 114.1. Rich b- and y- product ions were matched to specific peptide sequence with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 1%, which reflected the statistical significance of the peptide-spectrum match [52]. For the data analysis of each sample in PEAKS, the peptide score (−10lgP) threshold was determined by applying FDR of 1%. A peptide with a higher −10lgP score than the score threshold indicates an FDR lower than 1%. Both peptides in all the samples showed a higher score than the peptide score threshold, indicating high confidence of identification (Supplementary Table S6). The plot of normalized peak area of each peptide against concentration displayed high linearity, which ensured the accuracy of protein quantification (Fig. 4A and 4C). A coefficient of variation (CV) within 12% was demonstrated across the triplicate runs of each sample, indicating a good technical repeatability within the technical replicates.

The average concentrations of CLU were quantified as 287 and 379 μg/mL in male and female of AD, and 299 and 283 μg/mL in serum of male and female of non-AD, respectively (Fig. 4B). The average concentrations of APOE were 29 and 53 μg/mL in male and female AD participants, and 31 and 35 μg/mL in male and female of non-AD participants, respectively (Fig. 4D). Based on these measurements (see Supplementary Table S7), we found that there were no significant differences of APOE or CLU between AD and non-AD participants. Interestingly, the data showed a higher expression level of both CLU and APOE in the female AD participants compared with male AD participants, with a p-value of 0.034 and 0.033 respectively. This may be because that female and male are impacted by some of the AD risk factors differently and thus have different expression levels of AD-related proteins [53]; clearly, more in-depth and larger-scale analyses will be necessary to draw a firm conclusion. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants (Supplementary Fig. 2). Previous studies show that the isoforms of APOE and post-translational modification (PTM) patterns of APOE are related to AD risks [22, 54]. CLU levels in the blood/CSF/brain and epigenetic regulation of CLU may also play important roles in AD pathogenesis [55, 56]. Recent studies in our lab shows that the glycosylation level of CLU decreased in CSF of AD (X. Zhong et al., unpublished data), and the glycosylation patterns of CLU also exhibited differences between AD and healthy control participants [56]. In a recent study, quantitative proteomics map of 95 PTMs on multiple isoforms of Tau was generated to enable a more comprehensive view of Tau isoforms and related PTMs in AD, which may lead to improved understanding of AD pathology and facilitate rational design of therapeutic agents and diagnostics for AD based on Tau pathology [57]. Therefore, further studies focusing on in-depth characterization of the isoforms and PTMs of CLU and APOE in blood samples may help to better elucidate their intriguing roles in AD pathogenesis and develop potential biomarkers for AD diagnosis or treatment strategies.

4. Conclusion

In summary, we measured the concentration of CLU and APOE proteins in human serum using custom-developed 5-plex iDiLeu tags. Although we did not find significant differences in these two protein concentrations between the AD participants and non-AD participants in the limited cohort we examined, we observed intriguing differences in the levels of these two proteins between female and male of the AD participants. If replicated with larger cohort, these results might provide new insights into the underlying pathogenesis of AD related to gender differences that have been less explored. More in-depth and larger cohort studies are necessary to confirm these intriguing results and may lead to future development of more personalized therapeutic approaches. In this study, we showed the effectiveness and robustness of the iDiLeu-labeling strategy in absolute quantification of proteins using Orbitrap MS platforms, and this strategy could also be easily adapted on other instrument platforms such as a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. A future evaluation of the accuracy and reproducibility of the iDiLeu-based absolute quantification on TOF MS instruments would be very meaningful, and the advantage of the high speed of TOF MS instrument may enable the quantification of a larger sample cohort and facilitate more conclusive results. We envision this cost-effective isotopic labeling strategy could be broadly applied to protein quantification and biomarker verification across many different types of biofluids and various diseases.

Accurate absolute quantification of CLU and APOE in serum.

Absolute protein quantification via 5-plex isotopic DiLeu reagents.

Higher expression levels of CLU and APOE in female vs. male of AD.

Significance Statement

As blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis are cost-effective and introduce less invasiveness, discovery and validation of biomarkers in the blood samples of AD patients have become a hot topic in Alzheimer’s and dementia research. Thus far, amyloid β (Aβ), total-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood show great accuracy and specificity in diagnosis of AD. However, the underlying mechanism of AD pathology remains to be elusive and complex. Besides these well studied proteins, many other proteins, such as clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have also been found to be related to AD development. It has been implicated that these two proteins are involved in Aβ clearance and deposition. In this study, we measure the absolute concentrations of these two proteins in blood and shed some light on the potential roles of CLU and APOE in AD pathology. Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for specific pathways between different genders, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD.
