In Alzheimer’s disease, brain amyloid deposition has a distinct topography that correlates with aerobic glycolysis (AG), i.e., the use of glucose in the brain beyond that predicted by oxygen consumption. The causes for this relationship remain unclear but might provide critical insight into how and why amyloid deposition begins. Here we develop statistical methods to study the earliest topography of amyloid deposition based on amyloid imaging and investigate its spatiotemporal evolution with respect to the topography of AG in young and older adults. We find that the spatiotemporal dynamics of amyloid deposition are largely explained by one factor, defined here as the amyloid topography dissimilarity index (ATDI). Using ATDI, we demonstrate that subthreshold amyloid accumulates primarily in regions that have high AG during early adulthood; this relationship is weaker with brain oxygen metabolism. ATDI is also bimodal, more highly dynamic during early amyloid accumulation, and predicts which individuals will cross a conservative quantitative threshold at least 3–5 years in advance. Our findings thus suggest that early on-target subthreshold amyloid deposition mirrors its later regional pattern, which best corresponds to the topography of young adult brain AG.

Introduction

Brain amyloid deposition is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Braak and Braak, 1991; Jack et al., 2018). Amyloid brain PET imaging is routinely defined as being positive according to either qualitative assessment or a quantitative threshold (Klunk et al., 2015; Lopresti et al., 2005; Mintun et al., 2006; Ng et al., 2007; Su et al., 2013). Typically, amyloid imaging crosses these thresholds years before the onset of cognitive decline in AD (Jack et al., 2015; Mintun et al., 2006; Morris and Price, 2001; Vlassenko et al., 2011). One commonly used metric for amyloid positivity is the mean cortical standard uptake value ratio (MC-SUVR), which has been shown to reliably represent true amyloid deposition once it crosses a threshold (e.g., ~1.4 for Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PIB) brain PET imaging), though current thresholds may be overly-conservative (Jack et al., 2015; Jack et al., 2017).

Previously, our laboratory found that when amyloid deposition is well above this threshold, the regional topography of 11C-PIB correlates with the topography of aerobic glycolysis (AG) as measured in young healthy adults (Vlassenko et al., 2010). AG refers to glucose use beyond that predicted by oxygen consumption rates, and likely reflects a combination of lactate production (i.e. the Warburg effect) as well as other intermediary pathways that do not consume oxygen (Locasale and Cantley, 2011; Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011). AG has been recently associated with supporting synaptic function, plasticity, and neuroprotection (Goyal et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2019; Harris et al., 2016; Newington et al., 2011; Segarra-Mondejar et al., 2018; Shannon et al., 2016; Vlassenko and Raichle, 2015). The relationship between amyloid deposition and AG is further supported by studies in mouse models of AD that demonstrate an association between neuronal activity, interstitial lactate levels and interstitial amyloid-beta content in the brain (Bero et al., 2011; Cirrito et al., 2005; Macauley et al., 2015).

It is currently unknown why brain AG is associated with amyloid deposition. Moreover, how AG relates to the spatiotemporal evolution of subthreshold amyloid deposition in the human brain remains unclear. In particular, understanding how brain metabolism relates to the earliest stages of amyloid accumulation might provide insight into the pathogenesis of the proteostasis failure that contributes to amyloid deposition. Indeed, there has been increasing interest recently in evaluating early amyloid accumulation below the current conservative thresholds of amyloid imaging positivity (Bischof and Jacobs, 2019; Thomas et al., 2020). Some cortical regions, such as the precuneus, which is an essential component of the default mode network, show earlier amyloid radiotracer uptake than others and this observation has been used to define different stages of amyloid topography, though these stages are variably defined (Brier et al., 2016; Grothe et al., 2017; Mattsson et al., 2019).

In order to investigate brain metabolism and other potential factors contributing to the onset of amyloid accumulation, we first need a measure that more precisely identifies the spatiotemporal evolution of early and subthreshold amyloid deposition in vivo. Simply using quantitative metrics such as MC-SUVR or the related centiloid scale would ignore the possibility that subthreshold amyloid accumulation might be significantly masked by the off-target binding of an amyloid tracer. Accordingly, under the premise that off-target binding has a different topography compared to on-target binding, we develop a data-driven approach to identify a topography-driven metric to identify early amyloid accumulation with PET imaging. We test the reproducibility and validity of this metric in a large cohort of adults undergoing amyloid imaging. We then apply this metric to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of early amyloid accumulation in relation to brain metabolism. In parallel to the correlation between amyloid topography and AG in the context of high amyloid burden, our findings suggest that subthreshold, on-target amyloid deposition occurs largely also in high AG regions of the brain.

Materials and methods

Subjects

This study was performed according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants and/or their designated healthcare power of attorney consented to participation in one or more of these studies and for ongoing data analysis, as approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board. Data were gathered from participants enrolled in several different studies at the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center of Washington University in St. Louis. Table 1 lists the cohort characteristics in detail; briefly 622 participants underwent 1024 11C-PIB brain PET scans. At the time of the scans, participant ages ranged from 30 – 100 years, 61% were female, and 13% had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) that was greater than 0, indicating symptomatic AD (a CDR of 0 indicates cognitive normality) (Morris, 1993); 35% of tested participants were also positive for at least one ApoE ε4 allele.

Brain metabolism data is based on previously published studies from our laboratory (Goyal et al., 2017) (Table 2). We independently validated our amyloid topography measure with data from three other 18-fluorine based tracers, namely Florbetapir-F18, 18F-NAV4694, and 18F-FBB (florbetaben), using the data sets detailed in Table 2. Florbetapir-F18 data were acquired from the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center cohort. Among participants who received 11C-PIB brain PET scans, 279 received at least one Florbetapir-F18 scan in successive years. A separate group of 317 participants within the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center also underwent Florbetapir-F18 amyloid PET imaging, giving a total of 736 Florbetapir-F18 imaging visits for analysis. 18F-NAV4694 and 18F-FBB data for two other separate cohorts were downloaded from the Centiloid project’s publically accessible GAAIN repository (http://gaain.org/centiloid-project); demographics for these cohorts are described in further detail elsewhere (Rowe et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2016). The data used for validation included imaging visits from 26 participants for 18F-FBB and 45 participants for 18F-NAV4694.

Amyloid brain PET imaging

For our local cohort, amyloid brain PET imaging was performed either with 11C-PIB (~12 mCi) or Florbetapir-F18 (~10 mCi), injected intravenously as a single bolus followed by 60 (11C-PIB) or 70 (Florbetapir-F18) minutes of brain PET imaging. PET imaging was performed on a Siemens Biograph PET/CT or HR+ scanner. For GAAIN data, amyloid PET was performed with either 18F-NAV4694 (~6.75 mCi) or 18F-FBB (~8.1 mCi) injected intravenously as a single bolus. 18F-NAV4694 scans were collected from the 50–70 min post-inject time window while 18F-FBB scans were collected 90–110 min post-injection. GAAIN scans were acquired on either a Phillips Allegro PET/CT or TF64 PET/CT scanner.

All PET imaging underwent our in-house routine amyloid brain PET processing pipeline that included the following processing steps: framewise motion correction, registration to individual MRI T1 sequences, activity extraction within FreeSurfer v5.3 segmentations based on the Desikan-Killiany Atlas, and partial volume correction using the regional spread function implemented within a geometric transfer matrix framework, as has been described in detail previously (Su et al., 2015; Su et al., 2013; Su et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019). Excluding partial volume correction did not affect our key findings with 11C-PIB; thus, for simplicity only results with partial volume correction are presented here. When scans failed FreeSurfer segmentation, images were inspected, and manual processing was performed when possible. SUVR values were subsequently calculated for each of 42 segmented cortical and deep gray matter regions, referenced to the cerebellar gray matter (i.e., cerebellum SUVR = 1). A mean cortical SUVR (MC-SUVR) was calculated by averaging the SUVR values from prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortical regions. Unless otherwise noted, a threshold MC-SUVR ≥ 1.42 is used to define a quantitatively ‘positive’ amyloid 11C-PIB scan, based on previously published studies (Jack et al., 2017; Mintun et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2015; Su et al., 2013; Vlassenko et al., 2018).

Brain metabolism PET imaging

The metabolic brain PET imaging data were obtained from a previously published study (Goyal et al., 2017). Briefly, 184 PET imaging sessions including 18F-FDG, 15O-O2, 15O-CO, and 15O-H2O were performed in 165 cognitively normal participants and processed to yield regional maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2), total cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRGlc) and AG. For full details of this dataset, please refer to this prior publication (Goyal et al., 2017).

Theory / calculation

An underlying premise in this analysis is that off-target binding by an amyloid tracer will mask on-target binding topography during early and subthreshold stages of amyloid deposition. Simply subtracting a canonical off-target binding pattern from an amyloid scan would not correct for this, since it would depend on estimating the relative quantitative amount of off-target versus on-target binding in that scan—information that we do not have a priori. We therefore apply an alternative approach that utilizes topographic dissimilarity as a means to identify where individual scans lie along a spectrum between an off-target binding pattern versus an on-target binding pattern. Details on this approach follow:

The following analysis was implemented in R (v3.5.2) (2017). Regional SUVR values for each amyloid scan were either analyzed as is or following quantile normalization, as implemented by the ‘normalize.quantiles’ function from the preprocessCore package (Bolstad et al., 2003). Quantile normalization, which is frequently used to normalize gene expression data and to remove batch effects across samples, aims to equalize the statistical distribution of values within each sample, in this case for each amyloid brain PET scan. This is accomplished by calculating mean values for each quantile and then assigning these to each individual scan while preserving the rank order of its regional values (n=42 gray matter regions). Accordingly, exact quantitative values are removed (including MC-SUVR), but relative differences in rank between regions are retained; in effect, this allows one to isolate the topographic differences (or similarities) among scans that might otherwise be masked by significant quantitative differences among them.

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an approach to characterize the relatedness of samples within a dataset in a lower-dimensional configuration. Specifically, MDS projects a dissimilarity matrix based on high dimensional metrics onto a lower dimensional map that aims to preserve the actual distances among samples. MDS was performed by first computing a distance matrix across the amyloid brain PET scans, either before or after quantile normalization. There are numerous possible distance and dissimilarity metrics; in this study we primarily use Euclidean distance due to its intuitive appeal and the mathematical correspondence between metric MDS using Euclidean distances with principal component analysis using correlation matrices. However, we further test our amyloid topography results using other less commonly used distance metrics. All of these distance metrics reflect how the regional topography (quantitative or rank values) of one amyloid scan compares to another: amyloid scans that visually have the same pattern will have low distance/dissimilarity values whereas those that are inverses of one another will have high values. Following computation of the dissimilarity matrix, multidimensional scaling was performed to reduce the dataset to two dimensions, as implemented by cmdscale in the base stats package in R. Adequacy of fit was assessed by calculating a pseudo-R2 for the two-dimensional distances versus the initial higher order distance matrix, with values &gt; 0.80 considered to be adequate.

Together, the analysis above places individual amyloid scans onto a two-dimensional map that reflects the relative dissimilarity among them. The position of these scans along an axis of this map can then be compared to how well the topography of an amyloid scan corresponds to a canonical metabolic topography, including that of AG, CMRGlc, CMRO2, and CBF. This is done by first determining the amyloid to metabolism topography correspondence using Spearman’s rank correlation, and then determining how these correspondences correlate to the dissimilarity index across scans. This thus allows us to probe to what degree each of these metabolic topographies reflects the changing topography of amyloid deposition over time and among individuals, while accounting for the off-target binding of amyloid radiotracers.

Hartigans’ diptest was used to assess whether univariate distributions are unimodal or not (Hartigan, 1985), with p&lt;0.05 considered as evidence that the distribution is likely not unimodal. The main analyses were initially conducted on 11C-PIB data as that was most abundant and subsequently replicated using Florbetapir-F18.

We performed receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the accuracy of using the amyloid topography dissimilarity index (ATDI, defined further below) or MC-SUVR in predicting future ‘conversion’ from a subthreshold MC-SUVR to a suprathreshold MC-SUVR. The area under the curve was calculated for ATDI and MC-SUVR separately for participants who underwent 11C-PIB at least twice over a 3–5 year period and were compared with the a priori prediction that ATDI would outperform MC-SUVR using a paired bootstrap test, as implemented in the roc.test function from the pROC package in R (DeLong et al., 1988; Robin et al., 2011). We performed a similar ROC analysis to compare the amyloid-to-AG topographic correspondence to that of CMRGlc, CMRO2, and CBF in predicting future ‘conversion’ of MC-SUVR from below- to above-threshold values.

Results

Multidimensional scaling of 11C-PIB topography, without and with quantile normalization

Two-dimensional MDS was performed on the 1024 11C-PIB imaging data prior to and after quantile normalization. Prior to quantile normalization (Fig. 1a), the individual PET scans form a two-dimensional structure characterized visually by a cloud of points with an asymmetric extension along both dimensions. The two-dimensional MDS based distances nearly entirely account for the distances in the initial Euclidean distance matrix (pseudo-R2 &gt; 0.99). The first principal coordinate (PCo1) nearly completely correlates with MC-SUVR (MC-SUVR vs PCo1 R2 &gt; 0.99). A histogram of the first principal coordinate (Fig. 1c) demonstrates a unimodal, long-tailed distribution (diptest p ≈ 1). This suggests that without quantile normalization, the global quantitative differences among amyloid scans are well explained by MC-SUVR.

When MDS is performed after quantile normalization of the regional 11C-PIB data, the individual PET scans form a different two-dimensional structure (Fig. 1b), largely characterized by two clouds of points separated along the first principal coordinate (PCo1_qnorm) axis. The two-dimensional distances from this MDS were also highly correlated with the initial distances, though modestly less so when compared to the non-quantile normalized data (pseudo-R2 &gt; 0.88). A histogram of PCo1_qnorm from the quantile normalized data demonstrates it to have a bimodal distribution (Figure 1d, diptest p ≈ 0). The change from unimodality to bimodality with quantile normalization remained when using other metrics to compute the distance matrix (including the Manhattan, Canberra, Pearson, Sorensen, and Jaccard dissimilarity metrics).

The PCo1_qnorm values were rescaled such that the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were set to 0 and 1, respectively; these rescaled values are hereafter referred to as the amyloid topography dissimilarity index (ATDI). MC-SUVR and ATDI values were plotted with respect to age at the time of each scan (Fig. 1e–f). This demonstrates a cloud of low MC-SUVR values from which several individuals at various ages develop rising MC-SUVR values over time. ATDI values also appear to rise at different ages for several of the individuals. However, ATDI values appear to form two independent clouds of values and rises rapidly going from the lower (&lt;0.20) to higher (&gt;0.70) cloud on the order of a few years. Comparing ATDI to MC-SUVR demonstrates ATDI to have more dynamic range when MC-SUVR values are relatively low and less than 1.42 and then plateau at high MC-SUVR values (Fig. 2a).

Longitudinal changes in ATDI

In this dataset, 402 individual 11C-PIB scans were followed by a subsequent 11C-PIB scan in the same individual (time difference between scans: median 3.1 years, SD 1.4 years). Regardless of the time interval between two consecutive scans, paired longitudinal scans were used to calculate an annualized rate of change in ATDI indexed in time to the first of the two scans (Fig. 2b). When plotting change in ATDI as a function of baseline ATDI there is an inverted ‘U’ function, similar to that reported previously for MC-SUVR. The mean rate of change in ATDI increases as the baseline ATDI rises from 0 to 0.5, then subsequently falls back to approximately zero as the baseline ATDI approaches 1.0, corresponding to dynamic evolution of amyloid topography that rapidly changes initially and then plateaus to a stable regional configuration (Fig. 1f).

At ATDI values &gt;0.42, all subsequent ATDI values were higher except when exceeding 0.75 and approaching a plateau near 1.0; thus, ATDI&gt;0.42 indicates a specific threshold for reliable increase in amyloid deposition over time and corresponds to MC-SUVR as low as 1.153. When compared to an MC-SUVR threshold of 1.42, the ATDI threshold of 0.42 identifies 22 additional ‘positive scans’ (Fig. 2a). We then identified pairs of 11C-PIB performed 3–5 years apart, in which the first MC-SUVR was less than 1.42. Among these, 17 had a subsequent MC-SUVR ≥ 1.42 or greater, defined as ‘conversion’, while 160 remained with an MC-SUVR &lt; 1.42. At a threshold of 0.16, ATDI had 87% sensitivity and 88% specificity in predicting conversion at 3–5 years, whereas MC-SUVR had a 79% sensitivity and 82% specificity at a threshold of 1.06 (Fig. 3a). The AUC for ATDI and MC-SUVR to predict conversion after 3–5 years was 0.921 (95% CI 0.829–1.000) and 0.885 (95% CI 0.790–0.978), respectively, but not significantly different from one another (p &lt; 0.08, bootstrap test, paired, one-sided favoring ATDI a priori).

Association of ATDI with brain metabolism topography

We first aimed to reproduce a previously published finding that the spatial pattern of deposition in clearly positive amyloid scans (defined here as ATDI&gt;0.9) correlates with the topography of AG in healthy young adults (20–40 years old) (Vlassenko et al., 2010). Indeed, there is a significant positive topographic correlation between the group averaged positive amyloid scans and young adult AG (Spearman’s ρ=0.72). Interestingly, the correlation between positive amyloid topography and AG topography nominally decreases when the latter is measured in older age groups (40–60 years old: ρ=0.61; 60–82 years old: ρ = 0.57), likely due to at least a proportion of older adults having some degree of hypometabolism due to age and disease (Goyal et al., 2017; Vlassenko and Raichle, 2015). Accordingly, in our subsequent analyses we compare amyloid topography to brain metabolism topography in the younger adult age group, though the overall results remain similar when applied to metabolism computed from the older age groups.

We next aimed to identify potential correlates of what ATDI (i.e., the first principal coordinate identified by MDS of the quantile normalized data) represents — i.e., what is the physiological or metabolic reason for the topographic pattern underlying the early spatiotemporal evolution of amyloid accumulation? We addressed this question by rank correlating the regional topography of each individual amyloid scan with that of brain metabolism and perfusion, specifically AG, total glucose utilization (CMRGlc), oxygen consumption (CMRO2) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Here, for each individual, we calculated a Spearman correlation between the regional gray matter SUVR values of each individual amyloid session (n=1024) and the young adult group-averaged regional topography of each of the four metabolic PET parameters, thus resulting in 4 correlations corresponding to each individual amyloid session (amyloid-AG, amyloid-CMRGlc, amyloid-CMRO2, and amyloid-CBF). As for ATDI and MC-SUVR above, we performed an ROC analysis to determine how well amyloid-AG, amyloid-CMRGlc, amyloid-CMRO2, and amyloid CBF predicted future ‘conversion’ from a negative to positive MC-SUVR. Among these, amyloid-AG predicted this conversion the best (Fig. 3b, AUC = 0.807, 95% CI 0.673–0.942, which was better than amyloid-CMRGlc, -CMRO2, and -CBF, p&lt;0.02 for AG vs CMRGlc, CMRO2, or CBF, bootstrap, paired, one-sided favoring AG a priori).

We then determined how ATDI correlates with each of the four amyloid-metabolism associations. The correlation between ATDI and amyloid-AG correlations was very high throughout the range of ATDI values (Fig. 4a, n=1024, Pearson’s R2=0.95); this result did not change when restricting the data to the first PET scan only from each of the 622 individuals. This suggests that ATDI might largely reflect how well an individual amyloid scan matches the canonical topography of young adult brain AG. For CMRGlc, CMRO2, and CBF the correlations were lower (Fig. 4b, R2=0.73, 0.41, and 0.62, respectively). To further demonstrate that the relationship between ATDI and AG is highest during the early stages of amyloid deposition, we divided the scans into three groups based on ATDI into early (&lt;0.33), middle (0.33–0.66), and late (&gt;0.66) stages. In all three stages, ATDI correlated better with amyloid-AG correspondence than for amyloid-CMRGlc, -CMRO2, and -CBF (Early stage: R2=0.57 vs 0.26, 0.15, 0.22; Middle stage: R2=0.44 vs 0.07, 0.00, 0.04; Late stage: R2=0.74 vs 0.18, 0.04, 0.11, respectively).

Collectively, these results suggest that ATDI—which reflects the principal topographic dissimilarity of amyloid deposition and accumulation over time—is highly and specifically associated with the topography of AG. Note that this is separate from point estimates of amyloid topography and its correlation with metabolism. When the most amyloid has accumulated (i.e., ATDI&gt;0.90), the correlation with AG is strongest (Fig. 4c). Yet, when there is no or minimal amyloid deposition (i.e., ATDI&lt;0.20), the topography of 11C-PIB binding is instead modestly inversely correlated with AG (mean R ≈ −0.34). This indicates that off-target binding of 11C-PIB preferentially occurs in regions with less AG that is subsequently overcome by progressive binding in regions with more AG. Our results now show that even early, subthreshold amyloid accumulation as detected with amyloid imaging occurs preferentially in regions with high AG. Put another way, changes in amyloid topography throughout its spatiotemporal evolution occur along a topographic axis that is best reflected by the regional pattern of AG, as compared to other metabolic topographies.

Separately, in a subset of 96 individuals in whom we had both metabolic and amyloid brain PET data, the correlation between amyloid burden (MC-SUVR) and the degree to which individual amyloid topography correlated with their own AG topography was also high (R2=0.71); i.e., individual amyloid topography more closely resembles individual AG topography as amyloid burden increases. Thus, amyloid accumulation is dictated by a common set of regions underlying both amyloid pathology and AG, both within and across individuals.

Replication of results with Florbetapir-F18

We performed a similar analysis with the Florbetapir-F18 dataset (n=736). As per above, multidimensional scaling was performed on this data before and after quantile normalization. Without quantile normalization, the distribution of the first principal coordinate was unimodal with a long tail (diptest p ≈ 1). In contrast, following quantile normalization, the first principal coordinate distribution was now bimodal (diptest p ≈ 0). An ATDI value was calculated for each Florbetapir-F18 PET session as done previously for the 11C-PIB dataset. Amyloid-AG rank correlations again closely correlated with ATDI values (R2=0.92), while this was less so for CMRGlc, CMRO2, and CBF correlations (R2=0.80, 0.64, and 0.69, respectively).

In a subset of individuals who underwent 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 within one month of each other, ATDI calculated with 11C-PIB correlated with that calculated for Florbetapir-F18 (n=491, Pearson’s R2=0.80, Fig. 5a), suggesting that ATDI can be calculated with different amyloid radiotracers. Multidimensional scaling on a combined quantile normalized dataset comprising both the 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 scans shows that both radiotracers evolve largely in parallel along the first principal coordinate (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, there is increased separation between the 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 along the second principal coordinate (PCo2) for negative scans as compared to positive scans. Unlike the first principal coordinate (PCo1), we are presently unable to identify a specific correlate for the second principal coordinate (PCo2) but this finding might suggest that PCo2 reflects some degree of nonspecific binding as it differs between the two radiotracers.

Finally, we applied multidimensional scaling after quantile normalization to the imaging data from 18F-NAV4694 (n=45) and 18F-FBB scans (n=26), in combination with the results from above. These show that the regional topography of these scans mirror that seen with both 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18, with a cluster of largely negative ATDI values and other largely positive scans (Fig. 5c). In the 45 individuals who underwent both 18F-NAV4694 and 11C-PIB scans, the ATDI values for each correlated with one another very highly (R2=0.97), likely reflecting the chemical similarity between the two radiotracers. The correlation between 18F-FBB and 11C-PIB was slightly more modest, but still very high (n=26, R2=0.92).

Discussion

The topography of amyloid deposition in symptomatic AD has previously been shown to correlate with AG and the default mode network (Buckner et al., 2005; Palmqvist et al., 2017; Vlassenko et al., 2010). However, understanding how early amyloid deposition accumulates could provide important insight into the pathogenesis of AD. Several studies have investigated the topography of early amyloid deposition as assessed with brain amyloid PET imaging (Brier et al., 2016; Driscoll et al., 2012; Grothe et al., 2017; Mattsson et al., 2019; Nordberg, 2004; Sepulcre et al., 2013). Some studies have found that early deposition of amyloid occurs in the hubs of the default mode network (Brier et al., 2016; Palmqvist et al., 2017). More recent studies suggest that amyloid deposition evolves through different stages, each stage representing the involvement of new brain regions (Grothe et al., 2017; Mattsson et al., 2019). Our results suggest that early amyloid accumulation is more simply explained as a transition from an ‘off-target’ binding pattern to an on-target binding pattern that increasingly correlates with the topography of AG. This is then followed by a progressive quantitative increase in amyloid burden in the same regions. The appearance of ‘stages’ of amyloid deposition might reflect this on-target topographic pattern progressively overcoming an initially ‘off-target’ binding pattern, which interestingly has a modestly negative correlation with the topography of AG.

Why does amyloid preferentially accumulate in brain regions with high AG? The role of AG in the human brain is currently not fully understood, but several studies are now revealing its potentially complex and multifaceted functions in the brain. AG has been regionally associated with transcriptional markers of neoteny in the human brain and decreases with typical aging (Goyal et al., 2014; Goyal et al., 2017). AG has been found to be required for activity dependent plasticity and memory formation in vitro and in mice, is associated with synaptic activity, and is heightened by learning tasks (Bas-Orth et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Harris et al., 2019; Harris et al., 2016; Segarra-Mondejar et al., 2018; Shannon et al., 2016).

Interestingly, amyloid precursor protein—the protein precursor for amyloid-beta—is also more highly expressed during the early postnatal period when neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis is highest, and knockout of amyloid precursor protein impairs synaptogenesis (Montagna et al., 2017; Muller et al., 2017; Southam et al., 2019; Tyan et al., 2012). Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that AG, which in the brain may reflect the metabolic needs of task-induced activity, immature synapses and/or synaptic plasticity, might also be associated with higher rates of amyloid precursor protein production and thus with higher risk of amyloid deposition once global changes in proteostasis and amyloid clearance occur (Bufill et al., 2011; Jagust and Mormino, 2011; Kepp, 2019; Vlassenko and Raichle, 2015). Activity-dependent plasticity and related processes, as possibly also reflected by AG, might be another contributing factor to amyloid production and accumulation (Ma et al., 2007). Very recently, a separate study found a modest spatial relationship between normative CBF topography in young adults and amyloid deposition in older adults (Meier et al., 2020). This finding is confirmed in our study here, but we reiterate that the metabolic-amyloid relationship remains higher for AG, which also best predict conversion from ‘negative’ to ‘positive’ MC-SUVR values over 3–5 years. Moreover, CMRO2 showed the smallest correlations with the spatiotemporal dynamics of amyloid deposition, further pointing to the specific relationship between AG and amyloid accumulation.

It is worthy to note that AG-high regions might both be more prone to amyloid deposition and yet more resilient to the effects of amyloid deposition (Newington et al., 2011; Vlassenko et al., 2018). This highlights an important distinction between vulnerability secondary to AG itself versus vulnerability secondary to an underlying physiology that increases both amyloid production and AG. Indeed, the relationships among AG, amyloid accumulation and subsequent neurodegeneration might be close, but are likely complex. Metabolism is not only reflective of activity and plasticity in the brain, but also of that required for homeostasis and clearance mechanisms. Further, the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatics might be important factors in maintaining amyloid clearance (Da Mesquita et al., 2018; Rasmussen et al., 2018). Measures such as ATDI that probe early subthreshold amyloid deposition will be critical to investigating these relationships further.

For negative scans, amyloid topography as assessed with both 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 had a small but persistent negative correlation with AG. This likely reflects off-target radiotracer binding, which appears to be different for 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 when investigated with MDS, yet more similar between 11C-PIB and 18F-NAV4694. The reason for these differences is unclear, but importantly suggests that investigations of early subthreshold amyloid deposition could potentially be confounded when using different amyloid imaging radiotracers.

A strength of this study is the high number of longitudinal amyloid imaging sessions available for our analysis, though additional longitudinal brain metabolism data collection is ongoing. Further, our key findings with 11C-PIB were independently replicated with other amyloid radiotracers. However, our study also has some important weaknesses. Brain metabolism and amyloid imaging was investigated together in only a small subset of these individuals. Topography was defined using an atlas based partly on gyral anatomy rather than cytoarchitectural or functional characteristics. Better cortical parcellation methods, such as those derived from the Human Connectome Project, might be more physiologically relevant for understanding amyloid topography. The ATDI values for 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 were sufficiently different during early accumulation that thresholds for ATDI will likely need to be determined independently for each radiotracer, though calculating ATDI is straightforward and the R code to do so is provided (Supplemental Data). Finally, we acknowledge that amyloid PET imaging does not reflect all of the potentially pathogenic species of amyloid, including those that might be particularly relevant during the earliest stages of amyloid deposition in the brain.

Conclusion

Our findings demonstrate that early, subthreshold spatiotemporal dynamics of amyloid accumulation are largely related to a single factor, defined here as ATDI, which is highly associated with the topography of AG. ATDI might be useful in future studies to more closely identify the onset of amyloid deposition and its relationship to other brain aging and neurodegenerative trajectories—including that of brain metabolism.

Figure 1. Multidimensional scaling of 11C-PIB scans before and after quantile normalization.

Results prior to and after quantile normalization are shown on the left and right, respectively. The 1024 scans prior to and after quantile normalization were submitted to two-dimensional metric multidimensional scaling as described in the text. The resulting points for each scan were plotted according to their first two principal coordinates in (A) and (B). Before quantile normalization, the points map to a dense cloud that spreads out asymmetrically largely along the first principal coordinate (A). The first principal coordinate, which reflects MC-SUVR, has a unimodal long-tailed distribution as shown in (C). In contrast, after quantile normalization, the scans map out into two separate clouds with several points in the middle (B). The first principal coordinate, which is further investigated as a rescaled parameter called the amyloid topography dissimilarity index (ATDI, see text for details) is now bimodal (D). Figures (E) and (F) show longitudinal changes in MC-SUVR (E) and ATDI (F), the latter a rescaled version of the first principal coordinate for the quantile normalized data. Figure (E) shows that MC-SUVR remains close to 1 for a majority of the scans, but for others it rises at different ages with a fairly constant slope. Figure (F) shows that ATDI remains largely below 0.20 for most scans but rises sharply for others until it reaches a second cluster as it approaches 1.0.

Figure 2. ATDI in comparison to MC-SUVR and its change over time.

(A) ATDI is plotted versus MC-SUVR for the 1024 11C-PIB scans. This shows that the dynamic range of ATDI is larger for low MC-SUVR scans and the opposite is true for higher MC-SUVR scans. The red dots indicate scans for which MC-SUVR ≥ 1.42, a previously determined threshold to define 11C-PIB positivity. For MC-SUVR &lt; 1.42, a conservative ATDI threshold of 0.42 (as determined by ‘reliable worsening’ from Fig. 2b) identifies an additional 22 positive cases (orange dots). (B) Among 402 pairs of scans performed sequentially, an annualized change in ATDI was calculated and plotted versus the initial scan ATDI. A loess curve with 99% confidence intervals is fit to this plot. The annualized change in ATDI rises beyond ATDI~0.13, peaks near an ATDI~0.50, and then ATDI plateaus ~1.00. Above ATDI of 0.42, essentially all subsequent 11C-PIB scans had a higher ATDI except when nearing the plateau, suggesting that this represents a conservative threshold of ‘reliable worsening’ for ATDI.

Figure 3. ROC analysis of predictors for amyloid negative-to-positive conversion.

(A) A receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for ATDI (black) and MC-SUVR (orange), in predicting future conversion 3–5 years later from a ‘negative’ MC-SUVR to ‘positive’ (≥1.42, n=17), or remaining ‘negative’ (n=160). This shows that ATDI is moderately accurate in predicting future quantitative positivity, with an AUC of 0.921, sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 88%. In comparison MC-SUVR has a numerically slightly lower AUC of 0.885, sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 82%, but this difference is not statistically significant (p&lt;0.08, one-sided paired bootstrap, favoring ADTI a priori). (B) ROC analysis was similarly performed when using the regional correspondence between the topography of amyloid and that of either AG (red), CMRGlc (blue), CBF (brown), and CMRO2 (green). This demonstrates that the correspondence between amyloid and AG topography best predicts risk of future conversion (AUC 0.807), which was significantly more accurate than that of CMRGlc, CBF and CMRO2 (p&lt;0.02 for all, one-sided paired bootstrap, favoring AG a priori).

Figure 4. ATDI versus aerobic glycolysis (AG).

For each of the 1024 11C-PIB scans, ATDI was calculated and a corresponding correlation between the amyloid topography and normal young adult AG topography was also calculated. These two values are then compared to one another and plotted in (A). This shows that ATDI is very highly correlated with the amyloid-AG topographic correlation (R2 = 0.95), suggesting that ATDI might largely reflect the degree to which amyloid has deposited in high-AG regions. (B) This high correlation is not an artifact of how AG or amyloid topography is calculated since similar analyses using CMRGlc, CMRO2, or CBF maps do not produce as high correlations (R2 = 0.73, 0.41, and 0.62, respectively). Amyloid-metabolism correlations are compared to SUVR as well for comparison. Comparing maps of amyloid topography in very high ATDI cases (ATDI &gt; 0.90) to AG topography in young adults shows them visually to be highly similar (C), with similarly high uptake in frontal regions, the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, and relatively less uptake in the occipital lobe and post central gyrus. However, the correlation in topography between PIB and AG is limited in some regions, such as the anterior cingulate, which shows high PIB uptake yet relatively less AG.

Figure 5. 11C-PIB based ATDI vs Florbetapir-F18 based ATDI.

(A) ATDI when calculated with Florbetapir-F18 is plotted against 11C-PIB based ATDI when the two scans were performed within 1 month of one another. A loess fit with 99% confidence intervals is fit to their relationship, demonstrating that the two ATDI values are highly correlated (R2 = 0.89). (B) Multidimensional scaling was performed after quantile normalization was applied to a combined dataset of all 1024 11C-PIB (red dots) and 736 Florbetapir-F18 scans (blue dots). This maps the scans to left- and right-sided clouds along the first principal coordinate (PCo1), again confirming the bimodality of amyloid topography. For higher PCo1 values, dots from the two scans largely overlap, suggesting that when positive, both 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 demonstrate similar topographies. However, when PCo1 is low, there is a large separation of the points between Florbetapir-F18 and 11C-PIB, suggesting that the topography of nonspecific binding for 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18 significantly differ from one another. (C) Multidimensional scaling after quantile normalization was then also applied to 18F-NAV4694 (green dots, n=45) and 18F-FBB (dark blue dots, n=26) amyloid imaging scans, showing that the regional topography of these scans also overlap that seen with 11C-PIB and Florbetapir-F18.
