Background and Purpose

The presence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the strongest sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) genetic risk factor. We hypothesized that APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers may differ in imaging patterns already in the midlife. We therefore sought to identify the effect of APOE genotype on brain atrophy across almost the entire adult age span using advanced magnetic resonance imaging-based pattern analysis.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed MRI scans of 1,472 participants form the Study of Health in Pomerania (aged 22–90 years). We studied the association between age, APOE ε4 carrier status and brain atrophy, which was quantified using two magnetic resonance imaging-based indices: Spatial Pattern of Atrophy for Recognition of Brain Aging SPARE-BA (summarizing age-related brain atrophy) and SPARE-AD (summarizing AD-like brain atrophy patterns), as well as the gray matter volumes in several AD- and APOE-related regions of interest (lateral frontal, lateral temporal, medial frontal and hippocampus).

Results

No significant association was found between APOE ε4 carrier status and the studied regions of interest or the SPARE indices in linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, and education and including an interaction term between APOE and age.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that measurable APOE related brain atrophy does not occur in early adulthood and midlife and suggests that such atrophy may only occur more proximal to the onset of clinical symptoms of dementia.


Introduction

The presence of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) ε4 allele is the strongest sporadic genetic Alzheimer disease (AD) risk factor1,2. The APOE gene has two additional codominant alleles (APOE ε2 and ε3). These alleles code for the three corresponding apolipoprotein isoforms (ApoE ε2, ε3 and ε4). Compared to individuals with the ε3 allele2, which is the most common in the general population, those with the APOE ε4 allele have higher risk of AD whereas the APOE ε2 allele is associated with lower risk of AD. APOE genotype modifies the age at which cognitively normal subjects present biomarker changes that define AD preclinical stages3,4. There are several mechanisms that have been associated with the influence of APOE ε4 on AD risk: decreased clearance of amyloid from the brain, impaired synaptic plasticity, altered blood brain barrier permeability, immune response and impaired membrane repair following neuronal injury5–7. In line with these results neuropathological studies have shown that plaques and tangles mediate APOE related clinical changes8. ApoE is present in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but there is a weak correlation between ApoE concentrations within these two compartments9,10. In APOE genotype adjusted models, CSF, but not plasma, ApoE levels are associated with cognitive changes and brain atrophy9. Nevertheless, a large longitudinal study reported associations with plasma ApoE levels that dropped to borderline significance when adjusted for APOE genotype11.

Most APOE related findings regarding brain structure have been reported in elderly subjects. However, due to the long AD preclinical stage it could be expected that subtle neuroimaging changes may appear at younger ages and become more pronounced with advancing age. In line with this hypothesis there is limited information regarding associations related to brain structural changes and APOE genotype in younger subjects. Previous studies have reported lower hippocampal, orbitofrontal and entorhinal volumes in APOE ε4 subjects in the first decades of life12,13. Other studies have shown brain hypometabolism in AD-related areas14 and increased activation of the default mode network15 in young APOE ε4 carriers but no differences in grey matter volume. The aforementioned changes reported in these studies would be taking place over 3 decades before the ages that show at least 1% AD prevalence, which suggests that AD could have a neurodevelopmental component. However, the relation between regional brain atrophy and the APOE genotype needs to be evaluated across the adult lifespan.

We hypothesize that APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers could present different imaging patterns that start differing in midlife, much earlier than clinical diagnosis. To investigate this hypothesis we sought to model structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain changes associated with the APOE genotype in a large population-based study spanning from the third to the ninth decades of life using sensitive pattern-based aging and AD summary indices.

Materials and Methods

Participants from SHIP

The Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) is a prospective cohort whose subjects are recruited from the general population of the German State Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. It is led by the Institute for Community Medicine at the Medical Faculty of the University of Greifswald16. SHIP started at baseline with SHIP-0 between 1997 and 2001. After about 5 years, all participants were re-invited for a follow-up visit i.e. SHIP-1. From 2008 to 2012 the second follow-up examination SHIP-2 was carried out. Concurrent with SHIP-2, a new population sample from the same area was drawn and similar examinations were undertaken between 2008 and 2012 (SHIP-TREND). SHIP-2 and SHIP-TREND included whole-body MRI scans17, which were not present in SHIP-0 and SHIP-1. Trained certified radiologists, each with more than 5 years MRI interpretation experience, visually inspected head MRI scans for artifacts and clinical findings. In our study, we included 1472 subjects out of the total of 3256 subjects with T1-weighted brain scans available in SHIP 2 and SHIP Trend, aged 22–90 years at enrolment. We excluded 1602 subjects from this analysis based upon: 1) presence of stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, cerebral tumor, intracranial cyst or hydrocephalus (n=150), 2) high level of motion artifacts (n=98), 3) failed quality control of the automatically skull-stripped data (n=121), 4) lack of genome wide association study data (n=1008), 5) not identifiable APOE genotyping (n=35) and 6) lack of clinical data (cognitive scores n=190, or covariates; n=182).

Clinical data, including socio-demographic factors and medical history, were collected in a standardized computer assisted face-to-face interview. Years of education were recorded and grouped into three categories: &lt;8 years, 8–10 years, and &gt;10 years. In SHIP two cognitive tests were obtained: the Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT, the German version of the California verbal learning and memory test18) for SHIP-2 and the Nurnberg Age Inventory (NAI) for SHIP-Trend. NAI is a German test developed to measure the cognitive abilities during brain aging19. It consists of subtests including, but not limited to, speed- (e.g. numbers) and memory (e.g. words, numbers and images) tests. A description of the final SHIP sample included in our analysis (n=1472) is shown in table 1. The Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Greifswald approved SHIP.

Image acquisition

In SHIP-2 and SHIP-Trend a comprehensive whole body MRI protocol is present. A full description of the image acquisition parameters have been described in Hegenscheid et al for SHIP17. The neurocranium unit of SHIP included among others a T1-weighted and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Briefly, all images were obtained using a 1.5 Tesla Siemens MRI scanner (Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). We used in this study only the T1-weighted axial MPRAGE images for measuring regional patterns of AD-related brain atrophy. The T1-weighted image was acquired with the following parameters: 1×1 mm in-plane spatial resolution, slice thickness =1.0 mm (flip angle 15°), TE =3.4 ms and TR =1900 ms.

Image processing

An automated multi-atlas segmentation method was applied on the T1-weighted image of each subject to calculate a brain mask for each subject, by removing extra-cranial material on the T1-weighted image20. Total intra-cranial volume was estimated by calculating the volume of a subject’s brain mask, which included the volumes of grey matter, white matter, ventricles, and the cerebrospinal fluid, that were contained within the outer brain boundary. Each brain mask was visually inspected for quality, by M. H., and all masks rated with low quality brain mask (including either under- or over segmented brain) were excluded.

A multi-atlas label fusion based segmentation method21 was applied for segmentation of the brain into a set of anatomical regions of interest (ROI). The volumes of ROIs were calculated and were normalized by total intra-cranial volume. In this analysis, we selected a set of gray matter ROIs based on areas that were associated with AD-related atrophy and previously reported APOE related findings. Further details are given in the Supplementary Online Data (Online method 1).

MRI Pattern Classification

A pattern classification method was previously proposed to derive Spatial Pattern of Abnormality for Recognition of Early AD (SPARE-AD)22, an index summarizing the high dimensional imaging data with a single value that quantifies the atrophy patterns in AD-related regions. SPARE-AD has been shown to discriminate between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)23 and with conversion from MCI to AD24. We calculated in this study the SPARE-AD index for the SHIP population using a linear support vector machines25 based model, which was trained on the external training dataset described in24 and has been validated earlier22. More positive SPARE-AD implies more Alzheimer disease-like brain structure, while more negative values reflect more normal-like brain structure.

Similar to the calculation of the SPARE-AD index, a linear support vector machines based model, was designed to predict an individual’s age from the MR scan and was used for quantifying the Brain Aging (BA), summarized by the SPARE-BA index. The classification model was trained for optimally discriminating between young and old subject groups and has been recently described26,27. The SPARE-BA index for an individual implied less brain aging patterns for higher (positive) values and the presence of more aging related atrophy patterns for lower (negative) values. While the SPARE-AD index captured more localized atrophy patterns in AD related regions, such as in the hippocampus and temporal lobe, the SPARE-BA index captured more global aging patterns, distributed in the cortex, but particularly in the frontal lobe. Further details are given in the Supplementary Online Data (Online method 2)

APOE determination in SHIP

The APOE genotypes were determined based on rs429358(C;C) and rs7412(T;T) from the resulting imputation of the SHIP genotyping. More details can be found in the Supplementary Online Data (Online method 3).

Statistical Analysis

We studied the association between age, APOE ε4 genotype and AD-related gray matter volume (lateral frontal, lateral temporal, medial frontal and hippocampus), as well as, SPARE-AD and SPARE-BA, for the 1,472 SHIP participants included in this study. We considered in this study subjects with at least one ε4 allele to be APOE ε4.

We applied linear regression models, which included total intra-cranial volume normalized ROI volumes as outcomes and age, APOE ε4 carrier status, gender as predictors adjusting for education level and study cohort. We also investigated the significance of interaction terms between APOE ε4 status and the variables: age2, age, education and gender after including those interaction terms one at a time to the regression models as predictors. Results were considered statistically significant if the two-sided p-value was &lt;0.05. No multiple comparison adjustment was applied because analyses were performed on a small number of predictors that were selected based on previous published findings rather than determined based on the data derived herein. To identify potentially cognitively impaired subjects based on the residuals of linear regressions between age and the available cognitive scores, those subjects with a z-score&lt;-1.5 standard deviations were labeled as possibly cognitively impaired (n=98)(Supplementary Online Figure 1). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were used to assess correlations between variables. Student’s t-test was used to compare continuous variables and Pearson’s chi squared test to compare categorical variables. Analyses were performed using R software v3.128.

Results

Subjects included in the study

A total of 1,472 participants, from which 744 belonged to SHIP-2 and 728 belonged to SHIP-Trend, with ages ranging from 22 to 90 years (median 53.3 years) were included in the analyses. Cohorts did not differ in gender but significant differences were present with respect to education level (p&lt;0.001), age (p&lt;0.0001) and the number of APOE ε4 carriers (p=0.03). There were no differences between subjects included in the study and those who were excluded, based on the inclusion criteria described in the methods section, except for gender (Supplementary Online Table 1).

Association between the SPARE indices and age

The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was r=0.36 between age and SPARE-AD, and was r=−0.77 between age and SPARE-BA (p&lt;0.001). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between SPARE-AD and SPARE-BA was r=−0.44 (p&lt;0.001).

Association between APOE and MRI findings

Figure 1 shows the relationship between the AD-related gray matter regions and age within APOE ε4 carrier and non-carrier individuals. Similarly, Figure 2 shows the relationship between the SPARE indices and age. In age and gender adjusted models that included the interaction term between APOE and age, no significant association was found between APOE ε4 carrier status and the studied MR imaging measurements, in the regression models that included the ROI volumes or the SPARE indices as outcomes (Table 2). Similarly, there was no significant interaction between APOE ε4 carrier status and age (p&gt;0.1). In all models, older age was associated with greater brain atrophy and a nonlinear square age term was significant for the models that included lateral temporal regions, hippocampus or SPARE-AD scores as outcomes (Table 2). Besides age, male participants showed smaller regional volumes, higher SPARE-AD and lower SPARE-BA values over the studied lifespan. In additional analyses limiting the sample to younger (age 22–40 years) or older (age 60 to 90) participants, we did not find any APOE genotype-related differences (Supplementary Online Table 2–3).

Association between APOE and cognitive scores

No significant association was detected between VLMT, NAI and APOE ε4 carrier status in a linear regression model after adjusting for age, gender and education (Supplementary Online Tables 4–5).

Discussion

Although APOE ε4 allele is the strongest sporadic genetic AD risk factor accounting for most of AD genetic-related risk and is associated with an earlier clinical onset of dementia and preclinical biomarker changes, we did not find brain volume differences between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers,

Here we studied the association between the APOE genotype and brain structure in a large cohort of subjects with a wide age range recruited from the general population, whose MRI scans were obtained using a standardized sequence in all subjects. We quantified structural brain changes using two approaches: (1) a ROI approach, guided by previous findings, and (2) a pattern based analysis using two machine learning-based summary indices. The imaging indices, the SPARE AD and the SPARE BA, were developed to quantify AD- and age-related brain changes, respectively. SPARE AD has been shown to predict early AD-related changes23 and MCI stages24. The SPARE AD index outperformed ROI defined volumes in detecting the earliest changes associated with initial cognitive symptoms and showed that one single brain volume measure alone is unlikely to adequately reflect the complexity of neurodegeneration in AD, as previously demonstrated in Fan et al.29 Therefore, it is unlikely that a lack of sensitivity of our approaches can explain the absence of associations between APOE and the structural MRI measures.

The difference in SPARE-AD scores of APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers was statistically insignificant. Our results indicate that APOE related MRI atrophy is not prominent at younger ages and suggest that atrophy may only be observable more proximal to the onset of clinical symptoms. Whereas older subjects with more severe degrees of cognitive impairment might be underrepresented in our population-based sample, thus also leading to an underrepresentation of APOE ε4 carriers in the elderly (21.9% APOE ε4 carriers among the older than 60 years old individuals), this would have not been the case for the younger subjects (27.0% APOE ε4 carriers among the younger than 40 years old individuals). Therefore we would not expect any recruitment bias to explain the lack of observed associations in the younger individuals included in our study.

Our findings agree with studies following cognitively normal subjects with autosomal dominant mutations with an expected age at onset of disease, which report structural MRI changes taking place within one decade or less from the diagnosis of dementia30,31. In addition, recent CSF and autopsy biomarker studies have shown that amyloid deposition starts in the 5th decade3,32, usually without having positive amyloid scans. Based on the current AD biomarker33 model, that predicts occurrence of Aβ deposition before brain atrophy, it would be unlikely to find brain atrophy already in the 3rd decade of life.

Previous studies have reported lower hippocampal, orbitofrontal and entorhinal volumes in APOE ε4 subjects in early decades of life12,13. The possible reasons for conflicting results could be differences in selection of the sample, the sample size or processing pipelines of the MRI scans. Another potential explanation is that negative results are less likely to be reported than positive results. Our study included a similar, or even larger, sample size than previous studies and applied sensitive methods to detect even subtle MRI changes associated with early AD-related changes and aging. However, it is possible that differences in functional changes associated with APOE genotype at younger age, as reported previously, precede structural changes14,15 and potentially even widespread Aβ deposition, albeit this hypothesis still requires larger samples to validate initial reports based on small size cohorts.

In recent work, AD pathology from preclinical to clinical stages was associated with decrease in the metabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex even before any sign of AD34. The appearance of hypometabolism prior to clinical change could vary depending on cognitive reserve. The results on cognitive reserve and APOE are controversial in the literature. However APOE does not seem to modulate the effect of cognitive reserve on cognitive function35. Due to the lack of functional imaging measures in our cohort we could not evaluate the presence of these changes in the framework of SHIP.

While we did not find associations between APOE and brain volume measures, several studies report effects of APOE genotype on white matter microstructure, which we did not assess in the current study. APOE was associated with white matter microstructure in 2 out of 14 tracts in elderly persons free of dementia and preclinical dementia36. Furthermore, APOE ε4 was associated with decline in fractional anisotropy, a marker for white matter integrity, compared to non-carriers37. On the other hand, APOE ε2 carriers had more robust white matter integrity38. The mechanisms underlying the white matter microstructural changes are still not well understood39, but it is possible that detection of more subtle associations between APOE and brain structure in preclinical dementia require microstructural assessment.

Limitations of our study include: the use of imputed genotype data from SNP arrays and not using a specific assay for APOE genotype40 to determine the APOE genotype, the limited clinical testing data available for the subjects and the lack of longitudinal MRI scans.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that measurable APOE related brain atrophy does not occur during early adulthood and midlife and suggests that APOE related MRI atrophy may only be present later in life, more proximal to clinical disease onset.
