Background/Objectives:

Identify the regions with highest/lowest Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) mortality across the U.S. at state/county levels and evaluate its contribution to the differences in total mortality rates between these regions. Quantitatively describe the disease, disease group, sex, race/ethnicity and place-of-death-related inter-region differences that engender the disparity in mortality. Test the hypothesis that inter-regional differences in filling out death certificates are a major contributor to differences in AD mortality.

Design:

Retrospective evaluation of death certificate data.

Setting:

U.S.

Participants:

Deceased U.S. residents, 1999–2018.

Methods:

Region-specific age-adjusted mortality rates and group-specific rate decomposition.

Results:

The county clusters with the highest/lowest AD-mortality rates were in WA/NY, respectively, with other notable high-mortality clusters on the border of TN, GA and AL as well as in ND and SD. These patterns were stable over the 1999–2018 period. AD had the highest contribution to total mortality difference between WA and NY (156%, higher in WA), in contrast circulatory diseases had a contribution of comparable magnitude (154%) but were higher in NY. Differences in cause-of-death certificate coding, either through coding of non-AD dementias, or other conditions accompanying a potential AD-death could not account for differences in AD mortality between NY and WA.

Conclusions:

Inter-regional differences in filling out death certificates were not a major contributor to variation in AD mortality between the regions with the highest and lowest rates. The respective mitigation of the effects of neural and circulatory diseases and several other high-impact conditions would not negate the disparity in mortality between NY and WA.

Introduction

Over 40 million people are estimated to suffer from dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to triple by the year 2050.1 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for up to 80% of dementia cases diagnosed in the U.S., with associated healthcare costs approaching $215 billion a year.2 However, this burden is not equally distributed across the U.S.––significant geographic disparities exist in AD-related mortality3–9. Furthermore, despite the considerable attention given to this problem, the underlying cause(s) of this phenomenon cannot be named with certainty and there exists a paucity of longitudinal epidemiologic studies on this subject. Those studies that do exist, have largely focused on AD exclusively, excluding Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) and similar conditions which can both co-exist with and confound the presence of AD. Complicating the problem is the wide range of disparate data types used to obtain epidemiologic measurement leading to a lack of comparability between studies.

The purpose of this study is twofold. First, using Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) data, we provide a detailed state/county-level description of the variation in AD-mortality rates across the U.S., identify regions that demonstrate exceptionally high or low AD-mortality rates when compared to the rest of the U.S., and assess whether the presence of these regions is stable over the 1999–2020 period. Second, we explore the differences between two regions characterized by the highest and lowest U.S.-wide AD-mortality rate. Specifically, we assess the relative contribution of AD and dementia-related diseases to the total difference in all-cause mortality between the regions in comparison to the contributions of other diseases/disease groups and identify the possible causes of the inter-region differences in AD-mortality. Our main hypothesis is that a significant proportion of the observed geographic disparities in AD-mortality identified through analysis of MCD data can be explained by differences in the way local physicians fill out death certificates. Therefore, there exists either a single dementia-related disease, or disease group which, when combined with AD, will either greatly reduce or completely remove the differences in AD-mortality between the two geographic regions. Finally, we test a supplemental hypothesis that these coding differences, if present, may also differ across gender, race/ethnicity and urban/rural residence -related subgroups as well as by the location (e.g. hospital, nursing facility, private home) of where the death occurred.

Methods

The MCD database, contains mortality and population counts for the U.S. derived from official death certificates and aggregated at the county level. It provides information on a single underlying cause of death and up to twenty additional secondary causes categorized using 4-digit international classification of disease 10th edition (ICD-10) codes as well as basic demographic data. We used MCD data provided by the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) Wonder10 tool to evaluate race- and geographic area-specific age-adjusted mortality rates 65+ for the 1998–2018 period. Details on the calculation of age-adjusted rates can be found in Supplementary Methodological Remark 1.

The difference between geographic area-specific age-adjusted rates was then further decomposed by the contributions of specific causes of death. Since Rate=∑dRated, where d enumerates different causes of death, the difference between two age-adjusted rates is D≡Rate(1)−Rate(2)=∑d(Rated(1)−Rated(2))≡∑dDd. The specific cause of death contributes to the total difference between the rates under comparison as rd=Dd/D, and ∑drd=1 (or 100%). The disease specific contributions rd can be both positive, when the cause-specific rate is higher in area (1) and negative, when the opposite is true. Two categorizations of available causes of death were used: i) ICD-10 disease Chapters and ii) ICD-10-specific causes of death as defined by CDC-Wonder.

The specific contribution of a disease, rd, was then further decomposed for area-specific subpopulations using the following formula: rsd=Rated(1)Ps(1)Ptot(1)−Rated(2)Ps(2)Ptot(2)

Thus, for a population stratified into S subgroups, a cause-of-death specific contribution rd is decomposed into contributions coming from population subgroups: rd=∑srsd. Again, subgroup-specific contributions, rsd, can be positive or negative depending on the relative sizes of the group-specific rates in areas (1) and (2). The relative contributions rsd can clarify which population subgroup is more (or less) important for explaining the relative contributions rd. We used the following independent stratifications of the total population 65+: i) four racial groups (White American (WA), African American (AA), Asian American (AA), and Native American (NA)), ii) Hispanic origin, iii) gender, iv) place of death (inpatient, home, nursing home), and v) urban/rural residence.

Based on the above methods a four-step analysis plan was designed. Specifically, i) provide a state/county-level description of the variation of AD-mortality rates across the U.S. and identify state-level regions with abnormally high/low values over the 1999–2018 period; ii) compare the differences in the values and age structure of AD-mortality rates to the differences in total mortality to see the relative contribution of AD-mortality to the total and the role of other disease groups; iii) quantify which diseases and/or disease groups are responsible for the disparity and whether these contributions differ across age, gender, race/ethnicity, residence status and place-of-death; iv) explore the extent to which differences in cause-of-death coding practices can account for the observed differences in AD-mortality rates.

Results

County-specific AD-mortality rates averaged over the 1999–2018 period are presented in Figure 1. They show that although there is geographic variation in AD mortality across the U.S., the nature of this variation is not as clear-cut as studies aggregating such data at the HHS level may suggest11. Washington State (WA) demonstrated the single highest well-defined hotspot with a large number of adjacent counties all sharing the highest level of AD-mortality observed across the U.S. of more than 300 deaths per 100,000. The US Old South (Tennessee, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and parts of Texas) showed the next highest concentrations of high-level AD-mortality. However, the affected counties were more spread out across the states with the single largest concentration being around a three-state border area between Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. Finally, North Dakota and to a lesser extent South Dakota demonstrated two relatively small hotspots of high AD-mortality. The States of New York (NY) and Florida stood out as states with exceptionally low rates of AD-mortality when compared to their neighbor-states. These patterns did not change in response to including all causes of death from the multiple cause of death list as opposed to using only the underlying cause. At the state level, the state with the highest and lowest AD-mortality rates were WA and NY respectively, with these differences persisting over the 1999–2018 period (Supplementary Figure S1), therefore these two states were selected for further analysis. Of note is that although the differences between AD death rates in WA and the five closest states decreased since 2014, this was due to a sharp increase in the AD-related mortality rates in the five closest states rather than due to improvements in AD-related mortality in WA. A comparison of mortality rates associated with major disease clusters (Supplementary Table S1) showed that although many disease clusters had comparable levels of magnitude between NY and WA, diseases of the nervous system, although comparable in overall rank (5th in NY; 4th in WA) demonstrated mortality rates almost 3 times larger in WA (457 vs. 155 per 100,000).

Age-adjusted (65+) rates of total mortality (per 100,000) for the 1999–2018 period in NY and WA were 4,181 (CI: 4,175–4,186) and 4,374 (CI: 4,364–4,384) respectively. Mortality rates for AD as an underlying case were 82 (CI: 81–83) and 327 (CI: 324–330), in NY and WA respectively. The associated between-state differences in mortality were 193 per 100,000 for total and 245 per 100,000 for AD-related, with WA demonstrating the higher rates in both categories. The 1st column in Table 1 shows the contributions of underlying cause-of-death sections to the total disparity in mortality (sum of all sections is 100% corresponding to the 193 per 100,000 disparity) between NY and WA. Diseases of the nervous system (ICD-10 G00-G98) were the leading contributors (e.g. acting to increase the mortality rate in WA) to the geographic disparities in total mortality (156%) which was almost fully offset (e.g. acting to increase the mortality rate in NY and therefore decreasing the WA/NY difference in total mortality) by diseases of the circulatory systems (ICD-10 I00-I99; −154%). The absolute values of the contributions of these two groups were individually higher than the total difference between total mortality in these two states, but when taken together they contributed 156–154=2% to the total difference in mortality. Thus, these two Sections characterize the differences in the structure of causes of death between WA and NY. A comparison of the age-specific mortality for these two disease clusters (Figure 2) showed that diseases of the circulatory system were characterized by a small but persistent difference across all age groups. On the other hand, diseases of the nervous system were characterized by a relatively large gap which slowly increased in magnitude at older ages (approximately after age 70). NY had other categories where it showed a higher proportion of deaths summing up to a further −41%, these were not as influential either individually or combined. On the other hand, the combined effect of other causes of death for WA summed to a further +140 percentage points (pp); this is almost as much as the contribution of the primary effect––diseases of the nervous systems. The most prominent of these were neoplasms (32%), external causes (30%), as well as diseases of the endocrine, nutritional and metabolic (28%), respiratory (25%) and digestive (15%) systems.

The stratified effects of subgroup specific contributions, rsd, are shown in columns 2–14 of Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2. Concentrating on the primary contributor for NY (e.g. circulatory systems), we see that higher NY mortality is primarily concentrated in AA (−110pp of −154%) and Whites (−55pp of −154%) while for other races mortality from this group of diseases is actually lower in NY than WA. The magnitude of this effect is more pronounced in non-Hispanics (−99pp) than Hispanics (−55pp) and Females (−112pp) than Males (−42pp). Most of this disparity is driven by inpatient deaths (−176pp) which is consistent with the nature of the disease. As expected, after stratifying by place of residence (Supplementary Table S2) contributions of this category increases to −328pp for urban (given the highly urbanized nature of the NY population this is expected) and +174pp for rural (given the more rural nature of WA this is also expected). Decomposition of the primary contributor for WA (e.g. nervous systems) shows that racially, the entire effect was due to the contribution of White Americans (151pp out of 156%) of non-Hispanic origin (158pp out of 156%) with a greater proportion of females (89pp) to males (67pp). Finally, most of this effect occurs due to death certificates filled out in nursing homes (120pp out of 156%). Contributions of urban vs rural residence to the total disparity in nervous system mortality were comparable in magnitude (69 and 87pp out of 156%, respectively).

Contributions of individual causes of death that explain more than 10% of the disparity in total mortality are displayed in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S3. Atherosclerotic heart disease (I25.1; −206%) was overwhelmingly higher in NY, driving the size of disparity in mortality between NY and WA down. This individual effect was significantly higher than for diseases of the circulatory system as a group (−154pp). This is because some members of this category, notably stroke (I64; 28%) had higher rates in WA. In agreement with Table 1, Alzheimer’s disease unspecified (G30.9; 123%) was the primary disorder with higher cause-specific mortality in WA accounting for most of the effect of the diseases of the nervous system category (156%). Of interest is the way the mental and behavioral disorders (−9%) category breaks down: unspecified dementia (F03; −31%) was the second largest contributor with higher mortality rates in NY, however vascular dementia (F01.9; 12%), an AD-related dementia, demonstrated higher rates in WA. Therefore, the addition of vascular dementia, the most prevalent type of ADRD to AD was not able to explain the difference in AD mortality between the two states. Overall, the sum of all individual causes of death with an impact of 10% or more accounted for −56% of the disparities in mortality between NY and WA. That is, if the diseases in Table 2 were the only factors affecting the differences in mortality rates between NY and WA, then the mortality differential between NY and WA would flip with NY having the higher, and WA the lower rate. Therefore, 156% of the remaining difference is accounted for by minor differences (&lt;10%) spread out across a wide range of individual contributions of other diseases, rather than the effect of one or several single condition(s). The subgroup-specific stratified, findings were consistent with those discussed in Table 1.

Discussion

Our study showed significant gaps in all-cause and AD-related mortality across the U.S. The highest and lowest rates were observed in WA and NY, respectively. The identified patterns were stable over the 1999–2018 period. Our assessments of the geographic patterns of AD mortality are consistent with previous analyses of geographic disparities in AD/ADRD incidence12, prevalence13, and mortality3 which detected considerable geographic variations in these measures. Kirson at al.12 found that statistical regression-based models with demographic, socioeconomic, and access-to-care/quality-of-care predictors can explain a maximum of 30% of the variation in the observed rates of incident AD diagnoses. Gillum et al.3 documented the difference between WA and NY in AD mortality and suggested several mechanisms of generating such disparities involving variations of risk factor diseases, interactions between their incidence, survival, diagnostic practice and completion of death certificates for future research. Both studies3,12 underlined a paucity of knowledge on the determinants of these geographic variations/disparities across U.S. including the difference between WA and NY.3 In addition, Lehrer14 compared AD and malignant brain tumor age-adjusted mortality rates for the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia in persons age 65+ and detected many similarities between the two distributions. This suggests that environmental and/or gene-environment interaction effects may be at fault, since adult malignant brain tumors have been proposed to share several environmental risks15 and genetic risk factors with AD16. Additionally, indirect support for this hypothesis is presented in several studies showing that geographic clusters of AD mortality in the USA17 were associated with environmental risk factors such as the concentration of selenium in soil18 or the levels of ionizing radiation19.

We first hypothesized that the differences in total mortality could be due to differences in health outcomes associated with several individual disease groups rather than a uniform disparity across all categories We found that circulatory diseases (154%; higher in NY) were the primary contributors to the differences in total mortality, comparable in magnitude to the contribution of diseases of the nervous system including Alzheimer’s Disease (156% higher in WA). Furthermore, differences in mortality associated with race/ethnicity, location of death and place of residence were a major factor in describing differences in both total and disease-group-related mortality. We found that, when ranked by individual cause of death, only two individual conditions (1st rank: atherosclerotic heart disease, −206% higher in NY; 3rd rank: Alzheimer’s Disease, 123% higher in WA) could be identified as well-defined targets for potential public health intervention with the 4th most significant effect (unspecified dementia, 31% higher in NY) lagging far behind in magnitude. Second in rank was a composite measure of all diseases (156% higher in WA) with an impact of &lt;10%. This demonstrates that even if the high-impact conditions were accounted for, there would still be a notable disparity in mortality between NY and WA due to, inherent structural (e.g. in the results of differences in capacity, number and quality of healthcare provision systems and/or prevailing practice and coding habits) differences between the two states.

When dealing with disparities in AD-related mortality, we found that in addition to AD-mortality rates in 1999–2018 being significantly lower in NY than in WA, there was also a group of diseases that showed similar inter-region differences. For example, stroke and its sequelae, Parkinson’s disease, vascular dementia, falls, etc. These diseases could share some potential risk factors and disease mechanisms. Among those diseases were diseases whose lower mortality could be viewed as an indirect characteristic of more effective medical care in the region: e.g., lower mortality from stroke sequelae or external causes of morbidity and mortality could potentially suggest more effective medical care in NY compared to WA; however, lower mortality rates for septicemia and chronic ischemic heart disease in WA would run counter to such a general conclusion.

Then, we tested a hypothesis that a purely administrative cause such as the differences in death certificate coding habits between U.S. regions could substantially contribute to the inter-regional disparities in AD mortality. This hypothesis, if true would imply that conditions with symptomology similar to AD are being entered in death certificates instead of AD thus decreasing the observed rate of cause-specific AD mortality. Therefore, if mortality rates reported for all such conditions are lumped together into a single composite category, the difference would be mitigated. Some evidence in support of this hypothesis can be seen with the way non-AD dementia is being coded. Rates of vascular dementia, an AD-related dementia, follow the same pattern as AD with higher rates recorded in WA. However, unspecified dementia-related deaths are both higher in NY and the 4th largest contributor to disparities in mortality. In our study, we found that, even when combined, the effects of other dementias could not counteract the effect of AD alone (3rd strongest overall effect on total mortality), especially since many other dementia types (e.g. vascular dementia) shared the overall disparity pattern exhibited by AD. This is in accordance with other studies which found that the fraction of dementia unspecified diagnoses is higher in NY comparing to WA, but the total rate (AD + dementia unspecified) in NY is still lower than in WA3. Repeating the analyses using multiple causes of death showed that incorporating secondary causes of death does not change these conclusions.

Finally, is possible that when a patient with AD dies because of another condition (e.g., mechanical asphyxia caused by suffocation by saliva) in some states such a death would be coded using AD as the underlying cause while in other states it could be coded as asphyxia (ICD-10 code R09.01) or respiratory arrest (ICD-10 code R09.2) instead. Our analysis shows, that although the differences (excesses) in mortality rates of these conditions in WA were observed, the rates are too small to contribute to the reduction of the fraction of AD in the total disparities. For example, the mortality rate of asphyxia is 0.54 in NY and 0.10 in WA, and the rate of respiratory arrest is 2.74 in NY and 0.54 in WA. Thus, respiratory arrest can offset −1.1% of the disparity in total mortality, which is negligible when compared to the contribution of AD (123%). The group of diseases under ICD-10 section ‘R’, that combined similar symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings actually increase rather than compensate for the effect of the total AD disparity by 3% of the total disparity.

This study was unable to fully explain the causes of geographic variance in total and AD-related mortality across the U.S. Further progress in the analyses of geographic disparities can be made through analysis of survey (such as Health and Retirement Study) and/or electronic health records for elderly populations (such as Medicare data) linked to MCD data to test whether the patterns observed in MCD data can be predicted by incidence-based mortality for a specific disease and if other disease-related factors such as competing risk from cardiovascular diseases or other conditions contribute to final cause of mortality documented on the death certificates. Interconnections between these types of data for AD/ADRD outcomes were recently studied20,21. Stokes et al.21 for example, demonstrated that routine mortality statistics may underestimate the mortality burden associated with dementia. Therefore, the geographic disparities found in MCD data should be reproduced when incidence-based mortality calculated from Medicare records is used. Involvement of Medicare records could identify possible disparities in AD incidence12 and survival22, which can be analyzed through partitioning23–27, and can be used to track the health status of individuals involved in cross-state migration. Further research on the role of differences in modifiable behavioral risk factors, co-morbidity treatment choice and chronic disease management adherence patterns as well as the joint effects of these variables together with previously studied risk factors on the size of these disparities is needed to shed further light on the causes of the problem.

1 In percentage points; Negative contribution indicates that mortality from that death section is higher in New York; Positive Contribution indicates that mortality from that section is higher in Washington.

2 Each group adds up to the total contribution (minor discrepancies due to rounding and negligible contributions of &lt;0.5%). Positive and negative values interpreted as in footnote 1.

3 The balance (e.g. +156 percentage points for total) is accounted for by negligible individual contributions (e.g. &lt;0.5%) of all other diseases.

Key Points:

Inter-regional differences in cause-of-death coding practices were not a significant contributor to differences in AD-mortality.

Alzheimer’s Disease was the highest contributor to the total mortality difference between WA and NY (156%, higher in WA), in contrast to the second highest contributor, circulatory diseases (154%) which were higher in NY.

Focus on high-impact contributors to the differences in total mortality (circulatory and Alzheimer’s Disease) is insufficient to negate the differences, as the second highest contributor was a composite measure of minute contributions of multiple diseases.

Why Does This Paper Matter: A U.S.-wide state/county-level description of the variation in Alzheimer’s-related Mortality and its role in generating differences in total mortality is provided and explained in terms of coding practice, cause-of-death, sex, race/ethnicity and place-of-death-related inter-regional differences.
