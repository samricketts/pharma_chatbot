pmcAt the time this work was conducted (2007-2008) the research use of CSF biomarker proteins linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hallmarks--β-amyloid (Aβ) plaque load and tau pathology (Aβ42, t-tau, p-tau181)--was becoming established practice amongst a number of experienced laboratories as reliable and accurate indices of brain pathology in living subjects (1-3). These studies mainly used either a widely employed ELISA methodology (4) or the newer (at the time) micro-bead based xMAP immunoassay format, developed by Innogenetics (now Fujirebio) (5). The data generated from more than 25 studies that used these techniques and CSF provided strong support for a more objective measurement of amyloid and tau pathology in living individuals, compared to clinical diagnosis of AD dementia (6). Clinical diagnosis of AD is well known to be only approximately 80% accurate and this and other studies thus provided the foundation for moving towards a biological basis (protein biomarker profile) for more accurate clinical diagnosis of the presence of on-going AD brain pathology. Two populations were used in our study: [1] participants in the multicenter study, the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [100 early AD, 196 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 115 cognitively normal age-matched controls, all clinically diagnosed] provided CSF samples collected at 56 centers at the participants’ BASELINE visit and [2] an independent population, followed at the University of Pennsylvania Alzheimers Disease Clinical Core, of 56 autopsy-confirmed AD participants and 52 age-matched living cognitively normal controls. Besides inclusion of an ADNI-independent population for assessment of cut-point values for each of the three AD biomarkers as well as for the ratios t-tau/Aβ1-42 and p-tau181/Aβ1-42, another key feature in this study was the close collaboration between an IVD company and a University lab with the aim to generate the best-in-class assays for the benefit the patients, the inclusion of autopsy diagnosis for the AD patients, the accepted gold standard for diagnosis of this disease. This enabled (i) determination of the accuracy of prediction of AD pathology assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) analyses, (ii) determination of cut-points for the individual proteins and their ratios and (iii) establishment of a logistic regression model that combined Aβ42, t-tau and APOε4 genotype. AUC values ranged from 0.913 for CSF Aβ42 concentration alone, and up to 0.942 for the combination of Aβ42, t-tau and APOε4 genotype. Importantly, the same lot of reagents was used for the analyses in both populations thus removing lot to lot variability from measurement errors. At the time this work was done, it was a considerable source of variability using this “for research-use-only (RUO)” immunoassay. It was an important additional feature of this study.

These cut-points were then applied to the ADNI participant data, for assessments of the presence or absence of AD pathology and for prediction of progression to a clinical diagnosis of AD dementia.

Despite the advances in the validation of CSF AD biomarker-based diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease this study provided, using the xMAP-based immunoassay with demonstrated within-lab precision performance of 5-10%CV across the 3 AD biomarkers, a major limitation of this RUO methodology was the limited ability to achieve inter-center agreement (%CV values ranging up to 30% across centers) using a common set of CSF samples, likely due to the many steps involved in this highly manual methodology. The paper helped the field to set the stage for the future development of highly automated methods developed by Roche (Elecsys platform) and Fujirebio (Lumipulse platform), each with a documented analytical precision in the 3-7%CV range. The Lumipulse assay was recently granted approval from the US FDA to market as the first in vitro diagnostic test for early detection of amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease using the ratio Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 in CSF. Our beloved colleague, John Trojanowski, recently passed away and we take this opportunity to express our continued appreciation for his inspiration of relating combined measurement of biomarker analysis in biofluids to assess neuropathology.
