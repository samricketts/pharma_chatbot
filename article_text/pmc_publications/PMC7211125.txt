SUMMARY

Lysosomal dysfunction is considered pathogenic in Alzheimer Disease (AD). Loss of Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) function causing AD impedes acidification via defective vATPase V0a1 subunit delivery to lysosomes. We report that isoproterenol and related β2-adrenergic agonists re-acidify lysosomes in PSEN1 KO cells and fibroblasts from PSEN1 familial AD(FAD) patients, which restores lysosomal proteolysis, calcium homeostasis, and normal autophagy flux. We identify a novel rescue mechanism involving PKA-mediated facilitation of ClC-7 delivery to lysosomes which reverses markedly lowered Cl− content in PSEN1 KO lysosomes. Notably, PSEN1 loss-of-function impedes ER-to-lysosome delivery of ClC-7. Transcriptomics of PSEN1-deficient cells reveal strongly down-regulated ER-to-lysosome transport pathways and reversibility by isoproterenol thus accounting for lysosomal Cl− deficits that compound pH elevation due to deficient vATPase and rescue by β2-adrenergic agonists. Our findings uncover a broadened PSEN1 role in lysosomal ion homeostasis and novel pH modulation of lysosomes through β2-adrenergic regulation of ClC-7, which can potentially be modulated therapeutically.

INTRODUCTION

Lysosomal dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of an increasing number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) [1–6]. Common features of these disease states are delayed vesicular trafficking, reduced lysosomal proteolysis, and marked accumulation of autophagy substrates and protein aggregates [7–9]. Abnormally elevated lysosomal pH has been recognized as a possible basis for global lysosomal dysfunction in certain congenital lysosomal storage disorders as well as recently in late age onset disorders, including PD and AD [6, 10]. The vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) complex, the proton pump serving as the primary driver of lysosomal acidification [11], requires assembly of at least 13 subunits comprising a membrane-associated V0 sector and a cytoplasmic V1 sector that reversibly associates with V0 to regulate vATPase activity in response to many cellular signals [12]. Chloride channel-7 (ClC-7), mediating the import of chloride ions serves as a counterion conductance channel [13–19] to prevent hyperpolarization of the lysosomal membrane by vATPase mediated proton import [20–22]. In this role, ClC-7-mediated chloride influx is required and allows for optimal vATPase function. The establishment of a highly acidic intralumenal pH [13, 23, 24]. Loss of the ClC-7 channel induces lysosomal dysfunction causing osteopetrosis, retinal degeneration and neurodegeneration in mice and humans [16, 25, 26].

In early onset AD caused by loss of function mutations of Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) [27], mutant PSEN1 within a “gamma secretase” complex impedes intramembrane proteolysis of varied substrates, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP), metabolites of which are implicated in AD pathogenesis [28]. In addition, PSEN1 holoprotein plays a key chaperone role in the ER to facilitate lysosomal delivery of the V0a1 subunit, the critical 10 transmembrane span protein subunit of the vATPase V0 sector. PSEN1-FAD mutations and PSEN1 deficiency impair the glycosylation of V0a1 and increase its vulnerability to ER associated protein degradation (ERAD) leading to its premature degradation and to reduced vATPase assembly and acidification of lysosomes [29–31]. Among the consequences of impaired lysosome acidification are robust accumulation of lysosome substrates, efflux of lysosomal Ca2+ from TRPML1 channels, and reduced cell survival, which have been documented in various cell models of PSEN1-deficiency and in fibroblasts and IPSCs from PSEN1-FAD patients, and mouse models of PSEN1-FAD where lysosomal dysfunction is known to accelerate neurodegeneration [32–35]. Elevated lysosomal pH can be reversed by targeting acidic nano-particles to lysosomes [30, 36–38]; however, nano-particle treatment in clinical settings is challenging, prompting us to investigate a pharmacological approach to achieve lysosomal re-acidification.

In the current study, select members of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) agonist family normalized elevated pH in PSEN1 KO cells and primary fibroblasts derived from patients with familial AD (FAD) caused by mutation of PSEN1 (PSEN1-FAD). These compounds, as represented by the clinically used agent isoproterenol (ISO), reversed impairments of lysosomal hydrolase activity and autophagic flux, and substantially reduced abnormal accumulation of autophagic vesicles (AV). We discovered that markedly lowered lysosomal chloride content in PSEN1-deficient cells reflected deficiency of ClC-7 activity selectively in lysosomes, stemming from stalled ER-to-lysosome delivery of ClC-7 and a downregulation of gene transcriptional programs regulating this transport process. These findings uncover a novel role for PSEN1 in ClC-7 regulation and broaden the role played by PSEN1in lysosomal ion homeostasis. Finally, we show here that a PKA-dependent signaling pathway induced by β2-AR agonist facilitates ClC-7 delivery to lysosomes and is associated with selective upregulation of ER protein export and trafficking transcriptional programs. Collectively these findings provide both the mechanism of action of β2-AR agonists in rescuing lysosomal pH in the context of persistent lowered vATPase activity and they identify a new regulatory mechanism for ClC-7 activity in lysosomes relevant to potential therapy for a growing number of diseases associated with defects in lysosomal acidification (Colacurcio 2018).

RESULTS

ISO restores lysosomal pH, proteolytic functions, and calcium efflux in PSEN1-deficient and primary PSEN1-FAD fibroblasts

We initially tested compounds within several chemical classes that potentially could improve AD pathology or activate the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, including the calcium antagonist (Nicardipine), Resveratrol [39], the a2A-AR agonist (Rilmenidine [40]) and the β2-AR agonist (Isoproterenol [41]), by assaying lysosomal pH restoration in PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 1A). The pH values were determined from the standard curve generated via pH calibration sample (Figure S1). Among the compounds tested, we identified a subset of β2-AR agonists (Figure S2), including ISO, as capable of fully restoring the lysosomal pH of PSEN1 KO cells to levels in WT cells (Figure 1A). To confirm that the pH rescue effect of ISO was generalizable beyond blastocysts (BD) (Figure 1B), we tested ISO in PSEN1 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure 1C) and primary human fibroblasts derived from FAD patients carrying the AD-related M233T PSEN1 mutation (PSEN1 FAD fibroblasts) (Figure 1D) and observed similar effects, thus establishing restoration of lysosomal pH in three different PS1-loss of function settings, including authentic early-onset AD. Lysotracker staining confirmed that ISO significantly increased Lysotracker signal intensity from 27.3% to 79.2 % in PSEN1 KO BD cells, hereafter referred to as PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 1E).

We then examined the effects of ISO on lysosomal proteolysis and lysosomal enzyme (cathepsin) activity, both of which are defective in PSEN1 KO cells [29]. ISO restored activity of both cathepsin-B (CTSB) and CTSD to near WT levels, as assayed by Magic Red-CatB and Bodipy-Fl-Pepstatin A live imaging, respectively (Figure 1F and 1G). Cathepsin activities in WT cells were not significantly altered by ISO treatment despite a reduction by ISO of lysosomal pH below untreated levels in WT cells (Figure 1F, 1G). Deficient CTSD activity was also reversed in ISO-treated PSEN1-FAD human fibroblasts as measured by in vivo Bodipy-Fl-Pepstatin A (Figure 1H).

Consistent with restored proteolysis by ISO, a four-fold elevated level of the autophagic marker LC3-II in PSEN1 KO cells was reversed (Figure 2A). To assess autophagic flux, cells were transiently transfected with tandem mRFP-eGFP-tagged LC3 (tfLC3). LC3 puncta fluorescing yellow correspond to autophagosomes (AP) or incompletely acidified/unacidified autolysosomes (AL) and red appear in AL that were acidified upon fusion with lysosomes in vitro and in vivo [42, 43]. PS1KO cells exhibit a significantly higher ratio of yellow to red vesicles, indicative of stalled autophagic clearance (Figure 2B). Upon treatment of PSEN1 KO cells with ISO, numbers of red and yellow puncta reverted to percentages approaching levels measured in untreated WT cells, establishing a substantial restoration of autophagy flux (Figure 2B) consistent with increased AP clearance due to lysosomal pH correction by ISO.

Ultrastructural morphometry of autophagic compartments further established the restoration of lysosomal function by ISO by quantitative ultrastructural analysis. We confirmed the significant accumulation of AP, AL and reduced numbers of nascent lysosomes in untreated PSEN1 KO cells compared to WT cells (Figure 2C). ISO treatment substantially reduced the abnormal autophagic vacuoles accumulation and reversed the lysosomal deficit in PSEN1 KO cells, while having no evident effects on WT cells (Figure 2C).

PSEN1 KO cells abnormally efflux lysosomal Ca2+ via TRPML1 channels into the cytosol due to defective lysosome acidification and this abnormality is reversed by nanoparticle-mediated lysosomal re-acidification [30]. Based on these findings, we investigated ISO effects on lysosomal Ca2+ levels in PSEN1 KO cells. Consistent with our earlier report, ISO restores lysosomal pH in PSEN1 KO cells to untreated WT levels within 6 hrs whereas inhibiting the abnormal NAADP-mediated release of Ca2+ from lysosomes with the inhibitor Ned-19 [30] does not reverse pH elevation in these cells (Figure 2D). Together with data in Fig. 1A on the Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine, this data suggests that the altered levels of lysosomal Ca2+ in PSEN1 KO cells do not influence lysosomal reacidification by ISO. By contrast, we found that ISO treatment raised abnormally low lysosomal Ca2+ levels in PSEN1 KO cells to levels in ISO-treated WT cells and lowered cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Figure 2E, F). These data indicate that the lysosomal Ca2+ efflux defect in PSEN1 KO cells is secondary to defective lysosomal acidification and, therefore, ISO treatment is able to reverse both deficits.

ISO-induced lysosomal acidification is mediated by the ß-adrenergic signaling pathway.

Based on earlier findings that β-AR agonists [41] and cAMP [35] can promote lysosomal acidification, we further evaluated involvement of the canonical β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) signaling pathway in lysosomal re-acidification of PSEN1 KO cells using β-AR signaling modulating agents. Treatment of PSEN1 KO cells with the β-AR antagonist, propranolol (PRO, 2 μM), for 6 hrs did not promote lysosomal re-acidification indicating that the effect of ISO on lysosomal pH is specific to the activation of β-AR (Figure 3A). It has been know that PRO has a much higher affinity of binding to β-AR than does ISO [44]. We therefore pretreated PSEN1 KO cells with PRO for 1 hr prior to adding ISO to confirm whether pH restoration seen in PSEN1 KO cell is mediated by β-AR. Under this condition, PRO prevented re-acidification of lysosomes by ISO in PSEN1 KO cells, thus reinforcing the idea that activation of the β-AR signaling cascade is critical for lysosomal pH restoration by ISO (Figure 3A).

As β-ARs are prototypical G-coupled protein receptors, binding of ISO to the β-AR should activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) and elevate cAMP levels in the canonical β-AR signaling pathway. To test this possibility, we treated PSEN1 KO cells for 6 hrs with forskolin to elevate cAMP levels by directly activating adenylyl cyclase or with Rolipram (ROL) to inhibit the cAMP-degrading protein PDE4 [45, 46]. Both compounds re-acidified lysosomes in PSEN1 KO cells, mimicking the similar effect of ISO (Figure 3B). In canonical β-AR signaling, elevated cAMP stimulates down-stream activation of PKA [47]. We established the expected PKA involvement in ISO effects by showing that pre-treatment of PSEN1 KO cells with the PKA inhibitor, H-89 [48] abolished the pH rescue effects of ISO (Figure 3C) while having no effects on lysosomal pH by itself in these cells. Collectively, these data implicate the β-AR signaling cascade in ISO-induced re-acidification of PSEN1 KO lysosomes.

The lysosomal chloride channel, CLC-7, is necessary for ISO-induced re-acidification.

It is known that cAMP stimulates the Cl− import into lysosomes provides a critical counter ion flux necessary for correct lysosomal acidification [17–19, 49]. This suggests that Cl− flux mediated by the β-AR signaling cascade possibly re-acidified lysosomes in PSEN1 KO cells. To investigate a possible role of Cl− in PS1KO lysosomal dysfunction, we measured the levels of lysosomal Cl− in purified lysosome fractions using fluorescent Cl− indicator (n-ethoxycarbonylmethy-6-methoxyquinolium bromide: MQAE). Fluorescence emission of MQAE was reduced upon increasing the concentrations of Cl−. Magnetic bead purified lysosomes were ruptured using glycyl-L-phenylalanine-beta-naphthylamide (GPN) and released lysosomal Cl− was measured via MQAE quenching. We found that lysosomal Cl− levels were markedly reduced (~55%) in PSEN1 KO cells compared to those in WT cells. Importantly, however, the Cl− level was restored to normal by ISO-treatment (Figure 3D). The MQAE values were determined from the standard curve (Figure S1). To further investigate the relevance of Cl− in the ISO mechanism of action, we incubated cells in the presence or absence of the routine concentration of Cl− in culture medium prior to treatment with ISO. Surprisingly, Cl− free media itself significantly increased lysosomal pH to nearly neutral range not only in PSEN1 KO but also WT cells. (Figure 3E). Moreover, under these conditions, ISO was unable to restore lysosomal pH to normal level in PSEN1 KO cells, establishing that normal Cl− levels are necessary for lysosomal pH maintenance and for ISO-induced lysosomal re-acidification.

The foregoing findings raised the likely possibility that ISO normalizes Cl− levels and pH by upregulating lysosomal Cl− channel function prompted us to further explore this possibility. ClC-7 is a member of the H+/Cl− exchange transporter family and is the primary Cl− permeation pathway in the lysosome [13, 16]. To investigate its possible involvement in lysosome reacidification by ISO, we blocked the actions of ClC-7 using two different approaches: pharmacological inhibition and CLCN7 silencing. So far there is no known ClC-7 specific inhibitor available, so we alternatively used the pan-ClC inhibitor, 4,4’-octanamidostilbene-2,2’-disulfonate (OADS) [50]. We observed that OADS (10 mM) treatment significantly elevated the lysosomal pH of both PSEN1 KO and WT cells (Fig. 3F) and, more importantly, a subsequent treatment with ISO failed to re-acidify lysosomes in either PSEN1 KO cells or WT cells. These findings suggested that ClC-7 is a key Cl− channel and its activation is required for maintaining lysosomal acidic pH, although we could not completely rule-out the contribution of other ClCs by using OADS treatment. To accomplish this, we knocked down ClC-7 protein using an shRNA specific to ClC-7. Under ClC-7 knockdown conditions (Figure S3), ISO had no effect on lysosomal re-acidification, whereas a non-functional scrambled shRNA construct used as a control did not prevent rescue of pH by ISO (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate that ClC-7 is essential for the effects of ISO on lysosomal re-acidification in PSEN1 KO cells.

ISO stimulates lysosomal translocation of ClC-7 in PSEN1 KO cells.

To further investigate the basis for the reduced ClC-7 activity in PSEN1 KO cells as well as the mechanism for ISO-induced ClC-7 stimulation, we assayed the protein levels of ClC-7 in WT and PSEN1 KO cells. Quantitative immunoblot analyses demonstrated no change in levels of ClC-7 protein in total lysates from PSEN1 KO cells compared to those in WT (Figure 4A) and no effects of ISO treatment on levels of ClC-7 protein in total lysates of PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 4B), which ruled out a translational response to impaired lysosomal acidification via an increase in ClC-7 protein expression.

Based on these data which showed no effects of ISO on total protein levels of ClC-7, we hypothesized that ISO-mediated lysosomal re-acidification may be mediated at the subcellular level through a change in ClC-7 subcellular localization. Previous studies demonstrated that delayed trafficking of ClC-7 to the lysosomes is a basis for the lowered extent of acidification seen in unstimulated primary microglia. These unstimulated cells exhibit incomplete lysosome acidification compared to the higher acidification levels achieved when these cells are activated by macrophage-colony stimulating factor. The basis for greater acidification involves more efficient ER to lysosome delivery and reduced ERAD degradation of ClC-7. Importantly, a key feature of this mechanism is increased expression of ClC-7 as well as OSTM1, a protein that plays a key role in lysosomal targeting of ClC-7 [24, 51]. Of further relevance, we previously demonstrated that the V0a1 subunit of vATPase was abnormally retained in the ER in PSEN1 KO cells due to loss of the ER chaperone function of full-length PSEN1, which results in incomplete glycosylation and premature ERAD degradation of V0a1 leading to impaired vATPase-dependent lysosomal acidification. While implying somewhat different mechanisms, these earlier findings suggested that PSEN1 loss of function might also impede the trafficking of ClC-7, another multi-span membrane protein like V0a1 subunit, causing it to be abnormally retained in the ER. Strongly supporting this possibility, we observed that ClC-7 levels are markedly reduced in lysosome-enriched fractions of PSEN1 KO cells compared to WT cells (Figure 4C) and that ISO treatment significantly elevated ClC-7 level in lysosomes from PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 4D). To further confirm rescue of the lysosomal targeting of ClC-7, we examined the colocalization of ClC-7 and the lysosomal marker LAMP2 by double-immunofluorescence immunocytochemistry. We again found that levels of ClC-7 in lysosomes were reduced in PSEN1 KO cells but were substantially elevated by ISO treatment (Figure 4E). Consistent with this observation, the amount of ClC-7 retained in the ER (PDI) was markedly reduced in ISO treated PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 4F). Collectively, these findings show that ISO reverses the impaired delivery of ClC-7 to the lysosome essential for ISO-mediated reacidification of lysosomes in PSEN1 KO cells.

RNA-seq transcriptomics reveal down-regulation of ER protein export in PSEN1 KO cells reversed by ISO

Because earlier studies implicate transcriptional events in lysosomal pH regulation [24, 52], we investigated transcriptional responses to PSEN1-deficiency and ISO rescue effects by performing whole genome RNA-seq analysis of WT and PSEN1 KO cells with and without ISO treatment. We found a total of 5,939 genes that were significantly up-regulated and 5,758 genes that were down-regulated, whereas 3,961 genes were unchanged at FDR &lt;0.05 in PSEN1 KO cells compared to WT cells (Figure 5A). Highly similar gene expression profile was also seen in PSEN1 FAD human fibroblast (Figure S4). By comparison. ~7% (1,047) genes were significantly up-regulated and ~7% (1,078) genes were down-regulated at FDR &lt; 0.05 in PSEN1 KO cells compared to ISO treated PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 6A). Notably, RNA-seq results also point towards selective larger effects of ISO in altering transcription in PSEN1 KO cells compared to its relatively small effects in WT. At FDR &lt; 0.05, ISO significantly altered ~8% (1,241 genes) of the unique genes in PSEN1 KO whole genome as compared to untreated PSEN1 KO cells. By contrast, ISO significantly altered only 0.9% (148 genes) of the unique genes in WT cells total genome compared to untreated WT cells (Figure 5B).

Consistent with our western blot data, expression of the ClC-7 related genes, CLCN7 and OSTM1 were not altered by ISO in PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 5C). A barplot of mRNA expression of 5 transcription factors known to be involved in lysosomal biogenesis, expressed as TMM-normalized Counts Per Million (CPM) values (See Methods), revealed in PSEN1 KO cells a significant decrease in melanocyte inducing transcription factor (MITF) mRNA levels and more modest but significant down-regulation of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) and transcription factor E3 (TFE3) transcription, while transcription factor EB (TFEB) and forkhead box O3 (FOXO1) were significantly elevated compared to WT (Figure 5D). However, the net effect of these changes on the lysosomal proteins targeted by these factors was that the expression of lysosomal hydrolase related genes did not change significantly due to ISO treatment (Figure 5E). We compared our transcriptional profile of the PSEN1 KO cells with and without ISO treatment to a previously published expression signature derived from human IVF primary granulosa cells in response to forskolin (FSK) exposure [53]. As expected, the gene set analysis revealed that global expression in PSEN1 KO was highly negatively correlated (P &lt; 0.000009), with expression changes that occur in response to FSK in human IVF primary granulosa cells, when compared to WT (Figure S5A). Consistent with this, FSK response gene set was also significantly correlated with global expression change in PSEN1 FAD human fibroblast compare to control human fibroblast (Figure S5B). Also consistent with observed ISO induced β2-AR cascade involvement in re-acidification of PSEN1 KO lysosomes, global expression changes accompanying ISO treatment of PSEN1 KO cells were specifically and highly positively correlated (P &lt; 0.0008) with expression changes in response to FSK. These data reveal that the cAMP signaling cascade was reduced in PSEN1 KO cells compared to WT cells, but that ISO reversed this defect.

To further investigate the global gene network change under ISO treatment, we performed GSEA on our manually curated gene sets (Table S1) representing relevant pathways. In support of our hypothesis that PSEN1 KO may impede proper maturation and delivery to lysosomes of complex multi-span membrane proteins involved in pH regulation (e.g. V0a1 and ClC-7), GSEA results revealed significant down-regulation of protein transport, endosome to lysosome and vesicle-mediated transport, and Golgi recycling and secretory components in PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 6A). We found similar down-regulation of these gene categories in PSEN1 FAD human fibroblasts (Figure S3B). Our data further revealed that down regulation of these protein transport gene categories in PSEN1 KO cells was reversed by ISO treatment (Figure 6A). We found that ISO does not have a significant effect on any of these pathways in WT cells. Moreover, the hierarchical clustering analysis unequivocally shows ISO induced upregulation of genes involved in protein transport in PSEN1 KO cells (Figure 6B). Additionally, the comprehensive list of genes involved in intracellular transport (Table S1) was significantly down-regulated in PSEN1 KO cells compared to WT cells (P=3.9×10−5, FDR=1.1×10−4) and reversed by ISO treatment (P=2.2×10−4, FDR=1.7×10−3) (Figure 6C). Pathway enrichment analyses of genes significantly upregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05) in response to ISO treatment in PSEN1 KO cells compared to untreated condition with Gene Ontology (Biological Process) and Reactome pathways revealed enrichment of not only ER/Golgi protein trafficking categories, as identified above, but also prominent enrichment of pathways regulating the unfolded protein response (Figure 6D), which likely contributes to a facilitation of the folding of complex proteins in the absence of PSEN1. Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering dendrogram of ER to Golgi anterograde transport pathway genes (GO:0006888) showing expression values of candidate genes as Z-score also shows upregulation of the pathway in PSEN1 KO cells upon ISO treatment (Figure 6E). Genes downregulated in PSEN1 KO but upregulated by ISO, included multiple Sec, Trappc, Sar1 family genes, which are known to promote transport vesicle formation from ER and vesicular transport from ER to Golgi.

Collectively, the foregoing analyses suggest that ISO promotes transport of ClC-7 from ER to lysosomes in PSEN1 KO cells where ClC-7 is abnormally retained in ER as confirmed by protein assays (Figure 4 C, D) and immunocytochemistry (Figure 4E, F).

DISCUSSION

Beginning with findings that FAD-PSEN1 mutations or deletion disrupt lysosomal vATPase assembly causing broad lysosomal dysfunction in AD [29], deficits of vATPase-mediated acidification have been implicated in the pathogenesis of additional neurodegenerative conditions ranging from congenital lysosomal storage disorders to late-age onset diseases such as PD, and Frontotemporal Dementia [2, 54]. Although broad ameliorative effects on brain function have been seen upon restoring normal lysosomal acidification, these interventions have mainly involved genetic manipulations (e.g. TFEB overexpression, cystatin B or C KO) and other modulations (acidic nanoparticles) [36, 38, 55, 56], which are challenging to translate into clinical therapies. In this report, we identify a subfamily of β2-AR agonists that re-acidify lysosomes in PSEN1-FAD fibroblasts and PSEN1 deficient models and rapidly restore lysosomal functions including proteolysis, autophagy flux, calcium signaling, and chloride homeostasis. A novel mechanism underlies β2-AR-related rescue of lysosome acidification which involves correction of a deficit in ER to lysosome delivery of ClC-7 and its transcriptional regulation previously unrecognized in the phenotype of PSEN1 deficient cells. Collectively, our results uncover a novel pathway from β2-AR stimulation through cAMP and PKA that restores normal lysosomal ClC-7 levels and ameliorates deficient lysosomal acidification and associated global lysosomal dysfunction in PSEN1KO cells.

Reduced lysosomal levels of the Cl−/H+ exchange channel ClC-7 in PSEN1 deficient cells markedly lowered Cl− content in lysosomes, the cell’s largest organellar Cl− store. Although the main role of Cl− channels in neurons is regulating neuronal excitability, Cl− channels in intracellular compartments, such as Golgi, endosomes and lysosomes, can be important for maintaining the pH of these compartments [57, 58]. Even though vATPase-mediated proton import is the principal driver of lysosomal acidification, ClC-7-mediated electrogenic H+/Cl− exchange influences lysosomal pH under certain conditions [13, 24]. Moreover, CLCN7 mutations can cause osteopetrosis and neurodegeneration by impairing lysosomal acidification [26, 59]. Nevertheless, the role of ClC-7 as a counter-ion in basal lysosomal acidification has remained controversial [18, 24, 57]. Under normal conditions, the vATPase primarily promotes acidification by proton influx, but it is conceivable that, under certain lysosome mobilizing conditions (e.g. microglial activation) [24] or pathological states of vATPase deficiency [30], ClC-7 plays a critical role in “fine tuning” lysosomal acidification. In the case of microglial activation, the macrophage colony stimulating factor increases content of ClC-7 by greatly elevating transcription of mRNA for not only ClC-7 but also for OSTM1, which encodes a protein facilitating ER exit of ClC-7 and delivery to lysosomes [24]. This mechanism differs from the ISO mediated mechanism in our study, which achieved re-acidification without upregulating transcription of ClC-7 and OSTM1 or increasing total cell ClC-7 protein levels.

The importance of ClC-7 mobilization in rescuing PSEN1 deficiency is underscored by the observation that β2-AR-mediated acidification rescue minimally altered deficient vATPase V0a1 subunit delivery to lysosomes or proton pump activity. ClC-7 facilitates acidification by importing Cl− as a counterion to reduce the electrogenic gradient that develops as vATPase pumps protons into the lysosome. Consistent with this being an ancillary role, rescue of acidification by ClC-7 in PSEN1-deficiency still required vATPase activity, albeit at the much lower residual activity level in PSEN1 KO lysosomes. In this context, it is noteworthy that we performed measurements of vATPase proton import with an abundance of ATP and in vivo functions of the vATPase are highly regulated [60]; so it is reasonable to speculate that a sub-maximal rate of proton import by the vATPase still contributes to acidification, while being unable to acidify lysosomes to their normal levels.

The observation that β2-AR stimulation improves ER export of ClC-7 but not vATPase V0a1 subunit suggests that the multiple factors governing efficiency of ER protein export contribute differentially to the causes and rescue of ClC-7 and V0a1 deficits. Although both proteins are large multi-membrane spanning proteins that may have folding challenges, only V0a1 is glycosylated co-translationally and PSEN1-related failure of this process is a major contributor to misfolding and premature ERAD degradation of the V0a1 subunit [30]. This glycosylation deficit is not expected to be rescued by PKA-mediated reversal of a downregulated ER export transcriptional program. Although ISO effects on lysosomal reacidification are not from direct action on PSEN1, in accord with evidence for mutant PSEN1 disrupting ER export of cadherin to the plasma membrane [61], we find PSEN1 is involved in protein transport from the ER to the lysosome and that ISO mediated activation of the β2-AR pathway via PKA enhanced trafficking of ClC-7 from the ER to the lysosome allowing for improved lysosomal function.

Stimulation of the β2-AR pathway and ClC-7 functional enhancement represents new, pharmacologically relevant targets to be further investigated in future studies aimed at reversing lysosomal impairment in a growing number of diseases known to have acidification deficits. Lysosomal dysfunction is an early and critical factor in the pathogenesis of AD, and the promise of lysosomal remediation as an AD therapy is supported by studies in animal models of AD [5, 62, 63]. Stimulation of the β-AR pathway is known to promote dendritic growth in the hippocampus and reduce memory deficits in APP/PS1 mouse AD models [64], although the mechanisms are unclear. Inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) using rolipram (or similar compounds) improves cognitive function and reduces pathological markers in rodent AD models [65–68]. Enriched environments that enhance β2-AR signaling lowered prevented amyloid-β induced microglia inflammation [69]. In Parkinson’s Disease(PD) patients, use of salbutamol, a β2-AR agonist conferred reduced disease risk, while use of propranolol, a β-AR antagonist, was associated with increased PD risk [70]. Taken together, our findings define a novel pathway for enhancing lysosomal acidification by mobilizing ClC-7 delivery to lysosomes. Remediation of lysosomal function, especially by correcting acidification deficits, represents a promising avenue towards therapy in AD and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and Pre-processing

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, #74004). Whole genome mRNA sequencing was performed at NYUMC Genomics Technology Center (New York, USA) from RNA obtained described in qPCR methodology above. Quality of RNA was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (NANO). Three biological replicates were produced per each group i.e. PSEN1 KO, WT, PSEN1 KO+ISO and WT+ISO. 500 ng of total RNA were used to prepare cDNA library using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with PolyA selection. The quality of libraries was assessed with Agilent 2200 TapeStation system. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine with 50 bp paired-end reads. RTA (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for base calling and bcl2fastq (v1.8.4) for converting BCL to FASTQ format. fastq_screen (v0.5.2) was used to quality check fastq reads for contamination by mapping against multiple genomes. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.36) package. STAR aligner (v2.6.0a) was used to align/map processed reads with reference mouse genome mm10 from UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz Genomics Institute) and the mapped reads were quantified using featureCounts from Subread package (v1.6.3).

RNA-seq data analyses

The entire downstream analysis was performed in R. For differential gene expression analysis, EdgeR and Limma packages (limma-voom pipeline) from R/Bioconductor were used. CPM (Counts Per Million) values were used in log2-transformed scale after TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) normalization using EdgeR. Both raw and processed data are available through Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository, accession number: GSE136894. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of gene sets within the expression data was carried out using mroast functionality from ROAST, which assesses the overall magnitude and direction of change of a gene set within a comparison in the whole expression profile. Gene sets were considered significantly enriched if the adjusted (Benjamini–Hochberg method) P-value i.e. FDR (q-value) was &lt;0.05 in pairwise comparisons using 100,000 random rotations. For Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis, we used Enrichr (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) using its GO_Biological_Process_2018 and Reactome_2018 libraries respectively.

Lysosomal pH measurement

Quantification of lysosomal pH was determined using dextran-conjugated Lysosensor Yellow/Blue (Fisher Scientific). About 3,000 cells were seeded in multiple wells of black, clear bottom tissue culture treated 96 well plates and grown to ~90% confluency (~24 hours). A 96 well plate was divided into 4 sectors (1) triplicated each pH standard wells for WT cell (2) triplicated each pH standard wells for PSEN1 KO cell, (3) WT cells w/ or w/o treatment, (4) PSEN1 KO cells w/ or w/o treatment. After that 2 ul of 0.05 mg/ml Lysosensor Yellow/Blue-dextran was added and incubated for 12 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. The standard curve generation was performed according to the protocol established by Diwu et al. [71]. Briefly, cells were treated with 10 uM monensin and 10 uM nigericin in MES buffer (5 mM NaCl, 115 mM KCL, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 25 mM MES), with the pH adjusted to a range from 3.5–7.0 for 10 min after Lysosensor Yellow/Blue-dextran incubation. Cells were washed 3 times with HBSS and then read in a Wallac Victor 2 fluorimeter (Perkin Elmer) with excitation at 355 nm. The ratio of emission 440 nm/535 nm was then calculated for each sample. All readings were triplicated, and the average values were used for calculations. The pH values were determined from the standard curve generated via the pH calibration samples.

Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting

Cells used for western blot analysis were lysed in buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH=7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Tween-20 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors added. Samples were mixed with 2x urea sample buffer and incubated 15 min at 55°C for ClC-7 electrophoresis, otherwise mixed with 2x SDS sample buffer and incubated 5 min at 100°C. Following electrophoresis on 4–20% Tris-Glycine gels, or 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Fisher Scientific), proteins were transferred onto 0.45μm nitrocellulose (Pall Corp.) membranes and the membranes were incubated overnight in primary antibody (4° C) and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour. Blots were developed using an ECL kit (Fisher Scientific).

Live lysosomal acidity and enzyme activity assay

Live imaging was performed as previously described [72]. Organelles with low internal pH were labeled by LysoTracker DND-99 dye (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 100 nM for 60 min. For assessing in vivo CTSB activation, MagicRed–Cathepsin B (Immunochemistry Technologies) for active CTSB was added to the cells at the concentration suggested by the company (1:260). Cells were incubated for 30 min with MR-Cathepsin B. Active CTSD was labeled by adding Bodipy-FL-Pepstatin A (Fisher Scientific) directly to the medium at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1 hr. Following a wash with PBS, fresh medium was added for live imaging. Signal intensity of the cell was analyzed using the Image J program (NIH). Signal intensity (Int.) % was calculated by relative intensity compare to WT (100%).

Immunocytochemistry with confocal laser scanning microscopy

Immunocytochemistry was performed as previously described [72]. Following 4% PFA fixation and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 10 min, cells were stained with anti-ClC7 rabbit polyclonal antibody together with anti-Lamp2 rat monoclonal antibody or anti-PDI mouse monoclonal antibody for overnight and visualized with Alexa Fluor 444 and 568 conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were imaged using a plan-Apochromat 40x or 100x/1.4 oil DIC objective lens on the laser scanning confocal microscope, LSM510 META, with LSM software 3.5 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc). Images were analyzed using the Image J program (NIH).

Ultrastructural analyses

Procedures were performed as previously described [29]. Following treatments, cells were prepared for EM as previously described and sections were examined and photographed with a Philips CM10 electron microscope. EM images were blindly coded during image capturing and genotype and treatment conditions were decoded after image analysis. AVs were identified using previously described morphological criteria [29]: Lysosomes - clear, single membrane vesicles; Autolysosomes (AL) - single membrane vesicle with significant undigested cargo; Autophagosomes - double membrane organelles with identifiable organellar or cytoplasmic contents or, when more mature, unidentifiable amorphous dense or membranous material present in the lumen.

Lysosomal Isolation

Cells were incubated in growth medium containing 1mM HEPES, pH 7.2 and 10% Dextran conjugated magnetite (Liquid Research LLC) for 24 hrs, then chased in normal growth media for 24 hrs. Cells were washed in PBS then harvested in 4ml of ice-cold Buffer A. Cells were then homogenized with 40 strokes of a tight-fitting pestle in a Dounce homogenizer then passed through a 22G needle 5 times. After homogenization, 500ul of ice-cold Buffer B (220mM HEPES, 375mM KCL, 22.5mM MgAc, 1mM DTT, DNase I) was added and samples were then centrifuged at 750 x g for 10 mins. The supernatant was then decanted over a QuadroMAC LS column that had previously been equilibrated with 0.5% BSA in PBS. The pellet was subjected to re-addition of 4ml cold Buffer A, 500ml cold Buffer B and then resuspended and recentrifuged. DNase I (10 μl/ml in PBS) was added and the column was then incubated for 10 min and then washed with 1ml cold PBS. Lysosomes were eluted by removing the column from the magnetic assembly, adding 500 ml of PBS and forced through the column using a plunger [73].

Lysosomal chloride measurement

Lysosomes were isolated using a magnetic chromatography method. After elution into a chloride-free buffer, the purified lysosomes (see lysosomal isolation method) were ruptured using glycyl-L-phenylalanine-beta-naphthylamide (GPN), and the release of lysosomal chloride was then measured colorimetrically using MQAE according to the manufacture’s instruction (ThermoFisher, M3101). Chloride levels were normalized to protein levels of lysosomal fractions.

Ca2+ Measurements

Cells were plated on glass bottom dishes the night before treatment. For lysosomal calcium measurements, cells were incubated with 25 ug/mL Rhod-dextran for a minimum of 12 hours before imaging. The intensity of the Rhod-dextran was quantified using ImageJ (NIH) and the change in intensity was compared to that of untreated WT cells. Release of lysosomal Ca2+ was measured using methods adapted from those previously described (Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008). For all cytosolic measurements, cells were incubated with either 2 μM Fura-2 AM in DMEM with 1% BSA and 0.0025% Pluronic acid F127 for 1 hour at 37°C then washed in complete medium and left for 10 minutes to allow de-esterification of the calcium dye. Cells were washed with HBSS (Fisher Scientific) and imaged and analyzed using ImageJ (NIH). Cells were imaged using a plan-Apochromat 40x or 100x/1.4 oil DIC objective lens on the laser scanning confocal microscope, LSM510 META, with LSM software 3.5 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc).

Analytical Procedures

The quantitative colocalization analysis was performed using ImageJ software (NIH Image) with colocalization analysis plugins (Wright Cell Imaging facility). Non-specific signal correction was performed using ImageJ with the subtract background plugin. Statistical parameters, including the definitions and value of sample size (n), deviations and p values are reported in the figures and corresponding figure legends. All experiments were performed in triplicate unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analyses using Prism 8 (Graphpad Software) were conducted on data originating from at least three independent experimental replicates. Statistical analyses between two groups were performed by one-way ANOVA test. Data are expressed as mean ±SEM.

Levels of ClC-7 in whole cell lysates were not changed in PS1KO cells (WT (1±0.04), PSEN1KO (1.13±0.09); p=0.3313). (B) ISO effects on ClC-7 protein level in PSEN1KO cells. (C) Levels of ClC-7 in a lysosomal fraction were decreased in PSEN1KO cells (WT (1±0.14), PSEN1KO (0.52±0.07). (D) Levels of ClC-7 in lysosomal fraction were restored in ISO treated PSEN1KO cells (PSEN1KO (1±0.07), PSEN1KO with ISO (1.54±0.06)). n=3. Representative images and quantification of the colocalization coefficient of (E) lysosomal marker (LAMP2) or (F) ER marker (PDI) and ClC-7 in ISO treated WT and PSEN1KO cells. n=30. In all experiments, cells were treated with 200 μM ISO for 6 hrs. Significance was determined via one-way ANOVA with Newman–Keuls post-hoc test; *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, ns: not statistically significant.

Figure 5: RNA-seq analysis of WT and PSEN 1 KO blastocysts and response to ISO

(A) Number and percentage of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in WT and PSEN1KO cells at FDR &lt; 0.05. (B) Number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in WT and PSEN1KO cells without or with ISO at FDR &lt; 0.05. (C) ISO effect on CLCN7 and OSTM1 mRNA expression level in PSEN1KO cells. (D) Barplot of mRNA expression (mean CPM values of 3 replicates of each) of 5 transcription factors shown for WT, untreated and ISO treated PSEN1KO cells. (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.001, ***P&lt;0.0005). (E) Barplot of log2 fold change of mRNA expression of lysosome related genes shown for two comparisons. (*P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.001, ***P&lt;0.0005).

Figure 6: GSEA and GO analysis reveals down-regulation of ER protein export in PSEN1KO cells and reversal by ISO

(A) GSEA results from manually curated gene sets (Table S1) for PSEN1KO with and upon ISO treatment. (B) Heatmap shows moderated t-statistic - calculated by limma with Empirical Bayes Method - of transport related genes for PSEN1KO compared to WT and PSEN1KO treated with ISO compared to PSEN1KO. ISO treatment shifts overall direction of change to “up”. (C) All transport genes (Table S1) were significantly enriched among the genes downregulated in PSEN1KO compared to WT (gene set P=0.0001) while they are upregulated in PSEN1KO upon ISO treatment when compared to PSEN1KO (gene set test P=0.002). Refer to GSE136894 for individual gene expression changes. (D) The left panel shows the top categories of GO (Gene Ontology) Biological processes found to be enriched in PSEN1KO treated with ISO in comparison to untreated PSEN1KO. The right panel shows the top pathways (REACTOME) enriched in PSEN1KO treated with ISO compared to untreated PSEN1KO. The p-values are from hypergeometric test and adjusted with Benjamini-Hochberg method of correction (P &lt; 0.01, FDR &lt; 0.01). (E) Heat map of RNA-seq gene expression of_ER to Golgi anterograde transport genes (GO: 0006888) from triplicate untreated and ISO treated PSEN1KO cells (Expression values are expressed as Z-score, with red and blue indicating up-regulation and down-regulation, respectively).
