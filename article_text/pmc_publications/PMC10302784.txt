Introduction:

Adults with Down syndrome, the largest population genetically predisposed to high risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are ideally suited participants for clinical trials targeting prevention. Critically important considerations for the design of such trials include appropriate selection of participants, outcome measures, and duration of follow-up.

Methods:

Archived data for 12 measures of performance over a 3-year period were analyzed for 185 adults with Down syndrome 36 years of age and older with presumptive preclinical AD.

Results:

Declines over 3 years were not observed prior to 46 years of age. However, declines were observed at older ages, increasing monotonically for groups aged 46–49, 50–55, and &gt;55, as did incidence of prodromal AD and dementia.

Discussion:

Significant decline over a 2- to 3-year period for a prospective placebo group of adults with Down syndrome enrolled in clinical prevention trials can only be expected when inclusion is limited to adults older than 45 years of age.

pmc1 | BACKGROUND

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently recognized to be among the most pressing public health concerns worldwide.1 With a rapidly growing elderly population, AD-related burdens will only increase in the future and major efforts focused on discovery of effective treatments and strategies for prevention are among the highest priorities of current biomedical research.2 Randomized placebo controlled clinical trials are the gold standard for evaluating efficacy of promising candidate methods, and determination of appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria is a key consideration in the design of these trials. Most importantly, the evaluation of drugs intended to reduce symptom severity or slow the progression of underlying disease need to enroll individuals who are experiencing symptoms of AD while prevention trials need to enroll individuals at risk, but prior to the onset of these symptoms. Given the slowly progressive nature of AD and the wide range of age at which progression from its preclinical to prodromal stage can occur, prevention trials face a “Catch-22″ of sorts; it can take many years for clinical progression to begin for adults exhibiting stable profiles of cognitive aging at the time of study enrollment, yet protocols need to be completed within a reasonable time frame. A key task, then, is to identify target participants who, at the time of enrollment, are symptom free but who are most likely to develop AD-related decline over the course of the next several years.

An extremely high risk for AD is now recognized as a phenotypic feature of Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21), with cumulative incidence approaching 50% by the late 50s and 80% by the late 60s.3,4 This represents the largest population of individuals at increased risk for AD linked to a specific genotype, a public health concern in its own right and a population ideally suited for prevention trials—if and only if valid methods for establishing preclinical status and detecting early stages of clinical progression are available.

Hithersay et al.5 recently recommended a possible strategy of selecting adults with DS for prevention trials and for tracking changes in performance as AD progresses. They employed mathematical modeling combining longitudinal and cross-sectional aging effects to estimate declines to be expected in their battery of cognitive tests over a 2-year period in adults with DS 36 years of age and older (mean = 48.7; S.D. = 7.2), excluding adults “with a dementia diagnosis or performing at floor-level on a given outcome measure (at baseline) … to focus on decline in the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD.” They concluded that a subset of their measures, taking under 30 minutes to administer, would be able to detect treatment effects over a 2-year period in a randomized prevention trial enrolling adults with DS 35–41 years of age (as specified in their Discussion) or 36–45 years of age (as in the Abstract). They further estimated that, assuming 75% or 35% efficacy, sample sizes of 50 per arm or 200 per arm, respectively, would have sufficient power to detect differences between placebo and treatment groups.

These predictions are of enormous potential importance and could represent a major advancement for the field. However, Hithersay et al. did not provide a direct test of their predictions and identified this as a limitation of their study. An independent validation is needed prior to adoption of these recommendations by the broader field, especially given that the Hithersay et al. modelling was based on data from only 32–65 individuals (dependent upon task-specific baseline performance). This validation was the focus of the present set of analyses.

2 | METHOD

2.1 | Participants

A subset of archived longitudinal data was examined, collected in conjunction with a long running research program focused on aging and dementia in adults with DS.6,7 All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of all participating sites and formal consents and assents were obtained for all participants. Cases were selected from a total sample of 612 adults with DS followed at approximately 18-month intervals for between a single baseline assessment and a maximum of 8 additional follow-ups. The number of follow-ups was dependent upon time of enrollment, participant availability, and program duration.

Inclusion criteria for the present analyses (with N remaining) were: (1) enrollment prior to 2005 (after which inclusion was limited to adults 50 years of age and older; N = 467), (2) Stanford-Binet IQ (or equivalent) of 30 or greater (determined from available clinical records (N = 284), (3) age 36 or older at baseline (N = 277); (4) determination of presumptive preclinical AD at baseline based on consideration of extensive contemporaneous testing and reviews of clinical history (see below; N = 207); (5) follow-up assessments at 18 and 36 months without “complications unrelated to AD” (eg, traumatic life event or serious illness—N = 185); and (6) performance on a particular test of interest at least 2 standard errors of measurement (SEMs) above the instrument’s floor at baseline to ensure that longitudinal declines could be quantified (N varied slightly depending on performance). Importantly, the 185 cases included in this subsample were selected blind to longitudinal change over time in any specific measure or in overall AD-related clinical status.

Case characteristics are provided in Table 1, divided into several age groups. The first group consisted of cases under 46 years of age at baseline to be most closely aligned with the Hithersay et al. recommendations. Older groups were between 46 and 49.9, 50 and 55.9, and 56+ years of age. Women were over-represented in this sample due to a specific programmatic interest focused on the impacts of aging on women’s health; the sex distribution for the overall population of older adults with DS is far more even.

2.2 | Neuropsychological assessment battery

The structure of the assessment battery has been described in detail in multiple previous publications of our Aging Research Program (eg,6,7). It included both informant interviews and direct one-on-one tests of performance focused on the broad range of measures likely to be affected by AD-related clinical progression and previously shown to be sensitive to the transition from cognitive stability to prodromal AD.7 Direct testing required up to two hours for completion and generated multiple outcome measures, but the present analyses only examined the following overall summary scores at three points in time (baseline, ≈18-month and ≈36-month follow-up): (1) American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities—Adaptive Behavior Scale (ABS8; Total Part I Score), (2) Dementia Questionnaire for Persons with Learning Disabilities (DLD9,10), Sum of Cognitive Scores (SCS); (3) DLD, Sum of Social Scores (SOS); (4) modified Down Syndrome Mental Status Exam (DSMSE11), sum of Memory items; (5) DSMSE, sum of Non-Memory items; (6) Block Design total score (combining items from the old Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised12 with simpler items from the original DSMSE), (7) modified Selected Reminding test,13 total Items recalled over six trials; (8) Verbal Fluency, total items named14; (9) Test for Severe Impairment (TSI15), total score, (10) Visual Motor Integration (VMI16), total raw score; (11) Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (MMMSE17), total score.18

In addition to these specific measures of performance, each participant received an overall rating AD-related clinical status following each assessment cycle. These ratings were based on profiles of performance that considered the severity of lifelong impairments. In addition, current health and neuropsychiatric conditions/concerns and comprehensive reviews of clinical histories were discussed during a consensus case conference for each individual. AD-related clinical status was rated as: (1) Cognitively Stable (CS), indicating the absence of AD-related clinical progression with reasonable certainty (an inclusion criterion at baseline for the present analyses), (2) Mild Cognitive Impairment—DS (MCI-DS), indicating the presence of declines in status likely to reflect prodromal AD, (3) Possible or definite Dementia (Dementia), indicating the presence of substantial declines of a severity characteristic of frank dementia (with a Possible rating reflecting slightly less confidence in the distinction between Dementia and MCI-DS). Other classification categories (resulting in exclusion from the present analyses—see above) reflected a high degree of uncertainty due to the presence of confounding factors unrelated to AD (eg, pre-existing levels of profound impairment making it impossible to quantify decline until late-stage AD; recent medical concern or other traumatic life event that may have had a substantial impact on performance during assessments).

2.3 | Statistical analyses

The Statistica software package, Version 13.2, was used to examine change over time for each summary score separately for each of the age-defined subgroups listed in Table 1, employing multivariate analysis of variance with Time (Baseline, 18- and 36-month follow-up) as a repeated measure. In addition, effect size for each measure of performance was calculated (η2). Cohen19 provided guidance for interpreting values of η2, with 0.01 corresponding to a small effect size, 0.06 to a medium effect size, and 0.14 to a large effect size. No correction was made for multiple comparisons to reduce type-2 errors, given the focus on validation of the Hithersay et al. findings. In addition, Age Group × Time multivariate interactions were examined with Group as a between-subjects variable and Time as a repeated measure to verify that profiles of aging differed significantly among the age-defined subgroups. Finally, to examine cross-sectional impacts of aging unrelated to declines within individuals, Age Groups were compared at baseline with IQ as a covariate.

3 | RESULTS

Analyses initially focused on the subgroup under 46 years of age at baseline to be consistent with Hithersay et al. As indicated in Table 2, no significant declines were observed. More importantly, performance was descriptively equal to or better than baseline at the 36-month follow-up for 10 of the 12 summary measures (note that decreases for the DLD/SOS and DLD/SCS indicate improvement). Further, for the two measures showing an insignificant but descriptive decline, the mean change was less than a single point and the effect size was either trivial (VMI) or small (Verbal Fluency).19 Overall classification of dementia status recorded contemporaneously indicated judgment as remaining CS in all but two cases (96.6%), one developing MCI-DS and a second progressing to Dementia with both individuals over 48 years of age when evaluated. No neuroimaging data were available, so it was not possible to determine if any of these cases had brain amyloid deposition, although more recent studies suggest that was likely at these ages.20,21

For the 46 to 50-year-old age group, five summary scores declined by more than one point but only two measures, the ABS total score and the DSMSE Memory subscore, were significantly worse (Table 3). Importantly, 13 of these 56 cases transitioned in their overall dementia status by their 36-month follow-up, with 10 (17.9%) developing MCI-DS and another three (5.4%) developing Dementia.

For the group between 50 and 55 years of age, all summary scores indicated declines descriptively, with seven of the 12 reaching significance (0.05 one-tailed; Table 4). The only measures failing to reach significance were (1) DLD/SOS, (2) DSMSE Non-Memory, (3) Verbal Fluency, (4) TSI, and (5) VMI. A substantial minority of cases now transitioned in their overall clinical status, with eight incident cases of MCI-DS (18.2%) and five additional cases of incident Dementia (11.4%).

Effects were still larger for the group over 55 years of age, with eight measures showing significant declines (Table 5). The exceptions were (1) DLD/SOS, (2) DSMSE Non-Memory, (3) TSI, and (4) MMMSE. More importantly, these changes were now of increased magnitude, with seven measures showing mean declines of over 20%. Transitions in overall clinical status also increased, with eight incident cases of MCI-DS (30.8%) plus five cases of incident Dementia (19.2%).

Multivariate Age Group × Time interactions were also examined to confirm that aging profiles differed across groups. Of the 12 summary scores, seven significant interactions (0.05 one-tailed) were found, indicating greater declines in performance at older ages for the following measures: (1) ABS, F(6,332) = 3.96, P &lt; .001; (2) DLD/SOS, F(6,328) = 3.02, P &lt; .01; (3) DLD/SCS, F(6,328) = 4.04, P &lt; .001; (4) Block Design, F(6,282) = 2.02, P &lt; .05 (one-tailed); (5) DSMSE Memory, F(6,308) = 2.33, P &lt; .04, (6) DSMSE Non-Memory, F(6,320) = 1.97, P &lt; .05 (one-tailed); (7) DSMSE Total, F(6,320) = 2.93, P &lt; .01; (8) Selected Reminding, F(6,284) = 3.64, P &lt; .002; and (9) VMI, F(6,310) = 2.99, P &lt; .008.

Finally, a set of analyses compared performance across the four age-defined groups at baseline with IQ as a covariate. All measures showed a profile consistent with aging-related decline despite inclusion of only preclinical cases, with all nine of the direct-testing measures reaching two-tailed significance, 4.94 &lt; Fs &lt; 12.60, Ps &lt; .003, and the ABS Total Score reaching one-tailed significance, F(3,174) = 2.64, P &lt; .06, while only the two DLD summary scores failed to reach significance.

Results clearly indicated that some measures were more sensitive than others to change over time. At one extreme, the TSI failed to show an effect approaching significance in any age-defined group. At the other, the DSMSE Memory items showed significant decline with aging in all but the youngest group. Other summary performance measures showed profiles ranging between these results, as indicated in Tables 2–5. Note that Verbal Fluency, proposed by Hithersay et al. as one of their most informative measures, did not show significant aging-related decline until participants were over 55 years of age.

4 | DISCUSSION

The present analyses were structured to determine the ages at which AD-related declines in specific measures of performance could be expected, with a specific interest in a cohort in the late 30s and early 40s, the age group identified by Hithersay et al. as having the most promise for enrollment in future prevention trials. Our findings provided strong empirical support for including adults with DS in future clinical trials and showed that specific measures of performance change over an interval of approximately three years for a prospective placebo group determined to be cognitively stable at the time of study enrollment. However, the present results disagreed with Hithersay et al. regarding expectations of change prior to age 46 and demonstrated clear stability in performance over a three-year period for adults with DS who were younger, between the ages of 36 and 45, and judged to be in the preclinical stage of AD progression at the time of their initial assessment. Even in the two instances where declines were present descriptively, the magnitude, less than half of a single point, is suggestive of changes associated with aging per se, rather than significant progression of an underlying neuropathology.22 Declines were observed at older ages at baseline, increasing with age in breadth and effect size for the multiple assessments examined. Thus, the present findings converged with the general Hithersay et al. recommendation of identifying adults with DS as high priority candidates for future clinical trials targeting prevention of AD. However, our analyses provided absolutely no support for the specific recommendations of Hithersay et al., which indicated expected declines over a follow-up period of 2 years for untreated adults with DS younger than 46 years of age. Declines were observed for the group in the late 40s, but effect sizes for these “prospective placebo group” declines, when present, were relatively modest in magnitude. This limits expected effect sizes for any future clinical trial where the interest would be on Group (Treatment versus Placebo) by Time interactions and where treatment will fall short of 100% efficacy. Only the groups older than 50 years of age showed consistent declines at follow-up and were all of moderate to large effect sizes.

There were obvious differences between the present procedures and those of Hithersay et al. that might explain the substantive differences in conclusions/recommendations. The Hithersay et al. sample excluded cases with frank dementia but may have included some individuals with prodromal AD. For the present analyses, only presumptively preclinical cases were included. Specific measures of performance also differed, although the domains of functional and cognitive abilities were comparable, and both sets of data indicated that performance was well above floor and well below ceiling on all selected measures. While it is possible that the specific measures selected by Hithersay et al. were more sensitive to change over time, the measures employed herein have empirically validated sensitivity to the initial transition from preclinical to prodromal AD7 and provided clear evidence of declines in older subgroups, arguing against their relative insensitivity.

Other differences included the timing and locations of data collection, the research staff performing testing, etc, but these other factors would be expected to have minimal impacts for two teams of highly experienced investigators. Finally, the design of the two studies were fundamentally different. Hithersay et al. employed sophisticated mathematical modeling to develop a set of recommendations but did not verify those predictions independently while the present analyses were structured to provide a direct empirical testing of those predictions. For better or for worse, the present findings failed to support those predictions. Nevertheless, the general mathematical approach employed by Hithersay et al. has considerable conceptual appeal, and the reason(s) for the divergence between its initial set of predictions and our findings are certainly worth exploring.

The present findings have clear implications for the design of future clinical trials quite distinct from the Hithersay et al.5 recommendations. Rather, our findings indicated that samples of adults under 46 years of age enrolled in a prevention trial would not be expected to show reliable declines over periods of two to three years. Of course, individuals younger than 50 with a pre-existing history of decline likely to be caused by AD progression could be highly informative for treatment trials targeting further AD progression, but that, by definition, is a different circumstance compared to the goal of prevention. An exception may be made when some additional risk factor is present (eg, APOE 4 genotype), but that is a topic for other research.

Even for adults with DS in their late 40s and early 50s, the two years of follow-up proposed by Hithersay et al. might be insufficient to see treatment effects in a clinical trial enrolling people with preclinical AD at baseline. The present findings suggest that three years would provide significantly greater opportunities to see significant differences between treatment and placebo groups while 18 months would clearly be insufficient. Here again, though, informative biomarkers may prove to be more sensitive to underlying progression of AD, and this is certainly a focus of currently ongoing research (eg,23).

How then are we to design clinical trials focused on prevention of AD in adults with DS? First, identification of individuals at clear risk but prior to onset of clinical decline is essential. Ages of 50 years and up seem most appropriate, but younger cases showing amyloid deposition but without a history of declining cognition beyond what would be expected with adult aging, per se, might also prove informative (eg,20,21).

An effective screening method is then needed to establish preclinical status. Recent findings from our current studies24 indicated that the section of the National Task Group-Early Detection Screen for Dementia (NTG-EDSD25) adapted from the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities26 can be extremely useful in this regard, especially given its user-friendly format and wide availability online in multiple languages. A single indication of dementia-related concern on either its “Memory” or “Language and Communication” domains provides sensitivity and specificity of approximately 0.8 (preclinical vs prodromal AD) for adults with DS at risk and even higher sensitivity when dementia is present. A more conservative criterion of at least one concern in any of its seven specific domains would identify 88.9% of cases with MCI-DS and 100% of cases with dementia. However, this more liberal criterion would also have a false positive rate of 48% and may be overly restrictive. Thus, while the NTG-EDSD falls short of a perfect screening instrument, it can serve as a viable tool by itself; its use with a second converging source of information would undoubtedly improve the process.

The period of follow-up is another obvious consideration of critical importance. For the group under 46 years of age, we saw just two cases, both over 45 at baseline and only one developing dementia, transition in their overall clinical status over a 3-year period of follow-up, consistent with findings of no quantitative change in group mean performance. Incidence was higher for the older groups, with 16.3% to 29.6% of cases developing MCI-DS and another 6.1% to 18.5% developing dementia, both increasing monotonically with age. By 18 months, only a single case in the oldest group had developed dementia but there were 15 cases of MCI-DS across the three oldest groups combined, for an overall estimated case incidence of 0.126. This suggests that a follow-up period of 18 months would be unlikely to yield significant differences between treatment and placebo groups while a 36-month period would be more successful. The older the sample, the greater the opportunity to observe AD-related decline and transition in clinical status, but there is clearly a tradeoff between increased age of inclusion and the size of the eligible population. Again, the present findings suggest that adults with DS in their 50s and older should be a priority, maximizing participation of individuals 55 years of age and older. However, as our understanding of factors modifying risk advances and biomarkers of preclinical AD progression are discovered, opportunities for seeing benefits of treatment in younger adults may present themselves, perhaps even over briefer periods of time.

Finally, it is critically important to select primary and secondary outcome measures with empirical support demonstrating sensitivity to the transition from preclinical to prodromal AD. The present results suggest that tasks placing demands on working memory are strong candidates, and a variety of such tasks are included in the assessment batteries in current use by several groups examining AD progression in adults with DS. No doubt, other cognitive domains are affected as AD transitions from its preclinical to prodromal stage (eg, attention27). As Hithersay et al. indicated, practicality is an important consideration, and the field needs a set of informative procedures that can be completed in an hour or less. The important lesson of the present analyses is that some tasks selected based on intuitive promise can be uninformative, the TSI being a present case in point. No clinical trial, whether focused on prevention or treatment, should rely on any task without explicit empirical support for its sensitivity and specificity. Further, prospective participants need to be screened to ensure that they perform significantly above floor to allow quantification of future decline and below ceiling to ensure that subtle declines associated with early MCI-DS will not be masked for higher-functioning individuals able to maintain “perfect” performance as AD continues to progress (a familiar concern for clinicians evaluating intellectually gifted adults). Of course, the severe declines associated with more advanced AD progression will be obvious enough even with relatively casual evaluation, but that is a very different circumstance.

The present findings support a fairly complicated set of recommendations for structuring prevention trials focused on AD in adults with DS, especially regarding appropriate inclusion criteria and screening methods. While the simplicity of implementation proposed by Hithersay et al.5 would seem to have obvious advantages, simply targeting adults between the ages of 36 and 40–45, they might underestimate the complexity involved in real-world assessment of early AD progression in adults with DS. The present analyses support alternative recommendations that might better help guide the design of these future clinical trials.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: This paper focuses on recommendations for future randomized clinical trials (RCTs) targeting prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and enrolling adults with Down syndrome (DS). Archived longitudinal data were examined to quantify change over a 3-year period for adults with DS with presumptive preclinical AD. Relevant literature was reviewed and cited appropriately.

Interpretation: Declines over a 3-year period were unlikely prior to 46 years of age, suggesting that enrollment of younger adults with DS in future RCTs focused on AD prevention would be unable to show differences between treatment and placebo groups.

Future directions: Discovery of disease-modifying treatments for AD is a high priority, nationally and internationally. RCTs enrolling adults with DS can make critically important contributions toward advancing this goal, but the success of these RCTs depend on effective selection of participants and outcome measures.
