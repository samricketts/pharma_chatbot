pmcINTRODUCTION

Cognitive impairment and dementia represent a significant departure from the trajectory of normal cognitive aging due to the aberrant accrual of pathogenic molecular and cellular pathway imbalances of vascular and nonvascular origins, which in turn lead to synaptic disconnection and neuronal loss in higher-order cognitive brain regions. This review combines data from foundational studies and recent breakthrough observations to summarize current thinking on several vascular, nonvascular, and common mechanisms underlying the clinical presentation of Alzheimer disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

Genetic and Modifiable Risk Factors for Dementia

Dementia subtypes arise from multifactorial causes that likely involve interactions among biological aging, genetic factors, and environmental influences. Differential degrees of interaction among these factors may influence variations in age of onset, disease duration, and neuropathological patterns underlying dementia subtypes.1

AD is a polygenic disorder with multiple genetic components affecting the likelihood of disease onset and people who have a first-degree relative with AD are more likely to succumb to the disease.2 Familial forms of AD (&lt;5% cases) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner through point-mutations and deletion-mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes and result in early-onset AD (EOAD), typically presenting during the fourth to sixth decade of life.2 The mutated EOAD gene products are all dysfunctional in the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which aggregate to form the nidus of amyloid plaque pathology (see later discussion).1 Late-onset AD (LOAD, age &gt; 65), however, is significantly associated with several genetic risk factors, with the inheritance of the APOE ε4 allele increasing disease likelihood and lowering age of onset by dysregulating lipid transport, altering blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and promoting vascular amyloid deposition.3 Other factors that confer risk for LOAD include single nucleotide polymorphisms in CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, ABCA7, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1, and the MS4A cluster.4,5 Many of these genes encode components of innate immunity pathways in the brain.

By contrast, ~ 40% of FTD patients have a positive family history with ~ 10% demonstrating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.6 To date, more than 10 genes have been linked to FTD, with MAPT, PGRN, and C9orf72 accounting for ~ 60% of familial FTD.7 Less common mutations associated with familial FTD occur in the VCP, CHMP2B, TARDBP, FUS, SQSTM1, CHCHD10, TBK1, OPTN, CCNF, and TIA1 genes, which cumulatively account for less than 5% of all FTD cases.8 Regarding potential mechanisms of disease related to these mutations, it is notable that MAPT encodes the tau protein involved in tauopathies, whereas PGRN (encoding progranulin) and TARDBP (encoding TAR DNA binding protein 43 [TDP-43]) result in TDP-43 pathologic conditions in FTD (see later discussion).

The genetic basis of DLB is elusive yet there is potential genetic overlap between DLB, FTD, and AD. For example, PSEN1 mutations have also been detected in DLB and FTD patients.9,10 Similarly, mutations in MAPT, PGRN, and C9orf72 have been found in patients diagnosed with DLB and AD.11,12 Moreover, APOE ε4 inheritance also influences risk for DLB and FTD,13,14 and mutations in the SCNA and GBA genes associated with Parkinson disease (PD) are associated with DLB.15 However, the extent to which these genes are linked independently to multiple dementing disorders or represent mixed dementia causes remains unclear.

Finally, mutations in the NOTCH3 gene result in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarct and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). The NOTCH3-encoded protein directs cell fate, and CADASIL-associated mutations result in smooth muscle cell degeneration as well as pericyte and endothelial cell dysfunction, resulting in impaired permeability and perfusion and, ultimately, multiple subcortical strokes and VaD (~30% of patients aged younger than 60 years).16

Nongenetic factors associated with dementia include age, sex, and modifiable comorbidities arising from environmental and lifestyle factors. For instance, the Lancet Commission, an international panel of dementia epidemiology experts, identified 12 modifiable risk factors across the life span that, irrespective of diet, collectively increase the risk for dementia by ~ 40%: less education (early life); hypertension, obesity, hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, and alcohol abuse (midlife, ages ~ 45–66 years); and physical inactivity, diabetes, social inactivity, depression, smoking, and air pollution (late life).17

Vascular Mechanisms of Dementia

Dementia was considered a vascular disease for decades before the identification of AD-related plaque and tangle pathologic conditions,18 after which the consideration of vascular causes of dementia lost attention. Two key findings brought vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia back to the forefront: (1) the observation that dementia occurring purely because of vascular injury or dysfunction (ie, VaD) accounts for 10%–20% of dementia cases, and (2) the discovery that all major forms of dementia have a vascular component that exacerbates the disease.19 The vascular component of dementia frequently takes the form of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD),20 which can manifest as poststroke dementia, subcortical vascular encephalopathy, strategic and multi-infarct dementia, and/or mixed dementia21 through mechanisms involving excitotoxicity, reactive oxygen species generation, BBB breakdown, neuroinflammation, and cell death.22

Hypertension is a leading cause of cerebral SVD and a modifiable risk factor for the development of dementia.23 Regulating blood pressure to less than 140 mm Hg reduces dementia risk24 and lowering blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg reduces the white matter hyperintensities and brain atrophy associated with dementia.25 The deleterious effects of hypertension on brain perfusion are a clear mechanistic link to dementia risk. The brain has a limited capacity to store energy, so when localized neural activity increases, blood flow to that region must follow suit. This functional hyper-emic response provides the oxygen and glucose needed for neuronal function while also removing the metabolites produced by neuronal activity. This process, known as neurovascular coupling, is impaired in patients with hypertension.26

Capillaries are the smallest segments of the cerebral vascular bed, yet dysfunction in their role in gas and nutrient exchange is likely to affect cognitive function. Capillary endothelial cells play a central role in activating the mechanisms that drive neurovascular coupling. Neuronal activity increases extracellular potassium, which causes a retrograde hyperpolarization of the capillary cells up to the arterioles, where it produces dilation, thereby increasing blood flow to the capillary bed.27 Recent studies have shown that conducted vasodilation and neurovascular coupling are impaired in blood pressure high (BPH)/2 genetically hypertensive mice and can be corrected by normalizing blood pressure with a calcium channel blocker.28

Parenchymal arterioles (PAs) branching from the pial vessels are also important determinants of cognitive function. PAs are not connected by collateral branches, and the occlusion of a single PA is sufficient to produce cognitive impairment.29 Thus, PAs are often described as a weak link in an otherwise resilient vascular system.30 PAs account for 30% to 40% of cerebrovascular resistance,31 so small reductions in PA dilator capacity can significantly impair the perfusion of the white matter, which receives most of its blood supply through these arterioles.30

We have linked impaired endothelium-dependent dilation to the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel,32 which transports calcium into the endothelial cells to activate endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization and regulate blood flow.33 We have shown that inhibiting soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), which reduces the activity of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid TRPV4 ligands, improves cognitive function in a model of hypertensive chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.34 Importantly, sEH expression is increased in patients with VaD and sEH inhibition improves cognitive function in models of AD.35

Finally, reduced vascular capacity for the clearance of waste from the brain to cervical lymph nodes may represent another mechanism conferring dementia risk. In addition to impairments in neurovascular coupling driven by SVD such as hypertension, impairments in the glymphatic system, which facilitates perivascular drainage of waste products from the brain by arterial pulsation,36 and intramural periarterial drainage, which clears waste—including soluble proteins such as Aβ—along the basement membranes of smooth muscle cells,37 have gained attention. In this regard, glymphatic clearance is also perturbed in hypertensive models.38 Thus, there are multiple mechanisms by which cerebral SVD and associated vascular lesions impact the development of dementia.

Nonvascular Mechanisms of Dementia—Proteinopathies

A notable commonality among nonvascular dementias is the spectrum of proteinopathies—or accrual of aggregated protein deposits—that define these disorders. Despite variability in the specific protein involved and differential spatiotemporal patterns of deposition, proteinopathies share pathologic signatures including beta-sheet fibrillar aggregates, “prion-like” spread in the brain, activation of immune responses, and evidence for disease-related deficits in clearance.39 Overlapping proteinopathies are also common despite a clinical presentation suggesting a singular disease (eg, many patients diagnosed antemortem with AD display mixed pathologic conditions on postmortem evaluation).40 The 4 most relevant proteinopathies are tauopathy, amyloid pathology, synucleinopathy, and TDP-43 pathology.

Tauopathies including AD and FTD subtypes such as behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy are characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation comprising highly phosphorylated moieties of the protein tau (the product of MAPT). Tau is a microtubule-binding protein predominantly located in the axon. Besides its function in microtubule stabilization in the axon, monomeric tau is involved in multiple cellular pathways including cell signaling.41 Tauopathy is variably accompanied by other proteinopathies including amyloid pathology in AD, synucleinopathy in DLB and AD, and TDP-43pathology in FTD (see later discussion). Although the cascade of events leading from monomeric tau to NFTs is not fully known, oligomeric tau intermediates confer neurotoxicity through a diverse array of mechanisms including the impairment of synaptic function and long-term potentiation (LTP) resulting in learning and memory deficits,42 autophagic-lysosomal pathways resulting in the accumulation of damaged proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction,43 axonal trafficking,41 and genomic stability.44

Amyloid pathology in the form of plaques and amyloid angiopathy in AD and DLB results from the aggregation of Aβ peptides. Similar to tau, Aβ toxicity seems to be due to soluble, diffusible oligomeric (oAβ) intermediates. oAβ also impairs LTP, possibly through overactivation of NMDA receptors.45 oAβ-mediated LTP impairment has also been linked to Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.46 oAβ also mediates neuronal excitotoxicity by increasing presynaptic glutamate release and disrupting postsynaptic glutamate receptor function.47 Intriguingly, oAβ was found to promote hyperphosphorylation of tau by activating tau kinases, which leads to the formation of NFTs.46 Finally, oAβ also impairs insulin signaling, which plays a role in Aβ clearance from the brain.48

Synucleinopathy arises from the aggregation of the presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn, the protein product of SCNA).49 Fibrillar aggregates of α -syn are the major constituents of Lewy bodies, the pathologic hallmark of Lewy body diseases including dementing subtypes such as DLB and PD with dementia.50 Functionally, a-syn seems to regulate presynaptic vesicle transport by binding SNARE complexes.51 Pre-Lewy body oligomeric forms of α-syn (o-α-syn) cause cellular toxicity via mechanisms including damage to mitochondrial respiration and ATP production52 with resulting increases in oxidative stress.53 O-α-syn has also been linked to disruptions of the autophagic-lysosomal pathway,54 which in turn likely results in the further accumulation of pathologic aggregates of α-syn. Along with synucleinopathy, amyloid pathology is another feature of DLB50; however, the extent to which these 2 proteinopathies independently or synergistically promote disease progression remains undefined.

Another proteinopathy consists of the nuclear TDP-43 (the protein product of TARDBP). TDP-43 aggregates are associated with FTD subtypes including bvFTD and CBD (both with concomitant tauopathy) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.55 TDP-43 pathology is also commonly seen in AD56 and the recently recognized dementia subtype, limbic-predominant age-related TPD-43 encephalopathy (LATE).57 These disorders display cytoplasmic phosphorylated and ubiquitinated TDP-43 inclusions that strongly correlate with neurodegeneration.55,57 Physiologically, TDP-43 orchestrates RNA splicing, transport, and translation,55 so clinically distinct neurologic diseases associated with cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions may be related to impaired chromatin remodeling, RNA metabolism, and impaired mitochondrial and stress–response pathways such as the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response.58

Common Mechanisms of Dementia—Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction

Oxidative stress is a common theme among proteinopathies (eg, oxidative/nitrative damage to tau, Aβ, α-syn, and TDP-43 may promote their aggregation)59,60 and/or vascular damage (as part of the ischemic cascade).18 The brain is at particular risk for oxidative damage because it uses 20% of the body’s oxygen supply and yet is relatively depleted of antioxidant defenses (eg, brain tissue production of catalase is ~ 10%–20% of that in liver and heart).61 Notably, even subjects who come to autopsy with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a putative prodromal stage of AD and related dementias, display differential cellular levels of macromolecular oxidative damage, decreased antioxidant defenses, and mitochondrial dysfunction, underscoring the potentially prominent pathogenic role for dysregulated redox balance and cellular respiration during disease progression.59,62,63

Oxidative stress associated with MCI and AD includes: (1) protein carbonylation produced by amino acid oxidation or advanced glycation end product formation, (2) protein nitrosylation from superoxide radicals reacting with nitric oxide, (3) nuclear and mitochondrial DNA as well as RNA oxidation from hydroxyl radical damage, and (4) lipid peroxidation such as F2-isoprostanes and F4-isoprostanes and hydroxynonenal (HNE) aldehyde protein adducts in key cognitive regions such as hippocampus and cortex.59,63–65 Oxidative stress markers have also been noted in plaques and NFTs.66

Increased lipid peroxidation and HNE were also noted in FTD.67 Stem cell-derived neurons bearing tau mutations from patients with FTD and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 displayed mitochondrial perturbations including reduced respiration and lower ATP production, which in turn were associated with higher levels of superoxide production and lipid peroxidation compared with control neurons.68 Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are also associated with DLB as studies using frozen cortex from patients revealed dysregulation of mitochondrial subunit expression and reduced activity of complexes I, II, III, and IV of the respiratory chain.69 Oxidative damage in DLB has also been noted in the widespread distribution of neurons and glia bearing markers for protein nitration70 and higher cortical levels of oxidized cholesterol compared with controls,71 as well as oxidation and nitration of reflect Greek alpha and Lewy bodies.66

The mechanisms underlying increased oxidative stress remain unclear. Normal cellular metabolism produces low concentrations of reactive oxygen species and reactive aldehydes (eg, HNE), which play important roles as signaling molecules to regulate cell differentiation, cell signaling, cell survival, and immune responses.72 However, cell damage could be perpetuated by feed-forward cycles whereby increased oxidative stress leads to damaged mitochondrial DNA and respiratory chain subunits resulting in impaired mitochondrial function and increased levels of free radicals.73 Notably, MCI is also characterized by impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, increased fission and mitophagy, and aberrant mitochondrial unfolded protein responses.73,74 Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia also involve mitochondrial stress and dysfunction from focal hypoxia, which may trigger this vicious cycle via pro-oxidant enzymes such as NADPH oxidase 1.75 In addition, the relatively insufficient antioxidant defense system of the brain is further compromised during disease pathogenesis. For instance, others and we have shown that the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase are significantly reduced in plasma and vulnerable brain regions in MCI/AD.62,76,77 Furthermore, in vivo imaging studies have shown that reduced brain glutathione levels correlate with poorer cognitive performance in MCI and AD subjects.78

Finally, cellular loss of ATP from dysfunctional mitochondria leads to dysregulated ion gradients and membrane depolarization resulting in impaired action potentials and Ca2+ dyshomeostasis.79 Hence, the cumulative toll of oxidized DNA/RNA, oxidative/nitrative protein damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired ATP production is the significant perturbation of synaptic activity necessary for maintaining cognitive function.18,73,79 Finally, oxidative stress is also associated with increased neuroinflammation by driving glial expression of proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors, as described below.

Common Mechanisms of Dementia—Neuroinflammation

Abnormal, silver-stained glial cells were among the pathologic conditions noted in the first, seminal reports from Dr Alzheimer. Modern immunohistochemical methods subsequently detailed increased immune system-related proteins produced by reactive microglia and astrocytes in AD, including complement proteins, major histocompatibility complex I and II proteins, integrins such as CD11b and CD18, and a myriad of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins IL-1b and IL-6 and the tumor necrosis factor, TNFa.80,81 Binding of these integrin and cytokine to their cognate receptors initiates second messenger pathways (eg, MAP and JUN kinases, nuclear factor-kappa B activator protein 1 transcription factors) to induce immune amplification via the production of additional cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, prostaglandins, proteolytic enzymes, and a variety of other factors, which can even result in apoptosis or necrosis.82–84

These glial changes were initially thought to represent cellular responses to amyloid plaques and NFTs and/or degenerating neurons. However, a paradigm shift from the concept of “reactive gliosis” occurred when multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving tens to hundreds of thousands of subjects identified 30 to 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms linked to AD risk, with a large proportion associated with immune function.85 More recently, a landmark GWAS study involving 111,326 AD cases and 677,663 controls identified 75 total polymorphisms associated with disease risk, among which 33 were novel and primarily associated with microglial function and TNFα pathways.86 Considered together, these data suggest that glial functions could contribute to causing disease pathogenesis, rather than merely responding to it. Neuroinflammation is hypothesized to be a major component of FTD87 and LBD,88 as well as in VaD where inflammatory responses are associated with hypertension, BBB damage, and stroke.18 Here, we will focus on neuroinflammation in AD because this has been extensively researched and likely involves mechanisms common among dementia subtypes.

With respect to alterations in glial cells in AD and related dementias, transcriptomic signatures identified subtypes of microglia and astrocytes associated with disease and injury.89 In microglia, these cells have been termed “disease-associated microglia” (DAM)90 and “microglia associated with neurodegeneration” (MGnD).91 DAM/MgNDs display reductions in homeostatic genes and increases in genes associated with innate immune activation and genetic risk factors for AD. Two genetic risk factors for AD, APOE and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), are required for the conversion from the homeostatic to the DAM/MGnD phenotype.91 The activated microglia secrete factors such as C1q, interleukin IL-1α, and TNFα that induce astrocyte activation to the neurotoxic, reactive A1 phenotype.92 Interestingly, the secondary structure of Aβ is sufficient to interact with microglial receptors such as TREM2 and toll-like receptors, directly stimulating innate immunity secretory pathways and phagocytosis.93 Because amyloid pathology in AD accumulates late in the life span, there could be no selection pressure on microglia to evolve specific mechanisms for Aβ removal. This likely represents another impaired clearance mechanism for amyloid and may be relevant for other proteinopathies.

Complement activation is another critical arm of innate immunity. Initially, complement C1q binds to a target antigen and initiates a cascade of protease activation. Cleavage products C3b and C4b “opsonize” structures, tagging them for removal by phagocytes such as microglia, while other cleavage products, C3a and C5a, elicit cytokine secretion, B cell stimulation, smooth muscle contraction, and capillary leakage.94 The Aβ peptide is capable of binding C1q and activating the complement cascade.95 oAβ causes some synapses to become decorated with C1q, which triggers opsonization by C3 and synaptic stripping and may play a key role in the presentation of dementia.96,97 Genetic or pharmacologic interruption of C1q, C3, or C5 signaling prevented synapse loss, cognitive impairment and, in some situations, amyloid accumulation in mouse models.96–98

Complement activation may also play a role in VaD and is related to both chronic hypoperfusion99 and amyloid angiopathy.100 Notably, cross talk between complement and coagulation pathways results in prothrombic roles for both C3a and C5a.94 Human cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells secrete complement proteins leading to lytic injury, loss of vessel integrity, and potentially even exacerbating amyloid angiopathy and cognitive function.101 In addition, genetic deletion or pharmacologic antagonism of C3a receptors protected against cerebral ischemia caused by bilateral common carotid stenosis in a mouse model of VaD.102

SUMMARY

We have highlighted the current understanding of several major genetic, environmental/lifestyle, and cellular molecular mechanistic pathways associated with vascular and non-VaDs—as well as common mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation—that together exacerbate neuronal, glial, and vascular cell function in higher-order cognitive brain regions to result in neurodegeneration, synapse loss, and ultimately, cognitive impairment and dementia (Fig. 1). Additional potential pathogenic mechanisms, which are likely influenced by these mechanisms, include aberrant intracellular trafficking, especially along endosomal-autophagy-lysosomal and stress pathways,103,104 imbalances in neurotrophic signaling that favor proapoptotic pathways,105,106 epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation,107,108 and dysbiosis of the gut–brain axis.109 We posit that disease modification for these devastating disorders requires the development of combinatorial therapies that mitigate these molecular pathway imbalances and promote cellular homeostasis in the aging brain.
