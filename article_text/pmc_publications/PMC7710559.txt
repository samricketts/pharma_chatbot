Dr. Mark Mattson has had a highly productive and impactful tenure as a neuroscientist at the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging. He has made notable contributions to understanding the mechanisms by which energetic stress, imparted by behaviors such as physical activity and periods of fasting, promotes rejuvenation and resilience within brain regions critical for learning and memory. In honor of Dr. Mattson’s work, this manuscript will highlight the fascinating mechanisms by which endurance exercise training conveys beneficial effects upon the structure and function of the nervous system; that is, by mediating the synthesis and secretion of factors that directly support brain homeostasis, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, FNDC5/irisin, ketone bodies, growth factors, cathepsin B, serotonin, and 4-hydroxynonenal. The molecular and cellular effects of these factors are discussed herein. In the face of population aging and an overwhelming surge in the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, Dr. Mattson’s work as a champion and role model for physically active lifestyles is more important than ever.

Introduction: On your Mark!

The transformation of human societies from preindustrial, to industrial, to postindustrial has been paralleled by changes in the threats to human health and longevity. In this digital era, sedentary lifestyles, limitless supplies of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse are widely recognized for their influence on the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, respiratory diseases, and diabetes; the major drivers of disability and death amongst older adults. Modifiable lifestyle factors also significantly impact later-life cognitive health and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Throughout his impressive career at the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Mark Mattson’s pioneering discoveries have illuminated the beneficial effects of energetic stress—elicited by physical activity or eating patterns—on the aging brain. Herein, we highlight the research of Dr. Mattson and his colleagues, which has provided critical insights into the mechanisms by which endurance exercise training robustly counters neuroprogression and optimizes late-life brain structure, function, and resilience.

Aging is the greatest risk for vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal disorders, and AD, the most common form of dementia characterized by a decline in memory with a loss of independence. The social and economic impacts of dementia are profound, and the prevalence of AD alone is expected to triple by 2060 (Matthews et al., 2019). The biology of AD in particular remains elusive, however hallmarks of brain aging, including loss of plasticity and volume, are prominent (Greenwood and Parasuraman, 2010). Similar neuroprogressive features are evident if not accelerated in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease after AD. Moreover, there is evidence for accelerated aging across multiple processes involved in neuroprogression in mental health conditions, including depression and anxiety (Perna et al., 2016; Ruiz et al., 2018), which further amplify risk for dementia (Becker et al., 2018; Donovan et al., 2018). While overt loss of cognitive abilities such as memory and decision-making manifests in later life, the underlying biology is undoubtedly in process throughout the life course. This has fueled the search for interventions that can alter the rate or trajectory of brain aging.

Grey Matt(son)er: Exercise and the Brain

Exercise, in its various forms (e.g., endurance, resistance, and high-intensity interval training), confers distinct benefits upon nearly all human organs and physiological systems (e.g., metabolic, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, immune, and digestive) throughout the lifespan. Importantly, this includes powerful effects of endurance exercise on the brain and nervous system. As a striking example, Erickson and colleagues conducted a trial of endurance exercise training (moderate-intensity treadmill walking three days/week) in adults 55 to 80 years of age (Erickson et al., 2011). At the end of the one-year intervention period, participants in the endurance exercise group exhibited a 2% increase in hippocampal volume that positively correlated with improvements in spatial memory. In contrast, participants in the stretching control group exhibited the expected age-related decrease in hippocampal volume (1–2%). Notably, this was partially attenuated in participants with higher baseline cardiorespiratory fitness.

The Mattson Laboratory has provided fundamental insights into how exercise drives cellular and structural adaptations within the brain using rodent models of aging and disease. Like humans, rodents exhibit improvements in both spatial (van Praag et al., 1999b) and non-spatial learning (O’Callaghan et al., 2007) in response to endurance exercise training (e.g., running and swimming). These enhancements in memory are accompanied by exercise-induced proliferation, survival, and differentiation of neuronal progenitors in the dentate gyrus (van Praag et al., 1999a; van Praag et al., 1999b). Moreover, running has been shown to fortify the organization of and communication within neuronal networks, which could have beneficial impacts on memory and spatial-temporal information processing (Vivar et al., 2016). Importantly, exercise-induced neuronal adaptations are accompanied by the proliferation of endothelial cells and angiogenesis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Van der Borght et al., 2009; van Praag et al., 2005). Vascular modifications in the brain in response to endurance exercise plausibly defend against small vessel disease, evidenced by white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts, which significantly increase risk for vascular cognitive impairment and vascular dementia (Roman et al., 2002).

The widespread effects of exercise are attributable to its multifactorial nature; that is, exercise encompasses metabolic, mechanical, hemodynamic, hormonal and neuronal stimuli that individually and synergistically drive cellular adaptations. The energetic stress of endurance exercise is undoubtedly a key mediator of its regenerative and protective actions on the nervous system, as many of the beneficial effects are comparable to time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting, interventions comprehensively studied by Mattson and colleagues that are highlighted in accompanying reports (Editor please add references). One mechanism through which energetic stress triggers cellular responses locally and globally is through the production and secretion of a multitude of circulating factors, which beneficially upregulate stress-response pathways, induce vascularization, stimulate mitochondrial reorganization and biogenesis, and promote synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. These fascinating mediators of exercise are discussed in the paragraphs below, and underscore the potential of exercise itself to serve as a powerful, scalable intervention to optimize cognitive and mental health throughout the lifespan (Figure 1).

Circulating Factors that Mediate the Effects of Exercise

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

BDNF is a secreted protein that contributes to the development and maintenance of the nervous system. It is highly expressed in the brain, and to a lesser extent in cardiac muscle, lung, kidney, spleen, and other peripheral tissues (Marosi and Mattson, 2014). With advancing age, there is evidence for reduced BDNF expression, secretion, and signaling (Mattson et al., 2004a) (Table 1). Importantly, studies by Dr. Mattson and colleagues have demonstrated that physical exercise can positively influence BDNF abundance and action (Mattson, 2012a).

As a neuroprotective agent, BDNF defends neurons against the metabolic, excitotoxic, and oxidative challenges of aging and aging-related conditions such as AD and PD (Cheng and Mattson, 1994; Mattson, 2002). It also promotes neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and stress resistance (Marosi and Mattson, 2014). BDNF exerts such effects by activating its high affinity receptor, tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) (Marosi et al., 2016a). BDNF-induced TrkB dimerization triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3-K), and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) pathways (Mattson et al., 2004a; Numakawa et al., 2018; Reichardt, 2006). Additionally, BDNF activates apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE-1), a DNA base excision repair enzyme that mitigates oxidative damage, through the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) (Yang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2010). BDNF also reduces amyloid beta plaque aggregation through TrkB. Collectively, these effectors mediate the protective actions of BDNF against the pathological mechanisms of age-related cognitive decline, AD and PD (Arancibia et al., 2008; Nigam et al., 2017b).

Studies of heterozygous BDNF knockout mice have demonstrated its vital role at the behavioral, tissue, and cellular level (Rothman et al., 2012). For example, BDNF-deficient rodents exhibit impaired learning and memory (Linnarsson et al., 1997; Mizuno et al., 2000), decreased neural stem cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival (Lee et al., 2002; Numakawa et al., 2018), and obesity (Rothman et al., 2012). Notably, compromised BDNF and TrkB activity dampens the beneficial effects of exercise on synaptic plasticity and neuronal health (Krakowiak, Liu et al. 2015, Marosi, Mattson et al. 2013). Moreover, when treated with a BDNF antibody, mice given access to a running wheel failed to demonstrate improvements in cognitive outcomes compared to vehicle-treated mice (Vaynman et al., 2004a). This illustrates the crucial role of BDNF in mediating the benefits of exercise. Of note, the therapeutic effects of dietary restriction and even antidepressants are also compromised in BDNF-deficient animals (Duan et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Li et al., 2008).

In contrast, exogenous BDNF administration to aged, diseased, or BDNF-depleted rodents has been shown to restore aspects of cognitive and physical health, including improved long term potentiation (LTP), insulin sensitivity, and cardiovascular regulation (Mattson et al., 2004b; Rothman et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2010), underscoring its therapeutic potential. Importantly, exercise, and other energetic challenges such as intermittent fasting and caloric restriction, significantly increase endogenous BDNF levels (Griffin et al., 2011; Mattson et al., 2004b; Rothman et al., 2012; Schafer et al., 2015). The distance run by rats given a running wheel correlated strongly with BDNF mRNA levels in critical hippocampal regions (Neeper et al., 1995). Exercise-associated improvements in hippocampal volume and spatial memory in older adults, as noted above, were associated with changes in circulating concentrations of BDNF (Erickson et al., 2011). The mechanisms through which exercise promotes BDNF abundance and signaling is an active area of investigation; however, activation of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) signaling by endurance exercise in both the brain and skeletal muscle has been implicated (Wrann et al., 2013). The brain is the primary, but not sole source of circulating BDNF during rest and in response to exercise, with marked increases in Bdnf expression most notably occurring in the hippocampus (Matthews et al., 2009; Seifert et al., 2010). The expression and abundance of BDNF is also increased in skeletal muscle fibers with contractile activity, where it stimulates fat oxidation (Matthews et al., 2009), but it is not evident that skeletal muscle contributes to circulating concentrations.

FNDC5/Irisin

Irisin was first described as a muscle-derived and -secreted protein, or myokine, generated from the precursor fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5)(Boström et al., 2012). Challenges inherent to its measurement generated skepticism regarding its physiological role; however, more sensitive and specific methods to quantify FNDC5/irisin have substantiated its function and regulation by exercise (Jedrychowski et al., 2015). FNDC5/irisin is found in circulation and in multiple tissues including the brain and skeletal muscle and is known to promote synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection (Lourenco et al., 2019; Wrann et al., 2013) (Table 1). Depletion of FNDC5/irisin results in the significant reduction of neuron differentiation and survival, leading to the loss of LTP and recognition memory (Lourenco et al., 2019; Wrann, 2015). FNDC5/irisin has also been identified as a key mediator of BDNF expression, making it an attractive target in investigating age-related neurodegeneration (Marosi and Mattson, 2014). FNDC5/irisin levels are markedly reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of adults diagnosed with AD or Lewy body dementia and in mice that were infused with Aβ oligomers to model harmful AD aggregates (Lourenco et al., 2019). Mice subjected to a daily swimming exercise for five weeks demonstrate higher FNDC5/irisin levels and BDNF expression than their sedentary counterparts (Lourenco et al., 2019). Several studies have also reported increased FNDC5/irisin levels in response to aerobic exercises such as swimming and running (Wrann, 2015). Remarkably, upregulation of FNDC5/irisin levels through aerobic exercise recovered hippocampal synaptic plasticity and improved performance on novel object recognition tasks in AD mouse models (Lourenco et al., 2019).

Ketone Bodies

The energy demands of endurance exercise can stimulate the generation of the ketone body D-β-hydroxybutyrate (DBHB) by the liver. Interestingly, Sleiman et al. found that DBHB can travel to the brain through circulation and accumulate in the hippocampus (Sleiman et al., 2016) (Table 1). Exercise-induced metabolic changes further influence the regulation of BDNF (Koppel and Timmusk, 2013). DBHB serves as an energy source for the brain and activates Bdnf expression. It partly functions through the inhibition of the histone deacetylases HDAC2 and HDAC3, which are responsible for the epigenetic downregulation of Bdnf through transcriptional inhibition of Bdnf promoter I (Koppel and Timmusk, 2013). 3-hydroxybutyrate (3OHB) is another ketone body which induces BDNF expression. Marosi et al. found increased 3OHB levels in mouse plasma after exercise and confirmed that cerebral cortical neurons exposed to 3OHB in vitro have significantly higher BDNF expression. This action of 3OHB is mediated through an interaction between histone acetyltransferase p300 and NF-κB (Marosi et al., 2016a).

Growth Factors

Growth factors such as IGF-1 can serve both anti- and pro-aging roles. On the one hand, there is evidence from multiple research models that IGF-1 acts as a pro-aging factor. Mutations in IGF-1 receptor daf-2 significantly increased lifespan of C. elegans (Kenyon et al., 1993). Additionally, Ames dwarf mice, which lack growth hormone and have very low serum levels of IGF-1, also show significantly extended lifespan compared to control mice (Brown-Borg et al., 1996). In humans, a study of centenarians found an increased frequency of heterozygous IGF-1 receptor mutations, suggesting that reduced IGF-1 signaling promotes longevity (Suh et al., 2008). On the other hand, IGF-1 can induce stress response pathways, promote synaptic plasticity, and exert neuroprotective functions in animal models of AD (reviewed by (Mattson et al., 2004b)) (Table 1). Additionally, there is evidence that IGF-1 mediates the beneficial effects of exercise. Endurance exercise transiently increases circulating IGF-1, which was found to be neuroprotective (Carro et al., 2001) and promote neurogenesis (Carro et al., 2001). A recent study found that overexpression of IGF-1 in the CNS increased brain volume and myelin density in aged male mice, as well as countered depressive-like behavior and motor decline. (Farias Quipildor et al., 2019). These benefits were not significant in female mice. The authors further demonstrated that short-term intranasal administration of IGF-1 directly to the CNS also improved parameters of learning and memory in aged male mice. These studies highlight the complexity of IGF-1 as a pro-aging factor in the periphery, yet a neuroprotective factor in the CNS, that may act in a sex-specific manner (Farias Quipildor et al., 2019).

VEGF also gradually declines with age, impairing fundamental processes such as neurogenesis in critical brain regions like the hippocampus (Shetty et al., 2005). Aerobic exercise has been found to boost serum VEGF levels in aged mouse models, restoring plasticity through improved vasculature in the brain and providing heightened neuroprotection against hypoxic and excitotoxic stress (Ding et al., 2006; Mattson, 2012b; Shetty et al., 2005) (Table 1). Akin to BDNF, VEGF stimulates neurogenesis but is also responsible for promoting angiogenesis, which improves the transport of nutrients, oxygen, and waste to and from metabolically active tissues like the brain and skeletal muscle (Baek, 2016; Mattson, 2012b). Like BDNF and IGF-1, exogenous VEGF can mimic the beneficial actions of endurance exercise on the hippocampi of sedentary mice by stimulating neuronal differentiation and proliferation (Fabel et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2002). Blocking VEGF signaling blunts these effects, indicating that VEGF is also an important mediator of exercise-induced neurovascular adaptations in the brain (Fabel et al., 2003).

The beneficial effects of BDNF are, in part, reinforced through other exercise-induced growth factors, including IGF-1 and VEGF. Through downstream pathways that are similar to those activated by BDNF, these growth factors drive synaptic plasticity and stress resistance (Cotman et al., 2007) (Mattson et al., 2004b).

Cathepsins B (CTSB)

CTSB is a cysteine protease widely expressed in human tissues (Chapman et al., 1997). It degrades the endolysosomal proteins from endocytosis or phagocytosis, and extracellular matrix proteins in pathological conditions (Buck et al., 1992; Chapman et al., 1997). In AD, CTSB is considered to be a candidate β-secretase, which influences amyloid beta accumulation through proteolytic cleavage (Hook et al., 2005; Mueller-Steiner et al., 2006). CTSB abundance is increased in skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, a tissue from which it is secreted by in mice, rhesus monkeys, and humans (Moon et al., 2016) (Table 1). The beneficial effects of running on hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory in wild type mice were attenuated in CTSB deficient mice, suggesting CTSB acts as a mediator between exercise and the structure and function of neuronal tissue. Based on in vitro studies, CTSB may cross the blood-brain barrier and enhance the expression and/or abundance of hippocampal P11 (S100A10), doublecortin, and BDNF (Moon et al., 2016). In a cohort of healthy, young women and men, plasma levels of CTSB were increased after four months of treadmill exercise training and exhibited positive correlations with changes in aerobic fitness and incidental memory (Moon et al., 2016).

Serotonin

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is another prominent signal that regulates neural plasticity, growth, and survival in the brain (Mattson et al., 2004a). 5-HT is a monoamine neurotransmitter produced in neurons in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem in the central nervous system (Berger et al., 2009). It is widely recognized for its antidepressant effects and ability to promote hippocampal neurogenesis (Mahar et al., 2014). 5-HT and BDNF synergistically regulate neural plasticity. 5-HT can stimulate the expression of BDNF, and BDNF promotes 5-HT synthesis following partial membrane depolarization of raphe neurons (Djalali et al., 2005; Eaton and Whittemore, 1996). Exercise increases the synthesis and metabolism of 5-HT in the brain stem and cerebral cortex (Dey et al., 1992) which may further drive neurogenesis (Table 1). Additionally, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2)-deficient mice that lack 5-HT show impaired exercise-induced hippocampal neurogenesis (Klempin et al., 2013). Finally, exercise has also been shown to promote serotonin synthesis by increasing the levels of tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT, in plasma and in the brain (Chaouloff et al., 1985).

4-hydroxynonenal (HNE)

HNE is an aldehydic product of lipid peroxidation (Uchida et al., 1998). It is an important signaling molecule implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. HNE was found to cross-link with numerous protiens at lysine, cysteine, and histidine residues and inhibit proteosomal degradation (Friguet and Szweda, 1997). Dr. Mattson and colleagues found HNE induced by oxidative stress could cause apoptosis in PC-12 cells, a classical neuronal cell model, and primary rat hippocampal neurons (Kruman et al., 1997). HNE is also identified as an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β/δ (PPAR β/δ) (Coleman et al., 2007), which is important for neuronal maturation and BDNF signaling. Together with PPAR β/δ, HNE increase the deterimental BDNF precursor and inhibits the BDNF/TrkB survival pathway during aging and AD progression (Benedetti et al., 2014). Importantly, serum from 24 month old rats had more than twice as much free HNE compared with 7 month old controls (Kim et al., 2006). In a group of 194 healthy individuals aged 18–84 years old, plasma HNE concentration were correlated with age (Pearson correlation R2 = 0.288, p&lt;0.001) (Gil et al., 2006), HNE levels found in ventricular fluid of AD patients were also significant higher than that found in healthy controls (Lovell et al., 1997). Endurance exercise was found to inhibit HNE production and reduce HNE and oxidative stress in the hippocampus (Coleman et al., 2007) (Table 1).

Final Re-Marks

Advances in the biological understanding of aging have led to a search for interventions to delay, prevent, or even cure age-related diseases as a group. Indeed, such therapies would have a transformative impact on human health. Throughout his career, Dr. Mattson has been a vocal champion and a role model for energetic interventions based on lifestyle choices, not pharmacological regimens, that counter the very pillars of aging and, in turn, thwart the diseases and disabilities that compromise human healthspan. Indeed, his work has provided a robust scientific foundation for a number of major initiatives to better understand the effects and scalability of interventions such as time-restricted feeding and intermittent fasting. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues have demonstrated the significant effects of endurance exercise on brain structure and function and provided important insights into mediators of the effects of exercise, including a diverse set of circulating factors. Notably, this has fueled the search for additional molecules involved in inter-organ cross-talk and, in particular, influenced by exercise and aging (e.g., FGF21 (Geng et al., 2019), GDF15 (Conte et al., 2020; Laurens et al., 2020), GPLD1 (Horowitz et al., 2020)). This foundational knowledge can be applied to help optimize both lifestyle and pharmacological approaches to improving cognitive and mental health throughout the life course. In a postindustrial, digital society that faces population aging and an epidemic of obesity, strategies to promote physical activity couldn’t be more important.

Exercise encompasses multiple forms of stress that drive adaptations throughout the system. Dr. Mark Mattson’s work has emphasized the importance of energetic stress as a stimulus for the synthesis and secretion of circulating factors that confer beneficial effects upon multiple organs, including the brain. By promoting neural rejuvenation and plasticity and countering neural progression, endurance exercise is an effective means to optimize cognitive and mental health.
