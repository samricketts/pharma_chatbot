Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) appearing as hypointense foci on T2*-weighted magnetic resonance images are small brain hemorrhages that have been linked to cognitive decline and increased mortality. However, the neuropathologic correlates of CMBs in community-based older adults are poorly understood. The present study investigated the association of age-related neuropathologies with CMBs in the cerebrum, and separately in individual lobes and basal ganglia of community-based older adults. Cerebral hemispheres from 289 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, Religious Orders Study, Minority Aging Research Study, and Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Clinical Core underwent ex-vivo MRI and detailed neuropathologic examination. Following Bonferroni correction, CMBs in the cerebrum overall and in the frontal lobe were associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CMBs in the frontal lobe were also associated with arteriolosclerosis, and CMBs in the basal ganglia showed a borderline significant association with microinfarcts. These findings suggest that CMBs can aid in the prediction of small vessel disease in community-based older adults. Finally, CMBs were not associated with dementia, suggesting that CMBs in community-based older adults may not be linked to substantial cognitive impairment.

pmc1. Introduction

Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) identified as small hypointense foci in T2*-weighted gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are predominantly small brain hemorrhages with local deposition of hemosiderin thereby causing faster signal dephasing (Greenberg et al., 2009; Wardlaw et al., 2013; Puy et al., 2021). In community cohorts of older adults, the presence of CMBs has been associated with age, and prevalence of up to 36% has been reported in persons older than 80 years of age (Poels et al., 2010). CMBs in community-based older adults have been linked to infarcts and white matter hyperintensities (Wiegman et al., 2014; Graff-Radford et al., 2017; Akoudad et al., 2015), lower brain volume (Su et al., 2019), retinal microvascular lesions (Qiu et al., 2008), cognitive decline (Ding et al., 2017; Meier et al., 2014), physical frailty (Chung et al., 2016), and increased mortality (Charidimou et al., 2018). Risk factors for CMBs in community cohorts of older adults include hypertension (Yubi et al., 2018), APOE ε4 homozygosity (Sveinbjornsdottir et al., 2008), and male sex (Graff-Radford et al., 2017). However, the neuropathologic correlates of CMBs in community-based older adults are not well understood.

Prior studies investigating the link between neuropathologies and CMBs have included mostly small clinical cohorts and have shown that cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may be a key contributor to CMBs located in or near the cortex (Charidimou et al., 2017), while hypertensive angiopathy (Charidimou et al., 2016; Puy et al., 2021) may be linked to CMBs in subcortical brain tissue. More specifically, a retrospective study on 55 patients that combined in-vivo MRI and either brain autopsy or brain biopsy showed that the presence of strictly lobar CMBs predicted moderate/severe CAA (Martinez-Ramirez et al., 2015). However, the same work recognized that the link between strictly lobar CMBs and CAA was limited when studying 47 community-based participants, suggesting that further investigation of the neuropathologic correlates of CMBs in community cohorts is warranted. An autopsy and ex-vivo MRI study of 11 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) found that CMBs were more common in patients with CAA than in those with hypertensive ICH (Guidoux et al., 2018). A longitudinal in-vivo MRI investigation of 37 nursing home patients with dementia found a weak association between CAA detected at autopsy and CMBs located in the frontal lobe as well as in deep brain regions (Boyano et al., 2018). In a study of 8 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, 6 of whom exhibited advanced CAA, 79% of CMBs identified in ex-vivo MRI were located near the cortical ribbon and the underlying pathologies included CAA and small lacunar infarcts (Schrag et al., 2010). An investigation of 5 patients with severe CAA and Alzheimer’s pathology found that more than 98% of CMBs detected with ex-vivo MRI were located within the cortex and represented vasculopathies, acute hemorrhages, old hemorrhages with varying degrees of ischemic tissue injury, or hemorrhagic microinfarcts (van Veluw et al., 2016). A study on 71 memory clinic patients that combined in-vivo MRI and amyloid PET showed that patients with strictly lobar CMBs had higher frequency of Aβ positivity and fewer lacunes suggestive of CAA, whereas patients with a combination of lobar and deep CMBs had lower frequency of Aβ positivity and more lacunes suggestive of hypertensive angiopathy (Jung et al., 2020). Despite the converging evidence of a link between lobar CMBs and CAA and a link between deep CMBs and hypertensive angiopathy, the above investigations were conducted on small clinical cohorts, were focused primarily on CAA and in most cases did not control for comorbid neuropathologies. Moreover, those investigations based on in vivo MRI had intervals between in vivo MRI and death on the order of years, allowing additional pathology to develop after MRI data collection, thereby weakening the apparent link between CMBs and pathology.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuropathologic correlates of CMBs in the cerebrum as a whole as well as in individual lobes and in the basal ganglia, in a large number of community-based older adults. Ex-vivo MRI and detailed pathologic evaluation were combined in this work. Ex-vivo MRI ensures that CMBs are captured at the same brain condition as pathologic examination and enables the inclusion of older adults that may have been too frail to undergo in-vivo MRI. Ex-vivo MRI assessment of CMBs has previously been validated (Nag et al., 2021). Detailed pathologic examination assessed gross and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, CAA, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, Lewy bodies, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). The association of CMB counts with this comprehensive array of neuropathologies was tested in the cerebrum as well as in individual lobes and in the basal ganglia.

2.1 Data Availability

The data used in this work can be accessed by submitting a request to www.radc.rush.edu.

2.2 Participants

Older adults participating in four longitudinal, epidemiologic, clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), the Religious Orders Study (ROS) (Bennett et al., 2018), the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) (Barnes et al., 2012), and the Clinical Core of the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (Barnes et al., 2015) were included in this work. All four studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. Participants provided written informed consent and signed an anatomical gift act (AGA). All participants underwent annual uniform structured clinical evaluations, including cognitive function testing, medical history, and neurologic examination (Bennett et al., 2006). At the time of these analyses, 4808 participants of the parent projects had completed the baseline clinical evaluation. Of these, 619 died and 124 withdrew from the studies before the ex-vivo MRI sub-study began. Of the remaining 4065 persons, 2273 died, 1876 were autopsied, and 1004 had ex-vivo MRI and pathology data. Images of the first 320 participants to undergo ex-vivo MRI were reviewed, 31 participants were excluded because of large abnormalities (large hemorrhages, tumors, or large infarcts) or significant image artifacts, and the remaining 289 were included in this work. The other 684 persons with ex-vivo MRI and pathology data were not considered because CMB annotation was not completed by the time of this analysis.

2.3 Brain hemisphere preparation

After removal of the brain at autopsy, the cerebral hemisphere with the most visible pathology was chosen for ex-vivo MRI and pathologic examination, while the contralateral hemisphere was frozen and stored. Within 30 minutes of removal from the skull, the selected hemisphere was submerged in phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde solution and then refrigerated at 4°C. Before ex-vivo MRI, the hemisphere was placed in a container of 4% paraformaldehyde solution with the medial aspect facing the bottom of the container and allowed to return to room temperature (Arfanakis et al., 2020, Kotrotsou et al., 2015). A gross examination and a histopathologic diagnostic examination of the hemisphere were performed within 2 weeks of the ex-vivo MRI scan (Kotrotsou et al., 2015).

2.4 Ex-vivo MRI: data acquisition and preprocessing

Ex-vivo MRI data were collected approximately 30 days postmortem using a Philips 3 Tesla MRI scanner and a three dimensional multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) sequence with 10 echoes, TE1/ΔTE/TR = 4.6/4.63/49.5 ms, flip angle = 22 degrees, 65 sagittal slices, an acquired voxel-size of 1×1×1 mm3, and scan time = 8m 29s. Additional feature maps were generated from the raw images to aid the manual annotation of CMBs. More specifically, a T2* map was produced through a mono-exponential fit of the signal from the first four even echoes. In addition, modified Frangi filters (Frangi et al., 1998) were applied to the raw images to enhance small, round, hypointense features based on the magnitude and direction of the Hessian eigenvalues.

2.5 CMB annotation

CMBs were annotated on T2*-weighted ex-vivo MRI by an experienced rater blinded to all pathologic and clinical data. CMBs were defined as hypointense somewhat spherical structures fully surrounded by tissue which exhibit a `blooming effect` that causes them to look darker in later echoes. CMBs were required to have relatively low estimated T2* values with a small fitting error indicating that the signal decay across echoes was well modeled by the MR signal equation. CMBs were also required to have a relatively high value in both Frangi filter equations indicating that a voxel was a local hypointensity (Fig.1). CMB annotation using this approach was previously histologically validated in three participants from the present study (Nag et al., 2021). The number of CMBs in the cerebrum, as well as in different lobes and in the basal ganglia was counted for each participant (Fig.2). Segmentation of the different lobes and basal ganglia was completed using an in-house multi-atlas segmentation approach based on 30 atlases. The total number of CMBs per lobe and in the basal ganglia across all participants was normalized by the average volume of the corresponding region, or by the average volume of gray matter in that region, to generate measurements of CMB densities in different parts of the cerebrum. A map of CMB frequency across the cerebrum was also generated by mapping the locations of all CMBs in a common space and convolving this map with a three dimensional Gaussian function. In addition, the distance of each lobar CMB (excluding CMBs in the basal ganglia) from the nearest cortical gray/white matter junction was measured. CMBs in the cerebrum, in frontal, parietal, temporo-occipital lobes and the basal ganglia were considered in analyses. CMBs in the temporal and occipital lobes were combined for analysis due to the relatively few CMBs in either the temporal or occipital lobes alone.

2.6 Neuropathologic evaluation

A board-certified neuropathologist blinded to all imaging and clinical data performed detailed neuropathologic examination on each hemisphere after ex-vivo MRI. Hemispheres were first cut into 1cm thick coronal slabs and were macroscopically evaluated. Tissue blocks were selected, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 μm thickness and stained with Hematoxylin and eosin for microscopic evaluation. Gross infarcts of any age visible to the naked eye were rated as 0 (none), 1 (one), or 2 (more than one) (Schneider et al., 2003). Microscopic infarcts of any age were identified from a minimum of nine brain regions and were also rated as 0 (none), 1 (one), or 2 (more than one) (Arvanitakis et al., 2017). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was assessed in four regions (midfrontal, middle temporal, angular and calcarine cortices) and was scored as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) (Boyle et al., 2015). Arteriolosclerosis was evaluated in sections of the anterior basal ganglia and was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) (Arvanitakis et al., 2016). Atherosclerosis was evaluated at the circle of Willis and was rated as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe) (Arvanitakis et al., 2016). AD neuropathological change was ranked using the ABC score incorporating assessments of amyloid β deposits in 7 brain regions (midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, and cerebellar cortices, hippocampus, basal ganglia, substantia nigra) and described by a modified version of Thal phases (A score: 0, 1, 2, 3), staging of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (in hippocampus, entorhinal, midfrontal, inferior parietal, middle temporal cortices) modified from Braak and Braak (B score: 0, 1, 2, 3), and scoring of neuritic plaques (in midfrontal, inferior parietal, middle temporal cortices) modified from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) (C score: 0, 1, 2, 3) (Hyman et al., 2012). A pathologic diagnosis of AD was also made using the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria (Hyman et al., 2012). Lewy bodies were assessed in seven regions (substantia nigra, amygdala, entorhinal, anterior cingulate, midfrontal, superior or middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortices) and were rated as either present or absent (Agrawal et al., 2021). Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC) was graded into four stages: stage 0 (no TDP-43 inclusions); stage 1 (TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala only); stage 2 (TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala and entorhinal cortex or hippocampus); stage 3 (TDP-43 inclusions in amygdala, entorhinal cortex or hippocampus, and neocortex) (Nelson et al., 2019).

2.7 Statistical analysis

Pearson and Spearman correlations were used to assess relationships between neuropathologies as well as between neuropathologies and clinical variables. Spearman correlations were used to investigate relationships of CMB counts in the cerebrum or in individual lobes and the basal ganglia with clinical variables. Chi-squared tests were used to study the association of CMB counts with dementia diagnosis at death.

Poisson regression was used to investigate the association of the number of CMBs in the cerebrum (dependent variable) with each of the neuropathologies (i.e. the ordinal variables for gross and microscopic infarcts, the severity of CAA, arteriolosclerosis, and atherosclerosis, the A score, B score, C score, the presence of Lewy bodies, and LATE-NC stage), presence of at least one copy of the APOE ε4 allele, demographics (sex, years of education), and postmortem intervals to fixation (PMIf) and to imaging (PMIi), controlling for age at death. Next, all the variables that reached p&lt;0.10 in the first step were included together in a single Poisson regression model where the number of CMBs in the cerebrum was again the dependent variable. The same two-step process was repeated for the number of frontal, parietal, temporo-occipital, and basal ganglia CMBs as dependent variables. In the above, we examined severe overdispersion by evaluating the relation of the mean and variance of the dependent variable and by examining the model’s Pearson chi-square divided by its degrees of freedom (greater than 1.6). For dependent variables with overdispersion, the Poisson models also included a Pearson-based estimated scale parameter to adjust for the overdispersion. After applying Bonferroni correction to control for testing five Poisson regression models (i.e. one for the number of CMBs in the cerebrum and one for the number of CMBs in each lobe and basal ganglia), associations were considered significant at p&lt;0.01.

3. Results

3.1 Demographic, clinical, neuropathologic and CMB characteristics

The 289 participants included in this study had a mean age at death of 90.3 years (SD=6.2 years) and 55% were without dementia (Table 1). Neuropathologic characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 2. A total of 492 CMBs were identified in 193 (67%) of the 289 participants (Fig.3). Only 5% of the participants had more than 5 CMBs. Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants with at least one CMB did not differ in participants with no CMBs (Table 1). Correlations between neuropathologies as well as between neuropathologies and clinical characteristics were low (the highest Spearman correlation was 0.34 and was observed between gross and microscopic infarcts). Out of the total of 492 CMBs, 39% were located in the frontal lobe, 30% in the parietal lobe, 12% in the temporal lobe, 7% in the occipital lobe, and 12% in the basal ganglia. After normalizing the number of CMBs per lobe and in the basal ganglia with the average volume of the corresponding region, or with the average volume of gray matter in that region, the resulting densities of CMBs in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe and basal ganglia were similar to each other (less than 7% different when normalizing with the average volume of the corresponding region) and about 50% higher than the CMB density in the temporal and occipital lobes (Table 3). A more detailed map of CMB frequency across the cerebrum is shown in Figure 4 and demonstrates the lower density of CMBs especially in the temporal lobe. Furthermore, the majority of lobar CMBs were located near the cortical gray/white matter junction as shown in the histogram of Figure 5. More specifically, among the frontal, parietal and temporo-occipital CMBs, 70% were located in white matter within 2mm of the cortical gray/white matter junction, and 16% were located within cortical gray matter.

Finally, higher numbers of CMBs in the cerebrum or in individual lobes and the basal ganglia were not associated with dementia (χ2 test).

3.2 Association of CMBs with age-related neuropathologies

Poisson regression combining neuropathologic, demographic and other factors as independent variables in the same model showed that the number of CMBs in the cerebrum was higher with more severe CAA (β=0.263, SE=0.092, p=0.004) (Table 4). In the frontal lobe, the number of CMBs was higher with more severe CAA (β=0.394, SE=0.121, p=0.001) and more severe arteriolosclerosis (β=0.377, SE=0.118, p=0.001). In the basal ganglia, the number of CMBs was nearly significantly associated with microinfarcts (β=0.432, SE=0.176, p=0.014). No significant associations of CMBs with neuropathologies were observed in the parietal lobe and the combined temporal and occipital lobes. Furthermore, no significant associations of CMBs with demographics and postmortem intervals to fixation and to imaging were observed in the cerebrum or individual lobes and basal ganglia. In supporting analyses that also considered clinical variables (history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, smoking, systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in addition to neuropathologies in the Poisson regression, the main findings described above did not change.

4. Discussion

This study examined the neuropathologic correlates of CMBs in the cerebrum as a whole as well as in individual lobes and in the basal ganglia by combining ex-vivo MRI and detailed neuropathologic examination in a large number of community-based older adults. CMBs were common, they were typically present in small numbers per person, had a lower density in the temporal and occipital lobes compared to other areas of the cerebrum where the density was relatively similar, and the majority of lobar CMBs were adjacent to the cortical gray/white matter junction or within the cortex. CMBs in the cerebrum overall and specifically in the frontal lobe were found to be associated with CAA, CMBs in the frontal lobe were also associated with arteriolosclerosis, and CMBs in the basal ganglia were nearly significantly associated with microinfarcts. No associations were found between CMBs and neurodegenerative pathologies. These findings suggest that CMBs can aid in the prediction of small vessel disease in community-based older adults. In addition, CMBs were not associated with dementia, suggesting that in community-based older adults, CMBs may not be linked to substantial cognitive impairment.

First, the prevalence of CMBs was higher than that reported in most community studies (Puy et al., 2021). This was partly due to the higher mean age of our participants and the fact that CMBs are more common in advanced age (Vinke et al., 2018), and partly due to the enhanced CMB detectability in the present work provided by the higher magnetic field strength compared to previous works and due to imaging ex-vivo. Yet, substantially higher CMB prevalence has been reported in a previous autopsy series in a group of older adults that actually exhibited lower rates of dementia, vascular and neurodegenerative pathologies (Kövari et al., 2015). In agreement with published studies in community cohorts, CMBs were present mostly in small numbers per participant, and were mostly lobar (Romero et al., 2017; Sveinbjornsdottir et al., 2008; Poels et al., 2010; Akoudad et al., 2015). When considering the number of CMBs per unit volume of brain tissue (CMB density) the frontal and parietal lobes and basal ganglia exhibited similar CMB density, with the parietal lobe showing the highest density in agreement with previous reports (Sveinbjornsdottir et al., 2008; Kövari et al., 2015). The temporal and occipital lobes exhibited lower CMB density (Sveinbjornsdottir et al., 2008; Kövari et al., 2015), with the temporal lobe showing the lowest density, which was also evident in the CMB frequency map. In contrast, an early report from the Rotterdam Scan Study (Mesker et al., 2011) showed the highest CMB density in the temporal lobe followed by the parietal lobe, which may be due to differences in the characteristics across cohorts and in the methodology used for microbleed detection, or due to imaging in-vivo vs. ex-vivo, imaging at different magnetic field strengths, and relatively small sample sizes. The majority of lobar CMBs found in the present work were adjacent to the cortical gray/white matter junction or located inside the cortex. A similar distribution has been reported in numerous other studies in patients with CAA (van Veluw et al., 2016) or AD (De Reuck et al., 2013). In an earlier report in a community cohort, only a small portion of the CMBs was located in cortical gray matter or on the gray-white matter border (Sveinbjornsdottir et al., 2008), but the definition of what is adjacent to the cortical boundary may have been different.

CMBs in the cerebrum were independently associated with CAA controlling for other neuropathologies as well as demographic and other factors. This relationship was mainly driven by the frontal lobe which included 39% of all CMBs detected in the present work. Interestingly, the majority of CMBs in the frontal lobe were located within 2mm of the cortical gray/white matter junction or within the cortex, and CAA is known to affect arterioles mainly located in the leptomeninges and cerebral cortex (Charidimou et al., 2017). Multiple studies in clinical settings have also demonstrated a link between strictly lobar CMBs and CAA pathology or high amyloid burden measured with PET (Boyano et al., 2018; Guidoux et al., 2018; Schrag et al., 2010, Park et al., 2013). Although the distribution of CAA generally peaks in posterior brain regions (Charidimou et al., 2017), in the present work only CMBs in the frontal lobe were associated with CAA. The lack of an association in posterior brain regions may be due to the low number of CMBs there. Also, a recent study showed no topographical association between CMBs and presence of CAA (Kövari et al., 2015). Further work is needed to determine the mechanism underlying the link between frontal lobe CMBs and CAA.

CMBs in the frontal lobe were also independently associated with arteriolosclerosis controlling for other neuropathologies as well as demographic and other factors. Arteriolosclerosis may weaken arteriolar walls increasing the likelihood of a rupture and the formation of CMBs, and recent work showed that moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis is more prevalent in the frontal lobe of community-dwelling older adults (Oveisgharan et al., 2023). The present study demonstrated that, in community-based older adults, both CAA and arteriolosclerosis are linked to frontal lobe CMBs, while previous work in mostly small clinical cohorts suggested that CAA is key contributor of CMBs in or near the cortex while hypertensive angiopathy is linked to CMBs located in subcortical brain tissue (Charidimou et al., 2017). Supporting evidence of the presence of more than one contributor to lobar CMBs in community-based older adults was demonstrated in previous work that showed that although strictly lobar CMBs predicted moderate/severe CAA in patients, the link between strictly lobar CMBs and CAA was limited when studying community-based participants (Martinez-Ramirez et al., 2015). The presence of additional, non-CAA mechanisms leading to lobar CMBs is likely the reason why lobar CMBs alone are not sufficient in predicting CAA pathology, which is clearly depicted in the Boston criteria v2.0 for CAA (Charidimou et al., 2022). Further support that both CAA and arteriolosclerosis are linked to lobar CMBs can be found in a study in a clinical cohort that although did not include pathology data, it combined MRI and PET and concluded that both amyloid-related pathologies (assessed by means of amyloid PET) and small vessel disease (defined as white matter hyperintensities and lacunar infarcts) contribute to lobar CMBs (Park et al., 2013). The present work provides a direct demonstration that CMBs in the frontal lobe are independently associated with both CAA and arteriolosclerosis in community-based older adults.

CMBs in the basal ganglia were independently associated with microinfarcts controlling for other neuropathologies as well as demographic and other factors, however the p-value for this association was 0.014 which was just over the Bonferroni-corrected alpha value of 0.01. Previous reports from a large community-based cohort study showed that CMBs in deep brain tissue are associated with lacunar infarcts seen on MRI (Poels et al., 2010) and with an increased risk of stroke (Akoudad et al., 2015). Recent work in a limited number of patients with neuropathologic evidence of CAA also showed an association between CMBs and microinfarcts, but did not clarify the location of CMBs (Lauer et al., 2016). Deep brain areas are susceptible to ischemic tissue injury. Our result suggests that a potential mechanism leading to MRI-defined CMBs in the basal ganglia of community-based older adults may be hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic tissue injury (van Veluw et al., 2022).

CMBs were not associated with dementia in agreement with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis (Bos et al., 2018). This suggests that the relatively low number of CMBs in community-based older adults is not sufficient to cause substantial cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, community studies have previously reported associations of CMBs with lower performance in different cognitive domains, especially for high numbers of CMBs (Yates et al., 2014).

The current study has several important strengths and a few weaknesses. The strengths include: studying a large number of community-based older adults, considering multiple neuropathologies in the same models of CMBs, and imaging ex-vivo which reduces the bias towards those with lower frailty and also ensures that MRI and neuropathologic examination capture the same brain condition. One weakness of the present study was that only one cerebral hemisphere was available for each participant and therefore laterality was not studied. Nevertheless, the percentage of right hemispheres from participants with at least one CMB was exactly the same as that in participants with no CMBs. Another weakness was that CMBs were annotated by a single experienced rater. We and others are actively working towards the development of a method for automated segmentation of CMBs but a reliable solution is not yet available. Furthermore, the CMBs identified in this work were not histologically examined in a routine fashion and a portion of them may have been acute or subacute (Nag et al., 2021), which may have partly contributed to the lack of an association between CMBs and dementia.

5. Conclusion

The present work examined the neuropathologic correlates of CMBs in the cerebrum as a whole as well as in individual lobes and in the basal ganglia by combining ex-vivo MRI and detailed neuropathologic examination in a large number of community-based older adults. CMBs in the cerebrum overall and specifically in the frontal lobe were associated with CAA, CMBs in the frontal lobe were also associated with arteriolosclerosis, and CMBs in the basal ganglia were nearly significantly associated with microinfarcts. CMBs in any part of the cerebrum were not associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. These findings suggest that CMBs can aid in the prediction of small vessel disease in community-based older adults. Finally, CMBs were not associated with dementia, suggesting that in community-based older adults, CMBs may not be linked to substantial cognitive impairment.

(D) The adjacent section shows strong Prussian blue staining of the hemosiderin collections by the Perl’s stain. C, D scale bar = 100μm.

Figure 4. Colormap of the frequency of CMBs in the cerebrum for the present study. It was constructed by mapping the locations of all CMBs in a common space (an ex-vivo MRI template of cerebral hemispheres constructed in-house) and convolving the resulting map with a three dimensional Gaussian function.

Figure 5. Distribution of lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) according to their distance from the cortical gray/white matter junction. Negative distances represent locations inside the cortex and positive distances represent locations in white matter.
