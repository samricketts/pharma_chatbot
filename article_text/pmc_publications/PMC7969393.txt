BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:

Given the lack of effective pharmacologic strategies to prevent, slow, or reverse dementia progression, maximizing quality of life (QOL) is a major priority for persons living with dementia. Despite well-documented racial/ethnic disparities in dementia incidence and prevalence, it is unknown whether there are racial/ethnic disparities in QOL among persons with dementia. The objective of this study was to determine if there are racial/ethnic differences in poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among persons with and without dementia in a nationally-representative cohort.

DESIGN:

Repeated measures cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study.

SETTING:

United States nationally-representative National Health and Aging Trends Study (2011–2018).

PARTICIPANTS:

Non-nursing home-dwelling Black, Latino, and white adults age 65+ (n = 10,886).

MEASUREMENTS:

We estimated racial/ethnic differences in five dichotomous indicators of poor HRQOL (depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-rated health, pain, and physical functional limitations), stratified by dementia status (probable, possible, none). We used generalized estimating equations to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and differences, and marginal standardization to estimate prevalence.

RESULTS:

Generally, Blacks and Latinos reported higher prevalence of poor HRQOL compared with whites. The largest differences were observed for self-rated health, and Latino-white differences were slightly larger compared to Black-white differences. PRs were larger among those with no dementia. For example, the Black versus white PRs for poor self-rated health were 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.82–2.04) among the no dementia group and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.12–1.31) among the probable dementia group; Latino versus white PRs for these comparisons were 2.39(2.21–2.59) and 1.48 (1.35–1.62), respectively. Prevalence differences also showed racial/ethnic differences, but these were similar across dementia statuses.

CONCLUSIONS:

We observed racial/ethnic disparities in poor HRQOL, showing greater unmet clinical needs among Black and Latino versus white older adults. Relative disparities were smaller in those with dementia, but absolute magnitudes of disparities were similar by dementia status.

INTRODUCTION

Given the lack of effective pharmacologic strategies to prevent, slow, or reverse progression of dementia, maximizing quality of life (QOL) is a major priority for the more than 5 million Americans living with dementia and their caregivers.1,2 Quality of life is a broad construct, often including four major dimensions of psychological well-being, behavioral competence, environment quality, and perceived QOL.3 In people living with dementia, these dimensions are frequently measured by assessing aspects of mood, life satisfaction, feelings of self-worth, and daily activities.3,4 As health status is an important driver of QOL in people with dementia,5,6 some dementia-specific measures use health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as a proxy for QOL more broadly,7 with mood and functional ability/activities being particularly important elements.5,6,8

Persons with dementia tend to report lower QOL compared to those without dementia (e.g., due to social isolation and/or need for help with activities of daily living).6,9,10 Declines in QOL may begin before diagnostic criteria for dementia are met (i.e., among those with mild cognitive impairment).11 Early cognitive decline may represent a period of particular vulnerability, as insight regarding cognition changes can be distressing.11,12

To date, most research on QOL and dementia/cognitive impairment has occurred in clinic-based, nursing home-dwelling, or trial-based samples, which tend to be predominantly white and highly educated.7,13 As a result, despite well-documented racial/ethnic disparities in dementia incidence and prevalence,14,15 little is known about racial/ethnic differences in QOL among persons living with dementia or cognitive impairment. Many physical and psychosocial factors that affect QOL are also risk factors for dementia and are patterned by race/ethnicity. Thus, evaluating racial/ethnic differences in HRQOL among persons without dementia or cognitive impairment can help contextualize patterns in HRQOL among persons with dementia or cognitive impairment across racial/ethnic groups. Such quantitative characterization is an important step in pursuing greater equity in aging; focusing on indicators of poor HRQOL, we aimed to provide the first assessment of potential racial/ethnic differences among persons living with probable, possible, or no dementia in a nationally-representative sample. Because conclusions about disparities can depend on the measure of association used,16 we assessed both relative and absolute measures.

METHODS

Data and Participants

Data were obtained from the U.S. National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a longitudinal study of a nationally-representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, designed to study late-life functioning.17 The initial sample was enrolled in 2011, and a replenishment sample was enrolled in 2015 (Wave 5) to maintain national representation. Annual in-person interviews are conducted for all participants. Interviews were conducted with proxy respondents for participants unable to complete the interview; interviewers sought proxies who lived with the participants and were familiar with their routines.17

For this analysis, we pooled data from Waves 1 to 8 (2011–2018). Because only facility-level data were available for most nursing home residents, we restricted our sample to NHATS participants not residing in nursing homes at each wave. To report racial/ethnic differences in poor HRQOL, we also restricted to participants who were Black, Latino, or white (the three largest racial/ethnic groups represented in the study, comprising 94.7% of participants). Finally, we restricted the analytic sample to the 98.3% of remaining observations with complete data on the variables used in the primary analysis (HRQOL outcomes, age, and sex/gender).

NHATS data are publicly available and de-identified, and their use is not considered human subjects research. An exemption from review was obtained from the UCLA Institutional Review Board (#20–000092).

Health-Related Quality of Life

Outcomes of interest comprised five dichotomous indicators of poor HRQOL previously developed by Schwartz et al for their consistency with sub-domains of the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey, which has been compared in individuals with dementia and their proxies.18,19 These indicators are also consistent with an emphasis on mood and functional limitations in people with dementia.5,6 Questions were asked of participants or their proxies. Elevated depressive symptoms were defined by a score of 3 or more (range 0–6) on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 depression screener.20 Elevated anxiety symptoms were defined by a score of 3 or more (range 0–6) on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 screener.21 Participants or their proxies also rated participants’ overall health (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor); “low overall health” was defined as fair/poor. Participants or their proxies were asked whether the participant had been bothered by pain in the last month (yes/no). Functional limitations related to basic physical activities of daily living (i.e., ADL disabilities22) were defined as the participant needing help with any of: eating, getting cleaned up, using the toilet, dressing, walking around inside, and getting out of bed.

Race/Ethnicity

We conceptualized race/ethnicity as a social construct and utilized the NHATS-derived variable for self-reported race/ethnicity. Participants who reported Latino ethnicity (regardless of race), were recorded as Latino. Participants who reported identifying as only or primarily Black, white, or another race/ethnicity (e.g., American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander), were classified as Black, white, and “other” accordingly. Participants who did not report any primary race or ethnicity were recorded as missing. Due to small sample size of the missing and “other” groups, we restricted analyses to Black, Latino, and white participants (94.7% of sample).

Classification of Dementia Status

In primary analyses, dementia status was determined using the algorithm developed by NHATS.23 Participants were classified as having probable dementia if they had self- or proxy-reported dementia diagnosis, scored 2 or more on the AD-8 proxy instrument,24 or scored at least 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the Wave 1 whole sample mean on two or more cognitive test domains: memory (immediate and delayed 10-word recall); orientation (month, year, and day of the week, naming of President and Vice President); and executive function (clock drawing test). Participants who did not meet criteria for probable dementia but scored at least 1.5 SDs below the mean on one or more cognitive test domains were classified as possible dementia, and all others were classified as not having dementia. Combining probable and possible dementia, this algorithm was reported to have overall sensitivity of 71.8% and specificity of 83.7% for dementia and non-dementia cognitive impairment in the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, a subsample of another nationally-representative cohort employing gold standard diagnostic assessment.23

Other Variables

Other covariates included age, available only categorically (65–69, 70–74, 75–79, 80–84, 85–89, 90+), and sex/gender (female/male). To describe the sample, we also examined place of birth (United States or other), educational attainment (no school completed, 1st–8th grade, 9th–12th grade, high school diploma or equivalent, some college but no degree, associate’s degree or certificate /diploma beyond high school, bachelor’s degree or higher), U.S. Census region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, West), residence type (residential care or community), and self- or proxy-reported dichotomous history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke. We also examined financial hardship, a measure of insufficient financial resources to meet basic needs.25 Consistent with prior work in NHATS,25,26 we defined financial hardship as being unable to pay for any of: rent/mortgage, utility bills, or medical care in the last year, or food in the last month; these items were not asked in Wave 1, so we used Wave 2 responses for participants enrolled in Wave 1. For proxy respondents, we characterized relationships to participants, categorized as spouse, child (own, step, or in-law), other relative (e.g., niece/nephew, grandchild), and nonrelative (e.g., friend, aide) and level of proxy familiarity with participant’s routine.

Statistical Methodology

To assess potential differences by race/ethnicity in dichotomous indicators of poor HRQOL (Black vs white and Latino vs white), we used generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors stratified by dementia classification and adjusted for age and sex/gender. Conclusions about the presence of health disparities may differ depending on whether measures of association are relative or absolute differences in the outcome.16 To obtain a complete picture of potential differences by race/ethnicity in HRQOL across dementia classifications, we examined both prevalence ratios (PRs) and prevalence differences.

We estimated separate models for each indicator of poor HRQOL, and to account for repeated measures of the outcomes across waves, all models included clustering by participant with an exchangeable correlation structure. The generalized estimating equations used a Poisson distribution with log link for PR models and identity link for prevalence difference models, as some models did not converge using a binomial outcome distribution.27 To obtain nationally-representative estimates of differences in poor HRQOL, we applied NHATS sampling weights (additional details in sensitivity analyses section below).

A complete examination of health disparities includes assessment of prevalence of the outcome in addition to effect estimates.28 We used PR models to estimate predicted prevalence of each poor HRQOL outcome by race/ethnicity and dementia classification, standardized to the marginal age and sex/gender distribution of the weighted sample within each dementia classification.

All analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.1 and geepack and emmeans packages.29,30

Sensitivity Analyses

NHATS sampling weights for each wave weight up to the nationally-representative population eligible for NHATS in the year prior to data collection.17 This study included data from the eight currently available waves of NHATS, and as such, there was no single population for which it was most appropriate to apply weights. Our main analysis used the first observed weight for each participant (Wave 1 weight for the original cohort and Wave 5 weight for the refreshment sample). We also conducted sensitivity analyses with alternative weighting strategies, conducting the same analysis: a) in the unweighted sample and b) applying each participant’s average sampling weight.

Accuracy of algorithmic dementia ascertainment can be differential by race/ethnicity,31 and the NHATS dementia classification algorithm does not include differential cognitive test score thresholds by race/ethnicity.23 We evaluated sensitivity of our results to possible differential dementia ascertainment accuracy by examining race/ethnicity-specific thresholds. We calculated race/ethnicity-specific means and SDs for cognitive test domains in the full sample and modified the NHATS dementia classification by using race/ethnicity-specific thresholds for cognitive domains rather than thresholds based on the overall sample: we categorized participants who scored at least 1.5 SDs below the race/ethnicity-specific mean on two or more domains as having probable dementia, and participants who scored at least 1.5 SDs below the race/ethnicity-specific mean for one cognitive domain as having possible dementia (additional details in Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S1).

Finally, proxy respondents may have difficulty appraising some indicators of poor HRQOL, potentially introducing measurement error. To account for this, we compared characteristics for observations with and without proxy respondents and conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to observations (n = 41,344) without proxy respondents.

RESULTS

Our sample included 10,886 individuals; after applying sample weights, 83.9% were white, 8.6% were Black, and 7.5% were Latino (Table 1). The distribution of age at enrollment was similar across racial/ethnic groups. Just over half of the sample was female. The vast majority of whites and Blacks (&gt;90%) were US-born, but only one-third of Latinos were US-born. Levels of educational attainment tended to be highest among whites, followed by Blacks and Latinos (e.g., 29% with bachelor’s degree or higher vs 15% and 9%, respectively), and a larger proportion of Latinos had no formal education (6%) compared with Blacks and whites (both &lt;1%). Financial hardship was more common among Black and Latino participants (16.6% and 13.3%, respectively, vs 5.2% in whites). Blacks and Latinos were more likely than whites to reside in the South. Prevalence of self-reported high blood pressure and diabetes at enrollment were higher among Blacks and Latinos, and history of stroke was most common among Blacks. At enrollment, the prevalences of probable and possible dementia were higher among Blacks and Latinos than whites. Unweighted sample characteristics provided in Supplementary Table S2.

The sample included 43,764 observations for the 10,886 participants; mean (SD) number of observations per participant was 4.1 (2.5) for whites, 3.9 (2.5) for Blacks, and 3.7 (2.4) for Latinos. Among observations of participants classified as having probable dementia, approximately 40% of respondents were proxies (37% for whites, 41% for Blacks, and 42% for Latinos). Across all racial/ethnic groups, proxies comprised less than 3.5% of observations with possible dementia and less than 2.5% of observations without dementia. At enrollment, proxies for white and Latino participants were most commonly children (46.3% and 66.5%, respectively) and spouses (37.6% and 21.1%, respectively), whereas Black participants’ proxies were most commonly children (59.1%) or other relatives (17.5%) (Table 1). Over 90% of proxies in all racial/ethnic groups reported being “very familiar” with the participant’s routines.

Figure 1 shows PRs for racial/ethnic differences for each poor HRQOL outcome, adjusted for age and sex/gender, and stratified by dementia classification. For all outcomes except pain, PRs were largest among those without dementia and smallest (null or closest to null) among those with probable dementia. The greatest racial/ethnic PRs were observed for self-rated health. For example, among persons without dementia, Blacks had 1.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.82–2.04) times the prevalence of fair/poor self-rated health compared to whites. Among those with possible and probable dementia, prevalence of fair/poor self-rated health was 1.51 (95% CI = 1.36–1.68) and 1.21 (95% CI = 1.12–1.31) times higher among Blacks versus whites, respectively. PRs for Latinos versus whites were slightly larger than those for Blacks versus whites; Latino versus white PRs (95% CI) were 2.39 (2.21–2.59),1.67 (1.47–1.91), and 1.48 (1.35–1.62) among those with no, possible and probable dementia, respectively. PRs for pain were close to one (null) for all dementia groups. Tabular results provided in Supplementary Table S3.

Figure 2 shows prevalence differences for racial/ethnic differences for each poor HRQOL outcome. The gradient in magnitude of racial/ethnic differences across dementia classification groups was smaller for prevalence differences than for PRs. Prevalence differences were also larger for self-rated health than for other outcomes and larger for Latinos versus whites than Blacks versus whites. For example, prevalence of fair/poor health was 19% to 22% higher among Latinos versus whites across all dementia classifications, whereas prevalence differences for fair/poor self-rated health among Blacks versus whites ranged from 9% to 15% across dementia classifications. Few differences were observed between Blacks and whites in elevated anxiety symptoms, pain, and physical function limitations. Tabular results provided in Supplementary Table S3.

Figure 3 shows marginal age and sex-standardized predicted prevalences of poor HRQOL outcomes from the PR regression models. Pain was the most prevalent outcome, reported by approximately half to two-thirds of all race/ethnicity and dementia classification groups. Prevalence of the other outcomes was lowest in those without dementia and increased among the possible and probable dementia groups. For example, prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms was 15% (95% CI = 14–16%), 21% (95% CI = 19–24%), and 31% (95% CI = 28–34%) among Blacks with no, possible, and probable dementia, respectively. Tabular results provided in Supplementary Table S4.

Sensitivity analyses using two alternative weighting approaches (unweighted and applying each participant’s average weight across waves) and using race/ethnicity-specific thresholds to classify dementia from cognitive tests yielded similar results (Supplementary Figures S2–S4 and Supplementary Tables S5–S7). When restricting to observations without proxy respondents, trends in PRs and differences were qualitatively similar, but predicted prevalences of indicators of poor HRQOL were lower than the main analysis (Supplementary Figure S5 and Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). Compared to those without a proxy respondent, observations for individuals using proxies were older, and more commonly lived in residential care settings and had a history of stroke (Supplementary Table S10).

DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in poor HRQOL among persons with and without dementia using a nationally-representative sample. Although a few prior studies have reported poorer QOL among non-white versus white older adults with dementia,10,32,33 to our knowledge this is the first study to specifically assess racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL and their relationship with dementia, which is critical for understanding and assessing progress in health equity in older adults. The results showed that in general (and independent of dementia status), Blacks and Latinos reported higher prevalence of indicators of poor HRQOL than whites.

Our results demonstrate the importance of considering outcome prevalence and scale in assessing racial/ethnic health disparities.16,28 Across dementia statuses (none, possible, probable), we observed decreasing PRs (Black vs white and Latino vs white) but similar prevalence differences. We also observed increasing predicted prevalence of poor HRQOL moving from no dementia to probable dementia; as the possible dementia group may represent individuals with mild cognitive impairment, our results are consistent with literature showing worsening QOL in the setting of cognitive decline.6,9–11 These results suggest that the narrower racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL on the relative scale among those with possible and probable dementia are driven by higher prevalence of indicators of poor HRQOL among persons with possible and probable dementia, rather than decreasing absolute disparities. Indeed, prevalence difference analyses show that absolute elevation in proportion of Blacks and Latinos reporting poor HRQOL did not decrease among those with possible or probable dementia compared to those without. Prior to this study, it was unknown whether disparities on either scale would increase, remain constant, or decrease as level of cognitive impairment worsened.

There are several possible explanations for the disparities in poor HRQOL we observed across the spectrum of cognitive impairment. Consistent with critical race theory,34 we posit that racial/ethnic disparities are the result of social processes such as racism and other forms of oppression, rather than biological differences.34–36 Indicators of poor HRQOL may be proxies for physical and psychosocial factors that are also risk factors for dementia (e.g., chronic disease burden, life satisfaction, social engagement).3,4,37 Many of these risk factors are influenced by social and environmental factors that disproportionately impact certain racial/ethnic groups. Second, factors known to vary by race/ethnicity in dementia, such as subjective appraisal of cognitive decline, coping strategies, and living settings,6,10,13 are also likely to impact QOL.6,9,10 Some outcomes, such as reporting being bothered by pain, may be subject to cultural differences in perceived acceptability or inevitability. Finally, potential disparities in financial resources (in our study, financial hardship was more common among Black and Latino participants than white participants) and other factors related to diagnosis and access to care may contribute to HRQOL disparities among those with dementia, as Black and Latino individuals tend to be diagnosed at more advanced disease stages and report more unmet care needs.38–40

In addition to the small sample size that precluded examination of additional racial/ethnic groups, the primary limitations of this study relate to measurement challenges. NHATS does not include gold-standard ascertainment of dementia and the algorithm relies on a limited battery of cognitive tests. Although this algorithm does not rely solely on clinical diagnosis, which may occur at more severe stages of disease among Black and Latino individuals as discussed above, similar algorithms in other cohorts have nonetheless shown differential accuracy by race/ethnicity,31 potentially including in the “dementia” group a larger proportion of persons with less severe cognitive impairment among Blacks and Latinos than whites. We addressed this limitation with sensitivity analyses using race-specific thresholds for dementia classification from cognitive tests; these analyses yielded similar results. Additionally, because our data came from a nationally-representative study, the indicators of poor HRQOL were not developed specifically for use in dementia, which may reduce comparability between the dementia and non-dementia groups. The indicators are consistent with an emphasis on mood and functional limitations in people with dementia,5,6 but do not capture all aspects of HRQOL (e.g., perceived impact of health status on life, social interactions, self-esteem).8

Use of proxy respondents represented the only way of obtaining nationally-representative estimates of HRQOL disparities among people with dementia. Use of proxies can introduce error41 as proxy respondents may have difficulty appraising some indicators of poor HRQOL, particularly mental health and pain, and tend to rate HRQOL lower than participants.42 However, literature shows that proxy respondents can be useful in severe dementia, including for HRQOL.1,19 Our sensitivity analysis excluding proxy observations yielded somewhat lower prevalences of poor HRQOL across race/ethnicity. Although this may reflect some proxy reporting bias, it could also be due to the fact that participants with probable dementia who used proxies were older and had more comorbidities; thus, these individuals may also have truly lower HRQOL than participants not using proxies. Additionally, use of proxy respondents did not differ meaningfully by race/ethnicity, and although the relationships of proxies to participants varied by race/ethnicity, estimates of disparities were similar in the sensitivity analysis excluding proxy respondents, suggesting errors in proxy reporting were not differential by race/ethnicity.

In conclusion, our work represents the first estimates of disparities in HRQOL among a nationally-representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries not living in nursing homes, including individuals with and without dementia. Prevalence of many indicators of poor HRQOL was higher among Black and Latino versus white older adults. Relative to the prevalence of poor HRQOL in whites, the proportional increase in Black and Latino groups is smaller in the presence of possible or probable dementia, but in absolute terms, the magnitude of disparities is the same across dementia statuses. Important areas of future inquiry include understanding the sources of and mechanisms explaining drivers of HRQOL (e.g., prescribing practices for high observed burden of pain) and HRQOL disparities (e.g., contributions of social contact, financial resources/hardship, access to care), as well as evaluating potential heterogeneity within racial/ethnic groups. Finally, understanding how HRQOL drivers and disparities might change as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected people of color and caused many older adults to become more isolated, will also be critical to understanding HRQOL and improving equity in aging across the spectrum of cognitive decline.
