Untreated pain in people with Alzheimer’s disease continues to be a serious public health problem. Pain is a subjective and complex experience that becomes increasingly challenging to assess as cognition declines. Our understanding of pain processing is incomplete, particularly for special populations such as people living with Alzheimer’s disease, and especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Pain-processing networks in the brain are altered in Alzheimer’s disease, yet evidence suggests people living with Alzheimer’s disease do not experience less pain. Rather, their pain is not adequately recognized or treated. Although scholarly publications provide important assistance, recent widespread reports and guidelines do not include sufficient guidance, especially as Alzheimer’s disease progresses to the last stages. Additionally, current pain measurements may not accurately evaluate pain in this condition, and the existing definitions of pain are not adequate when considering the effects of Alzheimer’s disease on pain-processing in the brain. There is a need for new, widespread policies, guidelines, and definitions to help clinicians adequately manage pain in people with Alzheimer’s disease. These will need to hinge on continued research because it remains unclear how Alzheimer’s disease impacts central pain processing, pain expression, and communication of pain. In the meantime, policies and guidelines need to highlight current best practices as well as the fact that pain continues in Alzheimer’s disease.


Section 4305 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act directed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to develop a blueprint for changing the way pain is understood, assessed, treated, and—-where possible—prevented. In the report, released in 2011, IOM concluded that current pain treatment is inadequate and shortcomings in clinician knowledge are a major contributing factor (IOM, 2011). Among the shortcomings in knowledge is a lack of in-depth understanding of how pain is processed in the brain. Substantial advancements have been made in brain research since the IOM report, but understanding pain processing is still incomplete, particularly for special populations such as people living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), especially those in the advanced stages of the disease.

Assessment and treatment of pain is challenging in people without cognitive impairments (IOM, 2011), and this becomes profoundly more complex in people with cognitive impairments such as AD (Defrin et al., 2015; Monroe &amp; Mion, 2012). One reason may be that pain-processing networks in the brain are altered in AD, yet evidence suggests people with AD do not experience less pain (Corbett et al., 2012; Cravello et al., 2019; Monroe et al., 2012a). This paper focuses on AD; however, the terms AD and dementia are often used interchangeably, and pain and undertreatment of pain may continue in less prevalent dementia subtypes as well (Binnekade et al., 2018; Cravello et al., 2019).

The most recent Health and Human Services (HHS) Pain Management Best Practices Report recognizes that chronic pain is a serious, debilitating, and common problem in older adults that results in a great economic burden and requires specialized clinical knowledge (HHS, 2019). Despite this, there is a lack of guidance or mention of pain in AD or related dementias in the HHS report. Outside of references to palliative and hospice care, assessing and treating pain in AD and related dementias is also absent in the most recent Alzheimer’s Association (2020) and Alzheimer Disease International (2019) major annual reports. While palliative and hospice care are beneficial in care management, palliative care is underused, and those with a prognosis of longer than 6 months do not yet qualify for hospice care (Boucher et al., 2018). Additionally, another study found that out of their sample, 100% of people with very severe cognitive impairment and cancer were not enrolled in hospice (Monroe et al., 2013). There is therefore a need for more research to develop evidence-based guidelines that can then inform new, widespread policies and guidelines to help clinicians adequately manage pain in people with AD. Until better evidence is available, existing recommendations need to be emphasized, better disseminated, and put into practice.

Pain Assessment and Management in Alzheimer Disease

The pain experience is a combination of sensory information, past experiences, contextual/environmental factors, emotions/mood, attention, and expectations (Coghill, 2010; IOM, 2011; Tracey &amp; Mantyh, 2007). Yet, for people with cognitive decline, these memory-based processes are likely altered. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as an “unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage” (IASP, 2018, para. 1), while the American Nurses Association (ANA) affirms McCaffery’s definition by describing pain as “whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever he says it does” (ANA, 2018, para. 2). In general, the American Society for Pain Management Nursing (ASPMN) supports this ANA position (ASPMN, 2020). These definitions appear to be built on the assumption that individuals experiencing pain have the capacity at some level to communicate their pain. This is not always the case, as self-report is often ineffective for noncommunicative individuals and those unable to understand a pain scale because of memory loss or cognitive impairment (Cravello et al., 2019; Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2014; Monroe &amp; Mion, 2012; Rababa, 2018b). The ASPMN acknowledges this issue, as demonstrated in one of their recent position statements (Herr et al., 2019).

The ability of an individual with AD to comprehend a scale such as the widely used visual analogue scale (VAS) declines substantially as AD worsens (Defrin et al., 2015). For people unable to communicate or adequately report their pain, observational pain scales such as the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Scale (PAINAD; Herr et al., 2010; Warden et al., 2003) and the new Pain Assessment in Impaired Cognition Scale (PAIC15; Kunz et al., 2020b) are recommended. The PAIC15 was developed to help consolidate the most useful pain behaviors into one tool (Kunz et al., 2020b) and includes more detailed and specific facial expressions of pain, which are thought to be more reliable for pain detection (Lautenbacher &amp; Kunz, 2017; Lautenbacher et al., 2018).

If a pain behavior is absent, such as in the presence of pathological disorders or adverse drug effects (Monroe et al., 2012a; Paulson et al., 2014), or unnoticed (Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Creedon, 2002) at the time of observation, observational scales may be ineffective (Monroe &amp; Mion, 2012). Despite multiple studies, there is still controversy about which behaviors truly indicate pain rather than another unmet need (Rababa, 2018a, 2018b), although recent studies may improve our understanding (Kunz et al., 2020b). Additionally, behavioral changes can be misunderstood or misinterpreted by nursing staff (McAuliffe et al., 2009; Rababa, 2018a), and beliefs and expectations held by nurses affect the interpretation of pain behaviors (Rantala, 2014). Also, nurses and physicians report that observational tools have limited usefulness because the tools are difficult to integrate into practice and do not necessarily provide valuable information (De Witt Jansen et al., 2018).

Understanding pain perception in people with AD, and having valid tools to assess the pain in order to guide treatment, are especially important factors for clinicians providing care to this population. At least 50% of people with AD and AD-related dementias residing in nursing homes and in the general community are estimated to experience pain regularly (Corbett et al., 2012). Another review reported that up to 75% of individuals with AD experience pain regularly (de Tommaso et al., 2016). However, pain in people with AD is not adequately recognized or treated (Cravello et al., 2019; Hadjistavropoulos et al., 2014), and existing guidance has not been implemented into clinical practice (Jennings et al., 2018; May &amp; Scammell, 2020). For example, Monroe et al. (2012b) found that the rate of individuals with dementia who were not receiving any pain treatment was highest in those with the lowest MMSE scores (0–9). Additionally, 10% of those with very severe dementia were prescribed pro re nata (PRN) pain medications despite having great difficulty verbally communicating their needs (Monroe et al., 2012b). Another study characterized analgesic use in nursing home residents with known age-associated painful diseases (Neumann-Podczaska et al., 2016). Of the 392 total subjects with painful diseases, only 113 (28.8%) received pain management, and among these, only 84 (21.4%) used pain medication regularly, while 25 (6.4%) used the medications PRN. Of the 113 people receiving pain medications, 53 received non-narcotic medications, only nine received weak opioids, and one received a strong opioid (Neumann-Podczaska et al., 2016).

Clinicians may not be aware of these common practices that result in neglect of adequate care for older adults with cognitive impairment and pain. These studies provide evidence that the current treatment of people living with AD is not serving the purpose of helping them manage their pain. This calls for the development of new policy and methods of assessing and managing pain in AD, which should be built on an understanding of how the brain processes pain in AD. In the meantime, policies and official guidelines should include specific recommendations to use observational scales, such as the PAINAD or PAIC15, alongside the medical record and family or surrogate pain reports (Anderson et al., 2018) until new research offers improved options.

Pain Processing in AD

The experience of pain in AD remains unknown, and continued research is required to build evidence-based pain assessment and treatment; however, current evidence demonstrates that pain continues in AD. Preliminary neuroimaging findings demonstrate that major brain regions involved in pain processing continue to respond to painful stimuli in AD, but in ways that differ from that of healthy older adults (Cole et al., 2006; Cole et al., 2011; Monroe et al., 2017). Brain structures examined in these studies are found within the medial, lateral, and rostral pain networks, which overlap with the descending pain modulatory system (DPMS). The medial pain network represents the affective/motivational and cognitive/evaluative components of pain, including emotion, arousal, attention, memory, and unpleasant aspects of pain (Monroe et al., 2012a). The affective/motivational component includes what is thought of as “suffering from pain,” which would normally lead a person to communicate their dislike of the pain (Treede et al., 1999). The lateral pain network represents the sensory/discriminative components, which involve discrimination of the location, intensity, and quality of pain (Monroe et al., 2012a; Treede et al., 1999). The rostral pain network overlaps with the medial and lateral networks and represents the behavioral component of pain (Devinsky et al., 1995; Monroe et al., 2012a).

Findings based on pathology and autopsies demonstrate that the rostral (Tekin et al., 2001) and medial (Braak et al., 1999; Rub et al., 2002) regions are damaged earlier in AD, while the lateral (Braak et al., 1999; Rub et al., 2002) regions are damaged late into the disease process (Monroe et al., 2012a). The preservation of the lateral network may mean that regardless of the deterioration of other regions, the individual can still experience pain intensity, which has important clinical implications. Additionally, the functions of DPMS may be altered in mild and moderate AD, resulting in a diminished ability to inhibit pain (de Tommaso et al., 2016), possibly because of the earlier damage to the shared brain structures with the medial and rostral pain networks.

The DPMS regulates nociceptive processing to either facilitate or inhibit the sensation of pain (Millan, 2002; Tracey &amp; Mantyh, 2007), and therefore is heavily involved in the subjective experience of pain. The periaqueductal gray (PAG), part of the medial and rostral pain networks, plays an integral role in the DPMS (Purves, 2018; Tracey &amp; Mantyh, 2007). The PAG is also a primary site of endogenous opioid release and is substantially involved in the pain-relieving effects of exogenous opioid analgesics (Bodnar &amp; Heinricher, 2013). The PAG is damaged by AD (Brilliant et al., 1992; Iseki et al., 1989; Parvizi et al., 2000; Uematsu et al., 2018), and, consequently, there may be an altered pain experience in people with AD compared to healthy older adults. This may lead to an amplified pain experience if damage results in an insufficient endogenous opioid response to pain or to exogenous opioid analgesics.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental pain in people with AD demonstrated no significant differences in pain threshold, pain tolerance, or pain intensity ratings compared to healthy controls (Stubbs et al., 2016). However, people with AD were thought to be more sensitive to pain based on facial expressions of pain (Stubbs et al., 2016). Subsequent neuroimaging and psychophysical findings indicate that pain pathways in the brain in people with AD continue to respond to experimental pain, but in ways that are altered compared to responses of healthy older adults (Beach et al., 2017; Monroe et al., 2017; Monroe et al., 2016). Additionally, sex differences in pain responses were found in AD patients and older adults, suggesting further alterations from age and AD (Cowan et al., 2017; Romano et al., 2019).

Healthcare Policy Implications

Research on the neurobiology of pain in AD is beginning to better elucidate how pain pathways are affected by AD, and this new understanding leads us to conclude that people living with AD continue to experience pain and may have a decreased ability to inhibit pain. These individuals will also be less able to report their experiences of pain or respond to pain treatment as cognition becomes further impaired. We have few evidence-based guidelines to assist clinicians in their complex work of assessing pain and evaluating the efficacy of therapeutics. There are unique issues in the use of several of the current pharmacological interventions, as most individuals with AD are older adults and respond to drugs differently than younger individuals (AGS, 2019). Additionally, many of the nonpharmacological treatments useful for pain in healthy populations, such as cognitive-behavioral health approaches, may not be as effective in individuals with significant cognitive impairment.

These unique issues call for new healthcare policy to help guide research, education, and clinical practice in assessing and treating pain in people with AD. This call becomes even more strident when individuals with advanced AD have comorbid conditions such as cancer-related pain, in which cognitively intact patients report substantial pain.

One important policy recommendation is that new definitions of pain must be considered. Neither of the existing definitions from the ANA or the IASP are adequate when considering the effects of AD on pain pathways and communication. The ANA definition is built on the assumption that individuals are able to provide an accurate report of pain. The IASP wording leads many to also assume that a description of the felt pain is needed (Aydede, 2019). This is not possible when patients with AD are no longer able to verbally communicate. Crafting and gaining acceptance for a new definition of pain will be difficult in that the existing definitions have become inculcated in the practice of most clinicians who treat patients with pain. For now, emphasizing that the IASP definition can stand alone without the ending clause of “or described in terms of such damage” (IASP, 2018), and realizing that “or” is used (Aydede, 2019), may be helpful. Furthermore, including position statements like the one from the ASPMN on people who cannot self-report their pain (Herr et al., 2019) in broad reports and guidelines such as those from the HHS and Alzheimer-specific associations would help reach more clinicians and highlight this issue.

Substantial new research will be necessary to direct the development of guidelines for the assessment and treatment of pain in patients who are not able to communicate their pain. These clinical guidelines must be grounded in a better understanding of the neurobiology of pain in the brain, and therefore need to include additional neuroimaging and psychophysical experimental pain research in people with AD. Additionally, all general pain guidelines should include a notice that pain may be under-reported and under-recognized in AD and related dementias.

Nursing Policy and Guidelines Implications

Nurses are faced with almost an impossible task of conducting a comprehensive pain assessment strategy in people with advanced AD who are not be able to adequately verbally express their pain. Current research indicates that these individuals may also experience an amplified pain experience, leading to greater need of treatments for pain. The ASPMN and ANA’s official position statement supports the need for improved assessment and treatment of pain in populations such as AD and maintains that the nurse has “an ethical responsibility to relieve pain and the suffering it causes” (ANA, 2018, p. 1; ASPMN, 2020).

The ASPMN recently published a position statement regarding pain assessment in people who cannot self-report pain, including dementia patients (Herr et al., 2019, p. 403); it recommends the following:

Use the Hierarchy of Pain Assessment Techniques: Be aware of potential causes of pain, including known painful interventions;

Attempt self-report;

Observe patient behaviors;

Solicit reporting of pain and behavior/activity changes; and

Attempt analgesic trial.

Utilize behavioral pain assessment tools, as appropriate.

Minimize emphasis on vital signs.

Assess regularly, reassess postintervention, and document.

Consensus does not yet exist on exactly how pain should be assessed, by whom, or how frequently, or which analgesics or other pain-relieving interventions are the most appropriate in this unique group. Also, we do not yet have a good understanding of how nursing interventions need to differ in acute pain and chronic pain in people with advanced AD. Despite many gaps in our knowledge, these recommendations from the ASPMN are some of the most comprehensive available and need to be more widely disseminated and adopted by clinicians.

We realize that recommendations and clinical guidelines are based on the best limited evidence that is currently available, and this evidence may fall short of all that would be desirable. We fully support the view that evidence-based healthcare is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and the values of the patient and family. Clinicians and researchers are required to make a number of challenging judgements to achieve our goals of better care for individuals living with advanced AD and painful conditions.

Conclusion

Our best evidence is that clinicians do not achieve an adequate assessment or treatment of pain in people who are living with AD and are unable to accurately self-report their pain. New information concerning experimentally induced pain and pain response as measured by neuroimaging of pain processing is being added to our repertoire, and hopefully will subsequently assist clinicians in this highly complex yet vital work. Until clinicians have better knowledge, we conclude that the ethical approach is to lean toward overtreatment of pain in people with advanced AD, rather than undertreatment, which can otherwise compound suffering and worsen comorbidities. Working collaboratively with other providers and care services, such as palliative care and hospice, may be the most beneficial holistic form of care we can offer for this population and their caregivers at this time. Furthermore, major reports and pain guidelines need to specify that pain may be under-reported and under-recognized in AD and related dementias, and should highlight the recommendations in the position statement from the ASPMN on people who cannot self-report their pain.
