Objectives:

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that late life cognitive activity is associated with decision making in older adults and to examine whether this association varies by level of cognitive function.

Design:

This study employed a cross-sectional design.

Setting:

All data were collected in participants’ community-based residences.

Participants:

Participants were 1084 older adults (mean age=81.05 years, SD=7.53) without dementia (median MMSE score=29, IQR=27.86 – 30.00).

Measurements:

Participants completed assessments of late life cognitive activity, cognitive function, and decision making. We used linear regression models to examine the associations of late life cognitive activity and cognitive function with decision making.

Results:

In a regression model adjusted for age, gender, and education, more frequent late life cognitive activity was associated with better decision making, as was higher cognitive function. Furthermore, in an additional model that included the interaction of late life cognitive activity and cognitive function, the interaction was significant, such that late life cognitive activity was most strongly associated with decision making among participants with lower levels of cognitive function.

Conclusions:

Frequent engagement in late life cognitive activity may help maintain decision making among older persons, particularly among those with lower levels of cognitive function.

Older Adults
Cognitive Aging
Late Life Cognitive Activity
Decision Making

Objectives

Healthcare and financial decision making represents a key determinant of health and wellbeing for older adults in the United States (1-3). However, many older adults are vulnerable to suboptimal decision making in these domains (4-7). For instance, older adults have difficulties with Medicare Part D, particularly in understanding eligibility criteria, taking part in enrollment processes, and obtaining cost-effective prescription drug coverage (8, 9). Financial decision making also presents challenges for older adults, resulting in fees for late credit card payments, subprime home equity loans and lines of credit, and mismanagement of retirement funds (1, 10, 11). Overall, poor healthcare and financial decision making is associated with detrimental outcomes for older adults, including incident dementia, mortality, susceptibility to financial fraud and scams, and cost-related medication nonadherence (12-15). Hence, it is important to identify modifiable factors that may help maintain or improve healthcare and financial decision making among older adults.

In addition to cognitive function, evidence suggests that protective and modifiable experiential factors may contribute to decision making in older age, including engagement in mentally stimulating activities such as reading books or magazines (7, 16-21). Engagement in cognitive activity may bolster the quality of a person’s decision making as they may spend more time searching for and understanding relevant information (22-26). Frequent engagement in cognitive activity has been linked to positive health outcomes in aging, such as better cognitive functioning, slower cognitive decline, and decreased risk of Alzheimer’s dementia (27-30). However, previous research has not investigated the association between cognitive activity and decision making among older adults.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that late life cognitive activity is associated with decision making and to examine whether this association differs by level of cognitive function. Secondarily, we aimed to understand whether the association of late life cognitive activity with decision making is independent of other factors including late life social activity and physical activity. Lastly, we examined whether the association of late life cognitive activity with decision making varies by level of five specific cognitive domains (i.e. episodic memory, visuospatial ability, perceptual speed, semantic memory, and working memory). Study results may provide insight into the role of late life cognitive activity, a potentially modifiable factor that may facilitate improved decision making outcomes among older adults.

Methods

Participants

Participants were from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), an ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging (31, 32). MAP began enrollment in 1997, with recruitment of non-demented older adults who are tested within their community-based residences. MAP participation includes a detailed clinical evaluation consisting of medical history, neurological testing, and neuropsychological examination; risk factor assessment, and brain donation at death. A MAP substudy on decision making began in 2010, with assessments of healthcare and financial decision making, risk aversion, and scam susceptibility (33, 34). Both studies were approved by a Rush University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All participants signed an informed consent document for each study. Data can be requested at https:\\www.radc.rush.edu.

The current study was restricted to persons without dementia who completed the baseline assessment of decision making. Of 2102 participants who completed a MAP baseline evaluation, 642 died before the decision making substudy, 77 withdrew from MAP, and 68 either moved away from the area or were ineligible due to severe comprehension or sensory limitations. Of the 1315 alive and eligible MAP participants, 127 participants had not yet completed the decision making substudy at the time of the current analyses. Of the remaining 1188 participants, 66 were diagnosed with dementia and 38 had missing data on late life cognitive activity. As a result, 1084 participants were included in the current analyses.

Assessment of Late Life Cognitive Activity

Late life cognitive activity was assessed using a self-report measure that quantified engagement in mentally stimulating activities (35, 36). Seven items assessed time spent reading per day and the frequency of six activities during the past year including library visits, reading newspapers, reading magazines, reading books, writing letters, and playing games such as cards or puzzles. The amount of time spent reading was assessed using the following 5-point Likert scale: 1=none, 2=less than one hour, 3=one to less than two hours, 4=two to less than three hours, and 5=three or more hours. The remaining six items were assessed using the following 5-point Likert scale: 1=every day/almost every day, 2=several times a week, 3=several times a month, 4=several times a year, and 5=once a year or less. All scores were reverse-coded and averaged (range=1-5), with higher scores indicating more frequent late life cognitive activity. The measure has demonstrated psychometric soundness, and is associated with other important decision making resources (i.e. cognitive function) and positive outcomes in old age (i.e. better cognitive functioning and slower cognitive decline) (28, 30, 35, 36).

Assessment of Healthcare and Financial Decision Making

Healthcare and financial decision making was measured using a modified version (i.e. shortened as needed for use in an epidemiological study) of a validated healthcare and financial decision making instrument developed for use in older adults and to reflect feasible real-world healthcare and financial decisions that they may face (4, 21, 37). The modified measure consisted of 12 items - a 6 item healthcare component and a 6 item financial component. Each component consisted of three simple items and three complex items. Items were designed to mimic the types of healthcare and financial decisions older adults encounter in their daily lives. Participants viewed tables displaying information about HMO plans or mutual funds then answered questions requiring comprehension and integration of the tabulated information. For example, one simple healthcare item consisted of a table displaying five characteristics of three HMO plans (i.e. member satisfaction, preventive care strategies, access to specialists, customer service, and premiums), and asked participants the following question: “You don’t want any HMO that is below average on member satisfaction OR below average on access to specialists. Based on the information in the table, which HMO should you choose?” One complex healthcare item displayed the same five characteristics for six additional HMO plans (i.e. nine plans in total) and asked participants the following question: “You don’t want any HMO that is below average on member satisfaction, customer service, or access to specialists. Finally, you DO want an HMO that is above average on preventive care strategies. Based on the information in the table below, which HMO should you choose?” The total number of items answered correctly was summed for each participant (range=0-12), with higher scores indicating better decision making. The modified measure has demonstrated sufficient internal consistency, and is associated with other important decision making resources (i.e. cognitive function, health and financial literacy, and risk aversion) and adverse outcomes in old age (i.e. accelerated cognitive decline, incident Alzheimer’s dementia, and mortality) (15, 21, 38).

Assessment of Cognitive Function

Participants completed a battery of 21 performance-based measures of cognitive function (31, 39). Two tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Complex Ideational Material, were used for descriptive or diagnostic purposes only. The remaining 19 performance-based tests assessed 5 domains of cognitive function: 1) episodic memory (7 tests: Word List Memory, Recall, and Recognition from the CERAD neuropsychological battery; immediate and delayed recall of Logical Memory Story A and the East Boston Story); 2) visuospatial ability (2 tests: Judgment of Line Orientation and Standard Progressive Matrices); 3) perceptual speed (4 tests: the oral version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Number Comparison, Stroop Color Naming, and Stroop Word Reading); 4) semantic memory (3 tests: Category Fluency, Boston Naming, and the National Adult Reading Test); and 5) working memory (3 tests: Digit Span subtests [forward and backward] of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and Digit Ordering). Participants’ raw scores on each of the 19 tests were converted to z-scores using the baseline mean and standard deviation of the full MAP cohort (36). All 19 z-scores were averaged to yield a composite score of global cognitive function for each participant. The five specific cognitive domains were calculated by averaging the z-scores from the tests in each cognitive domain.

Clinical Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Dementia

Participants underwent structured clinical evaluations including a review of medical history, neurological examination, and cognitive function testing. A clinician then classified persons regarding dementia using the criteria of the Joint Working Group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (40).

Other Covariates

Late life cognitive activity represents one distinct component of a healthy lifestyle for older adults, which often also includes late life social activity and physical activity. Participation in both late life social activity and physical activity have been associated with decreased cognitive impairment in older adults (41, 42). Hence, it was important to account for potential impacts of late life social activity and physical activity in analyses examining associations between late life cognitive activity and decision making. We measured late life social activity using six items assessing the frequency of participation in events such as visits with family and friends on a 5-point Likert scale (1=every day or almost every day to 5=once a year or less) (41). Items were reverse-coded then averaged with higher scores signaling more late life social activity. We adapted the 1985 National Health Interview Survey to measure physical activity (43). Participants reported if they engaged in five activities, including walking for exercise and bicycle riding, within the past two weeks (44). If so, participants reported the number of times and average minutes per occasion that they engaged in each activity. Minutes in each activity were summed and divided by 120 to yield a composite score of weekly physical activity, with higher numbers indicating more physical activity. All participants reported their gender (i.e. male or female), date of birth, and years of education.

Analyses

First, we assessed bivariate associations of demographics, late life cognitive activity, global cognitive function, five domains of cognitive function, and other covariates with decision making using Pearson correlations or t-tests, as appropriate. Second, we examined associations of late life cognitive activity and cognitive function with decision making (the continuous outcome variable) in a series of linear regression models. To test the first part of our hypothesis, the initial model examined direct associations of both late life cognitive activity and global cognitive function with decision making after adjusting for age, gender, and years of education. We then added an interaction term for late life cognitive activity with global cognitive function to the model to test the second part of our hypothesis that the association of late life cognitive activity with decision making varies by level of cognitive function. Third, to address potential confounding by late life social activity and physical activity, we expanded our previous model by further adjusting for late life social activity and physical activity as well as their interactions with global cognitive function. Lastly, we repeated the primary analysis with five specific cognitive domains as predictors, in lieu of global cognitive function, using five separate linear regression models. Estimates from linear regression models represent unstandardized regression coefficients. All analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.3 of the SAS system for Linux.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Participants were 93% White and more than three-quarters were women. Additional descriptive information is reported in Table 1. Older age (Pearson’s r=−0.31, p&lt;.0001) was associated with lower scores on the decision making measure; and more years of education (Pearson’s r=0.36, p&lt;.0001), higher levels of cognitive function (Pearson’s r=0.57, p&lt;.0001), and more frequent late life cognitive activity (Pearson’s r=0.34, p&lt; 0001) were associated with higher scores on the decision making measure. Additionally, women (Mean=7.74, SD=2.67) scored lower on the decision making measure compared to men (Mean=8.67, SD=2.44) (t1082 = −5.01, p&lt;0.0001).

Associations of Late Life Cognitive Activity and Cognitive Function with Decision Making

Direct Associations of Late Life Cognitive Activity and Global Cognitive Function with Decision Making

First, to examine direct associations of both late life cognitive activity and global cognitive function with decision making, we performed a linear regression model with decision making as the outcome and terms for age, gender, years of education, late life cognitive activity, and global cognitive function. More frequent late life cognitive activity was related to better decision making (estimate=0.72, standard error [SE]=0.10, t1077=7.09, p&lt;0.0001). Compared to participants with less frequent late life cognitive activity (i.e. 10th percentile), those with more frequent late life cognitive activity (i.e. 90th percentile) scored 1.24 points higher on the decision making measure; this is equivalent to a difference between people who are 24 years apart in age (i.e. participants in the 10th percentile of late life cognitive activity had decision making scores of people more than two decades older). Higher global cognitive function was also associated with better decision making (estimate=2.20, SE =0.14, t1077=16.13, p&lt;0.0001), suggesting that late life cognitive activity and global cognitive function are independently related to decision making.

Interaction between Late Life Cognitive Activity and Global Cognitive Function with Decision Making

To examine whether the association of late life cognitive activity with decision making varied by level of global cognitive function, we repeated the linear regression model above with an additional term for the interaction between late life cognitive activity and global cognitive function. Direct associations remained for both late life cognitive activity (estimate=0.81, SE=0.10, t1075=7.81, p&lt;0.0001) and global cognitive function (estimate=2.28, SE=0.14, t1075=16.66, p&lt;0.0001). In addition, the interaction was significant (estimate=−0.69, SE=0.17, t1075= −4.05, p&lt;0.0001), such that the association of late life cognitive activity with decision making was strongest among participants with lower levels of global cognitive function. See Figure 1.

Potential Confounders: Late Life Social Activity and Physical Activity

Next, to address potential confounders of late life social activity and physical activity, we augmented the previous model by including terms for late life social activity and physical activity as well as their interactions with global cognitive function. Late life social activity and physical activity were not significantly associated with decision making and did not interact with global cognitive function in relation to decision making. More importantly, the finding that the association of late life cognitive activity with decision making was strongest among persons with lower levels of global cognitive function remained the same. See Table 2.

Interactions between Late Life Cognitive Activity and Five Specific Cognitive Domains

Lastly, we explored the interactions of late life cognitive activity with five cognitive domains on decision making. We observed significant interactions between late life cognitive activity and visuospatial ability, perceptual speed, and working memory, such that late life cognitive activity was most strongly associated with decision making among persons with poorer visuospatial ability, perceptual speed, and working memory. See Table 3.

Supplementary Analyses: Health and Financial Literacy

To explore the role of health and financial literacy, we augmented our primary model by including terms for health and financial literacy as well as its interaction with late life cognitive activity. Direct associations remained for both late life cognitive activity (estimate=0.68, SE=0.11, t1072=6.43, p&lt;0.0001) and global cognitive function (estimate=1.50, SE=0.15, t1072=9.83, p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, the interaction between late life cognitive activity and global cognitive function (estimate=−0.42, SE=0.21, t1072=−2.07, p=0.04) remained significant. A direct association was found for health and financial literacy (estimate=0.06, SE=0.01, t1072=10.01, p&lt;0.0001), such that better health and financial literacy was associated with improved decision making. Late life cognitive activity did not interact with health and financial literacy in relation to decision making.

Conclusions

The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that late life cognitive activity is associated with healthcare and financial decision making and to examine whether this association varies by level of cognitive function in community-dwelling, non-demented older adults. Results indicated that more frequent late life cognitive activity was associated with better decision making, above and beyond cognitive function. Further, the association of frequent late life cognitive activity was strongest among participants with lower levels of cognitive function. Findings related to late life cognitive activity persisted after adjusting for late life social activity and physical activity, suggesting a distinct role for late life cognitive activity in relation to decision making. Lastly, late life cognitive activity interacted with several specific cognitive abilities, such that frequent late life cognitive activity was associated with better decision making especially among participants with poorer visuospatial ability, perceptual speed, and working memory.

The current study addresses a gap in the literature by examining the role of late life cognitive activity - a potentially modifiable factor - in decision making in old age. Previous literature has suggested that a person’s motivation to engage in complex cognitive activity may impact decision making (24). Indeed, participation in mentally stimulating activities in late life have been positively linked to other elements of cognitive health such as bolstered cognitive reserve, better cognitive functioning, and slower cognitive decline (28, 36, 45, 46). However, to our knowledge, previous studies have not examined the role of late life cognitive activity - independent of cognitive function - in relation to decision making among older adults or tested a possible interaction between late life cognitive activity and cognitive function. Current results suggest that frequent participation in mentally stimulating activities may directly and positively impact decision making and related behaviors among older adults, in general, but especially among those at lower levels of global cognitive function. Perhaps frequently participating in cognitive activity supports decision making quality as a person, especially those with lower levels of cognitive function, may devote more time pursuing and understanding applicable information (22-26).

In analyses of specific cognitive abilities, we found that late life cognitive activity was most strongly associated with decision making for older adults with poorer visuospatial ability, perceptual speed, and working memory. It is not entirely clear why late life cognitive activity interacted with specific cognitive domains and not others, but we speculate that late life cognitive activity may improve decision making in part by enhancing mental processing efficiency and attentional abilities (20). Overall, more research is needed to better understand the mechanism(s) in which late life cognitive activity works and how it interacts with specific cognitive abilities to improve decision making.

Overall, the current study indicates an important relationship between more frequent late life cognitive activity and better decision making, especially for persons with lower levels of cognitive function, and raises the notion that more frequent late life cognitive activity might help preserve decision making in old age. The current study has limitations and strengths. One limitation is the homogeneity among study participants regarding race and gender (93% White and 76% women, respectively) as well as the relatively high years of education of participants (mean years=15.60, SD=3.11). Currently, we are collecting decision making data among more diverse older adults. A second limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the current study. Longitudinal data collection in MAP is ongoing, and we will be able to examine how late life cognitive activity is related to change in decision making in future analyses. A third potential limitation is that the findings in the current study may not translate to broader or a different set of healthcare and financial decisions faced by older adults. Hence, future research is needed to explore the impacts of late life cognitive activity on decision making using additional measures, including the assessment of more aspects of decision making such as appreciating the consequences of a decision and reasoning. Conversely, this study has several strengths including a well-characterized group of community-dwelling older adults without dementia. We used established measures of late life cognitive activity, cognitive function, and healthcare and financial decision making. We also adjusted for important covariates including late life social activity and physical activity, which increases confidence in our findings.

Highlights:

1) What is the primary question addressed by this study? — Is late life cognitive activity directly associated with cognitive function, and is this association stronger among various levels of cognitive function?

2) What is the main finding of this study? More frequent engagement in late life cognitive activity is associated with better decision making. Furthermore, more frequent engagement in late life cognitive activity was most strongly associated with better decision making among participants with lower levels of cognitive function.

3) What is the meaning of the finding?— Frequent engagement in late life cognitive activity may help maintain decision making among older persons, particularly among those with lower levels of cognitive function.
