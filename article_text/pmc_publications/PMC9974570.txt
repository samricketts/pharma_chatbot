Introduction:

The Perceived Research Burden Assessment (PeRBA) was developed to measure participant perceptions of burden in research studies. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of this assessment using Rasch analysis in participants in longitudinal studies of Alzheimer disease (AD) and their family members.

Methods:

PeRBA was administered to 443 participants in studies of AD and 212 family members across four Alzheimer Disease Research Centers. We used Rasch analysis to examine PeRBA’s psychometric properties and data-model fit both at item and scale levels.

Results:

PeRBA demonstrated good reliability and item and person fit for participants and family members. A few items did not fit the model for participants or family members. Areas of content redundancy were found in items assessing similar amounts of perceived research burden. Areas of content gaps were also found, with no items assessing certain levels of perceived research burden.

Conclusion:

Analysis results support the good overall psychometric properties of PeRBA among research participants in studies of AD and their family members. Recommendations have been provided to improve the assessment, including rewording items and adding items that could account for a broader range of perceived research burden.

pmcIntroduction

Dedicated participants in longitudinal Alzheimer disease (AD) studies are crucial to advance our understanding of the progression of AD. In these studies, participants complete assessments of cognition and AD biomarkers, which can require magnetic resonance imaging scans and lumbar punctures. They must also have a reliable informant or study partner, often a family member, whose involvement is essential to gather accurate data on the daily functioning of participants and report changes over time.

Participants in longitudinal AD studies face burdens, including risks associated with research procedures, inconvenience of procedures, emotional or physical invasiveness, and even the family member’s perceptions, that may influence participation or quality of participation.1 Collectively, these factors are referred to as perceived research burden.1 Perceived burden may impact an individual’s decision to participate in a research study or the quality of their participation.2–4 In fact, complaints of research burden from longitudinal AD study participants have been associated with lower attendance and a greater likelihood of dropping out.5 Making “participant-friendly” modifications and decreasing mental fatigue have been associated with improved participant engagement and data quality.3, 4 Understanding perceived research burden can help researchers design studies to have lower perceived burden and improve participant recruitment, retention, and data quality.

To our knowledge, the Perceived Research Burden Assessment (PeRBA) is the only assessment that attempts to conceptualize and measure perceived research burden. PeRBA has two versions: one for participants (PeRBA-Participant) and one for their family members (PeRBA-Family member).6 It can be administered prior to participants enrolling in a study (pre-enrollment) or after they are already enrolled in a study (post-enrollment). PeRBA items belong to one of three domains: (1) logistical burden, including accessibility, time, and finance-related burdens; (2) psychological burden, presenting in emotional challenges; or (3) physical burden, such as physical symptoms of pain or fatigue. The PeRBA-Participant has been psychometrically tested using classical test theory techniques and has good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87–0.96) and initial evidence of both convergent and discriminant validity for the pre-enrollment version,6 as well as cross-validation of the psychometric stability of the post-enrollment version of PeRBA.7 Factor analysis revealed PeRBA to measure a unidimensional latent construct of participant burden.6, 7

Rasch analysis has not been used to psychometrically evaluate the participant and family member versions of PeRBA at item and domain/scale levels. Rasch analysis places a person’s “ability,” or the amount of the latent trait, such as perceived research burden, and one’s likelihood of endorsing an item or item difficulty on a single, linear scale that allows for direct comparison.8 This analysis can be used to develop and refine assessment tools. Extending upon previous work with this sample that examined the participant version using classical test theory techniques,7 the objective of this study is to apply Rasch analysis techniques to evaluate PeRBA in participants in longitudinal AD studies and their family members. We aim to examine the psychometric properties and model fit of PeRBA and to provide recommendations to enhance its measurement of perceived research burden for use in AD studies as well as other populations and settings.

Methods

Participants and procedures

PeRBA and demographic data were collected as part of a larger, multicenter study of participants in longitudinal studies of AD.5, 7 A standardized protocol was used across all four Alzheimer Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) involved: Knight ADRC at Washington University in St. Louis (Knight ADRC); University of Pittsburgh ADRC (PITT ADRC); University of Wisconsin ADRC (Wisconsin ADRC); and University of California–Irvine ADRC (UCI ADRC). PeRBA was administered as part of a 20-minute survey about participation in longitudinal AD studies from 2018–2019.

At each ADRC, currently enrolled participants and family members/study partners were eligible to participate if they were aged 45 or older and had a Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR)9 ≤ 1 at their most recent clinical assessment. Individuals were not eligible to participate if they were institutionalized or living outside the geographic area of the ADRC.

Eligible participants and family members were invited to participate in the study in person at the ADRC or by phone. Informed consent was completed in writing for those recruited in person and verbally by those recruited by phone. Descriptive analyses were performed using SPSS 28.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Additional information about the study procedures have been published previously.5 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the four ADRCs.

Measures

PeRBA

Two versions of PeRBA were administered: PeRBA-Participant and PeRBA-Family member. PeRBA-Participant contains 21 items to obtain participant perception of burden in the study. PeRBA-Family member contains 25 items; 21 items are modified from the PeRBA-Participant to obtain the family member’s perception of burden, and four items measure their perception of the participant’s burden in the study (e.g., “I feel that researchers ask my family member or friend too many questions”; Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Examples of PeRBA items include, “I feel that study visits are too frequent” and “I feel that researchers ask me questions that are too personal.” All responses are rated on a 5-point Likert scale from (1) strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree, with higher values indicating greater burden. The post-enrollment wording of items was used to assess perceived burden in the longitudinal studies in which the participants and family members were already enrolled (Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Psychometric analysis

Rasch analysis was conducted using WINSTEPS version 5.1.7.10 It converts ordinal item response data into equal-interval data represented on a linear scale.11, 12 Person measures and item measures are obtained from Rasch analysis. Person measures indicate the person’s perceived research burden, which is the level of the latent trait that the tool is assessing, with a higher score indicating greater burden. Item measures indicate the difficulty of each item to endorse (in this case, to agree that the item is burdensome). The Rating Scale Model was used to analyze the data, as the data fit its assumptions.13 Several criteria used to examine the psychometric properties of PeRBA are discussed below.

Wright map

The Wright map organizes measures of person-perceived participant burden and item difficulties on the same linear scale (less to more).8 In the Wright maps for this study, items that were more difficult to endorse, indicating greater burden, and persons with more perceived burden are at the top of the map, and easier-to-endorse items and persons with less perceived burden are at the bottom of the map. This graphical representation can be used to visualize the distributions of persons and items and to identify potential gaps of items along the underlying construct being measured (i.e., perceived burden).

Person and item fit

Fit statistics examine whether the persons and items fit the specified model and whether the items measure what they intend to.12 We evaluated mean-square (MNSQ) fit statistics. These represent a chi-square statistic measuring the association between the model-data fit and the data.8 MNSQ infit and outfit statistics between 0.5 and 1.7 have been deemed adequate.8, 12, 14 Items with MNSQ values outside this range may be misfitting or over-fitting items, which may indicate redundancy.15 The outfit statistic is more sensitive to outliers.12

Reliability

Person and item reliability and separation statistics are reported in Rasch analysis. Reliability, analogous to Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, of 0.9 and above is considered excellent. Person separation examines whether a test can differentiate between participants with high and low scores. Item separation examines the accuracy of each item in order of difficulty.8 Separation statistics theoretically range from 0 to positive infinity, and a value of 2.0 or above is considered strong. WINSTEPS also reports Cronbach’s alpha as a measure of internal consistency.

Dimensionality and local independence

Each PeRBA item belongs to one of three domains of burden: logistical, physical, or psychological. To evaluate whether PeRBA measures one or multiple dimensions of perceived burden, a principal component analysis (PCA) of standardized residuals was performed. An eigenvalue of the first residual factor smaller than 3 was used to determine whether additional factors were likely to be present in the residuals.16 Disattenuated correlations may be examined to determine the local independence between contrasts. High correlation (&gt;0.30) of residuals indicates that they may not be locally independent; they may duplicate some feature of each other or may incorporate another shared dimension.16 We analyzed the three subscales separately and combined for participants and family members.

Differential item functioning

We assessed differential item functioning (DIF) to examine whether the items are measuring the same level of the latent trait (perceived research burden) for all groups completing the assessment. We assessed DIF by respondent type (participant or family member) to examine whether some items may be relatively more difficult to endorse for one type of respondent compared to the other. For this analysis, we included the 21 items from the participant and family member versions of PeRBA. We considered a DIF contrast of ≥ 0.5 logits between the two groups and a significance level of p &lt; 0.05 to indicate the presence of DIF.16 If significant and meaningful DIF is found, it may indicate that the interpretation of the item differs by group (i.e., participant or family member).

Results

A total of 443 participants completed the PeRBA-Participant. Participants were, on average, 67 years of age, mostly female (59%), and mostly White (79%; Table 1). A total of 212 family members completed the PeRBA-Family member. Family members were, on average, 67 years of age, mostly female (65%), and mostly White (69%; see Table 1).

Psychometric analysis and Wright maps

Item difficulty hierarchy

Item measures are shown in Table 2 for both the PeRBA-Participant and the PeRBA-Family member. The items are organized by measure order; the most difficult items to endorse are at the top, indicating higher burden, and the easiest-to-endorse items are at the bottom, indicating less burden. In general, items were placed in similar locations on both the participant and family member versions of the assessment. The most difficult item to endorse was Regret (“I regret my decision to participate in this study”), and the easiest items to endorse were Visit Time (“I feel that study visits are too long”), Distance (“I feel that the research site is too far away”), Fatigue (“I became fatigued from the research procedures”), and Inconvenient (“I feel that it is inconvenient to get to the research site”).

Individual Wright maps were constructed to evaluate and compare the item hierarchy of the PeRBA-Participant and the PeRBA-Family member. Figure 1 shows a Wright map with perceived research burden and item difficulty-to-endorse (i.e., that it is burdensome) on the same linear scale for the PeRBA-Participant version and PeRBA-Family member version, respectively (see Supplemental Digital Content 1 for each item and wording of full questions). The measures from participants or family members are plotted on the left side of the maps, and items are on the right side. Participants with higher perceived research burden and items that were more difficult to endorse (indicating higher burden), such as Regret, are at the top of the map. When multiple items are mapped on the same line of the Wright map, such as Transportation Cost, Health, and Family Time in the PeRBA-Participant and Contact, Health, and Side Effects in the PeRBA-Family member, the items have very similar item measures. This indicates that the items assess the same level of perceived research burden and may be redundant. (i.e., they measure the same thing). This may be explained by the items containing similar content. This can also be viewed in measure values shown in Table 2 (higher measure values indicate greater difficulty to endorse the item).

PeRBA-Participant and PeRBA-Family member Wright maps show that there are gaps in the levels of perceived research burden with no items that measure that level of burden. Assessment gaps identify opportunities to add items at this difficulty level to assess perceived research burden more comprehensively. On both the PeRBA-Participant and the PeRBA-Family member, there are gaps in items that correspond to lower amounts of perceived research burden (Figure 1).

To compare how the items that are on both the participant and family member versions of the PeRBA (items 1–21) may function similarly or differently between these two study populations, the respective item measures were plotted on a graph (Figure 2). Items plotted closest to a 45-degree angle (called the identity line) indicate similar difficulty to endorse for participants and family members, signaling concordance. Items plotted further from the identity line indicate that the measures are not as similar between respondents, signaling discordance. Of note, the items Emotional (“I feel that I became emotionally upset by the study procedures”), Physical Pain (“I experienced physical pain or discomfort while participating in this study”), and Regret (“I regret my decision to participate in this study”) all had higher participant measures compared to family member measures, meaning that the items were more difficult to endorse (indicating greater perceived burden) for participants compared to their family members. The item Family and Friend Time (“I feel that study visits take away from time with my friends and family”) had a higher family member measure compared to participant measure, indicating that it was more difficult for the family members to endorse the burden associated with this item.

Item and person fit

Analysis of PeRBA-Participant and PeRBA-Family member demonstrated good outfit statistics (MNSQ ranging between 0.51 and 1.66) for all items except for two (Fatigue and Physical Pain) that had &gt;1.7 outfit MNSQ for both versions of the assessment (see Table 2).

Reliability

Reliability and separation statistics were high (see Table 2). Item reliability for both versions of the assessment were very strong (PeRBA-Participant: 0.97, PeRBA-Family member: 0.93). Person reliability for both versions was also strong (PeRBA-Participant: 0.87, PeRBA-Family member: 0.88). Cronbach’s alpha was 0.92 for both versions of the assessment. High person separation statistics indicate that the PeRBA-Participant (2.55) and the PeRBA-Family member (2.66) effectively distinguish between people perceiving high and low research burden. Good item separation statistics (PeRBA-Participant: 6.07, PeRBA-Family member: 3.73) indicate that the test items are organized hierarchically.

Dimensionality and local independence

The PCA analysis supported PeRBA unidimensionality for the PeRBA-Participant and PeRBA-Family member, although the first contrast on the PeRBA-Family member had an eigenvalue above our prespecified value of 3 (3.19). The first contrast on the PeRBA-Family member included all four items that are unique to this assessment, which ask specifically about their perceptions of the participant’s experiences as opposed to their own. There were moderate-to-high disattenuated correlations among the three proposed constructs on the PeRBA-Participant (r = 0.39–0.72) and the PeRBA-Family member (r = 0.52–0.69). Of note, the first contrast included two items, Physical Pain and Fatigue for the PeRBA-Participant, that were identified with high outfit in previous analyses.

Differential item functioning

PeRBA items did not show DIF by respondent group (participant or family member) for any items using our prespecified criteria (≥0.5 DIF contrast in logits and p &lt; 0.05). Three items were statistically significant but had DIF contrast less than 0.5 logits (Family and Friend Time, Transportation Cost, and Physical Pain). The item Family and Friend Time (“I feel that study visits take away from time with my friends and family”) was easier for participants to endorse than family members (DIF contrast: −0.40 logits, p &lt; 0.01). The item Transportation Cost (“I feel that it costs too much to get to the research center”) was also easier for participants to endorse compared to family members (DIF contrast: −0.28 logits, p = 0.02). In contrast, the item Physical Pain (“I experienced physical pain or discomfort while participating in this study”) was easier for family members to endorse than participants (DIF contrast: 0.41, p = 0.01). However, because the DIF contrast was less than 0.5 logits for each, these differences in item functioning may not be clinically meaningful.

Discussion

Participation in longitudinal AD studies is vital to advancing our understanding of the disease. Perceived burden among participants and their family members in AD research is understudied. Perceived research burden may influence recruitment, retention, and quality of participation in rigorous studies. PeRBA is a tool to measure perceived burden in research participants. Rasch analysis supports the good overall psychometric properties of PeRBA among research participants in AD studies and their family members. Recommendations on new items or item rewording are provided to improve measurement precision.

Reliability and fit statistics derived from Rasch analysis suggest that PeRBA is a useful, unidimensional tool to measure perceived research burden; our findings are consistent with the original and more recent psychometric testing of the assessment.6, 7 Wright maps and item measures demonstrate areas of redundancy in the amount of perceived research burden PeRBA items measure, as well as gaps where no items correspond to other levels of perceived research burden.

Three items (Regret, Physical Pain, and Emotional) had notable differences in difficulty based on respondent type, potentially signaling a higher degree of discordance between the participant and family member versions (see Figure 2), indicating that these items may be perceived differently by participants and family members. This may be of particular importance, as these family members may become caregivers or involved in care decisions if the participant develops AD. A higher degree of discordance on items suggests that researchers should ask caregivers and patients their perspectives on these items in particular whenever possible, as these items may capture different perspectives compared to other PeRBA items.

We found no items where DIF was present when comparing participant and family member responses, indicating that the items function similarly among both types of respondents (participants and family members). Three items were statistically significant in DIF but may not be clinically meaningful because their DIF contrast logits were less than 0.5. The items Family and Friend Time and Transportation Cost were easier for participants to endorse compared to family members, while the item Physical Pain was easier for family members to endorse compared to participants.

Based on the results of the Rasch analysis, we have a few recommendations to improve PeRBA (Table 3). First, two items may be outliers as evidenced by outfit MNSQ values in the participant and family member versions of PeRBA. These items are Physical Pain (“I experienced physical pain or discomfort from participating in this study”) and Fatigue (“I became fatigued from the research procedures”). While distinctively low ratings on these items may be expected given the observational nature of the research being appraised, these items may be influenced by other factors in participants’ lives and not solely on the research procedures. We recommend altering the wording of these items to focus on concepts related to the research procedures, such as, “The research procedures caused me to experience physical pain or discomfort.” We also recommend separating fatigue into “physical fatigue from the research procedures” and “cognitive fatigue from the research procedures” (see Table 3).

Another recommendation is to reduce redundancy in items measuring a similar amount of perceived research burden (see Table 2 and Figure 1). For example, the item Distance (“I feel that the research site is too far away”) has a similar measure value to the item Inconvenient (“I feel that it might be inconvenient to get to the research center”). We recommend clarifying the wording of the item and providing a reference point, such as “I feel that the research site is too far away from my home or work.” We made additional recommendations for wording changes to create distinction and clarity in responses in Table 3.

A final recommendation is to modify existing items or create items to fill gaps in the assessment based on experience interacting with research participants. For example, we recommend adding two items related to perceived burden of contact with study personnel: “I feel that it was hard to reach research staff when I had questions or concerns,” and “It was hard to reschedule a research visit.” There are more gaps in item measures on the lower end of perceived research burden, indicating the need for items to capture a lower amount of perceived burden. This may also increase sensitivity of the assessment.

This study has limitations. Our sample of research participants is enrolled in quite demanding longitudinal studies of AD, and their interpretation of PeRBA items may not be generalizable to other populations. In addition, we did not test our recommendations to improve PeRBA. The recommendations are informed by the study results and hypothesized solutions from research team members with experience administering and analyzing PeRBA.

Future research utilizing Rasch analysis should evaluate PeRBA item functioning with various characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, in different populations with other neurological diseases, and potentially creating a PeRBA short form that demonstrates similar psychometric qualities to the full-length assessment. Similarly, alterations to PeRBA item wording to increase clarity, reduce item redundancy, and fill gaps in item difficulty should be further analyzed using Rasch analysis.
