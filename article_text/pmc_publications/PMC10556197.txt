Background:

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) history is associated with dementia risk, but it is unclear whether TBI history significantly hastens neurocognitive decline in older adults.

Method:

Data were derived from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Participants without a history of TBI (TBI+; n=1,467) were matched to individuals without history of TBI (TBI-; n=1,467) based on age (50-97, M=71.61, SD=8.40), sex, education, race, ethnicity, cognitive diagnosis, functional decline, number of Apolipoprotein Ε4 (APOE ε4) alleles, and number of annual visits (3 to 6). Mixed linear models were used to assess longitudinal neuropsychological test composite scores of executive functioning/attention/speed, language, and memory in TBI+ and TBI− participants. Interactions between TBI and demographics, APOE ε4 status, and cognitive diagnosis were also examined.

Results:

Longitudinal neuropsychological functioning did not differ between TBI groups (p’s &gt; .001). There was a significant 3-way interaction (age, TBI history, time) in language (F [20, 5750.1] =3.133, p &lt; .001) and memory performance (F [20, 6580.8] = 3.386, p &lt; .001), but post-hoc analyses revealed TBI history was not driving this relationship (all p’s &gt; .096). No significant interactions were observed between TBI history and sex, education, race/ethnicity, number of APOE ε4 status, or cognitive diagnosis (p’s &gt; .001).

Discussion:

Findings suggest TBI history, regardless of demographic factors, APOE ε4 alleles, or cognitive diagnosis, does not alter the course of neurocognitive functioning later-in-life in older adults with or without cognitive impairment. Future clinicopathological longitudinal studies that well characterize head-injuries and the associated clinical course are needed to help clarify the mechanism in which TBI may increase dementia risk.

pmcIntroduction

History of traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly moderate to severe TBI, has been associated with later-in-life cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia in a number of large clinical studies (e.g., Barnes et al., 2018; Nordstrom &amp; Nordstrom, 2018; Schneider et al., 2021). The mechanism by which TBI may increase risk of dementia later-in-life is currently unknown, though there are three main hypotheses that include 1) TBI initiating a neurodegenerative process through metabolic cascades and/or inflammation (Bigler, 2013), 2) TBI lowering cognitive/cerebral reserve to result in increased risk (LoBue et al., 2018), or 3) a combination of the two, wherein TBI accelerates the aging process through neuropathological changes to increase risk.

Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that TBI may induce a neurodegenerative process after moderate to severe TBI as reflected by reduced quantitative gray and white-matter volumes post-TBI in longitudinal follow-up between 1 and 9 years after injury (Macruz et al., 2022; Simeone et al., 2022; Tomaiuolo et al., 2021). However, whether a single mild TBI could initiate a neurodegenerative process in some individuals is less clear, with only some evidence of gray matter volume loss in small samples in short follow-ups (da Costa et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2013). Neuropathological investigations offer support that TBI could lead to depositions of neuropathological proteins. For example, in those with a single moderate to severe to TBI, post-mortem evaluation has suggested that widespread neurofibrillary tau tangles and amyloid-beta deposits were present in up to one-third of long-term survivors 1 to 47 years post-injury (Johnson et al., 2012). Similar analyses of large databases, including the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset, have resulted in less clear and some outright contradictory findings (Sugarman et al., 2019; Crane et al., 2016; Agrawal et al., 2022). Regardless, while neuropathological deposition may be evidence that TBI triggers a neurodegenerative process, it is possible that these reflect a single static deposition of proteins that lead to reduced neuronal reserve, thereby increasing dementia risk with aging. Alternatively, TBI may instead increase dementia risk by simply lowering cognitive reserve and hastening onset of cognitive impairment. Evidence of hastened onset of neurocognitive disorders after TBI has been observed in the NACC dataset (LoBue, Denney, et al., 2016; LoBue, Wadsworth, et al., 2016; LoBue, Wilmoth, et al., 2016; Schaffert et al., 2018). Overall, a clear mechanism has yet to be determined, and investigating the impact of a TBI that occurred decades prior is challenging from a research design standpoint, as many years of longitudinal follow-up with in-vivo biomarkers are needed to more clearly address this question. In addition, it is not clear if certain subgroups may be at increased risk, as several variables have been identified thus far that may interact with TBI to moderate or mediate the risk of later-in-life cognitive decline, including severity of injury, demographics, genetics, and other clinical factors.

There is some evidence that TBI may interact with age, race, sex, and education to attenuate or moderate risk of dementia later-in-life. In 2014, Gardner and colleagues found that even a mild TBI sustained at an older age (65+) resulted in greater risk of incident dementia compared to a younger age of injury (Gardner et al., 2014). In the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, risk of dementia was higher in female (HR=1.69) compared to male participants (HR=1.15), and in White (HR=1.55) compared to Black participants (HR=1.22) (Schneider et al., 2021). Some evidence suggests that cognitive reserve and/or education (a proxy commonly used to measure cognitive reserve) may attenuate risk, with higher risk being seen in those with lower premorbid intelligence (Raymont et al., 2008). However, a more recent investigation examined over 600,000 Danish men and actually found a slightly stronger relationship between TBI and dementia in those with higher levels of cognitive abilities and education level, which argues against a cognitive-reserve hypothesis being protective (Osler et al., 2020.) Overall, the literature on demographic factors interacting with TBI is limited, and it is unclear which demographic groups may be at increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment following a TBI.

In addition to demographic factors, there is some evidence suggesting a link between apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 polymorphism and TBI outcomes. A recently published meta-analysis of 14 studies in 2021 found more favorable disability outcomes following TBI in those without APOE ε4 alleles (McFadyen et al., 2021). However, the authors also found conflicting findings in regards to whether APOE ε4 increases risk of worsening neuropsychological functioning 6 months to 2 years following TBI. While there are some data that suggests a higher prevalence of dementia in those with TBI and APOE ε4 alleles compared to those with TBI and no APOE ε4 alleles, there is no clear evidence that suggests a clear moderating relationship between TBI and APOE ε4 polymorphism on long-term neurocognitive outcomes (McFadyen et al., 2021).

Many of the aforementioned investigations were designed to explore long-term outcomes following TBI, including risk of cognitive impairment or dementia. There are fewer studies evaluating whether TBI may accelerate neurocognitive decline later-in-life. One of the most pertinent investigations in this regard was conducted by Tripodis et al. in 2017. They evaluated 764 individuals in the NACC database, who either had normal cognition (n=462) or probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD; n=274). Those with a history of TBI and loss of consciousness (LOC) were matched demographically within NACC to those without a history of TBI and LOC. Over approximately three years, mixed-linear models did not detect statistically significant differences in rates of neuropsychological change in those with and without a history of TBI in either normally aging individuals or those with suspected Alzheimer’s disease (Tripodis et al., 2017). While this was a well-designed investigation, there were several limitations, including a relatively small sample size, short follow-up, and lack of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnoses. Additionally, the authors did not evaluate for the interaction of TBI history and sex, education, race/ethnicity, or age on rates of change, which could be important moderators of the potential relationship, as shown in prior studies investigating risk of dementia after TBI (Gardner et al., 2014; Osler et al., 2020; Raymont et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2021).

The current investigation sought to fill an important gap in the literature by investigating whether TBI history accelerated the rate of neurocognitive change later in life, and the potential interactions between demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education), APOE ε4 status, and cognitive diagnosis (i.e., normal cognition, MCI, or dementia). We also hoped to address some of the limitations of prior studies by using a larger sample size, performing more sensitivity analyses, and increasing the length of the study follow-up, which is critical to determining longitudinal risk. We felt that the addition of these analyses is important to understand the broader context of risk of dementia after sustaining a TBI and may help determine if certain individuals are at higher risk of neurocognitive decline following TBI.

Method

Participants

Participants were obtained from the NACC database. NACC is a collective database established by the National Institute of Aging and collects data from 37 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) across the United States. In 2005, ADRCs began depositing clinical data from research participants to a central repository, called the Uniform Data Set (UDS), which is now in the third version. Data are freely available to researchers from NACC, and the recruitment parameters and population of the database have been described in detail and can be found on their website (https://naccdata.org/). In brief, each center enrolls participants based on their own protocol, with various recruitments efforts from self-referral, clinical referrals, or community organizations, etc. In general, neurological and neuropsychological evaluations are performed an approximately annual basis at the various ADRC sites. For this study, the full database was requested from NACC, which contains over 45,000 participants collected up until their 01/2022 data freeze. Participants were included if they were at least 50 years of age, had neuropsychological data for at least three visits, and whose TBI history was known. Individuals were assigned to two primary groups using case-control matching as described below.

Case-Control Participant Matching

Participants were placed in the TBI group if they had a self- or informant-reported history of TBI, which could include LOC or no LOC (defined by the variable NACCTBI). Due to the NACC data collection procedures, individuals were only asked if they sustained a TBI with LOC (&lt; 5 minutes or ≥ 5 minutes) prior to 2015 (versions 1 and 2 of the UDS). After initiation of UDS version 3, TBI variables were expanded to include a new variable on TBI without LOC. Because of this, we performed sensitivity analyses as to length of LOC, but because these collection procedures differed between versions, we used the aggregate NACCTBI variable to define history of TBI in the main analyses.

Because of the large sample available in NACC, we were able to precisely match those with a history of TBI (TBI+) to those without a history of TBI (TBI−). Those with TBI+ and who met inclusion criteria (n = 1467) were matched one-to-one to those with TBI− (n=1467) using the additional ~45,000 participants available in NACC with no history of TBI. The Case-Control Matching procedure in SPSS was used to match TBI+ participants to TBI− participants with the following parameters: number of visits (at least 3 but up to 6 visits), age (+/− 2 years), sex, education (years), race (Caucasian, African-American, Asian, or Multiracial), Hispanic ethnicity (Yes/No), primary language, number of APOE ε4 alleles (0, 1, or 2), global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3), cognitive status (Normal Cognition, impaired but not MCI, MCI and type [amnestic single domain, amnestic multidomain, non-amnestic single domain, non-amnestic multidomain], or dementia), and clinical etiology of cognitive impairment (AD, Lewy body disease, behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia, or other dementia). All matching data were taken from the first NACC visit.

Assessment Measures

Neuropsychological measures were used across UDS Version 2 and 3. In NACC, some UDS version 2 measures were replaced with similar versions of the measures in UDS Version 3 (e.g., Logical Memory for Craft Story), with moderate to strong correlations between the updated measures (Monsell et al., 2016). In order to allow for comparisons across the versions, we elected to create composite indices for domains of neuropsychological functioning. For UDS version 2, an executive functioning/attention/processing speed (EFAS) composite score was created by taking the mean normative performance using NACC Norms (Weintraub et al., 2009) of digit span forward and backward trials, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Coding, and Trail Making Test (TMT) A &amp; B. A language composite was created by using an average normative performance of Animal fluency, Vegetable fluency, and the Boston Naming Test-30 item (BNT-30). Finally, a memory composite was created by average normative performance on Logical Memory Story A Immediate and Delayed Recall trials. For participants with UDS Version 3 test batteries, WAIS-R Coding was no longer used, the Multilingual Naming Test (MINT) replaced the BNT-30, phonemic fluency (total F- and L-words) was added to the language composite, Number Span replaced Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) Digit Span, the Craft Story replaced WMS-R Logical Memory, and the delayed recall of the Benson Complex Figure was added to the memory composite. A description of the UDS NACC batteries and neuropsychological testing procedures can be found on the NACC website (https://naccdata.org/data-collection/forms-documentation/uds-3). All participants were required to have at least two measures within each of the domains (to create a composite) to be eligible for inclusion in the analyses.

Statistical Analyses

Simple descriptive and frequency statistics were used to first evaluate if the case-control matching procedure was accurate.

Mixed-effects random intercept models with AR1 covariance structure were used to evaluate the impact that TBI has on neuropsychological functioning (main effects) and the impact that TBI history has on EFAS, language, and memory composite scores over time (interactions). Separate mixed linear models measured the interaction between TBI, age at time of visit (defined as a three level variable, 50-64, 65-74, and 75+), education (defined as high School or less, some college, bachelor’s degree, or graduate degree), sex (male or female), race/ethnicity (which was collapsed to Non-Hispanic White vs. other due to sample size), baseline cognitive diagnosis (normal aging, MCI, or dementia), APOE ε4 status (no APOE ε4alleles, 1 APOE ε4 allele, or 2 APOE ε4 alleles). While main effects are reported, the interaction terms between TBI history and these variables over time were our targeted findings of interest.

Apart from these main analyses, three additional models were also constructed to help clarify our findings. The first was to evaluate the impact of the length of LOC after TBI (&lt; 5 minutes, ≥ 5 minutes, or no LOC) on longitudinal neuropsychological performance. The second involved removing APOE ε2 allele carriers in the APOE ε4 models, as APOE ε2 is a known protective factor for cognitive decline. This analysis was specifically carried out to see if APOE ε2 was abating a statistically significant effect. The last involved evaluating for a significant interaction between age at time of visit, baseline cognitive diagnosis, and time. In other words, this analysis aimed to evaluate if older individuals with cognitive impairment and a history of TBI had more rapid cognitive decline over time compared to younger individuals with cognitive impairment.

Due to the number of analyses conducted, the large sample sizes, and the powerful models used, the p-value was set at &lt; .001 for significance to reduce the chances of type-1 error. A p-value &lt; .001 was specifically chosen due to high number of p-values obtained for this manuscript (main effects plus interaction terms approached 120 p-values). All of the models were plotted and visually inspected (provided in supplementary materials) to assess the clinical significance of any statistically significant results. Missing data were excluded listwise for each individual model. Missing data for neuropsychological composites was minimal and varied by analyses. Baseline sample sizes are depicted in each Table and Figure, including the supplemental materials.

Results

Sample Characteristics

Sample characteristics depicting demographics and neuropsychological data can be found in Table 1, with nearly identical matching statistics on all independent variables assessed.

Main Effects and Longitudinal Impact of TBI History on Neuropsychological Functioning

Mixed linear model main effects and longitudinal impact of TBI history on neuropsychological functioning can be found in Table 2. Figures 1, 2, and 3 also depict the estimated marginal means (EMM) and standard errors (SE). TBI did not have a significant main effect on EFAS, language, or memory functioning (all p’s &gt; .110) or an interaction over time (all p’s &gt; .133). A main effect of time was observed for EFAS (p &lt; .001) and language (p &lt; .001) composites, where scores tended to decrease over time. When evaluating the interaction between time and TBI with less than 5 minutes LOC, more than 5 minutes of LOC, and no LOC, there were no statistically significant results in our mixed linear models, which are depicted in Table 3 (all p’s &gt; .054; Supplementary Figures 1 - 9).

Demographics by TBI History Interactions on Longitudinal Neuropsychological Functioning

All longitudinal demographic by TBI history model interactions can be found in Table 4. There was not a significant interaction of age and TBI history on EFAS composite scores over time. There was a significant interaction of age and TBI history on language and memory composite scores over time. A visual inspection of these effects can be found in figures 4, 5, and 6, which depict the estimated marginal means and associated standard errors of all three composites over time. While the memory and language models reached statistically significant results in this 3-way interaction, visual inspection provided little evidence that a history of TBI was associated with reduced neurocognitive functioning over time in either older or younger individuals. This was confirmed by post-hoc analyses, in which interactions between history of TBI and time were evaluated separately in each age group (i.e., 55-64; 65-75, 76+). Results suggested that history of TBI did not reach a significant interaction with time in EFAS for the younger age group (F [5, 971.75] = 1.447, p = .205), the middle age group (F [5, 2839.96] = 1.873, p = .096), or the older age group (F [5, 1940.87] = 1.105, p = .356). No significant interactions between TBI and time were seen for language performance in the younger age group (F [5, 1055.19] = 0.621, p = .684), middle age group (F [5, 2811.21] = 2.480, p = .030), and older age group (F [5, 1872.18] = 0.461, p = .805). No significant interactions were observed between TBI and time were seen for memory performance in the younger age group (F [5, 1245.40] = 1.884, p = .094), middle age group (F [5, 3.233.29] = 2.528, p = .027), and older age group (F [5, 2096.27] = 1.566, p = .166). There were no significant interactions between educational background and TBI history on EFAS, language, or memory composite scores over time (all p’s &gt; .404; Table 4; Supplementary Figures 10 - 12). No significant interactions were observed between sex and TBI history on EFAS, language, or memory composite scores over time (all p’s &gt; .240; Table 4; Supplementary Figures 13 - 15). Similarly, there were no significant interactions between race/ethnicity and TBI history on EFAS, language, or memory composite scores over time (all p’s &gt; .188; Table 4; Supplementary Figures 16 - 18). In addition to the lack of statistically significant effects, visual inspection of all models did not reveal clinically meaningful differences in Z-scores over time.

APOE ε4 Status by TBI History Interactions on Longitudinal Neuropsychological Functioning

There were no significant interactions between APOE ε4 status and TBI history on EFAS, language or memory, composite scores over time (all p’s &gt; .027; Table 5; Supplementary Figures 19 - 21). After removing APOE ε2 carriers from the analyses (n = 368), there were still no significant interactions observed between APOE ε4 status and TBI history on any of the three composite scores over time (all p’s &gt; .037; Table 5; Supplementary Figures 22 - 24).

Cognitive Diagnoses by TBI History Interactions on Longitudinal Neuropsychological Functioning

There were no significant interactions between cognitive diagnoses and TBI history on EFAS, language, or memory composite scores over time (all p’s &gt; .001; Table 6; Supplementary Figures 25 - 27).

Age by TBI History by Cognitive Diagnoses Interactions on Longitudinal Neuropsychological Functioning

Longitudinal impact of age by TBI history model interactions, stratified by cognitive diagnoses, can be found in Table 6. When looking at only cognitively normal individuals, there was a statistically significant effect of age and TBI history on EFAS, language, and memory functioning over time. However, like the previous results reported, visual analysis (Supplementary Figures 28 - 30) of the data did not suggest that history of TBI was associated with increased rate of decline in these individuals. Maximum differences between the groups within their age brackets at any time point were minimal, approximately a 0.2 Z-score, which is not clinically significant. There were no significant interactions between age and TBI history on EFAS, language, or memory composite scores over time in individuals with MCI or dementia (all p’s &gt; .003; Table 6; Supplementary Figures 31 - 36). However, like the other findings, TBI did not appear to have a clinically meaningful effect, as this appeared to be due to the last visit separation of TBI+ individuals over 76 years old having a 0.62 Z better performance than the remainder of the groups.

Discussion

The current investigation aimed to evaluate the impact that TBI may have on rate of cognitive decline in aging, with a particular emphasis on the possibility that TBI may interact with various demographic factors, cognitive diagnosis, APOE ε4 status, and/or length of LOC to hasten impairment. Despite a large carefully matched sample (totaling ~2,800 individuals), individuals, powerful analyses, and rich neuropsychological data, the vast majority of our findings showed no significant associations. While some models yielded statistically significant results, visual inspection and post-hoc analyses revealed no convincing evidence that TBI relates to an accelerated course of cognitive decline or interacts with the available potential variables to worsen cognition over time. As such, our findings suggest that TBI does not appear to hasten neurocognitive decline over time in cognitively normal individuals or in individuals with MCI or dementia. Furthermore, we did not find any significant interactions between TBI and neuropsychological change in those who were older, had more or less education, were male or female, or identified as a racial/ethnic minority, or had APOE ε4 alleles.

Several prior investigations have identified some demographic factors, that when combined with a history of TBI, may increase risk for later development of dementia. These factors have included older age (Gardner et al., 2014), female sex (Nuno et al., 2020), male sex (Fleminger et al., 2003), lower cognitive ability in young adulthood (Osler et al., 2017, 2020), higher levels of cognitive abilities (Osler et al., 2020), and interactions between age and sex (Eramudugolla et al., 2014). Thus, the literature is mixed, with some outright contrary findings. While it is possible that a history of TBI may reduce cognitive reserve and increase risk of dementia in certain demographic groups, these groups are not clearly defined in the current literature. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the course of cognitive change over time is not altered by having a history of TBI, and does not vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, or educational status. This may indicate that TBI increases risk of dementia by reducing cognitive or neuronal reserve (e.g., perhaps by increased deposition of neuropathological proteins and/or inflammatory processes), rather than initiating a neurodegenerative process per se. However, further long-term longitudinal work with both cognitive and biological markers will need to be completed to better understand this relationship, with additional attention to sociocultural and demographic variables that may mediate or moderate dementia risk and symptom onset in different subgroups.

In our analyses, APOE ε4 allele carriers with a history of TBI did not present with more significant cognitive decline in measures of EFAS, language, and memory than those without TBI. These findings remained similar even after ε2 allele carriers were excluded. One systematic review showed that out of 18 studies that examined neuropsychological outcomes, APOE ε4 allele was reported to confer worse cognitive outcome in only seven (36.8%), while non-contributory in nine (52.9%) and protective in two (10.5%) (Lawrence et al., 2015). However, only a smaller number of studies have consistently focused on how APOE ε4 may interact with chronic impact (&gt; 1 year since TBI) on cognitive performance (Ashman et al., 2008; Hodgkinson et al., 2009; Isoniemi at al., 2006; Merritt et al., 2018; Sundström et al., 2004; Teasdale at al., 2000), still with conflicting results. Although many factors (e.g., mechanism of TBI, time to follow up since TBI, patient demographics, etc.) may explain this variability, it has been highlighted that higher incidence of dementia among APOE ε4 allele carriers may confound neuropsychological outcomes (Isoniemi et al., 2006; McFadyen et al., 2021; Sundström et al., 2004, 2007). Our analysis controlled for this factor by comparing patients within each diagnosis domain (cognitively normal, MCI, dementia). A recent community-based study provides some neuropathological evidence showing that APOE ε4 did not contribute to neurodegenerative and vascular changes on autopsy (Agrawal et al., 2022). Overall, our findings based on a large nation-wide cohort suggest that APOE ε4 status does not interact with TBI history to influence long-term cognitive outcomes.

Overall, the present study suggests that a history of TBI does not significantly alter the course of neurocognitive functioning later-in-life, regardless of many demographic factors, length of LOC, APOE ε4 status, or cognitive diagnosis. First, as with any investigation using the NACC database, the information on TBI history is limited, and data are presently limited in terms of additional TBI characteristics that may moderate this relationship (e.g., timing of TBI, number of TBIs, or severity markers such as posttraumatic amnesia or LOC duration). Second, while we attempted to break down groups by various demographic factors, NACC is predominantly a White, well-educated sample, and we lacked the power to divide groups further into specific racial and ethnic identities. Lastly, cognitive composite scores were used to help reduce the number of analyses, but for a subsample, some neuropsychological measures changed over UDS versions. Significant variability in composites over time was not apparent, but it is possible this could have theoretically impacted findings.

Overall, the current study suggests that a history of TBI, regardless of many demographic factors, length of LOC, APOE ε4 status, or cognitive diagnosis does not significantly alter the course of neurocognitive functioning later-in-life. Future clinicopathological longitudinal studies that well characterize the nature of an individual’s head-injury and the associated clinical course are needed to help clarify the mechanism in which TBI may increase dementia risk.

Key Points

Question:

We sought to answer whether a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerated cognitive decline later-in-life in those with and without cognitive impairment (i.e., mild cognitive impairment or dementia).

Findings:

Our findings did not suggest that a history of TBI altered the course of neurocognitive functioning over approximately 6 years, and it did not appear to significantly interact with demographics (age, sex, education, race), Apolipoprotein ε4 status or cognitive diagnosis to increase risk in these subgroups.

Importance:

Overall, we conclude that a history of TBI does not appear to alter the course of neurocognitive functioning later-in-life, and this does not appear to be the mechanism in which TBI may increase risk of dementia for some individuals.

Next Steps:

As a field, we need longitudinal neurocognitive and biomarker studies with well-characterized head injury data to clarify the mechanism in which TBI may increase dementia risk.
