Purpose:

To determine the incidence of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) among patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG).

Patients and Methods:

Retrospective, population-based cohort study. All residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (≥40 years) who were diagnosed with OAG between January 1, 1965, to December 31, 2000, were eligible for inclusion in this study. A total of 509 patients were included over the 36-year period. The cumulative probability of developing dementia was calculated and compared with the population risk of dementia.

Results:

Of the 509 patients included, 300 (58.9%) were female, the median age was 67.5 years, and 278 patients (54.6%) had primary OAG. Other subgroups were pseudoexfoliation in 15.1%, treated ocular hypertension in 14.1%, normal tension glaucoma in 10.6%, and pigmentary glaucoma in 5.5% of the patients. Respectively, 118 (23.0%) and 99 (19.4%) patients developed dementia and AD. The 10-year cumulative probability of developing dementia and AD was 12.0% and 9.9%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 9.3–15.3% and 7.5–13%, respectively. The observed 10-year incidence of dementia and AD were significantly lower than the expected population incidence (19.0% and 19.0%; P&lt;0.001). Older age at diagnosis of glaucoma was a strong predictor for the development of dementia by multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio (HR) 3.31, 95% CI 2.61–4.20, P&lt;0.001).

Conclusion:

The risk of developing dementia or AD was decreased in OAG patients compared with the general population. OAG with onset at a later age may present as a different etio-pathogenetic entity compared to onset at a younger age, representing the optic nerve findings of generalized neurodegenerative processes.

Precis:

In this population-based study of 509 open-angle glaucoma patients over a 36-year period, we identified a decreased rate of developing dementia compared to the rate in the general population.

Introduction

Epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of dementia in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and vice-versa.1–8 Both diseases are neurodegenerative affecting the aging population with distinct areas of pathogenetic overlap.9 Studies in patients with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have reported thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), loss of retinal ganglion cells, and increased cupping of the optic nerve head, which are well-established markers of glaucomatous progression.10–18 As well, studies have found decreased β-amyloid (1–42) and increased tau protein, biomolecules characteristic of AD, in the eyes of patients with OAG.17,19–21 While there are biomolecular and structural similarities, the relationship between the two diseases is still poorly understood. Also, several epidemiological studies have found contradictory results, reporting that glaucoma may be a protective risk factor towards dementia and vice-versa.22–26

The purpose of our study was to compare the risk of developing dementia and AD in patients newly diagnosed with OAG in Olmsted County, Minnesota, within the general population.

Methods

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Mayo Clinic. All data collection was conducted in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Data Collection

This is a population-based retrospective cohort study of all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who were diagnosed with OAG from January 1, 1965 through December 31, 2000, utilizing the Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP). The REP is a surveillance and medical records linkage system which was established to study the occurrence and history of disease among residents of Olmsted County.27

The county is relatively isolated from other urban centers and essentially all medical care to residents is provided by the Mayo Clinic and its affiliated hospitals — St. Mary’s Hospital and Rochester Methodist Hospital —or by the Olmsted Medical Group and its affiliated hospital, the Olmsted Community Hospital. All medical information on each resident including clinical and pathologic diagnoses, surgical procedures, and laboratory results is linked under the REP system. For consenting patients, these records may be retrieved for population-based studies.

Data from a prior study examining glaucoma incidence and blindness in Olmsted County residents was utilized to identify patients with OAG including primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal tension glaucoma (NTG), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, pigmentary glaucoma and treated ocular hypertension (OHT).28 We chose to include treated OHT patients since our study spanned from 1965 to 2000, and during the earlier years it is likely that some patients were categorized as pre-perimetric OHT due to prevailing definitions of glaucoma at the time. Excluding those OHT patients who were treated with ocular hypotensive medications would have created a bias due to the changing definitions of glaucoma over the period. We excluded patients diagnosed with other secondary causes of OAG and with angle closure glaucoma. Incomplete charts and patients with dates of diagnosis outside the defined study period were also excluded. We reviewed the medical records until the diagnosis of dementia, or death.

Demographic data including age, sex, education level, and occupation were noted during the review. We abstracted date of onset of symptoms, date of diagnosis, type of dementia, highest level of education achieved, history of symptoms, results of exam, neuroimaging findings, and treatment given. Co-morbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, history of cerebrovascular accident, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, tobacco and alcohol use, and obesity were also recorded.

Diagnostic Criteria for Glaucoma

In this study, OAG was defined according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern criteria as the presence of an open angle along with the presence of one or both of the following characteristics: (1) optic nerve damage consistent with glaucoma (diffuse thinning, focal narrowing, or notching of the optic disc rim; documented progression of cupping of the optic disc; diffuse or localized abnormalities of the peripapillary RNFL, disc rim, or peripapillary RNFL hemorrhages; or optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the 2 eyes); (2) visual field (VF) damage consistent with RNFL damage (nasal step, arcuate field defect, or paracentral depression in clusters of test sites).29,30 This included the following subtypes: Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG): OAG, secondary causes excluded

Normal tension glaucoma (NTG): OAG with normal intraocular pressure (IOP)

Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma: glaucoma with observed pseudoexfoliation material on anterior segment structures

Pigmentary: glaucoma with observed iris pigment dispersion throughout the eye

Treated OHT: patients who were treated with ocular hypotensive medications due to increased IOP without evidence of optic disc damage or visual field defects at diagnosis.

Diagnostic Criteria for Dementia and AD

Dementia was diagnosed based on the DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder when there was a decline in neurocognitive function that interfered with independence31. All patients with AD formed a subset of patients with dementia. The medical records were reviewed to establish gradual progression of the disease, and to exclude other neurological, mental, or systemic disorders or conditions that may have contributed to cognitive decline. Patients with a code of dementia but without documentation of decline from a previous level of performance in cognitive domains (learning and memory, language, executive function, complex attention, perceptual-motor, and social cognition) were not diagnosed with dementia. Patients were then categorized into the different subtypes of neurocognitive disorders. Patients diagnosed with a major neurocognitive disorder and other causes of dementia such as vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia and Huntington disease were excluded. Patients were diagnosed with AD when they fulfilled certain pre-determined diagnostic criteria.31 A random selection of 20 patients diagnosed with dementia were further subjected to review by a behavioral neurologist (RS) to confirm the application of uniform diagnostic criteria. RS found an agreement of 95% (95% confidence interval (CI) 75–100%) for the diagnosis of dementia and an agreement of 90% (95% CI 68–99%) for the diagnosis of AD, confirming our diagnostic criteria.

Data Analysis

The cumulative risk of developing dementia and AD was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods.32 Potential risk factors for dementia and AD were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models. Using data collected from previous epidemiological studies performed in Olmsted County, the age- and sex-specific incidence rates of dementia and AD in the population were estimated.28,33 A 1-sample log-rank test was used to compare the observed probability of dementia and AD in the OAG cohort to the expected probability in the population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, general population. The cumulative risk of developing dementia was also calculated for the 5 subtypes of glaucoma (POAG, NTG, pseudoexfoliation, pigmentary and treated OHT) and compared with the observed probability of dementia and AD in the population of Olmsted County.

Results

Patient Demographics

Of the potential 548 OAG patients residing in Olmsted County, 26 had no prior authorization for statistical analysis for use in the study, 7 were excluded due to other secondary glaucoma, and 6 were diagnosed with dementia prior to onset of glaucoma. The remaining 509 patients were included in the study. Median age was 67.5 years (range: 25.2 – 101.6 years), 300 (58.9%) were female and 478 (98%) self-reported their race as white. The average age at diagnosis of OAG for patients developing dementia was 74.9 years compared to 65.0 years for those not developing dementia. The types of OAG included were POAG in 278 (54.6%), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma in 77 (15.1%), treated OHT in 72 (14.1%), NTG in 54 (10.6%), and pigmentary in 28 (5.5%). Of the 509 patients included in the study, 118 (23%) developed dementia, of which 99 (84%) were diagnosed with AD, 11 (9%) with vascular dementia and 4 (3%) with combined vascular and AD. The median time to the onset of AD was 122.8 months (range, 4.9–364.7 months). Demographics, types of glaucoma, co-morbidities and social history are summarized for the two cohorts (patients who developed and did not develop dementia) in Table 1.

Risk of dementia

The 10- and 20-year cumulative probability of developing dementia was 12% (95% CI 9.3–15.3%) and 27% (95% CI 22.7–32%). (Figure 1a) The 10- and 20-year cumulative probability of developing Alzheimer dementia was 9.9% (95% CI 7.5–13%) and 22.5% (95% CI 18.5–27.3%). Figure (1b) In the POAG subgroup, the 10 and 20 year cumulative probability of developing dementia was 10.5% (95% CI 7.4–15.1%) and 22.9% (95% CI 17.8–29.4%), while the 10 and 20 year cumulative probability of developing Alzheimer dementia was 9.8% (95% CI 6.7–14.2%) and 21.1% (95% CI 16.2–27.5%).

Risk factors for dementia

Univariate analysis for progression to dementia and AD is reported in Table 2. Patients with OAG diagnosed at an older age had a greater risk of developing dementia or AD than those diagnosed at a younger age (Hazard Ratio (HR) 3.24 per decade of age, P&lt;0.001, HR 3.47, P&lt;0.001). Female sex was also a significant predictor of both dementia and AD (HR 1.99, P=0.002, HR 1.96, P=0.005). Race was not found to be a significant contributor to the development of either dementia or AD. Primary and secondary education level as the highest level of education achieved was a significant predictor for development of dementia (HR 4.10, P&lt;0.001 and HR 3.06, P&lt;0.001, respectively) and AD (HR 4.18, P&lt;0.001, HR 3.39, P&lt;0.001). Higher years of education was significantly protective for development of dementia and AD (HR 0.87, P&lt;0.001, HR 0.87, P&lt;0.001). Hyperlipidemia and obesity were found to be significant protective co-morbidities in dementia (HR 0.50, P&lt;0.001, HR 0.44, P=0.01) and AD (HR 0.47, P&lt;0.001, HR 0.44, P=0.02). Type 2 diabetes mellitus was protective in AD (HR 0.55, P=0.03), with tendency towards protection for dementia (HR 0.67, P=0.09). History of stroke and head injury were significant predictors for the development of dementia (HR 2.03, P&lt;0.001, HR 2.62, P=0.004). A history of head injury was found to be a significant predictor of AD (HR 2.89, P=0.003).

Multivariate analysis showed that later age at diagnosis was found to be a significant predictor for dementia (HR 3.31, P&lt;0.001) and AD (HR 3.57, P&lt;0.001). Head injury was also a predictor for dementia (HR 1.98, P=0.04) and AD (HR 2.11, P=0.03). Hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were not protective or predictive factors, and hypertension was the only factor that remained protective for dementia (HR 0.40, P&lt;0.001) and AD (HR 0.49, P=0.002). Complete multivariate analysis is found in Table 3.

We compared mortality in the two groups using dementia as a time dependent covariate in the model and found that an increase in the development of dementia was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 7.98, P&lt;0.001).

Comparison of dementia risk between patients with OAG and the Olmsted County general population

The rate of dementia among patients with OAG (10-year rate 13.0%) was significantly less (P&lt;0.001) than the rate of dementia for the Olmsted County general population (10-year rate 19.0%). (Figure 2a) Similarly, the rate of AD among patients with OAG (10- year rate 9.9%) was significantly less (P&lt;0.001) than the rate of AD for the Olmsted County general population (10-year rate 19.0%). (Figure 2b) The rates of dementia and AD among the subtypes of glaucoma (POAG, normal tension, pseudoexfoliation and pigmentary) was similar and less than that of the general population.

Risk of dementia in the subgroups of glaucoma compared with the Olmsted County general population

The rate of dementia and AD among patients with POAG (10-year rate 12.0 and 11.0%, respectively) was significantly less (P&lt;0.001) than the rates for the Olmsted County general population. We found that excluding the treated OHT group yielded similar 10-year incidence rates of dementia and AD, which were still significantly lower than expected population incidence (12.0% and 21.0%, P&lt;0.001).The treated OHT subgroup also had significantly lower risk of dementia and AD than expected (10-year rate 6.0% and 6.0% respectively, P=0.02). There was no difference in observed and expected dementia and AD rates among patients with NTG and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma. No patients with pigmentary glaucoma developed dementia. The incidence rates among the sub-groups are depicted in Table 4 and Figure 3.

Discussion

Our study indicates that open angle glaucoma patients have a lower risk of developing AD than the general population in Olmsted County, MN, as determined from a previous study by Rocca et al.33 Comorbid and various health risk factors known to be associated with glaucoma were not statistical predictors for the development of AD. Rather, the typical clinical predictors of AD, including level and years of education, history of stroke, and past head injury, were significant indicators of disease risk. Additionally, the rates of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia in the subtypes of glaucoma (i.e. POAG, normal tension, pseudoexfoliation, and pigmentary) were relatively equal and lower than that of the general population. Interestingly, older age of onset of OAG was found to be a strong predictor for development of dementia.

Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed surprising findings in our data that must be elaborated in the context of the association between glaucoma and AD. Univariate analysis indicated that hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity were significantly protective of dementia or AD. These comorbidities are commonly associated with poor health outcomes and are not expected to be protective. Additionally, we found that dementia was not associated with a higher mortality, and thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that a shorter lifespan, due to the comorbidities, in patients with dementia or AD as an explanation for these unexpected findings.

Multivariate analysis narrowed these protective risk factors to only hypertension, indicating a co-dependence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. The reason for a decreased risk of dementia or AD with hypertension remains unclear. Patients with OAG diagnosed at an older age had approximately a 3.5 times greater chance of developing dementia compared with patients diagnosed with OAG at a younger age (Table 3). This suggests that although phenotypically comparable, OAG with later onset likely represents a different etio-pathogenetic entity. Optic nerve head changes in this cohort are possibly occurring as part of more generalized neurodegenerative processes which later clinically manifests as dementia or AD.34 This would be consistent with the finding of “senile sclerotic” discs in older OAG patients, compared with the steeply excavated discs of younger OAG patients.35–37

In addition to this discussion of the co-morbid risk factors, it is also important to describe our demographic risk factors in accordance with the overall literature. We found that females had a significantly elevated risk of developing dementia and AD. A similar association was found in another large-scale, population-based study. This study looked at patients with dementia and found a higher odds ratio for prior diagnosis of OAG in females but no statistical difference in males when compared to controls.6 The authors of this study attributed the increased risk of developing OAG in females to a decline in female sex hormones, which have been associated with a multitude of factors involved in glaucomatous progression.6,38 It is generally accepted that more females develop dementia than males, but a clinical or physiological association has not been confirmed. Sex hormones may thus be an important, or at least relevant, factor in the progression of both diseases.

This study’s findings on the association between glaucoma and dementia are consistent with the study by Ou et al., the only other study of similar scale to have been conducted in the United States. They similarly found a decreased rate of Alzheimer’s dementia and other dementia in glaucoma patients.23 However, in that study, diagnosis was based on the 5% sample of Medicare claims data which utilizes ICD-9 codes, while our current study utilized a population-based cohort with a systematic review of individual patient charts. By reviewing and abstracting each chart to ensure that all included patients met diagnostic criteria for both glaucoma and dementia, our data is likely to be more clinically reliable than database analyses that can be subject to diagnostic coding errors. Despite these differences, our study and that of Ou et al. produced similar results.

Other studies investigating the relationship between glaucoma and dementia patients have been conducted outside of the United States and have also found no significant association between these diseases.22–26 Many of these international studies have utilized ICD-9 and −10 codes in diagnosing OAG, dementia, and AD, and therefore have similar limitations to the study by Ou et al.24–26 However, a study by Ekstrom et al. utilized a similar methodology as our study, including their assessment of dementia through review of records over the 30-year follow up period to ensure true positive diagnoses. The group found that pseudoexfoliation and newly diagnosed OAG did not increase the risk of developing AD.22

Other studies have reported a positive association between AD and glaucoma.1–8 These studies have generally found increased structural and visual field progression indicative of glaucoma in the eyes of dementia patients, without elevated IOP. A study conducted in Taiwan by Lin et al utilizing ICD-9 codes and prescriptions from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database claims data found that POAG was a significant predictor for AD.8 However, the utilization of claims data is subject to selection bias as POAG patients may have more frequent contact with healthcare providers, resulting in a greater likelihood of dementia diagnosis, but not necessarily a greater risk for developing the disease. As well, the severity of their dementia cannot be determined by ICD codes, and a diagnosis of dementia may be recorded for patients who do not meet the required diagnostic criteria. In contrast, our study attempted to correct this limitation through comprehensive diagnostic criteria created in conjunction with a Neurologist at the Mayo Clinic based upon a review of individual patient records and abstractions of relevant information.

Our study addressed the question of whether glaucoma patients have a greater risk of dementia compared with the general population, and our results indicate that this is not the case. However, it did not address whether dementia patients may have an increased risk of glaucoma. If there are common pathophysiologic mechanisms between the two diseases, it would be reasonable to expect that the presence of one disease confers increased risk of the other disease. The literature has well established that a significant number of AD patients show glaucomatous changes and progression in respect to visual field tests and structural characteristics, specifically in the RNFL and optic nerve head.9–18 However, it is possible that disease processes in glaucoma represent a localized phenomenon as the eye is an immune-privileged site. Therefore, it may still be possible that dementia patients who have a more generalized CNS disease are at greater risk for glaucoma, or glaucoma-like changes, even if the converse is not the case. Future population-based research will be required to properly address this question.

This study was limited by its retrospective nature. The diagnosis of dementia was limited by the history and examination findings documented in the chart. Our study spanned over 36-years, during which time the understanding and diagnostic criteria have changed. Multiple visits were reviewed, and uniform diagnostic criteria were applied to minimize the bias. Definitive diagnosis of AD with brain biopsy was not conducted but this is not a routine clinical practice. It is also possible that patients with OAG had greater contact with healthcare providers, increasing the chance of detection of dementia compared to the rest of the population. Despite this possible bias, we did not detect an increased rate of dementia in OAG patients. Similarly, it is possible that OAG patients had better risk factor management, such as control of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. However, this effect was likely limited by the easy access to primary and specialty health care for the population of Olmsted County, MN. Finally, the population in Olmsted County is predominately white, and findings in this study may not be generalizable to other populations.39

In summary, our study found a decreased risk for the development of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia in patients with glaucoma compared to the general population. Additionally, common comorbid and health risk factors for glaucoma were not found to be significant predictors for diagnosis of dementia, but educational level and years, history of stroke, and past head injury were significant predictors for dementia, which are well established by clinicians and the literature. Age at onset of glaucoma was also a strong predictor for the development of dementia, which suggests the possibility that late-onset OAG is a different etio-pathogenetic entity, sharing potential similarities with neurodegenerative mechanisms seen in dementia and AD, in contrast to OAG with younger onset. However, further research is needed to better elucidate this relationship. Although glaucoma and AD are both age-related, neurodegenerative diseases with the possibility for similar ocular presentation and pathophysiological mechanisms, our findings support a decreased risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia in patients with glaucoma.
