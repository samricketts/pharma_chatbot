Alcohol consumption and genetic risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) are among many factors known to be associated with brain structure in cognitively healthy adults. It is unclear, however, whether the effect of alcohol consumption on brain structure varies depending on a person’s level of genetic risk for AD. We hypothesized that there is an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and a 33-SNP AD polygenic risk score (PRS) on the cortical thickness of brain regions known to be affected early in the course of AD. Studying 6213 cognitively healthy subjects from the UK Biobank, we found a significant interaction effect of the 33-SNP AD PRS and alcohol consumption on this AD Cortical Thickness Signature. Stratified, among those who consume 12-24 g/day of alcohol, the 33-SNP AD PRS had a significant, positive association with AD Cortical Thickness Signature, with high risk subjects having the greatest AD Cortical Thickness Signature. There were no significant associations of the 33-SNP AD PRS with AD Cortical Thickness Signature among the nondrinker or &lt;1, 1-6, 6-12, 24-48, or &gt;48 g/day groups. It is unclear whether this interaction is due to a detrimental or beneficial effect of moderate alcohol consumption in those with the highest genetic risk for AD.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption is known to be associated with structural brain health (Topiwala et al., 2017). Genetic factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are also known to be associated with brain structure, even in cognitively healthy subjects (Lupton et al., 2016). However, the isolated presence of alcohol consumption or genetic risk factors does not guarantee an increased level of brain atrophy or dementia risk. It is possible then that the effect of alcohol consumption on the brain is modified by the presence of genetic risk variants for AD.

Results from several studies have suggested the existence of an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and AD genetic risk on cognition, brain structure, and dementia risk, though the nature of this interaction is unclear. Some studies have found an increased risk of dementia and poorer cognitive health with alcohol consumption among those at elevated risk for AD. For instance, a study of midlife alcohol consumption and dementia risk by Anttila et al found an interaction of alcohol consumption and apoE-4 on dementia risk, with the dementia risk of apoE-4 carriers increased with increasing amounts of alcohol consumption (Anttila et al., 2004). Another study found a similar relationship for cognitive abilities, in which alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline among apoE-4 carriers, but a decreased risk in apoE-4 noncarriers (Dufouil et al., 2000).

Other studies, however, have suggested increased brain health with light-to-moderate alcohol consumption in subjects with the AD genetic risk factor apoE-4. In a study by den Heijer et al, for example, the evidence suggested an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and apoE genotype on the hippocampal volume in cognitively healthy adults. In apoE-4 carriers, increased alcohol consumption was found to be associated with increased hippocampal volume (den Heijer et al., 2004). A study of cognitive function in elderly men found that light alcohol consumption was associated with increased cognitive function, and that this increase in cognitive function with light alcohol consumption was even greater in apoE-4 carriers (Carmelli, Swan, Reed, Schellenberg, &amp; Christian, 1999). In a longitudinal study of cognition, a more rapid decline in memory for carriers of apoE-4 relative to noncarriers was found only among nondrinkers (Reas, Laughlin, Kritz-Silverstein, Barrett-Connor, &amp; McEvoy, 2016). However, several studies have not found any such interaction effect (Heffernan et al., 2016; Herring &amp; Paulson, 2018; Reas et al., 2016; Ruitenberg et al., 2002).

Somewhat contradictory study results investigating alcohol consumption and AD genetic risk alone also suggest the possibility of interactions with genetic variants and alcohol consumption. For instance, while some studies show that alcohol in moderate quantities is beneficial to the brain, others show that all levels of consumption are detrimental. One study showed that alcohol consumption at all levels was associated with increased hippocampal atrophy (Topiwala et al., 2017). Another, however, showed that moderate consumption of alcohol had possible benefits to the white matter of the brain (McEvoy et al., 2018). Additionally, a study by Li et al found that cognitively healthy subjects carrying the apoE-4 allele had a greater cortical thickness in AD-associated brain regions than that of non-carriers, opposite to the expected trend of apoE-4 carriers having a decreased cortical thickness (C. Li et al., 2017).

Cell-based and mouse studies give further evidence of an interaction of alcohol consumption and AD genetic risk factors. For instance, cell-based studies have found that apoE-4 synergistically increases the neurotoxicity of alcohol consumption, with apoE-4 leading to increased oxidative stress within cells and apoptosis in the presence of high concentrations of alcohol (J. Li &amp; Cheng, 2018). In addition, a recent mouse study found that low alcohol exposure has beneficial effects on clearance of waste products in the brain (Lundgaard et al., 2018). Since AD genetic risk factors such as the ApoE-4 allele are associated with impaired clearance of amyloid beta (Wildsmith, Holley, Savage, Skerrett, &amp; Landreth, 2013), low to moderate alcohol consumption could potentially then be beneficial for those with the ApoE-4 allele if these effects in mice also are present in humans.

Discrepant results in the literature may also be due to a combination of limited sample sizes and unaccounted modifier effects. Studies of the effects of alcohol consumption on brain structures have typically been assessed using limited sample sizes (~500 to 3000 participants) (den Heijer et al., 2004; Ding Jingzhong et al., 2004; Gu et al., 2014; Kubota et al., 2001; Mukamal, Longstreth, Mittleman, Crum, &amp; Siscovick, 2001). In addition to the inconsistent results of the long-term effects of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption on brain structure, existing results of AD-related genes’ influences on brain structure in normal aging are often conflicting (Fjell &amp; Walhovd, 2010; Topiwala et al., 2017; Topiwala &amp; Ebmeier, 2018). This is likely also due to a lack of sufficient statistical power with which to detect subtle genetic effects, especially in non-pathological populations.

We therefore sought to investigate whether the effect of alcohol consumption on regions of the brain known to be affected in early AD varies based on AD genetic risk. Understanding whether such an interaction exists is important in better understanding how alcohol consumption leads to structural brain changes and increases in dementia risk. Our hypothesis was that there is an interaction effect of a 33-SNP AD polygenic risk score and alcohol consumption on the cortical thickness of AD-associated regions, known as the AD Cortical Thickness Signature. Data from 6213 cognitively healthy subjects from the UK Biobank were used to investigate this hypothesis. The large sample size offered by the UK Biobank enables sufficient statistical power for detecting such an interaction effect.

Methods

Study Population

To investigate these hypotheses, brain imaging, genetics, and health data for cognitively healthy subjects were obtained from the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank is a large study enrolling about 500,000 participants in the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2010 with baseline ages ranging from 40-69 years (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). Written informed consent was provided by all UK Biobank subjects. Ethics approval for the UK Biobank was provided by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee (Sudlow et al., 2015). The selection of only cognitively normal subjects with appropriate imaging data followed the same procedure detailed in Zhao et al (Zhao et al., 2018). Briefly, only those subjects with brain MRI data that passed quality control and image processing, without a reported neurological or psychiatric disorder, with white British ancestry, and with a passable genetic sample quality were included in the study. Beyond this selection process, only subjects with complete cases for all of the studied variables were included in the final study data set. Subjects with a value of “prefer not to answer” for the educational history categorical variable were removed. In addition, subjects with a documented past medical history of heart attack or stroke were removed from the study.

Alzheimer Disease Cortical Thickness Signature and Hippocampal Volume

Brain imaging data was processed using FreeSurfer v6.0 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) to extract region-of-interest based cortical thickness measurements and subcortical volumes (Fischl et al., 2002). Details are equivalent to those in Zhao et al (Zhao et al., 2018). We chose to investigate a set of regions previously shown to be affected early in AD pathogenesis and that can be automatically measured using FreeSurfer v6.0. Since the study population consists of only cognitively healthy subjects, we expected that any changes in brain structure due to the factors studied were more likely to be in these regions of brain than other regions of the brain. An AD Cortical Thickness Signature was created based on that created by Sabuncu et al (Sabuncu et al., 2011). We selected a subset of these regions to include in the AD Cortical Thickness Signature we studied. In particular, we omitted regions with a tendency to have segmentation errors that when not manually corrected are more likely to lead to altered study results (McCarthy et al., 2015). So, the final outcome variable in this study consisted of the average bilateral thickness of the superior temporal, middle temporal, inferior temporal, inferior parietal, and posterior cingulate brain regions. Left and right hippocampal volumes were averaged to give the average bilateral hippocampal volume. Due to the large sample size, scan-by-scan quality control of the FreeSurfer output was unfeasible. Extreme outliers were examined, two of which were removed due to severe errors.

AD Polygenic Risk Score

A weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) was computed for all subjects based on the 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that constitute the AD polygenic hazard score developed by Desikan et al (Desikan et al., 2017). Two of the SNPs making up this PRS are the two SNPs that determine apoE genotype, rs7412 and rs429358. Four SNPs in this polygenic hazard score were not available in the genetics data of the UK Biobank study population. These SNPs were replaced by alternative SNPs. The SNP in the abParts locus, rs7145100, was replaced by the SNP rs7146073, a SNP in high linkage disequilibrium with rs7145100 (r2=1) based on the CEU population of the 1000 Genomes Project, Phase 3 (Machiela &amp; Chanock, 2015). The SNP in the CLU locus, rs9331888, was replaced by the SNP rs11136000, another SNP in the CLU locus that has been found to be significantly associated with progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia (Lacour et al., 2017). The two SNPs of the polygenic hazard score within the ABCA7 locus, rs3752246 and rs7408475, were replaced by two other SNPs in the ABCA7 locus, SNPs rs3764650 and rs4147929, that have also been found to be associated with AD (Efthymiou &amp; Goate, 2017).

Additionally, apoE-4 carrier status and a 31-SNP PRS not including the apoE-4 SNPs were computed. ApoE genotype was determined from the genotyping of its two SNPs, rs7412 and rs429358. It was assumed that subjects heterozygous at each of these SNPs had the apoE-2,4 genotype given the rarity of the apoE-1,3 genotype (Ordovas, Litwack-Klein, Wilson, Schaefer, &amp; Schaefer, 1987). A 31-SNP polygenic risk score was computed the same way as the 33-SNP PRS, except for not including the two apoE genotype SNPs.

The PRSice-2 software (version 2.1.0.beta, https://choishingwan.github.io/PRSice/) was used for computing the polygenic risk scores (Euesden, Lewis, &amp; O’Reilly, 2015). Effect sizes used as weights in the computation of these risk scores were obtained from The International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP). The “International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) is a large two-stage study based upon genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on individuals of European ancestry. In stage 1, IGAP used genotyped and imputed data on 7,055,881 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to meta-analyse four previously-published GWAS datasets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls (The European Alzheimer's disease Initiative – EADI the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium – ADGC The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium – CHARGE The Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD consortium – GERAD). In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer's disease cases and 11,312 controls. Finally, a meta-analysis was performed combining results from stages 1 &amp; 2” (Lambert et al., 2013).

Health Data Variables

Alcohol consumption data was obtained in the same way as in Zhao et al and was treated as a categorical variable using the following grouping: 0, &lt;1, 1-6, 6-12, 12-24, 24-48, and &gt;48 g/day of alcohol consumption (Zhao et al., 2018). Alcohol consumption frequency was used in some analyses as a categorical variable with the values of “Never”, “Special occasions only”, “One to three times a month”, “Once or twice a week”, “Three or four times a week”, and “Daily or almost daily”. Body mass index (BMI) was also treated as a categorical variable. Subjects were defined as being underweight (BMI of &lt;18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2), or obese (BMI of &gt;30 kg/m2). Underweight subjects were removed for all analyses because of their small sample size (n=37) and the potential source of bias from their inclusion, given that weight loss can be indicative of poor health and has been shown to precede diagnosis of AD (D. K. Johnson, Wilkins, &amp; Morris, 2006). Variables representing hypertension and diabetes represent a self-reported previous diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes, respectively. The extent of control of hypertension and diabetes with medication is not accounted for in this study. Tobacco smoking is represented by smoking intensity, calculated by dividing pack years by the number of years smoked, yielding an average measure of packs per day.

Statistical Analysis

Mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables were computed to characterize the study population. Tests for differences in each variable among the alcohol consumption groups were conducted using a chi-squared test for categorical variables and ANOVA for continuous variables. Linear models were used to test each research question. Covariates included in every model that were selected a priori included sex, age, education, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, AD genetic risk, and the first 5 principal components (PC1-PC5) estimating population substructure. For models of average hippocampal volume only, intracranial volume was also used as a covariate. All continuous variables were mean-centered, except for intracranial volume (ICV), which was median-centered. The reference level for daily alcohol consumption was set to “1-6 g/day” and the reference level for alcohol consumption frequency was set to “Once or twice a week”. The reference level for BMI was set to “Normal weight” and the reference level for the education variable was set to “College or University degree”. When plotting the mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature and hippocampal volume values for the various alcohol consumption and genetic risk groups, fixed values for the covariates were used. In particular, the mean outcome variables were evaluated at the reference levels for categorical variables, the median of ICV, the zero value for the hypertension and diabetes variables, and the mean value for the remainder of the continuous covariates.

Linear regression was first used to investigate the effect of alcohol consumption on both AD Cortical Thickness Signature and mean hippocampal volume without consideration of an interaction with genetic risk for AD. The effect of alcohol consumption was also examined among only those who consume alcohol at least once per week, with adjustment for alcohol consumption frequency. The associations of the outcome variables with alcohol consumption frequency were also investigated. Linear regression was next used to test the hypothesis that there is an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and the 33-SNP AD PRS on AD Cortical Thickness Signature. The interaction effect was also investigated for average hippocampal volume. Each alcohol interaction was additionally evaluated among only subjects who consume alcohol at least once per week, with adjustment for alcohol frequency. A model with a triple interaction term for alcohol consumption amount, alcohol consumption frequency, and AD 33-SNP PRS was used to investigate whether the interaction varied among alcohol consumption frequency groups. Finally, a model with a triple interaction term for grouped ages (45-60, 60-70, and 70-80 years old), alcohol consumption amount, and AD 33-SNP PRS was used to test for differences in the interaction effect among different age groups. P-values were obtained via either a likelihood ratio test (LRT) comparing the model with the interaction term of interest to the reduced model without this interaction term or an F-test from the ANCOVA model. The alpha level for determining statistical significance was set to 0.05. Standard regression diagnostics were completed to ensure that assumptions for linear regression were met and to determine whether any one data point would significantly alter the result.

Since interactions between covariates and the modifiable risk factor of interest, in addition to interactions between covariates and the genetic factor of interest, can confound the interaction term of interest, the impact of the inclusion of such plausible interactions was investigated in a separate modeling step, referred to as the fully-adjusted models (Keller, 2014). For the model testing the interaction of alcohol consumption and the 33-SNP AD PRS, these interaction terms include the alcohol-by-sex, alcohol-by-age, alcohol-by-smoking, alcohol-by-hypertension, alcohol-by-diabetes, alcohol-by-BMI, PRS-by-sex, PRS-by-age, PRS-by-smoking, PRS-by-hypertension, PRS-by-diabetes, and PRS-by-BMI terms. The written-out model can be found in the supplementary material.

For investigating the nature of the interaction effect for any significant interactions, separate models were fit using categorical variables for the AD 33-SNP PRS. Specifically, the AD 33-SNP PRS was divided into three percentile groups: 0-20%, 20-80%, and 80-100%. The 80-100% group represents those with the highest risk for AD. These ANCOVA models were used to plot the estimated mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature values at each level of alcohol consumption and each level of the genetic groupings. In addition, stratified analysis was used to determine whether the AD genetic risk effect was significant within each alcohol consumption group separately. Finally, for the alcohol consumption and 33-SNP PRS interaction, post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine if this interaction was driven entirely by the two SNPs that make up the apoE genotype, or if the other 31-SNPs together also have an interaction effect with that factor. The 31-SNP PRS post-hoc analysis was conducted only among non-carriers of the ApoE-4 allele. Given the relatively small effect sizes of the SNPs that make up the 31-SNP PRS and the expectation that only those in the highest percentiles of this PRS would be at a very significantly elevated risk for AD, the following percentile groups were examined: 0-5%, 5-25%, 25-75%, 75-95%, 95-100%. Groups with similar estimates were combined together when plotting the results.

Results

Demographics

The dataset consisted of 6250 subjects that met the inclusion criteria. 37 underweight subjects were removed, yielding a final dataset of 6213 subjects with a mean age of 62.4 years. 184 (3%) subjects reported consuming no alcohol per day, 321 (5.2%) less than 1 g/day, 1368 (22%) 1-6 g/day, 1243 (20%) 6-12 g/day, 1589 (25.5%) 12-24 g/day, 1106 (17.8%) 24-48 g/day, and 402 (6.5%) &gt;48 g/day. Descriptive statistics for the final study population by alcohol consumption group are shown in Table 1. The maximum amount of alcohol consumption reported by a subject was 161.2 g/day. Significant differences in age, sex, education, alcohol consumption frequency, tobacco smoking, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, AD 33-SNP PRS, AD Cortical Thickness Signature, and mean hippocampal volume were found among the alcohol consumption groups. The regression models all satisfied the assumptions for linear regression and were not significantly influenced by any one subject.

Association of alcohol consumption and the AD Polygenic Risk Score with AD Cortical Thickness Signature and Hippocampal Volume

We found a statistically significant difference in the AD Cortical Thickness Signature among the binned alcohol consumption groups after adjustment for covariates (F(6,6187) = 12.0, p = 2.0e-13). Comparison of the mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature of each group relative to that of the 1-6 g/day group, after adjustment, can be found in Table 2. Model-predicted estimates of the mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature for each alcohol consumption group is plotted in Figure 1a. The 33-SNP PRS was not found to be significantly associated with AD Cortical Thickness Signature (p = 0.24). The mean AD cortical thickness signature had an inverted-U-shaped relationship with daily alcohol consumption, with the 1-6 g/day group having the highest estimated thickness. Relative to this 1-6 g/day group, the “None”, 24-48 g/day, and &gt;48 g/day groups each had a significantly lower thickness after correcting for multiple comparisons. We also found a statistically significant difference in the average bilateral hippocampal volume among the binned alcohol consumption groups after adjustment for covariates (F(6,6186) = 2.41, p = 0.025). Comparison of the mean hippocampal volume of each group relative to that of the 1-6 g/day group, after adjustment, can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Model-predicted estimates of mean hippocampal volume for each alcohol consumption group is plotted in Supplementary Figure 1a. The 33-SNP PRS was also not found to be significantly associated with hippocampal volume (p = 0.72). The associations of alcohol consumption on AD Cortical Thickness Signature and hippocampal volume after adjustment for alcohol consumption frequency are described in the supplementary material and are plotted in Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure 1b, respectively. Alcohol consumption frequency was not significantly associated with these metrics and its addition as a covariate did not have a strong influence on the model output.

Interaction effect of alcohol consumption and genetic risk for AD

We found that the data supported our hypothesis that among cognitively healthy subjects, there is an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and AD genetic risk on the AD Cortical Thickness Signature. A model with an interaction term for alcohol consumption and the AD 33-SNP PRS was found to fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 16.9, p = 0.0098). A summary of the model output can be found in Table 3. The same analysis was conducted using only apoE-4 carrier status, representing two SNPs of the full 33-SNP AD PRS, in addition to using only the 31-SNP AD PRS among apoE-4 noncarriers. A model with an interaction term for alcohol consumption and apoE-4 carrier status fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 13.5, p = 0.036). Among apoE-4 noncarriers, a model with an interaction term for alcohol consumption and the AD 31-SNP PRS did not fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 2.19, p = 0.90). A summary of the model output for these models can be found in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. Using the binned versions of the AD 33-SNP PRS and the 31-SNP PRS, model-predicted mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature values for each alcohol consumption group were plotted as described in the methods section and are shown in Figure 2. Among subjects in the &lt;1 g/day group, for instance, those in the 80-100% AD PRS group had a lower estimated mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature than that of the 0-20% and 20-80% AD PRS group. Among subjects consuming between 12 and 24 grams of alcohol per day, however, those in the 80-100% AD PRS group PRS group had a higher mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature than that of the 0-20% and 20-80% AD PRS group. A similar pattern of effect estimates was found in the post-hoc analyses of apoE genotype alone and in the analyses of the 31-SNP AD PRS among ApoE-4 non-carriers. So, moderate alcohol consumption was estimated to be associated with a greater AD Cortical Thickness Signature in those with a high genetic risk for AD than in those without a high genetic risk for AD. Estimation of the beta coefficient for the AD 33-SNP PRS term was also conducted separately in groups stratified by alcohol consumption amount. After adjustment for multiple testing, only the 12-24 g/day alcohol consumption group had a significant effect for AD 33-SNP PRS on AD Cortical Thickness Signature. Among those who consume 12-24 g/day of alcohol and adjusting for covariates, the estimated mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature increased by 6.7e-3 (95% CI: 2.1e-3, 0.011) mm per increase of 0.852 units of the AD 33-SNP PRS (1 standard deviation of the AD 33-SNP PRS among all subjects) (p = 0.0043).

For average hippocampal volume, a model with an interaction term for alcohol consumption and the AD 33-SNP PRS was not found to fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 6.62, p = 0.36). A summary of the model output can be found in Supplementary Table 4. A model with an interaction term for alcohol consumption and apoE-4 carrier status was also found to not fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 8.19, p = 0.22). Among ApoE-4 noncarriers, a model with an interaction term for alcohol consumption and the AD 31-SNP PRS was not found to fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 2.34, p = 0.89). Using the binned versions of the AD 33-SNP PRS and the 31-SNP PRS, model-predicted AD Cortical Thickness Signature values were plotted as described in the methods section and are shown in Supplementary Figure 2. Considering only those who consume alcohol, though, among those in the 80-100% group of the AD 33-SNP PRS, the 12-24 and 24-48 g/day groups had the highest estimated average hippocampal volumes.

Adjustment for alcohol consumption frequency in the linear models yielded similar results for both the AD cortical thickness signature and hippocampal volume, as described in the Supplementary Material and shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3. In addition, using the model with a triple interaction of binned alcohol consumption, binned age, and AD 33-SNP PRS, we found that the interaction of alcohol consumption and AD 33-SNP PRS on AD Cortical Thickness Signature did not vary by age-group (F(12,6153) = 1.01, p = 0.44). The interaction of alcohol consumption and AD 33-SNP PRS on average bilateral hippocampal volume also did not vary by age-group (F(12,6152) = 0.997, p = 0.45).

In the fully adjusted model for AD Cortical Thickness Signature, the model including the interaction term for binned alcohol consumption and AD 33-SNP PRS fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 19.5, p = 0.0034). Importantly, the overall relationship of the interaction of alcohol consumption and AD 33-SNP PRS on AD Cortical Thickness Signature did not change with adjustment for covariate-by-genotype and covariate-by-factor interactions, as can be seen in the plot of the model estimates in Supplementary Figure 4a. In the fully adjusted model for average hippocampal volume, the model including the interaction term for binned alcohol consumption and AD 33-SNP PRS did not fit the data significantly better than a model without this interaction term (χ2(6) = 7.50, p = 0.277). The overall trends are similar to that in the partially-adjusted model, as shown in Supplementary Figure 4b.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the effect of alcohol consumption on brain structure and tested whether this effect varies depending a person’s level of genetic risk for AD. For the associations of both AD Cortical Thickness Signature and average hippocampal volume with alcohol consumption, without consideration of any interaction effects, we found similar relationships to those in other studies. Alcohol consumption was significantly associated with both AD Cortical Thickness Signature and hippocampal volume. In the analyses of AD Cortical Thickness Signature, an inverted-U-shaped relationship was found, similar to relationships found previously with alcohol consumption (Anttila et al., 2004). Those in the 1-6 g/day alcohol consumption category did not have a significantly different AD Cortical Thickness Signature than those in the &lt;1, 6-12, and 12-24 g/day groups, but had a significantly increased AD Cortical Thickness Signature relative to the “None”, 24-48, and &gt;48 g/day groups, suggesting that low-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with better structural brain health in regions of the brain known to be affected early in AD. In the analyses of hippocampal volume, this inverted-U-shaped relationship was much less pronounced. Only those in the &gt;48 g/day group had a significantly decreased volume relative to the 1-6 g/day group. This inverted-U-shaped relationship, however, in which abstinence from alcohol and high alcohol consumption groups have a lower cortical thickness than that of low-moderate alcohol consumption groups, could potentially be due to reverse causation rather than a protective effect of low-moderate alcohol consumption (Fekjær, 2013).

In addition to studying the main effect of alcohol consumption on brain structure, the main effect of the AD 33-SNP PRS was investigated. It is notable that the AD 33-SNP PRS was not significantly associated with either the AD Cortical Thickness Signature or average hippocampal volume. This null finding has also been found by others using data from the UK Biobank. A study of cognitively healthy subjects in the UK Biobank found that apoE-4 was associated with increased white matter hyperintensity volumes, but not hippocampal volume, total grey matter volume, or white matter integrity (Lyall et al., 2019).

The data supported our hypothesis that there is an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and genetic risk for AD on the AD cortical thickness signature among cognitively healthy adults. Post-hoc analysis revealed that within the 12-24 g/day alcohol consumption group, those with a higher genetic risk for AD had a greater AD Cortical Thickness Signature than those with a lower genetic risk for AD. It is unclear whether this difference is due to a beneficial or detrimental effect of moderate alcohol consumption in those with a high genetic risk for AD. In the groups consuming &lt;12 g/day of alcohol, the high-risk group (80-100% AD PRS) had a lower estimated thickness than the medium-risk (20-80% AD PRS) group. In the groups consuming &gt;12 g/day of alcohol, though, the high-risk group had a higher estimated thickness than the medium-risk group. While not statistically significant, there was a similar pattern in the average hippocampal volume estimates. In the groups consuming &lt;12 g/day of alcohol, the high-risk group had a lower estimated hippocampal volume than the medium-risk group, but in the groups consuming &gt;24 g/day, the high-risk group had a higher estimated hippocampal volume than the medium-risk group. This is a similar pattern to that found in a previous study, which found an increased hippocampal volume among moderate alcohol consumers with apoE-4 (den Heijer et al., 2004).

The interaction effects we found were not statistically significant when considering only those who consume alcohol at least once per week, but the overall pattern was not different from the pattern found when considering the entire study population. Post-hoc analysis for apoE-4 carrier status and the AD 31-SNP PRS among apoE-4 noncarriers suggested that the interaction effect was not driven entirely by the apoE gene, but rather AD genetic risk in general. In addition, we found that this interaction effect did not vary significantly by age group, indicating that there was no significant difference in the interaction of alcohol consumption and AD genetic risk among 45-60, 60-70, and 70-80 year old subjects. This suggests that this interaction effect is not strongly age-dependent among those who are 45-80 years old. Furthermore, it is important to consider the results of the fully-adjusted models that include each of the relevant covariate-by-PRS and covariate-by-alcohol interactions to see if the interaction effect is changed by the inclusion of these possible confounders. The nature of the interaction of alcohol consumption and the AD 33-SNP PRS on brain structure did not change with their addition. Likely because of the increased variance in brain structure explained by these additional interaction terms in the model, the p-value for these interaction terms of interest were decreased slightly.

The direction of this interaction effect of alcohol and the 33-SNP AD PRS was different from what we had expected. Heavy alcohol consumption is known to be associated with an increased level of brain cortical atrophy (Topiwala &amp; Ebmeier, 2018). In addition, while evidence has been mixed as to whether cortical thickness is associated with genetic risk for AD in cognitively healthy subjects, a longitudinal study of 497 cognitively normal subjects found that apoE-4 is associated with increased amyloid deposition as early as middle age, in addition to a modest increase in medial temporal lobe structural atrophy (Mishra et al., 2018). So, we had expected that alcohol consumers with a high AD genetic risk would have a magnified level of atrophy. The data did not support this expectation, and instead was consistent with the results of studies that have found reduced cognitive decline and brain atrophy with low-moderate alcohol consumption among those with high genetic risk for AD (Carmelli et al., 1999; den Heijer et al., 2004; Reas et al., 2016). It is unclear why in the stratified analyses the AD 33-SNP PRS effect on AD Cortical Thickness Signature was significant only within the 12-24 g/day groups. If alcohol is having a protective effect among high AD genetic risk subjects, the data suggests that these protective effects are only present with moderate consumption of alcohol, particularly 12-24 g/day. At heavy levels of alcohol consumption, the known detrimental effects of alcohol likely predominate any protective effects. Notably, the results do not suggest that having a high genetic risk for AD exacerbates the negative effects of heavy alcohol consumption.

Even though the thickness was estimated to be greatest in the 12-24 g/day consumption group among the high-risk subjects, there is a possibility that this could represent a detrimental effect of alcohol consumption in this group instead of a protective effect. For example, some studies have found an increased brain cortical thickness in cognitively healthy subjects in regions with high amyloid beta deposition, a key pathological characteristic of AD, prior to the onset of dementia. This may be due to an increase in thickness due to AD pathology prior to eventual atrophy or a higher cognitive reserve among those with AD pathology but without dementia (Chételat et al., 2010; Fortea et al., 2011; S. C. Johnson et al., 2014). So, the increase in thickness we found could also be due to a pathological change, whether from amyloid beta deposition or another cause. Or, it is possible that this increase in cortical thickness with regular alcohol consumption is a result of a compensatory increase in synaptic sprouting, as has been seen in rats treated with alcohol (Lundqvist, Volk, Knoth, &amp; Alling, 1994).

Reverse causation and abstainer bias could also potentially explain the interaction. It is possible that those who experience subtle memory difficulties indicative of early mild cognitive impairment are more likely to reduce or stop their consumption of alcohol, leading to an abundance of subjects with early dementia-related brain changes in the very low alcohol consumption groups (Hassing, 2018). Alternatively, the subjects at high risk for AD that were included in the study could be those whose brains are particularly resilient to the dementia for any number of reasons, while those with less resilient brains could have been those not included in the study as a result of already having converted to a state of cognitive impairment.

While this study has strengths including its large sample size, there are several limitations. First, because the study is cross-sectional, it is impossible to determine whether alcohol consumption leads to changes in cortical thickness or if changes in cortical thickness result in changes in alcohol consumption habits. Second, because alcohol consumption data is self-reported, it is subject to survey bias and social desirability bias. Furthermore, this alcohol consumption data represented the reported alcohol usage at solely the imaging visit. The alcohol consumption data therefore does not account for changes in alcohol consumption over a subject’s life. Some subjects may report drinking small amounts per day despite having a former history of consuming large quantities of alcohol. Other biases may be present that could make the results misleading. Selection bias could result in only the healthiest of the high AD genetic risk subjects participating in the study, for instance. Attrition bias could result in the loss of unhealthiest subjects who had begun participation in the study, which could disproportionately affect subjects with high AD genetic risk. It is also important to note that while FreeSurfer measures cortical thickness, other brain structural changes unrelated to cortical thickness can cause changes to the measured thickness. For example, measurements of the entorhinal cortex are often influenced by the proximity of the meninges to the brain tissue in that region (Xie et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the data showed that the association of brain structure with alcohol consumption varies depending on one’s genetic risk for AD.

Replication of the results in this study is essential. No other currently available dataset that we know of has sufficient statistical power to replicate this study. Similar studies using AD risk as an outcome variable will also be useful. Amyloid PET imaging studies would also be very useful in determining if alcohol consumption is associated with amyloid deposition in the brain, and whether this deposition varies depending on one’s genetic risk for AD. Existing post-mortem studies of the association of amyloid beta deposition and alcohol consumption so far have not found an increase in AD pathology with excessive alcohol consumption, though these studies have been limited in their sample size (Aho, Karkola, Juusela, &amp; Alafuzoff, 2009; Venkataraman, Kalk, Sewell, Ritchie, &amp; Lingford-Hughes, 2017). Amyloid beta blood biomarkers could also be used for this purpose. Longitudinal studies may also be very useful for studying how the brain changes over time with alcohol consumption and whether there is an interaction effect of alcohol consumption and genetic risk for AD. Animal studies, such as with a mouse model with human apoE-4 and APP, could be useful for better understanding this interaction of alcohol consumption and AD genetic risk variants.

Conclusion

Among cognitively healthy subjects, we found that alcohol consumption was associated with both the AD Cortical Thickness Signature and mean hippocampal volume, similar to what has been found in prior studies. An inverted-U-shaped relationship was found for AD Cortical Thickness Signature. For mean hippocampal volume, this inverted-U-shaped relationship was much less pronounced, with only the high alcohol consumption group having a significantly lower hippocampal volume relative to the low alcohol consumption group. Moreover, we found a significant interaction effect of alcohol consumption and a 33-SNP AD polygenic risk score. Among those consuming 12-24 g/day of alcohol, those with the highest genetic risk for AD had the greatest AD Cortical Thickness Signature. It is unclear whether the increased mean AD Cortical Thickness Signature among moderate alcohol consumers with a high AD genetic risk represents a protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption or if the increased cortical thickness is due to other pathological mechanisms. Regardless, the data supports the hypothesis that the association of brain structure and alcohol consumption varies based on one’s genetic risk factors for AD.
