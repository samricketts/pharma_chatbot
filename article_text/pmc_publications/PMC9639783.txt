Background:

Whether diabetes and adipokine-driven inflammation explain the association of obesity to cognitive impairment is unknown.

Methods:

Structural equation models estimated total effects of waist circumference on cognitive outcomes among African American participants cross-sectionally (index exam) and longitudinally. Total effects were deconstructed into direct pathways of waist circumference to cognitive impairment and indirect mediation pathways through leptin, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2), and diabetes. Waist circumference, leptin, and sTNFR2 were standardized. Cognitive impairment was defined as MMSE &lt;21 or a z-score &lt;−1.5 standard deviation (SD). Incident cognitive impairment was defined among those without cognitive impairment at the index exam as follow-up MMSE&lt;21, z- score&lt;−1.5, MMSE decline &gt;1 point/year, or z-score decline of &gt;0.1 SD/year.

Results:

Among 1008 participants (70% women, mean age 62.9 years, 14.5% with obesity, 26% with diabetes), 132 (13%) had baseline cognitive impairment. Each SD higher waist circumference was associated with higher odds of cognitive impairment, odds ratio (OR) =1.63; (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 2.24), with mediating pathways explaining 65% of the total effect (58% from diabetes; 7% from inflammation). At follow-up (mean 6.8 years), 106 of 535 (19.8%) had developed cognitive impairment. Each SD higher waist circumference was associated with higher odds of developing cognitive impairment (OR=1.87; 95%CI: 1.18, 2.74); the direct effect of waist circumference explained 37% of the total effect and mediating pathways explained 63% (61% from diabetes; 2% from inflammation), although individual pathways were not statistically supported in the smaller sample.

Conclusion:

Diabetes, and to a lesser degree, adiposity-driven inflammation, appear to explain a substantial proportion of abdominal adiposity relationships with cognitive impairment. The impact of preventing and treating obesity on cognitive outcomes merits study.

pmcIntroduction

Dementia affects over five million people in the United States and 47 million people worldwide and has become one of the most ominous medical challenges of the 21st century.1 African American individuals are two to three times more likely to have Alzheimer Disease (AD) and related dementias than White individuals in the US. The estimated cost of care for African American individuals with AD in 2012 was $72 billion.2 Obesity is an emerging but complex risk factor for dementia, with strong support when measured in mid-life but attenuated in late life.3 Higher BMI has been associated with lower dementia risk in older age, likely due to the pre-clinical weight loss phenomenon that occurs prior to a dementia diagnosis.4 However, waist circumference relationships to cognition are stronger in older age compared to body mass index (BMI), are more consistently associated with dementia risk across age than BMI,5, 6 and, compared to BMI, waist circumference is considered a more valid measure of obesity in older adults.7

Obesity is more common in African American than White individuals8 and may contribute to the disproportionate burden of dementia in African American individuals. Mechanisms through which obesity contributes to cognitive decline and dementia have not been established.

Adipose cells produce leptin, a pro-inflammatory adipokine; obesity leads to increased size of adipose cells, dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines, and elevated leptin and TNF-α products.9, 10 sTNFR2, in particular, is higher in people with both obesity and diabetes9, 11 and is also associated with lower overall and domain-specific cognition,12 potentially playing an important role in both diabetes and cognitive impairment. Obesity is also a well-established risk factor for diabetes. Growing interest in the biology of diabetes suggests sTNFR2 could be an important factor in developing diabetes.11 In addition, diabetes is a strong risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia13 and is associated with higher sTNFR2, but not sTNFR1 levels.11 It is likely that multiple mechanisms affect cognition, yet studies primarily have examined individual contributing pathways to cognitive decline and dementia outcomes rather than multiple pathways that are more probable representations of pathophysiological systems. The omission of relevant pathophysiology biases the influence of any single pathway on outcomes of interest.

Knowledge of obesity-driven relationships with cognition including indirect influences of obesity through inflammation, adipokines, and diabetes are limited, with longitudinal studies being especially sparse. The prevailing assumption of obesity-mediated disease is that abdominal adiposity, which can be estimated with waist circumference, mediates metabolic effects of obesity that cause disease.14, 15 Elucidating these associations may lead to an improved understanding of pathways that explain obesity relationships with poorer cognitive outcomes and subsequently enable directed allocation of resources for pharmaceutical discovery, disease prevention, and interventions.

For these reasons, we hypothesized that adiposity could affect cognition through pro-inflammatory properties of leptin that stimulate TNF pathways, and through diabetes, which has well-established associations with cognitive decline, and potentially through direct and other unmeasured pathways. The purpose of our study was to examine the proportional relationships of obesity with prevalent cognitive impairment and incident cognitive impairment through three pathways: (1) direct effect of obesity on cognitive outcomes, (2) through indirect effects of adipokines and inflammation, and (3) through indirect effects of diabetes.

Methods

Data Source

The Genetic Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA) study is part of National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Family Blood Pressure Program. GENOA recruited individuals with hypertension before the age of 60 years and their siblings, of whom at least one was required to have hypertension before age 60, at the GENOA baseline visit (Visit 1, 1997–99).16 African American participants were recruited from Jackson, Mississippi, the cohort for this analysis. Participants were invited to GENOA visit 2 (2000–04) which is the index exam for the current analysis, and a subset (n=1,008) participated in an ancillary study, the Genetics of Microangiopathic Brain Injury (GMBI) (2001–06). GMBI assessed cognitive function and brain MRI. GMBI African American participants were offered a second cognitive assessment in 2009–11 (GENOA visit 3, our “follow-up exam”). At this follow-up, 341 did not return, and 132 participants with cognitive impairment at GENOA Visit 2 were excluded from the incident cognitive impairment analysis, leaving 535 for the analysis of incident cognitive impairment (Supplementary Figure S1). All variables considered in the current study were collected at the index exam (GENOA visit 2), except for the cognitive and diabetes assessments, which were collected at both the index and follow up exams (GENOA visit 3). The study protocol was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent.

Obesity and Mediator Measures

Obesity was assessed as waist circumference with participants barefooted and wearing lightweight clothes at the index exam. Waist circumference was recorded to the nearest 0.1cm at the umbilicus at the end of exhalation. Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or greater, random glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater, self-report, or glucose-lowering medication use at the index exam. For the analysis of incident cognitive impairment, we operationalized diabetes as having a diagnosis of diabetes at the index and the follow-up exam, using the same criteria, to fully capture mediating influences of diabetes.

Fasting blood samples from the index exam were drawn and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4⁰C, aliquoted in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid plasma stored at −80⁰C, and sent on dry ice for batch processing at the Mayo Clinic Immunochemical Core Laboratory. Leptin was assayed using an ELISA (Linco Research, Inc, MO). Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2) levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immuno-sandwich based assay on an SQ-120 MSD instrument with a cryogenically cooled coupled device camera detector which converts electrical signals from photons into digital values (Discovery Workbench version 4.0; MSD platform, Meso Scale Discovery Rockville, Maryland).

Outcomes: Cognitive Measures

Cognitive tests were offered to all participants and administered using standardized protocols as previously described.17 Timed tests were multiplied by negative one so that higher values reflect better cognition on all tests. We standardized all coefficients by subtracting the population mean from each observed value and dividing by the standard deviation (SD) of the population to create z-scores, which allows comparisons across measures with different units of measure. The MMSE assessed global cognitive function.18, 19 The digit symbol substitution task and Trail Making Test (TMT) A assessed processing speed.19 Memory was assessed using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.19, 20 The Word Fluency Test (letters F, A, and S) and the Animal Naming Task assessed language.18, 19 TMT B assessed executive function.19 We created a global cognition z-score by averaging z-scores of individual tests to reduce measurement error of individual tests, especially floor and ceiling effects.21, 22

Baseline cognitive impairment was defined at GENOA visit 2, the index exam for this study, by an MMSE score less than 2123 or a global cognition z-score less than −1.5.24 Incident cognitive impairment at follow-up was defined among cognitively unimpaired participants at the index exam as having a follow-up MMSE below 21,23 a global cognitive Z-score of 1.5 SD or more below the mean,24 an MMSE decline of one or more points per year,25 or z-score decline of 0.1 SD or more per year.24

Covariates

Covariates were selected based on established relationships with waist circumference and with cognition and that are not known to lie in the causal pathway (age, sex, education) or were not supported as mediators in this population (hypertension). We examined APOE4 and smoking history because APOE4 is an important risk factor for dementia, and there is a strong scientific rationale that smoking influences cognition.26 Prevalent stroke, a contributor to cognitive impairment, was self-reported at the index visit; self-report is validated as a sensitive and specific assessment of stroke.27

Age was used as a continuous variable. Self-reported education was dichotomized as less than high school. Blood pressure was measured using the average of the second and third measurements in a rested, seated state. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg, self-report of hypertension, or antihypertensive medication use.

Brain MRI was performed on a Signa 1.5 T MRI scanner (GE Healthcare) and processed at the Mayo Clinic as previously described; median time for brain MRI completion was 12 months from the index exam.28 Briefly, total intracranial volume was measured from T1-weighted spin echo sagittal images; total brain and white matter hyperintensity volumes (cm3) were assessed from axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images.

Statistical Methods

Means (SD) and counts (percentages) were calculated for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The total, direct, and indirect effects of waist circumference on cross-sectional cognitive impairment and incident cognitive impairment were constructed using generalized structural equation models with binomial families and logit links with inverse probability weighted generalized estimating equations to account for potential informative missingness bias. The generalized structural equation model approach allows for simultaneous modeling of all pathways, thus eliminating the need for a step-wise approach to mediation analysis. Waist circumference, leptin, and sTNFR2 were standardized by creating z-scores as described for cognitive measures. Paths terminating with continuous variables leptin or sTNFR2 were submodeled assuming Gaussian families with identity links and are interpreted as one SD increase in path originator (e.g. waist circumference) was associated with one SD increase in path terminator (e.g. leptin). Likewise, paths with continuous originating variables and terminating with binary variables diabetes or cognitive impairment were submodeled assuming binomial families with logit links, and were interpreted as one SD increase in path originator was associated with a percent increase in odds of the path terminator, while the path leading from diabetes to cognitive impairment was interpreted as the increase in odds of cognitive impairment for individuals with diabetes compared to those without diabetes. Displayed paths represent direct effects. Indirect effects and total effects were calculated by applying the non-linear combinations to the direct effects. All models were adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE4, stroke, and hypertension.

Direct effects of waist circumference on cognitive outcomes did not include indirect pathways involving the mediators leptin, sTNFR2 and diabetes. Indirect effects measured the effect of waist circumference on outcomes through these mediators. Total effects were the aggregate of direct and indirect effects. Variance estimates were adjusted due to familial clustering with Huber-White sandwich estimators. Due to the very high level of participant drop-out for repeat cognitive testing at GENOA visit 3, all reported results for incident cognitive impairment are from inverse proportionally weighted models. Weights were constructed by inverting predicted probabilities from logistic models that predicted return to the follow up visit with waist circumference, leptin, sTNFR2, diabetes, and all adjusters as predictor variables. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with continuous cognitive Z-score outcomes (cross-sectional and z-score decline) with Gaussian families and identity links. Sensitivity analyses additionally adjusted for brain MRI white matter hyperintensities and cerebral atrophy. Mediating effects of hypertension were not supported cross-sectionally (OR=1.03; p=0.91) or in the incident cognitive impairment analysis (OR=0.79; p=0.38), potentially due to the limited variability of hypertension in the population. Analyses were completed in Stata v16.1. All tests were two-sided and all p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Among 1008 African American participants at the index exam who underwent cognitive assessments (GENOA Visit 2: 70% women, mean age 62.9 years), 132 (13%) were classified as cognitively impaired, 14.5% were obese, and 26% had diabetes. At follow-up (average 6.8 years), 535 (53%) of participants without cognitive impairment at the index exam completed the cognitive assessment and 106 (19.8%) had developed cognitive impairment (Table 1). Those who did not return (n=341) were older, had lower baseline MMSE scores, were less educated, and had higher sTNFR2 (Table 1).

Direct and Indirect Cross-sectional Relationships

Each SD higher waist circumference was associated with 63% higher odds of cognitive impairment cross-sectionally (total effect: OR=1.63, 95% CI 1.10, 2.17). Indirect effects explained most of the total effects; diabetes explained 58% and leptin-sTNFR2 pathways explained 7%. The direct effect of waist circumference on cognitive impairment explained the remainder (35%) (Table 2). Each SD higher waist circumference was associated with 55% higher odds of diabetes and with a 0.45 SD higher leptin (Figure 1A). Each SD higher leptin was associated with 0.22 SD higher sTNFR2. Each SD higher sTNFR2 was associated with 25% higher odds of diabetes (OR=1.25; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.47; Figure 1A) and 23% higher odds of cognitive impairment (OR=1.23; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.51). To put the waist circumference findings in context, the SD of participants’ waist circumference at the index exam was 13.6cm; a 10cm higher waist circumference is associated with an 11% higher risk of all-cause mortality.29

Direct and Indirect Longitudinal Relationships

Each SD higher waist circumference was associated with 87% higher risk for incident cognitive impairment (total effect: OR=1.87, 95% CI: 1.18, 2.74). Of this total effect, indirect effects via diabetes explained 61% and leptin-sTNFR2 explained 2%. The remaining 37% was explained through direct effects of waist circumference on incident cognitive impairment (Table 2). The relationship of sTNFR2 with diabetes no longer persisted (OR=0.97, Figure 1B). The relationship of sTNFR2 with incident cognitive impairment was similar (OR=1.14, p=0.46) to cross-sectional findings but was no longer statistically significant. Each SD higher waist circumference was associated with a 113% (p&lt;.001, Figure 1B) higher odds of diabetes. Higher waist circumference was associated with 0.44 SD higher leptin concentration (Figure 1B).

Associations were slightly attenuated when adjusting for white matter hyperintensities and atrophy but substantive interpretations were not changed (Supplementary Table S1). Results were similar using continuous cognitive score z-scores and z-score decline as outcomes instead of cognitive impairment, although results for cognitive decline were more attenuated (Supplementary Table S2).

Discussion

We sought to examine mediating pathways through which central obesity might influence cognitive impairment and incident cognitive impairment in an African American cohort. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal findings suggested that obesity-related diabetes explained a similarly large proportion of the association of central obesity with cognitive impairment; adipose-driven inflammatory pathways contributed, but to a lesser degree.

Our findings build on prior studies examining relations of poorer cognitive outcomes with obesity,9 diabetes,30 and inflammation31 by demonstrating the combined influences of obesity, diabetes, and adipokine-induced inflammation cross-sectionally with cognitive impairment and with incident cognitive impairment longitudinally. The greater influence of waist circumference on cognitive outcomes through diabetes is in line with studies suggesting that diabetes is associated with 50% increase in the risk of dementia.32

Although other studies examined diabetes or inflammation individually as mediators, our study incorporated both, providing a more holistic examination of pathways and identifying relative contributions from different pathways. For example, findings from the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia study supported a partially mediating role of midlife diabetes on dementia 21 years later during older age,33 but lacked information on inflammatory and adipokine pathways. Similar to our analysis, a cross-sectional study of middle-aged and older adults examining mediation of BMI and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein found higher BMI associations with poorer cognition were partially mediated by higher C-reactive protein and subsequently lower cognition.34 In a separate analysis that did not include C-reactive protein, these same investigators found that associations of higher BMI with lower cognition was partially mediated through higher fasting plasma glucose.34 Our findings extend this work since the mediation analysis did not incorporate clinical and inflammatory pathways simultaneously nor did it prospectively examine cognitive outcomes; rather, regression of cognition was conducted on counts of abnormal markers of interest, with no association found between the number of metabolic or biomarker abnormalities and cognition. Our study’s multipathway mediation approach, however, incorporated both inflammatory and metabolic (diabetes) pathways on concurrent cognition and incident cognitive impairment. Furthermore, our study examined sTNFR2, a specific TNF-α pathway product, while C-reactive protein is a non-specific marker of inflammation. Our findings illustrate mediation of central adiposity with cognition through prevalent and incident diabetes and, to a lesser degree, through leptin and sTNFR2 cross-sectionally. However, the relationship of TNFR2 to incident cognitive impairment was attenuated and not statistically supported which could be explained in part by the smaller sample size at the second cognitive examination. The observed proportions that each pathways contributed to cognitive impairment in the cross-sectional and the longitudinal analyses were consistent.

Most existing studies of TNF pathways are in line with our results. For example, previous small studies and a meta-analysis reported higher peripheral sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 levels in people with dementia compared to levels in people with mild cognitive impairment.35 Similar findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been observed comparing patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to healthy controls.36 However, one recent study suggested higher TNFR2 in CSF may be neuroprotective. In this study, participants with MCI who had lower CSF TNFR1 and higher CSF TNFR2 had slower progression to dementia.37 Potentially divergent roles of inflammation peripherally and centrally remain a topic of debate and intense scientific research. Other explanations for differences across studies could include limited sample sizes and different populations with varying risk factors. For example, the current study recruited participants with hypertension and a high cardiovascular risk factor burden, characteristics which are also associated with inflammation and with poorer cognitive outcomes.

Although we depict a direct pathway from waist circumference to cognitive outcomes, additional mechanisms that we did not examine could explain the direct pathway, including other inflammatory pathways and dysfunction of the cerebral vasculature. For example, obesity has been associated with smaller brain volumes,38, 39 reduced cerebral perfusion,40 and cerebral small vessel disease.41 Mouse models have demonstrated that obesity induces neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier disruption,42 which are associated with Alzheimer’s disease.43 Larger longitudinal studies with historical obesity measures, multiple inflammatory biomarkers, and novel imaging measures of cerebral pathology and cerebral vascular function would be useful to address these knowledge gaps.

Some limitations and strengths of this study warrant consideration. Our study lacked measures of amyloid and tau, the blood brain barrier, and neurovascular function; accounting for cerebral atrophy or white matter hyperintensities attenuated associations, although results were substantively unchanged. This suggests that typical markers of cerebral small vessel disease do not fully explain obesity-driven progression to cognitive impairment. A substantial number of participants did not complete the second cognitive assessment; those who were missing at the follow-up exam had higher baseline inflammation, potentially underestimating association of sTNFR2 with cognitive impairment. Although we used statistical methods to ameliorate influences of missing data, potential bias remains possible, as does residual confounding; hence, we cannot definitively establish causal pathways. The current study lacked adjudication of dementia. Additional analyses using cognitive z-scores were supported in cross-sectional analyses and showed similar estimates for cognitive decline, although these were not statistically significant. We did not incorporate time-varying levels of waist circumference or inflammatory markers; however, we did include prevalent and incident diabetes in the analyses of incident cognitive impairment. Thresholds used to define cognitive impairment could have influenced relations to incident cognitive impairment. Various factors contribute to differences in sensitivity and specificity of cognitive score cut points across groups of people, of which literacy, education and life course social exposures are particularly relevant to underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.44 Accordingly, we used race, age, and education-based thresholds that have been recommended and implemented in diverse studies to define meaningful change or impaired cognition and reduce misclassification of cognitive impairment.23 Another strength of this study is the use of waist circumference to assess adiposity, a preferred measure in older adults.7 This population was from a single community of African American individuals enriched with hypertension; the generalizability our findings to people with different predispositions to hypertension, to African American individuals in other regions or to other ethnicities/races with different cultural and life experiences is unknown.

In conclusion, our study provides novel findings in a moderately-sized African American cohort suggesting diabetes may account for a substantial proportion of observed, detrimental effects of central obesity on cognitive impairment. Adipokine-induced inflammation appears to contribute to a lesser degree.

Key Points:

Abdominal adiposity contributed to cognitive impairment largely through diabetes in this African American cohort.

Abdominal adiposity-driven inflammation contributed to cognitive impairment but to a substantially lesser degree than diabetes.

Why does this matter?

Targeting diabetes prevention and treatment could potentially have a substantial influence on cognitive health at the public health level.
