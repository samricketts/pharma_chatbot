In our continuing efforts to develop bivalent compounds as potential neuroprotectants for Alzheimer’s disease, a series of bivalent compounds that contain cholesterylamine and an extended spacer were synthesized and biologically characterized. Our results demonstrated that incorporation of a piperazine ring into the spacer composition significantly improved the protective potency in MC65 cell models. Our results also suggested that the optimal spacer length for such bivalent compounds ranges from 17 to 21 atoms, and further spacer extension beyond 21 atoms results no further optimization. Notably, incorporation of a piperazine ring into the spacer diminished the biometal chelating capacity for these bivalent compounds, thus suggesting structural flexibility of these compounds in interactions with metals. Collectively, the results provided valuable guidance to develop new bivalent compounds as neuroprotectants for Alzheimer’s disease.

Recent research have revealed the critical roles of multiple pathogenic factors in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder without cure.1 This includes protein aggregation including beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction, among others.2–6 Although significant advances have been made to understand the basic mechanisms leading to AD, the etiology of this disease still remains elusive. Consequently, the complex nature of this disease made drug discovery efforts still an unmet task. Recently, small molecules with potential multifunctional properties have attracted attention to provide effective disease-modifying agents as AD therapeutics.7–9

Our group has developed a bivalent strategy by linking a multifunctional “warhead” curcumin with a steroid type membrane-anchoring moiety via a spacer to explore their potential as AD therapeutics.10–15 This strategy was constructed based on the fact that curcumin is an important phytochemical with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-Aβ activities;16,17 and sterol analogs such as cholesterol, dihydrocholesterol and cholesterylamine have demonstrated utility as membrane anchors.13,15,18–20 Our results demonstrated the superior protective activities of the bivalent compounds compared to the “warhead” curcumin or anchoring steroid alone or the combination of these two.10–15 Furthermore, our studies suggested the important roles of the spacer that links the “warhead” and the anchoring moiety to the observed biological activity, consistent with the reported results.19 Our studies also identified an optimal spacer length ranging from 17 to 21 atoms to provide potent bivalent compounds.11,13,15 Characterization of bivalent compounds using diosgenin as the anchoring moiety suggested that spacer length beyond 26 atoms will lead to decreased protective potency.11 Given the structural flexibility of the bivalent structure due to the spacer linkage, it is not clear whether the length of the spacer can be further extended and how the change of spacer composition will impact the biological activity. Herein, we report the synthesis and biological characterization of a series of bivalent compounds containing cholesterylamine as the anchoring moiety and an extended spacer (from 21 atoms to 39 atoms with 2 atom increment each time) as model compounds to understand the impact of spacer length extension on their biological activities.

In the design of this series of bivalent compounds, we incorporated a piperazine moiety into the spacer (Figure 1) with the following reasons: 1) to increase the structural constrain of the spacer, consequently reduce the overall structural flexibility of bivalent compounds; 2) to improve the overall solubility of the designed compounds by incorporating two basic nitrogen atoms from the piperazine ring. As shown in Figure 1, the spacer length varies by 2-atom increment each time starting with 21 atoms and the maximal length is 39 atoms. For the compound coding, the Arabic numeral represents the number of atoms in the spacer, the “M” represents the connecting position of spacer on the curcumin moiety is on the “middle” position between the two carbonyl groups, and the “N” represents the connection of the spacer to the anchoring moiety is through a nitrogen.

The chemical syntheses of 21MN–27MN were achieved by following conditions outlined in Scheme 1. Briefly, reaction of cholesterylamine 1 and N-2-bromo-ethyl-phthalimide followed by Boc protection gave intermediate 2, which was refluxed with NH2NH2 in ethanol followed by reaction with 2-nitrobenzenesulfonyl (Nosyl) chloride to give N-protected intermediate 3. Reaction of 3 with N-(4-(3-bromopropyl)-1-yl) -propyl-phthalimide, which was prepared from 3-(piperazin-1-yl) propan-1-ol, followed by the removal of the Nosyl group in the presence of thiophenol gave intermediate 4. Boc protection of 4 followed by removal of the phthalimide protecting group yielded the common precursor 5. Coupling reactions of 5 with various azido-carboxylic acids afforded azido-intermediates 6, 7, 8, and 9. The click reaction of alkyne 10, obtained as previously reported,15 with 6, 7, 8, or 9 followed by removal of the Boc protecting group in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), gave bivalent compounds 21MN, 23MN, 25MN, or 27MN, respectively.

As shown in Scheme 2, reaction of 1 with 11, prepared from 3-(piperazin-1-yl)propan-1-ol with methyl 3-bromopropanoate, followed by Boc protection afforded intermediate 12. Hydrolysis of 12 with LiOH in MeOH/H2O followed by coupling reaction with N-(4-(3-aminopropyl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl- phthalimide yielded 13, which was refluxed with NH2NH2 in ethanol to afford intermediate 14. Reaction of 14 with various azido-carboxylic acids gave azido-intermediates 15–18. Click reactions of alkyne 10 with 15–18 followed by removal of the Boc protecting group gave bivalent compounds 29MN, 31MN, 33MN, and 35MN.

The syntheses of 37MN and 39MN were outlined in Scheme 3. Briefly, coupling reaction of 19, which was prepared by reaction of N-(4-(3-bromopropyl)-1-yl)-propyl-phthalimide with succinic anhydride, with 5 gave intermediate 20. Refluxing of 20 with NH2NH2 in ethanol followed by coupling reaction with 3-azido-propanoic acid or 5-azido-pentanoic acid yielded 21 and 22, respectively. Lastly, the click reaction of 21 or 22 with alkyne 10 followed by removal of the Boc protecting group afforded 37MN and 39MN, respectively.

After chemical synthesis, this series of bivalent compounds were tested to evaluate their protective potency to rescue MC65 cells. MC65 is a neuronal cell line that conditionally expresses C99, the C-terminus fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP).20,21 Upon tetracycline (TC) withdrawal, MC65 cells produce intracellular Aβ aggregates and oxidative stress, two of the suggested pathogenic factors in AD development, ultimately leading to cell death. Studies from our group and others have demonstrated this cellular assay is a suitable primary screening model to identify small molecule compounds with potential neuroprotective activities.13,15,23–25 As shown in Table 1, compound 21MN exhibited protection in the MC65 cell assay with an EC50 of 23.85 ± 2.26 nM, ~10-fold increase compared to another bivalent compound we previously reported that contains a 21-atom spacer but different spacer composition.13 This is in agreement with our recent studies to show that the spacer composition is a key factor in optimizing protective potency.28 This also suggests that incorporation of a piperazine moiety into the spacer represents a means to improve potency for future structural modifications. Overall, the increase of spacer length from 21 to 37 atoms did not significantly change the protective potency (Table 1). As evidenced by 39MN, when the spacer reached to a 39-atom length, the protective potency dropped to 93.98 ± 3.68 nM, 4-fold decrease compared to that of 21MN. Combining with the results from our previous studies,10–15 the results indicated that when the spacer reached to a 21-atom length, the protective potency in MC65 cell assays reached to a point where further spacer extension will not improve the potency significantly. Although the protective potency remained comparable for this series of bivalent compounds, when the dose-response curve for individual compounds was examined (Suppl. Figure S1), some differences were revealed. As shown in Figure 2A, bivalent compounds with a spacer length ranging from 21 to 27 atoms reached the maximal protection of MC65 cells at 0.3 µM and the protection at 1.0 µM is comparable to that of 0.3 µM. When the spacer length reached to 29 atoms, the protection at 1.0 µM started to drop significantly while the protection at 0.3 µM still remained the maximal. This may suggest that when the spacer of the bivalent compounds reaches to a certain length, e.g. 29 atoms, instrinsic cytotoxicity starts to play a role. Further spacer extension appears to increase cytotoxicity at this concentration and bivalent compound 35MN with a 35-atom spacer is the most toxic within this series. Interestingly, when the spacer length is longer than 35 atoms, the protective activity at 1.0 µM becomes comparable to that of 0.3 µM as evidenced by compounds 37MN and 39MN. This may suggest that the instrinsic toxicity gradually improves at 1.0 µM as the spacer length extends beyond 35 atoms. We also conducted computational studies for 21MN, 37MN, 39MN and a previous reported bivalent compound with a 21-atom spacer but different composition13 to examine whether there is any correlation between the molecular conformation and biological activity. As shown in Figure 2B, the minimized 21MN adopted an extended conformation compared to our previously reported aonalog without the piperazine in the spacer. This is in agreement with our design rationale. The distance between the N of the anchoring moiety and the methylene carbon between the two carbonyls is 20.6 and 13.8 Å for these two compounds, respectively. The distance of these two contact points in 37MN and 39MN is 24.4 and 26.9 Å, respectively. This may indicate that a distance of ~20–24 Å between these two moieties within the bivalent structure will produce the optimal protective activities.

Oxidative stress has been indicated critical roles to the observed cytotoxicity in MC65 cells upon TC removal21 and our bivalent compounds have shown antioxidant effects in this cellular model.10–15 We then next examined the antioxidative activity of these compounds and check whether there is any correlation of the antioxidative effects and the observed protective effects. Since we observed maximal protection at 0.3 µM for these bivalent compounds, we selected this concentration to investigate the antioxidative activity using the DCFH-DA assay.26 As shown in Figure 2C, upon TC removal, a significant increase of oxidative stress was observed in MC65 cells. Treatment of MC65 cells with all of these bivalent compounds at 0.3 µM led to a reduction of the oxidative stress in MC65 cells. N-acetylcystein (NAC) and trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8- tetramethyl chroman-2-carboxylic acid), two known antioxidants, were also tested as controls. Notably, trolox significantly suppressed oxidative stress under the current experimental conditions, e.g. lower than the level of normal growth conditions. On the other hand, NAC did not exhibit antioxidative activity at 8 mM concentration. Given the fact that NAC is mainly a hydrogen peroxide scavenger while trolox, a chain-breaking antioxidant, is particularly effective against lipid peroxidation within the cell membrane, these results may indicate lipid peroxidation within the cell membrane as a major contributor underlying the mechanism of Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in MC65 cells. This is in agreement with the results from Woltjer et al.27 This further supports our design rationale of using bivalent compounds with a anchoring moiety to localize into membrane system.

Our previus studies suggested the involvement of the spacer on metal chelating properties.11,13,15 Therefore, we tested these compounds for biometal binding capacity by UV-Vis spectroscopy to inverstigate how the spacer change in this series of analogs will impact such activity. Surprisingly, none of these bivalent compounds showed apparent chelating interactions with the tested biometals (Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+), as represented by 21MN and 27MN in Figure 3A (the rest spectra can be found in Suppl. Figure S2). This could be due to the fact that the presence of a piperazine ring in the spacer leads to structural constrain, as expected from our design rationale, thus limit the flexibility of spacer and binding capacity. But further studies are warranted to confirm this. Overall, the results suggest that the nature of the spacer within the bivalent compounds plays an essential role in chelating with biometals, consistent with our previous studies.11,13

Our recent studies demonstrated that the anchoring moiety also determines whether additional layer of benefits can be added to the bivalent compounds as neuroprotective agents.28 For example, bivalent compounds containing diosgenin as the anchoring moiety exhibit neuritic outgrowth activity in N2a cell, however, bivalent compounds with cholesterylamine as the anchoring moiety do not show such activity. To further confirm that this effect is mainly determined by the anchoring moiety, not by the spacer, we tested 21MN for its activity on the neuritic outgrowth of N2a cells. As shown in Figures 3B and 3C, 21MN did not show any effects on the neurite outgrowth of N2a cells compared to the control group, consistent with our reported results. This further confirmed that the curcumin and the spacer components within the bivalent structure do not exert neuritic outgrowth activity.

In summary, the studies of bivalent compounds that contain cholesterylamine as the anchoring moiety and an extended spacer demonstrated that spacer is an important component within the bivalent structure to both protective activity and biometal chelating capacity. Our results demonstrated that incorporation of a piperazine ring into the spacer design significantly improved the protective potency in the MC65 cell rescue experiments. Furthermore, our results also suggested that once the spacer reached to a length of 21 atoms, further extension of the spacer would not significantly change the protective potency. Combined with our previous studies, the results indicate that the optimal spacer length for such bivalent compounds ranges from 17 to 21 atoms, thus providing a general guidance for future design of new analogues. Metal chelating studies confirmed the essential role of the spacer component of these bivalent compounds for binding interactions. Collectively, the results from this series of bivalent compounds provide valuable information and guidance for future design and development of such bivalent compounds as potential disease modifying agents for AD.
