Objective:

Posterior cortical atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies are two distinct clinical syndromes, yet they can overlap in symptoms and occipital hypometabolism. Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies often have overlapping Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Similarly, Lewy bodies can be found in patients with posterior cortical atrophy. We investigated differences in the distribution and magnitude of F18-AV-1451 uptake between these two syndromes.

Methods:

Consecutive patients with probable dementia with Lewy bodies (n=33), posterior cortical atrophy (n=18), and cognitively unimpaired controls (n=100), underwent 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography. Regional differences in AV-1451 uptake were assessed using voxel-wise and an atlas-based approach. The greatest differences in AV-1451 uptake between patient groups were identified using the area under receiver operating curve statistics, and a composite region was derived.

Results:

AV-1451 uptake in both patient groups was predominantly localized to the lateral occipital regions, but the magnitude of uptake was markedly greater in posterior cortical atrophy compared to dementia with Lewy bodies. Posterior cortical atrophy showed the greatest AV-1451 uptake throughout the entire gray matter compared to other groups. The “occipital composite” region consisting of superior, middle and inferior occipital cortices distinguished posterior cortical atrophy from dementia with Lewy bodies (area under the curve &gt;0.97; p&lt;0.001, Bonferroni-corrected) with excellent sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%).

Conclusions:

Posterior cortical atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies can share clinical features, and although the pattern of AV-1451 uptake in occipital cortices overlaps between these two syndromes, its magnitude is significantly higher in posterior cortical atrophy.

1. Introduction

Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) present with at least one of the typical clinical features such as REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), parkinsonism, fluctuating cognitive impairment and recurrent visual hallucinations 1. Patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) often present with a prominent and progressive decline in visual-perceptual abilities such as simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and dysgraphia 2. However, an overlap can exist between DLB and PCA in symptoms, imaging findings, and underlying pathologies. Both syndromes have been associated with hypometabolism on fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) PET, localized to the occipital and temporo-parietal cortices 3–5. Cingulate island sign on FDG PET was observed in both DLB and PCA, although it was more variable and asymmetric in PCA 6. Visual hallucinations, RBD and parkinsonism can occur in PCA patients 3, 7–10, and DLB patients can develop visuospatial difficulties 11. DLB patients often have Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in addition to Lewy bodies. Most PCA patients have AD; but in subset of PCA patients, other pathologies were associated with the clinical syndrome, such as corticobasal degeneration, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or even Lewy body disease 2, 12.

Novel imaging methods such as positron emission tomography with tau tracers may potentially have a diagnostic value in distinguishing the two disorders. The objective of this study was to compare the differences in the regional distribution and magnitude of the 18F-AV-1451 uptake on PET in DLB and PCA patients. We hypothesized that although DLB patients may show AV-1451 uptake in occipital 13, 14 and posterior temporo-parietal cortical regions, similar in location to PCA patients 15, 16, the magnitude of AV-1451 uptake would be higher in PCA patients.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants

Consecutively recruited patients with probable DLB (n=33) were clinically examined by a behavioral neurologist, and underwent imaging examinations between 5/2015 and 5/2017 at the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Similarly, another sample of consecutive patients with PCA (n=18) were clinically examined by a behavioral neurologist at the Mayo Clinic Department of Neurology, underwent imaging between 8/2016 and 10/2017, and were recruited into a National Institute of Health-funded study on atypical AD. Regardless of the recruitment strategy, all patients underwent a detailed examination by a behavioral neurologist, and diagnoses were rendered based on established clinical criteria. For comparison, we selected clinically unimpaired older adults (CN; n=100), with similar age to both DLB and PCA patients from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a population-based study of aging 17. Each participant underwent neurological and neuropsychological evaluations and 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET). Participants also had 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET and MRI at 3T for anatomical labeling. Clinical evaluations and imaging visits were performed within a week from each other.

The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. All participants and/or their proxies provided a written consent to participate in this study.

PCA patients met clinical criteria for PCA 2, 3, 9. They had insidious disease onset with visual complaints in the absence of the primary ocular disease that would explain them, relatively preserved memory and insight in the early stages, progressive and disabling visual impairment and any of the following symptoms: simultanagnosia with or without oculomotor apraxia or optic ataxia, visual field defects, constructional dyspraxia, or features of Gerstmann syndrome (agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation). PCA patients were also evaluated for the presence of visual hallucinations, RBD, fluctuations, and parkinsonism.

DLB patients met the clinical criteria for probable DLB 1. The presence and severity of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), parkinsonism, visual hallucinations and fluctuations, were evaluated according to the 4th Consortium Criteria for DLB 1. Simultanagnosia was not specifically tested in DLB patients, and symptoms such as optic ataxia or oculomotor apraxia or elements of Gerstmann syndrome were evaluated during the clinical neurologic examination. Onset and duration of the specific features and dementia were ascertained during an interview between the attending physician and patient with an informant.

Clinically unimpaired controls were independent functioning and performed within the normal range on tests covering four cognitive domains (executive, memory, language, visuospatial). The raw score from each test was transformed into age-adjusted score using established normative data from the Mayo Clinic’s Older Americans Normative Studies 18 on the participants from the same population. Participants scoring 1.0 SD or more than the age-specific mean in the general population were considered to have possible cognitive impairment 19. The final decision on normal cognition was established during a consensus after taking into account visual or hearing deficits, education, prior occupation, and reviewing all other information on the participant.

2.2 PET acquisition

Tau PET was performed using the 18F-AV-1451 tracer and amyloid PET was performed using 11C-PiB tracer on a PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare; Milwaukee, Wisconsin) operating in 3D mode 13. For AV-1451, an intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370MBq (range 330–406 MBq) of AV-1451 was administered, followed by an 80 minutes uptake period, and a 20 minute scan scan of four 5-minute dynamic frames. For PiB, an injection of approximately 627 MBq (range 384–722 MBq) of PiB was administered, followed by a 40 minutes uptake period, and a 20 minute scan of four 5-minute dynamic frames. AV-1451 and PiB scans were visually inspected for the technical quality including an excessive motion by a trained PET technician.

For anatomical segmentation and labeling of PET images, a T1-weighted 3-dimensional high-resolution magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo sequence was performed on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (General Electric Healthcare; Waukesha, Wisconsin) with an eight channel phased array head coil.

2.3 PET analysis

An automated image processing pipeline for PET image analysis included registration of the PET volumes to each patient’s own T1‐weighted MRI for the segmentation of gray and white matter. Regional AV-1451 uptake was calculated by transforming the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) 20 with an in-house modified 122-region Automated Anatomic Labeling atlas 21 into the native space of each T1‐weighted MRI using Advanced Normalization Tools software 22 implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)12. MCALT is a publicly-available population-matched brain template (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt/) 23. The Automated Anatomic Labeling atlas has been modified to fit our MCALT template in SPM12. Fraction of tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compartments in each PET voxel were derived from the registered T1‐weighted MRI. Correction for partial volume averaging of the CSF was performed using the two‐compartment model 24. AV‐1451 uptake in each voxel was divided by the median value of the right and left cerebellar crus uptake 25. Cerebellar crus region corresponded to bilateral crus 1 and crus 2 in the AAL atlas 21.

For PiB uptake, the global cortical retention standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated from the bilateral parietal (including posterior cingulate and precuneus), orbitofrontal, prefrontal, temporal, and anterior cingulate regions, referenced to the right and left cerebellar crus 26.

Group-wise differences in magnitude of AV-1451 uptake were assessed using voxel-wise and atlas-based approach. Whereas the voxel-wise analysis was exploratory to show the range and pattern of AV-1451 uptake differences, especially between the PCA and DLB groups, the purpose of atlas-based analysis was to identify the region(s) with the greatest differences between PCA and DLB with a potential to differentiate between the two clinical groups. Comparisons were performed with and without correction for partial volume averaging of CSF. Because the findings were consistent between the two approaches, partial volume corrected data are reported.

Voxel‐based differences in AV-1451 uptake were assessed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM12). Maps showing the between-group differences were displayed using two-sided t-test at p&lt;0.001 and cluster extent threshold &gt;25.

Using atlas-based approach, we first calculated regional asymmetries in AV-1451 uptake by subtracting right regional SUVR from left regional SUVR in 46 gray matter regions from the in-house optimized AAL atlas and MCALT template described above. Because we did not identify any asymmetry between any two of clinical groups, AV-1451 uptake from left and right side region was combined together.

To identify gray matter regions with the greatest differences in AV-1451 uptake between the clinical groups, the area under curve (AUC) statistics was calculated for each individual gray matter region. Regions were ranked from highest to lowest AUC. Because multiple regions were compared, the Bonferroni correction was used at p&lt;0.001. Our objective was to select regions with AUROC above the certain threshold, at p&lt;0.001 and Bonferroni-corrected, and combine these into a “composite region” that would show the greatest differences in AV-1451 uptake between the PCA and DLB group.

2.5 Statistics

Participants’ characteristics at the time of imaging were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD) or proportions (%). Continuous variables were compared across the groups using analysis of variance, followed by a priori chosen contrasts for pair-wise comparisons between the DLB vs PCA groups. Categorical variables were compared across the groups using chi-squared test or logistic regression between the PCA and DLB group. Area under the receiver operating curve statistics along with sensitivity and specificity was calculated to measure the accuracy of the “occipital composite” AV-1451 uptake to distinguish between the DLB and PCA groups. The same calculation was performed for the global cortical PiB SUVR. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and R statistical software version 3.1.1 (R project.org).

3. Results

3.1 Participants’ characteristics

Demographic, clinical and basic imaging characteristics at the time of imaging are summarized in Table 1. Eighty five percent of DLB patients were men, whereas sixty-one percent of PCA patients were women. Controls were of similar age to the DLB and PCA groups, and did not differ in sex distribution from either patient group. Simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, ocular apraxia, Gerstmann syndrome, visual field deficits or hemi neglect were more frequent in PCA patients. Similarly; RBD, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations and fluctuations were more frequent in patients with DLB. Symptoms typical for PCA were not manifested in DLB patients on neurological examination.

Four PCA patients had clinically described sleep disorder that was consistent with RBD at the time of imaging (Table 1). One of these four PCA patients had isolated RBD. One PCA patient had RBD and visual hallucinations. One PCA patient had RBD, visual hallucinations and also mild parkinsonism. One had RBD and fluctuations. These PCA patients would additionally meet the clinical criteria for possible or even probable DLB. Additional DLB clinical features in patients with PCA were present at the imaging visit. However, all four PCA patients with additional DLB clinical features initially presented with typical PCA symptoms, not with DLB symptoms, and were diagnosed as having PCA not DLB.

All PCA patients had elevated PiB uptake (mean PiB SUVR=2.36; SD=0.39). However, two patients had lower PiB SUVR (1.51 and 1.56) compared to other PCA patients. These two also had the lowest AV-1451 uptake among all PCA patients, supporting the notion that there might be other etiologies contributing to clinical symptoms in addition to their mild AD pathology. These two PCA patients were carefully evaluated during multiple visits, and no other clinical features suggesting for example corticobasal syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or other known etiology were observed. For comparison, mean PiB SUVR in DLB patients was 1.69; SD=0.45, and =1.36; SD=0.07 in controls.

3.2 Voxel-wise differences in AV-1451 uptake

Figure 1 illustrates the pattern of regional differences in cortical AV-1451 uptake between the clinical groups. PCA patients had markedly higher AV-1451 uptake across the entire cortex compared to DLB, with the greatest differences in the lateral occipital association cortices: superior, middle and inferior occipital gyri. No regions were identified where DLB patients showed a higher AV-1451 uptake compared to PCA patients. As expected, PCA patients showed markedly higher AV-1451 uptake across the entire cortex compared to controls. DLB patients showed only modest differences in AV-1451 uptake compared to controls, scattered in temporal, parietal, occipital and also frontal cortices.

3.3 Atlas-based differences in magnitude of AV-1451 uptake

Figure 2 (top) shows the differences in AV-1451 uptake between the PCA and DLB group, expressed as AUC for the individual gray matter regions. AUC are ranked from the highest to the lowest. The highest ranking regions with AUC &gt;0.97 were lateral occipital association cortices (superior, middle and inferior occipital), and these regions were combined into the “occipital composite”, taking the median SUVR from the entire composite (overall AUC &gt;0.97). Although the cut off AUC at &gt;0.97 was arbitrary, the occipital regions selected into this composite were consistent with regions showing the greatest differences in AV-1451 uptake between PCA and DLB in our voxel-wise analysis.

Figure 2 (bottom) shows that the mean AV-1451 uptake in the “occipital composite” in PCA (mean SUVR=2.75; SD=0.68) was significantly higher than in DLB (p&lt;0.001; mean SUVR=1.18; SD=0.10) and controls (p&lt;0.001; mean SUVR=1.10, SD=0.08). Among the four PCA patients who had additional DLB clinical feature(s), the lowest “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR was 2.26, whereas among all DLB patients, the highest “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR was 1.42. Therefore, all DLB patients could be separated from PCA patients with additional DLB features by the “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR.

Figure 3 shows imaging findings that were: 1) typical within the DLB and PCA groups; 2) less typical in the two PCA patients with low PiB uptake and low “occipital composite” AV-1451 uptake; 3) all four PCA patients with additional DLB clinical features.

3.4. Distinguishing DLB and PCA patients using AV-1451 uptake in the “occipital composite” region

Figure 4 shows the discrimination between the PCA and DLB groups using the receiver operating characteristics curves with associated AUROC for the “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR. Because elevated PiB uptake is common in PCA patients and also in many DLB patients, we included global PiB SUVR as a comparison for distinguishing among the two clinical groups. The accuracy of “occipital composite” AV-1451 uptake in distinguishing the PCA from DLB group was &gt;0.97, whereas the accuracy of cortical PiB SUVR was 0.87. At various step-wise sensitivity levels (Figure 4), the specificity of the “occipital composite” AV-1451 was higher compared to the global cortical PiB SUVR.

4. Discussion

We studied AV-1451 uptake in clinically diagnosed PCA and clinically probable DLB patients from two consecutive samples using the standard clinical diagnostic criteria for both syndromes. For comparison, cognitively unimpaired controls were selected from a population-based sample. We demonstrated that PCA patients had markedly higher AV-1451 uptake on PET across the entire cortex compared to DLB patients and controls. In PCA patients, AV-1451 uptake was higher especially in the lateral occipital association cortices compared to DLB patients. Based on the voxel-based and subsequent atlas-based analysis, we identified the “occipital composite” cortical region with the greatest difference in AV-1451 uptake between PCA and DLB patients. Four PCA patients had DLB features in addition to cardinal PCA features at the time of imaging. The AV-1451 uptake in the “occipital composite” was higher in all four PCA patients compared to any DLB patient. In the discrimination analysis using AUROC, the “occipital composite” AV-1451 uptake distinguished PCA from DLB patients with excellent sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%). Overall, AV-1451 PET imaging shows significant differences between DLB and PCA patients, including the occasional PCA patients who have overlapping DLB clinical features with the PCA features.

The pattern of AV-1451 uptake in DLB patients 13, 14, 27 and PCA 15, 16, 28 compared to cognitively unimpaired controls have been described by us and other groups; with an uptake in the bilateral occipital and to some extent also posterior temporo-parietal cortices in both syndromes, and significant uptake in the lateral temporal and frontal cortices in PCA. In the current study, we compared differences in AV-1451 uptake between PCA and DLB patients since these two syndromes can overlap in clinical symptoms and imaging findings.

We found substantially higher AV-1451 uptake throughout the entire cortex in PCA patients compared to DLB, with findings consistent between the voxel-wise and atlas-based analysis. The greatest differences between DLB and PCA patients were seen in the lateral occipital association cortices, combined into the “occipital composite” region. Except for the two atypical PCA patients with relatively low AV-1451 and low PiB uptake, the separation between DLB and PCA groups was complete with the “occipital composite”AV-1451 uptake.

Although the differences in AV-1451 uptake were expected, the magnitude of these differences was significant. High AV-1451 uptake in our PCA patients agrees with the notion that AD pathology is the most frequent cause of PCA 2, 9, 29. On the other hand, many DLB patients also have varying degrees of AD pathology in addition to Lewy body disease 30, 31. Despite this overlap, the differences in AV-1451 uptake between PCA and DLB were substantial. We included a consecutive sample for both PCA and DLB patients to account for various possible underlying etiologies, especially in PCA patients. However, all PCA patients from the current sample had elevated PiB and AV-1451 uptake levels. In two PCA patients with lower, although still elevated levels of global PiB SUVR and the “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR, we did not identify any other underlying etiologies based on available clinical data.

AV-1451 tracer binds to the same tau strains in PCA patients and DLB 32. However, the AV-1451 tracer does not completely reflect the early stage tau progression suggested by Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging, particularly in atypical forms of AD. Both PCA and DLB have shown atypical patterns of tau deposition that do not fit the traditional Braak staging scheme 33, 34. Should other pathologies be present in our PCA patients, such as TAR DNA-binding protein-43, or corticobasal degeneration, they would likely diminish the differences in AV-1451 uptake between PCA and DLB but not vice versa.

Interestingly, four PCA patients had overlapping RBD alone or in combination with other DLB clinical features at the time of imaging. However, the AV-1451 uptake in the “occipital composite” was still significantly higher in all four of these PCA patients with additional DLB features than in any probable DLB patient. DLB features in these four PCA patients could be explained by the presence of Lewy body pathology in addition to AD pathology 35. RBD is strongly suggestive of alpha-synucleinopathy 36. However, patients with presumed or definite AD can rarely also have RBD and other DLB symptoms 37 as a result of AD pathology with the neuronal loss in the vulnerable regions such as the substantia nigra. The definite substrate underlying RBD in these rare cases however remains unclear 38, 39. On the other hand, co-occurrence of Lewy body pathology in addition to dominant AD pathology was the least frequent in hippocampal-sparing AD cases as compared to typical AD and limbic-predominant cases in a large autopsy-confirmed cohort 33. Clinical PCA would be the most consistent with autopsy-confirmed hippocampal-sparing AD. Overall, our PCA patients with additional DLB clinical features likely have AD as the primary underlying etiology of PCA, and it is also possible they have Lewy body disease in addition to AD.

The overall accuracy of the “occipital composite” AV-1451 uptake in distinguishing between PCA and DLB patients was excellent, with 100% specificity at a sensitivity of 88%. This finding can be useful in the differential diagnosis and management of patients PCA and DLB. As expected, accuracy and specificity of global cortical PiB uptake was lower, since many DLB patients have an elevated uptake on PiB PET 40.

A limitation of the current study is that polysomnography was not routinely performed in all PCA patients who had REM sleep behavior disorder symptoms, and RBD was recorded based on clinical evaluation. Another limitation is that not all specific PCA-related symptoms were measured in all patients, i.e. simultanagnosia was not measured in DLB patients. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that regional differences in AV-1451 uptake were contributed by different stages of clinical progression in the PCA and DLB group. Although our DLB and PCA groups did not differ on MOCA or CDR-SOB scales, these measures assessing the global clinical severity are perhaps not the most optimal measures to compare the severity of the two clinical syndromes. Despite these limitations, the striking differences in AV-1451 uptake between DLB and PCA patients demonstrate the diagnostic value of AV-1451 PET imaging in these two syndromes with occasionally overlapping symptoms.

1. DLB with low AV-1451 SUVR, a 78-years old right-handed male. As expected, he has low “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR = 1.02. Global PiB SUVR=1.45. He has parkinsonism, RBD, visual hallucinations, fluctuations.

2. DLB with high AV-1451 SUVR, an 82-years old right-handed male with high “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR=1.42 compared to other DLB patients in the study. Global PiB SUVR=1.46. He has parkinsonism and RBD but no visual hallucinations or fluctuations.

3. PCA with high AV-1451 SUVR, a 59-years old right-handed male with a high “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR=3.76, and global PiB SUVR=2.52. He presented with profound visuospatial deficits; severe simultanagnosia and also mild problems with memory. He does not have RBD, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations or fluctuations.

4. PCA with low AV-1451 SUVR, a 76-years old right-handed female with low “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR=1.45. Global PiB SUVR is also low =1.56 compared to other PCA patients. She presented with a primary progressive alexia and severe visuo-perceptual impairment. She did not have any DLB features or features suggestive of corticobasal syndrome, frontotemporal dementia or Creutzfeltd-Jakob disease.

5. PCA with low AV-1451 SUVR, a 73-years old right-handed female, with “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR=1.31, global PiB SUVR=1.51; severe Gerstmann syndrome, constructional dyspraxia and mild executive weakness and simultanagnosia.

6. PCA with RBD and visual hallucinations, a 57-years old left-handed female with “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR=3.00 and global PiB SUVR= 2.02; with simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and partial Gerstmann syndrome.

7. PCA with RBD, visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, a 58-years old right-handed female with “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR= 3.27 and global PiB SUVR= 2.79, simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and Gerstmann syndrome.

8. PCA with RBD is 71-years old right-handed male with “occipital composite” AV-1451 SUVR= 2.72 and global PiB SUVR= 2.45. He has severe visuospatial impairment and simultanagnosia.

9. PCA with RBD and fluctuations, a 68-years old right handed male with “occipital composite” AV-1451= 2.26 and global PiB SUVR= 2.48. He presented with quadrantanopia, progressive aphasia and working memory problems.

Figure 4. Discrimination between PCA and DLB using the “occipital composite” region AV-1451 uptake

Discrimination between DLB and PCA patients using AV-1451 uptake from the “occipital composite”. For comparison, cortical PiB uptake is used. The accuracy of the “occipital composite” AV-1451 uptake to distinguish between the DLB and PCA patients corresponds to area under the receiver operating curve=0.97. The accuracy of the cortical PiB uptake to distinguish between groups corresponds to area under the receiver operating curve=0.87.

* p-values for differences between groups come from an ANOVA for the continuous variables or a chi-squared test for the categorical variables.

** p-values for differences between groups are contrasts from an ANOVA for the continuous variables or logistic regression for the categorical variables. Abbreviations: CN-cognitively unimpaired adults; DLB-dementia with Lewy bodies; PCA-posterior cortical atrophy; SUVR-standardized uptake value ratio; CDR-SOB-Clinical Dementia Rating, sum of boxes; MMSE-Mini Mental State Examination; MoCA-Montreal Cognitive Assessment; RBD-REM sleep behavior disorder. The features presented in table are related to image acquisition and not to the time of disease onset.

† First PCA patient with RBD also had visual hallucinations and parkinsonism. Second PCA patient with RDB had also visual hallucinations. Third PCA patient with RBD had also fluctuations. Fourth PCA patient had isolated RBD without other DLB clinical features.

§ Information on visual field deficits and hemi neglect was not available in two PCA patients.
