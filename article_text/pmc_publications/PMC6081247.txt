Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) differ in basic emotional tone, and skin conduction levels (SCLs), a measure of sympathetic tone, may be a sensitive test for discriminating these two dementias early in their course. Prior research has shown differences in resting SCLs between patients with bvFTD and AD, but has not evaluated the discriminability of SCLs during different environmental conditions. We compared 8 bvFTD patients, 10 AD patients, and 9 healthy controls (HCs) on SCL measures to real-life vignettes or scenarios differing in valence and emotional intensity. The SCLs among the bvFTD patients were decreased across all conditions, whereas the SCLs among the AD patients were increased compared to HCs. On analysis of area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (auROC), the SCLs to emotional stimuli differentiated bvFTD from AD with an auROC of 95.3%. At a cut-off of ≤0.77 μS, emotional vignettes distinguished bvFTD from AD with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 96%. These preliminary results indicate the potential utility of SCLs for differentiating bvFTD from AD early in their course regardless of environmental condition.

INTRODUCTION

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common young-onset neurodegenerative dementia, after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (1, 2). The differentiation of bvFTD from young-onset AD has implications for prognosis, genetic considerations, and pharmacological management (3, 4). Although these dementias usually have distinct clinical characteristics and criteria, involving early behavioral and language changes in bvFTD and episodic memory in AD, they can overlap and be difficult to distinguish. Examples include situations where there is prominent memory impairment in bvFTD (5, 6), and when there are neuropsychiatric features early in the course of AD (7, 8). The overlap of clinical symptoms and the lack of definitive biomarkers confounds the problem of differential diagnosis. There is clearly a need for an effective clinical test that can distinguish bvFTD from AD early in the course.

Differences in emotional or autonomic state in these two dementias can serve as the basis of a clinical test. Given mesiofrontal and anterior temporal pathology, emotional blunting is among the earliest and most characteristic feature of bvFTD (9, 10), and bvFTD patients have prominent impairments in empathy and sympathy (2). They may have particular problems in recognizing emotions with a negative valence as opposed to a positive valence (11, 12). In sharp contrast to bvFTD, patients with early AD can have increased emotional reactivity and anxiety (13, 14). Anxiety, and an associated heightened sympathetic state, may be particularly associated with young-onset AD (15, 16), and in the first stages of their disease (17, 18).

Skin conductance levels (SCLs) reflect autonomic and emotional tone and could be a good clinical test for differentiating between bvFTD and AD early in their course. SCLs are a direct measure of ongoing, tonic sympathetic activity and a readily accessible psychophysiological index of emotional tone. Our prior research has shown that patients with bvFTD, compared to those with AD and healthy controls (HCs), have decreased resting SCLs, which correlate with emotional blunting, and that their average SCLs may be more likely to be abnormal than the more commonly assayed peak, phasic skin conduction responses to discrete events (19). In contrast, patients with AD may have increased sympathetic tone, possibly from retained insight or decreased sensorimotor gating associated with AD pathology in the entorhinal cortex (20).

This study investigated average SCLs as a measure of emotional tone during video and audio presentation of real-life vignettes among patients with bvFTD and AD compared to HCs. Impairments on psychophysiological measures have varied with the valence (positive or negative outcomes) and emotionality (present or absent emotional paralinguistic cues) of stimuli (21, 22). Investigating SCLs to scenarios varying in valence and emotion builds on our prior research showing baseline resting SCL differences between bvFTD and AD (19). In order to determine goodness of the SCLs as a predictive test for the binary classification of bvFTD vs. AD, this study determined the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) for mean SCLs. We hypothesized that the bvFTD patients would have significantly lower SCLs, particularly to negative or emotional scenarios, and that the AD patients would have heightened SCLs to these vignettes, thus distinguishing the two dementias.

METHODS

Participants

BvFTD and young-onset AD patients were recruited from the UCLA Behavioral Neurology Program and Clinic where they underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments. Age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from volunteers in the community. Under approval by the Institutional Review Board of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), this study enrolled 27 participants: 8 patients with bvFTD, 10 patients with young-onset AD, and 9 HCs. All participants and their caregivers gave informed consent.

The patients with bvFTD met International Consensus Criteria for clinically probable bvFTD (2). Clinical diagnoses were supported by predominant frontal and/or anterior temporal involvement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). Patients with AD met National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for clinically probable AD. HC participants did not have any known history of neurological or psychiatric disease.

Participants in all three groups were comparable in age: AD patients were in early stages of disease and age-matched with the bvFTD patients within three years. Disease severity was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In order to further document differences in socioemotional behavior between bvFTD and AD patients, we administered three behavioral scales that characterize the behavioral deficits of bvFTD: The Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), the Social Dysfunction Scale (SDS), and the Scale for Emotional Blunting (SEB). Exclusion criteria included the use of beta-blocker medications (because of the psychophysiological assessment) or the presence of complicating medical or psychiatric illnesses or medications at the time of participation.

Procedures

Presentation Vignettes

Four types of vignettes were designed to vary in either positive or negative outcomes (valence) and in emotional or unemotional presentations. The four vignettes were 1. “Tumor” (“I saw my doctor today. Remember the tests I had done last week? Results came back and ….”); 2. “Accident” (“…There was a big car accident on the freeway and grandpa’s car went off the bridge!…”); 3. “Missing” (Jane didn’t come home from school yesterday. I looked for her everywhere.,,,”; and “Soldier” (“I spoke with someone from the Army today. My [deployed] brother,,,lucky to not have any injuries…”). Each of these opening vignettes was followed by one of two potential outcomes (e.g., for “Tumor”, the test result were negative or positive for cancer). Each of these vignettes (opening and outcome) was delivered by the actor with either an emotional presentation or with a flat and nonemotional presentation.

The emotional vs. unemotional delivery of these vignettes required variation in the methodology of delivery. The verbatim same stories were presented with either emotion (visual [video] and voice [audio]) or non-emotion (visual [neutral portrait] and voice [audio]) content. The emotional presentations included video (facial) paralinguistic cues portrayed by the actor, and the accompanying audio included (voice) emotional prosody. The unemotional presentations included a portrait of a neutral facial expression of the actor, and the accompanying audio included a flat voice with a flat emotional tone.

The experiments with the presentation of vignettes and SCL measurements were conducted in a quiet testing room. All vignettes were performed by the same actor (MMA) and programmed and presented through SuperLab Pro 4.0 software with audio through headphones. Immediately prior to the experiment, participants were instructed to relax and remain still for a 2.5-minute baseline skin conductance recording. Following this baseline period, the vignettes were presented on a television monitor to participants seated approximately 3 feet away. To minimize possible effects of attention and working memory deficits, the vignettes were kept short, at 30 seconds each. To control for order and carry-over effects, the vignettes were randomized using a random integer sequence generator (www.random.org) into three different counterbalanced presentation sequences. Each participant received one of the three counterbalanced presentation sequences. The experimenter directly monitored the visual gaze of each participant, in order to assure that they were focused on the monitor.

On debriefing, all participants were asked to identify the content of the vignettes and whether they were “emotional” or “unemotional”. There were no errors in vignette comprehension.

Psychophysiology

Skin conductance was continuously recorded using BIOPAC hardware (MP150 System) with the skin conductance module (GSR 100C) and BIOPAC software (AcqKnowledge v4.1). Electrodermal electrodes were placed on the palmar surface of the index and middle fingers of the participant’s right hand. Acquisition parameters were set at 5 μS/V, low pass filter 1Hz with no high pass filter. The sampling rate was 31.25Hz. The average SCLs (continuous changes in tonic skin conductance levels) were determined for each individual during each vignette presentation and analyzed at one-second intervals. The average SCLs for the 30 seconds of exposure for each vignette were then computed for each individual.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 23.0 software. Demographic descriptive statistics were generated for each group and compared using Chi-square and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. The SCLs were evaluated for normality with Shapiro-Wilks analysis; all between groups and within groups SCLs were significantly positively skewed and lacked normality. Accordingly, group differences in SCLs across the three groups were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis nonparametic analysis. In addition, as recommended for obtaining normal distributions of skin conduction measures (23), the log of the SCLs (logSCLs) were obtained and group differences across the three groups were further analyzed with ANOVA. Post-hoc analyses of pairwise comparisons were done with Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) and Tukey tests. Spearman correlations were computed to examine the relations between SCLs and behavioral scales. Finally, this study determined the auROC values, which represent true positives (sensitivity) vs. false positives (1-sensitivity) across the range of possible classification cutoffs. They were compared using the confidence interval adjustment set at 95%. The Youdin Index of maximum sensitivity determined the best SCR cutoff score for distinguishing bvFTD from AD.

RESULTS

Participant characteristics

There were no significant group differences on demographic variables of age, sex, or years of education (See Table 1). The dementia groups did not differ on disease duration, the MMSE, or the MoCA. As expected, both the bvFTD (p=0.024) and the AD (p=0.005) patients differed significantly from HCs on the MMSE. On further analysis, there were no significant correlations between the two dementia scales and the average SCLs, either within or across groups.

Behavioral assessments and correlations

The bvFTD and AD groups differed significantly on the three behavioral scales, the FrSBe (p=0.001), SDS (p&lt;0.001), and SEB (p=0.004), indicating worse socioemotional behavioral function among the bvFTD patients (See Table 1). There were no significant correlations between the socioemotional behavioral scale results and the average SCLs either within or across groups.

Psychophysiology

Part A

The mean SCLs in μS for the three groups, and for their responses to vignettes differing in valence and emotional presentation, did not differ between the dementia patients and the HCs. Despite the smaller SCLs among the bvFTD patients compared to the AD patients, the mean SCL differences in total, Positive valence, Negative valence, Emotional, and Unemotional SCLs between the bvFTD and AD groups did not reach statistical significance (all Kruskal-Wallis test n.s.) (See Table 2).

The mean logSCLs differed significantly between the three groups (ANOVA; p&lt;.001) (See Table 3). On post-hoc comparisons, there were significant differences between the bvFTD and AD groups (both LSD and Tukey p=0.037), AD and HC groups (both LSD and Tukey p=0.034), and bvFTD and HC groups (both LSD and Tukey p=0.038). There were no interactions between group, valence, and emotional content. Further analysis did not show differences between the four types of vignettes.

Part B

The auROC values were calculated from sensitivities and 1-specificities across all four conditions and for each of the four conditions separately (See Figure 1). The areas under the curve ranged from 91.0-95.3%, with 93% for all conditions combined, and with the largest auROC elicited from emotional vignettes (See Table 4). AuROC values were reviewed for individual vignettes in order to determine which stimulus category rendered the most discriminating Youdin Index. The Youdin Indexes were calculated, and a cut-off of ≤ 0.77-0.78 μS gave the highest value for Emotional presentation (0.814). The other Youdin Indices were: Positive valence (0.792), Negative valence (0.711), and Unemotional presentation (0.709). Overall, the maximum differentiation involved SCLs to vignettes with Emotional presentations with a cutoff of ≤ 0.773 μS yielding a sensitivity of 0.857 and a specificity of 0.957 for differentiating bvFTD and AD.

DISCUSSION

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, the two most common neurodegenerative dementias of the presenium, are easily distinguished with SCLs, a measure of sympathetic and emotional tone. Patients with bvFTD have prominent emotional blunting (24), and those with early AD may be prone to anxiety and increased emotional reactivity (15). Using this distinction, this preliminary study shows that SCLs to emotional vignettes can differentiate patients with bvFTD, who have low SCLs, from those with AD, who may have high SCLs, at a cut-off of ≤ 0.773 μS with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 96%. Presenting an emotional scenario to these young-onset neurodegenerative dementias while measuring SCLs is a promising, clinically accessible measure for differentiating bvFTD from AD.

The correct diagnosis of bvFTD or young-onset AD is critical, not only for clinical management, but also clinical trial enrollment, genetic analysis, and the understanding of these disorders (3, 4). The differential diagnosis may be difficult when the presentations vary from the established behaviorally-predominant criteria for bvFTD (2), and the cognitive features and criteria for AD (25). Clinicians may misdiagnose bvFTD as AD in the presence of significant deficits in episodic declarative memory (5, 6), which is relatively spared in Consensus Criteria for bvFTD (2). Conversely, clinicians may misdiagnose AD as bvFTD in the presence of agitation or aggression, hallucinations, or delusions (7, 8), particularly early in the course. In one large neuropathological study, 22% of clinically diagnosed bvFTD patients were found to have AD on autopsy, having been misdiagnosed because of the presence of early neuropsychiatric symptoms (7). A third risk for misdiagnosis is the occurrence of an AD frontal variant, best characterized as the “behavioral/dysexecutive” variant of AD, a form of AD often meeting Consensus Criteria for clinically probable bvFTD (26). Finally, there are no definitive clinical tests for these disorders. Early in the course of bvFTD, fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans can be normal (27), and, in AD, amyloid PET may be costly and fail to correlate with the presence of disease state whereas tau PET is not yet clinically available.

A readily accessible, noninvasive test of tonic emotional state, such as SCLs, can effectively discriminate between bvFTD and AD. Emotional blunting and related deficits characterize patients with bvFTD early in their course and correlate with their mesiofrontal-limbic and associated anterior insular and temporal pathology (9, 10). Patients with bvFTD have impairments in emotion recognition and understanding (12, 28–31), empathic concern (32), emotion regulation (33, 34), and affective Theory of Mind, or the ability to infer the emotions and feelings of others (35–38). In contrast, patients with mild AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD can have increased anxiety, emotional reactivity, or even affective disturbance, reflecting the beginning stages of their disease (15, 18, 39, 40). These symptoms in AD may reflect the presence of the earliest Alzheimer pathology in the entorhinal cortex, with consequent impairment in sensorimotor gating (20).

Although not statistical significance, the largest auROC group differences occurred with emotional presentations. Valence represents the positive versus negative significance of an emotional presentation, and emotional intensity corresponds to the paralinguistic and prosody cues that convey emotion. Not surprisingly, the emotional presentations showed the largest discriminability in SCLs between the patients with bvFTD and those with AD.

This study has limitations. First there are a relatively small number of participants, raising concern for sampling bias or a lack of representativeness of the bvFTD and AD patients. The findings showing the value of SCLs for the differential diagnosis of these two dementias needs replication in a larger investigation. Second, all the bvFTD and AD diagnoses are clinical; there is no neuropathological verification of the diagnosis. Third, there are no statistically significant differences across valence and emotional stimulus categories. Although the methodology did not show statistically worse SCLs for emotional vs. unemotional between bvFTD and AD, the largest auROC group differences with emotional presentations supports the main hypothesis and as well as the potential value of SCLs in differentiating these two young-onset dementias. Finally, the emotional presentations included video presentations of an actor demonstrating behavioral cues of emotion, whereas the unemotional presentations involved projecting a static, neutral portrait of the actor. Despite this design, there were no significant ANOVA differences when comparing the effects of emotional vs. unemotional presentation on the SCLs.

In conclusion, SCL differences can be a simple clinical test for distinguishing patients with early bvFTD from those with early AD, particularly of young-onset. SCLs are readily available, inexpensive, and noninvasive measures of emotional state, which is blunted in bvFTD and often exaggerated in early AD. Further research is necessary to corroborate these findings in a larger sample of participants with these dementias.
