Objective:

This study examined the utility of the Chinese-language translations of the word list memory test (Philadelphia Verbal Learning Test) and story memory test (Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale) for differentiating cognitive diagnosis in older U.S. Chinese immigrants.

Methods:

Participants were ≥ 60 years old, with Chinese language proficiency to complete a diagnostic work-up at the Mount Sinai’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. The work-up included an evaluation by a geriatric psychiatrist and cognitive testing with a psychometrician. Diagnosis of normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia was made independent of the cognitive tests at consensus led by a dementia expert physician. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the sensitivity of story and word list memory tests for distinguishing between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC area/AUC) was used to compare the predictive accuracy of the two tests.

Results:

The sample included 71 participants with normal cognition, 42 with MCI, and 24 with dementia. The MCI group was older and less educated than normal controls, but younger and more educated than the dementia group. Delayed recall of both memory tests, but not immediate recall of either test, predicted diagnosis. While composite memory score of word list (AUC =0.90) predicted diagnosis slightly better than that of stories (AUC=0.85), the difference was not significant in this small sample (p=0.14).

Conclusion:

Chinese-language translations of verbal memory tests, in particular delayed recall scores, were equally sensitive for classifying cognitive diagnosis in older U.S. Chinese immigrants.

pmcINTRODUCTION

A sensitive assessment of memory is a crucial goal in neuropsychological evaluation of dementia. Verbal memory is generally considered as the most sensitive predictor of cognitive decline (Arnaiz &amp; Almkvist, 2003; Belleville et al., 2017). Word list and story memory tests are commonly used measures of verbal memory (Rabin et al., 2016). These measures are widely used to identify memory impairment and track cognitive and functional changes over time among older adults, especially those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia (Ashendorf et al., 2018; Fleisher et al., 2007; Gavett et al., 2010; Gavett et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2003). A decline in memory performance is particularly prevalent in individuals who are at risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD)(Jessen, 2014; Summers &amp; Saunders, 2012). Over the last few decades, numerous word list tests have been developed (Gavett et al., 2016). Most provide multiple learning trials to measure immediate recall, commonly conceptualized as the learning/encoding process. Following the learning trials, delayed recall trials with various lengths of delay intervals and a recognition trial are given. These word list tests, in their various formats, have been shown to differentiate among normal aging, MCI, and dementia with good sensitivity and specificity (Estevez-Gonzalez et al., 2003; Gavett et al., 2016; Kaltreider et al., 2000; Karrasch et al., 2005; Kuslansky et al., 2004; Lacritz et al., 2001; Rabin et al., 2009). Among the story memory tests, Logical Memory test from different editions of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), is one of the most common. The test includes two short stories, with an immediate recall/learning, delayed recall, and recognition trial. This test has been shown to effectively identify older adults with MCI and dementia (Rubin et al., 1998; Storandt &amp; Hill, 1989; Weissberger et al., 2017) and has been used as a measure of memory function in many large-scale longitudinal studies (Chapman et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2003; Weintraub et al., 2009).

A number of studies have compared story with word lists and reported that word list memory tests were more sensitive for distinguishing MCI and dementia from normal aging and for predicting conversion from MCI to dementia in English-speaking older adults (Mansbach et al., 2014; Rabin et al., 2009). Similar findings were reported among older adult populations in urban India (Tripathi et al., 2015), Europe (Silva et al., 2012), and Korea (Baek et al., 2012). Other studies compared diagnostic performance of learning scores with recall scores on verbal memory tests. In general, delayed recall performance has demonstrated adequate diagnostic accuracy to detect MCI and dementia (Hogervorsta et al., 2002; Weissberger et al., 2017) and to detect preclinical cognitive deficits (Bäckman et al., 2005). Learning scores for both story and word list memory tests, in comparison to delayed recall scores, were found to be more sensitive for detecting dementia in some studies (Albert et al., 2001; Rabin et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2012), but were considered less sensitive in other studies (Hogervorsta et al., 2002) and in meta-analyses (Bäckman et al., 2005; Weissberger et al., 2017). However, it is unclear if findings from these previous studies can be generalized to U.S. immigrant populations. To date, there has been a dearth of studies investigating the types of memory measures that can best distinguish cognitive diagnosis among older Chinese immigrants with little to no English competency. Using a cohort of linguistically and culturally diverse older Chinese immigrants residing in New York, one of our early studies examined the use of a Chinese-language cognitive test battery for differentiating cognitive diagnostic groups (Li et al., 2019). The prior study used the Chinese-language translations of story and word memory list tests to generate a memory composite score for evaluating cognitive impairment in older Chinese immigrants. In this current study, we aim (1) to determine if Chinese-language translations of both story and word list memory tests independently can differentiate between normal aging, MCI, and dementia, and (2) to compare predictive accuracy of each of the two verbal memory subtests, including immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

A total of 210 older Chinese immigrants were enrolled into the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS) using community-based recruitment procedures, described in depth elsewhere (Li et al., 2016). Briefly, the cohort was recruited to assess the feasibility of evaluating older U.S. Chinese immigrants using a battery of Chinese-language translations of cognitive tests (Li et al., 2019). Inclusion criteria of the pilot study were 60 years old or above, Chinese immigrants residing in New York, and self-reported as native Mandarin/Cantonese speakers with adequate Chinese language proficiency and sensorimotor capacity to complete the cognitive test battery. Participants who were self-identified as primarily English speakers or non-Mandarin/Cantonese speaking, as well as had active substance abuse, a major psychotic disorder, sensory impairment, or an active mood disorder that would likely impede cognitive assessment, were excluded from the study. All participants were required to have a study partner, usually a relative, who attended the session or provided information by phone. All participants received a 3-hour standard dementia evaluation. The evaluation included an examination by a geriatric psychiatrist specializing in memory concerns, cognitive testing with an English-Chinese bilingual psychometrician, and a research blood draw. Institutional review board approval was obtained at ISMMS. Informed consent was obtained by either the participants or their legally authorized representatives prior to any study procedures.

Chinese Cognitive Tests

Cognitive function was evaluated using Chinese-language translations of cognitive tests that covers domains of memory, executive function, attention, language, and visuospatial skills. The Chinese version of cognitive tests were provided by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The tests were originally translated for Mandarin speakers living in the northern region of China. Additional adaptions were made by the English-Chinese bilingual staff at the ADRC at ISMMS to maximize the suitability of the tests for both Cantonese and Mandarin speakers. For instance, a noun suffix (zi 子) commonly used in Mandarin is rarely used in Cantonese; therefore, this suffix is dropped in Cantonese testing material when appropriate (e.g., gui 柜 vs. gui zi 柜子). Similarly, testing instructions written in Mandarin tend to be overly formal for Cantonese speakers and may bias against those with lower education; therefore, the instructions were colloquialized (e.g., 而家 vs. 现在) so that they remain idiomatic for native Cantonese-speakers. Test administration and scoring were completed by English-Chinese bilingual psychometricians who were trained and supervised by an English-Chinese bilingual neuropsychologist at the ADRC at ISMMS. In this study, verbal memory was assessed using the following tests:

Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale Fourth Edition (WMS-IV) (Wechsler, 2009) is a task in which participants are read two brief stories, and then asked to freely recall the information immediately after hearing each story (immediate recall range = 0–50). After a 20-minute interval, the participants are asked to recall the stories again (delayed recall range = 0–50). The recognition trial, administered after the delayed recall, consists of 24 questions (12 for each story) in multiple-choice format that requires that participants to be able to distinguish story details they learned from those they did not (recognition range = 0–24). The Logical Memory test was used in some of the earliest publications on MCI (Grundman et al., 2004; Petersen et al., 2005).

Philadelphia Verbal Learning Test (PVLT) is a task in which participants are read a 12-item word list over five trials (Garrett, 2013) and asked to repeat the words after each of the five trials. An immediate recall total score can be calculated by summing correct responses following each trial (immediate recall range = 0–60). The short delay recall score is the total number of correct responses recalled after a distraction list (short delay recall range = 0–12), whereas the long delay recall score is the number of words accurately recalled after a 20-minute delay (delayed recall range = 0–12). The recognition trial, administered after the long delay recall, consists of 48 questions in yes/no format that requires the participants to be able to distinguish words they learned from those they did not (recognition range = 0–48). The construction of the PVLT is similar to the 16-item California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), which has been shown to have a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing MCI and predicting conversion to dementia (Rabin et al., 2009).

Clinical and Demographic Measures

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive screening tool designed to assist clinicians in detecting cognitive impairment (Nasreddine et al., 2005). It assesses global cognition and cognitive domains of memory, visuospatial skill, language, attention, and abstract reasoning (score range 0–30). The Beijing version of MoCA has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity for screening older patients with cognitive impairments (Lu et al., 2011). The test is available via http://www.mocatest.org/pdf_files/test/MoCA-Test-Chinese_Beijing.pdf.

The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is a semi-structured global dementia measurement rated by a clinician who was blinded to cognitive scores following interviews with participant and study partner (Morris, 1997). It assesses daily functioning in the areas of memory, orientation, judgment, hobbies, community affairs, and personal care. CDR Sum of Boxes (SOB) is a simple aggregate of scores in the six clinical domains. CDR-SOB scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating more cognitive impairment. The current study used a version that had been translated and adapted by staff at the Peking Medical Union College Hospital in Beijing.

The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a 30-item self-administered inventory (Yesavage et al., 1982). It provides a reliable assessment of depressive symptoms. The 15-item version was used in this study. One point is assigned to each positive answer and cumulative score is rated on a scoring grid. The grid sets a range of 0–4 as “normal”, 5–8 as “mildly depressed,” 9–11 as “moderately depressed,” and 12–15 as “severely depressed.” The Chinese version of GDS has been validated with Chinese residing in China and Chinese immigrants living in Western countries (Dow et al., 2017). The scale is available through https://web.stanford.edu/~yesavage/Chinese2.html.

The Functional Activity Questionnaire (FAQ) measures instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), such as preparing balanced meals and managing personal finances (Gold, 2012). Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating worse functioning. The FAQ was translated and back translated by the English-Chinese bilingual research staff at the ADRC at ISMMS.

Participants’ demographic variables, including age, gender, education, years living in the US, and primary language, were collected during the clinical interview.

Diagnostic Criteria

All participants were assigned a research diagnosis at clinical consensus conference using criterion developed at the ADRC at ISMMS based on accepted research criteria (Petersen et al., 2005) for normal aging, MCI (Albert et al., 2011), and dementia (McKhann et al., 2011). Dementia was further categorized by etiologies as described by the NACC UDS Coding Guidebook (Version 3.0, March 2015). The consensus conference was performed by a geriatric psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist, who conducted the clinical interview, functional assessment, medical exam, and brief mental status examination. Qualitative observations of the participants’ test-taking behaviors and presentations were taken into consideration when formulating impressions about the participants’ cognitive status. Diagnostic categories of normal cognition, MCI, and AD were not determined by the cognitive test scores because valid normative data is often not available for the Chinese-speaking older adult population.

Data Analysis

The current report included a cohort of 210 participants with a research diagnosis of normal control, MCI, or dementia. A total of 73 participants were excluded from the analyses because they were not administered the verbal memory tests, either due to significant cognitive/behavioral difficulties during the session (n=2) or changes in study protocol across years (n=71). Demographic and clinical variables were first compared using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical and continuous variables as appropriate. Dunn’s Multiple Comparison tests with Bonferroni adjustment were conducted for the post-hoc pair-wise tests. Statistical significance was set a priori at p=.05.

To assess the sensitivity of story and word list memory tests (i.e., immediate, delayed, and recognition) for diagnostic discrimination of normal, MCI, and dementia, multinominal logistic regression models were estimated. Age, gender, education, years living in the US, and depressive symptoms (measured by GDS) were controlled in both models.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC area, or AUC) was used to compare the predictive accuracy of the two memory tests. We used standardized composite scores (i.e., immediate + delayed recall or immediate + delayed + recognition) and individual recall variables in the estimation models to compare diagnostic accuracy between the two tests.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics

Demographic, cognitive, and clinical characteristics are compared by diagnostic categories in Table 1. Using the research diagnosis criteria, the sample was categorized into 71 normal controls, 42 with MCI, and 24 with dementia. Within the dementia subgroup, the majority (N=19) was associated with an AD pathology, followed by vascular disease (N=3) and unspecified etiology (N=2). Participants were primarily female (64%) and Mandarin speaking (57%), with a mean age of 74.45±7.43 and education of 13.09±4.33 years. These participants have been living in the US, on average, for 34.43±15.41 years. Older adults in the dementia group were significantly older than the normal controls, while those in the MCI group were not significantly different from the normal controls and dementia group.

The MCI group tended to show significantly worse performance on the MoCA, CDR, and FAQ compared to normal controls but better than that of the dementia group. On the GDS assessment, older adults in the MCI group were more likely to report depressive symptoms than those in normal controls. However, those in the dementia groups did not report significantly different levels of depressive symptoms than the other two groups.

Individual memory scores for the overall sample and by diagnostic categories are also presented in Table 1. For the word list recognition, normal controls performed significantly better than the MCI and dementia groups, but no difference was identified between MCI and dementia groups. For the other memory scores, MCI group performed better than the dementia group and worse than the normal controls.

Multivariate Regression Results

Multinominal logistic regression results from the story memory test models in Table 2 showed that increases in scores on the story delayed recall were associated with decreased likelihood of being in a more impaired diagnostic group (i.e., MCI or dementia) compared to normal control. Story immediate recall and story recognition were not significant predictors for differentiating clinical cognitive status. Similarly, results from the word list memory test models (Table 3) demonstrated that better performance on the word list long delay recall test were associated with decreased likelihood of being classified as MCI than normal control, and better performance on the word list short delay recall were associated with decreased likelihood of being classified as having dementia than normal control (Table 3). Word list immediate recall and recognition were not significant predictors for discriminating clinical cognitive status. In addition, in the story memory test models, being male was associated with higher likelihood of being classified as MCI than normal control; whereas in the word list memory models, more severe depression symptomology was associated with higher likelihood of being classified as MCI. In both models, having lived in the US longer was associated with decreased likelihood of being classified as dementia than normal control. In the story memory test models, higher education was also associated with higher likelihood of dementia diagnosis than normal control.

AUC Analysis Results

We computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC area, or AUC) to assess the accuracy of the two models. Using standardized composite scores (i.e., immediate + delayed recall or immediate + delayed + recognition), results showed that both story and word list memory test discriminated normal from combined MCI/dementia groups in the good range (story AUC=0.85, 95% CI=[0.7800, 0.9215]; word list AUC =0.90, 95% CI=[0. 8434, 0.9498]) (Figure 1). Comparison of AUC showed no statistical difference between the two models (p=0.1437). Results remained unchanged when we used individual recall variables in the estimation models to compare diagnostic accuracy between the two tests.

DISCUSSION

In our study cohort of older Chinese immigrants recruited from a large metropolitan area in the US, cognitive and functional status followed the expected diagnostic pattern of best performance in the normal controls group, poorer in the MCI group, and worst in the dementia group. Memory scores on story and word list tests were highest in the normal controls group, lower among those in the MCI group, and lowest in the dementia group. Our regression models showed that scores on both story and word list delayed recalls differentiated the three diagnostic groups after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Results are consistent with previous findings (Shi et al., 2014; Weissberger et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2012), supporting the use of the Chinese-language translations of verbal delayed recall tests for detection of MCI and dementia, particularly AD, which accounted for 80% of impaired cases in this study. More in-depth examination of learning versus retention scores found that learning performance (immediate recall) of neither test was predictive of clinical diagnosis when entered simultaneously with delayed recall scores. These findings contribute to existing literature supporting that delayed recall is likely a more sensitive measure to detect dementia, especially AD, than learning performance (Bäckman et al., 2005; Hogervorsta et al., 2002; Weissberger et al., 2017). Recognition scores on both word list (yes/no recognition) and story (forced choice recognition) were significantly lower in the MCI and dementia groups compared to the normal control group. However, recognition scores were not sensitive for differentiating the diagnostic groups in the regression analyses, consistent with existing literature showing that recognition paradigms tend to have high specificity but low sensitivity (Weissberger et al., 2017). Overall, our findings suggest that delayed recall may be most helpful for detection of MCI and dementia compared to immediate recall and recognition in this distinct population.

An interesting finding is that gender’s predictive coefficient is significant in the regression model with the story memory test but is not significant in the model with the word list test. Additional descriptive analysis showed that females tend to perform better than males across all verbal memory tests, with a significantly better word list immediate recall in females than in males (p&lt;0.05). These results are consistent with previous investigations that have reported a female advantage in verbal communication abilities (Hyde, 2016; Scheuringer et al., 2017). The story memory test might rely more on verbal skills than the word list test, thus showing a gender effect only in the story memory test model. In addition, having lived in the US longer was associated with a lower likelihood of being diagnosed with dementia in both models. Years living in the US may be a proxy for acculturation because it assumes that more time in the US equals more US cultural knowledge. The findings are consistent with previous studies reporting a relationship between acculturation status and cognition function, with high levels of acculturation relating to better cognitive performance (Mendoza et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). In addition, there is an incidental finding of higher education associated with a higher likelihood of being in the dementia group compared to the normal control group. The results are surprising given the known relationship between education and cognition. That said, several factors might be contributing to these findings. First, our sample size for the dementia group is small and thus may reflect a sample bias. Second, the mean score of the CDR at study entry indicated that the dementia group was already at a somewhat advanced stage of the disease. While the literature demonstrates a benefit of high cognitive reserve - which is often gauged by levels of education - for reducing the risk of developing dementia (Tucker &amp; Stern, 2011), less is known about its role on disease progression and whether it serves as a protective factor or a catalyst for conversion to a more severe stage of the disease, particularly in our study cohort of older Chinese Americans.

The second aim of this study was to determine which verbal memory test is more sensitive in differentiating older U.S. Chinese immigrants with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia by comparing the story memory test from the WMS and the word list test from the PVLT. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in terms of discriminating diagnostic accuracy between the two verbal memory measures. Results remained unchanged when we used standardized composite scores (i.e., immediate + delayed recall or immediate + delayed + recognition) instead of individual recall variables in the estimation models to compare diagnostic accuracy between the two tests. While ROC values were better in the word list memory test compared to the story memory test, differences between the two models were not statistically significant, suggesting that both tests were good predictors for cognitive diagnosis. Previous studies conducted in other ethnic groups suggested that word list tests were more sensitive than story recall (Baek et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2012). Such difference in results may be attributed to unestablished equivalence between the original and the translated versions of the tests. A common challenge in translations of verbal tests is to ensure comparable levels of lexical and structural difficulties between the English and the translated version. A direct translation of the English word list that was developed in the US might change the difficulty or frequency of the words. Similarly, the word count and verbal load of the translated stories might produce differences in the length and grammatical density between the original and the translated versions. These potential changes could alter the cognitive demands in the memory tests, and thus, change the sensitivity or performance of the tests. It should be noted, though, that in clinical practice, verbal memory measures used in isolation is not sufficient for accurate clinical diagnosis. Comprehensive cognitive evaluation assessing a broad range of cognitive functioning remains gold standard for diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders.

This study also has other limitations. First, the sample size in this study was small with relatively few participants with dementia. Studies of a larger cohort are warranted to investigate psychometric properties (e.g., test reliability) of these instruments and establish measurement equivalence in the Chinese-language translations of the tests. Second, all MCI diagnoses were collapsed into one group and participants with different types of dementia were combined into one to maximize sample size within the cognitively impaired groups. Future work should have a closer look at the diagnostic utility of these memory tests for differential diagnosis of various MCI and dementia types. Third, though years of living in the US were found predictive of clinical status, we did not assess pre- (e.g., early-life conditions, trauma, and reasons for immigration) and post-immigration experiences (e.g., acculturation, stress) or level of formal education in English and degree of bilingualism in our older Chinese immigrant cohort. Future investigations should be conducted with these factors to better understand the relationship between immigration experience and cognition. Fourth, as noted before, the test equivalence in regards to linguistic compatibility was not established between the original tests and the Chinese-language translations. Future studies should address the possible effect of linguistic differences and investigate if factors such as levels of education and bilingualism are contributing to the diagnostic utility of these tests in immigrant populations. Lastly, our cohort was recruited from a large metropolitan area, and thus, future research should collect samples that are more representative of the heterogeneity of the Chinese-speaking population residing in various parts of the U.S.

In conclusion, verbal memory tests in Chinese languages distinguished among diagnostic groups of normal controls, MCI and dementia in older U.S. Chinese immigrants. Therefore, the Chinese-language translations of these gold standard verbal memory measures have the potential to assist with diagnostic decision making, consistent with other racial/ethnic groups as reported in the literature. More culturally and linguistically sensitive clinical assessment tools are needed to better evaluate the growing older Chinese immigrant population, thereby reducing health disparities in clinical and research settings.

Question: What is the key question this paper addresses?

The purpose of the current study was to examine the sensitivity of the Chinese translation of word-list learning test and story recall test for differentiating cognitive diagnosis of normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia.

Findings: What are the primary findings?

Chinese translation of verbal memory tests during the delayed recall trials provides the greatest sensitivity to detect cognitive diagnosis.

Importance: What are the key scientific and practical implications of the findings?

Chinese translation of verbal memory tests can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying cognitive impairment.

Next Steps: What directions should be explored in future research?

Examination of test equivalence between Chinese and English versions of verbal memory tests will be needed to identify potential bias across the two language versions.
