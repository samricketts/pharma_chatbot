Endolysosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes are now known to physically and functionally interact with each other. Such findings of inter-organellar signaling and communication has led to a resurgent interest in cell biology and an increased appreciation for the physiological actions and pathological consequences of the dynamic physical and chemical communications occurring between intracellular organelles. Others and we have shown that HIV-1 proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and that Alzheimer’s disease both affects the structure and function of intracellular organelles. Intracellular organelles are highly mobile, and their intracellular distribution almost certainly affects their ability to interact with other organelles and to regulate such important physiological functions as endolysosome acidification, cell motility, and nutrient homeostasis. Indeed, compounds that acidify endolysosomes cause endolysosomes to exhibit a mainly perinuclear pattern while compounds that de-acidify endolysosomes cause these organelles to exhibit a larger profile as well as movement towards plasma membranes. Endolysosome pH might be an early event in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and Alzheimer’s disease and in terms of organellar biology endolysosome changes might be upstream of HIV-1 protein-induced changes to other organelles. Thus, inter-organellar signaling mechanisms might be involved in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and other neurological disorders, and a better understanding of inter-organellar signaling might lead to improved therapeutic strategies.

HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder
Alzheimer’s disease

Introduction:

HIV-1 causes AIDS and there are about 40 million people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). Although PLWH are now living almost full life-spans in the current era of anti-retroviral therapeutics there is a very high prevalence rate of about 50% for HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) (Ellis, Rosario et al. 2010, Heaton, Clifford et al. 2010). Over the past three decades the clinical profile of neuroHIV has changed; less common are severe neurological complications including dementia, and more common are milder forms of neurocognitive impairment. Although not without controversy and complexity, clinical and pathological studies have shown commonalities between neuroHIV and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Intracellular organelles including endolysosomes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes regulate the basic biology of cells and their dysfunction contribute to the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and AD. Over the past decade, it has been increasingly appreciated that intracellular organelles are highly mobile within cells and that they physically and functionally interact with each other. This new field of inter-organellar signaling and communication has led to a resurgent interest in cell biology as it relates to physiological functions and pathological consequences. While many studies have shown an involvement of organelles in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV, relatively few have focused attention on inter-organellar signaling. Here, we focus on three organelles; endolysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In terms of inter-organellar signaling, we focus attention on the possibility that endolysosomes are important up-stream regulators of levels of intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species. The downstream consequences of such changes might help understand better the dysfunctional neural circuits, chronic inflammation, and immunological changes implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and AD.

Organization of this review:

To appreciate the significance of organelles and inter-organellar signaling in health and disease, we first discuss from an evolutionary perspective the physiological roles and pathological consequences of intracellular organelles. Next, we discuss clinical and pathological features of HAND prior to describing structural and functional changes to endolysosomes, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in HAND and AD. However, because we posit that endolysosome changes are up-stream of changes to other organelles, a greater focus has been placed on their physical and functional changes. Finally, we help synthesize the roles that inter-organellar signaling might play in the pathogenesis of HAND.

An evolutionary perspective on physiological roles and pathological consequences of calcium, and organellar function and dysfunction in neurons:

Evolutionary pressure resulted in eukaryotic cells developing intracellular organelles (Jaiswal 2001, Berridge 2003, Case, Eisner et al. 2007) including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes and lysosomes (Wideman, Leung et al. 2014). These evolutionary changes helped protect cells against the toxic actions of, for example, millimolar levels of calcium through the development of semipermeable membranes and intracellular organelles each containing a complex array of calcium pumps and calcium binding proteins. Mitochondria help maintain cellular energetics and are recognized as being ‘sinks’ for intracellular calcium (Carafoli 2010). However, when energy demand outpaces energy supply and/or too much calcium is up-taken into mitochondria cellular energetics are compromised and the resulting calcium overload can lead to a cascade of events including increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death. In addition to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and endolysosomes also have functionally important pools of intracellular calcium. Indeed, endoplasmic reticulum and endolysosomes contain high levels of releasable calcium (Patel and Cai 2015; Hui et al., 2015). Although less well known, endolysosome stores of calcium may contribute to the complex and biologically-important spatial and temporal regulation and dysregulation of calcium (Raffaello, Mammucari et al. 2016). Calcium released from endolysosomes can lead to calcium influx into cells, calcium release from other organelles, and calcium dysregulation-induced neurotoxicity (Hui et al., 2015). Thus, it is important to focus our discussion on the relevance of endolysosomes and their calcium contents in the context of other organelles and the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and other neurological disorders; conditions where calcium dysregulation and organellar dysfunction have been implicated.

HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND):

HIV-1, the causative virus of AIDS, has infected worldwide almost 80 million people; about 40 million people are currently infected. In the current era of anti-retroviral therapeutics, people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) are now living almost full life-spans, but are now experiencing a prevalence rate of about 50% for HAND (Ellis, Rosario et al. 2010, Heaton, Clifford et al. 2010). Over the past three decades the clinical profile of PLWH, especially as it is related generally to the field of neuroHIV, has changed markedly. People with HAND are experiencing less commonly severe neurological complications including dementia and more commonly milder forms of neurological impairment.

Clinically and pathologically, the spectrum of symptoms and underlying mechanisms in neuroHIV have evolved and have become more Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-like including learning and memory deficits as well as increased levels of amyloid beta protein and phospho-tau; two proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Although the pathogenesis of HAND is not fully understood, HIV-1 proteins including gp120, Nef, Vpr and the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription protein Tat have been implicated by others and us to be causative virotoxins in HAND (Sabatier, Vives et al. 1991, Weeks, Lieberman et al. 1995, Haughey, Holden et al. 1999, Nath, Haughey et al. 2000, Perez, Probert et al. 2001, King, Eugenin et al. 2006, Buscemi, Ramonet et al. 2007, Agrawal, Louboutin et al. 2012). Among the implicated HIV-1 viral proteins, HIV-1 Tat has been shown to be present in the CNS of HIV-1 infected individuals and its levels can stay elevated in CSF even when HIV-1 viral levels are immeasurable (Johnson, Patel et al. 2013). Others and we have also shown that HIV-1 Tat directly excites neurons (Magnuson, Knudsen et al. 1995, Nath, Psooy et al. 1996, Nath, Haughey et al. 2000), releases calcium from intracellular stores and disturbs neuronal calcium homeostasis (Haughey, Holden et al. 1999, Haughey and Mattson 2002), disrupts synaptic integrity (Kim, Martemyanov et al. 2008, Fitting, Xu et al. 2010), and induces neurotoxicity (Buscemi, Ramonet et al. 2007, Hui, Chen et al. 2012). Of course, using single HIV-1 proteins for the study of HAND is, by definition, a very reductionist approach and has its limitations. Morphological and functional abnormalities to intracellular organelles including endolysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria have been described for HAND as well as for a variety of other neurodegenerative disorders. However, because endolysosomes are commonly affected first as a result of endocytosed signals we discuss first, and in greater detail, morphological and functional changes to endolysosomes.

Discovery and functions of endolysosomes:

Following the initial description of lysosomes and endocytosis, much has been learned about the many physiological functions regulated by endolysosomes including synaptic function, plasma membrane repair, cell homeostasis, energy metabolism, nutrient-dependent signal transduction, inflammation, and immune responses (de Duve, Pressman et al. 1955, de Duve 2005; Motulsky 1986; Settembre, Fraldi et al. 2013, Perera and Zoncu 2016). It is also now appreciated that the endolysosome system is important for the degradation of extracellular macromolecules and plasma membrane components (Bright, Gratian et al. 2005, de Duve 2005, Luzio, Pryor et al. 2007, Huotari and Helenius 2011), the capturing and degradation of intracellular worn-out constituents through autophagy (Settembre, Fraldi et al. 2013), and that extracellular vesicles (exosomes) originate from multivesicular endosomes (Miranda and DiPaolo, 2018). Endolysosomes (see below) and exosomes (Sun et al., 2019) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV.

The ability of endolysosomes to control a wide spectrum of cellular functions is complemented by the tight control of endolysosome biogenesis, and expression levels and activity of a number of resident acidic enzymes and proteins; findings that highlight the ability of endolysosomes to match their activity to the needs of the cell. Pathologically, morphological and functional changes to endolysosomes have been described for a wide spectrum of diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Colacurcio and Nixon 2016). Thus, endolysosomes represent a complex and dynamic system that helps regulate cellular biological functions.

Acidic nature of endolysosomes:

An important hallmark of the endolysosome system is its acidic luminal pH and findings of their acidic nature predates the actual discovery of lysosomes by about 60 years (Metchnikoff 1893). Endolysosome pH is regulated mainly by vacuolar-ATPase (v-ATPase); v-ATPases are linked to the flux of anionic and cationic counterions and ATP hydrolysis which enables protons to enter endolysosomes against their electrochemical gradients (Huotari and Helenius 2011, Mindell 2012). In addition to endolysosomes, transmembrane proton gradients are also present in mitochondria, Golgi complex and secretory granules as well as on plasma membranes (Mindell 2012). This acidic environment is essential for the functionality of about 60 endolysosome-resident hydrolases (Xu and Ren 2015) that enable endolysosomes to break down a wide range of endogenous and exogenous macromolecules and cargo into such cellular building blocks as amino acids, monosaccharides and free fatty acids (de Duve 2005). At least some of these acidic hydrolases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV (Rivera et al., 2014; Cantres-Rosario et al., 2019). For neurons, endolysosomes are especially important because neurons are mainly long-lived post-mitotic cells that require endolysosomes in turning over cellular components and obsolete organelles (Nixon and Cataldo 1995, A Nixon and M Cataldo 2006). The acidic pH is also important for the fusing of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autophagolysosomes; a process known as autophagy (Tooze and Dikic 2016).

Structural and functional changes to endolysosomes in HAND:

With regards to HAND, morphological changes to endolysosomes have been observed in brain of HIV-infected individuals, in cultured cells exposed to HIV-1 proteins, and in transgenic mouse models of HAND. All are models of this disorder and all have their own set of limitations and qualifications. Accumulation (expansion) of lysosomes was reported in subcortical white matter generally and more specifically in HIV-1 infected cells including astrocytes, macrophages, microglia and glia from individuals with AIDS and HIV-1 associated dementia (Gelman, Soukup et al. 2005, Achim, Adame et al. 2009). Such human pathology findings have also been observed in the laboratory using HAND-related model systems. HIV-1 Tat protein treatment of rat primary hippocampal neurons for 1 and 2 days increased significantly the sizes of endolysosomes and markedly changed their distributions within neurons; in control cells endolysosomes were perinuclear and evenly distributed whereas in Tat-treated neurons they were enlarged, clumped together, and distributed away from the nucleus (Hui, Chen et al. 2012). GFAP-driven doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice exhibited a number of cytopathic intracellular features in astrocytes including increased numbers of lysosomes and that the lysosomes had migrated away from the cell body adjacent to the nucleus and towards distal cytoplasmic processes (Fitting, Xu et al. 2010). These morphological changes are likely caused by HIV-1 Tat-induced de-acidification of endolysosomes because HIV-1 Tat increases the pH of endolysosomes and de-acidification changes endolysosome distribution patterns (Hui, Chen et al. 2012, Chen, Hui et al. 2013, El-Hage, Rodriguez et al. 2015, Fields, Dumaop et al. 2015). Furthermore, such findings might extend beyond HIV-1 Tat to other HIV-1 proteins and to other cell types because gp120 was also shown to de-acidify neuronal endolysosomes (Pietrella, Monari et al. 1998, Bae, Patel et al. 2014, El-Hage, Rodriguez et al. 2015), and human T cells stably expressing functionally active HIV-1 Nef protein exhibited increased numbers of late endosomes and lysosomes (Sanfridson, Hester et al. 1997). These effects of HIV-1 and HIV-1 proteins are likely early and upstream of many other responses because HIV-1 Tat enters neurons via receptor-mediated endocytosis (Liu, Jones et al. 2000, Vendeville, Rayne et al. 2004, Deshmane, Mukerjee et al. 2011). Further, gp120 and HIV-1 Tat elevated endolysosome pH quickly and persistently and disturbed the structure and function of endolysosomes (Kim, Martemyanov et al. 2008, Hui, Chen et al. 2012, Chen, Hui et al. 2013). Such changes in endolysosomes were shown to be prominent and early pathological features of HAND (Gelman, Soukup et al. 2005, Spector and Zhou 2008).

AD-like clinical and pathological features have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV and thus it is relevant to discuss organellar changes in AD. Structural changes to neuronal endolysosomes are some of the earliest pathological features of AD (Cataldo, Petanceska et al. 2004, Tate and Mathews 2006, Arriagada, Astorga et al. 2007, Boland, Kumar et al. 2008), and they precede extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein (Cataldo, Peterhoff et al. 2000). Endolysosomes are very important for amyloidogenic processing of Aβ precursor protein (AβPP) to Aβ because AβPP is first endocytosed, the amyloidogenic enzymes BACE-1 and γ-secretase are almost exclusively located in endosomes and lysosomes, the acidic environment of endolysosomes is favorable for amyloidogenic metabolism of AβPP, and Aβ can be either accumulated in or released from endolysosomes (Nixon 2005, Rajendran, Schneider et al. 2008, Shimizu, Tosaki et al. 2008, Sannerud, Declerck et al. 2011, Rajendran and Annaert 2012, Morel, Chamoun et al. 2013, Jiang, Li et al. 2014). Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and HAND and when hyperphosphorylated, p-tau aggregates and contributes to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Tau aggregates can be degraded by cathepsin D in autophagosomes-lysosomes (Hamano, Gendron et al. 2008, Chesser, Pritchard et al. 2013), and endolysosome dysfunction contributes to tau aggregation and neurofibrillary tangle formation (Bi and Liao 2007, Jo, Gundemir et al. 2014). On the other hand, transcriptional activation of lysosome biogenesis can clear aggregated tau (Polito, Li et al. 2014). Thus, endolysosomes appear to be important sites for the pathogenesis of these neurological disorders and physical and functional changes to endolysosomes may precede other organellar responses and changes.

HIV-1, HIV-1 proteins including HIV-1 gp120 and Tat, as well as anti-retroviral therapeutic drugs used to treat PLWH increase Aβ levels and can contribute to the development of AD-like pathology (Rempel and Pulliam 2005, Giunta, Hou et al. 2009, Aksenov, Aksenova et al. 2010, Chen, Hui et al. 2013, Kim, Yoon et al. 2013, Fields, Dumaop et al. 2015). Dysregulation of intracellular calcium has been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of these same neurological disorders, and release of calcium from endolysosomes (Masgrau, Churchill et al. 2003, Mitchell, Lai et al. 2003, Galione, Morgan et al. 2010) appears to contribute to neuronal calcium signaling and function (Haas, Bhattacharya et al. 2009, Pandey, Chuang et al. 2009, Dickinson, Churchill et al. 2010); calcium release from endolysosomes can trigger calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (Patel and Docampo 2010, Zhu, Ma et al. 2010) and through plasma membranes via aSOCE (Hui, Geiger et al. 2015). Tat-induced de-acidification of endolysosomes and resulting effects on calcium dyshomeostasis likely results from the ability of HIV-1 Tat to decrease the levels and activity of v-ATPase as well as compensatory increases in cathepsin D and LAMP-1 (Deshmane, Mukerjee et al. 2011). The consequences of such alterations in calcium dynamics and homeostasis can be the kinds of synaptic disruption and neurotoxicity observed in various neurodegenerative conditions including neuroHIV and AD (Bendiske, Caba et al. 2002, Bendiske and Bahr 2003, Kanju, Parameshwaran et al. 2007).

Endolysosomes are well known to be acidic organelles that contain high levels of calcium. However, for the cation calcium it was not until fairly recently that these organelles were described as being ‘acidic calcium stores’ because the luminal pH of endolysosomes is acidic and endolysosomes contain high (400 to 600 μM) levels of readily releasable calcium (Christensen, Myers et al. 2002, Morgan, Platt et al. 2011). Neuronal calcium signals display great spatial and temporal complexity and understanding how calcium signals are generated spatially and temporally is necessary to understand calcium-dependent cellular processes. Endolysosome calcium levels are maintained by a variety of uptake and efflux mechanisms. Essential for uptake of calcium into endolysosomes are proton gradients that drive Ca2+ uptake by Ca2+/H+ exchange (Moreno and Docampo 2009, Patel and Docampo 2010, Morgan, Platt et al. 2011). Four main mechanisms for calcium release from endolysosomes have been described including; (1) calcium release through two-pore channels (TPCs) (Calcraft, Ruas et al. 2009, Zong, Schieder et al. 2009, Ruas, Rietdorf et al. 2010, Schieder, Rotzer et al. 2010, Zhu, Ma et al. 2010, Brichacek, Darwish et al. 2014), (2) elevation of endolysosome pH (Christensen, Myers et al. 2002, Camacho, Machado et al. 2008, Machado, Camacho et al. 2009), (3) activation of TRPML1 mucolipin-type channels and P2X4 receptors (Starkus, Fleig et al. 2010, Kiselyov, Colletti et al. 2011, Cao, Zhong et al. 2015), and (4) disruption of endolysosome membranes (Haller, Dietl et al. 1996, McGuinness, Bardo et al. 2007). Of physiological significance, calcium released from endolysosomes has been shown to contribute to a variety of calcium-dependent neuronal processes including neurotransmitter release, neuronal excitability, neurite outgrowth, synaptic remodeling, and cell viability (Repnik, Cesen et al. 2013, Goo, Sancho et al. 2017, Ferguson 2019). These neuronal processes are all significantly affected in neuroHIV and this further highlights the need to understand better the role that endolysosomes play in the pathogenesis of HAND and AD.

Endolysosome calcium release is highly localized (Galione, Morgan et al. 2010, Zhu, Ma et al. 2010, Shen, Wang et al. 2012), and, once released, the calcium can affect the release of calcium from other organellar stores as well as through plasma membranes. The ability of endolysosome calcium to influence multiple other intracellular stores of calcium is great because endolysosomes are highly mobile in cells, are highly dynamic metabolically, have high rates of biogenesis, and can interact physically and functionally with other intracellular organelles. Endolysosome calcium can (1) enhance endoplasmic reticulum calcium loading (Macgregor, Yamasaki et al. 2007) and release (Calcraft, Ruas et al. 2009, Ruas, Rietdorf et al. 2010), (2) affect fusions between late endosomes and lysosomes (Ruas, Rietdorf et al. 2010, Galione, Parrington et al. 2011, Morgan, Platt et al. 2011), and (3) can depolarize plasma membranes, evoke calcium-dependent currents, and stimulate calcium influx across plasma membranes (Brailoiu, Churamani et al. 2009) through mechanisms involving N-type calcium channels and lysosome exocytosis (Hui et al. 2015).

Conceptually and mechanistically, store-operated calcium entry involving endolysosomes in neurons can be distinct from store-operated calcium entry involving endoplasmic reticulum (Hui et al., 2015). In fact, calcium released from endolysosomes did not stimulate endoplasmic reticulum-dependent SOCE in MDCK epithelial cells (Haller, Dietl et al. 1996). Similar to aSOCE in neurons, aSOCE has been observed in other cells following NAADP-induced endolysosome calcium release and large influxes of calcium across plasma membranes (Churchill, O’Neill et al. 2003, MOCCIA, LIM et al. 2003, Moccia, Billington et al. 2006, Brailoiu, Churamani et al. 2009, Naylor, Arredouani et al. 2009). Multiple mechanisms might control aSOCE involving NTCCs including enhanced lysosome exocytosis and the recycling of NTCCs to the plasma membrane where they can participate in aSOCE. Morphologically and functionally this is consistent with findings that de-acidification of endolysosomes changes cellular distribution patterns of these organelles from a mostly peri-nuclear pattern to one where the endolysosomes migrate close to the plasma membrane (Li, Rydzewski et al. 2016).

Structural and functional changes to mitochondria in HAND:

Morphological changes have been described for mitochondria from HIV-1 infected human post mortem brain and from various in vitro and in vivo model systems of HAND (Avdoshina, Fields et al. 2016, Fields, Overk et al. 2016, Fields, Serger et al. 2016). In HIV-1 encephalopathy brain, mitochondria were enlarged and damaged. In HAND brain, mitochondria were enlarged, elongated and localized to the soma of damaged neurons. And, similar findings were found in brain of HIV gp120 transgenic mice. In human primary neurons, HIV-1 gp120- and Tat-induced mitochondrial damage included increased mitochondrial fragmentation and perinuclear aggregation (Teodorof-Diedrich and Spector 2018). In Tat transgenic mice and in neurons exposed to Tat, mitochondria were found to be smaller (Rozzi, Avdoshina et al. 2018). In Vpr expressing cells, mitochondria cristae were swollen, matrices were condensed, and outer membranes were abraded (Huang, Chiang et al. 2012).

Some of these differences in mitochondrial shape and localization may be due to deficits in the removal of damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy is an autophagic process where induction of autophagy occurs concurrent with PINK1-mediated recruitment of NIX1, BNIP3 and FUNDC1 receptors to the outer mitochondrial membrane for ubiquitination by Parkin (Um and Yun 2017). The HIV-proteins gp120 and Tat promote the fragmentation and perinuclear localization of mitochondria. Both gp120 and Tat appear to induce mitophagy by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potentials as well as impairing the delivery of damaged mitochondria to the lysosomal compartment (Teodorof-Diedrich and Spector 2018). The accumulation of damaged mitochondria in astrocytes exposed to HIV-1 virions promotes inflammasome activation and cell death (Ojeda, Grasso et al. 2018), presumably by mechanisms that involve HIV-1 single stranded RNA activation of the pattern recognition receptor NLRP3 (Rawat, Teodorof-Diedrich et al. 2019). Activation of the inflammasome by HIV requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recognition of the virus by distinct endosomal Toll-like receptors (Chattergoon et al., 2014). Thus, endolysosomes, mitochondria and inter-organellar signaling might play significant roles in the immunological and inflammatory changes caused by HIV-1 and HIV-1 proteins.

One of the major mechanisms by which mitochondria are damaged involves oxidative stress. Several studies have looked at oxidative stress in the context of HAND. Under these conditions, proteins undergo post-translational modifications leading to the formation of protein carbonyls or nitrosylation. Mitochondria are a major source of ROS. Under normal circumstances, oxidative and nitrosative radicals are produced but are kept under check by anti-oxidant systems. However, impairment of these anti-oxidant systems can lead to over-production of these radicals which may bind to proteins, lipids or DNA within the mitochondria and this can lead to the generation of mitochondrial DNA mutations, damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, alterations in membrane permeability, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and altered mitochondrial interactions with endolysosomes. These modifications induced by oxidative stress can be recognized by mass spectrometry or by antibody-based assays. Several studies have demonstrated increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals and increased levels of oxidative and nitrosative stress correlate with the severity of HAND (Boven, Gomes et al. 1999, Nakamura, Masutani et al. 2002, Turchan, Pocernich et al. 2003, Li, Malpica-Llanos et al. 2008).

HIV-1 proteins have been implicated in the generation of ROS, the source of which may be macrophages. The HIV-1 protein Nef functions as a mediator of superoxide release (Olivetta, Mallozzi et al. 2009) and induces the phosphorylation of p47phox the results of which are the translocation of NADPH oxidase to membranes, the assembly of a functional complex, and the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen (Vignais 2002, Olivetta, Mallozzi et al. 2009). HIV-Tat protein reduces manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) mRNA level and protein expression (Westendorp, Shatrov et al. 1995). Mn-SOD is the main enzyme that reduces superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. A weakened antioxidant system in addition to the increased radical production may contribute to the disturbed redox state of the cells and lead to further expression of redox-sensitive TNF-α and other cytokines that mediate inflammation (Tyor, Glass et al. 1992). Tat can also promote nitrosative stress in microglia and astrocytes (Polazzi, Levi et al. 1999, Liu, Jana et al. 2002). This may lead to a domino effect involving the activation of more microglia and macrophages and the subsequent damage to neuronal mitochondria and other cellular organelles.

Structural and functional changes to endoplasmic reticulum in HAND:

Morphological changes to endoplasmic reticulum have also been described in, at least, one animal model of HAND. GFAP-driven doxycycline-inducible HIV-1 Tat transgenic mice exhibited increased numbers and density of endoplasmic reticulum-associated ribosomal clusters (Nissl bodies) and free ribosomes in the cytoplasm (Fitting, Ignatowska-Jankowska et al. 2013). Of relevance to PLWH, animals chronically treated with alcohol in combination with the anti-HIV protease inhibitors ritonavir and lopinavir showed damage to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; animals treated only with the protease inhibitors displayed moderate dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum and dispersed Golgi apparatus (Ji 2017). In the context of the high risk of PLWH developing metabolic disorders and atherosclerosis, macrophages infected with a VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 were found to re-distribute the cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) from plasma membrane to endoplasmic reticulum (Brichacek, Darwish et al. 2014).

Capacitative influx of calcium into cells was described over 30 years ago (Putney 1986). Such calcium influx mechanisms, that are now commonly referred to as SOCE, are principally initiated by a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores followed by influx of extracellular calcium in a variety of cells including neurons in order to refill the depleted stores of calcium. Mechanistically, depleting endoplasmic reticulum calcium stores drives the oligomerization and translocation of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) proteins to endoplasmic reticulum junctions close to the plasma membrane. Such STIM1 translocation induces the clustering of calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 (Orai1) channels and/or transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channels into plasma membranes thereby enabling extracellular calcium entry (Putney 2009).

Endoplasmic reticulum stress has been repeatedly implicated in neuronal dysfunction and death associated with HIV-1 infection. The endoplasmic reticulum is a multifunctional organelle that sequesters and releases calcium, regulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and protein folding (Song, Tan et al. 2017). Endoplasmic reticulum stressors, such as dysregulations in cytosolic calcium, redox balance, and misfolded proteins all can trigger autophagy; a cellular degradation system that is designed to normalize cellular metabolism through the catabolic lysis of unwanted proteins and lipids. There is a considerable amount of evidence that this protective mechanism is dysfunctional in the HIV/SIV infected brain. The autophagosome ubiquitin binding protein p62 (binds proteins targeted for autophagy), and ubiquitin are elevated in the hippocampus, caudate, frontal lobe and cerebellum of SIV-infected non-human primates with encephalitis, and in brain tissues from HIV-infected patients with dementia (Alirezaei, Kiosses et al. 2008). Thus, SIV and HIV-1 are associated with impairments in the degradation of proteins tagged for elimination. These finding were later confirmed and expanded to show elevations of the autophagic regulatory proteins Beclin 1, Atg-5, Atg-7, and LC-III in HIV infected brains with evidence of encephalitis (Zhou, Masliah et al. 2011, Dever, Rodriguez et al. 2015). Subsequently, reductions in the expression of autophagic regulatory protein Atg-5 and the ubiquitin binding protein SQSTM1 were reported in HIV-infected patients without encephalitis who were cognitively impaired compared to patients with normal cognitive function (Dever, Rodriguez et al. 2015). While these data suggest impairments in autophagy may contribute to neural dysfunction in HIV-infected patients with encephalitis and in patients with cognitive impairment, it is not clear if deficits in autophagy remain in HIV-infected patients with antiretroviral suppressed plasma/CSF viral loads. Chronic low-level inflammation persists despite effective control of viral replication (Saylor, Dickens et al. 2016, Delery and MacLean 2019). Further, autophagy is impaired in the setting of viral infection and in cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines (Ahmad, Mostowy et al. 2018). Accordingly, there may be some residual impairments in autophagic function despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy.

Experiments in culture systems and animal models have shed some light on the mechanisms that may be involved in dysfunctions of autophagy associated with HIV-infection. As discussed above, oxidative stress is a common finding with HIV-infection and a number of HIV proteins, and intact HIV virions have been identified as “stressors” that dysregulate cellular calcium handling and redox balance (see above). Decreased expression of autophagy regulatory proteins beclin-1 and LC3 were observed in aged gp120 transgenic mice with an increase in expression of the stress response protein mTor. Lentivirus-mediated beclin-1 gene transfer to activate autophagy pathways resulted in increased beclin-1, LC3, and microtubule-associated protein 2 expression and reduction of glial fibrillary acidic protein and Iba1 expression (Fields, Dumaop et al. 2013). These findings suggest that induction of autophagy in gp120 transgenic mice reduces glial activation. In human neuron and glial cultures activation of autophagy with rapamycin protects neurons and reduces glial stress induced by HIV gp120 or supernatants form HIV-infected cells (Alirezaei, Kiosses et al. 2008, Mehla and Chauhan 2015). Similarly, reduced expression levels of autophagic regulatory proteins LC3-II and Atg12-Atg5 conjugates were observed in primary rodent neuronal cell cultures treated with supernatants from HIV or SIV infected macrophages. Induction of autophagy with rapamycin protected neurons from toxicity associated with exposure to supernatants from HIV and SIV infected macrophages (Alirezaei, Kiosses et al. 2008). These data typify some of the known interactions between cellular stressors and autophagy and suggest that interventions which activate autophagy could be neuroprotective in the setting of HIV-infection.

Physical interactions and functional relevance of inter-organellar signaling in HAND:

It is becoming increasingly clear that endolysosomes physically and functionally interact with other intracellular organelles including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes (see Figure). Such recognition has led to a resurgent interest in cell biology and an increased appreciation for the physiological significance and pathophysiological consequences of the dynamic physical and chemical communications occurring between intracellular organelles including those regulated by pH and released cations such as calcium. The ability of endolysosomes to change their distribution pattern within cells almost certainly affects their ability to interact with other organelles and to regulate such important physiological functions as lysosome acidification, cell motility, and nutrient homeostasis. Others and we have shown that compounds that acidify endolysosomes including the mucolipin synthetic agonist ML-SA1 or the endogenous agonist of TRPML-1 phosphatidlyinositol-3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) cause endolysosomes to exhibit a mainly perinuclear pattern while compounds that de-acidify endolysosomes cause these organelles to exhibit a larger profile and movement towards plasma membranes (Li, Rydzewski et al. 2016). Given the above discussed roles of endolysosomes, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in HAND, and the burgeoning literature about inter-organellar signaling, it seems obvious that greater attention must be paid to inter-organellar signaling mechanisms both to determine underlying disease mechanisms but also new therapeutic strategies.

Physical interactions between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum were first described 60 years ago and the functional significance of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) was characterized 30 years ago (Herrera-Cruz and Simmen 2017). MAMs are now known to be contact points between ER and mitochondria and through which calcium is known to flow. Currently, work continues to be focused on the physical and functional interactions between organelles (Li, Rydzewski et al. 2016) as well as the role that organellar interactions plays in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Area-Gomez and Schon 2016, Joshi, Kornfeld et al. 2016). As it relates to endolysosomes, it is now known that there are extensive physical interactions between endolysosomes and mitochondria and that these inter-organellar communications participate in lipid and metabolite exchange as well as mitochondrial quality control (Soto-Heredero, Baixauli et al. 2017). Conversely, mitochondrial dysfunction has been found to negatively affect lysosome structure and function through, for example, ROS-dependent mechanisms (Demers-Lamarche, Guillebaud et al. 2016). Extensive membrane contact sites (MCS) have been described between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum, that these contact sites were evolutionarily conserved, and that calcium released from lysosomes was sufficient to stimulate endoplasmic reticulum-dependent calcium-induced calcium release (Kilpatrick, Eden et al. 2013, Penny, Kilpatrick et al. 2014, Hariri, Ugrankar et al. 2016). However, only recently was it shown that endolysosomes maintain their thousand-fold calcium concentration gradient in cells in part by refilling endolysosome stores of calcium from IP3-regulated stores of calcium in endoplasmic reticulum (Garrity, Wang et al. 2016).

Clearly, different results have been reported by different laboratories as they relate to inter-organellar signaling events. Some of the differences in findings as to calcium movements between organelles might be because of cell-specific mechanisms. In addition, the difficult nature of understanding inter-organellar calcium dynamics is highlighted by work showing that STIM1 and STIM2 are expressed in endolysosomes, at least in platelets, and that depletion of acidic organellar stores of calcium can increase protein-protein interactions between STIM proteins with Orai1 and TRPC channels to induce SOCE (Zbidi, Jardin et al. 2011). It is further complicated by findings that calcium released through endolysosome-resident TRML1 channels can cause calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum and calcium influx (Kilpatrick, Yates et al. 2016), and that NAADP has been implicated in this “cross-talk” (Ronco, Potenza et al. 2015). Moreover, endosome-associated two pore channels regulate contacts between endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes to control epidermal growth factor signaling (Kilpatrick, Eden et al. 2017).

More specifically to HAND, we are aware of relatively few studies that have been published regarding inter-organellar signaling. Using human astrocytes, HIV-1-, IL-1β-and abacavir-dependent opening of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pores and permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes, both early and important events that lead to apoptosis, were found to be dependent on and subsequent to endoplasmic reticulum stress and release of calcium for endoplasmic reticulum stores (Tsujimoto and Shimizu 2007, Nooka and Ghorpade 2017). The HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) was found to be transported from ER through MAMs to mitochondria where Vpr was found to deform mitochondrial outer membranes (MOMs), increase bulging in MAMs, increase the permeability of MOMs, and cause a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (Huang, Chiang et al. 2012).

Conclusions and a view towards the future of cell biology and HAND:

Endolysosomes, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND and AD. Clearly emerging in the field of cell biology are mechanisms by which organelles can physically link with and functionally signal between organelles. Morphological and functional changes in organelles have been observed in AD and HAND, and results suggest that endolysosomes may be affected upstream of changes to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. These effects on endolysosome structure and function have clear implications to the pathogenesis of AD and HAND; neurological disorders that show some overlap in terms of clinical and pathological features. This raises the possibility that therapeutic interventions against HAND and AD might include endolysosome targets in addition to or in place of targets on other organelles. We are excited to be part of this emerging area of cell biology focused on inter-organellar signaling and look forward to further studies especially as it relates to understanding better the pathogenesis of and possible treatments against HAND and AD.

HIV-1, HIV-1 proteins and inter-organellar calcium signaling.

HIV-1 Tat and gp120 proteins can de-acidify endolysosomes and increase levels of intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS). De-acidification-induced release of calcium from endolysosomes can increase acidic store-operated calcium influx through N-type calcium channels (NTCCs) and may affect the release of endoplasmic reticulum calcium through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and store-operated calcium influx through the actions of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1 (Orai) channels. Endolysosome calcium can be released through transient receptor potential mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) and two pore (TPC) channels, and mitochondrial calcium can be up-taken through voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) and mitochondria calcium uniporters (MCU). Endolysosomes can physically interact with endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria through membrane contact sites (MCS) and endoplasmic reticulum interact with mitochondria through mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). Thus, HIV-1 proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) can effect changes to endolysosomes and these affects might be early and up-stream inter-organellar signaling mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of neuroHIV. A better understanding of inter-organellar signaling might lead to improved therapeutic strategies.

Highlights for Review

It is becoming increasingly clear that endolysosomes physically and functionally interact with other intracellular organelles including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membranes. This has led to a resurgent interest in cell biology and an increased appreciation for the physiological actions and pathological consequences of the dynamic physical and chemical communications occurring between intracellular organelles. Related to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) HIV-1 proteins affect the structure and function of intracellular organelles. Alterations in the structure and function of organelles is also implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. The distribution of organelles changes as a result of insults and these altered distributions almost certainly affect their ability to interact with other organelles and modify their functions. Endolysosome pH might be an early event in the pathogenesis of HAND and AD, and in terms of organellar biology endolysosome changes might be upstream of other changes in organellar biology. A better understanding of inter-organellar signaling might lead to improved therapeutic strategies.
