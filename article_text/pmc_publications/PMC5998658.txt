Background

Emerging evidence suggests a possible role of the renin angiotensin system in the pathophysiologic process of Alzheimer’s disease, of which angiotensin converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) and angiotensin II (ANGII) are important proteins. Few studies evaluated associations between blood ACE-1 and none between ANGII levels, and cognition.

Objective

Our pilot study was aimed to examine associations between blood ACE-1 and ANG II levels and cognitive function in non-demented participants at baseline and over a 1-year period.

Methods

56 participants were included from the Brain Health Substudy of the Baltimore Experience Corps Study. Linear regression analysis, adjusting for confounders, was used to determine associations between baseline ACE-1 and ANGII, and baseline and 1-year follow-up measures of psychomotor and processing speed, executive function, verbal learning memory and working memory, and whether these associations were mediated by blood pressure.

Results

Participants were predominantly female (75%), African-American (93%), with mean age of 67.8 years and education of 14.3 years. There were no associations between baseline ACE-1 or ANGII levels and cognitive function; however, there were significant association between baseline ACE-1 levels and 1-year follow-up Trail Making Test, Part A (β = 0.003, p = 0.04) and Digit Span (β = −0.001, p = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this cognitively intact sample, elevated ACE-1 levels were associated with worse processing speed and working memory after 1 year. Findings from this pilot study suggest that changes in the RAS are associated with alterations in cognitive function warranting further assessment of the role of RAS in neurodegenerative disorders.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia is a rapidly increasing clinical and public health issue, primarily as a result of the aging of the population [1]. Without effective therapy for dementia, specifically Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there will be an estimated three-fold increase in new AD cases, to 13.2 million by the year 2050 [2]. Thus, identifying new and potentially effective approaches to prevention and/or treatment is critical given the lack of effective interventions to date.

Recent advances in research have demonstrated the presence of mixed rather than single brain pathologies in patients with dementia, with combinations of various forms of vascular disease and AD pathology [3, 4]. Additionally, evidence suggests that pathological changes in the brain precede symptoms by years and furthermore, that vascular changes possibly precede AD pathology [5]. The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in blood pressure (BP) regulation and there is emerging evidence about its possible involvement in the pathogenesis ofADeither by blood pressure or by additional mechanisms [6–8]. For example, it has been shown that levels and or activity of key component of the RAS are altered in patients with AD, such as increased angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE-1) levels and activity resulting in increased conversion of angiotensin I to II (ANGII) [6–8] and decreased angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) activity resulting in decreased conversion of ANGII to angiotensin 1–7 [9], all resulting in increased levels of ANGII. Increased levels of ANGII result in increased activation of angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R), which is associated with accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau [6–8, 10, 11]. Additionally, a recent study in post-mortem brains of people with AD has also found elevated levels not only of ANGII, but also of angiotensin III (ANGIII), and ANGIII levels were strongly associated with elevated levels of Aβ and tau [12].

Epidemiological studies suggest that antihypertensive medications acting via the RAS, such as ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) and AT1R blockers, protect against cognitive decline [6, 13, 14], and that repurposing these drugs may have therapeutic potential in AD. There are currently few studies available evaluating associations between blood ACE-1 levels and cognitive aging or dementia [15–17], and none between blood ANGII levels and cognitive function. We evaluated the association between blood levels of ANGII and ACE-1 and cognitive function at baseline and over a 1-year follow-up within a non-demented, community-dwelling older adult sample. We further explored whether these associations were mediated by BP.

METHODS AND MATERIALS

Participants

Participants were recruited from the Brain Health Study (BHS) [18, 19], a substudy within the Baltimore Experience Corps Trial (BECT), following the completion of the trial. The BECT was a sex-stratified, randomized, controlled effectiveness trial to evaluate the health benefits for older adults participating in a high-intensity volunteer service program vs. a control group offered low-intensity volunteer opportunities [20]. BECT [21, 22] and BHS results have been published previously [19]. Enrollment criteria have also been described previously [18, 19]. Briefly, the BHS enrolled 123 participants free of dementia at baseline. Baseline and follow-up evaluations included medical history, neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological examinations and laboratory studies. In 2010, after completion of the intervention, participants were recruited to our pilot study to explore associations between ACE-1 and ANGII levels and cognition. Based on the 4-year recruitment cohorts of the BECT [20], this included participants attending follow-up visits 2, 3, and 4. Inclusion criteria for the pilot study included consent to a fasting blood draw, free of brain disease (tumor, neurodegenerative diseases, infection, cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric disease, and delirium), inflammatory disease (autoimmune), end stage renal and liver disease, or cancer, and no use of ACE-I or AT1R blockers in previous 3 months. 56 participants agreed to participate in the pilot study; 40 of those were also evaluated one-year later. The study was approved by the institutional IRB of the Johns Hopkins University and participants provided written informed consent.

Demographic information (age, gender, race, years of education) was assessed using questionnaires, medical history was based on self-report history of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Additionally, anthropometric measures included height and weight, BP readings, cognitive, physical, health data have been collected, along with blood, on an annual basis.

Blood ACE-1 and ANGII assay

Blood collection and storage

All blood drawing and processing followed established protocols using standard venipuncture procedures after an 8-h fast for the proposed study. Peripheral venous blood samples for ACE-1 levels were obtained (5 ml), allowed to clot for 20 min and were centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min at 22°C. After centrifugation, serum was aliquoted in 1 ml vials and were taken to the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) Core Laboratory, where it was stored at −80°C until assayed. For the ANGII levels blood samples were obtained (5 ml) from the participants and were immediately centrifuged 800 rpm for 10 min at 22°C. After centrifugation, the clear EDTA plasma layer (approximately 1 ml) was collected and taken to the JHU ICTR Core Laboratory, where it was stored at −70°C until assayed. Blood assays were performed using standardized procedures in JHU ICTR Core Laboratory. ACE-1 and ANGII were assayed at the same time with duplicate samples and controls.

Immunoassays

A commercially available sandwich ELISA (R&amp;D systems) was used according to the manufacturer’s guidelines to measure ACE-1 levels in serum. ACE-1 concentrations were determined by interpolation from the standard curve determined for each plate from the known. The concentration of ACE-1 is expressed in ng/ml. The interassay coefficient of variance for ACE-1 measurements was 3%. The assay sensitivity was 0.05 ng/ml. The concentrations of ANGII were measured by enzyme immunoassay using plates coated with ANGII monoclonal antibody and a detection antibody labeled with acetylcholinesterase, and ANGII inhibitor cocktail and phenyl cartridges for sample preparation and extraction following the manufacturer’s protocol (Cayman Chemical). The concentration of ANGII is expressed in pg/ml. The interassay coefficient of variance for ANGII measurements was 6.2%. The assay sensitivity was 2.0 pg/ml.

Outcome measures

Cognitive function

Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered to evaluate speed of processing, executive function, visual-spatial function and verbal memory. Psychomotor and processing speed, respectively, were measured using the paper-and-pencil versions of the Trail-Making Test Part A (TMT, part A) [23] and the Pattern Comparison task [24]. Executive functioning was measured using the Trail-Making Test Part B (TMT, part B) [32]. Verbal learning was measured using the sum of five trials of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) [25], short and long verbal memory was measured using Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), while working memory was measured using the Digit Span Forward, Backward and Total tasks [24, 26].

Blood pressure

At each study visit, BP was measured by a trained nursing staff according to standard protocols. The participant’s BP was measured while the participant was sitting in an upright position with legs uncrossed and feet flat on the floor for approximately 5 min. Three blood pressure readings, with 30-s intervals between each measurement, were obtained on the right arm using a mercury sphygmomanometer with an appropriate-sized occluding cuff and were averaged for data analysis. Measures of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressiore (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP) were used in analyses.

Statistical analysis

Participants baseline characteristics were summarized using frequencies with percentages or means with standard deviations (SD). Participants undergoing blood analysis were compared to those without blood analysis using analysis of variance test of equal means for continuous measures and Fisher’s exact test for categorical measures.

For each outcome measure linear regression models were used to evaluate 1) associations between baseline blood levels of log converted ACE-1 and ANGII and cognitive function at baseline and one year later. In exploratory BP mediation analyses, we additionally evaluated whether 2) baseline blood levels of log converted ACE-1 and ANGII were associated with BP measures at baseline and one year later; and whether 3) baseline BP measures were associated with cognitive function at baseline and one year later. The exploratory analyses evaluated whether associations between blood levels of ACE-1 and ANGII and cognition were mediated by BP.

In the first model, linear regression analyses were unadjusted; in the second model analyses were adjusted for potential confounding effects of age, gender, race, education, SBP, DBP, body mass index (BMI), depression and the number of diseases at baseline. The variable of “number of additional diseases” was used to reduce the number of confounders, after we separately assessed individual diseases and found no significant associations between blood levels of ACE and ANGII, and history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Additionally, the fully adjusted model was also adjusted for baseline ANGII levels for all analyses evaluating associations between ACE-1 levels and cognition and blood pressure, and vice versa, since levels are dependent from each other.

Analyses were performed using STATA version 12.1 (Stata Corp LP, Inc., College Station, TX). All reported p values are two-sided and significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

RESULTS

DISCUSSION

Our study capitalizes on recent advances in RAS neurobiology and adds new information to fill the gap in understanding of the role of RAS in cognitive aging as a precursor to dementia, and suggests the importance of additional research. In our pilot study, we evaluated associations between blood levels of ACE-1 and ANGII and cognitive functions in a subset of 56 cognitively normal community dwelling participants with high vascular risk factor burden in the Brain Health Study (BHS). We found that higher baseline ACE-1 levels were associated with worse processing speed and working memory at 1-year follow-up. Exploratory analyses suggest that these associations were not mediated through blood pressure control, suggesting alternative mechanisms.

Our study is the first to evaluate associations between ACE-1 or ANGII blood levels and cognitive function in a non-demented older adult population. There are only a few studies evaluating blood levels of ACE-1 in relation to AD pathology or brain imaging, with one cross-sectional study showing lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum ACE-1 levels in AD participants when compared to normal controls [17]; another cross-sectional study by the same group showed no association between CSF or serum ACE-1 levels and cortical atrophy [27]. Based on the above mentioned and other studies [6–8], we hypothesized that higher blood levels of ACE-1 and ANGII are associated with worse cognitive function, which was confirmed by our 1-year follow-up evaluation of ACE-1 level and working memory and processing speed. Contrary to our hypothesis, we have found no associations between ANGII and cognitive measures.

Our findings of elevated ACE-1 levels predicting worse processing speed and working memory is in line with literature. Previous studies have shown that processing speed in addition to memory declines with age [28], and that vascular risk factors are associated with increased white matter burden resulting in worsening processing speed and working memory [29, 30].

The remaining question in our study is the lack of associations between ANGII levels and cognitive function. ANGII levels are the result of cleavage from angiotensin I, which is mediated by ACE-1, thus similar results between ACE-1 levels and cognitive function would have been expected with ANGII. Baseline ACE-1 levels were significantly correlated with ANGII levels, thus dysregulation of this pathway could not explain our findings. One possibility could be, that associations of ACE-1 and cognitive function are not mediated by ANGII, but rather by other angiotensins. For example, ACE-1 is not only involved in the conversion of angiotensin I to II, but also in the conversion of angiotensin 1–9 to angiotensin 1–7, with angiotensin 1–7 being a counter factor to ANGIIs vascular effects [8]. Additionally, a recent study using post-mortem brains of people with AD has also shown an increased conversion of ANGII to ANGIII and decreased metabolism of ANGIII, resulting in increased ANGIII levels [12]. Lastly, another enzyme, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), has also been shown to play an important role in the metabolism of ANGII, by converting ANGII to angiotensin 1–7 [8, 9, 12]. Thus, measuring levels of additional angiotensins and enzymes, including angiotensin 1–7, ANGIII, and ACE-2 would help to better understand our results and elucidate mechanism by which RAS is involved in cognition.

Recent advances showing the presence of mixed rather than single brain pathologies in patients with dementia, with various forms of vascular disease burden in addition to AD pathology [3, 4], highlight the need to focus on vascular, as well as amyloid, pathologies. The advances in vascular disease detection and the lack of currently available effective medication have resulted in an increased interest in antihypertensive medications (AHM) and their possible role in cognitive function and dementia [31, 32]. Epidemiological studies suggest that AHM acting via the RAS, such as ACE-I and AT1R blockers, protect against cognitive decline [6, 33, 34].However, results of numerous randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of ACE-I and/or AT1R blockers on risk of cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients have been mixed [31, 35–39], possibly due to the fact that dementia was a secondary outcome. Our findings regarding ACE-1 levels and worsening cognition could provide one possible mechanistic explanation of the beneficial effects of ACE-I in the prevention of cognitive decline. Our negative findings regarding ANGII levels and cognition however suggests the need for further studies exploring other possible pathways by which ATR1 exert their beneficial effect.

There are a number of advantages of this study. Our study included a well-characterized, sociodemographically at risk cohort of highly functioning, community-dwelling, older participants free of cognitive impairment at baseline with detailed cognitive testing and medical history, who underwent rigorous evaluation. Second, this study is population-based design, which minimizes self-selection on outcomes of interest. Third, the study examined at risk for cognitive impairment participants free of cognitive impairment at baseline. We were able to explore the possible role of blood pressure levels in order to explore one aspect of possible mechanisms.

There are limitations of this study. The sample size of our pilot study is small, which may result in a lack of power. Additionally, a one-year follow-up may have not been sufficient to capture changes in cognitive function in this non-demented cohort. Since this study involved mainly older African American women, its findings may not generalize to other populations. Nonetheless, this under-represented group has numerous medical and demographic risk factors that place them at elevated risk for dementia. Additional weakness is the fact, that only ACE-1 and ANGII levels of the complex RAS were measured, thus the complex mechanisms may not be captured.

In summary, this pilot study indicates that ACE-1 levels were associated with decline in processing speed and working memory at 1-year follow up and this effect was not mediated by blood pressure. Our findings are small, but results warrant further research with additional members of the RAS, in a larger sample size including participants with both normal and impaired cognition, and following them for a longer period in order to evaluate possible effects of RAS to improve identification of pharmacologic targets for preventive interventions to slow cognitive decline and delay the progression to dementia.
