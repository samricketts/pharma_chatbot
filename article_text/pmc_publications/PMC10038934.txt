While Alzheimer’s disease is associated with inner retina thinning (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL)), we have observed photoreceptor outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration tauopathy (FTLD-Tau) compared to normal controls. We hypothesized that ONL thinning may distinguish FTLD-Tau from patients with biomarker evidence of AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) and will correlate with FTLD-Tau disease severity.

Predicted FTLD-Tau (pFTLD-Tau; n=21; 33 eyes) and predicted ADNC (pADNC; n=24; 46 eyes) patients were consecutively enrolled, underwent OCT macula imaging, and disease was categorized (pFTLD-Tau vs. pADNC) with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, genetic testing, and autopsy data when available. Adjusting for age, sex, and race, pFTLD-Tau patients had a thinner ONL compared to pADNC, while RNFL and GCL were not significantly different. Reduced ONL thickness correlated with worse performance on Folstein mini-mental state examination and clinical dementia rating® plus frontotemporal dementia sum of boxes for pFTLD-Tau but not pADNC. Photoreceptor ONL thickness may serve as an important non-invasive diagnostic marker that distinguishes FTLD-Tau from ADNC.


pmc1. Introduction

FTLD-Tau is a neuropathologic diagnosis for patients with frontal temporal lobar degeneration from a tauopathy. These patients compose about half of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients; most other FTD patients have a proteinopathy from TDP-43 (tar DNA binding protein-43) referred to as FTLD-TDP (Irwin et al., 2015). There is no approved therapeutic for FTLD-Tau or FTLD-TDP, and optimal clinical trial design has been impeded by challenges in clinically distinguishing FTLD-Tau, not only from FTLD-TDP, but also from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For example, as many as 30% of patients diagnosed clinically with FTD can have a neuropathologic diagnosis of AD (Irwin et al., 2013; Kertesz et al., 2005; Knibb et al., 2006). While some FDA-approved AD biomarkers are serving useful to detect AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) during life, (Fleisher et al., 2020; Jack et al., 2018) biomarkers specific to FTLD are lacking. Thus, there continues to be a critical need for biomarkers indicative of the underlying molecular pathology to enable patient stratification for therapies aimed at the molecular pathology.

Growing literature has pointed towards the retina as a potential biomarker for dementia as it is an extension of the central nervous system that can be easily imaged at high-resolution (Chan et al., 2018; Kashani et al., 2021; Moinuddin et al., 2021). Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that is widely available, inexpensive, and can image the retina within minutes. Compared to normal controls, we found with OCT that a group of FTD patients with clinical or genetic/autopsy findings suggestive of underlying FTLD-Tau pathology had outer retina thinning driven by loss of the photoreceptor outer nuclear layer (ONL) (Kim et al., 2017). We have previously validated these findings using two different OCT image segmentation algorithms, and longitudinal data has suggested that this ONL thinning persists and progresses among probable FTLD-Tau patients (Kim et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020). Moreover, we found ONL loss in the retinal tissue of two FTLD-Tau patients who had ONL thinning during life on OCT for important postmortem validation (Kim et al., 2021). Importantly, these findings of ONL (outer retina) thinning contrast with other studies of OCT imaging and histopathology data in AD patients which find predominant inner retina (nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer) thinning, but comparative studies with FTLD-Tau are lacking (Chan et al., 2018).

Here, we take a critical step to build on our previous work by addressing this gap. We test the hypothesis that ONL thinning is specific to FTLD-Tau compared to AD, and ONL thinning will relate to measures of disease severity in a prospective cohort of deeply phenotyped patients.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants

Highly-predicted FTLD-Tau and AD patients seen consecutively at the Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center (Penn FTDC) of the University of Pennsylvania were prospectively enrolled from 2014 – 2021. Clinical diagnosis is reviewed at weekly multidisciplinary consensus case conferences at the FTDC using modern clinical criteria as described (Kim et al., 2017). Patients are co-enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal research program that includes cognitive assessments, biofluid collection, and neuroimaging. Patients were selected for study based on AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and features predictive of underlying FTLD-Tau as detailed below. The criteria stated below applied to all patients evaluated for this study. Compared to our previous study (Kim et al., 2017), we used a modified critieria to define a highly-predicted FTLD-Tau group; with this criteria, 13 patients from the prior study were eligible to be included.

The predicted FTLD-Tau (pFTLD-Tau) group was composed of FTD patients which had negative CSF testing for AD and also met at least one of the following criteria: 1) clinical diagnosis of probable progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) according to published criteria (Hoglinger et al., 2017) given the high concordance of PSP with FTLD-Tau, 2) pathogenic mutation diagnostic of FTLD-Tau, or 3) neuropathologic diagnosis of FTLD-Tau without significant Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) (i.e. intermediate or high-level) or FTLD-TDP co-pathology (Montine et al., 2012).

The predicted ADNC (pADNC) comparator group was defined by CSF biomarker data suggestive of ADNC and a clinical diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD or FTD-spectrum disorders known to have a subset of patients with underlying ADNC consistent with CSF biomarker studies (i.e. logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, corticobasal syndrome, posterior cortical atrophy), as well as absence of neuropathologic or genetic data suggesting FTLD-Tau or FTLD-TDP co-pathology if available (Albert et al., 2011; Armstrong et al., 2013; Crutch et al., 2012; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011). Please see Figure 1 for flow chart of patient selection.

2.2 Cerebrospinal Fluid Collection and Analysis

CSF collection was performed as described (Kim et al., 2017) and AD CSF biomarkers were analyzed using either the second generation Fujirebio Lumipulse immunoassay (Leitao et al., 2019) (Fujirebio, Malvern, PA) for more recent patients (n=9), or the Luminex xMap immuno assay (Luminex, Austin, TX). To determine high probability AD pathology, we applied established cutpoints for Fujirebio (amyloid-beta42: amyloid-beta40 ratio ≤ 0.058) and Luminex (phosphorylated-tau: amyloid-beta42 ratio &gt; 0.08) (Lleo et al., 2018).

2.3 Genetic Testing

We performed genetic testing on patient DNA samples based on pedigree analysis using a multiplexed panel for &gt;22 neurodegenerative disease associated genes, including MAPT (OMIM:157140) as described (Wood et al., 2013).

2.4 Clinical Assessments

All clinical assessments were performed masked to OCT data. Clinical data for use in this study was obtained from the Penn Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Database (INDD) (Xie et al., 2011). We selected global measures of disease severity relevant to the heterogeneous cognitive, behavioral and motor features of FTLD-Tau, (Irwin et al., 2015) including the Folstein Mini-Mental Examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating scale (CDR®) plus national Alzheimer’s disease coordinating center (NACC) frontotemporal dementia sum of boxes (CDRFTD), (Knopman et al., 2011) and the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale (PSPRS) (Golbe and Ohman-Strickland, 2007). Disease severity data obtained within 12 months of the OCT test date were used to evaluate their associations with OCT measures. All clinical assessments were performed masked to OCT data.

2.5 Neuropathologic Examination

Autopsy data available prior to analysis of study outcomes were obtained from the Penn Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Database. Briefly, autopsy was performed as described using modern immunohistochemistry techniques and diagnostic criteria (Mackenzie et al., 2010; Montine et al., 2012; Toledo et al., 2014).

2.6 Ophthalmic Evaluation, Imaging Protocol, and Image Analysis

Each patient had a full, dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist (BJK or TSA) to rule-out other eye diseases. Prior to statistical analysis, we also excluded patients or eyes with any disease involving the macula, hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, a retinal-vascular disease, optic nerve disease including glaucoma, high refractive error (≥ 6.00 or ≤ −6.00 diopter spherical equivalent, or known axial length of &gt; 26.5 mm), significant media opacity, intraocular eye surgery within 90 days of study enrollment, or poor OCT image quality. One patient in the pADNC group had a history of diabetes with no visible diabetic retinopathy on exam or OCT.

All patients had OCT imaging for both eyes with the Spectralis OCT system (Heidelberg Engineering, Franklin, MA, USA) at one of two Scheie Eye Institute locations using a standard macular volume scan protocol as previously described (Kim et al., 2017). Briefly, the high-resolution setting of the instrument was used to generate a 25-line raster scan covering a 20° area centered at the fovea with automated-real time averaging (ART, 25 scans per cross-sectional image). Analyzed images were in accordance with OSCAR-IB criteria for quality control of macula volume scans (Tewarie et al., 2012). A masked image analyst then used the automated and validated Iowa Reference Algorithm (version 3.8) to segment images; there were no image segmentation errors requiring correction (Garvin et al., 2009; Li et al., 2006). Retinal layer thicknesses were reported for the average of the central 5 regions (3 mm diameter area) of the standard ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study) grid centered on the fovea.

2.7 Statistical Analysis

We used generalized linear models to compare the thickness of retinal layers between pFTLD-Tau and pADNC patients. These models were performed without and with adjustment for age, sex, and race, as these variables can affect retinal layer thicknesses (Girkin et al., 2011; Kashani et al., 2010). Our comparisons focused on the layers of primary interest: retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and ONL. To assess the ability of the ONL to distinguish pFTLD-Tau from pADNC, we used logistic regression models to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). To account for the inter-eye correlation, we used clustered bootstrap to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) of AUC (Ying et al., 2021). We performed the Pearson correlation analysis to evaluate the correlation between ONL thickness and disease severity scale scores. For patients contributing two study eyes, the inter-eye correlation of thickness was accounted for using generalized estimating equations (Liang and Zeger, 1986; Ying et al., 2017); this approach of analyzing data from individual eyes and accounting for their inter-eye correlation is commonly used (Kim et al., 2017; Kleerekooper et al., 2022; Talman et al., 2010). We used the robust sandwich estimate by specifying independence covariance structure. The statistical analyses were performed in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Two-sided p &lt; 0.05 was defined as statistically significant.

3. Results

3.1 Patient Characteristics

A total of 24 pFTLD-Tau and 31 pADNC patients were enrolled and completed the protocol. After excluding patients or eyes for reasons shown in Figure 1, there were 21 pFTLD-Tau patients (33 eyes) and 24 pADNC patients (46 eyes) analyzed. The demographics of these patients are shown in Table 1. The pFTLD-Tau patients were about 5 years older than pADNC patients (66.0 vs. 61.2 years, p=0.03), and 71.4% of the pFTLD-Tau patients were females compared to 41.7% female for pADNC patients (p=0.045). There was no significant difference in race. There was no significant difference in visual acuity or intraocular pressure (Supplementary Tables 1–2).

The 21 analyzed pFTLD-Tau patients included 4 patients with a neuropathologic confirmation of FTLD-Tau. The 4 patients with FTLD-Tau neuropathology included 1 patient with a MAPT E10+16 C&gt;T mutation from prior genetic testing. There was an additional pFTLD-Tau patient without autopsy data that had a MAPT c.1216C&gt;T, p.R406W mutation. Clinical diagnoses of pFTLD-Tau patients are provided in Table 1.

All 24 pADNC patients had positive CSF biomarkers for AD (Supplementary Table 3) and were composed of patients typically seen by a center specialized in FTD, including non-amnestic clinical syndromes associated with ADNC. The clinical diagnoses for pADNC patients are provided in Table 1.

The pFTLD-Tau patients had a median MMSE score of 26.0 (interquartile range 24.0 – 28.0), a median CDR-FTD Sum of 7.5 (interquartile range 4.5 – 9.0), and a median PSP-RS score of 39.0 (interquartile range 24.5 – 43.0). The pADNC patients had a median MMSE score of 21.5 (interquartile range 16.5 – 25.0) and a median CDR-FTD Sum of 4.8 (interquartile range 3.0 – 7.5).

3.2 Retinal layer thicknesses of pADNC and pFTLD-Tau patients.

In the unadjusted analyses, the pFTLD-Tau patients had a thinner RNFL, GCL, and ONL (all p&lt;0.05) compared to pADNC patients (Table 2). The most significant differences for pADNC compared to pFTLD-Tau were for the ONL (95.9 vs. 87.4 μm, p&lt;0.001). Compared to pADNC patients after adjusting for demographics (age, sex, and race), only the ONL remained significantly thinner for pFTLD-Tau patients (95.7 for pADNC vs. 89.0 μm for pFTLD-Tau, p=0.02) (Table 2). The results for all retinal layers are shown in Supplementary Table 4. Next, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine if the ONL thinning of pFTLD-Tau patient was driven by the PSP patients. When comparing the PSP patients only to the pADNC patients, the ONL was the only retinal layer that was significantly different, but the p-value was larger (94.6 for pADNC vs. 89.3 for PSP, p=0.049 adjusting for age, sex, and race). Since there were few non-white patients, we also analyzed the data adjusting only for age and sex. In this analysis, the results were unchanged as the ONL was the only retinal layer that remained significantly different for pFTLD-Tau patients (95.1 for pADNC vs. 88.7 μm for pFTLD-Tau, p=0.02).

The pADNC and pFLTD-Tau patient groups were also compared to our previously reported group of recruited normal controls (Kim et al., 2017) with adjustment for age, sex, and race. Compared to controls, the pADNC patients did not have thinning of the RNFL, GCL, or ONL (all p&gt;0.30; data for demographics and all retinal layers shown in Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Table 6). Compared to controls, the pFTLD-Tau patients demonstrated findings similar to previously reported data with no thickness difference for RNFL (p=0.18) or GCL (p=0.35) but thinning of the ONL (95.4 for controls vs. 86.9 μm for pFTLD-Tau, p=0.001; data for demographics and for all retinal layers shown in Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Table 8) (Kim et al., 2017).

3.3 Receiver operating characteristic analysis

We evaluated whether the ONL could distinguish pFTLD-Tau from pADNC patients. The ROC analysis for discriminating pFTLD-Tau from pADNC patients using the ONL thickness found that the area under the curve was 0.78 (95% CI 0.64 – 0.89). The area under the curve remained similar when adjusting for demographics or the MMSE score, mildly improving to 0.85 (95% CI 0.72 – 0.94) with adjustment for MMSE (Table 3). Figure 2 shows the boxplot with the unadjusted ONL data point for each patient. ONL thickness &lt; 94 μm classified pFTLD-Tau vs. pADNC with 84.8% (95%CI 61.1–95.2) sensitivity and 60.9% (95%CI: 43.7–75.7) specificity (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 9).

3.4 Correlation of disease severity scales with ONL thickness

To determine the clinical relevance for our observations of ONL thinning in the pFTLD-Tau group, we performed correlation analyses between ONL thickness and global measures of severity for cognition, as well as behavior and motor function. We found moderate correlations of ONL thinning with worse performance on MMSE (r=0.46, p=0.03) and the CDR-FTD sum of boxes score (r=−0.33, p=0.04) in the pFTLD-Tau patients but not in the pADNC group (p&gt;0.51 for MMSE and CDR-FTD sum of boxes) (Table 4, see also Supplementary Figure 1 A–D for scatter plots). When evaluating the PSP-RS scale among the pFTLD-Tau patients, we found that the ONL thickness correlated negatively with the PSP-RS score (r=−0.65, p=0.005) (Table 4, Supplementary Figure 1E). We also found that the composite layers of outer retina and total retina were significantly correlated with these disease severity scales for the pFTLD-Tau group but not the pADNC group (Supplementary Table 10). However, when the outer retina thickness (composed of photoreceptor layers) was removed from the total retina thickness, there was no significant correlation with disease severity scales for both pFTLD-Tau and pADNC patients (Supplementary Table 11). When the ONL thickness was removed from the outer retina thickness, there was significant correlation with the CDR-FTD-sum of boxes score but not the MMSE or PSP-RS score for pFTLD-Tau patients, and there was no significant correlation with severity scales for pADNC patients (Supplementary Table 12).

4. Discussion

This study utilized a unique approach to study OCT measurements in a deeply-phenotyped cohort of patients with predicted/known FTLD-Tau compared to those with established biomarker evidence of ADNC. In addition to the CSF biomarkers for ADNC, our deep phenotyping approach included dilated eye exams of the retina by ophthalmologists specialized in retinal diseases, genetic testing, and autopsy data when available. Our findings demonstrated specificity for ONL thinning in pFTLD-Tau compared to clinically-similar patients with pADNC. Moreover, we find ONL thinning is related to multiple measures of global cognitive, behavioral and motor function in our pFTLD-Tau group. The findings support retinal photoreceptor loss linked to pathophysiological processes that may be unique to tauopathy in FTLD but not ADNC. Moreover, these data add to growing literature suggestive that OCT may be a useful non-invasive method to improve diagnosis and provide an urgently needed objective prognostic marker in FTLD-Tau.

Previous work in OCT as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease has focused primarily on clinical AD. There is significant and growing literature demonstrating inner retina (RNFL and GCL) loss in AD, although with some variability likely related to differences in patient selection and methodology (Chan et al., 2018; Hinton et al., 1986). Of note, a study specifically evaluating the outer retina did not find outer retina (photoreceptor) loss in AD (Uchida et al., 2018). Prior studies of relatively small groups of PSP without utilization of AD biomarkers have also had inconsistent findings, including varying results for RNFL and ONL loss (Albrecht et al., 2012; Picillo et al., 2022). Because of the risk of incorrect diagnosis, some recent studies of AD and related dementias are utilizing AD biomarkers to define disease groups, as we have done. One study evaluated multiple retinal layers for MCI and AD patients positive for 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B with positron emission tomography (PET). There was significant thinning of the RNFL and GCL layers in the MCI/AD patients compared to healthy controls, and the authors concluded that these layers could be useful as a biomarker for AD (Lopez-de-Eguileta et al., 2019). Another group compared cognitively normal individuals that were positive vs. negative for A-beta deposition using 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B PET. They found that the mean RNFL thickness was thinner among those positive for amyloid-beta deposition, while the GCL thickness correlated with the mean cortical thickness of AD signature regions (Byun et al., 2021). Finally, using an amyloid-beta42:tau CSF biomarker, others have reported that the RNFL thickness is thinner among cognitively normal individuals that are positive vs. negative for this biomarker, and that the RNFL thickness may be able to predict which individuals have a positive biomarker (Asanad et al., 2020). It is still unknown if inner retina thinning is a toxic effect of amyloid-beta retina deposition or a shared finding of neurodegenerative conditions perhaps related to global neuronal loss; studies of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, proganulin mutation patients, Parkinson’s, and multiple system atrophy have also found inner retina thinning (Mendoza-Santiesteban et al., 2015; Murueta-Goyena et al., 2021; Volpe et al., 2015; Ward et al., 2014). In contrast, our prior data has suggested that FTLD-Tau patients primarily have ONL thinning without significant inner retina loss compared to normal controls, and we now have shown critically important data indicating that ONL thinning may help to distinguish FTLD-Tau from ADNC (Kim et al., 2017). Thus, inner retina thinning is not clearly common to all neurodegenerative conditions, and different dementias can have specific retinal findings likely related to the underlying molecular pathology.

The correlation of the ONL thickness with the MMSE and CDR-FTD sum score was seen in pFTLD-Tau patients, but not pADNC patients, demonstrating specificity of our findings. Further the ONL thickness correlated with the PSP-RS among pFTLD-Tau patients. Evaluation of the grouped layers forming the outer retina and total retina (with and without the outer retina) also suggests that thinning of photoreceptor layers is related to pFTLD-Tau severity, and the ONL thickness is the single layer that broadly correlates with several severity sales. These data provide important converging evidence that atrophy of the photoreceptors, demonstrated best with the ONL thickness, is an important and specific biomarker for FTLD-Tau, as it correlates with several disease severity scales for pFTLD-Tau and this data is not replicated among pADNC patients. Instead, other studies have shown that the inner retina layers correlate with disease severity for AD and MCI patients (Almeida et al., 2019; Garcia-Martin et al., 2016). The cause of the ONL thinning of FTLD-Tau is not clear, but this data again suggests that it is likely linked to the underlying molecular pathology rather than secondary to generalized atrophy of neurons. Tau has been identified in photoreceptors (Aboelnour et al., 2017; Leger et al., 2011; Loffler et al., 1995). It is unknown if pathologic tau can spread from the brain to photoreceptors, but prion protein injected intracerebrally has been found to selectively deposit at photoreceptors (Striebel et al., 2021). Additionally, photoreceptors are known to be subjected to high levels of oxidative stress from light exposure and high metabolic activity. Among FTLD-Tau patients, the oxidative stress may contribute to toxic levels of phosphorylated tau, also explaining preferential injury to the ONL of photoreceptors rather than retinal ganglion cells of the inner retina (Fridlich et al., 2009). While AD has dysfunctional tau in addition to amyloid-beta abnormalities, the tauopathy of AD (consisting of both 3R and 4R tau isoforms in paired helical filaments) contrasts with the tauopathy typical of FTLD-Tau, which is often 3R or 4R tau alone with straight filaments (Irwin et al., 2015). These differences of molecular composition of tau inclusions, in addition to potentially toxic effects of amyloid-beta in AD, may explain the different retina findings.

Our pADNC cohort was unique compared to most previous OCT work in AD, as the majority were young-onset and many had atypical non-amnestic clinical presentations (Table 1). It is interesting that our pADNC population did not show inner retina thinning compared to normal controls. The absence of inner retina thinning may be related to the relatively young age of our pADNC population, and perhaps these patients will manifest inner retina thinning later in life. It is important to emphasize that atypical AD has been found to have distinct genetic risk and biomarker profiles compared to amnestic AD (Cousins et al., 2020; Rogalski et al., 2011). Thus, larger cross-sectional and longitudinal OCT studies in typical amnestic AD and non-amnestic atypical clinical variants of ADNC with autopsy validation are needed to fully understand the pathophysiology of retinal changes in ADNC. We acknowledge that there was mild, nonsignificant thinning of inner retina layers of our pFTLD-Tau patients compared to pADNC; this also requires further study in larger cohorts as our pFTLD-Tau patients had no suggestion of thinning for these layers compared to normal controls (Supplementary Table 5). Importantly, our correlation with clinical scales for FTLD-Tau suggest selective and clinically-relevant ONL thinning is a feature of FTLD-Tau.

The strengths of this study include the deep phenotyping of patients to define pADNC vs. pFTLD-Tau with dilated eye exams, CSF biomarkers, genetic testing, and including some patients diagnosed neuropathologically with FTLD-Tau. Given the potential similarity of clinical presentations for AD with FTD, deep phenotyping is paramount to the accuracy of biomarker studies in the absence of full autopsy validation. The AUC for the ONL thickness to distinguish pFTLD-Tau from pADNC was good, and the significance of this finding is emphasized by the correlation of the ONL thickness with disease severity scales for pFTLD-Tau but not for pADNC patients. Our finding that an ONL &lt; 94 μm has about 85% sensitivity for pFTLD-Tau vs. pADNC suggests that this could be a useful tool to help distinguish these diseases. In addition to retinal layer thicknesses, other aspects of retinal imaging such as vascular parameters of neurodegeneration have potential as biomarkers (Cheung et al., 2021; Elahi et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021; Yoon et al., 2019). It’s possible that the ONL thickness would best be used as part of a multiple biomarker model to evaluate patients prior to more invasive measures (Wisely et al., 2020). Further, while many of our patients did not have amnestic AD, these were patients presenting to a specialized FTD center, thus forming a group of patients for which the distinction of AD vs. FTLD-Tau is critical when considering potential tau mechanism-based therapy development.

The primary limitation of this study is the relatively limited sample size of a heterogenous rare disorder. Even with a limited sample size, we found a significant difference in ONL thickness between pFTLD-Tau and pADNC patients. While we used both eyes from the same patient if criteria were met, this is an accepted analysis method for eye data (Kim et al., 2017; Kleerekooper et al., 2022; Talman et al., 2010; Ying et al., 2017). Another potential limitation is that the majority of our pFTLD-Tau patients had PSP and a minority had bvFTD or other forms of FTD. However, a sensitivity analysis of only the PSP patients compared to pADNC suggested that our results were from ONL thinning across the whole pFTLD-Tau group; results were not just driven by the PSP patients. Furthermore, we have previously reported data for a bvFTD patient with a MAPT mutation and a PSP patient that were both imaged with OCT during life and followed to autopsy with retinal tissue analysis (Kim et al., 2021). In this report, both the bvFTD and the PSP patients showed FTLD-Tau pathology and had in vivo OCT showing ONL loss during life that was validated by areas of ONL loss seen with retinal tissue analysis. Therefore, it is likely that our data is representative not only for PSP, but for patients with FTLD-Tau. Additionally, while we focused on amnestic and non-amnestic clinical syndromes predictive of underlying ADNC (i.e. posterior cortical atrophy, corticobasal syndrome, logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia) with biomarker evidence of ADNC, we lacked autopsy and cannot entirely rule out mixed FTLD and AD pathology in some individuals; however, we believe this would be uncommon, especially given the relatively young age of the patients (Ossenkoppele et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2018). Finally, we cannot comment on whether ONL thickness may distinguish FTLD-Tau from FTLD-TDP, but a study has suggested FTLD-TDP has inner retina thinning (Ward et al., 2014). Thus, further investigations are needed to test generalizability of our findings by evaluating more clinical subtypes of FTLD-Tau patients and to directly compare retinal layer thicknesses of FTLD-Tau and FTLD-TDP.

Biomarkers to distinguish FTLD-Tau from AD are urgently needed, and we have presented novel data indicating that quick, noninvasive OCT retinal imaging with ONL thickness measurements has notable potential as a biomarker for FTLD-Tau. Additional studies with larger groups and autopsy with neuropathologic validation are next steps needed to develop this putative biomarker.

Highlights

Biomarkers are needed for frontotemporal lobar degeneration tauopathy (FTLD-Tau).

Photoreceptor outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning may be a specific dementia marker.

Predicted FTLD-Tau patients had a thinner ONL compared to Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

For predicted FTLD-Tau vs. AD, inner retina layers were not significantly different.

ONL thickness correlated with disease severity scores for FTLD-Tau but not AD.
