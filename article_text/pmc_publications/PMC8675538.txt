BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:

There are growing concerns about the safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We sought to examine associations between psychotropic medication exposure and longitudinal change in cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric outcomes in a large clinical AD cohort.

DESIGN:

Longitudinal observational study.

SETTING:

National Alzheimer’s Disease Coordinating Center combining data from 39 Alzheimer’s disease centers.

PARTICIPANTS:

8,034 participants with AD dementia.

MEASUREMENTS:

Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) Total. Probability of exposure to medication (the propensity score, PS) calculated via logistic regression. Medication classes included all antipsychotics (atypical vs conventional), antidepressants (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor [SSRI] vs non-SSRI), and benzodiazepines. Participants treated with a medication class were matched with participants not treated with that class with the closest-matched PS. The effect of medication treatment was assessed using linear mixed-effects models.

RESULTS:

Participants had a mean (SD) age of 75.5 (9.8) years, and mean (SD) scores of MMSE 21.3 (5.7), CDR-SB 5.5 (3.4), and NPI-Q Total 4.5 (4.4). Mean duration of follow-up was 2.9–3.3 years depending on medication class. Non-SSRI antidepressant use was associated with better CDR-SB (2-year difference in change-DIC: −0.38 [−0.61, −0.15], P = .001). Atypical antipsychotic use was associated with greater decline on MMSE (DIC: −0.91 [−1.54, −0.28] P = .005) and CDR-SB scores (DIC: 0.50 [0.14, 0.86], P = .006). Notably, no drug class was associated with better NPI-Q scores.

CONCLUSIONS:

Use of atypical antipsychotics was associated with poorer cognition and function, and no drug class was associated with improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) are some of the earliest clinical symptoms preceding the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). NPS may start as early as 20 years before the cognitive problems become clinically evident,1 with close to 60% of the individuals developing NPS before diagnosis of any cognitive disorder.2 NPSs remain prevalent and persistent after the onset of AD, with up to 97% of individuals suffering at least one NPS over the disease course.3 NPSs are detrimental to patients and caregivers, as they are associated with more rapid cognitive and functional decline, worse quality of life, greater caregiver burden, and earlier institutionalization.4–7

Due to the high prevalence of NPSs, psychotropic medications are widely prescribed in AD.3,8,9 However, since none are FDA-approved for NPS in AD, this raises concerns about safety and efficacy of these medications. Antidepressants might theoretically improve prognosis of depression in AD, as disruption in monoaminergic system is observed in humans10 and in animal models of AD.11 One randomized controlled trial (RCT) of citalopram for agitation in AD reported benefit,12 whereas other RCTs of antidepressants for depression in AD have reported null results.13–15 However, there are significant concerns about antidepressant safety including hyponatremia,16 impaired platelet function, prolonged QT interval,17 and drug–drug interactions.

Although there has been a steady decline in antipsychotic use since the FDA issued black box warnings for antipsychotics, antipsychotic use is still not infrequent among patients with dementia.18 A meta-analysis concluded that the evidence for antipsychotic efficacy for treatment of NPS in AD is modest at best,19 and a well-powered effectiveness study reported modest symptom improvement20 but also adverse metabolic effects including weight gain.21 Antipsychotic use raises concerns about extrapyramidal symptoms, tardive dyskinesia, hip fracture,22 and increased mortality23,24 with an estimate of the number needed to harm (NNH) for mortality ranging from 26 to 50.25 Benzodiazepine use has also been associated with risk of dependence, worsening cognitive impairment including increased risk of incident AD as well as mortality.26,27

Although many RCTs of psychotropic medications in AD report benefit most are short term (&lt; 12 weeks). Many patients with AD are treated with psychotropic medications for much longer duration and thus in order to determine the long-term effects of medications, it is necessary to use observational data. Observational studies have reported mixed results on the associations between psychotropic medication use and trajectory of AD outcomes, with some studies linking antipsychotic and benzodiazepine exposure to poorer outcomes28,29 and others reporting no association.13,15,30

We have previously reported associations between psychotropic medication exposure and poorer cognitive, functional, or neuropsychiatric outcomes in a population-based sample of 230 incident AD cases followed for a mean of 3.7 years.8 These results were intriguing but might be explained as “confounding by indication.” NPSs are known to be associated with a more rapid rate of functional decline and institutionalization in AD31 and thus the group of patients prescribed psychotropic medications may be at risk of poorer outcomes and not well matched to those patients not prescribed these medications. One method to manage this potential bias is propensity score matching.32 This method reduces the bias of confounding by indication by matching medication-exposed participants to non-exposed participants on observed clinical characteristics associated with medication exposure. Participants who used medications are matched by propensity to use that medication to individuals with similar propensities but who did not take that medication, and outcomes are assessed longitudinally. Our aim was to determine if exposure to antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines in AD would be associated with poorer cognitive, functional, or neuropsychiatric outcomes over time.

METHODS

The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) is responsible for developing and maintaining a database housing data collected at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) funded by the National Institute on Aging. All participants or their legally authorized representatives signed informed consent before participation. The Institutional Review Board overseeing each ADRC approved local procedures. We used data collected from 39 Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) from 2005 through the March 2020 data freeze, which contained data from February 2020 and before.

Participants and Study Design

Participants were assigned a diagnosis at each examination adjudicated by an experienced clinician or an interdisciplinary team.33 Participants were included in further data analyses if they had diagnoses of probable or possible AD dementia, at least one post-diagnosis follow-up visit and were not missing any of the variables used for propensity score calculation. Only visits after dementia diagnosis were included in the analysis. Participants were followed approximately annually with the Uniform Data Set clinical and cognitive assessment.33

Measures

Psychotropic Medication Exposure

We classified antidepressants as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) versus non-SSRIs and antipsychotics as atypical8 versus conventional antipsychotics (Supplementary Table S1a). We also listed a list of frequently used medications in each classification (Supplementary Table S1b) as well as the number of follow-up visits and duration of follow-up for each classification (Supplementary Table S2).

We summarized drug exposure by calculating the Persistency Index (PI) for antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines as the proportion of observed time of medication exposure.34,35 PI represents the ratio of the duration of medication exposure (for an individual participant) to the total duration of observation for that participant and ranges from 0 to 1. As we did not have information on medication exposure between visits, if a person was taking a medication at consecutive visits, we assumed he/she was taking it over the entire time period between these visits. If an individual was taking the medication at one visit but not at the next consecutive visit, we estimated the duration of medication exposure was half the time between visits. A PI was calculated separately for each psychotropic medication class. For purposes of matching by propensity score, we defined a dichotomous variable “treatment status” as “treated” if PI&gt;0.3 (i.e., exposure to that particular medication during 30% or more of the observation period) versus “untreated” if PI = 0 (i.e., no exposure to that medication during the observation period). This dichotomization included &gt;94% of AD participants with at least one follow-up, that is, fewer than 6% of participants had 0 &lt; PI≤0.3 for any medication class. To assess whether our findings varied as a function of choice of PI cutoff, we performed sensitivity analyses using alternative PI cutoffs to define “treatment status” (0.1 and 0.5). Most of the participants who fell in the 0 &lt; PI≤0.3 category were included in the sensitivity analysis with PI cutoff of 0.1.

Outcomes

Mini-Mental State Exam

The MMSE36 is a 30-point measure of general cognitive status widely used in assessment of global cognition in research. The MMSE has been incorporated in the UDS since its inception to 2015. Since 2015, the NACC has begun administering the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)37 rather than the MMSE. We used a crosswalk tool38 to derive MMSE scores for individuals with MoCA scores. This represented 15% of the total number of person-visits in the analytic sample.

CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument

Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)39 is a widely used rating of global function in dementia with excellent reliability and validity.40 CDR characterizes six domains of cognitive and functional performance: memory, orientation, judgment, community, hobbies, and personal care. CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is the sum of individual ratings (range 0–3) in each of the six domains, with maximum score of 18. CDR-SB has demonstrated sensitivity to functional changes in AD.41

Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)

The NPI-Q42,43 is a short questionnaire version of NPI, a widely used measure of NPS that assesses type and severity of NPS in people with memory disorders. NPI-Q is administered to a knowledgeable informant who rates severity (range 0–3) in 12 neuropsychiatric domains. These domains include hallucinations, delusions, agitation/aggression, dysphoric/depression, anxiety, irritability, disinhibition, euphoria, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, appetite/weight changes, and sleep disturbance. We report severity for each domain and summed 12 domains to calculate NPI-Q Total (range 0–36).

Covariates

The following variables were included in the analyses and used for propensity score matching: baseline age, sex, education, baseline MMSE, CDR-SB, NPI-Q Total, and use of AD medications (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine).

Propensity Score Matching

Propensity scores (PS) were calculated for each participant, via logistic regression, as the predicted probability of being in the “treated” (PI &gt; 0.3) group versus the “untreated” (PI = 0) group as a function of the covariates listed above. This was done separately for each drug class. For each treated individual, we used nearest neighbor matching via the R package MatchIt,44 selecting the single untreated individual with the closest matching PS. Untreated individuals could only be selected as a match once. To assess the balance (similarity) of covariates between the treated and untreated groups, we calculated the “standardized bias.”32 This standardized bias was calculated by taking the difference in means of each covariate (for continuous variables) or the difference in proportions of each level (for categorical covariates) between the treated and untreated participants and dividing by the standard deviation of that covariate. This was done on the original samples as well as the matched samples. The standardized bias after matching indicates the similarity of the matched treated and untreated subjects. Perfect matching would be indicated by a standardized bias of 0; typically values &lt;0.25 in absolute value are considered acceptable.32

Data Analyses

MMSE, CDR-SB, and NPI-Q Total scores over time were modeled using the matched samples with linear mixed effects models with a random intercept using STATA v15.45 These models included terms for treatment (PI), time (in years), and treatment by time interactions. Because we observed significant non-linear time effects on outcomes, we also included quadratic terms (time2) and treatment by time2 interactions. The following covariates were included in all models, based on the literature and previous analyses with this dataset: baseline age, female sex, education (in years), and use of dementia medication (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine). The coefficients of interest were PI*time and PI*time2 and the null hypothesis that both coefficients were 0 was tested via a Wald test with two degrees of freedom. Time and age at baseline were coded in years, and binary variables coded as 0/1. Alpha = 0.05/3 = 0.017 was used as the threshold for statistical significance, to account multiple testing due to the three outcomes. To more clearly communicate the magnitude of the joint effects of PI*time and PI*time2, we also calculated expected change over 2 years for individuals considered “treated” (PI &gt; 0.3) and “untreated” (PI = 0).

Sensitivity Analyses

As a sensitivity analysis, we also calculated sample-based average treatment effects (ATE) using nearest-neighbor matching and bias correction as implemented in the STATA package nmatch.46 This method estimates the ATE by calculating, for each person, the difference between the effect they experienced and the counterfactual effect they would have experienced had they had the other treatment, which is estimated from matched participants.46 These analyses treated medication use as a dichotomous variable and used annual rate of change rather than both linear and quadratic time effects as in the mixed effects models.

RESULTS

Clinical Characteristics

Of 42,661 NACC participants, 14,279 subjects had diagnoses of possible or probable AD and 8,850 had at least one follow-up visit at the time of data freeze. As possible or probable AD is not captured in UDS version 3, so this criteria may exclude participants who received an AD diagnosis at an UDSv3 visit. Individuals without follow-up were older at their AD baseline by about 1 year, were more likely to be female (58% vs 54%), slightly less educated, had lower baseline MMSE scores and higher CDR-SB and NPI-Q scores, and were less likely to be taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (54% vs 60%).

There were 8,034 participants that had complete data at baseline (necessary for calculation of propensity scores) and were included in the analytic sample. Approximately 6% were missing baseline MMSE/MoCA, 3% were missing baseline NPI-Q, and 1% were missing education. Individuals who were missing one or more of these variables were more likely to be female (61% vs 53%), had lower MMSE and had higher CDR-SB and NPI-Q scores, were less likely to be taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (49% vs 62%). Since incorporation of missing data imputation into propensity score analysis is still an active area of methodological research,47 we decided not to impute the relatively small amount of missing data for these participants.

Baseline characteristics of the analytic sample are presented in Table 1 and psychotropic medication use in Table 2. Throughout the study, antidepressants were used by 3,975 (50%), antipsychotics by 999 (12%), and benzodiazepines by 811 (10%). Table 2 also shows how many participants had PIs of either 0 or &gt; 0.3 and were used for propensity score matched analyses.

PS Matching

The number of pairs of matched participants with at least one follow-up visit ranged from 33 for typical antipsychotics to 3,520 for antidepressants. The mean number of visits ranged from 3.4 to 3.9, and the mean duration of follow-up from 2.3 to 3.3 years. PS matching between the treatment groups yielded groups with similar distributions of propensity scores (Supplementary Figure S1). With the sole exception for baseline age for antidepressants (0.35), standardized bias was reduced to below 0.25 after matching for each covariate in each drug class analysis (Supplementary Figure S2).

Effect of Medication Treatment on MMSE, CDR-SB, and NPI-Q Total

Linear mixed-effects models of MMSE, CDR-SB, and NPI-Q Total are summarized in Table 3. For brevity, only the interactions of time and time2 with PI are presented in Table 3.

Analogous model results without propensity score matching are found in Supplementary Table S3.

In order to convey the magnitude and direction of associations between medications and outcomes, we used the model estimates to calculate fitted outcomes at specific time points. Table 4 presents differences in fitted 2-year changes (DIC) in MMSE, CDR-SB, and NPI-Q Total based on the models in Table 3. Non-SSRI antidepressant use was associated with better CDR-SB (slower rate of increase) (DIC: −0.38 [−0.61, −0.15], P = .001); users are expected to gain 2.99 (2.82, 3.17) and nonusers 3.37 (3.24, 3.51) points over 2 years. Atypical antipsychotic use was associated with more rapid decline on MMSE scores (DIC: −0.91 [−1.54, −0.28] P = .005); users are expected to lose −4.97 (−5.45, −4.50) and nonusers −4.06 (−4.40,-3.73) points over 2 years. In addition, atypical antipsychotic use was also associated with worse CDR-SB scores (DIC: 0.50 [0.14, 0.86] P = .006), with users expected to gain 3.76 (3.50, 4.02) points and nonusers 3.26 (3.07, 3.44) points over 2 years. Notably, no drug class was associated with better NPI-Q scores.

The inferences were generally insensitive to the choice of PI cutoff: utilizing alternative PI cutoffs of PI &gt; 0.1 (Supplementary Table S4) and PI &gt; 0.5 (Supplementary Table S5).

Average Treatment Effect (ATE) analyses48 performed for sensitivity were also largely consistent with the primary analysis with regard to direction and magnitude of effects, though the negative effects of atypical antipsychotics did not reach statistical significance (Supplementary Table S6).

DISCUSSION

In a large cohort of community-dwelling AD participants followed longitudinally, exposure to atypical antipsychotics was associated with more rapid decline in cognition and increase in dementia severity, and non-SSRI antidepressants were associated with slower rate of increase in dementia severity. Importantly, none of these medications were associated with improvements in neuropsychiatric symptom scores. We were able to substantially reduce bias due to observed covariates for all medication classes. Additionally, the results were generally insensitive to choice of PI cutoff. Thus, the observed associations were robust across multiple sensitivity analyses.

These results support the hypothesis that atypical antipsychotic medication use in AD is associated with poorer prognosis in multiple domains and that none of these medications are associated with improvements in neuropsychiatric symptoms as we have previously reported,8 even after using PS matching to minimize the effects of confounding by indication. Relatively little is known about biological mechanisms underlying these associations although possibilities are suggested by the literature. Antipsychotics are associated with cerebrovascular events,49 which might further affect cognition, function, and behavior. Our results differ from our previous report from the Dementia Progression Study8 in that we did not find associations between antidepressant use and poorer dementia severity, but are consistent with the report that antidepressant use was not associated with poorer cognitive outcomes in a non-dementia population.50 The finding that non-SSRI antidepressants were associated with better outcomes is novel, to our knowledge, but given the heterogeneity of this class one cannot draw any conclusions about potential mechanisms. Finally, although we did not detect statistically significant impact of benzodiazepines on cognition and dementia severity in this study, it is important to point out that benzodiazepines are associated with increased risk of harm in older adults including increased risk of hip fracture, stroke, and mortality.27,51,52 Therefore, caution needs to be exercised in benzodiazepine use.

Although antipsychotics were not associated with improvement in NPS in our study, there have been other studies that have shown improvement in NPS with antipsychotic use. One study showed that risperidone was effective in treating psychosis and aggression,53 another showed increased risk of recurrent psychosis or agitation-aggression after risperidone discontinuation,54 and another showed improvement of NPS with olanzapine.55 Some of these studies were conducted among residents of long-term care facilities, and most likely involved more advanced dementia with behavioral problems. Therefore, there may be indication for the use of antipsychotics in certain clinical situations. However it is important to keep in mind that these studies were short term (10–32 weeks), and long-term outcomes were not assessed. In the future, a more targeted pharmacological approach to treating NPS would be important in reducing NPS while minimizing harm.56

There are several limitations to the dataset and analysis. Although RCTs are the most rigorous method for assessing the effects of medications, for ethical and practical reasons it would be impossible to conduct a large, multidrug RCT with the sample size and length of observation that are available to us in the NACC. In this study, PS matching successfully reduced bias from observed confounding variables. However, the major limitation of PS models is that at best this method constructs a dataset similar to a trial (“pseudotrial”) but can only account for bias due to known observed clinical variables, and not for unknown (or unobserved) variables, whereas randomization in an RCT would preclude confounding by both observed and unobserved variables. On balance, we would argue that the increased length of observation, increased sample size, and more “real world” sample we describe outweigh the possibility of unmeasured confounding and associated effects.

Another potential limitation is the use of a summary measure of medication exposure. The persistency index (PI) estimates the duration of exposure but we lackeddetailed data to examine dose effects or whether exposure at sequential time points reflected continuous exposure. Medication exposure was determined by self-report, not direct inspection of medication bottles or direct observation of adherence. However many studies have been deemed valid that rely on measures of medication exposure where there is no direct observation of use or inspection of medication bottles, including those based on administrative data,57,58 and even in RCTs, it is not typical for medication use to be observed directly.

We considered use of medications individually and did not account for their use in combination, though polypharmacy is the rule rather than the exception in older individuals. In our sample, the mean (SD) number of medications at baseline was 6.3 (3.8). Of the 3,049 participants taking an antidepressant at baseline, 7.8% were also taking an antipsychotic, and related to this of the 388 taking an antipsychotic at baseline, 61.3% were also taking an antidepressant. We did not attempt to consider two- or three-way combinations largely because even if the combinations of psychotropic medications are determined at baseline, different psychotropic medications are added and subtracted over time. Therefore, the number of combinations would render analyses impractical and there is no straightforward way to summarize exposure to multiple medications when exposure will vary separately over time for each medication. We also could not separate medications used “as needed” (“PRN”). However the largest group of medications were antidepressants, which are less likely to be taken on PRN basis. Finally, we measured cognition, dementia severity, and neuropsychiatric symptoms each with a single instrument. Cognition, in particular, was assessed with the MMSE, and later the MoCA, both measures of global cognitive functioning rather than providing an in-depth assessment of cognitive functioning.

These results suggest that exposure to atypical antipsychotics is associated with poorer outcomes in AD, and that none of the medications were associated with improvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms. At the very least, this implies that the clinical threshold for prescribing psychotropic medications should be relatively high particularly for mildly symptomatic community-dwelling patients such as NACC participants. It is possible that greater clinical benefit from psychotropic medication exposure might be seen with a more symptomatic cohort or a more focused targeting of medications to symptom profiles. Highly symptomatic patients may be more characteristic of residents of long-term care facilities, for example. These results highlight the importance of using nonpharmacologic strategies for psychiatric symptoms and behavior management in dementia, a field in which there is considerable recent innovation.59,60

CONCLUSION

In summary, in a large community-dwelling AD cohort treatment with atypical antipsychotics was associated with poorer cognitive and function outcomes and no class of psychotropic medication was associated with better neuropsychiatric symptoms. These findings support and strengthen the findings from our prior report8 and of others29,61 and suggest that clinicians should be cautious in prescribing psychotropic medications and particularly atypical antipsychotics to patients with AD.

Note: The expected difference in change by treatment on each outcome outcomes was calculated from the parameter estimates summarized in Table 3. For example, after 2 years, an individual taking an antidepressant would be expected to have declined 0.029 points less on the MMSE than an individual not taking an antidepressant. 95% CI and P-values are presented for each comparison. Alpha = 0.05/3 = 0.017 was used as the threshold for statistical significance (in bold), to account multiple testing due to the three outcomes.
