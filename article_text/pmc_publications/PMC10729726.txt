INTRODUCTION:

Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with improved health and survival. Less is known about its association with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).

METHODS:

We identified 649,605 US Veterans 30–95 years free of ADRD who completed a standardized exercise tolerance test between 2000 and 2017 with no evidence of ischemia. We examined the association between five age-and-gender-specific CRF categories and ADRD incidence using multivariate Cox regression models.

RESULTS:

During up to 20 (median 8.3) years of follow-up, incident ADRD occurred in 44,105 (6.8%) participants, with an incident rate of 7.7/1,000 person-years. Compared to the Least-fit, multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident ADRD were: 0.87 (0.85–0.90), 0.80 (0.78–0.83), 0.74 (0.72–0.76) and 0.67 (0.65–0.70), for Low-fit, Moderate-fit, Fit, and High-fit individuals, respectively.

DISSCUSSION:

These findings demonstrate an independent, inverse, and graded association between CRF and incident ADRD. Future studies may determine the amount and duration of physical activity needed to optimize ADRD risk reduction.

pmcBACKGROUND:

It is likely that the greatest impact on outcomes in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) will involve prevention strategies implemented in the preclinical and/or early stages of diseases. Precisely quantifying modifiable risk biomarkers is critical to designing individualized actionable preventive care plans. An alternative approach to the gold-standard randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial is to assess large datasets that include plausible preclinical biomarkers of risk when blinding and/or placebo are not achievable. We present one such approach involving cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as a putative biomarker of the modifiable risk of ADRD.

ADRD remains a leading cause of death posing serious threats to America’s long-term health and economic stability. 1–4 An estimated 6 million Americans suffer from ADRD, and prevalence is projected to double by 2050. 3,5 Treatment strategies involve supportive care, symptomatic drugs, and one disease-modifying therapy under national coverage determination evaluation (NDE). Supportive care is manpower intensive. Symptom-modifying drugs are of limited benefit and none has been approved since 2003. 6 Aducanumab, a medication that was recently approved as a disease modifier, has no reliable effect on clinical outcomes. 7 The paucity of progress in finding disease-modifying therapies for ADRD so far, highlights the need for further research aimed at ADRD prevention.

Prevention strategies can involve pharmaceutical products and/or health promotion measures. Pharmaceutical products are readily quantifiable for dose-response and many are being evaluated. 8 The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care identified 12 risk factors that account for around 40% of worldwide modifiable dementias and physical inactivity was one of the factors. 9 The National Institute on Aging has also identified physical activity as the only lifestyle intervention with strong evidence of mechanistic plausibility to prevent ADRD. 10 Evidence from clinical trials that assessed the effect of physical activity interventions typically had short follow-ups (≤2 years) and relatively small sample sizes (e.g n&lt;200). Some studies provide encouraging data. 11–14 However, measuring exercise is hampered by its episodic nature, and recall of physical activity levels can be unreliable. 15 Precisely quantifying modifiable risk factors is critical to designing individualized actionable preventive care plans. CRF was assessed objectively by an exercise treadmill test (ETT) and expressed in metabolic equivalents (METs; 1 MET=3.5 ml of oxygen/kg of body weight/minute). One MET represents the energy demand of an individual at rest. It is a reliable and reproducible measure that can be used to track an individual’s status at any point in time and longitudinally. Physical activity and CRF have an established role in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, other morbidities, and mortality. 16–24 Despite the strong evidence of CRF and health outcomes, the CRF-ADRD association has not been established. 10,25,26

In the current study, we examined the association between CRF expressed in METs and incident ADRD in a large national cohort of US Veterans during up to 20 years of follow-up (median 8.3 years).

METHODS:

Data Source and Study Sample

We identified 975,214 Veterans who completed at least one ETT with results during 2000–2017 from the unstructured clinical notes in the Veterans Affairs (VA) national electronic health records. This study has received an Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption #1576748–1 from the Washington DC VA IRB. We restricted our cohort to 855,441 Veterans who had at least one valid metabolic equivalent task (MET) value between 2.0 and 23.9. We excluded Veterans with baseline ADRD (n=22,633) or severe mental illnesses (n=55,402). We also excluded patients with (1) &lt;30 and &gt;95 years of age, (2) ≥50 years with ≥20 METs due to the unlikeliness for patients who are older than 50 years to reach higher than 20 METs 27, (3) weight &gt;450 pounds, (4) body mass index (BMI) &lt;18.5 kg/m2 because patients with BMI &lt;18.5 are likely to be cachectic. (5) coronary revascularization within 3 months after ETT, (6) myocardial infarction and/or heart failure diagnosis 1 month prior and 3 months after ETT, (7) pacemaker use, and/or (8) inconsistent death dates. The final cohort consisted of 649,605 individuals (Figure 1).

Cardiorespiratory Fitness

We used a natural language processing (NLP) tool based on a Regular Expression Discovery Extractor (REDEx) algorithm to identify and extract MET values from ETT data. 28 The NLP tool was trained and tested on a set of 2,701 manually annotated text snippets. It achieved 89% accuracy and 86% F-measure. 29 We then applied it to all notes containing a list of keywords: “METs”, “treadmill”, “grade”, “speed”, “exercise time”, and “VO2” and exercise protocol (“Bruce”, “Naughton”, “Balke”, etc.). Using an approach developed by us and described elsewhere, 30 we stratified the cohort into 5 CRF categories based on age-and-sex-specific peak METs achieved: Least-fit (n=132,634; METs=3.8±0.6), Low-fit (n=129,493; METs=5.8±1.4), Moderate-fit (n=120,988; METs=7.5±1.5), Fit (n=137,122; METs=9.2±1.7) and High-Fit (n=129,368; METs=11.7±2.1; Figure 1). Detailed information on cutoffs for CRF by gender and age is provided in Appendix I.

Other Covariates

Baseline covariates included demographics, chronic comorbid conditions, and concurrent medications. Chronic comorbid conditions were confirmed using International Classification of Diseases Version 9 and 10 (ICD9/10) diagnostic codes. Concurrent medications were identified from the data of prescription history within 1 year before the index date (including the index date). All data were at the individual level, except for the income data, which was median income data at the zip code level based on the census data. 31

Outcomes

The outcome of the study was ADRD incidence identified using ICD 9 and 10 codes. We required that ADRD diagnoses were recorded for at least two different encounters and the first date of ADRD diagnosis was used as the “event” date. 32 Time to events was calculated from the date of ETT to the incidence of ADRD. Patients who did not develop ADRD were censored at the date of death, last encounter date, or December 31, 2019, whichever occurred first.

Statistical Analyses

For baseline characteristics, continuous variables were presented as means (standard deviations) and categorical variables as frequency (%). Chi-square and analysis of variance tests were used for descriptive analyses as appropriate. The absolute standardized difference (ASD) between each of the higher CRF groups and the Least-fit group was also calculated to estimate the imbalanced characteristics between the groups, for which ASD &gt;10% indicated imbalance. 33 ADRD incidence rate was calculated as the number of patients who developed ADRD divided by the total person-years of patients at risk of ADRD. The incidence rates were estimated for the overall cohort as well as for gender and race/ethnicity subgroups. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident ADRD with CRF level in three different ways: 1) unadjusted, 2) adjusted with age, race, and sex, and 3) additional adjustment for marital status, region, living area median income category, body mass index, and comorbid conditions and medications listed in Table 1. The interactions between CRF and other baseline variables were also checked. The proportional hazard assumption was checked by visual inspection of the log-minus-log plots. We then repeated our analysis in a propensity score-matched cohort of 393,625 Veterans, using an approach described by Rassen et al.34 with 78,725 Veterans in each of the 5 fitness groups, who were balanced on 22 baseline characteristics included in Table 1 except for METs values. In an RCT, patients or participants have a 50% probability of receiving an exposure or treatment, which ensures that the two exposures or treatment groups are balanced on all measured and unmeasured baseline characteristics. In an observational study, the probability of receiving an exposure or treatment would vary but can be estimated as propensity scores. In turn, propensity scores can be used to assemble a matched cohort while remaining blinded to outcomes, a key feature of RCTs. In RCTs, study participants are expected to be balanced on measured baseline characteristics. Although propensity score-matching cannot ensure the balance of unmeasured baseline characteristics, sensitivity analysis can estimate the impact of an unmeasured confounder on the association observed in the matched cohort.

RESULTS:

Baseline Characteristics

The 649,605 Veterans included in the study had a mean age of 60.5 (±11.1), 5.7% were women, 16.6% were African Americans, and 5.4% were Hispanics. Participants from the Least-fit to the High-fit categories had mean METs of 3.8, 5.8, 7.5, 9.2, and 11.7, respectively (Table 1). As shown in Table 1, baseline characteristics were more favorable across ordered fitness categories (p&lt;0.0001 for all). Baseline characteristics of the 5 fitness categories in the propensity score-matched cohort are reported in Appendix II.

CRF and ADRD

Overall, there were 44,105 cases of ADRD (7.7/1,000 person-years) diagnosed during up to 20 years of follow-up (average 8. 8, SD±4.5; median 8.3, Q1–Q3 5.1–12.0). Participants from the Least-fit to the High-fit categories had ADRD crude incidence rates of 9.5, 8.5, 7.4, 7.2, and 6.4 per 1,000 person-years of follow-up, respectively (p&lt;0.0001) (Table 2). There was no evidence of proportional hazards assumption violation in log-minus-log plots (Appendix III). The unadjusted, and age-sex-race-adjusted models are shown in Table 2. In the multivariable-adjusted Cox regression model, with the Least-fit group as the reference, hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for incident ADRD for the Low-fit to the High-fit CRF categories were: 0.87 (0.85 to 0.90; p&lt;0.0001), 0.80 (0.78 to 0.83; p&lt;0.0001), 0.74 (0.72 to 0.76; p&lt;0.0001) and 0.67 (0.65 to 0.70; p&lt;0.0001), respectively (Table 2). The HRs and 95% CIs for 78,725 propensity score-matched Veterans in each of the 4 CRF categories were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.98; p&lt;0.0001), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82 to 0.89; p&lt;0.0001), 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.85; p&lt;0.0001), and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78; p&lt;0.0001) for the Low-fit to High-fit CRF categories, respectively (Appendix IV). Kaplan Meier plots of unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models show the cumulative probability of Veterans in each fitness group remaining ADRD-free during up to 20 years of follow-up (Figure 2a and 2b). Kaplan Meier plots of the propensity score-matched balanced cohort associations of CRF with ADRD are displayed in Appendix V. Both Figure 2 and Appendix 5 suggest that the probability of developing ADRD is inversely associated with CRF status.

The crude incidence rates of ADRD increased age substantially, with the trend of an increased level of CRF associated with a decreased incidence rate of ADRD (Appendix VI). Age-adjusted incidence rates of ADRD were numerically higher in men than in women, and in African Americans than in Whites; however, Asian Americans had relatively lower incident rates of ADRD than other racial groups (Appendix VII). Multivariable-adjusted associations between different fitness categories and incident ADRD by sex and race/ethnicity are displayed in Figure 3 and Appendix VIII. The sensitivity analyses based on different age groups are presented in Appendix IX. Associations with other clinically relevant subgroups including body mass index and morbidities identified by the significant interactions between CRF and baseline characteristics are displayed in Appendix X.

DISCUSSION:

Findings from our study demonstrate that CRF was independently associated with a lower risk of incident ADRD and that the association was graded in nature so that a higher level of fitness was associated with a lower level of risk. The multivariable-adjusted estimates, validated in a propensity score-matched balanced cohort, indicated that relative to the ADRD risk in individuals in the Least-fit group, the risk was significantly lower in those in the Low-fit group, and incrementally dropped to a greater lower risk in the High-fit group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study of an association between objectively determined CRF and risk of ADRD during up to two decades of follow-up. These findings provide evidence to include ADRD prevention in the list of health benefits of CRF.

There are several potential mechanistic explanations of the health benefits of CRF including suppression of inflammation and neurohormonal stress that help improve physical and mental health and well-being. 35 Evidence from laboratory animals and human studies suggests that physical activity and fitness improve mood and cognition by enhancing neural plasticity and growth factor expression in the brain at structural and molecular levels. Imaging studies of patients with AD suggest associations of fitness with a higher brain volume, including in the cortical regions of the lateral parietal cortex, and a lower risk of cognitive impairment. 36 Physical activity has also been shown to be associated with lower amyloid deposition. 37,38 Several small interventional studies of physical exercises demonstrated similar results. 39–41 These findings provide mechanistic plausibility to the association observed in our study. However, as in any observational study, bias and confounding may also contribute, at least in part, to the observed associations. Specifically, the lower ADRD risk observed in our study may be mediated by healthy lifestyle practices and other health benefits associated with fitness. Alternatively, it is also possible that fitness-associated longevity would attenuate ADRD benefit of fitness as age is the biggest risk factor for ADRD.42

Several prior studies have examined the association of physical activity and CRF with incident ADRD. 25,26 The largest of those studies is based on 19,458 middle-aged men and women, of whom 1,659 developed incident ADRD. 25 In that study, ADRD was diagnosed based on Medicare data, and participants had an average of 7 years of follow-up in the Medicare data. However, 95% of the participants in that study had their baseline examination more than 9 years before Medicare entry. Thus, it precluded the identification of incident ADRD during the decade of follow-up and exclusion of baseline ADRD. 25 Another study of 191 women aged 38–60 years followed for 44 years demonstrated a lower risk of ADRD associated with higher CRF. 26 In contrast, our study is based on the largest cohort of an ADRD-free population with data on CRF and the longest follow-up to date.

The findings of our study have important clinical and public health implications. The findings of the current study provide evidence to add ADRD risk reduction to the list of health benefits of CRF. Notably, a significantly lower ADRD risk was observed at approximately 6 METs and a progressively lower risk with higher MET levels. A measure of six METs represents peak exercise capacity achievable by most middle-aged and older individuals by engaging in brisk walking 3 to 5 times a week for approximately 30–40 minutes per session. 43 This is of significant public health relevance as this level of CRF is easily attainable by most middle-aged and older individuals. 19,20,23,24

Several limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. Veterans may not be representative of the general population. We have a low percentage of females. Nonetheless, our absolute number of women is substantial, and our racial representation is similar to that of the general population. The prevalence of depression is higher in our cohort than in the general population or a general older Veteran cohort. 32,44 Our prior study suggests in Veterans that depression is a risk factor for ADRD. (HR=1.65, 95% CI:1.65–1.68, p&lt;0.0001)32 In this study, we found a similar HR of 1.55 (95% CI:1.52–1.59, p&lt;0.0001). We adjusted for depression as a covariate (Table 1) in our analysis and checked for interaction between METs and depression, which was not significant. We recognize that tobacco and alcohol use can impact fitness. However, we could not reliably quantify tobacco and alcohol use and therefore we did not adjust for them. Our cohort was a clinical population. We, therefore, lack biomarker data which are typically not obtained outside of dedicated research settings. Neuropathological studies find a multitude of cerebral pathologies with increasing age. Our results therefore may be diluted about any single etiology of dementia. Despite our use of multivariable risk adjustment and propensity score matching, bias due to both measured and unmeasured confounders is possible. ADRD was diagnosed using ICD codes alone, which may underestimate true prevalence and incidence. However, it would be expected to affect all five fitness categories and is unlikely to bias the observed association. We are currently employing a weakly-supervised machine-learning approach developed by us to identify additional cases of ADRD using structured and unstructured data. 45 ETT is not a routine check-up procedure. According to the literature, “67% of the patients were referred for chest pain, 12% for shortness of breath, 4% for palpitations, 3% for pre-operative evaluation, 6% for abnormal prior testing, and 7% for risk factors only.”46,47 To avoid including patients with overt cardiovascular diseases, we excluded patients with coronary revascularization within 3 months after ETT, myocardial infarction and/or heart failure diagnosis 1 month prior and 3 months after ETT, and pacemaker use. Finally, while we recognize that improved CRF is an outcome of increased aerobically oriented physical activities, high CRF is also determined at least in part by genetic factors. 48,49 The independent or synergistic contribution of physical activity levels and genetic factors on CRF is beyond the scope of this study. Future precision medicine studies using biomarkers, genomics, and artificial intelligence may identify individual-specific recommendations for physical exercise necessary to achieve optimal CRF for maximal health benefits including ADRD risk reduction. An advantage of such an approach is that modest incremental changes can quantify risk reduction benefits and result in positive reinforcement of progressive CRF goals at the individual level.

The current study’s findings demonstrate an independent, inverse, and graded association between CRF and the incidence of ADRD regardless of gender or race. These findings along with the well-documented health benefits associated with increased CRF support the concept that improving CRF may be a potential and viable strategy to lower the risk of incident ADRD. Future studies need to determine strategies to improve fitness and identify individual optimal fitness goals for maximal ADRD risk reduction. A viable strategy will be to recommend adherence to the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans Field 43 as a means for improving CRF.
