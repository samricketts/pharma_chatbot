Oxidative stress is important for the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Research tools that can conveniently evaluate oxidative stress in AD models are expected to catalyze and accelerate research on AD. This study explored the use of genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFIs) to detect mitochondrial oxidative stress in organotypic brain slices and AD mouse models. To enable ratiometric normalization and avoid tissue autofluorescence, we genetically fused a green fluorescent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) indicator, HyPer7, with each of two selected, bright red fluorescent proteins (RFPs), mScarlet-I and tdTomato. The resultant indicators, namely HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT, were tagged with mitochondrial targeting sequences and examined for localization and function in cultured HeLa cells and primary mouse neurons. We further utilized HyPerGRT, which is a genetic fusion of HyPer7 with tdTomato, to monitor mitochondrial H2O2 in response to human β-amyloid 1–42 isoform (Aβ42) in cultured brain slices and an AD mouse model. Owning to the high sensitivity and low autofluorescence interference resulting from HyPerGRT, we successfully detected Aβ42-mediated mitochondrial H2O2 in these AD models. The results suggest that HyPerGRT is a valuable tool for studying mitochondrial oxidative stress in tissues and animals.

pmcAlzheimer’s disease (AD) and other age-related neurodegenerative disorders have become a global health and social challenge. Unfortunately, the exact cause of AD is still under investigation. Among various AD hypotheses, oxidative stress is considered either a causative factor or a critical cofactor in cascades of events leading to neuron death.1–4 In this context, there is a great interest in monitoring oxidative stress in various AD research models.

Synthetic fluorescent indicators can be used to image oxidative stress but often with limited specificity.5 Also, oxidative stress in AD is a chronic process, but it is challenging, if not impossible, to retain synthetic indicators in cells and tissues for extended periods. Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators (GEFIs) complement synthetic indicators and have been widely used to visualize biochemical dynamics in live cells, tissues, and animals.6–8 GEFIs can be genetically delivered and targeted to specific cell types or subcellular domains using cell-type-specific promotors and organelle-targeting sequences. The integration of GEFIs with viral vectors and transgenic techniques (e.g., Cre-Lox recombination) further increases the attractiveness of GEFIs.9

Intensiometric GEFIs have been widely used due to their large dynamic range and simplicity for operation.10 Meanwhile, intensiometric GEFIs face issues such as motions and migrations of imaging targets caused by the life activity of living organisms. Moreover, it is a challenge to gain stable baselines during chronic imaging of intensiometric GEFIs since the expression levels of GEFIs may change over time. In theory, any intensiometric GEFI can be converted into a ratiometric GEFI by creating a genetic fusion with a spectrally separated, constitutive fluorescent protein so that the ratios of fluorescence responses can be used for normalization.11,12

Only a very few studies have used GEFIs to image redox activities in brain tissues, and even fewer studies were related to AD models.13 In one example, roGFP1,14 a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein, was used to detect mitochondrial oxidative stress in the APP/PS1 transgenic AD mouse model.15 The areas with extensive oxidative stress were colocalized with amyloid plaques.16 These results align well with the hypothesis that the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) can lead to oxidative stress and cause neurotoxicity in the initiation and progression of AD.17–20 In another study, a roGFP2-based indicator, Grx-roGFP2,21 successfully detected the shift of the glutathione redox potential induced by Aβ42 in Drosophila models.22 However, the researchers did not observe any detectable change of roGFP2-Orp1,23 a GEFI for H2O2, under the same condition, so it was concluded that the glutathione redox potential changes, but not H2O2 level changes, are associated with Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity in vivo.22

H2O2 is a common reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a significant contributor to cellular oxidative stress.24 Mitochondria are major sites for H2O2 production.25 Previous studies have developed several GEFIs for monitoring cellular H2O2.26,27 Recently, HyPer7, a green fluorescent indicator for H2O2, was reported.28 HyPer7 is more sensitive to low amounts of H2O2 than previous GEFIs.28 We reasoned that HyPer7 could be localized to mitochondria and used to revisit the connection between H2O2 and Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity. HyPer7 itself has two excitation peaks. Its fluorescence intensities under ~ 500 nm and ~ 400 nm excitation can be used to deduce ratiometric responses.28 However, the 400-nm excitation-induced fluorescence is weak and overlaps with the strong autofluorescence of mammalian tissues.29,30 Moreover, it is a concern that 400-nm excitation may cause unwanted cellular autooxidation.31

To address the need to monitor slow H2O2 production processes in brain tissues, we genetically fused HyPer7 with each of two high-quality red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) for ratiometric normalization. We first evaluated the resultant mutants, HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT, in the mitochondria of human cervical cancer HeLa cells and primary mouse neurons. We next used HyPerGRT to monitor Aβ42-induced mitochondrial H2O2 in cultured organotypic brain slices and acute brain slices prepared from an Aβ42-induced AD mouse model. Our results suggest that mitochondrial H2O2 is elevated during Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity, and that HyPerGRT is a valuable tool for monitoring mitochondrial oxidative stress in animal tissues.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Plasmid construction.

Mitochondrial expression plasmids for HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT were constructed from pCS2+MLS-HyPer7, a gift from Vsevolod Belousov (Addgene plasmid # 136470).28 Briefly, a PCR reaction was used to remove the C-terminal stop codon of the Mito-HyPer7 gene, and the PCR product was digested and ligated into the pre-digested pCS2+ vector between BamH I and Xho I restriction sites. The ligation product was used to transform DH10B electrocompetent cells. The plasmid was recovered and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Next, PCR reactions were used to append a flexible linker (GGSGGGGSGG) at the N-terminus of the mScarlet-I32 or tdTomato33 gene. The products were digested and ligated into the above plasmid between Xho I and Xba I restriction sites. Again, the ligation products were used to transform DH10B electrocompetent cells. The plasmids (pMito-HyPerGRS and pMito-HyPerGRT) were recovered and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. To create the adeno-associated virus (AAV) transfer plasmids, the whole open reading frames were amplified from pMito-HyPerGRS or pMito-HyPerGRT and inserted to a pAAV-hSyn plasmid between Bam HI and Hind III restriction sites. Following the previous result,28 a C121S mutation was introduced into the HyPer7 gene fragment in pAAV-hSyn-Mito-HyPerGRT, resulting in an H2O2-insensitive control mutant.

HeLa cell culture, transfection, and imaging.

HeLa cells (ATCC #CCL-2) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, high glucose; Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2. Cells were placed in 35 mm glass-bottom cell culture dishes and transfected according to a previously described protocol.34 Cell culture media were replaced with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) at 24 h post-transfection. Cells were imaged on an inverted Leica DMi8 microscope equipped with a Leica EL6000 metal halide light source, a Photometrics Prime 95B scientific CMOS camera, and a 40× (NA 1.15) oil immersion objective lens. HeLa cells were treated with 100 μM H2O2 to examine the functions of mitochondrial HyPerGRM and HyPerGRT. The green and red channels were imaged sequentially using a FITC filter cube (470/40 nm excitation and 525/50 nm emission) and a TRITC filter cube (545/25 nm excitation and 605/70 nm emission) with excitation light intensity set at 55% and 30%, respectively. A digital optical power meter (Thorlabs, #PM100D) equipped with a microscope slide photodiode power sensor (Thorlabs, #S170C) was further used to determine light intensity at the focal plane. The illumination area was calculated from the field number (FN) provided by the objective lens manufacturer using π•(0.5•(FN/Objective Magnification))2. Light intensity was then calculated from the total energy divided by the illumination area. The light intensities at the focal plane for the green and red channels were ~ 4.6 and 5.3 W/cm2, respectively.

AAV packing and purification.

pAdDeltaF6 (Addgene plasmid catalog no. 112867) and pAAV2/9n (Addgene plasmid catalog no. 112865) were gifts from James M. Wilson and used as our packing plasmids. We followed a published protocol to pack and purify AAVs.35 The viral titers were determined using a qPCR method provided by Addgene. The titers of AAVs used in this study were ~2×1012 genome counts (GC)/mL.

Mouse primary neuron isolation, culture, transduction, and imaging.

Mouse primary neurons were isolated and cultured as previously described.36 Briefly, 35 mm glass-bottom cell culture dishes were pre-treated with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, Catalog no. SLBW6173) and rinsed with DPBS four times. Brain tissues were isolated from E18 mouse embryos and digested with 5 mL of 0.15% trypsin solution at 37°C for 15 min. Centrifugation was used to remove trypsin. Next, 5 mL DMEM (high glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin was added to resuspend the tissue, which was further disrupted by repetitive pipetting with a 1 mL pipettor. Each cell suspension was filtered through a 40 μm sterile cell strainer (Fisher Scientific, Catalog no. 22363547) and used to seed glass-bottom cell culture dishes. Cells were cultured in a 37°C incubator containing 5% CO2. 12 h later, the culture media were replaced with NbActive4 (BrainBits). Next, half of the media were replaced with fresh NbActive4 every 3 days. At day 5 post neuron isolation, 1 μL of the prepared AAV stock solutions were added to each 35 mm cell culture dish. Neurons were imaged at day 9 or day 10 post neuron isolation using a procedure similar to that described above for HeLa, except that the excitation light intensities were set at 45% and 25%, respectively. In addition, an inverted Leica DMi8 microscope equipped with a 488-nm diode laser, an SPE-II confocal module, and a 100× (NA 1.25) oil immersion objective lens was used to further examine the mitochondrial morphology of mouse neurons expressing the indicators. Fluorescence images of the green channel (500–550 nm emission) were acquired and processed using Fiji (ImageJ) following a protocol by Merrill et al.37 Briefly, the images were subtracted for background and converted into a binary image via threshold to retain only mitochondrial morphology. The resultant images were skeletonized and subjected to “particle analysis”. Mitochondrial perimeters were used as the parameter for comparison.

Animals and stereotaxic injection of AAVs.

All animal procedures and protocols were approved by the Animals Care and Use Committee (ACUC) at the University of Virginia. Female and male Balb/cJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock no. 000651) at 8–10 weeks old were used in this study. To perform the intracranial injection, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and mounted on a Stoelting stereotaxic frame. Then, 500 nL of the virus was injected to both sides of the hippocampus (from bregma: AP, −1.7 mm; ML, ±1.2 mm; DV, +1.5 mm)38 at a 100 nL/min flow rate. Mice were allowed to recover and express the indicators for ~ 3 weeks.

Organotypic brain slice culture and Aβ42 treatment.

Organotypic brain slices were prepared following a reported procedure.39 Mice were euthanized in a CO2 chamber at 3–4 weeks after viral injection. Brain tissue was recovered immediately and placed in the high-sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM) 73 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 24 dextrose, 0.5 CaCl2, and 75 sucrose, saturated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. The container was placed in a salt ice bath for 10 min. Next, the brain tissue was cut to 300 μm thick slices on a vibratome. All brain slices were placed in oxygenated ACSF in a 100-mm cultured dish and allowed to recover at 37°C for 15 min. Brain slices were further placed in Millicell cell culture inserts (Millipore, catalog no. PICM03050) and cultured in 6-well plated with 1 mL brain slice culture media in each well. The recipe of the brain slice culture media was identical to the reported.39 To treat the slices, human Aβ42 (GenScript, Catalog no. RP10017–0.5) was dissolved in DPBS to a final concentration of 1 mM and further diluted with the brain slice culture media to the desired concentrations. The negative control group was cultured in the brain slice culture media containing no Aβ42. Incubation lasted 48 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 before images were acquired on a Scientifica SliceScope Pro 1000 equipped with a Photometrics Prime 95B scientific CMOS camera and a CoolLED Enhanced pE-300white LED light source. Filters and excitation light intensities were similar to that described for HeLa. All images obtained with the same instrumental settings were used to calculate ratios of the green and red channels.

Stereotaxic intrahippocampal injection of Aβ42 and acute brain slice imaging.

Three weeks after intracranial viral injection, mice were anesthetized, and Aβ42 was administered to both sides of the hippocampus (from bregma: AP, −1.7 mm; ML, ±1.2 mm; DV, +1.5 mm).38 1 μL of 100 μM Aβ42 in DPBS was delivered at a flow rate of 100 nL/min to each mouse (500 nL for each side of the hippocampus). DPBS without Aβ42 was delivered into mice in the control group. Five days after the Aβ42 injection, mice were euthanized for harvesting brain tissues. Acute brain slices with 300 μm thickness were prepared in oxygenated ACSF. The preparation process was completed in ~15 min, and slices were imaged immediately using the above-described Scientifica SliceScope.

Data analysis.

Microsoft Excel, Graphpad 8.0.1, and Affinity Designer 1.9.2 were used to analyze data and prepare figures. Fiji (ImageJ) was used to analyze the images of the microscope. All microscopic images were subtracted background. Data are shown as mean and s.d. or s.e.m. as described in figure legends.

RESULTS

HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT in HeLa cells

mScarlet-I is a recently reported RFP with high quantum yield and fast maturation.32 tdTomato is exceptionally bright and has been widely used in neurons.33 We created genetic fusions of HyPer7 with either mScarlet-I or tdTomato. We modified the mitochondrial expression plasmid for HyPer7 by appending mScarlet-I or tdTomato to the C-terminus through a Gly-Ser-rich flexible linker (Figure 1a). Two copies of a mitochondrial targeting sequence derived from cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8 (COX8) were retained at the N-terminus for mitochondrial localization in mammalian cells. We named the resultant two plasmids pMito-HyPerGRS and pMito-HyPerGRT. HeLa cells transfected with each of the two plasmids were imaged sequentially for green and red fluorescence using ~470 and 545 nm excitation, respectively. Excellent mitochondrial localization was observed (Figure 1b). We next examined the responses of the two constructs in HeLa cells to the extracellular addition of 100 μM H2O2. For both constructs, the green fluorescence increased by ~100% (ΔF/F0) while the red fluorescence was almost unchanged, resulting in a 100% (ΔR/R0) ratiometric change by quantifying the green to red fluorescence ratio (Figure 1cd).

HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT in primary neurons

We prepared viral vectors for mitochondrial expression of HyPerGRS or HyPerGRT driven by the human synapsin I (hSyn) promoter. Both indicators were successfully expressed in cultured primary mouse neurons transduced with the viruses (Figure 2a). We next imaged the transduced neurons using a confocal microscope equipped with a high magnification (100×) objective and mitochondrial localization was obvious (Figure 2c).We further added 100 μM exogenous H2O2 to stimulate the neurons. Both HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT displayed a 30% fluorescence increase of the green to red fluorescence ratio (Figure 2b). Thus, the two constructs behaved similarly in our tests with HeLa cells and primary neurons. Because tdTomato was reported to be more photostable than mScarlet-I,32,40 we selected HyPerGRT for further studies.

Detection of Aβ42-induced H2O2 in organotypic brain slices

We stereotactically injected Mito-HyPerGRT AAV to both sides of the hippocampus of living mice. Brain slices were prepared three weeks later, showing robust green and red fluorescence in the hippocampus (Figure 3a). Furthermore, the addition of 100 μM H2O2 caused a 35% fluorescence increase of the green to red fluorescence ratio (Figure 3b), confirming that HyPerGRT is still functional and responsive to H2O2 in the mouse brain.

We next cultured the brain slices in vitro and treated them with various concentrations of Aβ42 (Figure 3c). We imaged the slices after 48 h incubation with Aβ42. The treatment with 5 μM Aβ42 slightly increased the green to red fluorescence ratio, but the difference was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, 50 μM and 100 μM Aβ42 co-culture led to a substantial increase in the fluorescence ratio from the untreated control (Figure 3d). In general, the response of the fluorescence ratio was dependent on the dose of Aβ42. We further used 100 μM Aβ42 to treat brain slices expressing an H2O2-insensitive C121S mutant and observed no significant difference in the fluorescence ratio, compared to the untreated control. In addition, we treated freshly prepared brain slices with 100 μM Aβ42 and performed time-lapse imaging on a microscope stage for a short period when the slices were kept alive. The Aβ42 addition did not immediately change the fluorescence of the indicators (Supporting Information, Figure S1). These results support that Aβ42 triggers mitochondrial H2O2 production in cultured organotypic brain slices.

Detection of H2O2 in acute brain slices from an Aβ42-induced mouse model

After observing Aβ42-triggered H2O2 in organotypic brain slices, we further investigated whether there is such phenomenon in vivo. We again delivered the Mito-HyPerGRT indicator and the C121S mutant to the hippocampus of live mice using the AAV vectors. Three weeks after the viral administration, we injected a small amount of Aβ42 to the same site to establish an in vivo Aβ42-induced mouse model,41 which is known for behavioral deficits,42 inflammation,43 and oxidative stress44 in animals. We prepared acute brain slices five days after the intrahippocampal injection of Aβ42 and imaged the slices immediately (Figure 4a). We selected 30 clear and bright neurons from five brain slices for each group and calculated their green to red fluorescence ratios. The green fluorescence intensity of brain slices from Aβ42-treated Mito-HyPerGRT mice was higher than the sham group, while the red fluorescence did not display a significant difference (Figure 4b). A 43% increase in the fluorescence ratio was observed (Figure 4c). Furthermore, the Aβ42 treatment did not change the fluorescence ratios of brain slices from the C121S mutant mice. The data suggest that Aβ42 increases mitochondrial H2O2 production in the brains of live mice

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

This study developed two ratiometric GEFIs for H2O2 by genetically fusing HyPer7 with either mScarlet-I or tdTomato. Because many green fluorescent intensiometric GEFIs are now available, we expect that similar ratiometric conversions can be performed with these other GEFIs to allow normalization. Thus, our results may be valuable and guide these conversions.

The fusion constructs, namely HyPerGRS and HyPerGRT, were first characterized for imaging mitochondrial H2O2 in HeLa cells and cultured primary mouse neurons. In these experiments, H2O2 was added extracellularly. Previous studies have shown a several-hundred-fold decrease of H2O2 concentrations across the plasma membrane.45,46 In addition, we can assume another H2O2 concentration gradient across the mitochondrial envelope. Such concentration gradients are likely different in different cell types. Furthermore, different cells have varied antioxidant capabilities. Thus, it made sense that the responses of the indicators were different in different cell types. In our experiments, 100 μM extracellular H2O2 did not saturate the responses of the indicators and the antioxidant capability of neurons. This observation corroborates the previous discovery that cultured mature neurons were resistant to acute H2O2 treatment.47.

The importance of mitochondria for neuronal functions is evident by a large number of neurodegenerative diseases that are linked to disrupted mitochondria.48 Previous studies reported that Aβ42 could disrupt mitochondrial function, induce oxidative stress, and cause neurotoxicity,49 but it has been controversial whether H2O2 contributes to Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity.22 In this study, we successfully used HyPerGRT to detect Aβ42-induced mitochondrial H2O2 increase using both in vitro and in vivo models. The mouse models used here may respond to Aβ42 differently from the Drosophila models used previously.22 More likely, our indicator is more sensitive to a small amount of H2O2. First, HyPerGRT was localized to mitochondria, the primary source of ROS production. Second, the HyPer7 component in HyPerGRT is more sensitive than other H2O2 indicators. Moreover, tdTomato was used for normalization, resulting in less interference from the fluorescence backgrounds of tissues.

It is, however, challenging to use the indicators to quantitatively determine mitochondrial H2O2 concentrations in Aβ42-treated brain slices. First, any attempt for calibrations with the exogenous addition of H2O2 will have to deal with the unknown factors related to the concentration gradients caused by the organization of the tissue and membrane structures in individual cells. Moreover, the fluorescence response is sensitive to indicator concentrations, as shown previously.28 Furthermore, the factors affecting the reversibility of the sensor response are likely different between in situ and in vitro. Despite these challenges, it is reasonable to assume that nanomolar H2O2 was generated in Aβ42-treated brain slices because the purified HyPer7 protein was sensitively responsive to nanomolar H2O2 in vitro.28 In addition, we can compare the response magnitude of the indicator in brain slices with the changes in cell cultures induced with 100 μM extracellular H2O2, a condition also expected to generate nanomolar mitochondrial H2O2. 28,45,46

Relatively high concentrations of Aβ42 were used in our organotypic slice experiments, but the incubation time was short (only two days). Our experiment condition is close to that used previously.50 On the one hand, we added Aβ42 to the culture media (not directly to the slices), and the efficiency for Aβ42 oligomers and aggregates to penetrate brain tissues might be limited. On the other hand, we expect lower amounts of Aβ42 with longer incubation time may cause similar or even higher changes. Of note, the quantity of Aβ42 used in our in vivo mouse model (~450 ng/mouse) is comparable to or lower than many other studies in the field.51,52 Our future studies will apply HyPerGRT to other AD mouse models (e.g., 5xFAD or J20 mice) that can spontaneously accumulate Aβ deposits. These additional mouse models do not rely on exogenously administered Aβ, thus providing more information on the link between H2O2 and Aβ.

In this study, we performed end-point measurements with acute brain slices at day 5 post Aβ42 transcranial administration. We plan in future studies to explore time-lapse changes during extended periods and compare redox changes with disease progression. This could be done by harvesting brain tissues at different time points, or more elegantly, by imaging live mice through cranial windows with implanted light fibers or lenses.53

In summary, this study establishes the feasibility of using HyPerGRT to study oxidative stress in mammalian tissues and animals. HyPerGRT will be a useful research tool for understanding the mechanisms of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
