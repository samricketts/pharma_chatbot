Introduction:

Nearly a dozen monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against beta-amyloid (Aβ) have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD), and most of these mAbs are undergoing clinical trials. Newer mAbs have targeted more specific Aβ types. Lecanemab Eisai has a high affinity for large and soluble Aβ protofibrils. Data from phase II clinical trials have suggested the possibility of a robust efficacy signal and manageable risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). Lecanemab is currently being studied in phase III trials.

Areas covered:

This article briefly reviews mAbs that target Aβ in AD and discusses the biology, mechanism of action, and targets of lecanemab.

Expert opinion:

mAbs that target Aβ are an important focus of therapeutic development for AD, with several soon to be considered for US Food and Drug Administration approval. The experience of aducanumab informs the development of other mAbs, such as lecanemab. One consideration is the conformation of Aβ targets. Targeting monomeric species has not resulted in robust clinical efficacy, whereas targeting Aβ in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, and plaques has shown evidence of slowing clinical decline. Another consideration is that mAbs will require safety monitoring for ARIAs.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common cause of dementia worldwide [1] and the most common age-related disease [2]. Given the aging population and expectation of greater life expectancy, AD is an increasingly significant public health problem, with an incidence that is predicted to increase by 3-fold over the next 50 years [2]. The management of AD patients is challenging because of the current lack of widely available disease-modifying pharmacotherapy [3] and no curative treatment [4]. AD is characterized pathophysiologically by the accumulation of extracellular senile plaques, which are composed of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles [2,5,6]. Studies strongly suggest that the abnormal accumulation of Aβ peptides in the brain, when present in high concentrations, is the pathogenic trigger of secondary events that result in progressive cognitive impairment [5]. Thus, Aβ peptides have emerged as a potential target of disease-modifying therapies [5].

Until recently, Aβ42 was considered as one of the principal pathogenic drivers of clinical AD. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that there was accelerated accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with specific autosomal dominant mutations of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and of presenilin 1 and 2. In these autosomal dominant mutations, and in trisomy 21 (the APP gene is located on chromosome 21), Aβ, and particularly Aβ42, is frequently overexpressed and detectable at a young age. Persons who carry these mutations start displaying symptomatic cognitive decline by the fourth or fifth decade of life, with increased Aβ loads detectable as early as the third decade in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain [7]. The amyloid cascade hypothesis [8] states that overproduction of Aβ is an early event in AD pathogenesis that then drives downstream pathologies, including tau neurofibrillary tangles, central inflammation, excitotoxicity, neurochemical changes, and neuronal death [9].

Aβ is a 38-43 residue polypeptide that is proteolytically excised from APP via the successive action of beta- and gamma-secretases; it is composed of a largely hydrophilic N-terminal domain and a hydrophobic C-terminal domain [2]. The predominant Aβ types comprise 40 (Aβ40) and 42 (Aβ42) residues, with the latter suggested to be considerably more neurotoxic and demonstrating a higher propensity for aggregation due to the addition of 2 hydrophobic amino acids [2]. In the oligomerization process, Aβ undergoes a series of conformational changes, progressing from monomers to oligomers, protofibrils, and mature amyloid fibrils, which ultimately form amyloid plaques [4]. Formation of oligomerized amyloid species is associated with cellular dysfunction leading to dementia [4]; however, the neurotoxicity and relevance of each conformational form to AD pathology is not clearly understood [2].

2. Early immunotherapy agents

Treating AD by removing amyloid has been proposed for more than 2 decades. Starting with the first active Aβ immunotherapy, AN1792, removal of Aβ from the brain has been demonstrable [10]. AN1792 moved into phase 2 clinical trials in 2001, and 360 participants were enrolled; but this study was discontinued early in 2002 because of 18 reported cases of encephalitis and 5 deaths. Autopsy results confirmed a partial removal of Aβ plaques [11]. Safety concerns have prompted research to shift from active immunization to passive immunization, mainly by means of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

The first generation of anti-Aβ mAbs that were developed as part of the passive immunization approach included bapineuzumab, solanezumab, and crenezumab. Solanezumab and crenezumab primarily targeted and bound the monomeric species of Aβ42 [12], whereas bapineuzumab primarily recognized senile plaques [13]. This mechanistic difference is often mentioned in discussions of what species of Aβ should be targeted. Monomeric Aβ is understood to be involved in the physiological process, with an unknown role in AD pathogenesis [2]. However, Aβ monomers have also been shown to increase the activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) [2], a key rate-limiting enzyme in Aβ production [14], and the main β-secretase in the brain [15]. Aβ plaques reduce cell membrane fluidity and integrity and result in neuronal death [6]. Theoretically, early inhibition of the Aβ oligomerization process at a monomeric Aβ target or downstream removal of the neurotoxic Aβ plaque end-product should reduce the overall levels of Aβ and result in a corresponding clinical improvement in AD. However, the first-generation mAbs showed either evidence of Aβ removal [16] or modest clinical efficacy [17], but not both concurrently.

In the early 2000s, studies on passive immunization of APP transgenic mice showed improvements in learning and memory, despite little to no effect on the Aβ burden [5]. This finding suggested that soluble Aβ species, rather than amyloid plaques, induce neuronal dysfunction in AD [5]. Thus, the focus of AD research has shifted from insoluble amyloid plaques to soluble Aβ species [5]. Subsequent studies have found that soluble Aβ species—oligomers and protofibrils (large oligomers)—better reflect the severity of dementia in AD patients [5]. Thus, immunotherapy with antibodies that neutralize the toxicity of soluble oligomeric Aβ species have been suggested as a promising therapeutic target for AD [18].

The second generation of anti-Aβ mAbs includes aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab, which are all administered by intravenous infusion, and gantenerumab, which is administered by subcutaneous injection [19,20]. The shared feature of 3 of these 4 late-stage anti-Aβ agents (aducanumab, lecanemab, and gantenerumab) is their interaction with neurotoxic soluble Aβ species, based on published pharmacodynamic studies [19]; these 3 antibodies showed increased selectivity for soluble Aβ oligomers versus insoluble fibrils or plaques [19]. Donanemab, on the other hand, demonstrates selective binding to an Aβ epitope present in insoluble plaques, without interaction with soluble Aβ species [20].

The key factor that, together with pharmacokinetic properties, appears to determine the clinical profile of each agent is the degree of Aβ oligomer selectivity [19]. Aducanumab and gantenerumab primarily target insoluble amyloid plaques, with partial oligomer selectivity [19]; donanemab selectively targets amyloid plaques, without oligomer selectivity [20]; and lecanemab is unique in its preferential target of soluble Aβ protofibrils (large oligomers) over plaques [19]. Somewhat related to this class, valiltramiprosate is an oral anti-amyloid agent with a similar target but a different mechanism; this small molecule prodrug is metabolized into tramiprosate (also known as homotaurine), which inhibits the formation and aggregation of soluble Aβ oligomers with no plaque interaction [19].

3. Lecanemab: design, binding affinity, and targets

Lecanemab (also called BAN2401) is a humanized version of the murine antibody mAb158. It is an immunoglobulin G1 mAb that preferentially targets soluble Aβ protofibrils, with activity at insoluble fibrils [5,18,21–25]. Lecanemab’s preferential target of Aβ protofibrils distinguishes it from the other anti-amyloid mAbs. Aβ protofibrils are large, soluble Aβ aggregates that exhibit neurotoxicity by impairing the electrophysiological mechanisms associated with memory function [5]. The formation of Aβ protofibrils is promoted by the Arctic APP mutation. The Arctic APP mutation has been found to lead to early-onset AD, which implicates Aβ protofibrils in AD pathogenesis [5]. In addition, intermediate-sized Aβ oligomers and protofibrils have been shown to be the most neurotoxic species [18], suggesting that targeting protofibrillar Aβ may be an effective treatment strategy. After the mechanistic processes of the Arctic APP mutation that leads to early AD onset were identified [26], lecanemab was designed to selectively target these large, soluble protofibrils (which are more than 1000-fold larger than Aβ monomers), while it also interacts with the insoluble fibrils that are a major component of brain amyloid plaques.

Of all second-generation mAbs, lecanemab is the most effective in the immunodepletion of Aβ protofibrils, especially soluble protofibrils and oligomers. Compared to aducanumab, lecanemab binds small protofibrils with 100 times greater affinity and large protofibrils with 25 times greater affinity, with lower binding affinity for monomers [27]. Aducanumab showed very weak binding to small oligomers, whereas gantenerumab showed significant binding to small oligomers. Compared to lecanemab and aducanumab, gantenerumab is less selective and binds monomers with greater affinity. Aducanumab and gantenerumab show the highest preference for insoluble Aβ fibrils; the second highest preference was for monomers, and the least affinity was for soluble Aβ species. Aducanumab had lower binding for all Aβ species [28]. Donanemab lacks affinity for any soluble forms of Aβ and selectively targets insoluble amyloid plaques [20].

4. Early development of lecanemab

A 2009 study by Lord et al. [5] explored the use of selective targeting of protofibrillar Aβ species using the highly protofibril-selective monoclonal antibody mAb158. That study found that mAb158 inhibited in vitro fibril formation and protected against Aβ protofibril-induced cellular toxicity. Subsequently, when mAb158 was administered to transgenic mice with both the Arctic and Swedish mutations (tg-ArcSwe) in which senile plaques had not yet appeared, Aβ deposition in the brain was prevented, and levels of Aβ protofibrils were diminished. These findings suggested that passive immunotherapy can selectively clear Aβ protofibrils in an animal model that displays highly insoluble Aβ deposits, similar to those of AD brain [5].

A 2015 study by Tucker et al. [21] showed that mAb158 and the humanized antibody BAN2401 that is derived from it have a strong binding preference for toxic soluble Aβ protofibrils over Aβ monomers. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that treatment of transgenic mice with mAb158 reduced levels of protofibrils in the brain and CSF [21].

5. Clinical trials investigating lecanemab

Lecanemab was evaluated in a large, 18-month phase 2 proof-of-concept, double-blind study, A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Lecanemab in Subjects With Early Alzheimer’s Disease (BAN2401-G000-201 Core Study; NCT01767311) [29], using Bayesian design with response adaptive randomization in 856 patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia) [29,30]. This clinical trial assessed 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo, aiming to determine the simplest dose that would achieve ≥90% of the maximum treatment effect, termed the effective dose 90% (ED90) [29]. This study also included an open-label extension phase. The primary endpoint was clinical change at 12 months on the Alzheimer’s Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, which required an 80% probability of a greater than 25% clinical reduction in decline versus placebo [29]. Secondary endpoints included a reduction of brain Aβ loads on PET; clinical decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating—Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), and AD Assessment Scale—Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog); changes in CSF core biomarkers (Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, phospho-tau); and changes in total hippocampal volume on volumetric magnetic resonance imaging [29].

In this phase 2 clinical trial, the 10 mg/kg biweekly dosage of lecanemab showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS at 12 months, therefore failing to meet the 80% threshold for the primary endpoint. At 18 months, the 10 mg/kg biweekly dosage showed 27% and 30% less decline on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% less decline on ADAS-Cog, and 33% and 26% less decline on CDR-SB compared to placebo according to Bayesian and frequentist analyses, respectively [29]. In addition, this dose of lecanemab significantly reduced brain amyloid burden on PET imaging (by a standardized uptake value ratio of −0.306). Although the threshold for the primary Bayesian analysis at 12 months was not met, results from prespecified 18-month frequentist analyses indicated that lecanemab treatment produced consistent dose-dependent reductions in clinical decline and brain amyloid burden in patients with early AD [29]. The study identified that a lecanemab dosage of 10 mg/kg administered intravenously biweekly, without titration, is the optimal dose to test in the phase 3 clinical trial for Aβ clearance, clinical efficacy, and safety. Currently, this dosage is being evaluated in the open-label extension phase of the phase 2 study, as well as in the phase 3 study, A Study to Confirm Safety and Efficacy of Lecanemab in Participants With Early Alzheimer’s Disease (Clarity AD) (NCT03887455) [29].

In the double-blind phase 2 core study, lecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) suggestive of parenchymal edema and infusion reactions being the most common adverse events observed in the core study [29]. ARIA related to edema was dose-dependent, with an incidence of less than 10% at the highest doses for the overall population and an incidence of 14.3% for apolipoprotein E4-positive subjects, with most edema occurring in the first 3 months of treatment and with a mild-to-moderate severity. No reported cases of ARIA due to hemosiderin deposition occurred [29]. Of note, although the risk of ARIA is a known effect of many anti-Aβ antibodies [20,29,31–34], the relatively lower risk of ARIA with lecanemab may be due to its pharmacological profile and lower binding to Aβ fibrils, compared to other anti-Aβ mAbs.

The phase III Clarity study confirmed the results of the phase II study and met its prespecified endpoints. A total of 1795 participants were randomized to receive lecanemab (898 participants) or placebo (897 participants). Lecanemab treatment met the primary endpoint, reducing decline on Clinical Dementia Rating—Sum of Boxes versus placebo at 18 months by 27% (change: −0.45; P&lt;0.001), with highly significant changes starting at 6 months. At 18 months, lecanemab reduced brain amyloid versus placebo (mean difference [95% CI], −70 [69-73] centiloids, P&lt;0.001), slowed loss of cognition by 26% on ADAS-Cog14, and slowed loss of function on the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Scale by 37%. All key secondary outcomes were significant in favoring lecanemab (all P&lt;0.001). Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated, with a low incidence of ARIA-E (edema/effusion) of 12.6% for the lecanemab cohort and 1.7% for the placebo cohort (symptomatic: 2.8% in the lecanemab cohort and 0.0% in the placebo cohort). The phase III Clarity study of lecanemab demonstrated a significant slowing of decline in clinical (global, cognitive, and functional) outcomes and reduction in brain amyloid in early AD [35].

6. Discussion

The past several decades have seen significant progress in AD drug development, and several mAbs have been produced that target different species of Aβ implicated in the pathogenesis of AD [19]. Recently, second-generation mAbs have shown promising clinical and biomarker effects in late-stage trials, as well as acceptable long-term safety [19]. If these second-generation mAbs prove to be clinical efficacious, they may be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing within the next 1 to 3 years, thus ushering in the first wave of disease-modifying therapy for AD [19]. Specifically, lecanemab shows promise for robust signals of efficacy and directional concordance between the reduction of Aβ loads and the slowing of cognitive decline. It also shows the potential for fewer ARIA because of the Aβ species targeted.

The lecanemab phase 2 core study demonstrated rapid and thorough Aβ clearance that correlated with clinical benefit in early symptomatic AD, whereas the ongoing AHEAD 3-45 study (NCT04468659) is evaluating outcomes of lecanemab therapy earlier in the AD continuum [36]. The AHEAD 3-45 trial is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-treatment arm, 216-week study that consists of 2 sister trials (the A3 trial and the A45 trial) to assess the efficacy and safety of lecanemab treatment in cognitively normal subjects with intermediate to elevated Aβ levels as determined by PET, CSF, or plasma testing. The phase 2 A3 trial will enroll approximately 400 subjects with intermediate brain amyloid loads (20-40 centiloids on PET), and it aims to determine whether lecanemab infusion is superior to placebo in preventing brain amyloid accumulation as seen on PET, with tau accumulation on PET as a secondary outcome. The phase 3 A45 trial will enroll approximately 1000 subjects with elevated Aβ loads (defined as &gt;40 centiloids) to determine whether lecanemab infusion is superior to placebo on change from baseline of the Preclinical Alzheimer Composite 5 scale. Ultimately, the AHEAD 3-45 trial will assess whether lecanemab therapy initiated during the early, asymptomatic stage of AD can prevent Aβ accumulation, downstream tau pathology, and cognitive decline. With a projected completion date of 2027, this prevention trial will provide useful information about lecanemab as a potential therapy for intervention before an individual experiences significant irreversible neurodegeneration, precluding the development of clinical AD [36].

Further studies are needed to better understand how lecanemab may be optimally utilized as a potential disease-modifying treatment for AD patients. Recently, a new subcutaneous formulation of lecanemab has been developed and is currently being tested in the open-label extension of the phase 3 Clarity AD trial [37]. In addition, a hexavalent antibody based on mAb158 is being developed to enhance binding strength selectivity to Aβ protofibrils [38]. While clinical trials for lecanemab therapy in AD are underway, preclinical research indicates the possible binding of lecanemab to Aβ deposits in Down syndrome as well [39].

7. Expert opinion

Protofibrils have been implicated in AD pathogenesis by discovery of the Arctic APP mutation. Protofibrils are large aggregates of soluble Aβ that exhibit neurotoxicity by impairing the electrophysiological mechanisms associated with memory function [5]. Lecanemab, which is an investigational humanized mAb that selectively targets Aβ protofibrils, has shown rapid and thorough Aβ clearance from the brain that correlates with clinical benefit [29]. Based on its demonstrated individual efficacy, lecanemab shows promising potential to provide a treatment for patients with AD.

In June 2021, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for aducanemab. However, use of aducanemab has been negligible since approval. On July 5, 2022, it was announced that the FDA accepted the Biologics License Application for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway and that lecanemab was granted priority review, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date of January 6, 2023. The readout of the primary endpoint data of the Clarity AD trial was expected in September 2022 and may serve as the confirmatory study to verify the clinical benefit of lecanemab [40].

Because it shows promise to benefit the vast community of patients currently living with AD, expeditious national coverage for lecanemab is strongly warranted. Medicare benefit is derived from clear evidence of lecanemab’s clinical benefit in ongoing randomized controlled trials, while registries can provide additional data. A delay in coverage could be detrimental to MCI and AD dementia patients who are waiting for an effective treatment.

The findings need to be considered contextually. Possible explanations for the difficulty of obtaining positive results include the poor correlation between amyloid load and cognitive decline, the clinical measure as a proxy measure of a biological effect, and the selection of the subspecies of Aβ. Lecanemab is actually the seventh mAB. The totality of evidence suggests that targeting monomeric Aβ does not result in a robust clinical effect. Thus, targeting oligomeric species, protofibrillar, fibrillar, or plaque seems to increase the likelihood of a biological effect.

In addition to the primary finding of Aβ clearance and the corresponding slowing of cognitive decline, secondary measures of efficacy in clinical trials, including time-to-event analysis, pharmaco-economic outcomes, and caregiver burden, are important factors to consider that may demonstrate lecanemab’s potential for clinical significance. For example, a delay in progression from mild-moderate AD to moderate-severe AD in the lecanemab treatment group compared to placebo would potentially extend the period during which AD patients are capable of taking care of themselves, thus reducing the total caregiver burden. The real effect of the positive results on the quality of life of AD patients would be delay of progression from MCI to mild AD dementia or delay from mild to moderate AD dementia. Estimates of delay indicate approximately 6 months of preservation at a given stage. That translates into 6 months more of independence, autonomy, agency, and retained quality of life without incremental loss. Given the increasing prevalence of AD and the high costs associated with long-term care, even a small delay in progression could have exponential effects on the nation’s economic burden of AD patient care. The future of AD treatment will be a multidrug cocktail that targets multiple aspects of AD pathology, much like chemotherapy for cancer. The possibility of a multifactorial approach that can combine lecanemab with other drugs to better address the complexity of AD pathogenesis is likely and planned. Consider that the Clarity trial included participants receiving standard of care (therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine). This indicates that a multifactorial approach is already making its way into trial design. Furthermore, lifestyle-directed approaches in MCI would be augmenting pharmacological treatments and would not constitute an either/or approach.

The results of the AHEAD 3-45 trial are expected to determine whether lecanemab therapy can slow Aβ and tau accumulation and prevent the cognitive decline associated with AD during its preclinical stage [36]. This trial is projected to end in 2027 and will provide useful information about lecanemab as a potential preventative therapy for AD. The recently developed subcutaneous administration of lecanemab may increase the accessibility and convenience of this therapy for patients and their caregivers in the future, allowing easier at-home administration.
