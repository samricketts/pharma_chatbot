Background and Purpose:

Left ventricular (LV) mass index is a marker of subclinical LV remodeling that relates to white matter damage in aging, but molecular pathways underlying this association are unknown. This study assessed if LV mass index related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of microglial activation (sTREM2), axonal injury (neurofilament light (NFL)), neurodegeneration (total tau), and amyloid-β, and whether these biomarkers partially accounted for associations between increased LV mass index and white matter damage. We hypothesized higher LV mass index would relate to greater CSF biomarker levels, and these pathologies would partially mediate associations with cerebral white matter microstructure.

Methods:

Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project participants who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance, lumbar puncture, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (n=142, 72±6 years, 37% mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 32% apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 positive, LV mass index 51.4±8.1 g/m2, NFL 1070±588 pg/mL) were included. Linear regressions and voxel-wise analyses related LV mass index to each biomarker and DTI metrics, respectively. Follow-up models assessed interactions with MCI and APOE-ε4. In models where LV mass index significantly related to a biomarker and white matter microstructure, we assessed if the biomarker mediated white matter associations.

Results:

Among all participants, LV mass index was unrelated to CSF biomarkers (p-values&gt;0.33). LV mass index interacted with MCI (p=0.01), such that higher LV mass index related to increased NFL among MCI participants. Associations were also present among APOE-ε4 carriers (p-values=0.02). NFL partially mediated up to 13% of the effect of increased LV mass index on white matter damage.

Conclusions:

Subclinical cardiovascular remodeling, measured as an increase in LV mass index, is associated with neuroaxonal degeneration among individuals with MCI and APOE-ε4. Neuroaxonal degeneration partially reflects associations between higher LV mass index and white matter damage. Findings highlight neuroaxonal degeneration, rather than amyloidosis or microglia, may be more relevant in pathways between structural cardiovascular remodeling and white matter damage.


pmc1. Introduction

Increased left ventricular (LV) mass index (LV mass/body surface area) is an imaging biomarker reflecting subclinical remodeling of the ventricular wall of the heart.1 Increased LV mass index is associated with cognitive decline,2 cerebral white matter macrostructure damage,3,4 and cerebral white matter microstructure damage,5 even in the absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).5 However, the mechanisms underlying associations between increased LV mass and cerebral white matter changes remain unknown. While it is possible that associations between LV mass index and white matter microstructure are due to shared underlying risk factors, such as differences in cellular organization, there are multiple pathways that could account for the associations between LV mass index and white matter damage.

Increased LV mass index is associated with cerebral small vessel disease,6,7 an increased risk of stroke,8 and hypertension.9 These pathologies contribute to a neuroinflammatory state,10 which leads to white matter damage in older adults.11 For example, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker of microglial activation, sTREM2 (soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2), is associated with white matter damage.12 Small vessel disease is also associated with axonal injury,13 which can be assessed by CSF NFL (neurofilament light),14 a protein comprising large caliber myelinated axons.14 Unsurprisingly, CSF NFL concentrations are also associated with white matter damage15,16 and dementia.17

In addition to cerebral small vessel disease, increased LV mass index has been associated with smaller grey matter volumes.4 Neurodegeneration can disrupt adjacent white matter via Wallerian degeneration18 and may be an additional pathway through which LV mass index affects cerebral white matter. Finally, it is possible Alzheimer’s disease pathology may partially account for associations between LV mass index and white matter microstructural damage as Aβ (amyloid-β), a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, has been associated with white matter damage.15,16 Thus, Aβ, microglial activation, axonal injury, or age-related neurodegeneration may each represent a pathway through which LV mass index affects cerebral white matter microstructure.

The current study first examines the association between LV mass index and CSF markers of Aβ aggregation, microglial activation (sTREM2), neuroaxonal injury (NFL), and age-related neurodegeneration (total-tau), and then assesses whether CSF biomarkers partially mediate our previously reported link between LV mass index and white matter microstructure among older adults.5 CSF Aβ,15 sTREM2,12 NFL,15 and total-tau,19 are each associated with white matter microstructural damage, so we hypothesized higher LV mass index would relate to greater CSF evidence of these same pathological processes. We also hypothesized these pathologies would partially mediate associations between LV mass index and white matter microstructure. We tested whether cognitive diagnosis (cognitively unimpaired (CU) versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) or apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carrier status, a modifier of vascular health,20 modified these associations, as associations between higher LV mass index and white matter microstructural damage are most prominent among individuals with MCI5 and APOE-ε4 independently damages white matter in aging adults.21

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Study Cohort

The Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project22 is a longitudinal observational study investigating the role subclinical vascular disease plays in accelerating abnormal brain aging in older adults prior to the onset of clinical dementia, utilizing neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and CSF outcomes. As part of a comprehensive screening, participants were required to be 60 years of age or older and excluded from the parent study for a cognitive diagnosis other than normal cognition, early MCI,23 or MCI,24 MRI contraindication, history of neurological disease, heart failure, major psychiatric illness, head injury with loss of consciousness &gt;5 minutes, or systemic or terminal illness affecting longitudinal participation. At enrollment, participants completed a comprehensive examination, including (but not limited to) fasting blood draw, physical examination, clinical interview, medication review, echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance, multi-modal brain magnetic resonance imaging, and optional lumbar puncture. While the parent study is longitudinal, the current study is cross-sectional and leverages data from the baseline visit. Participants were excluded from the current study for missing LV mass, covariate, or outcome data (Supplemental Figure I). See Supplemental Table I for a comparison of participants included and excluded from the present analyses. The protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from participants prior to data collection. Due to participant consent restrictions in data sharing, a subset of data is available to others for purposes of reproducing the results. These data, analytical methods, and study materials can be obtained by contacting the corresponding author.

2.2 Cardiac Magnetic Resonance

As previously published,5 cardiac magnetic resonance was acquired at Vanderbilt University Medical Center using a 1.5T Siemens Avanto system. LV and right ventricular volume and function were assessed using the following sequence parameters: repetition time=180ms, echo time=1.1ms, flip angle=80°, field of view=300–340mm, and 156×192 matrix. Trained analysts blinded to clinical information (JGT, SN) used QMass MR 7.6 Enterprise Solution to define LV endocardial and epicardial contours at end systole and end diastole. LV mass was calculated at end diastole by summing the myocardial area for each slice, multiplying by slice thickness plus slice gap, and multiplying by 1.05g/mL. LV mass index was defined as LV mass/body surface area.

2.3 Lumbar Puncture &amp; Biochemical Analysis

A subset of participants completed an optional fasting lumbar puncture at enrollment (Supplemental Figure I). CSF was collected with polypropylene syringes using a Sprotte 25-gauge spinal needle in a lumbar space. Samples were immediately mixed and centrifuged. Supernatants were aliquoted in 0.5 mL polypropylene tubes and stored at −80°C. Samples were analyzed in single batch using an in house immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection to determine the levels of sTREM2.25 Commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to measure NFL (UmanDiagnostics), total-tau (INNOTEST hTAU) and Aβ (INNOTEST β-AMYLOID(1–42)). Board-certified laboratory technicians processed data blinded to clinical information. Intra-assay coefficients of variation were &lt;10%.25

2.4 Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Participants were scanned at the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science on a 3T Philips Achieva (Best, The Netherlands) using an 8-channel sensitivity encoding reception coil array. Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired along 32 diffusion gradient vectors (repetition time/echo time=10000/60ms, spatial resolution=2×2×2mm3, b-value=1000s/mm2) and post-processed through an established tract-based spatial statistics pipeline using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library version 5.0.6 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL).26

The diffusion tensor model was fit using CAMINO’s RESTORE, and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity were calculated. All FA images were non-linearly registered, merged into a 4D image, and a mean image was created. The mean image was used to generate a mean skeleton to which a threshold was applied excluding voxels that did not overlap among ≥80% of participants. For each metric, participant data were projected onto the original mean FA skeleton.

2.5 Analytical Plan

Covariates have been defined previously5 and were selected a priori for their potential to confound analyses (Supplemental Methods). Linear regressions defined the associations between LV mass index and CSF sTREM2, NFL, total-tau, and Aβ concentrations (pg/mL), adjusting for age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (excluding points assigned to age and LVH), cognitive diagnosis, and APOE-ε4 status (one outcome per model). To replicate our previously reported findings5 in this smaller sample, voxel-wise analyses using general linear models and FSL randomise with 5000 permutations defined the association between LV mass index (g/m2) and FA, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity, adjusting for identical covariates (one outcome per model). Excluding the small subset of participants with early MCI, all models were repeated evaluating an LV mass x MCI interaction term followed by stratification by MCI status (yes, no) to determine if associations were different between groups. Models were repeated evaluating an LV mass x APOE-ε4 interaction term followed by stratification by APOE-ε4 status (yes, no). To determine if hypertension was driving associations, LV mass x hypertension interactions were also tested. Multiple comparison correction was performed using a false discovery rate for non-voxel-wise models and cluster enhancement permutation27 for voxel-wise models. Sensitivity analyses, removing participants with LVH, prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), or atrial fibrillation, were performed to determine if associations were driven by participants with comorbid cardiovascular disease.

For models in which LV mass index was significantly related to CSF biomarkers and brain DTI metrics in clusters over 100 voxels, analyses tested whether the CSF biomarker mediated associations between LV mass index and cerebral white matter microstructure (Figure 1). To calculate the total effects, data from DTI clusters significantly related to LV mass index were extracted and the average value for each DTI metric in the cluster was calculated for every participant. The total effects were then calculated in linear models relating LV mass index to the average DTI metric value in every cluster, adjusting for identical covariates. The direct effects were calculated in linear models relating LV mass index to the average DTI metric value in every cluster, adjusting for identical covariates and the CSF biomarker. The mediation (indirect) effects were calculated as the total effect minus the direct effect, and the proportions mediated were calculated as the mediation effect divided by the total effect. The proportion mediated was interpreted as the percent of the outcome mediated by CSF NFL. For all models, the threshold for statistical significance was set a priori as corrected p-value&lt;0.05.Analyses were conducted in R version 3.5.2 (www.r-project.org).

3. Results

3.1. Participant Characteristics

The sample included 142 participants (72±6 years, 68% male, 92% non-Hispanic White). LV mass index ranged 32.6 to 69.3 g/m2. See Table 1 for characteristics.

3.2. LV Mass Index &amp; CSF Biomarkers

Among the entire sample, LV mass index was unrelated to all CSF biomarker concentrations (p-values&gt;0.33). LV mass index interacted with MCI on CSF NFL (p=0.01, Figure 2), such that higher LV mass index was associated with higher CSF NFL concentrations among MCI participants (β=27.1, p=0.04). However, among CU participants, higher LV mass index was counter-intuitively associated with lower CSF NFL concentrations (β=−14.8, p=0.05). LV mass index did not interact with MCI on any other CSF biomarker (p-values&gt;0.25), and analyses stratified by diagnosis were null (p-values&gt;0.24). LV mass index did not interact with APOE-ε4 on any CSF biomarker (p-values&gt;0.08), but stratified models revealed higher LV mass index was associated with higher CSF NFL concentrations only among APOE-ε4 carriers (β=25.4, p=0.02). All other analyses stratified by APOE-ε4 status were null (p-values&gt;0.20). LV mass index did not interact with hypertension on any CSF biomarker (p-values&gt;0.28, data not shown). When correcting for multiple comparisons, the LV mass index interaction with MCI on CSF NFL persisted (p=0.05). In sensitivity analyses excluding participants with prevalent CVD, atrial fibrillation, or LVH, the associations between LV mass index and CSF NFL in MCI (β=21.2, p=0.12) and CU participants (β=−13.8, p=0.07) were slightly attenuated. All other associations between LV mass index and CSF NFL remained below the a priori threshold of p=0.05. See Table 2 and Supplemental Table II for details.

To better understand the counterintuitive findings between LV mass index and CSF NFL in CU participants, several potential interactions were explored between LV mass index and age, sex, Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and diabetes. All models were null (p-values&gt;0.13).

3.3 LV Mass Index &amp; DTI Metrics

Consistent with our previously reported findings in the entire cohort,5 among all participants in this subsample with CSF data, higher LV mass index related to higher mean diffusivity (corrected p-values&lt;0.049), radial diffusivity (corrected p=0.018), and axial diffusivity (corrected p-values&lt;0.023), indicating greater white matter microstructural damage. Effects were strongest primarily in the anterior corona radiata and inferior frontal gyrus. When excluding participants with prevalent CVD, atrial fibrillation, or LVH, associations between LV mass index and axial diffusivity remained (corrected p-value=0.043). See Supplemental Table III for details, including effect sizes.

LV mass index did not interact with MCI on any DTI metric (corrected p-values&gt;0.40). In stratified results, LV mass index was not associated with any DTI metric among CU participants (corrected p-values&gt;0.22). However, among MCI participants, higher LV mass index was associated with higher mean diffusivity (corrected p-values&lt;0.05), radial diffusivity (corrected p-values&lt;0.049), and axial diffusivity (corrected p-values&lt;0.041), indicating greater white matter microstructural damage. Effects were strongest in the body of the corpus callosum, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. See Table 3 for details, including effect sizes. When excluding participant’s with prevalent CVD, atrial fibrillation, or LVH, results were attenuated (corrected p-values&gt;0.12), likely due to decreased power with a smaller sample size.

LV mass index did not interact with APOE-ε4 on any DTI metric (corrected p-values&gt;0.19). Among APOE-ε4 non-carriers, higher LV mass index related to higher axial diffusivity (corrected p=0.035), primarily in the inferior frontal gyrus. Among APOE-ε4 carriers, higher LV mass index was related to higher mean diffusivity (corrected p-values&lt;0.05) in the splenium of the corpus callosum and inferior frontal gyrus. When excluding participants with prevalent CVD, atrial fibrillation, or LVH, results were attenuated (corrected p-values&gt;0.07). See Supplemental Table IV for details, including effect sizes. LV mass index did not interact with hypertension on any DTI metric (corrected p-values&gt;0.38, data not shown).

3.4 Mediation Analysis

Based on the associations between LV mass index and CSF NFL above, CSF NFL was assessed as a mediator for the LV mass index and DTI associations separately among MCI participants and APOE-ε4 carriers in certain clusters. First, among MCI participants, CSF NFL partially mediated direct associations between LV mass index and mean, radial, and axial diffusivity. Specifically, CSF NFL reflected 6% of the effect of LV mass index on mean diffusivity in the corpus callosum, 13% of the effect of LV mass index on radial diffusivity in the anterior corona radiata, and 9% of the effect of LV mass index on axial diffusivity in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Among APOE-ε4 carriers, CSF NFL partially mediated direct associations between LV mass index and mean diffusivity, such that CSF NFL reflected 13% of the effect of LV mass index on mean diffusivity in the anterior corona radiata. See Table 4 for detailed mediation results.

4. Discussion

Among our community-dwelling cohort of older adults free of clinical stroke, higher LV mass index was associated with greater in vivo molecular evidence of neuroaxonal injury (NFL) among individuals with MCI and among APOE-ε4 carriers. However, among CU participants, higher LV mass index was counter-intuitively associated with less molecular evidence of neuroaxonal injury. Notably, all associations were independent of LVH, prevalent cardiovascular disease, or atrial fibrillation as evidenced by the effects persisting despite exclusion of participants with these conditions in sensitivity analyses. In mediation analyses, we discovered neuroaxonal injury partially mediates direct associations between increased LV mass index and cerebral white matter microstructural damage among individuals with MCI and among APOE-ε4 carriers.

This study is among the first to report an association between LV mass index and neuroaxonal injury, and the first to investigate neuroaxonal injury as a mediating pathway between subclinical cardiovascular remodeling and cerebral white matter injury. We found CSF NFL accounts for up to 13% of the association between LV mass index and white matter microstructural damage in MCI and APOE-ε4 carriers, suggesting neuroaxonal degeneration is one pathway by which increased LV mass detrimentally affects cerebral white matter health. These findings were most robust in large white matter tracts, such as the corona radiata and corpus callosum, known to be susceptible to vascular injury. As the left ventricle hypertrophies, the pumping efficiency of the myocardium decreases28 and cerebral blood delivery may become compromised.3 Resulting cerebral microvascular changes6,7 may lead to oligemia29 and neuroaxonal injury,13 detected as an increase in CSF NFL concentrations. Oligemia alters ion homeostasis,30 which disrupts neurofilaments31 and initiates axon compaction,32 resulting in white matter damage detected on DTI. This pathway is likely pronounced in individuals with MCI who have extensive pathology underlying their cognitive symptoms,33 which heightens cerebral vulnerability to subtle microvascular changes and neuroaxonal injury. APOE-ε4 is a is a modifier of vascular health20 and disrupts lipid transport, leading to myelination deficits and white matter compromise.21 Thus, the effects of subclinical cardiovascular remodeling on white matter microstructure via neuroaxonal degeneration may be exacerbated in APOE-ε4 carriers. It should be noted that LV mass index did not significantly interact with MCI or APOE-ε4 on white matter microstructure, so these findings must be interpreted with caution.

Importantly, these findings were seen in individuals without clinical stroke, heart failure, or LVH, and results were not driven by hypertension. Our results suggest subtle changes in cardiovascular health, even as early as mid-life prior to overt disease, may have the largest influence on brain health outcomes. Even in the absence of frank cerebral white matter disease and heart disease, a biomarker of neuroaxonal injury still accounts for 13% percent of white matter damage in certain regions due to increased LV mass index. To put this finding into context, small vessel disease accounts for up to 25% of ischemic strokes.34 While the white matter injury in specific tracts explained by CSF NFL is relatively small, our results suggest neuroaxonal injury is a significant contributor to pre-clinical white matter disease and should be studied further as a potential pathway through which early cardiovascular changes precipitate or exacerbate brain health outcomes.

While we found neuroaxonal degeneration partially accounts for direct associations between higher LV mass index and cerebral white matter microstructural damage, there are additional pathways that might account for our results. Notably, we did not detect any associations between LV mass index and biomarkers of microglial activation, neurodegeneration, or Aβ aggregation, suggesting LV mass index does not affect white matter through the biomarkers we have measured for these pathways. It is possible a shared upstream mechanism is driving the complex associations among LV mass index, CSF NFL, and white matter damage in individuals with MCI and APOE-ε4 carriers. For example, underlying cytoskeletal abnormalities could result in structural changes in both the myocardium (detected as an increase in LV mass on cardiac magnetic resonance) and cerebral white matter microstructural damage (seen on DTI). However, even if increased CSF NFL and white matter damage on DTI reflect the same upstream mechanism of damage, our results suggest CSF NFL is a sensitive marker of white matter damage in the setting of cardiovascular remodeling. Future studies are needed to explore additional pathways through which subclinical cardiovascular changes affects abnormal brain aging. The findings presented here must be interpreted with caution, as many results would not survive a strict FDR correction for multiple comparisons, and null results should be replicated.

Among CU individuals, we observed the opposite association, such that lower LV mass index related to higher concentrations of CSF NFL. One potential explanation for this counterintuitive finding is a selection bias. If CU participants have higher levels of NFL and are also susceptible to the effects of subclinical cardiovascular remodeling, one might expect a more severe clinical phenotype, such as MCI. Alternatively, lower LV mass in healthy individuals may indicate the heart is not pumping as often or with as much force. In that context, there may be reduced cerebral blood flow delivery that contributes to neuroaxonal degeneration.35 While this may not be likely given that the reductions in LV mass index seen here are not clinically significant, it is consistent with prior work showing clinically insignificant reductions in cardiac function are associated with reduced cerebral blood flow.36 However, our counterintuitive observation would not survive a stringent FDR correction for multiple comparisons, emphasizing the need for future studies and replication.

The current study has several strengths, including a clinically well characterized cohort emphasizing participants free of clinical stroke along with excellent methods for quantifying LV mass index, CSF biomarkers, and cerebral white matter microstructure. The cohort is relatively healthy and free of cardiovascular disease, highlighting that even preclinical changes in cardiovascular structure affect brain health. Additional strengths include comprehensive ascertainment of potential confounders, application of mediation analyses to interrogate these complex associations, and application of a cluster enhancement permutation procedure in the DTI analyses to correct for multiple comparisons. Finally, core laboratories using quality control procedures analyzed all cardiac magnetic resonance, CSF, and magnetic resonance imaging measurements in batch, and technicians were blinded to clinical information. Despite these strengths, the study is cross-sectional and does not address dependency or directionality. Future work, including longitudinal studies, are needed to further examine neuroaxonal injury as a mediating pathway and the temporal nature of associations reported here. Some observations did not persist after strict FDR or cluster enhancement multiple comparison correction and many findings were null, emphasizing the need for replication. Additionally, future studies are needed to determine whether underlying changes in cardiac function or structure associated with an increased LV mass index may mediate associations with brain health and investigate associations between LV mass index and other markers of cerebral small vessel disease. Also, the cohort was predominantly non-Hispanic White with participants ranging 60 to 92 years of age, limiting generalizability. It should be noted that individuals included in this study were more likely be White, male, and have lower vascular risk than individuals excluded from analysis (Supplemental Table I). While these differences may affect the generalizability of our findings, it is likely that associations reported here would be more robust in individuals with greater vascular risk. Finally, results do not rule out additional pathways of etiologic connection between the heart and white matter health.

The current study offers a novel association between subclinical cardiovascular remodeling and greater in vivo molecular evidence of neuroaxonal degeneration among individuals with MCI and among APOE-ε4 carriers, even in the absence of comorbid cardiovascular disease. Results suggest neuroaxonal degeneration may be an important component in the pathway of injury between structural cardiovascular remodeling and cerebral white matter damage. Future research will elucidate whether early intervention on subclinical cardiovascular remodeling may be an important strategy in protecting brain health with increasing age.
