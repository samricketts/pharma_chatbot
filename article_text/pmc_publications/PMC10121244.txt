Background:

Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings between established multimodal dementia risk factors and non-invasive blood-based biomarkers may lead to greater precision and earlier identification of older adults at risk of accelerated decline and dementia. We examined whether key vascular and genetic risk impact the association between cerebral amyloid burden and plasma amyloid β (aβ) 42/40 in non-demented older adults.

Methods:

We used non-demented older adults from the University of California, Davis-Alzheimer’s disease Research Center (UCD-ADRC) study (n=96) and Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (n=104). ADNI was examined as confirmatory study cohort (CSC). We followed a cross-sectional design and examined linear regression followed by mediation analyses. Vascular risk score was obtained as the sum of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4+ risk was genotyped, and plasma aβ42 and aβ40 were assayed. Cerebral amyloid burden was quantified using Florbetapir-PET scans. Baseline age was included as a covariate in all models.

Results:

Vascular risk significantly predicted cerebral amyloid burden in ADNI but not in the UCD-ADRC cohort. Cerebral amyloid burden was associated with plasma aβ 42/40 in both cohorts. Higher vascular risk increased cerebral amyloid burden was indirectly associated with reduced plasma aβ 42/40 in ADNI but not in UCD-ADRC cohort. However, when stratified by APOE ε4+ risk, we consistently observed this indirect relationship only in APOE ε4+ carriers across both cohorts.

Conclusions:

Vascular risk is indirectly associated with the level of plasma aβ 42/40 via cerebral amyloid burden only in APOE ε4+ carriers. Non-demented older adults with genetic vulnerability to dementia and accelerated decline may benefit from careful monitoring of vascular risk factors directly associated with cerebral amyloid burden and indirectly with plasma aβ 42/40.

Graphical Abstract


pmcIntroduction

A complex and dynamic multifactorial risk network has been linked with the highly heterogenous nature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias. Current biomarkers to measure hallmark characteristics of AD include invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures and expensive amyloid and tau positron emission topography (PET) imaging1,2. Recent developments in advanced blood-based biomarker technologies have led to highly sensitive assays3 to measure amyloid in blood decades before the onset of symptoms4. Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of non-invasive and cost-effective blood-based biomarkers in relation to established amyloid PET markers will be fundamental to a broader application and earlier identification of cognitively unimpaired adults at high dementia risk and accelerated decline.

Ratio of amyloid β42 over amyloid β40 in plasma (plasma aβ 42/40) levels have been shown to accurately predict amyloidosis in non-demented older adult brains5 and may be an early predictor of amyloidosis6. While a strong association has been established between amyloidosis and plasma aβ levels7 with validation procedures underway8, a range of lifestyle factors and cardiovascular comorbidities also influence plasma levels7,9. Determining whether and how established modifiable risk factors impact the relationship between amyloid in the brain versus plasma will be necessary to understand their overall contribution to a larger heterogenous multifactorial risk network10.

One key modifiable risk domain that we examine in the present study is vascular risk. Vascular risk factors have been directly linked to cerebral amyloid burden in older adults11,12 and synergistic associations of vascular risk and amyloid burden has been associated with cognitive decline13. A range of inconsistent findings have been reported between vascular risk, amyloid burden, and plasma aβ 42/40 in the literature. For example, greater arterial stiffness was associated with greater amyloid burden after covarying for Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4+ risk and blood pressure14. APOE ε4 carriers with hypertension showed greater amyloid burden15 whereas, higher blood pressure levels were linked to greater plasma aβ 40 levels in APOE ε4 non-carriers16. The impact of vascular risk factors on amyloid deposition, therefore, may be exacerbated by genetic vulnerability. APOE ε4 genetic risk has consistently been identified with amyloid burden and accelerated decline in dementia and has also been shown to play an important moderating role in key associations between risk markers and cognitive decline17. APOE allelic risk and plasma aβ 42 may be combined to predict amyloid PET positivity in older adults at high dementia risk18.

In the present study, we took a multifactorial approach by examining how vascular and genetic risk work together to impact the validated association between amyloid burden and plasma aβ 42/40. We used an ethnoracially diverse cohort19 to test our research aims. First, we confirmed the association between amyloid burden and plasma aβ 42/40 in our diverse sample. Second, we investigated whether vascular risk predicts (1) plasma aβ 42/40, (2) cerebral amyloid burden, and (3) plasma aβ 42/40 through cerebral amyloid burden (indirect association). We hypothesized that higher vascular risk score would independently predict higher cerebral amyloid burden and lower plasma aβ 42/40 levels. Third, we tested an effect modification of APOE ε4-/ε4+ on the indirect association of vascular risk on plasma aβ 42/40 through cerebral amyloid burden. We hypothesized that higher vascular risk indirectly predicts plasma aβ 42/40 levels through cerebral amyloid burden and this association will be stronger in APOE ɛ4 carriers. Figure 1 displays the sequential steps to test this potential multimodal risk association. We aimed to validate our findings using the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data as a CSC.

Method

Data Availability Statement

Subject to IRB limitations, we share all data collected by the ADRC. In accordance with NIH policy on data sharing, we reserve the right of initial publication related to components of our data that are central to our research program for two years.

Participants

We used data from the University of California, Davis-Alzheimer’s Disease Research Cohort (UCD-ADRC)19, an ethnoracially diverse longitudinal study representing community dwelling older adults who are cognitively normal or diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment or demented. The UCD-ADRC and all data collection are in full and certified compliance with the human/institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives. UCD-ADRC data collection started from 2001 and is ongoing. Vascular risk factor and DNA data was collected at baseline. Cerebral amyloid burden data was collected between 2011–2018 and plasma aβ 42/40 between 2002–2019. Ethnicity and racial status were self-reported, and standard criteria and methods were followed for cognitive status diagnosis20. Participants received a multidisciplinary clinical evaluation using the Uniform Data Set battery20,21. For the present study, we used a subsample of cognitively normal participants with amyloid PET and plasma data (N=96; mean age=72.97 (6.14) years old, n women=60; see Table 1 and Figure 2). This manuscript follows the STROBE reporting guideline22.

CSC data was obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. We included n=104 non-demented older adults (mean age=73.59 (6.24) years; n women=56) from ADNI-2 recruited between 2011–2012 and ADNI-3 recruited between 2017–2021. Data collection for variables for interest were different. Specifically, non-demented (including 74 CN and 30 subjective memory complaints) (see Table 1 and Figure 2) participants with clinical, PET imaging, and APOE genotype data in the “ADNIMERGE” table and plasma data from “BATEMAN LAB” table downloaded on April 19, 2022, were included. Vascular risk factor scores were derived using risk factors in the Medication History and the Modified Hachinski tables.

Plasma amyloid β 42/40 collection

UCD-ADRC blood samples were randomly obtained, processed within 2 hours, and stored in 250 μL aliquots at −80°C using previously reported standard procedures23. ADNI plasma samples were assayed in the Biomarker core laboratory using Innogenetics research on a Luminex immunoassay platform24. Additional methodological details for plasma aβ are provided in the Supplementary Methods for the UCD-ADRC and on adni.loni.usc.edu for ADNI.

PET

Image acquisition

In the UCD-ADRC, florbetapir-PET scans were acquired on a Siemens Biograph mCT 40 PET machine during a 50-to-70-minute interval following a 10 mCI (370 MBq) bolus injection of florbetapir (18F)25. In ADNI, scans were acquired using 18F-florbetapir PET with 4 × 5-minute frames acquired at 50–70 minutes after injection26. PET analysis details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.

Genotyping

APOE genotyping for rs7412 and rs429358 were assayed from DNA by the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias27 in both the UCD-ADRC and ADNI. All ɛ2/ɛ4 case were excluded in the ADRC because of conflicting reports on ɛ2 protective effects versus ɛ4 risk associations28 and APOE genotyping in “ADNI merge table” was used for ɛ4−/ɛ4+ groupings. APOE ɛ4+ carriers were coded as 1 and non-risk carriers (APOE ɛ4-) as 0.

Vascular risk

Vascular risk score was obtained using five vascular risk factors in the UCD and ADNI. The presence (score of 1) or absence (score of 0) of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease was used in UCD-ADRC29. The presence or absence of hypertension, diabetes, stroke, smoking, and cardiovascular disease30 was used in ADNI. Higher score indicated greater severity (maximum score of 5). This vascular risk score obtained from categorical variables was then transformed into a percentage representing a continuous score of 0–1 in the UCD to account for missing values on one or more of the vascular risk factor questions. The average across non-missing data points was taken and divided by the number of non-missing data points. The 0–1 scale is a percent of non-missing items that shows positive symptoms/signs. The UCD-ADRC vascular risk score was recently developed to use across studies in the cohort and the ADNI vascular risk score was composed specifically for the present study. With no missing items in the ADNI vascular risk score calculation, we did not transform the ADNI vascular risk scores. All vascular risk factor information was obtained from each participant’s medical history and records, and any medications used at the initial evaluation in the clinic.

Statistical Analysis

Baseline participant characteristics were compared by APOE ɛ4 genotype using analysis of variance for continuous variables and a chi-squared test for categorical variables. Continuous measures were summarized using means and standard deviations whereas categorical measures were summarized using counts and percentages.

Regression analyses were used to test all three direct associations in Mplus Version 8.631. All dependent missing values were assumed to be missing at random and were estimated using maximum likelihood. Cases with missing predictor values were removed using list-wise deletion in Mplus. In the UCD-ADRC, we had missing data for vascular risk (n=1), plasma aβ 42/40 (n=1), and APOE (n=2). We did not have any missing data for variables of interest in ADNI. First, plasma aβ 42/40 was regressed on cerebral amyloid PET. Second, plasma aβ 42/40 was regressed on vascular risk score. Third, cerebral amyloid PET was regressed on vascular risk score. Indirect association between vascular risk and plasma aβ 42/40 through cerebral amyloid burden was tested with mediation model which calculates the indirect effect with bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CI) (using the Baron-Kenny method), where the dataset is resampled with replacement over 5000 iterations32,33. We further tested this as stratified APOE ɛ4-/ɛ4+ groups. Baseline age was included as covariate in all models. All models were identified with significant indirect effect when the association between vascular risk score and plasma aβ 42/40 through cerebral amyloid burden was significant.

Results

Demographics

In the UCD-ADRC, mean baseline age of participants was 72.97 (6.14) years with 62.5% women and average education of 14.68 (3.94) years. Cerebral amyloid levels were significantly lower in APOE ɛ4− (n=61) group compared APOE ɛ4+ (n=33) groups. In ADNI, mean baseline age was 73.59 (6.24) years with 54% women and average education of 16.66 (2.51) years. Cerebral amyloid levels were significantly lower in APOE ɛ4− (n=71) group compared to APOE ɛ4+ (n=33) groups. Descriptive statistics for all characteristics and comparisons by APOE ɛ4+ are presented in Table 1.

Direct associations between vascular risk, amyloid burden, and plasma aβ 42/40

We confirmed that cerebral amyloid burden was associated with plasma aβ 42/40 in both the UCD-ADRC and the ADNI CSC (Figure 3). As expected, higher cerebral amyloid burden was associated with lower plasma aβ 42/40 (UCD-ADRC:β=−0.012, SE=0.006, p=0.039; ADNI:β=−0.015, SE=0.006, p=0.013). Higher vascular risk score predicted greater amyloid burden in ADNI (β=0.043, SE=0.016, p=0.006) but not in the UCD-ADRC cohort (β=0.096, SE=0.050, p=0.053). Vascular risk was inconsistently associated with plasma amyloid aβ 42/40 across the two cohorts. Specifically, higher vascular risk was associated with higher plasma amyloid aβ 42/40 levels (opposite direction than expected) in UCD-ADRC (β=0.008, SE=0.003, p=0.007) but not in ADNI (β=−0.001, SE=0.000, p=0.416).

Indirect association of vascular risk and plasma aβ 42/40 through cerebral amyloid burden and as stratified by APOE ɛ4+ risk

Inconsistent associations were observed between the two cohorts for the indirect association of vascular risk on plasma amyloid aβ 42/40 levels through cerebral amyloid burden. Specifically, higher vascular risk indirectly predicted lower plasma amyloid aβ 42/40 levels in the whole group in ADNI but not in the UCD-ADRC cohort (UCD-ADRC:β=−0.001(90% CI= −0.003,0.000), SE= 0.001, p=0.078; ADNI:β=−0.001(90% CI=−0.002, 0.000), SE=0.000, p=0.006). However, when this was stratified by APOE ɛ4+ risk, we observed significant indirect association in both cohorts for APOE ɛ4 carriers (UCD-ADRC:β=−0.004(90% CI= −0.009,−0.002), SE=0.002, p=0.030;ADNI: β=−0.002(90% CI=−0.004,−0.001), SE=0.001, p=0.027) but not in the APOE ɛ4− group (UCD-ADRC:β=−0.001(90% CI= −0.002,0.000), SE=0.001, p=0.474; ADNI:β=0.000(90% CI=−0.001, 0.000), SE=0.000, p=0.515).

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, higher vascular risk score indirectly predicted lower plasma aβ 42/40 through cerebral amyloid burden only in APOE ɛ4 carriers. We validated our indirect association in APOE ɛ4 carriers using a CSC. Our findings suggest an indirect relationship of vascular risk factors on a key blood-based biomarker (aβ 42/40) through amyloid burden in non-demented older adults with high genetic susceptibility (APOE ɛ4 carriers).

Elevated cerebral amyloid burden has consistently been associated with lower plasma aβ 42/407. We confirm this fundamental association in both our cohorts and add to the increasing literature aimed at understanding the underlying mechanism between cerebral amyloid burden and plasma amyloid levels34. We note that plasma aβ 42/40 was lower in the UCD-ADRC versus the ADNI cohort, but the relationship between plasma amyloid and amyloid burden in the brain was observed in both groups. Our main goal which was to understand how this association changes when we account for vascular risk and APOE risk. Regardless of highly different demographics and smaller sample size, the association between amyloid in the brain and plasma is influenced by overall vascular risk score and this is only consistently observed in APOE ε4+ risk carriers. While our findings were based on cross-sectional data, future work will benefit from examining this association over time35 with larger sample sizes to fully capture the predictivity of plasma aβ 42/40 and amyloidosis in relation to neurodegeneration, disease pathology, phosphorylated tau, and cognitive decline.

Higher vascular risk contributed to greater cerebral amyloid burden but was inconsistently associated with plasma aβ 42/40. Vascular risk may contribute to AD pathologies by influencing aβ production/clearance36. Specifically, cholesterol and high blood pressure is associated with greater amyloid burden37. Elevated blood pressure may compromise vascular integrity leading to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and impaired aβ clearance from the brain38. Autopsy findings show that amyloid in combination with high blood pressure may deteriorate vessel walls and reduce clearance38. Arterial hypertension mouse models show that chronic hypertension may increase blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and lead to greater amyloid deposition in plasma. Thus, only when vascular risk is examined in conjunction with amyloid burden, the levels of plasma aβ 42/40 may be justified.

Inconsistent reports on vascular risk and AD pathology (i.e., amyloid and tau burden) in non-demented older adults highlight the need for more in-depth research and replication in this area11–13. With smaller sample size, we did not account for moderating effects of vascular medication use12 but these should be considered in future work. Cerebral aβ tends to increase before reaching a peak and then declining just before the onset of clinical symptoms which may also contribute towards inconsistent findings between cerebral aβ and plasma aβ39. We included non-demented older adults in our sample who may not have high amyloid burden and may not have reached their peak before the onset of clinical symptoms. Thus, longitudinal follow-up would help clarify the inconsistent findings for vascular risk factors and plasma aβ and further confirm the indirect association of vascular risk on plasma aβ through cerebral amyloid burden. Although we did not examine this in the present study, vascular association between amyloid and plasma aβ 42/40 should be tested in relation to tau deposition, the other major characteristic associated with AD34.

Non-demented older adults with both high vascular risk score and APOE ε4+ risk may be at a higher risk for amyloidosis. Our indirect findings suggest that vascular risk does not directly influence plasma aβ 42/40 but should be examined in conjunction with amyloid burden to fully capture the impact of vascular and genetic risk. Specific vascular risk factors such as hypertension and cholesterol may change the impact of APOE (a major cholesterol transporter in the brain) linked to cholesterol metabolism40. APOE ε4 isoform increases plasma low density lipoproteins suggesting that APOE ε4 carriers have increased cholesterol and vascular risk41. This leads to a higher aβ binding affinity which may indirectly contribute towards vascular and AD pathologies42. APOE is also known to have pleiotropic effect whereby ε4 carriers are at higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia in old age but show better performance and excellence in younger adults43. APOE ε4 carriers show high amyloid burden than the ε4− group44 and this is also observed in autopsy findings for non-demented older adults45. APOE protein is highly involved in maintaining BBB integrity thus a direct effect of amyloid clearance from the brain into plasma46. The integrity and permeability of BBB have been examined in mice47, where APOE ε4 carriers show greater permeability and increased transport across the BBB versus APOE ε3 groups leading to lower aβ clearance and impaired BBB directly influencing the amount of plasma aβ48.

Our study had strengths as well as limitations. A first strength is that we validated our main findings from an ethnoracially diverse cohort (composed of African-Americans, Hispanics, and Whites) through community recruitment to a large longitudinal observational study composed of mainly Whites recruited across the United States and Canada. We confirmed our findings even in highly differing populations. Second, by identifying how plasma amyloid is associated with other established non-modifiable and modifiable dementia markers, we contribute to the large literature and potential clinical application of blood-based biomarkers to detect high risk individuals.

Regarding limitations, first, we had a relatively small sample size (n=96) to test a complex multimodal risk association. However, we used a CSC (n=104) to confirm our findings and shortcomings associated with small sample size. Second, vascular risk factors in the risk score were slightly different between the two cohorts which may have resulted in only borderline significance in the UCD-ADRC. Third, we did not examine longitudinal associations and the absence of a longitudinal time order limits our mediation results in a cross-sectional alone. This should be the next step to test how these synergistic associations change with time and in other subpopulations including dementia groups. Fourth, although we examined both amyloid PET and plasma aβ 42/40 in non-demented older adults, future work should consider including CSF measurements to determine the role of CSF amyloid levels and neurodegeneration (linked to vascular risk, APOE, and amyloidosis) in this complex and dynamic network across the dementia continuum. Fifth, with a smaller sample size we did not test for any sex differences in plasma aβ 42/40 and should also be considered in future work.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our findings suggest that monitoring and enhanced management of vascular risk factors in non-demented older adults may provide adults with APOE ɛ4 risk an added layer of protection associated with high cerebral amyloid burden and lower plasma aβ 42/40. Vascular integrity in combination with genetic vulnerability are key components of preclinical trajectories. Thus, applying a multifaceted approach49 with established (cerebral aβ) and non-invasive (plasma aβ) biomarkers for earlier detection of older adults at high risk and personalized intervention programs will be key to offsetting projected increases50 in dementia incidence and prevalence.
