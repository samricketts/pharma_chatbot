Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by a progressive loss of selected neuronal populations. A significant risk factor for most NDs is aging. Considering the constant increase in life expectancy, NDs represent a global public health burden. Axonal transport (AT) is a central cellular process underlying the generation and maintenance of neuronal architecture and connectivity and appears to be a common thread for most, if not all, NDs. Neuroinflammation has been notoriously difficult to define in relation to NDs. Inflammation is a complex multifactorial process in the CNS, which varies depending on the disease stage. Several lines of evidence suggest that AT defect, axonopathy and neuroinflammation are tightly interlaced. However, whether these impairments play a causative role in NDs or are merely a downstream effect of neuronal degeneration remains unsettled. We still lack reliable information on the temporal relationship between these pathogenic mechanisms, although several findings suggest that they may occur early during ND pathophysiology. This article will review the latest evidence emerging on whether the interplay between AT perturbations and some aspects of CNS inflammation can participate in ND etiology, analyze their potential as therapeutic targets, and the urge to identify early surrogate biomarkers.

pmc1. Introduction

Adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) comprise a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and many others. Despite their different etiology and symptomatic manifestations, all NDs feature a progressive loss of selected neuronal populations.

Neurons are highly polarized cells, compartmentalized into two structurally and functionally distinct domains: the somatodendritic and the axonal compartments. Most neurons develop a single long axon and several branched dendrites. Because of the extreme morphological and functional polarization, the proper functioning of neurons largely relies on a tightly and spatiotemporally regulated cargo transport. Cargoes are shuttled along axons through a well-orchestrated microtubule (MT)-dependent process known as axonal transport (AT). The AT machinery consists of MTs, motor proteins, adaptors, and cargos [1]. AT occurs along the cytoskeleton, constituted of MTs, intermediate filaments, and actin filaments [1]. MTs are longitudinally aligned along the axon and function as “tracks”; motor proteins, including kinesin and dynein, move the cargoes along the MTs [1–4]. Adaptors function as linkers to anchor cargoes to the motor proteins and assist with cargo binding and localization [1]. AT controls the delivery of membrane-bounded organelles from the cell body to synaptic compartments, removes and degrades old materials, mediates the turnover of non-synaptic membranes, and metabolic and cytoskeletal elements needed to maintain the structural and biochemical heterogeneity that characterizes axonal subdomains [5]. Hence, AT can be regarded as a major cellular process underlying the generation and maintenance of neuronal architecture and connectivity throughout the lifetime of neurons [6].

From the early days of investigation on NDs, it has been hypothesized that defects in AT may be responsible for these disorders [7]. Now, deficits in AT appear to be a common thread for most, if not all, NDs. In fact, with the methodological ability to visualize AT processes, impairments in AT have been reported in many NDs, including AD, ALS, and PD [4, 8–10]. Several ND-causing genes are associated with the AT machinery [11]. Furthermore, AT can decline with aging [10, 12], a significant risk factor in many NDs. Axonal degeneration, also known as axonopathy, can occur due to physiological aging [13]. At the same time, axonopathy, like AT defects, can represent an early phenomenon during ND pathogenesis, preceding cell degeneration and the onset of clinical signs; this could have significant therapeutic implications [13].

Axonal damages contribute to many brain disorders triggered by inflammation and oxidative stress [14]. In the case of a prototypical inflammatory condition like multiple sclerosis (MS), axonal injury occurs from the onset of the disease [15–17], and it is the main contributor to long-term disability [18–20], suggesting that inflammation can directly affect axonal homeostasis. During the early inflammatory stages, axonal damage is mainly caused by microglial activation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction [21]. Sustained oxidative stress contributes to neuroinflammation and can result from the unregulated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which has also been implicated in many NDs [22–25]. Microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the brain - extensively examined in this issue - are activated in many NDs and release ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [26–28]. Mounting evidence suggests that increased levels of ROS play a crucial role in triggering axonal degeneration [22–24]. However, the timing of these events and their contribution to axonal damage and AT failure are not fully understood in non-inflammatory NDs.

These findings have drawn attention to the pathological mechanism(s) associated with AT defects and axonopathy in the context of NDs. Although it is widely accepted that disturbances in AT could be key pathological events that contribute to neurodegeneration, we lack an understanding of the causative relationship between AT defects and NDs. Whether AT defects impair neural homeostasis or are solely a consequence of degeneration remains largely unsettled.

This review aims to provide an overview and clarify the correlation between AT and axonal defects in NDs. Considering several pieces of evidence supporting a role of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress during early ND pathophysiology, we will try to dissect the mechanisms by which inflammatory events could contribute to AT dysfunctions and axonopathy. Also, we will analyze the therapeutic potential of targeting axonal dysfunctions and inflammation in NDs and discuss the urge to identify early biomarkers. Timely recognizing the events that lead to these deregulations will be critical to identifying possible therapies to prevent the axonal damage observed in NDs and slow down disease progression.

2. AT and neurodegeneration

An extensive amount of data supports the idea that AT blockage can impair neuronal homeostasis and contribute to the etiology or progression of NDs and has been the topic of intense investigation [1, 5, 9, 10, 29–39]. Initial evidence came from the neuropathological observations of MT arrangement disruption and dystrophic neurites, which in NDs exhibit morphological features indicative of transport defects [9]. These changes were initially interpreted as secondary to mutations or environmental insults like aggregated or oligomerized toxic proteins. By now, numerous studies have reported that mutations in genes implicated in NDs, or expression of proteins involved in these diseases, can dramatically alter the flow and dynamicity of AT [9], supporting a causative role of transport deficits in NDs.

Many mutations across the molecular machinery involved in AT have been identified and are associated with NDs (reviewed in [10, 11]). Many of these mutations are found on ubiquitously expressed genes [10]. Still, frequently these disease-causing mutations result solely in neurological symptoms, reinforcing the notion that AT deficits can be causative of neurological diseases.

Quantitative and qualitative alterations in the transport machinery have been extensively described in NDs. For instance, motor protein expression levels are altered in AD [40], ALS [41], MS [42], and PD [43] patients. Due to a compromised AT efficiency, cargoes accumulate abnormally, causing axons to focally swell [44]. Axonal swellings enclosing accumulations of mitochondria, vesicles, motors, and cytoskeletal components indicative of transport defects have been reported in several NDs [45–53]. As pointed out by Mike Coleman, [54], axonal spheroids, or smaller varicosities, commonly called axonal dystrophy, are almost ubiquitous in NDs [55]. Accordingly, early pathological events shared by neurons affected in NDs include synaptic dysfunction and axonopathy, characteristic of neurons undergoing dying-back degeneration [5, 51, 56–59], in which distal axons progressively degenerate toward the cell body. Brains from early-stage AD patients display axonopathy of basal forebrain axons before amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition [48], motor axons in ALS patients accumulate phosphorylated neurofilament (NF) proteins and organelles [60], axonal accumulation of synaptic vesicles and α-synuclein have been observed in hippocampal neurons of patients with PD [61].

Dystrophic axons in the context of prion diseases appear to be secondary to AT impairment, as first suggested by Gajdusek [7] back in 1985, and are frequently identified in prion-affected brains (reviewed in [62]). Axonopathy accompanied by axonal beading has been observed in vitro following exposure to mammalian prion protein fibrils [63]. These findings are further supported by recent work highlighting a role for AT in prion protein aggregate formation in axons, which eventually leads to dystrophic swellings, impaired calcium dynamics, and reduced neuronal viability [64].

Tau is a stabilizing MT-associated protein whose functions are mainly regulated by phosphorylation [65]. Therefore, by extension, tau protein dysregulations and loss of functions (e.g., gene dysfunction, aggregation, post-translational modifications, reviewed in [66, 67]) can directly affect AT dynamic. Disruption of the MT network has been extensively identified in a group of NDs called tauopathies, including AD. Tauopathies display pathological features consistent with a dying-back pattern of neuronal degeneration, including dystrophic axons and evidence of disrupted AT (reviewed in [68]). Pathological forms of tau protein have been directly associated with AT alterations in the context of these diseases. Importantly, these alterations seem to arise during the earliest stages of tauopathy pathogenesis (reviewed in [66]).

Multiple studies suggest that axonal degeneration occurs previous to the onset of clinical symptoms in many NDs, such as ALS [69], PD [70], AD [37], and HD [71]. Thus, it is plausible that AT deficits could trigger the early pathological alterations observed in NDs. However, compromised AT could also be a downstream effect of homeostasis dysfunction in affected neurons, and a decisive answer is currently lacking. Thus, both points of view may be correct.

Although AT impairments and axonopathy in NDs are widely identified, significant questions remain about the mechanisms and role of these alterations in neurodegeneration. The downstream pathophysiological contributors to AT defects in these diseases have not been fully elucidated.

3. Axonal pathology and AT defects: a role for oxidative stress and inflammation?

Inflammation can be outlined as a complex defense mechanism occurring in the body in response to perturbed homeostasis. The term “neuroinflammation” broadly describes the inflammatory processes occurring in the CNS involving both innate and adaptive immunity. This is a double-edged sword since cells involved in neuroinflammatory responses can induce beneficial or detrimental outcomes and contribute to physiological brain development and neuropathological events [72].

Numerous studies have shown that NDs have an essential immunological component. In addition to MS, a pure inflammatory neurodegenerative pathology, several lines of evidence indicate that many NDs feature a remarkable activation of CNS-resident macrophages, commonly known as microglia [73]. Microglia are the primary innate immune cells in the brain and have fundamental roles in CNS homeostasis. They form a heterogeneous network that influences development, surveys the parenchyma, reacts to damage- and pathogen-associated stimuli [74–76], and represent the first line of defense in the CNS (reviewed in [77]). The role of microglia and neuroinflammation in NDs has been extensively analyzed in this issue. Here we will focus on the emerging idea that microglia and oxidative stress might play a specific role in modulating AT and axonopathy and therefore contribute to ND pathophysiology.

The first line of evidence supporting a role of neuroinflammation in AT regulation comes from the observation that oxidative stress can inhibit AT. Oxidative stress results from the upregulated production of ROS and has been implicated in many NDs [22, 23, 25]. Oxidative stress and inflammation go hand in hand in aging and neurodegeneration [78]. Activated microglia are known to release ROS and RNS, including hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and superoxide [79]. In 2012 Fang and collaborators [26] demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide could inhibit the AT of mitochondria and Golgi-derived vesicles in murine hippocampal neurons. In this study, the AT inhibition occurred even before changes in mitochondrial morphology, which is among the earliest signs of ROS-induced axonal damage [80], and partially recovered following hydrogen peroxide washout. The effects on AT were seen after local axonal exposure to hydrogen peroxide in microfluidic devices, suggesting that these effects were not simply a result of neuronal degeneration [26].

Similarly, direct treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with low nitric oxide concentrations derived from activated microglia resulted in synaptophysin and synaptotagmin-1 AT dysfunction [81]. In most diseases characterized by inflammatory components, axons are expected to be chronically exposed to increased ROS and RNS starting at disease onset. This could induce enduring AT inhibition and may have harmful consequences on neuron function and survival [33]. Although the molecular mechanism of oxidative stress-induced AT inhibition is unclear, ROS-mediated activation of protein kinases can induce kinesin phosphorylation, inhibiting AT [59, 82, 83]. Deregulation of AT by protein kinases has been implicated in various NDs, including ALS, HD, and AD (reviewed in [84]).

In AD, axonal swellings have been associated with intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ [85, 86], which can stimulate the production of ROS [87–90] and consequentially induce axonopathy and AT failure. On the other hand, extracellular amyloid deposition is also known to cause MT disruption and mislocalization of MT-associated motors [91]. As Aβ can trigger progressive hyperphosphorylation of tau, promoting its dissociation from MT [92], tau can also be regarded as one of the mediators of Aβ-induced AT deficits and axonopathy [93, 94]. We have recently demonstrated that GGA3 loss of function causes impairment of BACE1 AT [45]. Increased BACE1 in the axon is predictive of enhanced amyloidogenic pathways and Aβ accumulation, further disrupting AT, as confirmed by the rescue of BACE1 defective transport following β- or γ-secretase inhibition [45].

Mitochondrial AT defects can contribute to excitotoxicity and oxidative stress and are one of the earliest AT dysfunction observed in response to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in neurodegeneration [8]. In D. melanogaster, ROS-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial AT has been reported in vivo and in vitro. The AT flux and velocity reduction were specific for mitochondria and did not affect other organelles [95]. Interestingly, elevated ROS increased Ca2+ intracellular levels, and reduction of Ca2+ to physiological levels rescued ROS-induced defects of mitochondrial AT. At the same time, in vivo activation of the JNK pathway reduced mitochondrial AT, while JNK knockdown partially rescued ROS-induced defects in the anterograde direction [95], reinforcing a role for protein kinases ROS-mediated regulation of AT. Elevated Ca2+ levels activate the JNK pathway [96]. While Ca2+ can inhibit mitochondrial transport in both directions [97–99], ROS-impaired mitochondrial transport was not fully rescued by reducing Ca2+ levels, suggesting that other factors might be involved in ROS regulation of mitochondrial AT.

Similarly, in rat hippocampal neurons, either exogenous treatment or intracellular generation of ROS decreases mitochondrial motility in a dose-dependent manner [100]. Both pharmacologic and genetic targeting of p38 kinase appeared to exert a protective effect. Furthermore, anchoring mitochondria directly to kinesins without the mediation of the adaptors avoided the ROS-induced decrease in mitochondrial motility, indicating that ROS likely target the adaptor complex and p38 functions as the intermediary of this mechanism. Errea and collaborators found by in vivo imaging that mitochondrial AT deregulation is the earliest dysfunction of axonal mitochondria in response to neuroinflammation and oxidative stress [14]. A substantial decrease in the transport velocity was present in both anterograde and retrograde directions [14]. Mitochondria are a significant site for producing and scavenging ROS that serve as both a mediator and a regulator of Ca2+ signaling and are relevant for mitochondrial function regulation [100]. However, the work by Debattisti et al. showed that in Ca2+ pre-depleted cells, mitochondrial motility decay upon H2O2 treatment didn’t correlate with increased intracellular Ca2+ levels [100], suggesting that ROS can inhibit mitochondrial AT independently of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Ca2+-induced motility arrest could involve ROS. Intracellular Ca2+ elevation can trigger ROS generation by enhancing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, further reducing the mitochondrial redox machinery or promoting the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) [101–104]. mPTP formation triggers mitochondrial permeability transition, leading to increased axonal ROS and intra-axonal Ca2+ release [105, 106]. mPTP formation has been linked to the pathogenesis of NDs, including AD [107], PD [108], and ALS [109]. During neuroinflammation, Ca2+ can accumulate in the axoplasm through pathological calcium channel activity and nanoscale ruptures of the axonal plasma membrane, promoting extracellular calcium entry and arresting mitochondrial transport [110].

Microglia have been shown to contact neurons at various points, like dendrites, cell bodies, synapses, and axons. Microglia-axon interactions have long been known to elicit multiple effects in developing and remodeling neural circuits under physiological conditions and following injury and diseases (reviewed in [111]).

One striking feature of microglia in AD brains is their marked clustering around Aβ deposits, close to dendrites and dystrophic axons [112–116]. Due to their vicinity to axonal structures and their potential for releasing neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory factors - as discussed in this issue - some suggest that microglia are causative of dystrophic neurites [117]. Although human genetic data argue that proper microglial function can be protective against axonal damage and could play a neuroprotective role through mechanisms not yet fully identified [118], there is ample evidence that rampant microglia activity can be harmful to neurons in NDs [119]. As discussed above, ROS and RNS microglia-mediated production could directly affect axonal integrity and AT. Still, no other direct evidence linking the detrimental role of microglia to axonopathy and AT failure has been identified.

Evidence in favor of a microglia protective role comes from the observation that in AD mouse models, peri-plaque areas devoid of microglia are less compact but have high Aβ42 affinity, leading to the formation of protofibrillar Aβ42 hotspots associated with more severe axonal dystrophy [120]. The findings that the degree of axonal dystrophy around plaques is inversely correlated with microglia plaque envelopment and that CX3CR1 knockdown and anti-Aβ immunotherapy reduce dystrophic neurites strongly suggest that microglia could exert a neuroprotective role [120]. The authors propose that microglia could act as a physical barrier that insulates plaques from surrounding axons, reduces their contact with potentially harmful Aβ, and prevents axonopathy. TREM2 gene is specifically expressed by microglia in the CNS [121]. A loss-of-function R47H mutation in TREM2 constitutes one of the strongest single allele genetic risk factors for AD [122, 123], providing a solid link between microglia dysfunction and AD pathogenesis. It was reported that heterozygous mutations in TREM2 increase the risk not only for AD but also for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, ALS, and PD [124]. More recently, the same authors hypothesized that disruption of the microglia barrier function is a cellular mechanism underlying the association between loss-of-function TREM2 mutations and increased risk of AD. STORM imaging analysis demonstrates that in human AD brains carrying the R47H TREM2 variant and in TREM2 deficient mice, axonal dystrophy around plaques is dramatically increased compared to AD cases carrying wild-type TREM2 and is accompanied by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau [125]. They also observed a strong anti-colocalization between microglia processes and hyperphosphorylated tau-positive dystrophic neurites, suggesting that microglia usually exert a protective shielding effect [125]. Bemiller and collaborators [126] demonstrated that TREM2 deficiency leads to exacerbated and earlier onset of tau phosphorylation coupled with dysregulation of stress-activated kinase pathways, leading to premature AT alterations. In contrast to Aβ, the effects of tau on microglia activation have been less explored. Overexpression of human tau significantly affects microglia clustering around Aβ deposits by inducing microglia relocalization away from the sites of Aβ deposition [127]. There is evidence that chronic exposure to pathological tau could induce the premature senescence of microglia by impairing their function following tau phagocytosis [128, 129]. Consequently, the chronic stimulation of microglia exposed to pathological tau species may impair their activity at the level of the neuritic plaques [127]. In light of a role of microglia as a protective barrier that separates amyloid plaques from neurites and prevents axonopathy, tau modulation could be considered a promising therapeutic target.

These findings reinforce the idea of a protective function of microglia in AD. A 2020 analysis showed that TREM2 deletion in mice exacerbates axonal pathology around amyloid plaques and induces elevation of NfL, a biomarker of axonal damage, in the CSF [130]. Accordingly, Parbo et al. found that in early and prodromal AD patients, low plasma levels of NfL correlate with increased C-PK11195 binding, a marker of microglial activation/neuroinflammation [131]. As raised plasma NfL appears to reflect axonal degeneration, these findings support the idea that neuroinflammation can play a protective role during AD early stages. Moreover, they suggest a rationale for stimulating microglial activity in early and prodromal AD, possibly with immunotherapy targeting toxic protein aggregations. Plasma NfL levels could be used to measure the protective efficacy of immune stimulation and monitor the effectiveness of putative neuroprotective molecules [131]. Interestingly, TREM2 variants are also associated with an increased risk of Nasu-Hakola disease, a form of recessively inherited presenile dementia [132, 133]. Nasu-Hakola patients develop axonal degeneration, loss of white matter, and cortical atrophy. They exhibit increased microglial density and activation, suggesting a dysregulated pro-inflammatory response [134].

Even though indications supporting a direct role for microglia, oxidative stress, and inflammation in axonopathy regulation in AD are emerging, evidence for other NDs remains fragmented and elusive. While these diseases are highly heterogeneous and characterized by different pathological hallmarks, they share similar pathophysiological processes. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that what we are starting to unveil on the link between microglia and axonopathy in AD may function as a bridge to better comprehend their correlation in other NDs.

4. Therapeutic strategies

As AT defects seem to be an early pathological change in NDs, restoring these defects requires significant attention to design potential therapeutic strategies. The AT machinery could, in fact, be targeted at different levels: MTs, motors, adaptors, or cargoes. Many pharmacological compounds targeting AT are currently moving into clinical trials after showing favorable results in animal models [135].

A non-specific, although promising approach would be modulating the MT dynamics and increasing their stability. In principle, stabilizing the “tracks” that support the entire AT machinery early in the disease could help prevent dysfunctions and delay the progression of the pathology before permanent damage occurs.

Several studies report beneficial outcomes of MT-stabilizing drugs, developed initially as antimitotic agents for cancer treatment (reviewed in [136]). Obviously, it would be undesirable to affect dividing cells in patients with NDs. The ideal approach would be to use low doses of brain penetrant MT-stabilizing drugs to balance MT abnormalities in diseased brains without radically affecting dividing cells in the periphery, then minimizing systemic side effects. So far, MT-stabilizing compounds have shown positive results in various models of NDs, including AD, ALS, and PD [136]. Although many of the most common MT-stabilizing treatments do not readily pass the blood-brain barrier [137], the epothilone family was found to be fully brain-penetrant [137]. Epothilone D (EpoD) has an excellent brain exposure and the ability to increase the level of acetylated-tubulin for prolonged periods after a single administration [137]. Clear benefits were observed in multiple NDs after treatment with EpoD without peripheral complications [136]. However, treating tau transgenic mice with a different MT-stabilizing compound, dictyostatin, induced gastrointestinal complications and increased mortality, indicating that not all brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing agents are equally effective and safe [136]. Another hurdle in moving MT-stabilizing drugs into clinical trials is the absence of a marker of target engagement which complicates dose optimization studies in humans [136].

MTs rely on specific tubulin isotypes. Except for α-tubulin 8, all α-tubulins undergo acetylation on lysine-40 [138]. Tubulin acetylation has been proposed to stabilize long-lived MTs flexibility [139, 140]. The histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) has become a popular target for increasing acetylation levels of MTs. It has been found that deletion or inhibition of HDAC6 restores AT in a D. melanogaster model of PD [141], rescues AT dynamics in iPSC-derived motor neurons from ALS patients [11], and reverses AT deficits in mouse models of ALS [142]. Moreover, inhibitors of HDAC6 increase vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neuronal cells bearing HD mutations [143].

Another potential mechanism for AT regulation is through MT-associated proteins (MAPs) that bind along MTs and modulate the interaction of motors with the MT surface [144]. Tau is a neuronal MAP that bundles and stabilizes MT in the axon [145]. Previous studies suggest that tau impairs AT by promoting motor protein dissociation from MTs [146] or disrupting motor protein–cargo interactions [147]. Previous studies demonstrated that tau reduction prevents defects of AT of mitochondria and TrkA receptors induced by Aβ [94, 148]. Intracerebroventricular injection of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that promote the degradation of MAPT mRNAs effectively lowered overall tau levels in the brains of rodents and nonhuman primates. Tau-targeting ASO injections were well tolerated and are undergoing a phase 1 safety assessment in people with early AD [149, 150].

Mutations in motor protein-encoding genes cause AT defects in NDs. Thus, modulating motor proteins could represent an alternative therapeutic strategy to restore AT deregulation. Several kinases regulate AT by directly phosphorylating motors and adaptors (reviewed in [5, 10, 11, 84]). Disruptions in kinase signaling pathways that are crucial for maintaining AT have been reported in several NDs [5, 84]. For instance, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) can negatively regulate AT through phosphorylation of motor and cytoskeletal proteins [83] [151], and its overactivation in patients and mice with ALS seems to contribute to the impairments in fast and slow AT [83, 152–154]. In SOD1G93A ALS transgenic mice, inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB-239272 or SB-239063 can restore signaling endosome AT dynamics [155]. GSK3β modulates vesicle transport [156] and can also regulate the dynein-dependent AT [157]. In a mouse model of AD, inhibition of GSK3β activity by SB415286 restores Aβ-induced AT deficits in primary cortical neurons [93]. In HD, JNK3-mediated phosphorylation of kinesin heavy chain 5C caused by mutant huntingtin can trigger AT dysfunctions [158]. Calcineurin inhibition was protective against mutant huntingtin-mediated toxicity and rescued AT deficits in murine neuronal cultures [159, 160].

Despite these findings, modification of protein kinase activity in the CNS has its challenges [161]. Many protein kinases have, in fact, an array of targets beyond those related to AT and are involved in various physiological processes across different cell types and signaling cascades [162–164]. Also, the complexity of the AT machinery is enormous and partly still unknown, making it very hard to design a differential approach focused on a specific aspect of AT regulation.

Inflammation-directed therapies for NDs can be broadly divided into therapies that target components or cells of the immune system and treatments that utilize the immune system for clearing or targeting aberrant proteins, including vaccine or passive antibody therapies [165]. In light of the complexity of CNS immunity, consideration of upstream and downstream effects of immune-directed therapies is essential since it can affect therapies’ mechanism of action and the risk of adverse events [165]. The success of microglia targeting therapies faces several complications. Microglia are closely related to immune cells found ubiquitously in the body. So, it is reasonable to believe that targeting microglia could affect the systemic immune response. Moreover, the dynamic nature of microglia muddies this scenario: different brain regions can, in fact, show different levels of microglial activation. Unfortunately, most molecules won’t discriminate among different microglia activation statuses. Another important consideration is the timing of intervention during disease onset and progression of these therapeutic approaches. Microglia function in NDs is not fully characterized and can act as a double-edged sword depending on disease progression. The potential of pharmacological strategies targeting microglia in different NDs has been broadly reviewed [166–169], and new insights are emerging rapidly.

Passive immunization against misfolded toxic proteins is a promising approach to treating NDs. In this context, passive anti-Aβ immunization indirectly increases the number of microglial cells around Aβ plaques [127, 170]. Importantly, anti-Aβ immunization prevents the formation of tau-positive dystrophic neurites around amyloid plaques [127], reinforcing a role for microglia in modulating axonopathy. This effect is coherent with the study discussed above, showing that impaired TREM2 activity, which perturbs microglia clustering around Aβ plaques, increases the level of phosphorylated tau in neuritic plaques. Since TREM2 variants are associated with diverse NDs [171–173], it is conceivable that the mechanism described for AD, in which dysfunctional microglia loses its capacity to protect axons from dystrophic-inducing events acting as a barrier, could apply to other NDs, characterized by deposition and aggregation of toxic proteins. In this view, passive immunization therapies could represent a promising approach to preventing AT dysfunction and axonopathy in NDs. Along these lines, in mouse models of PD overexpressing α-synuclein, antibodies directed against α-synuclein were shown to attenuate axonal damage, reduce the accumulation of truncated α-synuclein in axons and rescue the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase fibers in the striatum [174].

It has been suggested that the primary cause for the failure of most therapeutic strategies targeting NDs depends on the fact that these interventions occur too late in the disease course. During the later stages of the pathology, the damage to the CNS might be too great to achieve any significant improvement in symptomatic manifestations [175]. Further, the damage induced by the neuroinflammatory responses might be irreversible due to a neurotoxic CNS microenvironment that is overwhelmed by the presence of misfolded protein aggregates. Therefore, it is critical that therapeutic interventions targeting neuroinflammation, AT deregulation, and axonopathy, are implemented as early as possible in the course of the disease. Unfortunately, this is often hampered by the lack of surrogate disease onset or progression biomarkers.

Because of the evident interplay between neuroinflammation and axonal pathology and NDs’ heterogeneous and complex etiology, we must consider that monotherapies won’t represent an effective approach. Instead, combination therapies might be a powerful strategy comparable to those implemented in other chronic illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Treatment with a cocktail of drugs owning different mechanisms of action might increase drug efficacy by stimulating synergistic or additive effects, allowing the use of lower doses to improve tolerability and safety, and possibly minimizing severe side effects. Still, combination therapies might trigger additive toxicity from simultaneous administration of multiple drugs.

Although there are still many unsettled issues to tackle, such as the proper timing of intervention, therapy duration, and adverse events of the therapeutic agents, combination therapies should be developed not only to assess efficacy in symptomatic patients but also as preventive measures in cognitively normal individuals with biomarker evidence of an increased risk to develop NDs, as we already do for many other chronic conditions.

5. Biomarkers of axonal damage and inflammation

An increased understanding of the events that lead to ND has implicated axonal dysfunction as an early sign of disease pathology [176]. These observations originate first from pathological studies [43, 58] and, more recently, from functional imaging in living patients [177] and emphasize the importance of the axon as a distinct subcellular target of ND pathophysiology [178–180]. With synaptic degeneration, axonopathy seems to precede clinical manifestations by many years. Due to its dynamic and complex pathophysiology, axonal damage progression can only be partly monitored by MRI [181, 182]. Thus, tools to identify early signs of axonal or synaptic pathology in ND are becoming of great value if we are to try to avert or halt the progression of these pathologies. Moreover, monitoring drug response to therapies for axonal protection is essential to transition fundamental discovery into translational models and clinical applications.

Following axonal damage, various proteins get released and diffuse into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. At present, the most reliable markers of axonal injury are represented by NF and tau proteins [181, 183, 184].

Post-translational tau modifications may lead to MT disassembly and impaired AT [183]. Tau proteins are released from neurons into the interstitial fluid, CSF, and blood, and increased CSF total tau levels reflect ongoing neuronal and axonal loss [183]. Evidence suggests that CSF total tau is highly sensitive to the neuronal vulnerability [185]. Nevertheless, tau localizes in both somas and axons and reflects both cortical and subcortical damage and thus is not extremely specific as an axonal injury surrogate biomarker. On the contrary, neurofilament light (NfL), a structural protein central to axonal stability, seems more specific than total tau [186].

NF proteins released upon axonal injury have emerged as one of the most sensitive biomarkers for monitoring degeneration [186–192]. Quantification of NfL levels has allowed the assessment of disease onset, progression, and prognosis in multiple NDs. While NfL is released at a constant and low level from axons under physiological conditions, following axonal damage, concentrations of NfL in CSF can increase up to 40 times [182, 186]. Several studies have detected increased levels of neurofilament heavy (NfH) and NfL in CSF in various NDs such as MS [193], PD [194], AD [195], ALS [196], and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) [189]. NfL level variations in CSF and plasma correlate with disease severity, so they can be considered prognostic indicators of disease progression and outcome [93,94]. In MS, for instance, axonal injury occurs early in the pathology, and degeneration continues as the disease progresses [188]. This degeneration correlates with NfL levels, and increased levels are detected in the relapsing-remitting phase of the disease [186, 197]. NfL levels appear to be responsive to MS treatment [198]. In AD, cognitive decline and neuronal loss correlate with increased plasma and CSF NfL; interestingly, a peak in the rate of increase parallel AD onset [182, 186, 199–201]. A 2019 longitudinal study found that changes in serum NfL levels were a predictor of presymptomatic AD [199]. Similarly, a correlation between higher plasma NfL levels and PD clinical progression has been identified [200, 202], including at the early stages of the disease.

Obtaining CSF samples has been an obstacle to the extensive use of NfL as a diagnostic and clinical tool. In recent years, it was observed that NfL could also be detected in plasma or serum, though at lower levels than in CSF, making detection with traditional ELISAs difficult and ineffective [203]. A recent breakthrough was developing an ultrasensitive detection method that uses immobilized arrays of single molecules termed single molecule arrays (SIMOA) [176]. The advent of plasma and serum NfL detection with SIMOA has allowed the overall evaluation of NfL levels in clinical trials, varying from a few to thousands of patients [176]. Several studies have demonstrated that plasma, serum, and CSF NfL levels are tightly correlated [204]. Finally, these studies and others suggest that while NfL is an excellent predictive biomarker for axonal damage and cognitive dysfunction in NDs, it is also a non-disease-specific biomarker [205, 206].

Synaptic loss represents an early event linked to axonal damage as a measure of progressive neurodegeneration. Moreover, substantial evidence shows that synaptic dysfunction is an early event in the pathogenesis of many NDs [207], particularly in AD [208, 209] and PD [210]. Among putative CSF biomarkers, neurogranin (Ng) has been proposed as one of the most promising [211]. Ng is a calmodulin-binding postsynaptic protein, abundantly expressed in soma and dendrites (reviewed in [207]), and it is involved in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity [189, 207]. A series of clinical studies have confirmed the validity, sensitivity, and specificity of CSF Ng in diagnosing both advanced stages of AD and prodromal AD. Numerous studies indicate that Ng levels in the CSF are higher in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment than in healthy controls or non-AD demented patients [212–215]. In PD, the correlation between Ng CSF levels and pathology progression remains unclear. Some studies suggest elevated Ng levels [216], while others observe reduced Ng levels in PD patients compared to healthy controls [217]. Data on many other NDs, including HD and CJD remain highly controversial. So far, despite some promising results, no clear evidence demonstrates that Ng represents a disease-specific and reliable biomarker. More studies are needed to uncover the potential applications of Ng in clinical practice.

Like Ng, 14-3-3 proteins are a family of regulatory molecules, highly expressed in the brain, and are considered markers of neuronal damage and synaptic loss [218]. 14-3-3 proteins are particularly enriched at the presynapses, regulating synaptic activity and remodeling [189]. Interestingly, 14-3-3 specific isoforms are found elevated in the CSF of CJD patients. The detection of CSF 14-3-3 in these patients is generally accepted as part of the current diagnostic criteria [218–220]. The elevation of 14-3-3 proteins in CSF also occurs in other diseases that cause acute or subacute neuronal damage, including AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and might suggest rapid disease progression [189, 221]. Beyond these, other proteins expressed mainly at the presynaptic level, such as SNAP-25, synaptotagmin-1, and GAP-43, are emerging as synaptic dysfunction markers and warrant further investigation [211].

Changes in the concentrations of several cytokines and other inflammatory biomarkers have been extensively investigated in NDs [181, 189, 214, 222–224]. These changes can potentially reflect CNS inflammatory mechanisms coupled with neurodegenerative pathways [222]. Nevertheless, inflammatory signaling molecules may diffuse for short distances among cell networks and contribute locally to inflammation without necessarily diffusing into CSF in detectable amounts [225]. A promising marker frequently measured as a surrogate of neuroinflammation in NDs is YKL-40 [189, 213, 214, 226, 227]. YKL-40, recognized as chitinase 3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1), is a chitin-binding lectin that belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 [228, 229]. Some studies have suggested that YKL-40 is expressed in astrocytes in various acute and chronic neuroinflammatory conditions [230, 231], while others support that YKL-40 is also expressed in microglia [231]. Astrocytic YKL-40 expression is under the control of microglial stimuli since YKL-40 transcription is induced by the macrophage-released proinflammatory mediators interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α [229]. YKL-40 is upregulated in several neurological conditions such as stroke, lentiviral encephalitis, traumatic brain injury, ALS, MS, CJD, and AD [230, 232–235]. Previous work found elevated YKL-40 in the CSF of AD patients [232, 236, 237]. The CSF concentrations of YKL-40 were significantly increased during the AD prodromal phase compared to cognitively normal controls [238, 239], indicating that the immune system activation occurs early in the disease. Evidence suggests that CSF levels of YKL-40 correlate with tau levels, not only in AD but also in various tauopathies [236, 237, 240, 241]. Interestingly, increased levels of YKL-40 predicted progression from mild cognitive impairment to symptomatic AD and other types of dementia [214]. Inconsistent data have been generated on YKL-40 correlation with markers of neurodegeneration [213, 237, 239, 242, 243] as well as with cognitive decline [213, 240, 242, 244].

Biomarkers have the enormous potential to improve diagnostic accuracy, disease monitoring, prognosis, treatment efficacy, and target engagement in clinical trials. It is broadly accepted that the pathophysiology underlying many NDs originates years before clinical symptoms, with axonopathy and inflammation being among the first pathological signs. Therefore, it is conceivable that implementing an array of biomarkers targeting both axonal dysfunctions and inflammation could synergically facilitate the identification of NDs early in the etiologic processes. The struggle to identify effective treatments has been partly ascribed to implementing candidate therapies at a disease stage too advanced to blunt the disease triggering mechanisms or slow early progression. There is a pressing need for reliable non-invasive biomarkers for NDs to facilitate diagnosis, predict disease progression, and monitor therapeutic intervention.

6. Conclusions

Because of the complexity of the human CNS, NDs that disrupt its operation have been challenging to understand and treat. Although most NDs share some features, such as adult-onset and progressive accumulations of toxic proteins in the brain parenchyma, we are still missing the critical piece that differentiates individuals who develop neurodegeneration and associated cognitive decline from others who can preserve their cognitive function during physiological aging. The emergent consensus proposes that NDs are multifactorial disorders characterized by various pathogenic pathways.

This review examined the evidence supporting a coordinated role of inflammation, oxidative stress, and axonopathy in ND pathophysiology. Based on the existing data, we speculate that these pathophysiological processes can cooperate in initiating neurodegenerative phenomena (Graphical Abstract). While AT dynamic can be directly compromised by many primary causes (e.g., AT machinery protein mutations, loss of function, or deregulation), other elements can simultaneously come into play, such as aging and aggregation of toxic proteins. These phenomena can acutely elicit oxidative bursts and trigger microglial activation. In response to such stimuli, microglia can initiate a neuroinflammatory response to recruit additional cells, clear injurious agents, and maintain the brain homeostasis [245]. We hypothesize that throughout ND progression, microglia can assume a protective role during the early phases; persistent and uncontrolled neuroinflammation, however, can induce neurotoxicity, leading microglia to progress into a dysfunctional state, ultimately becoming deleterious. Besides the findings on ROS and RNS release, we still lack clear and incontrovertible evidence of a role of overactivated microglia in inducing AT failure and axonopathy. Oxidative stress and inflammation are notoriously self-sustained and might initiate a self-perpetuating loop that, in this view, can aggravate the axonal pathology identified in NDs. In this scenario, microglia cells could lose their capability to act as a defensive barrier that isolates axons from toxic stimuli. Dysregulation of TREM2-mediated pathways can also compromise microglial homeostasis and contribute to this pathophysiological mechanism.

Could axonal pathology and neuroinflammation represent suitable therapeutic targets in NDs? Recent findings suggest that targeting these elements might be promising and that monotherapies won’t effectively cure these heterogeneous diseases. Therefore, we must envision a therapeutic approach based on combination therapies. Another piece of the puzzle must be put into place, and this is the urgent need for reliable and specific surrogate biomarkers. The development of biomarker arrays will be necessary to identify dysfunctions, such as axonopathy and neuroinflammation, pre-clinically and monitor therapeutic strategies’ effectiveness.

We believe that a more comprehensive understanding of the AT dynamics and their interplay with axonopathy and neuroinflammatory processes early in the disease phase combined with improved monitoring procedures will significantly impact treatment options for NDs. This will require a broad collective effort and extensive collaborative and multidisciplinary studies.
