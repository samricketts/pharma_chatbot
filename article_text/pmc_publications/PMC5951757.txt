Objectives

MRI has become an indispensable tool for brain volumetric studies, with the hippocampus an important region of interest. Automation of the MRI segmentation process has helped advance the field by facilitating the volumetric analysis of larger cohorts and more studies. FreeSurfer has emerged as the de facto standard tool for these analyses, but studies validating its output are all based on older versions. To characterize FreeSurfer’s validity, we compare several versions of FreeSurfer software with traditional hand-tracing.

Experimental design

Using MRI images of 262 males and 402 females aged 38 to 84, we directly compare estimates of hippocampal volume from multiple versions of FreeSurfer, its hippocampal subfield routines, and our manual tracing protocol. We then use those estimates to assess asymmetry and atrophy, comparing performance of different estimators with each other and with brain atrophy measures.

Principal observations

FreeSurfer consistently reports larger volumes than manual tracing. This difference is smaller in larger hippocampi or older people, with these biases weaker in version 6.0.0 than prior versions. All methods tested agree qualitatively on rightward asymmetry and increasing atrophy in older people.

Conclusions

FreeSurfer saves time and money, and approximates the same atrophy measures as manual tracing, but it introduces biases that could require statistical adjustments in some studies.

Introduction

The hippocampus is a part of the medial temporal lobe, playing an important role in spatial and episodic memory [Squire et al., 2004]. The ability to measure hippocampal volume in humans via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has identified reduced hippocampal volume as a biomarker for numerous conditions [Geuze et al., 2005], including major depressive disorder (MDD) [Campbell et al., 2004; Videbech and Ravnkilde, 2004], epilepsy [Cook et al., 1992; Geuze et al., 2005; Jack et al., 1990; Jack, 1994], post-traumatic stress disorder [Logue et al., 2017], and Alzheimer Disease (AD) [Gosche et al., 2002; Jack et al., 1998; Kesslak et al., 1991], as well as normal aging [Allen et al., 2005; Du et al., 2006; Raz et al., 2004b; Raz and Rodrigue, 2006; Walhovd et al., 2005; Walhovd et al., 2011]. Increasing MRI availability and concurrent reductions in costs have led to a proliferation of MRI data in ever larger studies and data sets.

Determining hippocampal volume from MRI has been accomplished through varied manual [Boccardi et al., 2011; Jack, 1994; Konrad et al., 2009] and automated [Alemán-Gómez et al., 2006; Fischl et al., 2002; Moghaddam and Soltanian-Zadeh, 2009; Platero and Tobar 2016; Smith et al., 2004] methods. Manual tracing has long been considered the gold standard, allowing for flexible quantification without many of the assumptions built into algorithms. Experienced human tracers can correctly mark ambiguous boundaries, with adjustments for variation in complex or atypical anatomy and image artifacts. But this flexibility introduces variability in any manual protocol. Tracing both hippocampi can also take an expert several hours, resulting in prohibitive expense for today’s large and growing MRI data sets. See [Turner, 2014] for a review on the growing size of imaging studies. In pursuit of a reliable technique that will scale up with growing studies, several algorithms have been created to automate the segmentation process. FreeSurfer was selected for its availability, ease of use, nearly full automation, and higher accuracy than alternative algorithms [Morey et al., 2009; Sánchez-Benavides et al., 2010; Schoemaker et al., 2016; Tae et al., 2008; Wenger et al., 2014].

Automated techniques are often published with a brief validation of their output, but insufficient independent validations comparing manual tracing to automated replacements exist, particularly with evolving software. Existing studies of FreeSurfer’s reliability use relatively small numbers of participants and older software versions [Morey et al., 2009; Sánchez-Benavides et al., 2010; Schoemaker et al., 2016; Tae et al., 2008; Wenger et al., 2014]. We are unaware of any studies that assess validity of current FreeSurfer 6.0.0 software, hippocampal subfield algorithms, or assessment of handedness. To fully characterize the differences between modern FreeSurfer segmentations, prior FreeSurfer versions, and our manual tracing protocol, we compared manually traced left and right hippocampi to FreeSurfer 5.3.0 and 6.0.0 segmentations of MRIs from 664 participants from the Genetics of Microangiopathic Brain Injury (GMBI) study.

To investigate methodological similarities and differences directly, we compared raw and total intracranial volume (TIV)-adjusted hippocampal volumes by both value and voxel-wise percent agreement. To answer the more salient question of whether these methods’ quantitatively different results provide accurate and comparable estimates for biologically relevant measures, we also investigated right-left asymmetry and an assessment of atrophy over the adult lifespan using data from each method. Finally, to determine the ongoing existence of previously reported age and volume biases [Wenger et al., 2014], we investigated consistency in differences between methods relative to differences in participants’ ages and hippocampal volumes.

Methods

Participants

The initial sample comprised 708 non-Hispanic white participants, age 37 to 93, 41% male, 93% right-handed, from Rochester, MN who underwent MRI between August 2001 and February 2006 as part of the GMBI study. Participants were recruited into GMBI from the Rochester Epidemiology Project [Melton, 1996], based on at least two members of each sibship having hypertension before age 60. The sample undergoing full analyses in this study was a subset of 664 images, age 38 to 84, 39% male, 94% right-handed. Exclusions are shown in Table I. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Mayo Clinic, Rochester and The University of Mississippi Medical Center. All participants gave written informed consent prior to participation.

MRI acquisition

MRIs were captured with the same clinical GE Signa 1.5T MRI scanner, maintained over time with recommended software updates, as a component of the GMBI Study between 2001 and 2006. The complete protocol included several sequences as described previously [Knopman et al., 2008]. This study used 0.9375mm × 0.9375mm × 1.6mm voxel T1-weighted coronal 3D spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) images (256×192×124 matrix, 6–10ms echo time, 24ms repetition time, 25-degree flip angle, 24cm × 18cm × 19.8cm field of view). TIV were previously measured manually from 2D T1-weighted sagittal images (32 slices, 5mm thick; no gap, 256×192 matrix, 14–20ms echo time, 500ms repetition time, 24cm field of view) [Knopman et al., 2008]. To rule out the potential for bias introduced by changing scanner software, we assessed hippocampal volume, TIV, contrast to noise ratio (CNR), and signal to noise ratio (SNR) over the image acquisition dates. All four relationships, after including age in the model, were insignificant, failing to support any effect due to scanner changes. Moreover, FreeSurfer's scan-rescan reliability has been shown to remain high even across significant hardware and software upgrades [Jovicich, et al. 2009].

Manual tracing

708 MRIs were initially available for analysis. We followed a previously published protocol for tracing hippocampal boundaries [Jack et al., 1995]. Briefly, we used MIPAV (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization) software (RRID: SCR_007371) [McAuliffe et al., 2001] to orient the image coronally, then rotated the image around the left-right axis until the hippocampus aligned horizontally. We saved the reoriented image and traced the outline of each cross-sectional slice of hippocampus from the caudal end, where the fornix separates from the hippocampus in the lateral ventricle, to the rostral end, where the hippocampal head diminishes beneath the amygdala. We saved the coordinates of all boundary points to calculate the area of each slice, then multiplied areas by the slice gap to approximate hippocampal volume.

MRIs were obtained in Analyze format. For 26 (3.7%) of 708 images, neurologic vs radiologic orientation could not be determined reliably. They were excluded along with 3 images with extensive artifacts that could not be traced, one image with a large tumor, and 5 (0.7%) images with no TIV measurements available, leaving 673 manually-traced images (Table I).

We distributed the workload of manually tracing hippocampi between two trained experts, MFS and KBF, both authors of this manuscript. A third tracer, BD, was also trained, but contributed tracings only for inter-rater reliability, including Figure 1, in this study. These tracings were periodically recalibrated by reviewing and discussing segmentations. Repeated intra-rater and inter-rater reliability studies found consistent agreement between scorers and no sign of drift over time. TIV were measured previously [Smith et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2005].

Automated segmentation

All 708 MRIs available for manual tracing, including those known to be problematic, were segmented by FreeSurfer versions 5.2.0, 5.3.0, and 6.0.0 (RRID: SCR__01847) [Fischl et al., 2002]. Each 3D SPGR image was processed with default settings on the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research SuSe Linux cluster, but with additional flags for supplemental hippocampal-subfield and brainstem-structures routines in version 6.0.0. Each recon-all process was allocated a single Xeon E5420 2.5GHz processor and 6GB RAM. FreeSurfer is documented and freely available for download online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and has been thoroughly described elsewhere [Fischl et al., 2002; Fischl, 2012, Iglesias et al., 2015]. Scripts used to manage this project are also freely available online [Schmidt, 2017].

FreeSurfer 6.0.0 failed with errors on 25 (3.5%) images. FreeSurfer 5.3.0 failed on the same 25, and one additional. FreeSurfer 5.2.0 failed on 32 (4.5%), including all images with errors on 5.3.0. Two (0.3%) images, successfully processed with FreeSurfer 5.2.0 and 6.0.0, generated no errors with FreeSurfer 5.3.0, but failed to complete on multiple attempts. Error-free output from FreeSurfer was manually reviewed by displaying each segmentation result (mri/aseg.mgz file) in tkmedit, part of the FreeSurfer software suite. This quality control step revealed 6 (0.8%) images with incorrect orientation, and two (0.3%) with insufficient quality or contrast. Four (0.6%) images had severe ventriculomegaly, but were not excluded as the segmentation was successful by all methods. FreeSurfer 6.0.0 data were used to represent FreeSurfer in all comparisons to manual tracing, unless specified otherwise. Standard hippocampal volumes were extracted from the “Left-Hippocampus” and “Right-Hippocampus” fields in FreeSurfer’s aseg.stats file for each of three software versions.

We also compared two volumes assembled from FreeSurfer 6.0.0’s hippocampal subfields processing stream [Iglesias et al., 2015]. The “subfields” or “sf+” volumes come from FreeSurfer’s “Whole_hippocampus” field in the hippoSfVolumes files. As the most obvious difference between FreeSurfer's atlas and our protocol's hippocampal boundaries is FreeSurfer’s inclusion of tail tissue, we derived a “subfields-T” or “sf−“ volume, by subtracting the “Hippocampal_tail” field from the “Whole_hippocampus” field. It is intended to represent a closer approximation, and fairer comparison, to our manual traces.

Comparisons

Comparisons between automated and manual methods were conducted four ways, all in R (RRID:SCR_001905) [R Core Team, 2017]. First, direct comparisons were made between raw volumes reported by each method. Multiple comparison algorithms were employed due to differing strengths and weaknesses of each. A) Pearson pairwise correlations (r) and B) Simple linear regression (r2) measure the tendency for one variable to rise or fall with another, making them good measures of agreement for studies more concerned with change in volume than raw volume. C) paired t-tests (p) demonstrate whether means differ between raters. D) Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated using the R “psych” package [Revelle, 2017], as defined by Shrout and Fleiss for a two-way random effects model, also called ICC(2,1) [Shrout and Fleiss, 1979]. ICCs are considered the best tool for inter-rater comparisons when comparable raters provide comparable values. FreeSurfer and manual tracing, however, have historically provided significantly different values. This between-group difference in means is penalized by ICC, resulting in lower ICC scores even when volumes are well-correlated.

Raw hippocampal volumes are reported in all analyses. TIV-adjusted hippocampal volumes (equation 1) are added where appropriate. TIV-adjustments are calculated by regression rather than simple volume/TIV ratios as described previously [Jack et al., 1989; Arndt et al., 1991]. Adjusting based on regression assures the exact adjustment needed to cancel out the relationship to TIV, is more likely to result in normally distributed adjusted volumes, and maintains the units and approximate range of the original volumes. This calculation required first regressing hippocampal volumes on TIVs to obtain a β coefficient, then adjusting hippocampal volumes on the difference between each individual’s measured TIV and its expected value relative to measured hippocampal volume. Manual hippocampal volumes were adjusted to manual TIVs; FreeSurfer volumes were adjusted to Freesurfer-supplied eTIVs; right and left hippocampal volumes were adjusted independently. (1) HVoladj=HVolraw−β(TIVraw−TIVmean)

HVolraw and TIVraw refer to the measured values for a given participant. TIVmean refers to the mean TIV of the sample.

Second, to attain a more accurate assessment of agreement, respecting location in addition to volume, overlap of specific voxels was assessed. Dice’s coefficient is the only comparison algorithm in this study able to account for agreement on the location of the hippocampus within the MRI. To generate Dice’s coefficients, manually traced images were first registered onto the FreeSurfer aseg.mgz with AFNI tools [Cox, 1996; Cox and Hyde, 1997; Gold et al., 1998] to ensure coordinate consistency. Masks were created from the manual tracings using MIPAV and compared to an uncompressed copy of FreeSurfer’s labeled aseg.mgz image in three dimensions with Gnu Octave [Eaton et al., 2015]. Scripts used for this process are freely available online [Schmidt, 2017]. The ratio below is expressed as Dice’s coefficient [Dice, 1945] (equation 2) as performed in the original FreeSurfer report [Fischl et al., 2002]. (Fig 1) (2) Dice=|A∩B|+|B∩A||A|+|B|

A represents voxels selected by segmentation A; B represents voxels selected by segmentation B. |A∩B| represents the voxels selected by both A and B.

Third, an asymmetry index was calculated as suggested by prior literature [Hasan and Pedraza, 2009] (equation 3) and an additional Cohen’s d value (equation 4) was calculated for comparisons to published meta-analyses [Pedraza et al., 2004]. Statistical significance is reported as a one-sample t-test with a null hypothesis of asymmetry = 0. (3) asymmetry=2(volright−volleft)(volright+volleft)

(4) d=(1−34n−9)(volright−volleftσpooled)

Fourth, we assessed volume by each technique over age, and compared the level of atrophy calculated from each method. Change cannot be directly measured in our cross-sectional sample, so annualized atrophy was quantified with a generalized linear model regressing volume on age with a log link function and a gamma distribution. Exponentiated coefficients represent percentage annualized difference in volume, or “atrophy.” A value of 0.010 implies that 1.0% of volume is being lost each year.

To assess stability and consistency of segmentation algorithms over age and volume, data from each method of segmentation, and comparison measures between methods, were compared to age and traced volumes via linear regression models. Comparison measures and log-linear relationships were also compared across age strata: &lt;55; 55–70; &gt;70 as assessed in a recent meta-analysis [Fraser et al., 2015].

Power analyses were performed in R with the “pwr” package.

Results

Of the 708 MRIs available for analysis, 664 remained after all exclusions. Our sample was 39% male, averaged 61 years of age (SD=9.2 yr), and was exclusively non-Hispanic White from Rochester, MN. The volumes reported from each method are in Table II (Fig 2). Manual tracing resulted in significantly smaller (left Δ −641mm3, 95%CI: −663 to −618, p&lt;0.0001; right Δ −680mm3, 95%CI: −703 to −657, p&lt;0.0001) volumes than FreeSurfer 6.0.0. We detected FreeSurfer biases relative to age and size (Fig 3). The difference between FreeSurfer and tracing diminished with increasing traced volume in versions 5.3.0 (−0.15mm3 difference per mm3 volume increase, 95%CI: −0.20 to −0.09, p&lt;0.001) and 6.0.0 (−0.21 mm3 difference per mm3 increase, 95%CI: −0.26 to −0.17, p&lt;0.001). The difference also decreased with increasing age in FreeSurfer version 6.0.0 (−12.1mm3 smaller difference per year of age, 95%CI: −16.5 to −7.8, p&lt;0.0001), although to a lesser extent than in version 5.3.0 (−22.8mm3 smaller difference per year of age, 95%CI: −27.5 to −18.0, p&lt;0.0001). The age bias is strengthened by including a TIV adjustment in the linear model (6.0.0: −17.3mm3, smaller difference per year of age, 95%CI: −21.4 to −13.2, p&lt;0.0001; 5.3.0: −27.1mm3, 95%CI: −31.7 to −22.5, p&lt;0.0001).

Surprisingly, the mean “whole_hippocampus” measure from FreeSurfer 6.0.0’s hippocampal subfields routine (sf+) was also significantly smaller than FreeSurfer’s default “aseg” values (left Δ −488mm3, 95%CI: −500 to −476, p&lt;0.0001; right Δ −508mm3, 95%CI: −520 to −496, p&lt;0.0001) and only slightly larger than traced values (left Δ 153mm3, 95%CI: 133 to 173, p&lt;0.0001; right Δ 172mm3, 95%CI: 152 to 192, p&lt;0.0001) (Fig 2). Although sf+ measures were nearer traced volumes in value, their biases by volume (−0.27 mm3 difference per mm3 increase, 95%CI: −0.32 to −0.23, p&lt;0.0001) and age (−12.81mm3 smaller difference per year of age, 95%CI: −16.7 to −8.9, p&lt;0.0001) were similar to aseg measures (Fig 4).

Pearson’s correlations between manually traced hippocampi and FreeSurfer 6.0.0-segmented hippocampi were r=0.77 (left r=0.73, right r=0.76). ICCs were 0.32 on the left and 0.34 on the right, kept low by the between group volume difference. And linear regression reported r2=0.60 (left r2=0.54, right r2=0.57) (Table III). All three measures were higher for FreeSurfer 6.0.0 than 5.3.0, but even higher for sf+. Hippocampal volumes from FreeSurfer 6.0.0 are also smaller than those from FreeSurfer 5.3.0 (Left Δ −144.0mm3, 95%CI: −159.9 to −128.2, p&lt;0.0001; Right Δ −83.3mm3, 95%CI: −98.3 to −68.4, p&lt;0.0001), which were comparable (Left Δ 8.7mm3, 95%CI: −3.6 to 21.0, p=0.165; Right Δ 9.9mm3, 95%CI: −1.7 to 21.5, p=0.095) to those from version 5.2.0.

Rightward asymmetry was detected in both right and left-handed subgroups by both manual tracing (right-handed: n=620, +2.51%, 95%CI: 2.02% to 3.01%, p&lt;0.0001; left-handed: n=40, +1.70%, 95%CI: −1.17% to 4.57%, p=0.238) and FreeSurfer 6.0.0 (right-handed: +3.08%, 95%CI: 2.63% to 3.53%, p&lt;0.0001; left-handed: +2.79%, 95%CI: 0.46% to 5.12%, p=0.020). But smaller numbers of left-handed participants resulted in reduced confidence and loss of statistical significance in manually traced left-handed participants. (Table IV). In the entire sample, right hippocampi were larger than left in all methods (p &lt; 0.001) (Fig 2).

FreeSurfer volumes overlapped traced volumes with Dice’s coefficient of 76% between right hippocampi and 75% between the left in both versions 6.0.0 (n = 700 comparisons) and 5.3.0 (n = 699). These agreements remained the same for right-handed and left-handed participants. Overlap between 6.0.0 and 5.3.0 was 88% on the left and 87% on the right. FreeSurfer 6.0.0’s sf+ measure showed slightly higher overlap with manual traces of 78% on both right and left, and overlapped FreeSurfer 6.0.0’s aseg volume at 83% on the left and 84% on the right. We assessed inter-rater reliability by comparing overlap for 13 images traced multiple times by different tracers (n=25 comparisons), resulting in a Dice’s coefficient of 82% on both right and left sides. Intra-rater reliability came from repeated tracings of 4 images, all by the same author (n=22 comparisons) with Dice’s coefficients of 88% on the right, and 86% on the left. FreeSurfer is a deterministic process, reporting identical volumes on each assessment of the same input image, resulting in intra-rater agreement of 100%. All comparisons are shown in Table III and an illustration of overlap is shown in Fig 1. See Supplemental Fig S1 for all slices.

Estimates of hippocampal atrophy differed only slightly between segmentation methods. Manual tracing reports an overall 0.31% (95% CI: 0.21%, 0.41%) annualized atrophy rate (Left 0.28% [95% CI 0.18%, 0.38%], Right 0.34% [95% CI: 0.24%, 0.44%]) compared to 0.41% (95% CI: 0.33%, 0.49% p=0.117) annualized atrophy (Left 0.40% [95% CI: 0.32%, 0.49% p=0.066], Right 0.42% [95% CI: 0.34%, 0.51% p=0.230]) via FreeSurfer 6.0.0. Assessed separately by age group, atrophy estimates are higher in older participants and lower in younger participants, regardless of segmentation method. (Fig 5, Table V)

Discussion

FreeSurfer segmentations generated larger hippocampal volumes and masks than those from our manual tracing protocol. Interestingly, using volumes from the hippocampal subfield protocol reduced that discrepancy and increased agreement with manual tracings. Volumes from each method were well-correlated, however, with adequate overlap, and biases detected in earlier versions of FreeSurfer have improved slightly in version 6.0.0. Most importantly, all techniques reported smaller hippocampal volumes and higher atrophy rates in older vs younger participants, and rightward asymmetry. Within the demographics represented by our cohort, these results suggest that, while quantitatively different, FreeSurfer and manual tracing support similar answers to the biologically relevant estimation of atrophy.

Our results agree with previous literature that FreeSurfer reports larger volumes than manual protocols [Cherbuin et al., 2009; Morey et al., 2009; Sánchez-Benavides et al., 2010; Tae et al., 2008; Wenger et al., 2014] and that right hippocampi are slightly larger than left, on average [Hasan and Pedraza, 2009; Jack et al., 1989; Li et al., 2007; Tae et al., 2009]. Our estimates of annualized atrophy, 0.31% with manual tracing and 0.41% with FreeSurfer both fit into the low end of previous reports, which range from 0.28% to 6.38% per annum [Fraser et al., 2015; Raz et al., 2004a; Raz and Rodrigue, 2006]. Atrophy rates in AD patients, for comparison, have been reported at 3%–8% per annum [Barnes et al., 2009; Raz and Rodrigue, 2006]. Our low atrophy could be explained by our sample’s mean age of 61.3, about a decade younger than most studies of aging and dementia. Stratifying by age reveals higher atrophy in older members of our cohort, 1.1% per annum in 129 participants over 70, similar to the 1.1% reported in controls over 70 [Fraser et al., 2015] and 1.4% reported for similarly-aged controls in AD studies [Barnes et al., 2009] (Fig 6). Stratification suggests that the association between hippocampal volume and age is nonlinear (Fig 5), in agreement with [Walhovd et al., 2005], who used FreeSurfer segmentation, and [Raz et al., 2004a], who manually traced. However, both our manual and automated results suggest an opposite relationship prior to age 40 than that suggested by [Allen et al., 2005], who used manual tracing. All comparison studies reported on healthy participants across the adult lifespan.

FreeSurfer was selected from several automated segmentation tools. It is widely and freely available, well-automated, well-documented, actively developed, and easy to implement. Previous studies reported that earlier versions of FreeSurfer agree more closely with manual methods than other common tools, FSL/FIRST [Morey et al., 2009; Schoemaker et al., 2016] or IBASPM [Tae et al., 2008]. Some hippocampus-specific classification systems [Tangaro et al., 2014; Platero and Tobar, 2016] and the Automatic Brain Segmentation System [Hosseini et al., 2016] have outperformed FreeSurfer in hippocampus-specific segmentations. FreeSurfer has also been shown to be more sensitive to the atrophy coincident with MDD than alternatives [Morey et al., 2009]. Independent scans of the same individual show imperfect, but consistent agreement between FreeSurfer analyses [Morey et al., 2010]. These advantages combined with the benefit of continuing active development made FreeSurfer our best option for automated hippocampal segmentation. The most recent version, 6.0.0, reduces the volume discrepancy (Fig 2) and volume bias (Fig 3). There are no perfect tools, however. Investigators are responsible for basic manual validation of any tool's output and FreeSurfer provides no exception. FreeSurfer documentation (available online) and training prescribe manually checking several steps throughout its process to ensure reliable segmentations. In this study, 708 images were submitted to FreeSurfer, including 27 images with incorrect orientation data. 21 of the 27 misoriented images generated errors and failed, making manual checks unnecessary, but 6 images were registered sideways to the atlas, completed the process “successfully” and generated incorrect data. These were only excluded from our analyses after manual review of all segmentations. Two other images caused FreeSurfer to fail, but generated no error messages, leaving partial data for analysis and reinforcing the need for manual review. The necessary step of manually quality-checking output requires under a minute per observation, comparing favorably to the hours required for manual tracing. Researchers reap many benefits from automation, but expecting complete autonomy from any software is irresponsible and increases the risk of noisy data and misleading results. These potential issues do not represent a problem with FreeSurfer, but reinforce the need for users to manually review, and even edit intermediates, before using final FreeSurfer measurements to test hypotheses.

Manual tracing, broadly defined, is considered the gold standard in segmentation studies due largely to the human ability to deal appropriately with abnormal data. But there are at least 71 published protocols for manually tracing hippocampi [Boccardi et al., 2011; Konrad et al., 2009], and even the same protocol can result in different volumes if performed at different angles through the image [Hasboun et al., 1996]. Defining any of these protocols, or none, as the narrowly defined gold standard is controversial [Boccardi et al., 2011; Boccardi et al., 2013; Hasan, 2009] as objective reality depends on varying definitions of anatomical boundaries in addition to the technical anomalies inherent to any protocol. Despite this controversy, the most commonly cited protocols were merged into a single harmonized protocol by the European Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium (EADC) and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) between 2008 and 2013 [Boccardi et al., 2011; Boccardi et al., 2013; Boccardi et al., 2014; Frisoni et al., 2015; Frisoni and Jack, 2011]. Our tracing work began in 2012 and employed a protocol [Boccardi et al., 2011; Jack, 1994] that was later merged into the EADC-ADNI harmonized protocol. It is precisely defined and well-established, but it differs from the Center for Morphometric Analysis (CMA) guidelines [Makris et al.,] underlying FreeSurfer’s atlas. First, [Jack, 1994] and [Watson et al., 1992] define the caudal boundary of the hippocampus as “the coronal section in which the crus of the fornix is seen in full profile” while CMA recommends inclusion of further caudal regions, resulting in larger tails. Second, FreeSurfer segmentations tend to include partial voxels between hippocampus and lateral ventricle that are more often excluded in manual tracings [Cherbuin et al., 2009; Han and Fischl, 2007; Tae et al., 2008]. Both of these differences contribute to FreeSurfer’s larger volumes, which were 20% larger than their manual counterparts using 6.0.0, and 24% larger using 5.3.0, consistent with previous reports of 26% with FreeSurfer 4.3 [Cherbuin et al., 2009] and 38% with FreeSurfer 3.04 [Tae et al., 2008].

Regardless of manual tracing’s status as the gold standard, the labor cost of hand-tracing is prohibitive for large studies, making automation the default method, and periodic re-calibration studies like this one critical. Manual hippocampal tracing costs approximately $23.00 per subject (2 hippocampi * 1 hour each * $23,376 per year / 2,000 paid hours per year), based on recommended graduate student stipend rates [NIH, 2016]. Our FreeSurfer 6.0.0 processing, including 59.4 minutes (SD=7.9) for hippocampal subfields, took an average of 20.2 hours per subject (SD=4.4hrs). FreeSurfer 5.3.0 required 17.6 hours (SD=2.7hrs) without hippocampal subfield processing. FreeSurfer 5.2.0 took only 8.4 hours (SD=3.5hrs) per participant, but was run on faster hardware. Though our computing costs were donated, costs of running FreeSurfer on commodity computing resources, like Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud would require approximately $1.89 (1 run on t2.large instance for 9.4 cents per hour * 20.2 hours) or $1.43 (15 concurrent runs on a r4.4×large instance for $1.06 per hour * 20.2 hours) per subject [Amazon Inc., 2017] once the free software pipeline [Schmidt, 2017] has been set up. Moreover, FreeSurfer provides segmentations for dozens of subcortical structures by multiple atlases and cortical metrics that would incur additional costs to replicate manually. Ideally, tools like FreeSurfer will continue to allow for cost-effective segmentations while periodic re-assessments of new versions allow for consistent interpretation of the published research findings based on them.

Concerns have been raised about FreeSurfer 5.3.0’s overestimation of volume being relatively smaller in older participants [Wenger et al., 2014], which could skew age-related interpretations in older samples. Considering the wide use of FreeSurfer in cognitive aging studies, this represents a significant concern. After stratifying our sample by age, FreeSurfer 5.3.0 overestimated by 28% in those under 55, 23% in those between 55 and 70, and 21% in those over 70, qualitatively replicating Wenger, et al’s reduction of overestimation in the elderly (with smaller hippocampi). The same analysis fails to detect that bias in FreeSurfer 6.0.0, with overestimations of 23%, 19%, and 20%. Using a linear model to assess the overestimate over age revealed a coefficient of −23mm3 per year with version 5.3.0 and a lessened, but still significant, coefficient of −12mm3 per year with 6.0.0 (Fig 3). Consequently, calculations of annualized atrophy based on FreeSurfer 6.0.0 data match results from manual tracings more closely than older versions. (Fig 5, Fig 6, Table V). Our sample’s youngest participant was 38 when scanned, however, preventing us from precisely replicating Wenger, et al’s 20–30 year-old sample. This improving, but still present age bias presents a statistical challenge not only when comparing studies based on human tracing to those using FreeSurfer volumes, but also when comparing results using different FreeSurfer versions.

The right hippocampus is likely to be larger than the left, although some studies have reported the opposite [Pedraza et al., 2004]. All methods used in this study support the consensus in reporting rightward (positive) asymmetry (Table IV), which is slightly less pronounced in left-handed participants. Previous studies of automated tools occasionally mention handedness, but none have had large enough samples to assess potential effects [Cherbuin et al., 2009; Wenger et al., 2014]. This study assessed asymmetry in 40 left-handed and 620 right-handed participants, giving us more power to detect a handedness effect than any we’ve found to date. The differences in asymmetry index between right- and left-handed participants were still insignificant for all versions (e.g., manual tracing p=0.438, and FreeSurfer 6.0.0 p=0.760), suggesting no handedness effect, and that excluding left-handed participants from studies of hippocampal symmetry is unnecessary.

Relating hippocampal volumes to other variables often requires statistically adjusting volumes by TIV. This report includes both raw and TIV-adjusted volumes where appropriate for valid comparison with other literature. Manually-traced hippocampal volumes have been adjusted relative to manually-traced intracranial volumes. FreeSurfer segmentations have been adjusted relative to Freesurfer-generated TIV (eTIV in FreeSurfer files). This comparison likely reflects real-world scenarios where one complete pipeline would be selected over the other as a unit, and is therefore appropriate in the context of comparisons between methods. For studies investigating the relationship of hippocampal volume to another variable correlated with TIV, it may be more appropriate to adjust both hippocampal volume measures by the same TIV measure to reduce variance. Manually traced TIV correlated well with FreeSurfer TIV (version 6.0.0: r=0.84; version 5.3.0: r=0.83), indicating agreement between methods. Atrophy calculations were not significantly affected by adjustments for TIV (Fig 5 A vs B, Table V), suggesting that atrophy may occur independent of original volume.

One idea to alleviate FreeSurfer's slight age bias is the creation and use of age-specific templates. This could result in more accurate individual segmentations, but is complicated by atlas selection biases and more difficulty in comparing results. Both FreeSurfer and human tracers in this study were blinded to all demographic information, including age and sex. Providing different templates to FreeSurfer based on age would remove that blind, and introduce an explicit age bias. Assuming bias could be dealt with statistically, determining whether a group of younger people, using young templates, differed from a group of older people, using elderly templates, would be impossible as the difference in templates introduces an alternate explanation for any differences found. One interesting possibility to address both problems may be if FreeSurfer could algorithmically create or select a template on-the-fly, based on a subset of existing templates, that more closely matches the subject under analysis. FreeSurfer would still be blinded to actual age, but may algorithmically select younger templates simply because the subject brain is more like them anatomically. This would remove explicit age-bias while still adjusting for apparent age and making the apparent-age-adjusted values part of the objective algorithm.

The objective of this study was to compare manual tracing to several methods and versions of FreeSurfer segmentation, using default settings and templates to represent the most common FreeSurfer use cases. To that end, our main comparison variables were from FreeSurfer's aseg-derived hippocampal volumes. Two alternate measures, sf+ and sf−, were also introduced to the analyses: sf+ simply to investigate FreeSurfer’s improved hippocampal subfield routines [Iglesias et al., 2015]; and sf− to bring FreeSurfer’s segmentation boundaries closer to our manual tracing protocol. The difference between the smaller-than-expected whole_hippocampus subfield (sf+) and aseg-reported hippocampal volumes (Fig 2) resulted in sf+ having higher agreement with manual tracing than any other method tested. These results, even with similar biases to the aseg-based volumes (Fig 3, Fig 4), suggest the potential use of sf+ volumes rather than the aseg volumes in future studies focused on the hippocampus. This suggestion is further supported by improved Alzheimer disease discrimination using subfields’ whole_hippocampus over aseg volumes [Iglesias et al., 2015].

This study has numerous limitations. It is limited by its narrow focus on the hippocampus and its selection of a single automated segmentation pipeline. FreeSurfer reports 45 subcortical volumes in addition to cortical volumes and areas from multiple atlases for potential comparison to manual segmentation methods. This study also focused on FreeSurfer to the exclusion of multiple other automated segmentation tools. The original 1.5T MRI acquisition parameters resulted in 0.9375mm × 0.9375mm × 1.6mm voxels, which were resampled to 1mm isotropic resolution for FreeSurfer processing. The resampling has the potential to introduce biases to FreeSurfer’s segmentation, relative to images originally obtained at 1mm isotropic resolution. The 1.5T field strength used here differs from the 3T strength being adopted in many present and future studies. Similar analyses with 3T MRI would provide valuable additions to this study as well as extending [Hao et al., 2006] and [Iglesias et al., 2015]. Moreover, our cohort represents only normal controls aged 38 to 84. Investigating these biases in younger people [Wenger et al., 2014] and people with disorders previously associated with hippocampal atrophy are important future directions.

A strength of this study is the collection of 664 MRI scans, complete with manual tracings and FreeSurfer segmentations. We are unaware of any comparably sized collection of manual tracings, particularly from a community sample covering males and females ranging so widely in age. This size allows sufficient statistical power to calculate atrophy in three independent age-based subgroups, without losing statistical significance. But it still does not contain enough left-handed participants to detect significant right&gt;left asymmetry in left-handers alone. Power analyses report that 83 participants are necessary to have a 90% chance of detecting the volume biases we reported at a p=0.05 level for FreeSurfer 6.0.0 or 43 participants for sf+. Smaller studies may be subject to these biases, but be underpowered to detect and report them, even with both automated and manually traced volumes.

Many older population-based studies, like GMBI or its related ARIC study, would benefit from reprocessing existing images with newer versions of FreeSurfer. Each study could provide additional insights with a minimal expenditure of new funds. Having results from multiple field strengths would provide replication potential, richer information about the similarities and differences between field strengths, and a broader picture to feed meta-analyses. This report provides relevant information to investigators considering that approach and those who might seek to interpret their efforts in a larger context.

In summary, we found that FreeSurfer continues to report larger hippocampal volumes than manual tracing, in agreement with prior reports. The larger volumes correlate well with manual tracings, however, and show acceptable agreement in overlap analyses. Moreover, FreeSurfer and manual tracing report similar results in assessment of hippocampal atrophy over the lifespan, in line with prior studies [Fraser et al., 2015]. Our results indicate that FreeSurfer is an adequate, although not directly comparable, replacement for manual tracing, provided manual assessment of input images and output segmentations for exclusionary criteria relevant to each investigation.

Fig 1 Method of comparing overlap

(A) All slices of one left hippocampus from the tail (posterior) on top to the head (anterior) on bottom, as traced by 3 humans (colors) and segmented by FreeSurfer (hatched). (B) One representative hippocampal slice, circled in A, is expanded into each scorer’s assessment. (C) Volumes are calculated by summing all slices for each scorer, reported with overlapping voxel counts, then voxels by human and FreeSurfer individually. Overlap is reported as Dice’s coefficient. H1, H2, and H3 indicate three independent human scorers; FS indicates FreeSurfer. All slices of this representative hippocampus are shown enlarged in supplemental Figure S1.

Fig 2 Different methods of segmentation result in significantly different values for raw hippocampal volume

All versions of FreeSurfer report larger volumes than manual tracing. FreeSurfer’s hippocampal subfield processing is closer to manual tracings than its standard subcortical segmentation stream. Right hippocampi are also slightly larger according to all methods. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.

Fig 3 FreeSurfer’s overestimate differs with volume and age

Bland-Altman plots show the difference between raw volumes from FreeSurfer 6.0.0’s subcortical segmentation stream and manual tracing on the y-axis. That difference is reduced in larger hippocampi (top) or increasing age (bottom) in both hemispheres.

Fig 4 FreeSurfer’s hippocampal subfield overestimates are smaller, but also differ with volume and age

Bland-Altman plots show the difference between raw volumes from FreeSurfer 6.0.0’s hippocampal subfields and manual tracing on the y-axis. Although there is little difference between subfields and manual tracing, on average, the difference is reduced over size and age similarly to FreeSurfer’s subcortical segmentation stream.

Fig 5 All methods report similar atrophy regardless of size differences

Hippocampal volumes are smaller in older participants than younger, on average, and the relationship between volume and age appears non-linear, steepening with increasing age. Gray dashed lines (labeled at their left edge) represent linear models pooled by method (Trace=Manually traced, Subs=Hippocampal Subfields, 6.0.0=FreeSurfer 6.0.0, 5.3.0=FreeSurfer 5.3.0); solid black lines represent linear models pooled for each age stratum (0–55, 55–70, and 70+) within each method. Gray O’s represent individual FreeSurfer 6.0.0 volumes; black X’s represent individual manually traced volumes; neither hippocampal subfields nor 5.3.0 volumes are plotted individually. In all three age groups, whether using raw values (A) or adjusted to TIV (B), FreeSurfer or manually traced, atrophy rates are shallower or even positive in younger subsamples and steeper in older subsamples. All methods and adjustments are qualitatively consistent regarding atrophy. See Table V for quantitative values.

Fig 6 Quantitative forest plot of calculated annualized atrophy

Atrophy is reported as percentage of tissue lost each year, based on a generalized log-linear model of raw hippocampal volume over age in a cross-sectional sample. Atrophy is shallow or nonexistent in participants under 55 and greater in older strata, as expected, by all methods.
