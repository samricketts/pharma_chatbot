Most of Down syndrome (DS) patients develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.

Methods
Human post-mortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using western blot analysis and RT-qPCR.

Results
Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15–40 years old) and aged (40–65 years old) DS subjects compared to controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 in both hippocampus (n=33, Spearman=−0.59 to −0.38, p≤0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n=57, Spearman=−0.46 to −0.27, p≤0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.

Interpretation
We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD-like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS.


   INTRODUCTION
Down syndrome (DS) is a congenital condition resulting from a partial or complete triplication of chromosome 21 and is the leading cause of genetically defined intellectual disability. Individuals with DS have a significant increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with over 50% of all individuals with DS displaying a classical AD-like neuropathology and cognitive decline1. This increased incidence of AD in DS cases, also known as AD-DS, has primarily been attributed to gene over-dosage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) which is located on HSA21. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to the classical DS neuropathogy remain unclear as the trisomy of chromosome 21 can induce plaque deposition independently of APP triplication2. Similar to AD, enlargement of APP-positive endosomes occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD-DS prior to amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition3,4. In fact, the endo-lysosomal system is the first site of Aβ accumulation in individuals with DS, suggesting that the subcellular localization of APP may be critical during the early stages of AD-DS pathogenesis 2,5.

In AD, endocytic pathway abnormalities have been linked to alterations in endosomal sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in the vacuolar protein sorting system known as the retromer complex. VPS35 and VPS26, two components of the cargo recognition core of the retromer complex, are significantly decreased in the hippocampi of AD patients, and variants of retromer components are associated with an increased risk of developing AD6–9. Loss of function of the retromer complex secondary to its deficiencies in its core components results in enhanced Aβ production, enlargement of early endosomes, and cognitive impairments10,11, while overexpression of VPS35 reduces AD pathology and cognitive impairments in a mouse model of AD12. Given that deficiencies in the retromer complex system are associated with AD pathogenesis, and early endosome enlargement is a key feature of both AD and DS, in the current study we examined the retromer complex in DS using both post-mortem brain tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts from individuals with DS and unaffected controls. For the first time we report that dysregulation of the retromer complex occurs in DS at an early stage in the pathogenesis and the onset of the AD-like pathological phenotype.

METHODS
Human brain samples and fibroblasts
Post-mortem cortex and hippocampus tissues from DS and unaffected matched control (CTR) subjects were obtained from the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank, the University of Miami Brain Endowment Bank, and the Brain Tissue Donation Program at the University of Pittsburg, all repositories of the NIH Neurobiobank. Both males and females were used in the study, and subjects ranged from 15 to 65 years of age. Patient information is listed in Supplemental Table 1.

Cell culture
Human fibroblasts from Down syndrome (AG04823) and control (AG08498) donors were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories and cultured according to the providers protocols (https://catalog.coriell.org/). Cells were harvested at approximately 85–90% confluence and protein was extracted using radioimmiunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX).

Immunoblot analysis
Brain homogenates were extracted using RIPA buffer, as previously described13,14. Briefly, tissue samples were sonicated in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), ultracentrifuged at 90,000 RCF for 45 minutes, and supernatants were used for western blot analysis. Total protein concentration was determined by using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% Bis-Tris gels, then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio‐Rad). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and subsequently with IRDye 800CW‐ or IRDye 680CW‐labeled secondary antibodies (LI‐COR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE) at 22 °C for 1 h. Signals were developed with Odyssey Infrared Imaging Systems (LI‐COR Bioscience). GAPDH was used as an internal loading control. All proteins that were evaluated in this study are analyzed in the results. An internal control was always used in each immunoblot to allow for inter-blot analysis. Additionally, samples from each age group were ran on the same gel (with an internal control) to allow for comparison between groups. The following primary antibodies were used: APP (1:100; Abcam: ab32136), GAPDH (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology: 2118), CI-MPR (cation independent) (1:1000, Abcam: ab124767), Sorla (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology: 79322), VPS26 (1:200; Abcam: ab23892), VPS26b (1:200, Proteintech: 15915–1-AP), VPS29 (1:100, Santa-cruz: 398874), VPS35 (1:200; Abcam: ab10099).

Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR
RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as previously described15. Briefly, 1 ug of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA in a 20 ul reaction using the RT2 First Strand Kit for RT-PCR (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Brain tissue and cell VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29 were amplified using the commercially available primers (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and β-actin was used as an internal control gene. One microliter of cDNA was added to 10ul of SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Each sample was run in triplicate and analysis of relative gene expression was done by StepOne software v2.1. (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Brain homogenates were extracted as previously described with RIPA buffer for the soluble Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 fractions, and formic acid was used for extraction of the insoluble fractions. Soluble and insoluble fractions were assayed using human Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Invitrogen, Carsbad, CA).

Data analyses and Statistical Methods
Descriptive summary data were expressed as counts and percentages for categorical variables and mean±SD/SEM and/or median (range) for continuous variables. Continuous variables that are skewed (e.g., amyloid beta measurements) were transformed using the log function when the normality assumption is violated on the original scale. Spearman correlation coefficient was employed for correlation analyses between the amyloid beta measurements and retromer protein levels. Pairwise group comparisons of retromer proteins and amyloid beta measurements between age (&lt;40 vs. ≥40), brain region (cortex vs. hippocampus), and type of subjects (DS vs. controls) subgroups were performed under the framework of the multivariable mixed-effects regression model approach for each variable of interest in order to take into account of the potential correlation between the observations of the two brain regions from the same subjects included in the study. In particular, all interaction terms between the age, brain region, and type of subjects were included in the model to account for possible heterogeneous effects across different subgroups. Multiple comparison adjusted p-values and simultaneous 95% confidence intervals for the estimated group differences were derived via the Tukey-Kramer method from the multivariable mixed-effects regression model. Note that cause of death differences between DS and controls, the former being largely related to the underlying disease (DS) while the latter not being DS-related at all, could not be accounted for in the regression model due to the complete separation of this variable between the two groups. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Graphpad Prism for Windows version 7.00 were used for all the data analyses.

RESULTS
To assess the retromer complex system in DS, we evaluated retromer proteins in human post-mortem cortex and hippocampus tissues from subjects with DS and unaffected matched controls (Supplemental Table 1). To establish a temporal profile of retromer dysregulation within the context of AD-DS, we examined the retromer core and associated proteins in young patients prior to significant plaque deposition (age 15–40), and older subjects (age 40–65) at a time when virtually all subjects with DS display neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta plaques16. Cortices from the younger subset of DS patients already showed significant dysregulation of retromer recognition core proteins, with VPS26 and VPS29 significantly decreased compared unaffected controls (Fig. 1a, c). Because we observed changes in retromer core proteins, we next assessed additional proteins of the retromer complex system assembly implicated in neurodegenerative disease (Fig. 1a, c). We found that protein levels of Sorla, the endocytic receptor for APP, and CI-MPR, which transports the lysosomal protease Cathepsin D (CTSD), were reduced in cortices from young DS subjects compared to controls, however changes did not reach significance (Fig. 1a, c). In the older subset of patients VPS35 and VPS29 were also significantly decreased in the cortex, however, CI-MPR and Sorla were unchanged (Fig. 1b, d). Similar decreases in retromer complex proteins were observed in the hippocampi of DS subjects. In the young subset of patients, all retromer core proteins were reduced in the hippocampus of DS patients compared to controls, however, but the differences failed to reach significance, possibly due to the smaller sample size of this group compared with cortex (Fig. 2a, c). Significant reductions in all retromer recognition core proteins were also observed in the hippocampi of aged DS subjects compared to matched controls (Fig. 2b, d).

In order to examine differences in both brain regions and age between control and DS subjects, an additional analysis of retromer core proteins was performed between subject type (CTR vs. DS), age group, and brain region (Fig 3, and Supplemental Table 2). Interestingly, it was found that subject type was the largest determining factor for retromer dysregulation, with brain tissue from DS patients having significantly less retromer core proteins than unaffected controls in both young and aged subjects. Brain region was also determined to be a significant factor for protein levels of all three retromer core components, while age was a more significant factor when assessing the cargo receptors CI-MPR and Sorla. Although not all values reached significance, possibly due to the limitations of sample size in several groups, retromer deficiency was more pronounced in hippocampal tissue compared to cortical tissue for all three proteins examined.

Although virtually all patients with DS develop AD-like Aβ neuropathology by age 40, not all subjects may conform to this paradigm. To address this, we examined both soluble and insoluble levels of Aβ peptides in cortex and hippocampus tissue from the subjects in the study. As expected, all forms of Aβ were elevated in cortices and hippocampi of aged subjects with DS compared to younger DS subjects and all control subjects (Table 1). Additionally, the relationship between retromer components and Aβ measurements was analyzed. Retromer core components showed significant inverse correlations with soluble forms of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ1–42 in both hippocampus and cortex tissue (Table 2). On the other hand, several core components showed inverse correlations with the levels of insoluble forms of Aβ peptides although not all correlations with insoluble forms reached significance (Table 2). Representative plots showing Aβ levels as a function of VPS35 optical density in cortex tissue are shown in in Figure 4.

Next, we examined protein levels of the retromer cargo recognition core in fibroblasts derived from human subjects with DS and unaffected controls. Compared to control 2N fibroblasts, DS fibroblasts had significant reductions in all three retromer recognition core proteins: VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29 (Fig. 5a, b). Additionally, we found that protein levels of retromer cargo receptors Sorla and CI-MPR were both significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts compared to 2N fibroblasts. As control, we confirmed that compared to the 2N fibroblast, the ones from DS patients had a significant elevation of total APP (Figure 5a, b).

Since the retromer cargo recognition core proteins, VPS35, VPS29 and VPS26, were decreased in both fibroblasts and brain tissues from DS subjects compared to controls, we next assessed mRNA levels of these proteins to determine whether the decrease was due to differences at the transcriptional regulation level. No differences for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29 mRNA levels were observed when fibroblasts and cortices from DS aged subjects were compared to controls (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
The retromer complex is a highly conserved multiprotein system involved in the sorting and trafficking of intracellular proteins from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network or the cell membrane surface. The mammalian retromer is composed of several modules that define the different functions of the complex. However, the central cargo recognition core (CRC) composed of vacuolar sorting proteins VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29 remains conserved amongst modular assemblies and is considered the backbone of the complex as a whole. The CRC transiently associates with membrane targeting sorting nexin dimers which bind and transport numerous intracellular cargoes, making the retromer CRC a key regulator of cellular proteostasis.

In recent years, studies have implicated dysregulation of the retromer complex in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases9,17. In 2011, a VPS35 mutation causing altered trafficking and impaired alpha-synuclein degradation was identified as the cause of dominant late-onset Parkinson’s disease18. The link to AD first materialized when a model-guided microarray revealed decreased levels of VPS35 and VPS26 in the hippocampi of AD patients6. Further support came from genetic studies associating VPS35 variants with increased risk of developing AD19. This loss of function of the retromer complex was proposed to directly influence AD pathogenesis, in part, by causing retention of the retromer cargo protein, APP, in the endosomes, which results in enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP by β-secretase (BACE-1)17. Several studies have confirmed this notion, showing that deficiency of VPS35 results in increased levels of Aβ and synaptic pathology, while VPS35 overexpression ameliorates the AD phenotype in mouse models of the disease10,12,20.

Despite evidence supporting the role of retromer dysregulation in AD pathogenesis, no data is available on retromer levels in DS. In the present study we show for the first time that the retromer complex is dysregulated in DS and may influence the development of the AD-like amyloidotic phenotype which is typically found in DS. Using both DS post-mortem brain tissues and DS patient-derived fibroblasts, we show that different retromer complex proteins are reduced in DS subjects compared to unaffected matched controls. To start establishing a temporal profile of retromer dysregulation within the context of the evolution of the syndrome, we examined the retromer core and associated proteins in young patients prior to significant plaque deposition (age 15–30), and older subjects (age 40–65) at a time when virtually all subjects with DS display Aβ plaques16. This paradigm was confirmed in our patient cohort through measurements of both soluble and insoluble Aβ 1–40 and Aβ1–42 levels. Retromer CRC proteins VPS35, and VPS29 were significantly decreased in the cortex, and all three CRC proteins were reduced in the hippocampus of the oldest subgroup of DS patients compared to controls. Surprisingly, we found that retromer deficiency was not primarily aging related in DS. Dysregulation of the complex was also observed in younger patient subgroups, suggesting that retromer dysfunction may begin prior to full development of AD-like pathology and cognitive symptoms in the DS population. Interestingly, in both young and aged subjects, retromer depletion was most evident in the hippocampus. This finding underlines the potential role of retromer reduction in AD-like pathogenesis, as the hippocampus is one of the regions most severely affected by AD neuropathology in DS 21,22. In contrast to retromer protein levels, retromer CRC mRNA was unchanged, suggesting a post-translational mechanism of retromer dysregulation in DS.

Additionally, we examined the relationship between retromer protein levels and both soluble and insoluble Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 levels for all subjects. While reduction of retromer proteins seems to precede Aβ deposition, we found that the degree of retromer depletion for all retromer core proteins significantly and inversely correlates with the accumulation of both Aβ peptides in both the cortex and hippocampus. While we recognize that this finding does not indicate causation, we believe that our observation further supports the evidence that retromer dysfunction and neurodegeneration are closely associated.

While it is possible that APP elevations alone may contribute to retromer deficiency by overloading this trafficking system, it should also be considered that an independent mechanism may contribute to this dysfunction. Thus, chromosome 21 is home to several transcription factors and transcription factor binding sites that can lead to broad transcriptional changes 23,24. Although transcription of retromer components appears to be unaffected in DS, proteins involved in retromer regulation or stability could be affected, ultimately affecting retromer protein levels. Additionally, at least 29 microRNAs reside on HSA21, many of which have uncharacterized targets 25. It is possible that these, or other regulatory components of chromosome 21 affect the retromer system leading to the observed decreases in protein.

Traditionally, it has been assumed that AD-DS pathogenesis was principally a result of APP gene overdosage. However, recent studies showing that multiple chromosome 21 genes contribute to increased AD susceptibility independently of APP allow us to speculate that parallel mechanisms of AD pathogenesis may occur in DS 2,26. The converging role of the retromer system in several neurodegenerative diseases suggests that dysfunction of this system may represent a vulnerability that allows for progression to one of several neurodegenerative pathways. In DS, it is conceivable that dysfunction of the retromer system is ultimately what allows for APP overdosage to translate into AD pathogenesis.

The overwhelming incidence of AD in the DS population provides a unique opportunity for the development of preventative treatments for AD. The complexity of AD-DS pathogenesis necessitates whole cell approach, rather than current AD treatments which have been found to be ineffective within the DS population1. In preclinical models of AD, enhancing retromer function has shown promise as an AD therapeutic. We recently demonstrated that restoration of VPS35 levels directly rescues the AD-like phenotype in a mouse model of AD12. Similarly, stabilization of the retromer CRC via a small pharmacological chaperone reduces pathogenic tau phosphorylation independently of APP in a human stem cell model of AD, and a mouse model of AD27, 28. Thus, it is possible that enhancing endocytic trafficking via retromer modulation may independently target both Aβ and tau pathology. Since we found that retromer dysregulation inversely correlates with overt AD-like amyloid pathology in subjects with DS, thus, it is conceivable that targeting the retromer complex may have preventative implications in the treatment of AD-DS.

In summary, our paper is the first to report that compared with healthy controls retromer recognition core and other proteins of the complex system are significantly reduced in both cortices and hippocampi, and fibroblasts from subjects with DS. Our findings further support the importance of this sorting system in cellular proteostasis and provide new evidence that retromer dysfunction may play a functional role in the pathogenesis of AD-DS. We conclude that targeting of the retromer by small pharmacological chaperones, which are known to stabilize and upregulate the complex, should be considered as a novel and viable therapeutic approach against the development of AD-like amylodotic neuropathology in subject with DS.
