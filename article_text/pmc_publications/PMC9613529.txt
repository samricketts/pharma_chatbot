APOE is an immunomodulator in the brain and the major genetic risk factor for late onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Targeted replacement APOE mice (APOE-TR) have been a useful tool to study the effects of APOE isoforms on brain neurochemistry and activity prior to and during AD. We use a newly available APOE knock-in mice (JAX-APOE) to compare phenotypes associated with APOE4 across models. Similar to APOE4-TR mice, JAX-E4 mouse brains showed 27% lower levels of APOE protein compared to JAX-E3 (p&lt;0.001). We analyzed several neuroinflammatory molecules that have been associated with APOE genotype. SerpinA3 was much higher in APOE4-TR mice to APOE3-TR mice, but this effect was not seen in JAX-APOE mice. There were higher levels of IL-3 in JAX-E4 brains compared to JAX-E3, but other neuroinflammatory markers (IL6, TNFα) were not affected by APOE genotype. In terms of neuronal structure, basal dendritic spine density in the entorhinal cortex was 39% lower in JAX-E4 mice compared to JAX-E3 mice (p&lt;0.001), again similar to APOE-TR mice. One-week treatment with ibuprofen significantly increased dendritic spine density in the JAX-E4 mice, consistent with our previous finding in APOE-TR mice. Behaviorally, there was not an effect of APOE genotype on Barnes Maze learning and memory in six-month old JAX-APOE mice. Overall, the experiments performed in JAX-APOE mice validated findings from APOE-TR mice, identifying particularly strong effects of APOE4 genotype on lower APOE protein levels and simplified neuron structure. These data demonstrate pathways that could promote susceptibility of APOE4 brains to AD pathological changes.

Graphical Abstract

We compared phenotypes associated with APOE4 in two targeted replacement APOE mouse model, APOE-TR and JAX-APOE mice. APOE4 genotype results in reduced APOE protein levels, altered inflammatory markers at baseline, and simplified dendritic spine density compared to APOE3 across model. One week Ibuprofen treatment restored dendritic spine in APOE4 mice. We conclude that the strongest effects of APOE4 genotype are decreased APOE protein levels and simplified neuron structure, pathways that promote brain susceptibility to AD


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized most prominently by learning and memory deficits (Mattson, 2004). The ε4 allele of the APOE gene is the strongest genetic risk factor of late-onset AD, increasing risk of AD by three-fold in ε4 heterozygous individuals and twelve-fold in homozygous individuals (Bertram et al., 2007). Compared to APOE2 and APOE3, the APOE4 isoform significantly reduces the clearance of Amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain (Baek et al., 2020; Jansen et al., 2015; Rebeck et al., 1993) and exacerbates tau pathology (Baek et al., 2020; Farfel et al., 2016; Hohman et al., 2018). Thus, studying how APOE4 genotype mediates AD pathology might identify therapeutic targets for sporadic AD.

Targeted replacement APOE mice, in which the murine APOE gene is replaced with one of the human APOE alleles, were developed in 1997 (Raffaï et al., 2001; Sullivan et al., 1997). Targeting constructs contained the human coding sequences (exons 2–4) for either APOE2, APOE3, or APOE4, as well as a murine flanking sequence. The resulting mouse chimeras were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice (Knouff et al., 1999; Sullivan et al., 1997). Since this model expresses human APOE protein at physiological levels and conserves the endogenous regulatory sequence of APOE expression, it allows the controlled comparison of APOE genotype specific effects in vivo. This mouse model is commonly used to study the function APOE protein prior and during AD neuropathology. In these models without pathological changes, APOE4 protein is present at lower levels than APOE3 (Riddell et al., 2008), and it has altered post-translational modification (DiBattista et al., 2016). APOE4 is associated with increased basal expression of some pro-inflammatory molecules (Fernandez et al., 2019; C.-C. Liu et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2020). APOE4 mice show simplification in neuronal dendritic arborization and reduced dendritic spine density in the amygdala (Wang et al., 2005a), cortex (Dumanis et al., 2009; Neustadtl et al., 2017), hippocampus (Maezawa et al., 2006), and entorhinal cortex (DiBattista et al., 2016; Rodriguez et al., 2013). The APOE4 mice also show altered behavior compared to APOE3 mice in learning and spatial memory (Bour et al., 2008; Rodriguez et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2005b). In the APOE model crossed to amyloid models, APOE4 is associated with accelerated Aβ accumulation (Tai et al., 2014; Youmans et al., 2012), neuronal inflammation (C. G. Fernandez et al., 2019; Tai et al., 2014) and cognitive decline (D. Liu et al., 2015).

While APOE targeted replacement mice have been a critical tool to study APOE isoform specific effects on brain structure, activity, and neurochemistry, studying the effects the APOE genotype in a different mouse model allows identification of which phenotypes are the strongest and most reproducible. In the current study, we compared measurements associated APOE risk in previously used the human APOE targeted replacement model (APOE3-TR and APOE4-TR) (Sullivan et al., 1997) with a model developed more recently (Foley et al., 2022) and distributed by Jackson Laboratory (JAX-E3 and JAX-E4). We used the JAX-APOE mice to measure the levels and distribution of APOE protein in the brain and levels of proinflammatory cytokines. We tested whether APOE4 was associated with neuronal simplification and behavioral differences. These findings thus identified several key phenotypes associated with APOE4 genotype that serve as robust biomarkers of APOE4-associated risk of AD across mouse models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals.

We used 6 months old male and female APOE3KI (JAX Stock No. 029018) and APOE4KI (JAX Stock No. 027894) mice commercially available from Jackson laboratories (referred as JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 in this study), and C57BL/6J APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice under the murine APOE promoter (the kind gift of Patrick Sullivan) (Sullivan et al., 1997) (referred in this study as APOE3-TR and APOE4-TR). Mice were in housed in cages with littermates, kept on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to chow and water. For analysis of the effects of ibuprofen treatment, JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 animals were fed control chow regularly (Purina Rodent Chow, #5001, C11000; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ), or control chow containing 375 ppm ibuprofen (C126940) at six months of age for one week. Sample sizes were included in the figure legend. All studies were carried out following the Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals as adopted by the U.S. National Institute of Health and approved by Georgetown University Animal Care and Use Committee, approval protocol 2016-1160.

Tissue collection.

Mice were euthanized with CO2, intracardially perfused with 0.1M phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4), and then the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were dissected. Tissue was serially homogenized in Tris buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) and TBS with 1% Triton-X (TBSX, pH 7.4) (100mg of tissue per ml of buffer) as previously described (DiBattista et al., 2016). Briefly, brain material was homogenized in TBS, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientific™ Pierce™ Cat. No. A32959) at 4°C using a Dounce homogenizer. A small faction of homogenate was set aside for preparing total protein homogenate in RIPA buffer (0.5M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1.5M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid, 10% NP-40, 10mM EDTA. Cat. No. 20–188, Millipore) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The remaining initial homogenate was centrifuged at 47,000 rpm at 4°C for 45 min, and supernatant was collected as the TBS fraction. TBSX buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor was added to insoluble pellets, these homogenates were sonicated for 10 sec, and centrifuged at 47,000 rpm at 4°C for 45 min; the supernatant solution was collected as the TBSX fraction. An Optima TLX centrifuge with a TLA 120.2 rotor (Beckman) was used for high-speed centrifugation. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Cat. No. 23227). For analysis of the effects of ibuprofen treatment, brain hemisections were flash frozen and cryo-pulverized in with liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle (Coors porcelain mortar and pestle 522-00). Pulverized tissue was used for subsequent protein and RNA extraction. The remaining hemisections were used for Golgi staining (see below).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

APOE protein levels were determined using the Human Apolipoprotein E ELISA kit (Cat. No. ab108813, Abcam) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Homogenates were diluted to 2μg/μl, and 10μl were loaded per well. Absorbance was measured at 450nm using SpectraMax iD3 microplate reader. APOE protein concentration was determined against a seven-point standard curve. Total levels of APOE in brain tissues were determined from the RIPA fractions. The quantity of APOE was expressed as the total amount of APOE protein (μg) over the total amount of total protein (mg). This sample size (n= 4–7 mice per group) gives 80% power to observe difference of 27% given the variance observed in previous work (Lanfranco et al., 2021). The percentage of TBS APOE was expressed as the amount of TBS soluble APOE over the amount of APOE detected in the TBS plus the TBSX fractions.

Western Blot.

The TBS and TBSX cortical homogenates (20 or 50 μg) were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 4°C. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS-0.5% tween-20 (PBS-T) and were probed overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation in the following antibodies: polyclonal goat anti-APOE (1:2000, Cat. No. K74190G, Meridian Life Science, Inc), monoclonal mouse anti-APOE4 (1:1000, Cat. No. NBP1-49529SS, Novus Biologicals), polyclonal goat anti-APOJ (1:1000, Cat. No. 600-101-198, Rockland Immunochemical, Inc.), polyclonal rabbit anti-APOA1 (1:1000, Cat. No. PA5-78798, Invitrogen), polyclonal rabbit anti-Perilipin 4 (1:1000, Cat. No. NBP2-13776, Novus Biologicals), and rabbit polyclonal β-actin (1:2000, Cat. No. ab8227, Abcam). β-actin was used for western blot normalization. After three washing steps with PBS-T, immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000) and chemiluminescence detection using SuperSignal™ West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Cat. No. 37071, ThermoFisher Sientific, Inc) and imaged via Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare).

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).

Total cortical RNA from 8 month old mice (APOE3-TR n=6, APOE4-TR n=6, JAX-E3 n=5, JAX-E4 n=5) was isolated using TRIzol™ Plus RNA Purification Kit (Cat. No. 12183555, Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Cat. No. 4368814, Applied Biosystems). cDNA (1:50 dilution, 4μl) and amplified by real-time PCR using PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (Cat. No. A25742, Applied Biosystem). Samples were standardized to GAPDH. Synthetic oligonucleotides were used for mouse Serpina3n (forward: 5’CCCTGAGGAAGTGGAAGAAT-3’ and reverse: 5’-CCTGATG CCCAGCTTTGAAA-3’), mouse TNFα (forward: 5’-GGTGCCTATGTC TCAGCCTCTT−3’ and reverse: 5’-GCCATAGAACTGATGAGAGGG AG-3’), mouse IL6 (forward: 5’-ACGGCCTTCCCTACTTCACA-3’and reverse: 5’-CATTTCCACGATTTCCCAGA-3’), mouse IL3 (forward: 5’-CCTGGGACTCCAAGCTTCAA-3’ and reverse 5’-GACAATAGAGCTGCAATTCAACGT-3’), and mouse GAPDH (forward: 5’-GTGTTTCCTCGTCCCGTAGA-3’ and reverse 5’-ATTCCGTTCACACCGACCTT-3’). Samples were analyzed in triplicate and RNA levels were reported as fold change compared to control (APOE3-TR or JAX-E3). Resulting data were analyzed using the double delta CT method (Livak &amp; Schmittgen, 2001). For analysis of inflammation by qRT-PCR, the samples size (n= 5–6 brains per group) gives 80% power to observe difference of 46% in IL-3 transcriptional levels given the variance observed in our earlier work (Jones et al., 2021).

Golgi staining.

Brain hemisections of PBS-perfused brains were placed in Golgi staining solution following FD Rapid GolgiStain™ Kit protocol (Cat. No. PK401A, FD NeuroTechnologies, Inc) and sliced at 150μm. Pyramidal neurons in the medial enthorhinal cortex were imaged using Zeiss AxioSkop microscope at 63x magnification with oil immersion. Dendritic spines along apical oblique dendrites (20 micron lengths) and basal shaft dendrites (10 micron lengths) were counted in a blinded manner. Dendritic spine density was measured as spine counts divided by the length of the dendritic segment. Dendritic lengths and spines were measured using image J. A minimum of 6 neurons were imaged for each mouse, and 5 to 6 animals were used from each cohort. For quantification of dendritic spine density, this sample size (n= 5 mice per group) gives 80% power to observe difference of 39% in dendritic spine density, given the variance observe in our previous studies (DiBattista et al., 2016)

Behavioral Assessments.

6 months old JAX-E3 (n = 15, 7 females, 8 males) and JAX-E4 (n = 19, 11 females, 8 males) mice were tested during daytime of the light/dark cycle. using a series of behavioral assessments, using two cohorts of mice containing both genotypes. Prior to each assessment, mice were habituated to the testing room for 30 minutes in their home cage. The apparatuses were cleaned with 70% ethanol in between trials. Barnes Maze assessment was performed in the morning whereas Open Field and Elevated Zero was assessed in the afternoon.

The Barnes Maze for spatial learning and memory consists of 19 decoy holes and 1 escape hole. The space contained 4 extra-maze visual cues, bright light (150 lux) and white noise (75 dB). For each trial, the mouse was placed in the center of the maze and allowed to freely explore for 180 seconds or until it entered the escape hole. If the mouse did not enter the escape hole by the end of the trial, it was guided to the escape hole by the experimenter. Before the first training day, a habituation task was performed where mice ran one trial with the escape hole located in a spot different from that of the training day trials. On each of the 4 consecutive training days, mice completed 4 trials, each separated by a 15-minute interval. 72-hours following the completion of the last training day trial, mice underwent a probe test that consisted of a single trial with the escape hole located in the same place as in the training days. One JAX-E3 mouse was excluded from the analysis due to abnormal behavior during training days. Video capture and analysis was done using AnyMaze tracking software.

The Open Field assessment of locomotion, anxiety, and exploratory behaviors consists of a square field of 43 cm2. The outermost 8 cm of the field was considered the “outer zone”, while the remaining region was denoted the “inner zone”. The percentage of time spent in the inner zone and distance traveled were recorded.

The Elevated Zero is a ring-shaped platform 600 mm in diameter, with two opposing sections of the ring protected by 6” high walls. The percentage of time spent in the protected and unprotected sections was recorded. Mice were assessed on the Open Field and Elevated Zero one week following the completion of the 72-hour probe trial of the Barnes Maze.

Statistical analyses.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software (San Diego, CA, USA) with p&lt;0.05 considered as statistically significant. Normality of each of the data sets shown here was demonstrated by Shapiro-Wilk test. Data was statistically analyzed by Two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test (dendritic spine quantification), and by Two tailed Student’s t-tests (APOE ELISA, qPCR, Western blot, open field, and behavioral analysis data), to compare the effects of treatment on APOE-associated phenotype of interest. No exclusion criteria were predetermined and no data outliers were excluded.

RESULTS

APOE genotype affects brain APOE protein levels.

APOE genotype affects levels of brain APOE in humans and mice (Bertrand et al., 1995; Glöckner et al., 2002; Raffaï et al., 2001). We analyzed whether JAX-E3 (JE3) and JAX-E4 (JE4) mice also supported this association as previously reported in the APOE-TR mice. We measured the levels of APOE protein in total cortical homogenate of JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 mice by densitometry of western blot (Figure 1A). JAX-E4 mice had 49% lower APOE levels relative to JAX-E3 mice (100%± 8.1 in JAX-E3 n=9 vs 51%± 8.4 in JAX-E4 n=9, t=4.2, df= 16, p=0.0007). As a more quantitative approach, we used ELISA to measure cortical APOE levels (Figure 1B). Again, JAX-E4 mice had significantly lower levels of cortical APOE (mean=0.11μg/mg ± 0.005, t=4.8, df= 17, p=0.0001, n=9) relative to JAX-E3 mice (mean=0.15μg/mg ± 0.004, n = 10), a 27% lower level. The levels of brain APOE were unaffected by sex (Figure 1C).

To test whether there were APOE-genotype dependent differences in APOE solubility characteristics, we measured cortical APOE protein levels in JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 mice using a sequential brain fraction method (DiBattista et al., 2016; Youmans et al., 2012). We isolated APOE as Tris buffered saline (TBS) soluble and TBS with 1% Triton X (TBSX) soluble fractions (Figure 1D and 1E). We found JAX-E3 brains had significantly more TBSX soluble APOE (mean= 0.17 μg/mg, p&lt;0.0001, t=9.9, df= 17, n=10) relative to JE4 (mean= 0.09 μg/mg, n=9) (Figure 1E); there was also a modest, statistically non-significant trend of more TBS soluble APOE in JAX-E3 brains (Figure 1D, p=0.06). To determine the distribution of APOE, we calculated the amount of TBS or TBSX soluble APOE relative to total (TBS + TBSX) and found that in JAX-E3 brains 84% of APOE is soluble in TBS soluble, whereas in JE4 89.5% of total APOE is TBS soluble (84.0%± 0.8 in JAX-E3 n=10 vs 89.5%± 0.48 in JAX-E4 n=9, t=5.5, df= 17, p&lt;0.0001) (Figure 1F).

Modified APOE protein isoforms are TBS Soluble.

The solubilities of APOE in the TBS and TBSX buffers are modified by post-translational modifications (Flowers &amp; Rebeck, 2020). O-linked glycosylation can increase the apparent molecular weight of APOE, and proteolytic cleavage can lower the molecular weight (Flowers et al., 2020; Lanfranco et al., 2021). We used SDS-PAGE to determine the migration pattern of TBS and TBSX fraction from JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 cortical homogenates. APOE protein in the TBS fraction was characterized by a double band in which APOE is found as a 34-KDa protein and as a less prominent protein of slightly higher molecular weight. In contrast, APOE in the TBSX fraction demonstrates a 34-KDa band and proteins of lower molecular weights (Figure 2A). These data suggests that glycosylated APOE is fully soluble in TBS, and that TBSX-soluble forms of APOE include some membrane bound, cleaved forms of APOE. An APOE4-specific antibody also identified the various APOE bands in the JAX-E4, but not JAX-E3, samples, demonstrating that they each contain the Arg-112 residue that defines APOE4 compared to APOE3 (Figure 2A). To determine whether APOE genotype affects post-translational changes in APOE protein, we compared the percentage of the upper band relative to the total APOE duplet. We found that APOE genotype did not affect the percentage of the upper band relative to the double band signal (Figure 2B).

In order to define the characteristics of proteins isolated in the TBS and TBSX fractions, we probed them for other APOE-associated proteins. In addition to APOE, brain lipoproteins contain other apolipoproteins such as APOJ and APOA1 (Koch et al., 2017; Lambert et al., 2009; Saunders et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 2019). APOE also interacts with lipid droplets (LD) that contain Perilipins (C. G. Fernandez et al., 2019; L. Liu et al., 2015, 2017). We sought to determine extraction buffer recovered the proteins associated with lipoproteins and LD. We found that Perilipin-4, APOA1 and APOJ are each present in the TBS and not the TBSX fractions (Figure 2C).

Inflammatory genes are differentially affected by APOE genotype in APOE-TR mice and JAX-APOE mice.

APOE acts as an immunomodulator in the brain, and the presence of APOE4 confers an increase of proinflammatory cytokines in both rodents and humans (C. G. Fernandez et al., 2019; C.-C. Liu et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2020). We examined whether genes related to neuroinflammation are regulated in APOE-TR mice and JAX-APOE mice at baseline in a genotype dependent manner. We extracted cortical mRNA from 6 months old APOE-TR mice (E3 and E4) and JAX-APOE mice (JE3 and JE4) and measured several inflammatory markers: Serpin3A, TNFα, IL3, and IL6. In a previous non-directed analysis of mRNA, Serpin3A showed one of the most pronounced differences between APOE3-TR and APOE4-TR mice (Zhao et al., 2020); we similarly observed that Serpin3A was eightfold higher in APOE4-TR mice compared to APOE3-TR mice (Figure 3A, t=19.4, df= 10, p&lt;0.0001). However, this effect of APOE genotype was not exhibited in JAX-APOE mice, which showed equivalent levels between the genotypes. IL3 levels are significantly higher in JAX-E4 mice compared to JAX-E3 (t=3.7, df= 8, p=0.0062, Figure 3C). For TNFα and IL6, there were not differences by genotype in APOE-TR and JAX-APOE mice, although there were trends for higher levels in APOE4-TR mice but not JAX-E4 for each of these (Figure 3B and D). APOE transcript levels were measured in both APOE-TR mice and JAX-APOE mice and there was not significant difference by genotype in both models, in agreement with previous work (Bales et al., 2009).

JAX-E4 mice have reduced dendritic spine density, which is rescued by anti-inflammatory treatment.

APOE4 is associated with less neuronal dendritic arborization and lower dendritic spine density in the amygdala (Wang et al., 2005a), hippocampus (Maezawa et al., 2006), neocortex (Dumanis et al., 2009; Neustadtl et al., 2017) and entorhinal cortex (DiBattista et al., 2016; Rodriguez et al., 2013). We investigated whether JE4 mice exhibited a similar phenotype with respect to dendritic spine density. We quantified apical and basal dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons from the medial entorhinal cortex (Figure 4B). JAX-E4 mice had a significantly lower dendritic spine density in basal dendrites (39%) relative to JAX-E3 mice (f(1,20)=7.4, df= 20, p=0.0004, Figure 4C). No significant difference in the apical dendritic spine density was detected (Figure 4C). We previously found that treatment with ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), increased the number of dendritic spines in APOE4-TR mice (DiBattista et al., 2016). To test whether ibuprofen could rescue this phenotype in JAX-APOE4 mice, we treated 6 moths old JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 mice with 375ppm ibuprofen for one week (Figure 4A), as we had done previously (DiBattista et al., 2016). Ibuprofen restored JAX-E4 dendritic spine density to that of JAX-E3 mice (f(1,20)=16.1, df= 20, p=0.003, Figure 4C). These findings support the previous findings that simplification of dendritic spine is APOE genotype dependent and is immunomodulated.

To determine the mechanism by which ibuprofen restores dendritic spine density in JAX-E4 animals we measured protein and mRNA levels of APOE in the brain, as well as the levels of important inflammatory mediators. As determined by ELISA, one week ibuprofen treatment did not affect APOE3 or APOE4 protein levels. Ibuprofen treatment also did not alter the levels of APOE3 or APOE4 mRNA as determined by qRT-PCR (data not shown). To determine the effects of ibuprofen on the expression of inflammatory mediators we measure the transcriptional levels of serpinA3, TNFα, IL3, and IL6 as above. Ibuprofen treatment did not affect these markers of neuroinflammation in either JAX-E3 or JAX-E4 mice (data not shown).

Spatial learning is not influenced by APOE genotype in JAX-APOE mice.

Six-month-old JAX-E3 (n = 15, 7 females, 8 males) and JAX-E4 (n = 19, 11 females, 8 males) mice were analyzed for exploratory and anxiety behaviors, as well as for learning and memory (Figure 5A). In the Open Field task, no differences in inner zone time (unpaired t-test, p = 0.97) and distance traveled (unpaired t-test, p = 0.076) were noted between genotypes in the Open Field test (Figure 5B). These findings were corroborated by the Elevated Zero open arm time (unpaired t-test, p = 0.80) and distance traveled (unpaired t-test, p = 0.31) (Figure 5C). In the Barnes Maze, across training days (TDs), both cohorts demonstrated similar latencies to escape (defined as the time it took for the mouse to completely enter the escape hole), indicating that APOE genotype does not affect spatial learning. No significant differences were seen between JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 mice on TD1, TD2, TD4 and the 72-hour probe (unpaired t-test, p = 0.72), although a small but significant difference was detected on TD3 (adjusted pTD3 = 0.046) (Figure 5D). Similarly, APOE genotype did not affect the latency to escape during the probe trial 3 days following TD4. Since APOE genotype is known to have sex-dependent effects, we examined whether sex affected latency to escape in the Barnes Maze on the final training day. No differences were observed by sex: JAX-E4 male vs JAX-E4 female (adjusted p = 0.77), and JAX-E3 male vs JAX-E3 female (adjusted p = 0.90) (Figure 5E).

DISCUSSION

Understanding how APOE genotype affects AD risk has benefitted greatly from mouse models with physiological expression of human APOE alleles. Accumulating evidence from these studies suggest that APOE4 genotype affects basal levels of APOE protein in the brain (Riddell et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2011), impairs neuronal morphology in the entorhinal cortex (DiBattista et al., 2016), dysregulates cytokine levels (Vitek et al., 2009), and causes behavioral deficits (Boehm-Cagan &amp; Michaelson, 2014; Rodriguez et al., 2013; Salomon-Zimri et al., 2014; Speidell et al., 2019). In the current study, we found that reduced brain APOE levels and simplification of dendritic spines are particularly strong phenotypes in APOE4 carriers, being observed in both APOE-TR mice and JAX-APOE mice. In addition, treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen modifies structural changes in JAX-E4 mice brains to be more like JAX-E3 mice, another APOE-related phenotype that is present in both mouse models (DiBattista et al., 2016). By examining young APOE4 brains using JAX-APOE mice, we identified phenotypes that are consistent with APOE-TR mice, further supporting conclusions that APOE genotype affects brain metabolism in the absence of AD pathology.

Compared to JAX-E3, JAX-E4 brains showed significantly less total APOE protein (Figure 1). APOE is synthetized in the ER and transported through the Golgi apparatus, during which APOE protein is glycosylated and sialylated. After these modifications, APOE is moved across the tubular vesicular compartment to the plasma membrane for subsequent secretion (Kockx et al., 2018). This model is supported by the observation that post-translationally modified APOE is extracted in TBS and not in TBSX (which would solubilize membrane bound proteins) (DiBattista et al., 2016; Lanfranco et al., 2021). Other apolipoproteins are found in this TBS fraction, demonstrating further that it extracts the brain lipoproteins. The TBSX extraction recovered fragmented forms of APOE. An ionic interaction between Arg-61 in the N-terminal domain and Glu-255 in the C-terminal domain in APOE4 isoform promotes the misfolding of APOE protein (Mahley, 2016; Mahley &amp; Rall Jr, 2000; Wilson et al., 1991, 1994). These observations led to the hypothesis that misfolded APOE accumulates in the ER and is trafficked through a proteolytic degradation pathway, decreasing the overall APOE abundance in the brain. These processes may occur in the APOE that is more membrane-associated.

Cell culture and mouse models show that APOE is an immune modulator in the CNS (Laskowitz et al., 2006, 2010; Vitek et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2020). We examined several inflammatory molecules linked to APOE genotype. APOE4 mice show higher levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα in a model where APOE expression was inducible (C.-C. Liu et al., 2017). APOE4-TR mice show higher basal levels of serpin3A relative to APOE3-TR (Zhao et al., 2020); Serpin3A encodes for the inflammatory protein α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) overexpressed in AD brains (Padmanabhan et al., 2006). The disparity of serpin3A expression between the two APOE mouse models is particularly strong, given the magnitude of the effect of APOE4 in APOE-TR mice, one of the most prominent differences observed in a global RNASeq analysis of brain mRNA (Zhao et al., 2020). Increased plasma levels of IL-3, a protein associated with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, are observed in humans carrying APOE ε4 (Mindur &amp; Swirski, 2019; Soares et al., 2012). We found that JAX-E4 mice have higher basal levels of brain IL-3, supporting the model that APOE4 predisposes the brain to greater inflammatory response. However, in these mice, we did not observe effects of APOE genotype on mRNA levels of TNFα, IL6, and serpinA3. Although both APOE knock-in models show basal inflammation differences due to APOE genotype, there is inconsistency about which specific pathways are most affected, both across models and within models across studies. It is possible that the lower levels of APOE protein in APOE4 animals contributes to the dysregulation of inflammation, and those effects may depend on characteristics of individual colonies of APOE knock-in mice.

In humans without signs of AD, APOE genotypes have been associated with differences in brain activity and brain connectivity. fMRI studies have shown prominent differences in the default mode network of individuals carrying the APOE ε4 allele (Filippini et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2017). Diffusion Tensor Imaging studies measuring fractional anisotropy and white mater intensities have found that white matter structures are impaired in APOE4 carriers (Heise et al., 2011; Lyall et al., 2020; Westlye et al., 2012). These studies support a model in which APOE genotype affects the complexity of neuronal connections. Preclinical support for this model is found in several studies that have documented fewer dendritic spines (DiBattista et al., 2016; Dumanis et al., 2009) and simplified neuronal arborization (Wang et al., 2005b) in APOE4-TR mice. In this study, we found that the JAX-E4 mice also have a lower dendritic spine density than JAX-E3 mice. The agreement of these two APOE mouse models supports the conclusion that APOE4 is associated with fewer synaptic connections even in the absence of AD pathology.

The use of NSAIDs is associated with significantly lower risks of AD, as defined in several epidemiological studies, especially with the NSAID ibuprofen (Etminan et al., 2003; Szekely et al., 2008; Vlad et al., 2008). These types of studies are limited in being able to address conditions of causality compared to correlation (Breitner et al., 2009). Clinical trials using NSAIDs have shown no efficacy in the treatment of AD (Pasqualetti et al., 2009) or the prevention of AD in individuals within two years of disease onset (Meyer et al., 2019). These findings suggest that NSAID treatment might only be effective prior the development of AD pathology. In this study on JAX-APOE mice, treatment with ibuprofen for 1 weeks significantly increased the number of dendritic spines in JAX-E4 mice (Figure 4), which reproduces our previous study of the effects of ibuprofen on APOE-TR mice (DiBattista et al., 2016). The efficacy of an anti-inflammatory treatment at promoting neuronal complexity in mouse models suggests that chronic inflammation could contribute to brain simplification and risk of neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that differences in neuroinflammation between APOE genotypes underlies the differences observed in dendritic spine density. Further research is needed to identify the neuroinflammatory genes that vary across APOE genotypes, and the effects of NSAIDs on their expression.

Behavioral differences between APOE3-TR and APOE4-TR mice have been observed across many domains and at many labs. Compared to APOE3 mice, APOE4 have been shown to have deficits in fear conditioning (Boehm-Cagan &amp; Michaelson, 2014; Salomon-Zimri et al., 2014), open field (Siegel et al., 2012), novel object recognition (Boehm-Cagan &amp; Michaelson, 2014; Salomon-Zimri et al., 2014), Barnes Maze (Rodriguez et al., 2013; Speidell et al., 2019), and Morris Water Maze (Boehm-Cagan &amp; Michaelson, 2014; Bour et al., 2008; Salomon-Zimri et al., 2014). Some behavioral differences were not observed in younger mice but only in older mice (Andrews-Zwilling et al., 2010; Bour et al., 2008). We report here that six month old JAX-APOE mice and APOE-TR mice differ in their behavior on the Barnes Maze. Although we did not run APOE-TR mice in this study, previous findings from our lab have consistently shown that six and twelve month old APOE4-TR mice perform significantly worse than APOE3-TR mice on the Barnes Maze (Demby et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2013; Speidell et al., 2019). We only tested JAX-APOE mice at one age (6 months) and on a small number of behavioral tasks; a comprehensive battery of tests at several ages should be done to determine which behaviors are most affected by APOE genotypes. Behavioral differences based on APOE genotype may be dependent on characteristics of animal colonies and specifics of behavioral assays across labs. However, even these behaviors provide opportunities for demonstrating how specific drugs or treatments may affect behavior in genotype-specific ways within APOE mouse colonies. For example, we have reported that an anthracycline, doxorubicin, impaired Barnes Maze behavior only in APOE4 mice (Demby et al., 2020; Speidell et al., 2019), supporting the sensitivity of APOE4 individuals to cognitive-impairment related to cancer chemotherapy (H. R. Fernandez et al., 2020; Grootendorst et al., 2005).

CONCLUSION

Here we compare two different preclinical models to determine which are the strongest phenotypes associated with APOE4 as risk factor for AD. We determined that APOE-ε4 effects on lower APOE protein levels, dysregulated baseline inflammation, and decreased dendritic spine density are the common phenotypes across models. Future studies with the JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 mice would provide more information on the effects of APOE genotype on homeostatic mechanisms in a cell type specific manner prior AD pathology. These studies will help define the most important molecular mechanisms that could be used in therapeutic approaches to reduce the risk of AD.

Figure 1. APOE levels are lower in total homogenate and TBSX fraction in 8 months old JAX-E4 mouse cortex.

Total homogenate (A, B, and C), TBS (D), and TBSX (E) fraction were isolated from cortex of JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 (JE3 and JE4). Lysates were analyzed by western blotting (A) or ELISA (B, C, and D). Percentage TBS soluble APOE was calculated by the concentration of TBS soluble APOE over total APOE (TBS plus TBSX soluble APOE) (F). Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM (n= 10 JE3; n= 9 JE4), n = number of animals. A two-tailed student t-test was used to assess the outcome measures from genotype (A, B, D, E, and F) and a two-way ANOVA was used to assess the outcome measures from genotype and sex (C). *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.

Figure 2. Forms of brain APOE differ between soluble and membrane-bound fractions.

Western blot analysis of cortical brain fractions demonstrated brain APOE from JAX-E3 (JE3) and JAX-E4 (JE4) as a doublet in the TBS fraction as a serious of full-length and smaller bands in the TBSX fraction (A). Double band from TBS and TBSX fraction were quantified and expressed as percentage of upper bands with respect of total APOE detected (B). Western blot of cortical TBS and TBSX fractions showed the TBS fraction contains proteins in lipid droplets (Perilipin 4), and in brain lipoproteins (APOA1, and APOJ) (C). Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM (n= 6 JE3; n= 6 JE4), n = number of animals. A two-tailed student t-test was used to assess outcome from percentage of upper band in TBS and TBSX soluble APOE.

Figure 3. APOE-TR mice and JAX-APOE mice show activation of different inflammatory markers at baseline.

Inflammatory markers serpinA3 (A), TNFα (B), IL3 (C), and IL6 (D) were measured from cortical mRNA using qRT-PCR. Levels of transcripts from APOE-TR (E3 and E4) and JAX-APOE (JE3 and JE4) mice were determined by the double delta CT method, with APOE3 defined as 100% in both APOE-TR and JAX-APOE mice. Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM (n= 6 E3; n= 6 E4; n= 6 JE3; n= 6 JE4), n = number of animals. Two-tailed student t-tests were used to compare fold differences in gene expression. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.

Figure 4. Reduced dendritic spine density in JAX-E4 entorhinal cortex is reversed with ibuprofen treatment.

Six-month-old JAX-E3 (JE3) and JAX-E4 (JE4) were treated with control diets or 375 ppm ibuprofen for one week and dendritic spines were quantified (A). Representative of Golgi stained apical and basal dendrites in the medial entorhinal cortex (B). Quantification of the basal and apical spine density, based on counts of two apical and basal dendrites per brain slice and three slices per brain, presented as an average for each mouse (C). Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM (control diet n = 6 JE3; n = 6 JE4, and ibuprofen diet n = 5 JE3; n = 6 JE4), n = number of animals. Two-way ANOVA was used to assess outcome measures from genotype and pharmacological manipulation. Tukey multiple comparison post-hoc analyses, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.

Figure 5. APOE genotype does not affect spatial learning and memory in JAX-APOE mice.

Timeline for the behavioral probes (A). In an Open Field task, JAX-E3 and JAX-E4 (JE3 and JE4) mice were measured for the percentage of time spent in the center of the field (left panel) and the total distance traveled (B). The time spent in the open arms of the Elevated Zero maze were measured, as well as total distance traveled in that apparatus (C). No significant differences by APOE genotype were noted. Spatial learning was assessed on the Barnes Maze across four training days, measuring the time to identifying and entering the escape hole (in seconds). A significant difference (p=0.046) was noted between APOE genotypes at training day 3, but not at any other timepoint (D). Memory of the escape hole was measured in a 72 hour probe trial, with no observed difference between JE3 and JE4 mice. No differences in latency to escape were noted between male and female mice at training day 4 (E). Bar graphs represent the mean ± SEM (n= 15 JE3; n= 19 JE4), n = number of animals. A two-tailed student t-test was used to assess the outcome measures from genotype (B and C). Barnes Maze and Male vs Female data were compared using multiple unpaired t-tests with Holm-Sidak correction for multiple comparisons, *adjusted p = 0.046. Data were compared using an unpaired t-test for the 72 hour probe, open field, and elevated zero tests.
