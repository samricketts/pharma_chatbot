Background:

Emerging evidence demonstrates association of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with impaired delivery of blood oxygen and nutrients to and throughout the brain. The cerebral circulation plays multiple roles underscoring optimal brain perfusion and cognition entailing moment-to-moment blood flow control, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis. With currently no effective treatment to prevent or delay the progression of AD, cerebrovascular microRNA (miRNA) markers corresponding to post-transcriptional regulation may distinguish phases of AD.

Objective:

We tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular miRNA expression profiles indicate developmental stages of AD pathology.

Methods:

Total RNA was isolated from total brain vessel segments of male and female 3xTg-AD mice [young, 1–2 mo; cognitive impairment (CI), 4–5 mo; extracellular amyloid-β plaques (Aβ), 6–8 mo; plaques+neurofibrillary tangles (AβT), 12–15 mo]. NanoString technology nCounter miRNA Expression panel for mouse was used to screen for 599 miRNAs.

Results:

Significant (p &lt; 0.05) downregulation of various miRNAs indicated transitions from young to CI (e.g., let-7g &amp; miR-1944, males; miR-133a &amp; miR-2140, females) and CI to Aβ (e.g., miR-99a, males) but not from Aβ to AβT. In addition, altered expression of select miRNAs from overall Pre-AD (young + CI) versus AD (Aβ + AβT) were detected in both males (let-7d, let-7i, miR-23a, miR-34b-3p, miR-99a, miR-126-3p, miR-132, miR-150, miR-151-5p, miR-181a) and females (miR-150, miR-539). Altogether, at least 20 cerebrovascular miRNAs effectively delineate AD versus Pre-AD pathology.

Conclusion:

Using the 3xTg-AD mouse model, these data demonstrate that cerebrovascular miRNAs pertaining to endothelial function, vascular permeability, angiogenesis, inflammation, and Aβ/tau metabolism can track early development of AD.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that impacts ~6.2 million people in the United States alone and continues to rise with an increasingly aging demographic of age 65 years and older [1]. A primary causative factor of AD pathology entails vascular dysfunction encompassing intracranial arteries/arterioles [2–4] and capillaries [5] that can result in a ~20% decrease in cerebral blood flow [3], reduced brain oxygenation [4], and increased presence of white matter hyperintensities [2, 6] compared to healthy controls without cognitive decline. Such hypoperfusion of the brain leads to reduction in cellular ATP synthesis that, in turn, results in numerous metabolic maladies as dysfunctional protein synthesis and degradation, ionic membrane pump dysfunction and signal transduction impairment [7]. Thus, over time, accumulated proteinopathy in the form of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau emerge as overt, classical biomarkers of AD [8]. The cellular impact of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles ranges from an imbalance among action potential firing and synaptic plasticity [9] to Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and cell death [10].

Large artery stiffness provides less dampening of pulse pressure accompanying bulk blood flow from the heart to the brain [11] that, in turn, can damage vulnerable intracranial microcirculatory regions (arterioles, capillaries) to compromise local perfusion of precise anatomical regions of the brain [12, 13]. Recent evidence demonstrates that cerebrovascular resistance in particular predicts progression of AD etiology from amyloid-independent brain atrophy and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to amyloidosis that generates and accompanies full blown dementia [14]. Thus, it is clear that early structural and functional remodeling of cerebral vessels underscores impaired blood flow delivery and perfusion of the brain to cause AD-type dementia [5, 14]. However, as a viable path to enhancing diagnosis and therapy, molecular vascular signatures of AD pathogenesis remain unclear. In such manner, there are multiple roles of the cerebral circulation to be aware of as moment-to-moment blood flow control, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis that altogether serve optimal perfusion of the brain for healthy cognition throughout life.

The “-omics” approach for resolving mechanisms of AD as genes (genomics), epigenetics (epigenomics), RNA (transcriptomics), metabolites (metabolomics), and proteins (proteomics) has been robustly investigated for over a decade now. Major recent breakthroughs have included comprehensive transcriptome analyses of the brain parenchyma of mice and humans [15] and, particularly, multi-omics analyses focused on resolving spatial transcriptomic to proteomic regulation [16–18]. With an exception of highlighting cerebrovascular endothelial cells as a sensitive regulatory interface between the circulatory system and the brain [19], a paucity of information remains for cerebrovascular –omics of aging and/or AD.

Non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate protein expression via degradation of coding messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or suppress translation [20]. Also, as a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool, miRNAs are promising biomarkers due to their novelty in modern -omics research while stable in blood [21]. Aberrant expression of selected miRNAs have been found in human peripheral blood and brain tissue during early [22, 23] and late [24, 25] stages of AD. Using a triple mutation mouse model [3xTg-AD; presenilin 1 (PS1), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tau genes] [26], prior studies have yielded information regarding altered expression of select circulatory [27] and cerebrovascular [28] miRNAs during AD pathology. However, a complete picture of cerebrovascular miRNA signatures accompanying early to late development of AD in the context of biological sex remains lacking.

Using innovative NanoString technology [29] to screen 599 miRNAs in purified cerebral vessels of AD mice, we tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular miRNA expression profiles provide a diagnostic map of the development of AD pathology. We used 3xTg-AD mice which begin young adult life with no apparent pathology (1–2 mo) and then progressively develop cognitive impairment (CI; 4–5 mo), extracellular amyloid deposits (Aβ; 6–8 mo), and Aβ plaques in combination with neurofibrillary tangles (AβT; 12–15 mo) as they age [26, 30]. A key advantage of the 3xTg-AD study model is that homozygous offspring develop phases of cumulative AD pathology over a measurable, phased aging process that are relatively absent in the originating background strain (B6129SF2/J;≤15 mo) per neurovascular coupling for cerebral blood flow [31], cognitive function [32], and learning/memory [30, 33]. In brief, we found that a total of 20 miRNAs can delineate AD versus Pre-AD pathology, whereby 15 are informative for early stage progression among individual biological sexes. With details of comparative relationships illustrated throughout datasets, we believe that our current cerebrovascular miRNA analysis advances our understanding of physiology while potentially underlying a unique diagnostic fingerprint for progression of AD.

METHODS

Animal care and use

All animal care use and experimental protocols for this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Loma Linda University and performed in accord with the National Research Council’s “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (8th Edition, 2011). Experiments were performed using male and female 3xTg-AD mice inbred using homozygous breeding pairs obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). We chose the 3xTg-AD study model [(B6;129-Tg (APP-Swe,tauP301L) 1Lfa Psen1tm1Mpm /Mmjax); Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) stock #034830]. In accord with the phases of cumulative AD pathology, we categorized the mice into four groups (3 males &amp; 3 females each) as young (1–2 mo), cognitive impairment (CI; 4–5 mo), presence of extracellular amyloid-β plaques (Aβ; 6–8 mo), and presence of Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau (AβT; 12–15 mo) [26, 30]. All animals were housed on a 12 : 12 h light-dark cycle at 22–24° C with fresh water and food available ad libitum.

Isolation of brain and cerebral vessel segments

Cerebral blood vessel segments were purified from each mouse brain using a protocol adapted from Cohen-Salmon laboratory [34] with some modifications. All steps were performed on ice under RNase-free conditions. Briefly, following isoflurane inhalation for anesthesia and decapitation, the brain was removed and place in a chilled HEPES-buffered Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; pH 7.4). Initial homogenization of the brain was performed using a pellet pestle motor (3431E25; Thomas Scientific, Irvine, CA, USA). The homogenate was transferred to a 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged (Jouan BR4; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 1,883 Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF; 4,100 Revolutions Per Minute, 100 mm rotor radius) for 15 min at 4°C. Additional centrifugation in a dextran solution at 1,883 RCF for 25 min at 4°C separated myelin material from the vessel pellet. Then, in the HBSS-HEPES buffer with bovine serum albumin (BSA), vessel segments were resuspended and filtered through a 20 μm-mesh filter (NY2004700; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) on a modified filter holder (SX0004700; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) on the top of a beaker flask. Remaining blood vessels on the filter membrane were resuspended in HBSS-HEPES with BSA buffer and centrifuged at 1,883 RCF for an additional 10 min. The blood vessel pellet was then resuspended again in HBSS-HEPES with BSA buffer followed by a final centrifugation in an Eppendorf tube at 10,000 RCF (5418R; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for 5 min at 4°C. Unless otherwise noted, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

RNA isolation and purification

Tissue was homogenized with RNase/Dnase free beads in RNA Lysis Buffer using the Bullet Blender (Storm 24; NextAdvance, Troy, NY, USA). Total RNA is extracted using Quick-RNA Microprep (R1050; Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was verified by A260/A280 nm absorption ratio ≥ 1.8 (Nanodrop OneC, ThermoFisher).

NanoString technology for miRNA profiling

Analysis was performed on all samples using the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, Washington, USA) and a mouse panel containing 599 miRNA barcodes (CSO-MMIR15-12, Mouse Version 1.5 miRNA assay). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, the NanoString nCounter platform mixed total RNA (≥ 150 ng per replicate) with pairs of capture and color-coded, bar-tagged reporter probes that uniquely indicated each miRNA. Six positive and eight negative controls were included in the nCounter panel for analysis. Additional quality controls for miRNA profiling included six for ligation efficiency and specificity (three positive, three negative) and three as internal, “spiked in” controls (ath-miR159a, cel-miR-248, and osa-miR414). Using nSolver (Version 4.0; NanoString Technologies, Inc.), each sample was normalized according to the geometric mean of the top 100 most highly expressed miRNAs. The mean plus twice the standard deviation of the eight negative controls for each sample was subtracted from each miRNA count in that sample. Following subtraction, only miRNAs with detectable normalized counts of ≥ 5 [35] across all samples were retained for further analysis.

Statistical analysis

Graph Pad Prism (Version 9; San Diego, CA, USA) was used for plotting data and conducting data analysis. For simultaneous comparison among pathology groups (young versus CI versus Aβ versus AβT or Pre-AD versus AD) and both sexes, statistical analysis included two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc was used for data sets with more than two groups for comparison (i.e., among pathology groups with data from sexes combined). The two-tailed unpaired t-test was used for comparisons between two groups as combined pre-AD versus AD data sets. For total miRNA datasets that did not follow normal distribution as determined by the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus test (~30% of miRNAs), the Mann-Whitney unpaired t-test and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test (with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons) were applied as appropriate and specified in the figure legends. Per the hypothesis and experimental design of the study, respective data sets were not matched, paired, and/or analyzed using repeated-measures analysis within and between groups. An n of 1 represents one independent miRNA expression analysis from one mouse brain. All summary data are presented as the mean ± SEM and differences among groups were accepted as statistically significant with p &lt; 0.05.

RESULTS

In the present study, we sought to determine a miRNA profile of cerebral blood vessels of the brain with an emphasis on general AD development and the role of biological sex. Using NanoString technology [23], we screened for 599 miRNAs, whereby 86 miRNAs were quantifiable across all groups while containing miRNAs selectively expressed in endothelium (miR-126-3p/5p [36, 37]; miR-23a/b &amp; miR-24 [38]; miR-27a [39]) and smooth muscle/pericytes (miR-143 [40]; miR-145 [38, 41]), andred blood cells (miR-486, miR-451, &amp; miR-16 [42]) (Fig. 1). Also, expressed miRNAs correspond to pathways pertaining to remodeled vascular function (e.g., endothelial proliferation, migration, inflammation, permeability and nitric oxide signaling) and regulation of amyloidosis. In brief, we found that cerebrovascular miRNAs effectively indicate early development of AD pathology. See Table 1 for significant relationships among analyses for all 86 miRNAs for progression of AD pathology with and without biological sexes combined.

Cerebrovascular miRNAs indicate pre-AD versus AD pathology

Our first analysis included a screen of the potential cerebrovascular miRNAs that alter in expression among AD (Aβ and/or AβT) versus pre-AD (young and/or CI) regardless of biological sex. Four miRNAs were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) downregulated as let-7d (Fig. 2A), miR-132 (Fig. 2G), miR-151-5p (Fig. 2M), and miR-181a (Fig. 2O), whereas one miRNA increased in expression as miR-690 (Fig. 2AA) for young versus Aβ and/or AβT. Two miRNAs as miR-690 (Fig. 2AA) and miR-99a (Fig. 2AC) indicated significant upregulation and downregulation respectively for Aβ versus CI.

For overall for AD versus pre-AD pathology, 12 miRNAs were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) downregulated as let-7d (Fig. 2B), let-7g (Fig. 2D), miR-126-3p (Fig. 2F), miR-132 (Fig. 2H), miR-135a (Fig. 2J), miR-150 (Fig. 2L), miR-151-5p (Fig. 2N), miR-181a (Fig. 2P), miR-23a (Fig. 2R), miR-23b (Fig. 2T), miR-27a (Fig. 2V), and miR-99a (Fig. 2AD), whereas three miRNAs increased in expression as miR-29a (Fig. 2X), miR-29c (Fig. 2Z), and miR-690 (Fig. 2AB).

Cerebrovascular miRNAs indicate pre-AD versus AD pathology in accord with biological sex

When cerebrovascular miRNAs are considered among AD (Aβ and AβT) versus pre-AD (young and CI) groups in accord with biological sex, ten (Fig. 3A–E: miR-126-3p, miR-150, miR-151-5p, miR-23a, and miR-34b-3p; Fig. 4B, D, F, H, J: let-7d, let 7i, miR-132, miR-181a, miR-99a) and two (Fig. 3B, F: miR-150 and miR-539) miRNAs are significantly (p &lt; 0.05) altered in expression for males and females respectively. Although not related to progression of AD pathology per se, 31 and 8 mRNAs indicated (p &lt; 0.05) male versus female differences in the pre-AD and AD groups respectively (Table 1).

Cerebrovascular miRNAs indicate transitions within pre-AD to early AD conditions

During our refined investigation to determine whether cerebrovascular miRNAs can indicate transitions throughout pre-AD and/or onset of early AD, we found that significantly (p &lt; 0.05) altered expression was apparent between the young and Aβ groups for six miRNAs (Fig. 4A, C, E, G: let-7d, let-7i, miR-132, and miR-181a; Fig. 5A, B: let-7g and miR-1944) and one miRNA for the CI versus Aβ groups (Fig. 4I: miR-99a) in males. With the exception of let-7g and miR-1944, these miRNAs were indicative of the overall pre-AD to AD transition as well (Fig. 4B, D, F, H, J). Further, differences among the young and CI groups during pre-AD were indicated (p &lt; 0.05) by four cerebrovascular miRNAs, two in males (Fig. 5A, B: let-7g and miR-1944) and two in females (Fig. 5C, D: miR-133a and miR-2140) respectively. Note that a comparison of the young versus CI groups in males for let-7i (Fig. 4C) and miR-181a (Fig. 4G) yielded p-values of 0.0501 and 0.0587 respectively. With the exception of one miRNA (miR-2141; Table 1), no miRNAs were found to indicate significant differences between the Aβ and AβT groups (sexes combined or separated), suggesting that cerebrovascular miRNAs may be useful for tracking early development of AD.

DISCUSSION

With the recent addition of a monoclonal Aβ antibody (Aducanumab) to help delay cognitive decline [43], a total of five drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating AD as a result of over two decades of dedicated research and clinical trials. Currently &gt; 120 drugs to treat AD are in clinical trials, whereby only four agents are intended to directly treat a primary underlying contributor as vascular dysfunction [44]. Recent findings continue to illustrate the importance of cerebrovascular health per the development of cognitive impairment and AD pathology [6, 45] while pointing to novel biomarkers for diagnosis and therapy as vascular and/or circulating miRNAs [27, 28, 46]. Thus, we conducted a study to determine whether cerebrovascular miRNA expression profiles can mark developmental stages of AD pathology. We employed a study model (3xTg-AD mice) that completely develops cumulative phases of AD pathology [26, 30] including a ~50% decrease in neurovascular regulation of cerebral blood flow [31] over ~12 months of age. Our cerebrovascular preparations were enriched with expression of miRNAs that are selectively expressed in endothelium, smooth muscle and/or pericytes. In brief, we found a total of 20 cerebrovascular miRNAs that indicate transitions among AD versus pre-AD pathology, whereby four demonstrate significance for transition to cognitive impairment among male and female animals. As challenges remain for detecting and treating MCI and preclinical AD [47], our data advance basic science knowledge for diagnosing and treating AD etiology. Clinical implications via a reasonably thorough cross-referencing analysis with the broader literature have been provided below.

Current knowledge of circulatory and vascular expression of miRNAs in 3xTg-AD mice: clear and consistent roles for miR-132 and miR-126-3p

The transition from overall pre-AD versus AD pathology in comparisons that combined biological sexes was indicated by 15 miRNAs (Fig. 2). With similarities to a prior study examining plasma samples isolated from 3xTg-AD animals (2–3 mo versus 14–15 mo), we detected an abundance of the let-7 family, miR-23/24/27 cluster, and miR-29 cluster while having detected less (e.g., miR-9) or none (e.g., miR-302a/b, miR-488) of various miRNAs respectively [27]. Garza-Manero and colleagues found plasma miRNAs in old 3xTg-AD animals (male 14–15 mo animals versus 2–3 mo) characterized by miR-132, miR-138, miR-146a, miR-146b, miR-22, miR-24, miR-29a/c, and miR-34a [27]. In our hands for cerebral vessels isolated from male and female 3xTg-AD animals with no miRNAs marking between the Aβ (6–8 mo) and AβT groups (12–15 mo), we detected miR-132, miR-146a (not miR-146b), miR-22, miR-24, miR29a/c, and miR-34c (not miR-34a). Of those, three were related to progression of AD pathology (miR-132, miR-29a/c; Fig. 2), whereas the rest indicated sex differences among pre-AD and/or AD animals (miR-146a, miR-22, miR-34c) or did not alter at all among groups (miR-24). The downregulation of miR-132 indicating the onset of Aβ pathology and onward (6–15 mo; Figs. 2G, 2H, 4E, 4F) in particular is consistent with the 3xTg-AD study conducted by Garza-Manero and colleagues [27]. For reference, age-related alterations in wild-type mice (male 14–15 mo animals versus 2–3 mo) were indicated by let-7c/e/i, miR-106b, miR-126a, miR-130a, miR-140, miR-194, miR-195a, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-26b, miR-28c, miR-30a, miR-30e, miR-337, miR-409, miR-455, and miR-7a [27]. In our hands, let-7c/e/i, miR-126-3p (same as miR-126a), miR-26b, miR-28, and miR-30a were detectable, whereby let-7i (Fig. 4C, D) and miR-126-3p (Figs. 2F, 3A) are the only miRNAs that indicate significance among AD progression and/or contribution of biological sex.

Fu and colleagues examined isolated capillaries of 3xTg-AD mice whereby onset and progression of AD was first marked by miR-126 (selectively expressed in endothelium) [36, 37] and miR-145 (selectively expressed in smooth muscle and pericytes) [38, 41] and then additionally miR-21, miR-29b, and miR-195 by 9 months relative to age-matched wild-type animals [28]. In the present study examining a total cerebral blood vessel isolation from 3xTg-AD animals, only miR-126a-3p and miR-145 were detected, whereby miR-126a-3p indicates progression of AD pathology (Figs. 2F, 3A) and miR-145 is less in expression in males versus females regardless of AD pathology. Although, as related to the miR-29 cluster, miR-29a (Fig. 2X) and miR-29c (Fig. 2Z) indicate AD versus pre-AD pathology but only when data from biological sexes are combined.

Overall, miR-132 and miR-126-3p appear to play clear and distinct roles in the circulation and/or cerebrovasculature of 3xTg-AD animals respectively across studies. miR-132 participates in the molecular events leading to Aβ deposition via regulation of Aβ metabolism, including tau, MAPK, and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1) [48]. Consistent with our present findings of a consistent decrease in miR-132 in males (Fig. 4E, F), another study has shown that miR-132/212 deficiency in 3xTg-AD mice (6–18 mo) leads to enhanced tau pathology and memory impairment, which can be rescued at least in part by miR-132 mimetics [49]. Further, decreased miR-132 expression in the hippocampus and medial frontal gyrus of male and female AD (Braak score 4 to 6) versus non-demented (Braak score 0 to 3) subjects coincides with deficits in neuronal differentiation via regulation of p250GAP as Rho family GTPase enriched in the brain [50]. MiR-126 is endothelial cell-specific while promoting vascular integrity and angiogenesis [36, 51]. Also, cerebrovascular miR-126 may play a role in the clearance of Aβ from the perivascular space in 3xTg-AD mice [28]. Thus, a decrease in the expression of cerebrovascular miR-126 in our hands (Figs. 2F, 3A) and others [28] may point to impaired mechanisms to address accumulating amyloidosis that accompanies early to late stage AD. MiR-132 and miR-126-3p are clear markers for cerebrovascular Aβ metabolism and clearance respectively, whereby their decreased expression appears reliable for detection of early AD while ideal therapeutic targets. Although not necessarily exclusive for AD pathology and/or cerebrovascular function per se, our findings also demonstrate key roles for the let-7, miR-23/24/27, and miR-29 clusters as discussed next.

The let-7, miR-23/24/27, and miR-29 clusters

The let-7 family has been widely recognized throughout studies of pathology including an array of vascular diseases [52]. Let-7b, c, d, e, f, g, and i were detectable in mouse cerebral vessels in the current study (Fig. 1). While let-7i had a tendency to do so (p = 0.05; Fig. 4C), let-7d (Fig. 4A) and let-7g (Fig. 5A) marked (p &lt; 0.05) CI onset in male animals. All three of these particular let-7 family members significantly marked the onset of Aβ pathology. In humans, downregulated plasma levels of members let-7d and 7g have been identified as potential diagnostic markers in MCI and AD patients [53, 54]. As shown using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), let-7d can modulate proliferation, migration, tubulogenesis of endothelial cells while a negative regulator of the interferon-induced protein 44 like (IFI44L) gene [55]. Also, let-7g downregulates the thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), transforming growth factor-β receptor type 1 (TGFβR1), and SMAD family member 2 (SMAD2) genes in the TGF-β pathway to reduce endothelial cell inflammation and increases angiogenesis [56]. Finally, let-7i controls toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, whereby its overexpression prevents cell death and protects the blood-brain barrier [57]. Altogether, these findings further expand the general pathological importance of the Let-7 family to now including the etiology of AD.

The miR-23/24/27 cluster is known for its regulation of endothelial cell junctions, whereby miR-23a and miR-23b inhibit vascular permeability and angiogenesis respectively [58]. In addition to miR-181a (Figs. 2O, 2P, 4G, 4H) involved in the early progression of AD [59], the expression of miR-23a (Figs. 2Q, 2R, 3D), miR-23b (Fig. 2S, T), and miR-27a (Fig. 2U, V) are all reduced during AD. Also, this general finding has also been noted for decreased serum concentrations of miR-27b-3p, miR-23a-3p, and miR-181a-5p in AD patients containing a polymorphism in synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) associated with cognitive decline and brain atrophy [60]. Collectively, these findings tie the miR-23/24/27 cluster into the maintenance of a physiologically critical interface as the vascular regulation of neuronal health.

The miR-29 cluster is known for a plethora of roles encompassing anti-fibrotic regulation of the extracellular matrix (e.g., via MMP2), immunity (e.g., interferon-γ), cell differentiation [Ying Yang 1 (YY1), Histone Deacetylase 4 (HDAC4)], and apoptosis (Tcl1, Mcl1) [61]. Also, miR-29c in particular directly targets the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of β-secretase 1 (BACE1) mRNA essential to accumulation of amyloid during sporadic AD [62]. Contrary to 80% of the other significantly altered miRNAs per AD pathology, miR-29a (Fig. 2X) and miR-29c (Fig. 2Z) were upregulated in addition to miR-690 (Fig. 2AB) and miR-34b-3p (Fig. 3E) during AD. While remaining controversial in their roles for various types of vascular injury [61] and AD pathology [63], such upregulation of miR-29a/c in cerebral vessels is consistent with dysregulated vascular remodeling (e.g., fibrosis, abnormal branching) to be expected concomitant with neurodegenerative disease.

Other key miRNAs for indicating AD versus pre-AD conditions: miR-34b-3p, miR-150, miR-151-5p, miR-181a, and miR-539

There are also several other cerebrovascular miRNAs that indicated conditions of AD in the current study. As a component of the miR-34 cluster that negatively regulates SIRT1 to potentially cause atherosclerosis [64], miR-34b-3p was significantly upregulated in male AD animals (Fig. 3E).

We observed decreased expression in miR-150 for overall AD pathology (Fig. 2L) and this was consistent throughout for both males and females (Fig. 3B). Recently, miR-150 was identified to regulate endothelial progenitor cell differentiation and promote thrombus resolution [65], and increased platelet adhesion and thrombus formation indeed becomes apparent in old 3xTg-AD mice (&gt; 18 mo) [66]. MiR-151-5p is downregulated during the Aβ phase and on during AD (Fig. 2M, N) as most prominent for males (Fig. 3C). There is evidence that miR-151a-5p reduces cellular ATP production by targeting cytochrome B (CYTB) [67] while also able to inhibit phospholemman essential to cardiac function [68]. Thus, it can be speculated that downregulation of miR-151a-5p may be an adaptation mechanism to control cellular respiration while causing cardiovascular instability. Like miR-151a-5p, miR-181a is also downregulated during the Aβ phase and on during AD (Fig. 2O, P) as maintained throughout for males (Fig. 4G, H). In addition to its potential cooperation with the miR-23/24/27 cluster during AD [60], miR-181a is known for slowing the loss of pericytes and blood-brain barrier breakdown via targeting Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) in APP/PS1 mice as another mouse model of AD [69]. miR-539 is more abundantly expressed in females versus males during pre-AD while having significantly decreased during AD (Fig. 3F). Finally, miR-539 is thought to play a general neuroprotective role, whereby its deficiency can be associated with Aβ accumulation, tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in AD human and mouse models via targeting APP, CAV1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) [70]. As consistent with miR-132, miR-126-3p, and the clusters (let-7, miR-23/24/27, and miR-29), these miscellaneous cerebrovascular miRNAs indicate changes expected of an animal model undergoing development of AD.

MiRNAs that selectively mark the beginning edge of AD as the Aβ group relative to CI: miR-690 and miR-99a

Two miRNAs mark the transition from CI of pre-AD to Aβ of AD as upregulation (miR-690; Fig. 2AA) and downregulation (miR-99a; Figs. 2AC, 4I). In addition to its general role as a positive regulator of Runx2-induced osteogenic differentiation [71], miR-690 may play a protective role against inflammation by targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 (MAP2K3) and overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system during obesity [72]. MiR-690 can also beneficially modulate macrophage inflammation and insulin signaling by targeting NAD Kinase (NADK) [73]. Thus, miR-690 may play an adaptive mechanism during AD to control inflammation with potential consequences of dysregulated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells in the vasculature [71]. The vascular role of miR-99a is more straightforward as it inhibits endothelial cell inflammation underlying atherosclerosis by targeting the mTOR and the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling axis [74]. Altogether, it can be speculated that the interface among pre-AD and AD conditions consists of subtle controls on cell adaptation/differentiation and inflammation in response to initial amyloidosis.

MiRNAs that mark onset of cognitive impairment in males and females: let-7g, miR-1944, miR-133a, andmiR-2140

The downregulated expression of let-7g (Fig. 5A) and miR-1944 (Fig. 5B) marked onset of CI in male animals, whereas miR-133a (Fig. 5C) and miR-2140 (Fig. 5D) were indicative of CI in females. It may be worth noting that let-7i (Fig. 4C) and miR-181a (Fig. 4G) also marked young versus CI groups in males without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.050 and p = 0.059 respectively, two-way ANOVA). In addition to the let-7 discussion above, significant differences in let-7g have been detected in extracellular vesicles of human subjects with mild AD [75]. MiR-133a inhibits caveolin-1 (CAV1) as a negative regulator of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [76], and thus, its early reduction for compromised nitric oxide-mediated blood flow to and throughout the brain may explain onset of CI in 3xTg-AD females. Prior studies also show that estrogen treatment upregulates miR-133a expression to reduce pulmonary arterial hypertension and vascular remodeling by targeting the transcription factor SP1, the long non-coding RNA MYOSLID, serum response factor (SRF), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) [77]. In females, miR-133a also negatively regulates vascular smooth muscle-mediated arterial calcification via targeting Runx2 [78]. Thus, a concomitant increase in miR-690 (upregulated during conditions of AD; Fig. 2AA, 2AB) as a positive regulator of Runx2 [71] may serve to further exacerbate pathological vascular remodeling. Although also related to regulation of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) [79], a role of miR-133a has yet to be more thoroughly examined for AD etiology per the brain parenchyma. As of the present, roles for miR-1944 and miR-2140 for males and females respectively appear to be completely unknown, warranting further studies for indicating CI. The role of biological sex during and development and response to AD pathology remains an important topic for investigation [80].

Differential miRNA expression patterns among cerebral vessels and the brain parenchyma

It should be noted that there are overlapping miRNAs among cerebral blood vessels and the brain parenchyma that differ in expression patterns during development of AD. For example, contrary to findings for cerebral vessels, miR-126-3p may also increase in expression in the hippocampus during AD with resulting impaired internalization and clearance of Aβ1-42 in the brain parenchyma via decreased expression of the target of Myb1 membrane trafficking protein (TOM1) [81]. Likewise, in contrast to a significant downregulation in the present study, miR-181a has been found to increase in the hippocampus during AD and thereby contribute to synaptic dysfunction via decreased SIRT1 and c-fos [82] and/or suppressed translin and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor expression [83]. There is also evidence of loss in expression of miR-29 to control BACE1 levels in the hippocampus during AD [84, 85], whereas we observed significant increases for both miR-29a and miR-29c in cerebral blood vessels. A member of the miR-34 family (miR-34a, targets metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 or GRM7) is upregulated in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice (6 mo) [86], whereas miR-34b is also upregulated in the current study. Expression of miR-34a corresponding to dysfunction of synaptic plasticity, energy metabolism, and resting state network activity was significantly increased in the temporal cortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice by 12 months of age but not in the frontal cortex and cerebellum [87]. Although expressed, we did not see AD-related changes in miRNA-146a corresponding to inflammation in the neocortex and hippocampus of Tg2576 (12 mo) and 5xFAD (3 mo) mouse models [88]. As various miRNAs overlap in expression in different cell types throughout the brain, these findings support the need for a crucial awareness of the disease context per animal model, age, biological sex, miRNA distribution/gradients among tissue compartments, and targets of an miRNA within a given cell type.

Importance of other non-coding RNAs in the literature not detected or significantly altered over the course of AD pathology in this study

The current study does not rule out the diagnostic and/or therapeutic potential of other miRNAs not detected in our analysis. For example, lentiviral delivery of miR-31 improves cognition by targeting APP1 and BACE1 while decreasing extracellular and intracellular Aβ deposits in old (17 mo) female 3xTg-AD animals [89]. Similarly, induction of hippocampal miR-342-3p and use of an antagomir ameliorates Aβ plaque burden and associated learning and memory [90]. Loss of miR-369 promotes tau phosphorylation by targeting the Fyn and SRSF Protein Kinase 2 (SRPK2) signaling pathways underlying learning and memory deficits in 3xTg-AD mice (12 mo), whereby restoring miR-369 reversed such effects [91]. Silencing the receptor Kremen1 (Krm1) with miR-431, blocks the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to prevent Aβ-mediated synapse loss in cortical and hippocampal cultures isolated from 3xTg-AD mice (6 mo) [92]. Also, miR-155 [associated with Aβ-mediated activation of glial cells via interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-β (IFN-β)] is upregulated in the brain tissue of 3xTg-AD mice (12 mo), whereby decreasing its level via c-Jun signaling may ameliorate AD-related neuroinflammation [93]. Although not significantly altered in aging 3xTg-AD animals in our hands, targeting neuronal and endothelial miR-146a throughout the brain may also ameliorate metabolic dysregulation and inflammation during AD [94]. Expression of miR-125b-3p/5p was not significantly altered in aging 3xTg-AD animals but suppression of miR-125b in neurons can reduce tau phosphorylation [95]. Further, there is ongoing examination of long non-coding RNAs (&gt; 200 nucleotides versus ~22 for miRNAs) which have indicated conditions of AD versus pre-AD as upregulated cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction for inflammation and downregulated tryptophan metabolism potentially associated with impaired production of serotonin and melatonin in the brain [96]. Altogether, the reader should also be mindful of other potential non-coding RNAs mechanisms for AD pathology development and the treatment thereof.

Experimental considerations: potential overlap among “age-related” and “AD” miRNAs

In the current study, we did not examine age- and sex-matched B6129SF2/J mice as the originating background wild-type strain for generating 3xTg-AD animals. However, the significance of our data encompasses the early development of AD up to 8 months at the oldest age point, whereby cerebrovascular structure [45], neurovascular function [31], and cognition [30, 32, 33] remain relatively stable in wild-type animals. With reference to a previous study that examined male 14–15 mo versus 2–3 mo wild-type mice [27], the only miRNAs in mice with potential age-related overlap include let-7i and miR-126-3p per current findings of AD progression and/or contribution of biological sex. Further, mouse miR-34a that targets SIRT1 as a key “aging” miRNA [97] was not detected with significance in the current study. Although, it should be noted that other members of the miR-34 family as miR-34b-3p and miR-34c were present as indicated in Table 1. With expanded evidence for human aging [98, 99], it is possible that miR-29a and miR-132 may also be playing roles regardless of a given pathology. Such considerations are a small snapshot pointing to the need for further investigation of miRNA signaling relationships across mouse and human study models for physiological investigation and therapeutic purposes.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Optimal cerebral blood flow is required for a healthy brain while dependent on primary processes as myogenic regulation, vascular permeability, angiogenesis, control of inflammation, and prevention of amyloidosis. Emerging evidence consistently demonstrates that impaired perfusion of the brain is central to development of neurodegenerative disease with AD as the flagship dementia. In the present study, we endeavored to locate a comprehensive panel of cerebrovascular miRNAs to closely track the progression of AD pathology to help advance our knowledge of potential diagnosis in addition to therapy. In such manner, we employed NanoString technology [29] to examine 599 miRNAs in the cerebral vessels of male and female 3xTg-AD animals (1 to 15 mo) that develop phases of early- to late-stage AD. A total of 86 miRNAs were appreciably detected with 20 miRNAs indicating the onset of overall AD pathology and/or the nuances thereof as the cumulative presence of CI, extracellular Aβ plaques, and/or neurofibrillary tangles. Remarkably, such miRNAs varied throughout the range of sensitivity from indication of AD regardless of biological sex (e.g., miR-690) to marking onset of CI in males (e.g., let-7g) and females (e.g., miR-133a) respectively. Two miRNAs even marked the transition from the CI to Aβ groups as miR-690 and miR-99a. Although consensus with human samples is needed, our panel is informative for early onset of AD as cerebrovascular miRNAs were not informative for marking progression beyond the presence of extracellular Aβ. What is more, is that all of such miRNAs are representative of the vasculature and its vital place in the brain while sufficient for effectively cross-referencing with the broader literature for informative value regarding various mouse models and human subjects of AD. It is expected that our present data will help advance diagnosis and therapy for prevention and/or treatment of early AD.
