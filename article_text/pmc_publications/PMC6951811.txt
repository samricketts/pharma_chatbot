Objective:

To determine whether cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with subsequent diagnoses of Parkinson disease, and whether these associations are similar in magnitude to those with subsequent diagnoses of Alzheimer disease.

Methods:

This was a retrospective cohort study using claims data from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2008–2015. The exposures were stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, valvular heart disease, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease. The secondary outcome was a new diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Marginal structural Cox models adjusting for time-dependent confounding were used to characterize the association between exposures and outcomes. We also evaluated the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent renal colic (negative control).

Results:

Among 1,035,536 Medicare beneficiaries followed for a mean of 5.2 years, 15,531 (1.5%) participants were diagnosed with Parkinson disease and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with Alzheimer disease. Most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.39–1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of Parkinson disease. The magnitudes of these associations were similar, but attenuated, to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease. Confirming the validity of our analytical model, most cerebrovascular risk factors were not associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic.

Interpretation:

Cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with Parkinson disease, an effect comparable to their association with Alzheimer disease.

Introduction

Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects approximately 630,000 people in the United States, and its prevalence is expected to double by 2040.1 Alzheimer disease (AD), another neurodegenerative condition and the most common cause of dementia,2 shares risk factors and neuropathological features with cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that cerebrovascular risk factors and cerebrovascular dysfunction can promote the development and progression of AD.2–8 In an analogous manner, PD may be associated with cerebrovascular disease.9–12 Signs and symptoms of PD can result from strategic infarcts in the basal ganglia or diffuse periventricular white matter lesions caused by small vessel arteriosclerosis (so-called “vascular parkinsonism”),13–15 and autopsy data have provided evidence of cerebrovascular disease in patients with PD.16 These findings, albeit preliminary, raise the possibility that, like in AD, there might be shared pathogenic pathways between cerebrovascular disease and PD. Nevertheless, conflicting reports exist regarding the epidemiological associations between cerebrovascular disease and its risk factors and PD, and most studies on this topic did not fully account for confounders, were underpowered, or focused on individual vascular diseases.17–31

Given the substantial prevalence and health burden imposed by PD, developing a firmer understanding of its risk factors could provide insight into underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and new targets for prevention and treatment. We therefore sought to clarify the associations between cerebrovascular disease risk factors and PD in a large, diverse, population-based cohort. We also sought to compare the relationship between cerebrovascular disease and PD with that of cerebrovascular disease and AD. We hypothesized that cerebrovascular disease risk factors would be associated with the subsequent diagnosis of PD, and that the magnitude of the associations would be comparable to those seen with AD.

Methods

Design

We performed a retrospective cohort study using inpatient and outpatient administrative claims data from a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 66 years of age from January 1, 2008 through September 30, 2015. Under the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provide fee-for-service health insurance to approximately 70% of American residents 65 years of age or older. CMS organizes claims for individual patients submitted by providers and hospitals into deidentified datasets, which can then be used for research. Each Medicare beneficiary is given a unique patient identifier that allows for longitudinal linkage across multiple visits including at different settings and facilities. Individual Medicare claims include dates of service and up to 25 International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes. Weill Cornell Medicine’s institutional review board approved this analysis of deidentified data and waived the requirement for informed consent. The claims data used in this analysis are restricted per the terms of Medicare’s data use agreement and therefore cannot be shared directly with other investigators. However, investigators can obtain access to these data by application to the CMS.

Population

We included patients throughout the United States with continuous fee-for-service Medicare coverage (Parts A and B) for at least 1 year or until death, if applicable. In order to allow sufficient time for enrollment and documentation of care, we excluded patients younger than 66 years of age. As the focus of the study was incident PD or AD, a run-in period was constructed, whereby patients with any diagnosis of PD or AD in the year after study entry (i.e., 2008 calendar year) were excluded.

Measurements

The exposures of interest were cerebrovascular risk factors, which included prior stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), valvular heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. These risk factors were identified through ICD-9-CM diagnostic code algorithms used in prior claims-based studies.32, 33 Compared to medical record review, cerebrovascular risk factors identified through Medicare claims ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes are reported to have positive predictive values (PPV) of greater than 95% and negative predictive values ranging from 52–91%.34 The primary outcome, a new diagnosis of idiopathic PD, was identified, as in prior studies, by at least 2 separate outpatient claims with ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 332.0 in any diagnostic position. This algorithm has been previously validated to have a PPV of 79%.35 Claims for vascular parkinsonism (332.1), drug-induced parkinsonism (332.1), dementia with Lewy bodies (331.82), and other degenerative basal ganglia syndromes (333.0) are not included in this algorithm; however, if patients had one or more of these claims in addition to 2 separate outpatient claims for ICD-9-CM code 332.0, then they met diagnostic criteria for the primary outcome of PD.

As points of comparison, we also evaluated the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and 1) AD and 2) renal colic. AD was analyzed because, like PD, it is a neurodegenerative condition that has been linked to cerebrovascular disease. Diagnoses of AD were identified by any outpatient or inpatient claim with ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 331.0 in any diagnostic position; this algorithm has been previously shown to identify diagnoses of AD or other dementias with a PPV of 72% and a negative predictive value of 86%.36 Meanwhile, renal colic was analyzed as a “negative control” due its unlikely biological association with cerebrovascular disease. Diagnoses of renal colic were identified by any inpatient or outpatient claim with ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 788.0 in any diagnostic position, as in previous claims-based studies.37

Statistical Analysis

We sought to evaluate the relationship between cerebrovascular risk factors and the time-based risks of developing study outcomes. The Cox proportional hazards model is a commonly used method of calculating the time-based risk of an outcome from an exposure. However, for this study, such models would produce biased risk estimates because many time-dependent cerebrovascular risk factors are also predictors for death, and several of these factors are common diseases that might interact with or confound the relationship between other cerebrovascular risk factors and PD (i.e., diabetes is a risk factor for coronary artery disease, which may also be a risk factor for PD). Therefore, we instead constructed marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models, which provide more robust risk estimates in the presence of time-dependent confounding.38 We used inverse probability weighting with standardization weights to estimate hazard ratios of the associations between study exposures and outcomes in the total study population. The weights were estimated from a random 30% partition of the data, while the marginal structural hazards models were estimated from the remaining 70%. Robust (sandwich) standard errors were used for computing confidence intervals. Besides cerebrovascular risk factors, the marginal structural models were also adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and baseline Charlson comorbidities.39 Patients were followed until the time of death, departure from Medicare insurance, or end of study (September 30, 2015).

We performed four sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD. First, as anti-psychotic medicines (i.e., dopamine antagonists) have been associated with both cerebrovascular risk factors and parkinsonism,40 we censored patients at the time of a psychotic disorder diagnosis (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 291.0–298.9). Second, we excluded PD outcomes in patients who had comorbid diagnoses of vascular dementia (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 290.4x) or other non-AD dementia (ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes 046.1x, 290.0, 290.1x, 290.2x, 290.3, 291.2, 294.1x, 294.2x, 294.8, 331.11, 331.19, 331.2, 331.82, 333.4, 797). Third, for the diagnosis of PD, we required that at least one of the two or more separate outpatient claims for idiopathic PD (ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 332.0) were made by a neurologist. Fourth, to examine the relationship between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD as a first event, we treated an AD diagnosis during follow-up as a censoring event in addition to death, departure from Medicare insurance, or end of study.

We also performed a secondary analysis that examined the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and AD as a first event by treating a PD diagnosis during follow-up as a censoring event in addition to the factors listed above. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R version 3.4.1 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).

Results

Patient Characteristics

After excluding 11,920 patients who had a diagnosis of PD and 28,610 patients who had a diagnosis of AD in the 2008 run-in period, the final study cohort included 1,035,536 patients (mean age, 75.9 years), of whom 59.2% were women (Table 1). At baseline, mean age for patients subsequently diagnosed with PD was 76.1 (SD, 6.2), while the mean age for patients not subsequently diagnosed with PD was 75.9 (SD, 7.2). The baseline prevalence of demographic and cerebrovascular risk factors at study entry stratified by the subsequent diagnosis of AD are provided in Table 2. At baseline, mean age for patients subsequently diagnosed with AD was 79.7 (SD, 6.7), while the mean age for patients not subsequently diagnosed with AD was 75.5 (SD, 7.1). During a mean follow-up of 5.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 2.1), 15,531 (1.5%) were diagnosed with PD, and 81,974 (7.9%) were diagnosed with AD. Among patients diagnosed with PD, 3,645 (23.5%) also had an AD diagnosis.

Primary Analyses

In marginal structural Cox models, with the exception of alcohol abuse and hyperlipidemia, all evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors, including prior stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39–1.72), were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of PD (Table 3). Of studied factors, obstructive sleep apnea had the strongest association with subsequent PD (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.56–1.75). Meanwhile, all evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of AD. The magnitude of the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and the subsequent diagnosis of PD were similar but attenuated as compared to the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and AD, except for obstructive sleep apnea, which demonstrated a stronger association with subsequent PD.

Negative Control Analysis

In marginal structural Cox models, 11 out of 14 reported cerebrovascular risk factors were not significantly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of renal colic (Table 4). Alcohol abuse was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent renal colic, whereas chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea were associated with an increased risk of subsequent renal colic.

Sensitivity Analyses

The associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD were generally unchanged when censoring for any psychotic disorder diagnoses (Table 5). After excluding PD patients with comorbid diagnoses of vascular (n=848) or other non-AD dementias (n=5,329), most cerebrovascular risk factors (12 of 14) remained associated with a diagnosis of PD, although the magnitude of the associations were generally attenuated (Table 6). When restricting the diagnosis of PD to cases diagnosed by a neurologist (n=10,285; 66.2% of PD cases in the primary analysis), the associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD were essentially unchanged (Table 7). When censoring for diagnoses of AD during follow-up, most cerebrovascular risk factors (12 of 14) remained associated with subsequent PD, and the magnitude of these associations were similar to those of the primary analysis (Table 8).

Secondary Analysis

The associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and AD were generally unchanged when censoring for diagnoses of PD during follow-up. In this analysis, all 14 cerebrovascular risk factors were associated with AD, and the magnitude of these associations (data not shown) were similar to those of the primary analysis.

Discussion

In a large population-based analysis of Medicare beneficiaries, we found that most cerebrovascular risk factors were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of PD. The magnitudes of these associations were similar but attenuated to those seen with subsequent AD, another common neurodegenerative disease previously linked to cerebrovascular disease. The cerebrovascular risk factors that demonstrated the strongest associations with PD were obstructive sleep apnea, prior stroke, and congestive heart failure. The associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD were robust even after excluding patients with non-AD dementias, censoring for AD or psychotic disorders, and restricting to PD diagnoses by neurologists. Additionally, in a separate but identically designed analysis, no cerebrovascular risk factors besides chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea were positively associated with the subsequent diagnosis of renal colic. As chronic kidney disease and obstructive sleep apnea have both been previously linked to nephrolithiasis, these results reinforce the validity of our analytical model.41, 42

Previous studies have reported conflicting findings regarding the association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent PD. For instance, Miyake et al reported that hypertension was associated with a reduced risk of PD, whereas Qiu et al reported the converse, and Simon et al reported no association between these conditions.20, 23, 24 Similarly, Driver et al, Xu et al, and Hu et al reported that diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of PD;18, 21, 22, while Miyake et al reported the opposite, and Simon et al reported no significant PD risk with diabetes.20, 24 In contrast, in our study, most evaluated cerebrovascular risk factors were associated with the subsequent diagnosis of PD. These conflicting reports could be due to differences in populations, time periods, analytical techniques, and statistical power between studies. In addition, compared to the current analysis, previous studies on this topic demonstrated variability in the magnitude of risks, especially those that focused on individual diseases.17–23 In this context, our study provides novel results indicating that a broad range of cerebrovascular risk factors are associated with PD.

Among the cerebrovascular risk factors that we analyzed, prior stroke carried one of the highest relative risks for subsequent PD. To our knowledge, few large-scale epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between prior stroke and PD. In a nested case-control analysis of a general practice research database in the United Kingdom, a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack was associated with the subsequent diagnosis of PD, and the magnitude of association (odds ratio, 1.65) was higher than that found in our study.43 However, this study did not adjust for time-dependent confounding. By applying marginal structural Cox modeling to a large heterogeneous population, our data build on prior similar reports, strongly indicating that cerebrovascular risk factors and their most extreme phenotype of prior stroke predispose to the development of PD.

Previous pooled analyses have reported an inverse association between cigarette smoking and PD.28 Postulated theories have included possible neuroprotectant effects of cigarette smoke or reverse causality. Interestingly, previous pooled analyses have not found an inverse association between smoking and PD in subjects older than 75 years of age at diagnosis.28 These authors have hypothesized that the reason for these age effects is that smoking may delay rather than prevent the onset of PD. In our study, mean age was 75.9 years, and tobacco use was modestly positively associated (HR, 1.2) with the subsequent diagnosis of PD after adjusting for other cerebrovascular risk factors, demographics, and Charlson comorbidities. We suspect that the reason for this positive rather than negative association between tobacco use and subsequent PD is the older mean age of our cohort. Other possible reasons for this discrepancy include differences in methodological design and analytical technique, and the possibility of frequent misclassification of vascular parkinsonism as idiopathic PD. We believe that the latter explanation is unlikely as we used a validated diagnostic algorithm to identify PD cases and our results were robust across multiple sensitivity analyses, including an analysis which required a neurologist’s diagnosis of idiopathic PD to fulfill diagnostic criteria.

Our findings also confirm the previously described association between cerebrovascular risk factors and subsequent AD.6, 44, 45 Cerebrovascular disease has been shown to share several risk factors with AD, and these risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of AD incidence and progression.2–5, 7, 46 Putative mechanisms for the relationship between cerebrovascular dysfunction and AD include insufficient delivery of cerebral blood flow during neural activity, cerebral endothelial dysfunction, altered cerebrovascular autoregulation as well as impaired vascular clearance of beta-amyloid and, possibly, tau.47 Furthermore, since the magnitude of associations with cerebrovascular risk factors for AD was similar to those for PD, our data raise the question of whether cerebrovascular risk factors could also promote PD pathology. For example, experimental studies indicate that cerebral hypoperfusion promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation.48, 49 Considering that up to 50% of AD patients exhibit alpha-synuclein aggregates,50 the neurovascular dysfunction associated with vascular risk factors could exacerbate PD pathology. In turn, PD pathology could promote cerebral ischemia and stroke. For example, transgenic mice overexpressing alpha-synuclein are more susceptible to experimental ischemic brain injury,48 raising the possibility of a synergistic interaction between ischemic stroke and PD pathology, as suggested for AD.8 These intriguing possibilities need to be explored in future experimental studies and validated in appropriately designed epidemiological investigations.

Our study has several notable limitations. First, we used Medicare claims data for this analysis, and these data lack neuroimaging and neuropathological results; therefore, we are unable to determine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD. Second, we lack information on disease severity, subtypes, and course. Third, our population was restricted to patients greater than 66 years of age; however, most patients with PD and AD are in this age group. Fourth, although we used validated algorithms to identify study exposures and outcomes, our reliance on diagnostic codes could have led to misclassification error, resulting in false or attenuated associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD. This is especially possible because while the PPV of Medicare claims for identifying cerebrovascular risk factors are reported to be greater than 95%, the negative predictive values are reported to be much lower, ranging from 52–91%.34 Similarly, the PPV of the Medicare claims algorithm we used to identify PD diagnoses is reported to be 79% and therefore nondifferential measurement error could have affected the validity of our association analyses.35 We also lacked medication data and therefore could not use prescription information to help classify PD cases. Similarly, by diagnosing PD through claims data, some patients classified as having idiopathic PD may have actually had vascular parkinsonism from strategic infarcts in the basal ganglia or severe periventricular white matter disease, which according to some authors, may occur in up to 2% of patients with PD and may represent a clinically and radiographically distinct entity from idiopathic PD.14, 15 We attempted to mitigate this concern by identifying idiopathic PD cases through a validated algorithm that excluded the diagnostic code for secondary parkinsonism (ICD-9-CM code 332.1), but patients still may have been misclassified, especially in cases of limited diagnostic evaluations. Fifth, our study spanned 7 years with a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Since the biological onset of PD could have occurred several years before its overt clinical manifestation, this amount of time may have been too brief to fully capture the epidemiological relationship between cerebrovascular risk factors and PD. For example, in AD, vascular risk factors in midlife are associated with the disease decades later,6 and a similar relationship could exist also for PD. Similarly, the 1-year run-in period may have been insufficient to capture all previously diagnosed cases of PD.

In conclusion, we found that most cerebrovascular risk factors, particularly obstructive sleep apnea, prior stroke, and heart failure, were associated with an increased risk of subsequent idiopathic PD. These associations were similar to those seen with subsequent AD, another common neurodegenerative disease with a well-known link to cerebrovascular factors. While we were unable to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms in this epidemiological study, our data raise the question of whether a common neuropathological pathway between cerebrovascular risk factors, AD, and PD exists. Since many cerebrovascular risk factors are modifiable, and both AD and PD impose considerable public health burdens, these hypothesis-generating results should prompt translational research efforts to evaluate the effects of vascular disease on the pathobiology of PD.
