The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) of the amygdala plays an important role in the generation of emotional/motivational behavior and the consolidation of emotional memories. Activation of M1 cholinergic receptors (M1Rs) in the BNC is critical for memory consolidation. Previous receptor binding studies in the monkey amygdala demonstrated that the BNC has a high density of M1Rs, but did not have sufficient resolution to identify which neurons in the BNC expressed them. This was accomplished in the present immunohistochemical investigation using an antibody for the m1 receptor (m1R). Analysis of m1Rs in the monkey BNC using immunoperoxidase techniques revealed that their expression was very dense in the BNC, and suggested that virtually all of the pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) in all of the BNC nuclei were m1R-immunoreactive (m1R+). This was confirmed with dual-labeling immunofluorescence using staining for calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for BNC PNs. However, additional dual-labeling studies indicated that one-third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were also m1R+. Moreover, the finding that 60% of parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive neurons were m1R+ indicated that this IN subpopulation was the main GAD+ subpopulation exhibiting m1R expression. The cholinergic innervation of the amygdala is greatly reduced in Alzheimer’s disease and there is currently considerable interest in developing selective M1R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) to treat the symptoms. The results of the present study indicate that M1Rs in both PNs and INs in the primate BNC would be targeted by M1R PAMs.

1. INTRODUCTION

The basolateral nuclear complex (BNC) of the amygdala consist of three main nuclei, the lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei, each of which consists of several subdivisions. Each of the BNC subnuclei have distinctive connections with: (1) discrete cortical areas, including areas in the prefrontal, insular, temporal, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices; (2) specific thalamic nuclei; (3) specific hypothalamic nuclei; (4) basal forebrain; (5) monoaminergic brain stem nuclei; and (5) other amygdalar nuclei (for a recent review see McDonald, 2020). By way of these diverse connections the BNC plays a key role in the generation of emotional/motivational behavior and the consolidation of emotional memories. Several neuromodulators are critical for memory consolidation by the BNC, including norepinephrine and dopamine (McGaugh, 2004, Lalumiere et al., 2004). However, the memory enhancing effects of these neuromodulators requires the additional activation of the muscarinic cholinergic system in the BNC. Post-training infusions of muscarinic cholinergic antagonists into the BNC, or lesions of portions of the basal forebrain cholinergic system projecting to the BNC, produce impairments in several types of emotional/motivational learning including inhibitory avoidance, contextual fear conditioning, conditioned place preference, and drug-stimulus learning (Power et al., 2003a).

Studies in the rat in the 1970’s first demonstrated that the levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine) and acetylcholinesterase (AChase; the catabolic enzyme for acetylcholine) in the BNC were among the highest in the brain (Ben-Ari et al., 1977). Subsequent investigations combining ChAT immunohistochemistry with retrograde tracing demonstrated that the cholinergic basal forebrain, especially the Ch4 group in the substantia innominata, was the main source of these cholinergic inputs to the amygdala in rodents (Mesulam et al., 1983a; Carlsen et al., 1985; Rao et al., 1987). Cholinergic inputs to the rat BNC are extremely dense, especially to the basolateral nucleus, where both pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs) are targeted (Muller et al., 2011).

Cholinergic inputs to the BNC are associated with both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors but most studies of memory consolidation by the BNC utilized muscarinic agonists or antagonists (Power et al., 2003a). Pharmacological studies have found at least 4 muscarinic receptor subtypes (designated by upper case letters as M1–M4), whereas molecular biological techniques have identified 5 distinct subtypes (designated by lower case letters as m1–m5) (Ehlert et al., 1995). These muscarinic receptor subtypes exhibit a differential distribution in the brain and are characterized by specific signal transduction mechanisms (Richelson, 1995). Receptor binding studies in rodents have shown that the BNC contains the two major pharmacologically-defined receptor subtypes, M1 receptors (M1Rs) and M2 receptors (M2Rs) (Cortés and Palacios, 1986; Spencer et al., 1986; Mash and Potter, 1986), as well as putative M3Rs and/or M4Rs (Smith et al., 1991). Activation of both M1Rs and M2Rs in the rat BNC are needed for memory consolidation functions performed by this brain region (Power et al., 2003b).

Knowledge of the cellular and subcellular localization of these receptors in the BNC is critical for understanding the actions of acetylcholine involved in memory. Immunohistochemical studies have investigated the localization of m1 (m1Rs) and m2 receptors (m2Rs) in the rodent BNC (McDonald and Mascagni, 2010, 2011; Muller et al., 2013, 2016; Fajardo-Serrano et al., 2017). The neuronal and synaptic localization of m1Rs in the BNC is of particular interest since the role of these receptors in synaptic plasticity is well documented in other brain regions (Markram and Segal, 1990; Marino et al., 1998; Shinoe et al., 2005; Buchanan et al., 2010; Dennis et al., 2016). Although most studies of the cholinergic innervation of the BNC have used rodents as experimental animals, the basic anatomy of cholinergic inputs to the BNC in primates appears to be similar. Thus, cholinergic inputs to the primate BNC are very dense (Girgis, 1980; Svendsen and Bird, 1985; Amaral and Bassett, 1989) and arise mainly from the Ch4 group of the basal forebrain (Mesulam et al., 1983b; Koliatsos et al., 1988; Kordower et al., 1989). Moreover, studies using receptor binding autoradiography revealed robust expression of M1Rs in the monkey and human BNC (Cortez et al., 1987; Mash et al., 1988). However, these studies did not have the resolution to determine which cell types in the primate BNC expressed m1Rs. This is an important question since it would be a first step it determining whether M1R-mediated mechanisms elucidated in the rodent BNC might also apply to primates, including humans. Therefore, in the present investigation single- and dual-labeling immunohistochemistry was used to study the neuronal localization of m1Rs in the amygdala of the macaque monkey. An antibody to alpha type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) was used to label PNs (McDonald et al., 2002), whereas antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and parvalbumin (PV) were used to label inhibitory INs.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Tissue preparation

These immunohistochemical experiments were performed on amygdala tissue from three macaque monkeys received as a gift from Dr. E. Chris Muly at Emory University, Atlanta, GA. The tissue was obtained from monkeys (Table 1) that had been housed at Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University. Animals were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), and then perfused with one of two fixatives: (1) a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde/0.2% picric acid (Zamboni’s fixative) in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4; PB), or (2) 4% paraformaldehyde in PB (Table 1). No difference in m1R staining was noticed in the monkeys perfused with Zamboni’s fixative versus 4% paraformaldehyde. Likewise, no difference was noted in a previous study of the monkey cortex using both types of fixatives (Mrzljak et al., 1993). Brains were removed, cryprotected in 35% sucrose in PB, frozen, and stored at −80 C until processed for immunohistochemistry. The care of the animals and all anesthesia and euthanasia procedures in this study were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to use the minimum number of animals necessary to produce reliable scientific data.

Upon receipt, brains were thawed in descending concentrations of sucrose in PB, and amygdalae were excised and sectioned at 50 μm in the coronal plane with a vibratome (Leica VT1200; Nussloch, Germany). Before being processed for immunohistochemistry, sections through the amygdala were incubated in 1% borohydride in PB, and then rinsed for 1 h in PB (6 × 10 m rinses). Sections were processed for immunohistochemistry in wells of tissue culture plates. A one-in-ten series of sections through each amygdala was processed for each single- or dual-labeling experiment described below. In addition, a one-in-ten series of sections through each amygdala was Nissl-stained (cresyl violet) so that borders of amygdalar nuclei could be recognized in neighboring sections processed for immunohistochemistry, using blood vessels and fiber bundles as landmarks. Nuclei were identified using the descriptions and photographs of BNC nuclei provided by Price and co-workers (1987). Other amygdalar sections from these monkey brains were used for antibody controls (see below), preliminary antibody dilution tests, or for other studies.

2.2 Immunoperoxidase experiments

Localization of m1Rs was performed using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase (ABC) technique in brains M58 and M102. Sections through the amygdala were incubated in a rabbit anti-m1R antibody (1:800; catalog # M-9808; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA; RRID: AB_260731) for 48 h at 4° C and then processed for the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique using a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:400), and an Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). DAB (3, 3’-diaminobenzidine-4HCl, Sigma) was used as a chromogen to generate a brown reaction product. Antibodies were diluted in 1% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.05 M PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100. Following the immunohistochemical procedures, sections were mounted on gelatinized slides, dried overnight, dehydrated in descending ethanols, cleared in xylene (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and coverslipped with DPX (MilliporeSigma). Sections were analyzed using an Olympus X51 microscope, and digital light micrographs were taken with an Olympus DP2-BSW camera system. Brightness and contrast were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop CS2 software.

2.3 Dual-labeling immunofluorescence experiments

The BNC contains two main classes of neurons that closely resemble their counterparts in the cerebral cortex: 1) glutamatergic pyramidal projection neurons (PNs) that can be selectively stained using antibodies to the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMK), and 2) GABAergic interneurons (INs) that can be selectively stained using antibodies to GABA or its synthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (McDonald and Augustine, 1993; Pitkanen and Amaral, 1994; McDonald et al., 2002; McDonald and Mascagni, 2010). Dual localization of m1R with CaMK or GAD was investigated to determine if m1Rs were expressed by PNs or GABAergic INs, respectively. Following experiments demonstrating m1R/GAD colocalization in the BNC, additional experiments were performed to determine if there was expression of m1Rs in PV+ INs, a GABAergic IN subpopulation that represents about one-third of GABAergic INs in the monkey BNC (Mascagni et al., 2009).

Dual-localization of m1R with CaMK.

Sections from all three brains were incubated for 48 hrs at 4° C in a cocktail of the rabbit anti-m1R antibody (1:200), and a mouse monoclonal anti-CaMK antibody (1:200; # 05–532; MilliporeSigma; RRID: AB_325403). Antibodies were diluted in 1% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.05 M PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100. This low level of Triton X-100 results in more robust CaMK staining than higher levels. Sections were then rinsed in 3 changes of PBS (10 min each), and then incubated for 3 h at room temperature in a cocktail of goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa-546 antibodies (1:400; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) (brains M102 and M60) or a cocktail of goat anti-rabbit Alexa-546 and goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 antibodies (1:400; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) (brain M58). These secondary antibodies were highly cross-adsorbed by the manufacturer to ensure specificity for primary antibodies raised in each species. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and PB (10 min each), mounted on glass slides, and coverslipped using Vectashield HardSet Antifade mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Fluorescence of Alexa-488 (green) and Alexa-546 (red) dyes was analyzed using filter configurations for sequential excitation/imaging via 488 nm and 543 nm channels. Digital images were adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop CS2 software.

Dual-localization of m1R with GAD or PV.

Sections from brains M102 and M60 were incubated for 48 hrs at 4° C in a cocktail of rabbit anti-m1R antibody (1:200, Sigma), and either a mouse monoclonal anti-GAD-67 antibody (1:200; # MAB5406; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA; RRID: AB_2278725), or a mouse monoclonal anti-PV antibody (1:20,000; # 235; Swant, Marly, Switzerland; RRID: AB_10000343). Antibodies were diluted in 1% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.05 M PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100. Sections were then rinsed in 3 changes of PBS (10 min each), and then incubated for 3 h at room temperature in a cocktail of goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa-546 antibodies (1:400; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). Sections were then rinsed in PB, mounted on slides, coverslipped, and examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope as described above.

Analysis of dual-localization immunofluorescence experiments.

In each experiment cell counts were performed in the dorsomedial subdivision of the lateral nucleus (Ldm), the magnocellular subdivision of the basal nucleus (Bmg), and the magnocellular subdivision of the accessory basal nucleus (ABmg) (i.e., from one representative subdivision in each of the three main nuclei of the BNC). In the m1R/CaMK preparations, which used a diluent with 0.05% Triton X-100, immunostaining was confined to the superficial one-third of each section on each of the two surfaces; randomly selected fields were sampled by focusing midway through the depths of the portions of the section that contained immunostaining. In the m1R/GAD and m1R/PV preparations, which used a diluent with 0.4% Triton X-100, immunostaining extended though the entire depth of each section; randomly selected fields were sampled by focusing at a depth that was approximately midway through the section. All neuronal counts were made from images collected at 200X magnification using a 20X objective (Zeiss Plan Apochromat; N.A. 0.75) at an optical section thickness of 3.1 μm. The scanning parameters (pin hole in Airy units [AU], gain, offset) for each preparation were as follows: (1) m1R (1.66 AU, 784, −1.0), (2) CaMK (1.97 AU, 670, −1.0), (3) GAD (1.97 AU, 761, −1.2). (4) PV (1.97 AU, 739, −0.5). All images (and micrographs in this paper) were single optical section scans; no z-stacks were imaged. Neurons were considered double-labeled if green m1R immunoreactivity overlapped with magenta marker immunoreactivity in the merged images; overlapped areas were indicated by yellow. For each nucleus cell counts were made from five to seven 450 μm × 450 μm fields in 3–4 sections in each experiment in each brain. In the m1R/CaMK preparations (brains M58, M102, and M60), counts of single-labeled m1R+ neurons, single-labeled CaMK+ neurons, and double-labeled m1R/CaMK+ neurons were performed. In the m1R/GAD and m1R/PV preparations (brains M102 and M60), cell counts of single-labeled GAD+ or PV+ neurons and double-labeled m1R/GAD+ or m1R/PV neurons were performed. These analyses of dual-localization are considered semi-quantitative since stereological methods were not used.

2.4 Antibody Characterization

The m1R antibody (# M-9808; MilliporeSigma; RRID: AB_260731) was raised in rabbit to a highly purified GST fusion protein of a part of the third intracellular loop of the human m1R corresponding to amino acids 227–353. This part of the third intracellular loop shows virtually no sequence homology with other muscarinic receptor subtypes, but is homologous between species (Bonner et al., 1987). The specificity of this antibody for the m1R has been previously established (Levey et al., 1991; Hamilton et al., 1997). Western blotting demonstrated a protein band that was distinct from other muscarinic receptor subtypes. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that this antiserum only bound the m1R receptor subtype. Preadsorption of the antiserum with the third intracellular loop fusion protein blocked antibody binding. m1R knock outs exhibited no m1R staining, but normal m2R, m3R and m4R staining (Hamilton et al., 1997).

The mouse monoclonal antibody to the alpha type II subunit of CaMK (# 05–532; clone 6G9; Thermofisher, West Columbia, SC; RRID: AB_325403) was raised against purified type II CaMK. This antibody binds with high affinity to purified a-subunit of CaMK obtained from rat brain on Western blots and produces a single line at 50 kDa (Kennedy et al., 1983). It also recognizes a single protein band at 50 kDa on immunoblots of rat brain homogenates (Erondu and Kennedy, 1985). Additional Western blot studies revealed that the antibody recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of the kinase (Erondu and Kennedy, 1985). The GAD-67 antibody (# MAB5406; clone 1G10.2; MilliporeSigma; RRID: AB_2278725) was raised against recombinant his-tag-containing human GAD67 protein in which his-tag is fused with the unique N-terminal region of GAD-67 (amino acids 4–101). It produced staining in the forebrain, including the amygdala, which was consistent with previous studies using GABA antibodies in the monkey (McDonald and Augustine, 1993; Pitkanen and Amaral, 1994). The PV antibody (# 235; Swant; RRID: AB_10000343) is a mouse IgG1 produced by hybridization of mouse myeloma cells with spleen cells from mice immunized with parvalbumin purified from carp muscles. It does not stain the brain of parvalbumin knock out mice (manufacturer’s information).

To examine method specificity in dual-labeling immunofluorescence procedures control sections were processed with one of the two primary antibodies omitted. In all cases only the color of the corresponding secondary fluorescent antibody was observed, and only on the appropriate channel. These results indicate that the secondary antibodies were specific for rabbit or mouse IgGs, and that there was no “crosstalk” between the red and green channels.

3. RESULTS

3.1 Immunoperoxidase experiments

The levels of m1R-ir varied in different nuclei of the monkey BNC (Fig. 1). There was robust staining in the magnocellular and parvicellular subdivisions of the basal (Bmg and Bpc) and accessory basal nuclei (ABmg and ABpc), and lighter staining in the lateral nucleus. At higher power a high density of large pyramidal or piriform m1R-immunoreactive (m1R+) somata, clearly corresponding to PNs, was observed in the BNC, but not in the dorsally-adjacent anterior amygdaloid area (AAA: Figs. 2, 3). It appeared that the somata of virtually every PN in all nuclei of the BNC were m1R+; there appeared to be no unstained spaces that were the size and shape as m1R+ PNs. The staining intensity of PN somata was especially strong in the Bmg, Bpc, and ABmg. In many stained neurons there was a ring of more intense cytoplasmic m1R-ir surrounding the nucleus which appeared to correspond to the location of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi complex (Fig. 3C). Cell nuclei were always unstained.

The neuropil was also m1R+, and its staining intensity seemed to mirror that seen in neighboring PN somata. There were some m1R+ processes that were 2–4 μm in diameter, most likely corresponding to proximal dendrites of PNs. In addition, there was diffuse neuropilar m1R-ir, presumably representing smaller processes whose identity could not be resolved at the light microscopic level of analysis (Fig. 3).

3.2 Dual-labeling immunofluorescence experiments

m1R/CaMK dual-localization.

The pattern of m1-ir in the dual-labeling immunofluorescence experiments appeared to be identical to that seen in the immunoperoxidase preparations, but the neuropilar m1R-ir was more obvious (Fig. 4). The CaMK staining in the BNC was identical to that seen in previous studies of the rat BNC (McDonald et al., 2002; McDonald and Mascagni, 2010). Thus, a high density of large pyramidal or piriform CAMK+ somata, corresponding to PNs, was observed.

Examination of all portions of the BNC in the double-stained sections suggested that virtually all somata of CaMK+ PNs exhibited m1R-ir (Fig. 4). In addition, many small-caliber dendritic processes in the neuropil were double-labeled. Cell counts in the BNC revealed that 95–99% of CaMK+ PNs were m1R+/CaMK+ double-labeled neurons (Table 2). As in the immunoperoxidase preparations, in many CaMK+ neurons there was a concentration of m1R-ir in the perinuclear region of the soma. In some CaMK+ somata m1R-ir was confined to one side of the cell.

m1R/GAD dual-localization.

GAD staining in the BNC in the dual-labeling immunofluorescence experiments was identical to that seen in previous immunohistochemical studies of the monkey BNC using antibodies to GABA (McDonald and Augustine, 1993; Pitkӓnen and Amaral, 1994; Mascagni et al., 2009). Thus, most GAD+ neurons had small to medium-sized ovoid or spherical perikarya, and 2–4 primary dendrites (Fig. 5). Cell counts in the BNC revealed that about one-third of GAD+ neurons in the monkey BNC were m1R+ (Table 3). In general, the levels of m1R-ir were lighter than that seen in CaMK+ PNs. Many GAD+ neurons had a concentration of m1R-ir in the perinuclear region of the soma (Fig. 5A).

m1R/PV dual-localization.

PV staining in the BNC in the dual-labeling immunofluorescence experiments was identical to that seen in previous immunohistochemical studies of the monkey BNC (Pitkӓnen and Amaral, 1993; Mascagni et al., 2009). Thus, PV+ neurons were morphologically heterogeneous, with small, medium-sized or large somata, and 2–4 primary dendrites. Cell counts in the BNC revealed that about 60% of PV+ neurons in the monkey BNC were m1R+ (Table 4). As in GAD+ neurons, the levels of m1R-ir in most PV+ neurons were much lighter than that seen in CaMK+ PNs, and many PV+ neurons had a concentration of m1R-ir in the perinuclear region of the soma (Fig. 6).

4. DISCUSSION

This is the first immunohistochemical investigation to study the expression of m1Rs in the primate BNC. The results demonstrate that the monkey BNC has high levels of m1R-ir. These findings are consistent with M1 receptor-binding autoradiographic studies of the monkey amygdala (Mash et al., 1988), although the latter studies found that binding in the Bmg was lighter than in the accessory basal nucleus (AB), whereas the both the Bmg and the AB had robust m1R-ir in the present study. However, this discrepancy could be explained in part by the fact that the M1 subtype of muscarinic receptor identified using pharmacological techniques corresponds to both m1 and m4 subtypes identified using molecular biological techniques (Bonner et al, 1987; Levey et al., 1991). In the present study the somata of all PNs in all nuclei of the monkey BNC appeared to express m1Rs. In addition, a significant subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the BNC, including PV+ INs, were m1R+; this represents a species difference since virtually no GAD+ IN somata were m1R+ in a previous study of the rat BNC (McDonald and Mascagni, 2010). The similarity in all of the cell counts from the three representative nuclei selected for analysis in this study (one from each of the three main nuclei of the BNC) suggests that similar results might be obtained in all nuclei of the BNC. However, this conclusion awaits future investigation.

4.1 PNs in the monkey BNC express m1R-ir

Previous receptor binding autoradiographic studies of the monkey amygdala (Mash et al., 1988) did not have sufficient resolution to identify which neurons in the BNC expressed M1Rs. This was accomplished in the present investigation using immunohistochemistry for m1Rs. The vast majority of PNs in the BNC, identified by the PN marker CaMK, were m1R+, as in the rat (McDonald and Mascagni, 2010). Likewise, PNs in the neocortex and hippocampus are also m1R+ (Mrzljak et al., 1993; Levey et al., 1995). In general, CaMK was fairly evenly distributed throughout the somata of PNs, whereas the m1R-ir was often concentrated in one portion of somata. Because the optical section thickness was 3.1 μm, and the somata of PNs were much wider, it seems likely that the few single-labeled CaMK+ neurons observed could have been created by the optical section plane intersecting a portion of the somatic cytoplasm that did not contain m1R-ir, thus creating a false negative. Some of the few m1R+ single-labeled neurons observed may correspond in part to GAD+ interneurons (see below).

In addition to cell bodies, m1R-ir was also seen in the neuropil in the BNC. Some of the m1R+ structures appeared to be dendrites, but structures contributing to the more diffuse neuropilar immunoreactivity will require ultrastructural analysis to be resolved. Electron microscopic studies of the rodent BNC have shown that dendritic shafts and dendritic spines of PNs express m1Rs (Muller et al., 2013; McDonald et al., 2019). These structures are also the main postsynaptic targets of cholinergic inputs to the BNC from the basal forebrain (Carlson and Heimer, 1986; Muller et al., 2011). In addition, axon terminals forming asymmetrical (excitatory) synapses or symmetrical (inhibitory or modulatory) synapses are m1R+ in rodents (asymmetrical: 90%; symmetrical: 10%) (Muller et al., 2013; McDonald et al., 2019). Although axon terminals of BNC PNs form asymmetrical (excitatory) synapses, these synapses are also formed by glutamatergic inputs from the cortex and thalamus (LeDoux et al., 1991; Brinley-Reed et al. 1995; Smith et al., 2000; McDonald et al., 2019; Amir et al. 2019). Thus, it is not clear if axon terminals of BNC PNs in the rat or monkey express m1Rs.

Since the M1R is the main muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype in the rat BNC (Buckley et al., 1988; Levey et al., 1991), and most of the m1R immunoreactivity is found in PNs, it seems likely that many of the muscarinic responses observed in BNC PNs are mediated by this receptor subtype. One of the main effects of muscarinic agonists and/or stimulation of cholinergic afferents to the rat amygdala is an increase in the excitability of BNC PNs due to the suppression of several potassium currents (Washburn and Moises, 1992, Womble and Moises, 1992, 1993; Faber and Sah, 2002). In fact, the suppression of the calcium-activated slow afterhyperpolarization current (sIAHP) has been shown to be M1R-mediated in the rat BNC (Washburn and Moises, 1992). On the other hand, activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors can produce hyperpolarization by activating small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels in BNC PNs, following the release of calcium from intracellular stores via activation of the phosphatidylinositol signal transduction pathway (Power and Sah, 2008). Since M1Rs are known to activate the phosphatidylinositol system (Richelson, 1995), this receptor in BNC PNs may mediate this response. In addition, it has been shown that released acetylcholine can produce a long-lasting IPSP in PNs that is mediated by M1Rs coupled to the activation of G-protein-coupled inward rectifier channels (Unal et al., 2015; Aitta-aho, 2018).

Another way in which M1Rs can affect the activity of BNC PNs is by activation of a non-selective cationic conductance (ICAN ; Yajeya et al., 1997, 1999; Egorov et al., 2006; Unal et al., 2015), but this current is state-dependent. Thus, in BNC PNs that are strongly activated, but not in quiescent PNs, activation of M1Rs by optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons activates ICAN, which causes a robust afterdepolarization. It has been suggested that this increases the signal/noise ratio and facilitates mnemonic functions in the BNC by generating a subset of activated PNs that collectively form a memory trace (Han et al., 2007; Josselyn, 2010). In addition, because the M1R-mediated afterdepolarizations lengthen the period of excitation, they might facilitate the formation of stimulus associations even when the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli are not optimally timed (Unal et al., 2015).

4.2 GABAergic interneurons in the monkey BNC express m1R-ir

In the rat BNC (McDonald and Mascagni, 2010), as well as in the neocortex and hippocampus of the rat (Levey et al., 1995; Volpicelli et al., 2004), very few GAD+ somata are m1R+. In contrast, a substantial subpopulation of GAD+ somata (about one-third) and PV+ somata (about 60%) in the monkey BNC expressed light to moderate levels of m1R. PV is expressed in about one-third of GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the monkey BNC (Mascagni et al., 2009). These percentages suggest that PV+ INs are the main GABAergic IN subpopulation in the monkey BNC that expresses m1Rs.

Although very few GAD+ somata in the rat BNC express significant amounts of m1R-ir, it is of interest that electron microscopic studies have demonstrated that dendritic shafts in the rat BNC that receive multiple excitatory synapses, typical of INs containing parvalbumin (Muller et al., 2011), are m1R+ (Muller et al., 2013). In addition, m1R+ axon terminals forming inhibitory synapses with PN axon initial segments, characteristic of PV+ axo-axonic INs, were seen in the rat (see below). These observations suggest that although few PV+ somata in the rat BNC are m1R+, some PV+ INs in the rat are indeed m1R+, and these m1Rs synthesized in the somata are quickly transported to dendrites and axons (Wamsley, 1992). Electron microscopic studies in rat have demonstrated that the somata and dendrites of GABAergic BNC interneurons, including PV+ INs, are innervated by cholinergic inputs (Carlsen and Heimer, 1986; Nitecka and Frotscher, 1989; Muller et al., 2011), although the types of postsynaptic receptors associated with these inputs were not identified. Likewise, there is electrophysiological evidence for muscarinic activation of BNC interneurons, but the receptor subtypes were not determined (Washburn and Moises, 1992; Yajeya et al., 1997).

It seems likely that some m1R-ir in the neuropil of the monkey BNC may correspond to inhibitory axon terminals of local INs. Electron microscopic studies in rat have demonstrated that 10% of m1R+ axon terminals in the BNC form symmetrical synapses. The main postsynaptic targets of these m1R+ axon terminals are somata, axon initial segments, and thick proximal dendrites of PNs, which are the same structures targeted by many GABAergic INs, especially PV and CCK INs (Pitkanen and Amaral, 1993; McDonald et al., 2002, Verecski et al., 2016; McDonald and Mascagni, 2019; McDonald and Augustine, 2020). Although neuromodulatory (i.e., dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, or cholinergic) inputs to the BNC also form symmetrical synapses, their main postsynaptic targets are distal dendrites and spines of PNs (McDonald, 2020). Thus, most of the m1R+ terminals forming symmetrical perisomatic synapses in ultrastructural studies in the rat must belong to local GABAergic INs. This is consistent with electrophysiological studies which have demonstrated that presynaptic M1Rs are responsible for inhibiting synaptically-evoked release of GABA onto PNs in the BNC (Sugita et al. (1991).

4.3 Functional and clinical implications

Activation of M1Rs in the BNC is needed for memory consolidation of aversive events (Power et al., 2003b). The results of the present study indicate that PNs are the main cell type expressing m1Rs in the monkey BNC. This is also true for the rodent BNC (McDonald and Mascagni, 2010), and for the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Levey et al., 1995; Volpicelli et al., 2004), which suggests that there may be similar m1R-mediated mechanisms, including those involved in memory formation, in the BNC of both species, as well as in cortical regions. However, PV+ INs in the BNC also play an important role in emotional memory (Wolff et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2017). Stronger expression of M1Rs in these interneurons suggests differences in cholinergic modulation of mnemonic processes in monkey and rodent.

It is well established that M1R activation can facilitate long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus by potentiating NMDA glutamate receptor (NMDAR) currents (Markram and Segal, 1990; Shinoe et al., 2005; Buchanan and Mellor, 2010; Dennis et al., 2016). Dendritic spines in the hippocampus express NMDARs (Petralia et al., 1994), and there is colocalization of m1Rs and NMDARs in pyramidal neuron (PN) dendrites receiving glutamatergic inputs (Marino et al., 1998). In the BNC the great majority of spines arise from PN dendrites (McDonald and Augustine, 2020). Since about half of dendritic spines of rodent BNC PNs receiving glutamatergic inputs are m1R+ (Muller et al., 2013), and the majority of NMDAR+ profiles in ultrastructural studies of BNC are spines (Farb et al., 1995), it is possible that the role of M1Rs in BNC mnemonic functions also involves potentiation of NMDAR currents in PN spines. In fact, colocalization of m1Rs and NMDARs in dendritic shafts and spines in the mouse BNC was seen in preliminary EM immunohistochemical studies recently performed in our lab (McDonald et al., in preparation).

These findings suggest that therapeutic modulation of M1R-mediated mechanisms in the BNC could be important for treating a number of major neuropsychiatric diseases characterized by impairments in emotional learning, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is a selective loss of cholinergic neurons in portions of the basal forebrain that project to the BNC and cortex in AD (Whitehouse et al., 1981), which results in a 40% reduction in the cholinergic innervation of the BNC (Emre et al; 1993). Moreover, impairments of emotional event memory in Alzheimer’s patients are correlated with the extent of amygdalar degeneration (Mori et al., 1999). In fact it has been suggested that the degeneration of the cholinergic projections to the BNC in AD may be at least as important for the memory disturbances seen in this disorder as the cholinergic projections to the cortex (Kordower et al., 1989; Power et al., 2003a). The symptoms of AD, including memory loss and other cognitive deficits, are currently treated through systemic administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as tacrine and donepezil, that block the breakdown of acetylcholine (Birks, 2006). Although these medications improve cognition in early-stage AD, they can have adverse effects by producing generalized non-selective activation of cholinergic receptors in the CNS and periphery. Therefore, there is considerable interest in developing more selective agents that activate specific muscarinic receptor subtypes. Chief among these agents are M1R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) (Moran et al., 2019). The results of the present study indicate that M1Rs in both PNs and INs in the primate BNC would be targeted by M1R PAMs, unless they could be biased for one cell type (Bradley et al., 2020).

Article highlights

Using antibodies to calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK) as a marker for pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the monkey basolateral amygdala (BNC) it was shown that virtually all PNs in the BNC express type 1 muscarinic receptors (m1Rs). Additional studies indicated that one-third of inhibitory interneurons (INs) expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and 60% of parvalbumin immunoreactive INs (PV) were also m1R+. These results indicate that expression of m1Rs in BNC INs is greater in the monkey versus the rat.
