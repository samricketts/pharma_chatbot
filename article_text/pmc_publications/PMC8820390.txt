Synaptic degeneration is one of the earliest and phenotypically most significant features associated with numerous neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Synaptic changes are also known to be important in neurocognitive disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. Several labs, including ours, have demonstrated that conventional (fluorescence-based) flow cytometry of individual synaptosomes is a robust and reproducible method. However, the repertoire of probes needed to assess comprehensively the type of synapse, pathologic proteins (including protein products of risk genes discovered in GWAS), and markers of stress and injury far exceeds what is achievable with conventional flow cytometry. We recently developed a method that applies CyTOF (Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometry) to high-dimensional analysis of individual human synaptosomes, overcoming many of the multiplexing limitations of conventional flow cytometry. We call this new method Mass Synaptometry. Here we describe the preparation of synaptosomes from human and mouse brain, the generation and quality control of the “SynTOF” (Synapse by Time-Of-Flight mass spectrometry) antibody panel, the staining protocol, and CyTOF parameter setup for acquisition, post-acquisition processing, and analysis.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD) are all proposed to initiate with regional synaptic injury and degeneration (1–6). Despite animal model support for this (7–11), the study of human synaptic changes has been mostly from tissue homogenates, Golgi stains, or electron microscopy. We and others have adapted conventional flow cytometric analysis of human synaptosomes (12–16) and shown that despite using different instruments, samples, and probes, cytometry of human synaptosomes is a reproducible and robust technique. However, this approach has practical limitations on the number of distinct probes that can be used simultaneously. Like cytometry in cancer biology and immunology, the repertoire of probes needed for comprehensive assessment of the type of synapse, pathologic proteins (such as GWAS-discovered risk genes protein), and injury and stress markers far exceeds the limits of conventional flow cytometry.

Cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF) overcomes conventional flow cytometry multiplexing limitations and allows multiplexing of upwards of 20–40 antibodies. CyTOF can give detailed insights into biological complexities that are otherwise difficult, or impossible, to appreciate from the analysis of bulk tissue. Indeed, CyTOF has been used by us and others to great effect in immunology and cancer biology research to reveal cell and tissue diversity (17–26). We recently published a novel method (“mass synaptometry”) using mass cytometry for high-throughput molecular characterization of individual synapses (27). Prior to this, the application of mass cytometry for synaptosome analysis had not been reported, likely owing to the absence of neuroscience-related antibody panels, methods for optimized sample preparation and acquisition protocols, and analytical pipelines for post-acquisition processing. Mass synaptometry offers a new opportunity to gain fundamental insights into early synaptic changes in the brain and nervous system; such molecular signatures may serve as the basis for disease bioassays.

The chapter provides enhanced experimental details for the workflow shown in our recent publication (Figure 1; Figure 2 in (27)). Section 3.1 (yellow in Figure 1) covers proper cryopreservation of tissue from rapid autopsies, or mouse brain tissue, followed by synaptosome preparation, as we described previously (13,14), but with modifications developed by us (27) to adapt the samples for CyTOF. As noted in Figure 1, both brain tissue and synaptosomes can be stored at −80°C. Section 3.2 (represented in Figure 1 with an asterisk) covers considerations for antibody panel design, conjugation of each antibody to a specific heavy-metal ion, and quality control measures to verify specificity of staining.

Section 3.3 (green in Figure 1) describes staining the synaptosomes with a cocktail of antibodies and further processing the samples for mass cytometry. Section 3.4 (blue in Figure 1) covers consideration of acquisition settings, post-acquisition normalization, and gating. This method yields more than 30 parameters for a single synapse multiplied by an average 100,000 synapses per run. Although the complex data analysis required is beyond the scope of this chapter, we include a brief description (Section 3.5) of the analysis tools as a starting point for interested researchers.

2. MATERIALS

2.1. Reagents and disposables

All solutions for mass cytometry should be prepared with ultrapure water. Whenever possible, avoid reagent contact with glass or metal as they are common sources of heavy metal contamination. Please note that standard laboratory dishwashers, autoclaves, and dishwashing detergents are frequently contaminated with heavy metals (particularly barium), which can disrupt experiments or damage the mass cytometer. Use of disposable plasticware is strongly recommended. Use only mass spectroscopy–grade chemicals. Reagents can be tested for heavy metal contamination by running them in “solution mode” on the mass cytometer. In addition, some solutions need to be freshly prepared: dilutions of fixative buffers (Maxpar Fix 1 or 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA)); Cell ID™ Intercalator-Ir and Perm Buffer; and Benzonase.

Care should be used in handling Maxpar Fix I Buffer PFA, as they are toxic; appropriate protective measures (e.g., gloves, eye and respiratory protection) should be employed when needed. Follow all waste handling regulations when disposing of waste materials.

2.4 Brain tissue/biological material

Follow all biosafety and hazardous waste guidelines as per institutional guidelines (see Note 5). Mouse tissue should be collected following appropriate protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Whole mouse brain and/or dissected brain regions can be used as appropriate.

Human brain tissue must be collected following appropriate protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at your institution.

3. METHODS

Perform all procedures on ice unless otherwise specified. For steps involving centrifugation at room temperature (RT), set the centrifuge to 25°C to avoid inadvertent heating of samples.

3.1 Synaptosome preparation

3.1.1 Brain tissue collection and storage:

1. Obtain fresh brain tissue at a human autopsy or immediately after sacrifice of a mouse. The tissue should be ~0.5 cm3. Collected tissue must be kept on ice and processed rapidly (Figure 1; see Note 6).

2. Finely mince tissue using a scalpel on a pre-chilled surface, such as an inverted cell culture dish on ice. Fully minced tissue will look like a slurry and no lumps of tissue should be visible. This is necessary to ensure complete and even cryopreservation. If you intend to proceed immediately with synaptosome preparation, go to Step 4 below.

3. Use the blade to transfer minced tissue to 1.5-ml cryo-tube tube containing 1 ml of RT cryopreservation solution. Mix by brief manual shaking and immediately insert the tubes into the freezing container, which should be at RT. Place the freezing container in a −80°C freezer. After overnight storage (~12 hours), the samples may be transferred to liquid nitrogen or kept at −80°C (see Notes 7 &amp; 8).

3.1.2. Preparation of synaptosomes:

4. Starting with cryopreserved tissue sample from Step 3, transfer rapidly to a 37°C water bath. Once completely thawed, add ice-cold HB to near the top of the tube. Samples should be spun at 4,000 g for 4 min at 4°C. Gently pour off the supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml of HB. Repeat this wash step twice more to remove fully the cryopreservation solution.

5. Transfer tissue from Step 4 or freshly dissected brain tissue from Step 2 into a prechilled glass/Teflon size homogenizer. Based on the weight, add 10 volumes of ice-cold HB and homogenize at 800 rpm with 8 up-and-down strokes over ice.

6. Transfer the homogenate to pre-chilled 2-ml centrifuge tubes and spin at 1,000 g at 4°C for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. The synaptosome-containing supernatant (S1; see Figure 1) should then be transferred (by pipetting) into new pre-chilled centrifuge tubes. The pellet (P1) may be discarded.

7. Centrifuge S1 at 10,000 g for 20 min at 4°C to obtain the crude synaptosome pellet (P2). The supernatant (S2) can be discarded,

8. Resuspend P2 in 1 ml of cryopreservation solution. These samples can again be cryopreserved by cooling slowly as described in step 3 above (see Notes 7 and 8) and stored in liquid nitrogen, or at −80°C (see Note 6). We typically store a starting tissue size of approximately 0.5 cm3 in 5 tubes of 200 μl each (1 ml is divided in 5 tubes); if starting with more material scale up proportionally.

3.2 Modular design and implementation of synaptic antibody panel.

We designed and optimized a SynTOF panel of antibodies (27) that should be widely applicable. Our chief intention, however, was to develop a protocol that would be most useful for research of neurodegenerative conditions. In this section we will briefly describe the reasons for our selection of each modular components of the panel as well as the individual epitopes. This modular design approach should serve as a guide for modifying the panel; specifically optimized techniques or procedures which affect panel performance are noted individually below at the appropriate experimental steps.

3.2.1. Modular organization of controls:

Cell-type markers - used to identify the cellular origin of particles detected by the mass cytometer, as well as interactions between adjacent cellular structures (see Table 1). These markers are also important in the detection of homogenate debris Neuronal markers: CD56, CD298

Non-neuronal markers: CD11b (microglial marker), glial fibrillary astrocytic protein (GFAP; astrocytic marker), myelin basic protein (MBP; oligodendrocyte marker)

Synapse type - used to subclassify individual particles SNAP-25 - SNARE complex protein (general synapse marker)

CD47 - Presynaptic protein

PSD-95 - Postsynaptic density protein (see Note 9)

DAT - Dopamine transporter (marker of dopaminergic elements)

NET - Noradrenaline transporter (marker of noradrenergic elements)

SERT - Serotonin transporter (marker of serotonergic neurons)

TH - Catecholamine biosynthesis (marker of dopaminergic neuron)

VGAT - GABA transporter (marker of GABAergic neurons)

VGLUT1 - Glutamate transporter 1 (marker of glutamatergic neurons)

VGLUT2 - Glutamate transporter 2 (marker of glutamatergic neurons)

Nuclear Controls (negative markers) - used to exclude nuclear fragments that can be distinguished by high signal from DNA intercalators: Ir-191

Ir-193

Discovery Markers - used to characterize synaptosomes for neurodegenerative research: Injury and response: 3-Nitrotyrosine (oxidative damage), 8-OH-Guanosine (oxidative damage), C1q (aging, pruning and inflammation), Caspase 3, cleaved Asp175 (apoptosis), K48-ubiquitin (proteasome), K63-ubiquitin (endocytic trafficking and inflammation), LC3B (autophagy)

AD-risk gene products: ApoE (lipid and Aβ transport, inflammation), BIN1 (endocytic recycling), CD33 (Aβ clearance, microglia activation), CD36 (scavenger receptor), CLU/ Clusterin (aka Apo J) (lipid and Aβ transport, inflammation), INPP5D (aka SHIP1) (inflammation), p-Tau (Ser202, Thr205) (hyperphosphorylated tau), pTDP-43 (hyperphosphorylated DNA binding protein), PTK2B (aka PYK2) (synaptic modulation), T22 (soluble tau oligomer), β-Amyloid, x-40 (Aβ40 pathology), β-Amyloid, x-42 (Aβ42 pathology)

3.2.2 Considerations for selecting and optimizing additional antibodies:

This modular or flexible list of antibodies may be changed to answer questions specific to your experimental hypothesis. We performed systematic QC on conjugated antibodies and SynTOF panel (see Note 10 and (27)). We used stable, non-radioactive lanthanide series metals and conjugation reagents as previously described by us (17,28,29). Metals and conjugation reagents were procured from Fluidigm (South San Francisco, USA). Some metal conjugates are known to provide stronger signal than others in CyTOF, and it is preferable to conjugate these with antibodies against targets with low expression. Since the relative expression of most of our targets on synaptic terminals was not known, we performed pilot experiments to guide pairing of antibodies with metals.

3.2.3 Antibody conjugation:

Antibodies should be carrier protein–free and 100 μg in quantity to be compatible for commercially available conjugation kits (see Note 11).

We use 50–100 μg of purified antibody per reaction of conjugation (see Note 12).

For antibody conjugation with heavy metals, use the Maxpar Antibody Labeling Kit (Fluidigm) and follow the manufacturer’s protocol. We modify the last step and elute with a smaller volume (10–40 μl) of W-buffer to achieve a higher titer of conjugated antibodies.

3.3 Staining synaptosomes for mass synaptometry

This is a multi-day protocol. For convenience, optional pause points are given where possible; it is not advisable to stop at other steps in the protocol. The protocol includes multiple washing steps. Each wash step includes adding 1 ml of appropriate buffer or solution, spinning at 8,000g for 4 min at the indicated temperature, and carefully discarding the resulting supernatant. Following each wash, the pellet is resuspended in the appropriate solution by gently pipetting up and down several times, without causing bubbles.

DAY 1

1. Transfer P2 sample(s) quickly to a 37°C water bath. Once thawed, top off each tube with KRP buffer, if necessary. Wash at 25°C and resuspend the pellet in KRP buffer. Wash twice more with KRP buffer and resuspend the pellet in 800 μl of KRP buffer.

2. Pre-wet a 5-μm Ultrafree-CL-centrifuge filter with 200 μl of KRP buffer. Add the resuspended pellet and spin at 1,000g at 25°C for 4 min. Discard filter and gently transfer the ~1 ml of filtrate into a fresh centrifuge tube (see Note 13).

3. Spin the filtrate at 8,000g at 25°C for 4 min. Discard the supernatant. Resuspend (by pipetting) the synaptosome pellet in 190 μl of KRP buffer.

4. Add 10 μl of Benzonase Nuclease HC (250U/μl), gently mix and incubate for 30 min at 37°C (see Note 14).

5. Wash three times with 1 ml PBS, then spin at 8,000g at 25°C for 4 min.

6. To the pellet, add 1ml of 1x Fix I Buffer in PBS. Mix well by pipetting gently up and down to resuspend the synaptosomes and incubate for 15 min at RT. Do not decrease the volume of fixative or increase the fixative concentration or fixation time. Also do not incubate this step on ice.

7. Wash the fixed synaptosomes twice with 1 ml PBS by centrifuging at 8,000 g, at 25°C for 4 min. Optional Pause point: store fixed synaptosomes overnight in 200 μl PBS at 4°C. This pause may be advisable if multiple samples are to be staining concurrently (see Notes 5 and 15).

DAY 2

8. Wash synaptosomes twice with 1 ml of 1x Perm-S Buffer prepared in PBS.

9. Resuspend in 1 ml 1x Perm-S Buffer and incubate at RT for 30 min (see Note 16).

10. Spin at 8,000g at RT for 4 min and remove buffer. Wash once with 1 ml of Cell Staining Buffer.

11. Dissociate the pellet by pipetting up and down in 500 μl of Cell Staining Buffer. Keep synaptosomes on ice while preparing cocktail of antibodies.

12. Make up a cocktail of antibodies from stocks of individually conjugated labeled antibodies stored in separate tubes. Keep antibodies on ice at all times (see Note 17 and Section 3.2).

13. Using a 0.1 μm centrifugal filter, pre-wetted with 10 μl of Cell Staining Buffer, filter the antibody cocktail, by centrifuging at 1,000g, for 2 min, at RT.

14. To synaptosomes from Step 11, add an additional 500 μl of Cell Staining Buffer. Spin at 8,000g at 4°C for 4 min and discard supernatant (Critical observation: At this point, ensure that the pellet size is approximately equal in all tubes (see Note 15). If pellet size is markedly different between aliquots of the same preparation re-pool the sample and divide again).

15. Add filtered antibody cocktail from Step 13 to the pellet and resuspend by adding Cell Staining Buffer to a final volume of 150 μl (see Note 18).

16. Incubate at RT for 1.5 hour, with occasional gentle mixing.

17. Wash twice with Cell Staining Buffer, followed by two washes with 1 ml PBS (by spinning at 8,000g at RT for 4 min).

18. Fix synaptosomes by resuspending in 990 μl of freshly prepared 1% PFA and incubating at 4°C, overnight (see Note 19).

DAY 3

19. Next morning, on ice add Cell-ID intercalator-Ir-125 μM to final concentration of 125 nM, 10 min on ice (i.e., add 10 μl of 100x in 990 ul, 12 μl 100x stored as aliquots at −20°C).

Option1: Running same day

20. Spin at 8,000g at 4°C for 4 min to remove fixative, and wash once with ice-cold PBS.

21. Wash three times with ice-cold MilliQ water (8,000g, 6 min, 4°C). Be careful not to lose the synaptosome pellet during this wash. The pellet becomes increasingly transparent or glassy. It is normal for the pellet to become smaller in size at this stage; however, it is important to ensure that the pellet is not lost completely. Proceed to Step 26.

Option 2: Freezing for future run

22. Spin at 8,000g at 4°C for 4 min to remove fixative, then wash three times with ice-cold PBS.

23. Mix gently with 1 ml of 10% DMSO in FBS (make multiple aliquots if intend to run multiple times, multiple locations). Immediately place in freezing box and transfer samples to a −80°C freezer, to cool the sample at a rate of −1°C/min, starting at RT (see Note 8).

24. When ready to run, thaw sample quickly at 37°C, add MQ water to make volume 1 ml. Spin 8,000g at 4°C for 4 min to remove supernatant.

25. Wash 3x with cold MilliQ water. Proceed to Step 26.

26. Resuspend the synaptosome pellet in 20 μl MilliQ and store on ice until ready to run on the mass cytometer.

27. In a separate 50-ml tube, dilute EQ four element calibration Beads (Fluidigm) in MQ water, 1:5 dilution. Keep on ice.

28. Take a new 5-ml polystyrene round-bottom tube with cell-strainer cap (Falcon/Corning). Prepare tube for loading on the mass cytometer by diluting approximately 2 μl of synaptosome sample with 3 ml of MQ water containing 2x EQ four element calibration Beads (from Step 27).

3.4 Synaptosome acquisition parameters and processing

3.4.1 Acquisition setting for synaptosomes:

1. Adjust sample with MQ water containing 2x EQ four element calibration beads (Fluidigm) to achieve an acquisition rate of approximately 100-400 events per second.

2. Perform initiation and tuning of the mass cytometer according to manufacturer’s and your facility’s recommendations.

3. Advanced settings used in the acquisition of synaptosomes are minimum event length (10); maximum event length (100) and lower convolution threshold (200) (see Figure 2).

4. Acquire data and save in both .FCS and .IMD formats (see Note 20).

3.4.2 Post-acquisition normalization and gating

5. Normalize mass synaptometry data to beads using Fluidigm CyTOF software (version 6.7.1014 or later) (see Figure 3).

6. Bead-normalized data can be used further for analysis. Depending on downstream processing, these multi parametric and high dimensional data can be saved as .FCS or converted to .txt (which can be opened and saved as .csv or .xls as well).

7. Initial gating and analysis should be done using FlowJo- or CytoBank, a cloud-based computational and machine-learning platform with advanced tools and functionality such as SPADE, viSNE, Citrus, FlowSOM.

8. For synaptosomes, first filter out normalizing beads and DNAhi (nuclear) particles; second filter out non-neuronal events using a CD11b and MBP negative gate; third select for neuronal events using CD56 or CD298; fourth select for presynaptic events using CD47 and SNAP25; fifth gate out “snowmen” using PSD95 (see Notes 9, 21 and 22).

3.5 Advanced analytical tools for high dimensional mass synaptometry datasets

The analysis tools listed here are not exhaustive and are included as a starting point for advanced analysis of synaptosome data.

In principle, data generated is somewhat equivalent to data generated by conventional fluorescence-based flow cytometry, however with far more (30 to 40) analytes detected simultaneously, and without the need for compensation or spectral overlapping. Most of the analytical tools that may be used for analysis of conventional fluorescence-based flow cytometry can also be used therefore with CyTOF data. However due to the high dimensional nature of data generated by CyTOF, the application of computational, statistical tools and algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA), SPADE, viSNE, Citrus, and scaffold are often required.

SPADE and viSNE visualization and analysis includes careful consideration of number of input events, number of nodes, and the number of markers used for clustering to generate SPADE. For proof of principle demonstration for mass synaptometry, we empirically tested by changing nodes from 3 to 500. Choosing fewer nodes leads to insufficient visualization of the diversity of synaptic events, whereas choosing too many nodes for a given number of input events leads to unnecessarily complex trees with near empty nodes. For example, to balance these factors in (27), we selected 50 nodes for 30,000 events per sample for optimal visualization of DAT + events in caudate. For in-depth analysis and interrogation of further marker changes in DAT + cluster, we exported events from the DAT + cluster.

Note 1: The Fluidigm MaxPar® conjugation kit provides a choice of 35 different isotopically enriched 50 mM metal salt solutions ranging from 141 praseodymium to 176 ytterbium using DN3 polymers.

Note 2: Samples should be filtered through a 35 μm (or smaller) cell strainer directly before running on the mass cytometer. This minimizes the risk of clump formation and machine clogging.

Note 3: Composition of homogenization buffer (HB): 0.32 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) with EDTA-free, mass spectroscopy–grade protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma MSSAFE). 1X HB is made by mixing 20 ml of 0.32 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) to 1 vial of MSSAFE. HB must be made fresh on the day of the experiment. We prepare 0.32 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) in bulk, 0.22um filter and store as 50-ml aliquots at −20°C).

Note 4: The description in this section is based on a Helios model mass cytometer (Fluidigm) running software version 7.0.5189.0. Older models (e.g., CyTOF1 and CyTOF2) are suitable but have different mass responsiveness and sample injection rates and may have different sensitivity and software steps.

Note 5: During our optimization and search for a practical solution to achieve equal counts across samples, we tested the following: a Sysmex XN-1000 hematology Analyzer (Sysmex), TC20™ automated cell counter (BioRad), Moxi Flow MXF001, a flow cytometer and cell count/volume Analyzer (Orflo technologies), qNano-nano and micro particles measurement using Tunable Resistive Pulse Sensing (TRPS) technology (Izon Science), and a Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Invitrogen). We also used protein measurement by BCA protein assay before fixation (Pierce/Thermo scientific). We found the Moxiflow counter to be the most pragmatic solution for standardizing counts, especially measurements performed at diluted concentrations. Also see Note 15.

Note 6: Whole mouse brain or specific brain regions may be used. For testing the method, we recommend using whole mouse brain. Human brain samples should be obtained ideally with a postmortem interval &lt; 8 h. Human brain regions (cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and cerebellum) of approximately 0.5 cm3 in size can be collected. Since specific mouse brain regions are relatively small, tissue can be pooled from multiple mice. Please note that P2 derived from approximately 0.5 cm3 of starting tissue material will typically be aliquoted into 5 tubes for cryopreservation.

Note 7: Brain tissue that has been snap-frozen or fixed will not work.

Note 8: This is applicable for preservation of both collected tissue and prepared synaptosomes, well as shipping them to other locations.

Larger freezing containers like CoolCell™ FTS30 accommodate 30 centrifuge tubes, while freezing containers like Mr. Frosty™ Freezing Container, which require isopropyl alcohol, usually accommodate 12–18 tubes. In either case follow the manufacturer’s instructions. It is critical that the freezing container is equilibrated at RT and then gradually cooled with samples in it (−1°C/min to −80°C).

Do not transfer a sample tube directly in −80°,C, liquid nitrogen or dry ice as this will compromise sample integrity. Do not use a pre-chilled freezing container or put tubes in a freezing container which are already at −80°C.

If bulk tissues are collected in large tubes (e.g., 5-, 15- or 50-ml tubes that do not fit standard freezing container for cryopreservation), then wrap tubes in paper towels, place in a small Styrofoam box, which should then be taped at all joints to seal completely. Place this container in −80°C overnight.

These frozen tissues or synaptosome samples can be shipped on dry ice.

Note 9: PSD-95 permits the detection of “snowmen,” i.e., the interaction of pre-synaptic and postsynaptic elements. In our experience, up to 10% of the final synaptosome preparation consists of snowmen.

Note 10: Quality control (QC) of conjugated antibody and SynTOF panel: We undertook four QC steps to ensure the sensitivity and specificity of our SynTOF panel. First, only antibodies with Western blot banding pattern unaltered by conjugation on positive samples were included. Second, we used metal minus (MM) controls, in which synaptosomes were incubated without conjugated antibody to determine background signal in the omitted channel; MM controls also were used to set gates. Third, isotype antibodies were obtained from the same supplier as the primary antibody whenever possible, always from the same host species and Ig subclass, and conjugated with the same metal ion and used at the same concentration as the primary antibody conjugate. Any signal overlapping with isotype control was excluded as non-specific. Lastly, if applicable for the antibody, we use regional variation in synaptic innervation between regions of brain or difference in presence of pathological markers in synaptosome/tissue from pathologically defined versus normal brain.

Note 11: Some antibodies were also custom ordered from vendors or processed by us to remove carrier protein.

Note 12: We scale up conjugation by parallel multiple conjugation reactions—never exceeding 100 μg of antibody per reaction.

Note 13: This 5 μm filtration is critical. For reproducibility we use 5 μm Ultrafree-CL-centrifugal filter devices, spun at 1,000g, at 25°C, for 4 min. Do not use disc filter with manual syringes; we have found it difficult to maintain constant pressure across samples and it results in considerable sample loss. If liquid remains above the centrifugal filter after spinning, it is likely the starting P2 was too large or that there is non-homogenized tissue debris carry-over. Consider using a smaller starting pellet or using multiple filters to avoid clogging. Do not exceed 1,000 g speed.

Note 14: Use high purity, protease-free, pan-nuclease (Benzonase® Nuclease HC, Purity &gt; 99%). This is important to reduce viscosity, preventing multiple synaptosomes flocculating together.

Note 15: Fixed synaptosomes may be divided into multiple tubes depending on experimental plans. Some examples include: (1) titrating antibodies to determine optimal signal; (2) testing different antibody clones with the same metal mass; (3) testing antibody signal with metal minus and isotype controls; and (4) combining different panel antibodies with negative controls. Note that dividing synaptosomes from a single tube into multiple tubes (by volume) should yield an approximately equivalent quantity of synaptosomes. When working with multiple unique samples, it is important to equalize the quantity in each tube (see Note 5).

Note 16: Incubation of synaptosomes with 1x Perm-S Buffer, at RT, for 30 min incubation is critical for non-surface/intra synaptosomal antibody staining to work. We tried permeabilization with cold methanol, triton and/or tween. However we found from our empirical testing that, while these steps improve the staining of some antibodies, others are adversely affected. We have found using 1x Perm-S Buffer, at RT, for 30 min to be optimal for the given panel. We also attempted to use chilled methanol for permeabilization, as this method is frequently used in the preparation of peripheral blood monocytes for CyTOF. However we found that this method leads to considerable synaptosome loss.

Note 17: One can make a ‘master mix’ antibody cocktail to divide them equally, wherever possible, and add additional antibodies in required tubes. Please note that practical volumes may differ slightly from the theoretical total of antibody volume, due to pipetting loss in handling small volumes from multiple tubes. It is a good idea to make an antibody master mix which can be aliquoted and stored in −80°C/LN2 for ready to use. This approach will save time and avoid variability associated with antibody and cocktail preparation (30).

Note 18: Most of the literature suggests the antibody cocktail be added to sample and then add a cell staining quantity sufficient to 100 μl, which makes it easy to calculate final antibody concentration. However, we practically find that when using in-house conjugated and titrated antibodies for synaptic or neurobiology panels (such as our SynTOF panel), the optimal cocktail volume reaches around 70-90 μl at times, even after using a high titer antibody. Therefore, we add Cell Staining Buffer to make final volume to 150 μl. Whatever volume you use, keep this volume constant for given set of samples in experiments where comparisons are intended.

Note 19: Make fresh 1% PFA before each use from new ampoule of 16% PFA (Alfa Aesar). Be careful not to lose the synaptosomes following fixation as the pellet can loosen from the wall and wash off. Avoid decanting supernatants by inverting the tube. It is best to use filter pipette tips to remove buffers from each tube for every following step. Mix to suspend stained synaptosomes by pipetting several times. Do not decrease the volume of fixative below 500 μl or increase the concentration of fixative as it may lead to crowding of synaptosomes that would lead to increase in doublets. Immediately transfer tubes at 4°C, do not keep at RT.

Note 20: Data are collected by default as an .IMD (integrated mass data) file, which generates multiple .FCS (flow cytometry standard) files at the end of the acquisition. It is advisable to save the .IMD file, because it contains all the original data, which can be reprocessed later to generate additional .FCS files after modifying acquisition parameters such as minimum event length, maximum event length, and lower convolution threshold. This post-acquisition processing can be done away from the mass cytometer on computers with CyTOF software.

Note 21: Third and fourth gating filters can be combined to use CD56 and SNAP25 to select neuronal presynaptic events in one step. This may be required if one wants to create space in the panel for their antibody of interest. Please note that standard steps that are used for single-cell analysis used in immuno-oncology were modified and adapted for synaptosome data processing. The gating strategy was adapted and aligned with the panel design for analysis of identification of bonafide synapses using multiple markers.

Note 22: Practically, CD56 and SNAP25 will be sufficient to gate neuronal and synaptosome in one step gating.
