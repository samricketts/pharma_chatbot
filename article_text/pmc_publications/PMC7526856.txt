Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a prominent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ)-containing extracellular plaques, accompanied by a microglia l-mediated inflammatory response, that leads to cognitive decline. Microglia perform many disease-modifying functions such as phagocytosis of plaques, plaque compaction, and modulation of inflammation through the secretion of cytokines. Microglia are reliant upon colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 (CSF1R) activation for survival. In AD mouse models, chronic targeted depletion of microglia via CSF1R antagonism attenuates plaque formation in early disease but fails to alter plaque burden in late disease. It is unclear if acute depletion of microglia during the peak period of plaque deposition will alter disease pathogenesis, and if so, whether these affects are reversible upon microglial repopulation.

To test this, we administered the CSF1R antagonist PLX5622 to the 5xFAD mouse model of AD at four months of age for approximately one month. In a subset of mice, the drug treatment was discontinued, and the mice were fed a control diet for an additional month. We evaluated plaque burden and composition, microgliosis, inflammatory marker expression, and neuritic dystrophy. In 5XFAD animals, CSF1R blockade for 28 days depleted microglia across brain regions by over 50%, suppressed microgliosis, and reduced plaque burden. In microglial-depleted AD animals, neuritic dystrophy was enhanced, and increased diffuse- like plaques and fewer compact-like plaques were observed. Removal of PLX5622 elicited microglial repopulation and subsequent plaque remodeling, resulting in more compact plaques predominating microglia-repopulated regions.

We found that microglia limit diffuse plaques by maintaining compact-like plaque properties, thereby blocking the progression of neuritic dystrophy. Microglial repopulation reverses these effects. Collectively, we show that microglia are neuroprotective through maintenance of plaque compaction and morphologies during peak disease progression.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of diffuse and dense-core extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies lead to eventual cognitive decline. Microglia respond robustly to Aβ pathology and execute pivotal functions during disease progression, most prominently through phagocytic remodeling of Aβ plaques, barrier formation to prevent plaque expansion and development of dystrophic neurites, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Condello et al., 2015; Song and Colonna, 2018).

Microglial survival and proliferation are wholly reliant upon colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) function (Waisman et al., 2015). Administration of antagonists of CSF1R agonists induce rapid apoptotic microglial death, with near complete ablation within a few days (Elmore et al., 2014). Importantly, upon discontinuation of drug treatment, residual microglia robustly proliferate and repopulate the brain, restoring cellular density to normal (Elmore et al., 2015, 2014). The ability to selectively deplete and restore microglia allows for the evaluation of their role in the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (Dagher et al., 2015; Elmore et al., 2014; Olmos-Alonso et al., 2016; Rice et al., 2017; Spangenberg et al., 2016). Using CSF1R antagonists to deplete microglia produced seemingly contradictory results in AD mouse models with respect to plaque burden and was found to be influenced by disease. Treating during late disease stages did not alter plaque burden, whereas sustained administration early in disease nearly eliminated plaque burden. This suggests that microglial depletion influences plaques and AD pathology differently depending on how far the disease has progressed (Sosna et al., 2018; Spangenberg et al., 2019, 2016). There is a lack of consensus on whether microglia are protective or detrimental in AD progression.

To determine whether microglia depletion influences AD pathology, we eliminated microglia during the period after peak neuronal loss in the 5XFAD mouse model using PLX5622. Here, we present evidence that microglia are required to preserve the majority of plaques in compact-like morphologies. Moreover, this plaque phenotype is associated with arrest of dystrophic neurite development in an AD mouse model. Removal of PLX5622 permits microglia repopulation and subsequent plaque remodeling towards more compact-like morphologies.

Our findings suggest that CSF1R signaling is essential for microglia to confer neuroprotection during the period of robust AD progression in the 5XFAD mouse model. We also confirm a reduction in plaque burden with CSF1R blockade as others have reported; however, this could be explained by changes in overall plaque composition as a consequence of microglial depletion. These data contribute to a refined understanding of microglial involvement in AD progression and inform future studies into microglial-targeted therapies in AD.

Materials and Methods

Animals.

We used 5xFAD mice which express five human familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations driven by the mouse Thy1 promoter (Oakley et al., 2006) (The Jackson Laboratory [B6SJL-Tg(APPSwFlLon, PSEN1*M146L*L286V)6799Vas, Stock #34840-JAX]).

PLX5622 animal treatment study design.

PLX5622 was provided by Plexxikon formulated in AIN-7 diet at 1,200 mg/kg. At 4 months of age, either normal rodent diet or PLX5622-containing chow was administered for 28 days. An additional cohort of 4-month old mice were treated with PLX5622 or control diet for 28 days, then discontinued from PLX5622 feed and treated with a normal rodent diet for an additional 28 days. At 6 months of age, this cohort of mice was euthanized, and molecular analyses were performed. Experiments always used littermate controls, and both sexes of animals were used. For all immunohistochemistry analyses, the sexes of the animals analyzed for each group are indicated in the figure legends. For representative images, male mice are shown in Figures 1, 2, 4, and 5, and female mice are shown in Figure 3.

Collection of tissue and tissue homogenization.

Following treatment, animals were euthanized, the brain was removed, and the cortex and hippocampus were dissected separately and flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C until analysis. For molecular analyses, the brain was homogenized in tissue homogenization buffer as previously described (Casali et al., 2015).

Immunostaining, image acquisition, and image analysis.

Brains were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Following overnight fixation, brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4°C and embedded. Brains were processed on a cryostat as 30 μm free-floating sections. For immunostaining, at least three matched brain sections spanning the hippocampus were used. Free-floating sections were washed and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton in PBS (PBST), followed by antigen retrieval using 10 mM sodium citrate at 85°C for 15 minutes. Sections were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were incubated in 5% normal donkey serum in PBST overnight at 4°C: Iba1 (Wako #019–19741 in rabbit, 1:1,1000; or Abcam 3456 in goat, 1:1,000); 6E10 (BioLegend #803001 in mouse, 1:1,000; AB_2564653); N-terminal APP (Millipore, #MAB348, clone 22C11 in mouse, 1:1,000), and Ubiquitin (Thermofisher #PA1–10023 in rabbit, 1:2,000; AB_1088148). Sections were washed and visualized using respective species-specific AlexaFluor fluorescent antibodies (diluted 1:1,000 in 5% normal donkey serum in PBST for 1 hour at RT). Sections were counterstained and mounted onto slides. For thioflavin-S (ThioS) staining (Sigma, #T1892), sections were dried at room temperature, rehydrated in PBS, and stained in 0.1% volume TS solution for 5 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then washed twice for two minutes each in 70% ethanol, washed again in PBS, and then mounted. Images were acquired on a fluorescent microscope with similar exposure and gains across stains and animals.

Images were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH). To determine immunoreactive area, we used ImageJ’s ‘threshold’ function. Thresholds were then adjusted manually. Immunoreactive area was determined using the ‘measure’ function and averaged per region to determine the percentage of immunoreactive coverage. Microglia counts were performed using the ‘analyze objects’ function after manual threshold applied as mentioned above, and mask was applied to the images. For plaque morphology analysis, plaques that were 6E10+, ThioS+, or both 6E10+/ThioS+ were counted manually. All plaque numbers were then totaled, and each plaque type was represented as a percentage of total plaques. For all applicable quantifications, physical area in square millimeters was determined using the ‘measure’ command of ImageJ for each region. Quantification is represented as either percent coverage (immunoreactivity) or count per square millimeter. For all immunoreactive coverage, count, and plaque morphology analyses, images were quantified by a blinded observer.

Extraction of Aβ and Aβ ELISA.

Aβ species from brain homogenates were isolated as previously described (Casali and Landreth, 2016). Briefly, homogenates were sequentially extracted for soluble proteins (using DEA solvent) and insoluble proteins (using formic acid) using high-speed centrifugation. For Aβ ELISAs, the anti-Aβ antibody (6E10), Aβ 1–40 HRP, and Aβ 1–42 HRP-conjugated antibodies were all from BioLegend (#803017, # 805407, and #805507, respectively). Total Aβ levels were normalized to total protein levels (represented as ng Aβ/mg protein.

RNA isolation and quantitative, real-time RT-PCR.

RNA was extracted from homogenized tissue using PureLink RNA Mini Columns following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA set. Prior to quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR), cDNA was pre-amplified using specific probes from TaqMan. Taqman MasterMix and StepOne Plus (Applied Biosystems) was used for qPCR as per the manufacturer’s instructions. For all mRNA analyses, housekeeping genes GAPDH and 18S were used. Results are represented as relative fold change in gene expression normalized to the wild-type calibrator (represented as a dashed line in most figures). For statistics, the relative delta Ct method was used (Cameron et al., 2012).

Statistics and study analysis.

Statistical tests, along with the number of animals analyzed, are indicated in the figure legends. Comparisons between two groups were conducted with the unpaired, two-tailed student’s t-tests, and comparisons between multiple groups were conducted with the one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc multiple comparison test. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), except for qPCR results, which show 95% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was met when the p-value was less than 0.05.

Results

CSF1R inhibition depletes microglia and reduces plaque burden

CSF1R antagonists rapidly deplete microglia from the brain and alter disease pathogenesis in a stage-specific manner (Elmore et al., 2014; Spangenberg et al., 2019, 2016). However, the impact of microglial depletion during the period in which plaque deposition is most robust has not previously been assessed. We treated 5XFAD mice with CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (subsequently referred to as PLX) at 4 months of age (Figure 1A). At this age, there has been significant neuronal death in the subiculum, as well as robust amyloid deposition in other brain regions that is accompanied by microglial-mediated inflammation throughout the brain (Oakley et al., 2006).

As expected, PLX treatment significantly depleted microglial numbers in all brain regions analyzed (Figure 1B and C) in 5XFAD mice and their wild-type littermates (WT; data not shown). Overall, microglial depletion was greater than 50% across brain regions, similar to the magnitude of microglial depletion that others have demonstrated using older 5xFAD animals (Spangenberg et al., 2016). The efficacy of PLX-induced microglial depletion varied between brain regions: Subiculum depletion was 30%, hippocampus was 50%, and cortical and thalamic was 70%. Despite incomplete depletion, microgliosis was reduced in PLX-treated animals relative to control-treated 5XFAD mice (Figure 1D).

Surprisingly, assessment of deposited amyloid using the 6E10 antibody (which detects intraneuronal APP/Aβ, diffuse, as well as dense-core Aβ plaques) in the thalamus was diminished following microglial ablation. Similarly, plaque burden in the cortex was reduced at a level approaching statistical significance (p=0.05; Figure 1E). Progressive plaque accumulation begins in the cortex at approximately two months of age, along with other brain regions (Oakley et al., 2006); however, PLX did not alter plaque burden in the hippocampus or subiculum. At two months, hippocampal plaques are emerging, whereas the subiculum exhibits extensive and accelerated plaque development between two to five months of age accompanied by substantial neuronal loss (Oakley et al., 2006). Assessment of Aβ isoforms from soluble and insoluble extracts using ELISAs did not reveal significant changes in PLX-treated animals (Supplementary Figure 1). However, the differences of plaque deposition kinetics could explain changes in plaque burden due to microglial depletion. Nonetheless, CSF1R inhibition in 5xFAD mice significantly reduces microglial reactivity and numbers, along with diminishing plaque burden.

Inflammatory cytokines and transcripts associated with microgliosis are suppressed following CSF1R microglial depletion

Since we observed significant reductions in microglial numbers and microgliosis following PLX treatment, we investigated whether the brain exhibited changes in inflammatory gene transcripts. Compared with WT control-treated animals, cortical mRNA analysis in control-treated 5XFAD animals revealed significant upregulation of microgliosis markers (Iba1, Trem2, and Csf1r) and cytokines (Tnfa, Il6, and Il1b) (Figure 1F). All transcripts associated with microglial activation and cytokines were markedly downregulated with PLX-treatment. The minimal impact of PLX treatment on astrocytosis is consistent with the literature (Shi et al., 2019). Nonetheless, CSF1R inhibition therefore depletes microglia and suppresses their reactivity, and curtails brain proinflammatory cytokine production.

Microglia depletion enhances markers associated with neuritic dystrophy

We noted a paradoxical reduction in plaque burden following ablation of microglia as microglia are well-documented to phagocytose plaques (Clayton et al., 2017; Condello et al., 2018) We investigated whether Aβ-induced neuronal pathology was altered by monitoring dystrophic neurites. Targeted depletion of microglia using CSF1R antagonists attenuates neuronal loss in AD mice, depending on age at treatment (Spangenberg et al., 2016). Both ubiquitin (Ub) and n-terminal APP (nt-APP) accumulate in dystrophic neurites proximal to plaques (Cheng-Hathaway et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2018), and we assessed whether the expression of these markers was altered with microglia depletion along with dense-core plaque marker ThioS. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that there were significant increases in Nt-APP and Ub coverage in the CX and HP of microglia-depleted animals (Figure 2B), with statistical trends towards elevation of Ub in the SUB and THAL.

We measured transcript levels of genes associated with microglial homeostasis, which are broadly neuroprotective in neurodegenerative disease models (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Krasemann et al., 2017). The majority of these markers, with the exception of Apoe, were downregulated in the cortex following microglia depletion in PLX-treated 5XFAD mice (Figure 2C). Thus, CSF1R-depletion-resistant microglia downregulate genes associated with neuroprotection, and depletion of microglia enhances neuritic dystrophy.

Microglia depletion leads to changes in overall plaque morphologies and properties

Microglia form barriers at the plaque interface to impede its growth and expansion (Condello et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016). Perturbation of microglial receptors that control their activation and proliferation (such as TREM2) leads to structural changes in plaques due to compromised microglial clustering and barrier functions (Condello et al., 2018). Microglia numbers and microgliosis were substantially reduced in PLX-treated animals. Furthermore, we observed alterations in plaque burden in PLX-treated animals. We speculated that the enhanced ratio of plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy was due to a shift in plaque organization and compaction as a direct result of CSF1R -mediated microglial depletion, impacting nearby neurites.

To comprehensively survey plaque morphologies, we performed dual staining using 6E10 and ThioS. We scored plaques as either 6E10 positive (‘diffuse/filamentous’ plaques), ThioS positive (dense-core plaques), or 6E10/ThioS double positive (‘compact plaques’), and quantitated these plaques among the total plaque load (Condello et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016). In control-treated 5xFAD mice, most of the plaques in each brain region were either 6E10+ or 6E10+/ThioS+ (Figure 3). ThioS+ plaques represented, on average, approximately 10% of total plaque burden. The relative distribution of plaque types shifted in each brain region following microglial ablation. PLX treatment significantly decreased total plaque burden in the cortex, hippocampus, and subiculum, represented as the percentage of 6E10+/ThioS+ plaques, trend (Figure 3B). Interestingly, PLX treatment significantly increased the percentage of 6E10+ plaques in the subiculum, with a similar trend in the cortex and hippocampus (Figure 3B). Notably, the percentage of ThioS+ plaques was not altered with microglial depletion. Thus, microglia are required to promote the shift of plaque burden from diffuse to compact-like plaques.

Microglial rapidly repopulate upon PLX withdrawal resulting in elevated plaque burden

The observed pathology likely depends on microglia numbers, since CSF1R blockade significantly depleted microglia in all brain regions. Furthermore, our previous results raise the possibility that CSF1R signaling in microglia can result in rapid modification of plaque pathology. We hypothesized that discontinuing PLX treatment would reverse these effects, and switched a subset PLX-treated to the control diet after 28 days, for an additional 28 days (Figure 4A).

Animals treated for 28 days with control diet, and then maintained on control diet for another 28 days (5xFAD+CTL&gt;CTL) showed robust microgliosis, with an increase in microglia numbers and Iba1 immunoreactivity (Figure 4B and C). Iba1 immunoreactivity in 5xFAD animals treated with PLX-diet for 28 days and then switched to control diet (5xFAD+PLX&gt;CTL) largely was comparable to that of 5XFAD+CTL&gt;CTL animals in the hippocampus, subiculum, and thalamus (Figure 4D). Cortical microglia numbers and microgliosis were reduced in PLX-discontinued animals (Figure 4D), consistent with previous reports (Spangenberg et al., 2019). Plaque coverage as measured by 6E10 immunoreactivity was also similar between control-maintained and PLX-discontinued animals in all brain regions (Figure 4E). In summary, plaque burden in PLX-discontinued animals returns to levels observed in mice treated with control chow. We found that microglia repopulate in most brain regions within a month following drug discontinuation, with the notable exception of cortical microglia, whose repopulation and increase in Iba1 immunoreactivity lag behind those of control animals.

Removal of CSF1R inhibitor largely reverts microglial activation markers and cytokine levels

In all brain regions except the cortex, microglia repopulated to densities similar to that of control-maintained animals following removal of the CSF1R inhibitor. To determine whether cytokines and microglial activation markers changed in CSF1R-discontinued animals, we analyzed transcripts for those markers at the mRNA level in the cortex. In PLX-discontinued animals, microglial activation markers and cytokine expression levels reverted to those of control-treated animals (Figure 4F) nearing statistical significance in Il-6 expression. Thus, even though microglial numbers were suppressed in PLX-discontinued animals, microglial activation markers and cytokines at the mRNA level reverted to that of control-treated 5XFAD animals.

Plaque morphologies revert to control levels upon microglial repopulation

Next, investigated the effect of PLX-withdrawal-associated microglial repopulation on neuritic dystrophy, measuring coverage of Nt-APP and Ub. With the exception of the cortex, we observed no significant changes in coverage of these markers (Figure 5A and 5B). The expression of microglial homeostatic genes was unchanged following PLX-discontinuation; notably, several genes remained downregulated (e.g. Tgfbr1, Axl, and Mertk; Figure 5C).

In PLX-discontinued animals, hippocampal and subicular 6E10+ and 6E10/ThioS double-positive plaque species returned, with similar trends occurring in the thalamus (Figure 5D and 5E). Single-positive ThioS plaques were mostly unchanged with inhibitor withdrawal, apart from in the thalamus, where ThioS+ plaques were significantly decreased. Cortical plaque species were the exception with statistical trends towards increases in 6E10+ plaques and significant decreases in 6E10/ThioS double-positive plaques (Figure 5E), most likely due to an incomplete repopulation (relative to control animals) of microglia despite removal of the CSF1R antagonist (Figure 4C). Overall, in regions where microglia have repopulated to control levels, microglia encourage the remodeling of plaque types towards compact-like structures and limit neuritic dystrophy.

Discussion

Microglia play pivotal roles in the central nervous system and execute critical functions during development, aging, and disease. Microglia are the primary arm of the brain’s innate immune system. In AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, microglia secrete cytokines, phagocytose Aβ plaques, and physically restrain the expansion of plaques to protect nearby, healthy neurites (Condello et al., 2015; Song and Colonna, 2018). Recently, GWAS studies have associated a number of microglial genes with elevated AD risk (Efthymiou and Goate, 2017), suggesting a critical role for the innate immune response in disease pathogenesis (Song and Colonna, 2018).

Microglia limit plaque expansion by remodeling plaque morphology by phagocytic trimming amyloid fibrils that extend from the plaque core, leading to plaque compaction. The microglia envelop the plaque with their processes, forming a physical barrier, blocking accumulation of neurotoxic, soluble Aβ42 to regions devoid of microglial coverage (Condello et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016). Here, we show that microglia depletion results in plaque morphology changes. Since microglia constrain plaque expansion through formation of a physical barrier and phagocytosis of amyloid fibrils at the plaque edges (Condello et al., 2018), we postulate that CSF1R provides the necessary proliferation and activation signals in microglia to orchestrate barrier formation and plaque compaction (see model, Figure 6). Microglia become defective at fibrillar Aβ plaque clearance, but more readily clear soluble Aβ species (Condello et al., 2015). Indeed, nearly all brain regions where plaque species shifted from compact to diffuse-like plaques showed significant reductions in microglial numbers following inhibitor treatment. Accordingly, the shift in majority of plaque types was correlated with enhanced neuritic dystrophy, which is in line with other findings which implicate diffuse plaques as instigators of dystrophic neurite formation (Condello et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2016).

In PLX-treated animals, the reduction in overall 6E10 plaque burden was paradoxical for several reasons. First, others have demonstrated that CSF1R blockade does not impact plaque burden at later ages, despite substantial microglial depletion (Spangenberg et al., 2016). Second, removal of microglia, the chief cel responsible for phagocytic clearance of Aβ in the brain, should theoretically worsen, not ameliorate, plaque burden. The first point could be reconciled by the fact that we administered drug at an age substantially younger than Spangenberg and colleagues who did not observe plaque burden changes (i.e.: 4 months in our study versus 10 months in the other study (Spangenberg et al., 2016)). Importantly, overall plaque species may change as a consequence of microglial depletion, which could theoretically produce reduction of individual plaque species (Figure 6).

It has been argued that microglia, or products they release, are detrimental during certain stages of AD progression (Parhizkar et al., 2019; Sosna et al., 2018; Spangenberg et al., 2019; Venegas et al., 2017). In one study, microglia depletion prior to plaque formation in 5XFAD mice resulted in reduced parenchymal plaque deposition at 4 and 7-months of age; however, this was accompanied by enhanced cerebral amyloid angiopathy formation (Spangenberg et al., 2019). We did not observe this phenomenon, likely due to PLX treatment after substantial plaque formation (data not shown). This suggests that microglia have differential effects on plaque dynamics depending on overall plaque burden. Furthermore, the impact on plaque burden due to microglial depletion appears to be influenced by disease progression and/or duration of inhibitor administration in AD mouse models. Administration of the less-selective PLX3997 to two month old 5XFAD mice for three months remarkably inhibited of plaque formation (Sosna et al., 2018). This study also posited that microglial-mediated CSF1R signaling staves off formation of neuritic plaques, without affecting preexisting plaques. Another recent study showed a similar outcome with PLX5622 in a similar time frame (Spangenberg et al., 2019). In contrast, we found that microglia affect plaque burden and that attenuation of their numbers influences plaque morphologies during peak pathological progression. We observed a stark shift from compact to diffuse- like plaque species. This implies that microglia alter formed plaque structure themselves, or diffuse Aβ species in immediate plaque vicinities, at this stage of AD progression (Figure 6).

In 5XFAD animals, microglia exhibit downregulated CSF1R during disease progression (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). The majority of plaque-associated microglia have downregulated CSF1R, whereas distal microglia do not (Krasemann et al., 2017). Plaque-distal microglia are likely recruited to plaques to limit plaque expansion during disease progression (Figure 6). This function requires CSF1R-mediated signaling and activation. Our data indicate that remaining microglia remain in a state of diminished activation and reduced homeostasis relative to AD control-treated mice (Figures 1 and 2). CSF1R may provide the necessary signals for microglia to mitigate disease progression, as is the case with other microglial-specific receptors (Krasemann et al., 2017; Mazaheri et al., 2017). Accordingly, microglial depletion by inhibiting CSF1R may also compromise essential functions related to neuronal protection, such as blocking neuritic dystrophy and maintaining plaque barriers, during peak pathology progression in AD mice.

Various genetic and pharmacologic methods revealed that microglia readily repopulate upon removal of the depletion signal. Consistent with past findings, microglia repopulated in most brain regions following PLX removal, and these microglia ameliorated neuritic dystrophy. This finding was consistent with our observed changes in plaque species within brain regions. Specifically, double-positive 6E10/ThioS plaque morphology reverted to that of control levels, with similar trends in single-positive 6E10 plaques (Figure 6). Cortical plaques did not show this pattern and neuritic dystrophy was still pronounced relative to control levels, since microglia numbers failed to repopulate following PLX withdrawal. Cortical microglia may require a longer ‘release’ time from CSF1R blockade to restore microglial numbers to control levels, as others have shown (Spangenberg et al., 2019).

It is interesting that microglia in the cortex did not fully repopulate, but it is possible that the microglial heterogeneity, or regional availability of CSF1R ligands, across brain regions could explain this delayed repopulation. Along these lines, others have shown there is significant heterogeneity in microglia gene-expression profiles throughout the brain (Masuda et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2019). It is of particular interest to determine if repopulated microglia continue to execute similar functions during pathological progression, or if these repopulated microglia display different gene signatures or surface proteins that could be amenable to microglial-specific therapeutics in a disease context. Indeed, another study demonstrated that repopulated microglia selectively upregulated genes associated with scavenger-related proteins, such as Cd36, and cell-cycle checkpoint proteins, such as Cdk1, compared to non-depleted microglia (Huang et al., 2018). Using a similar microglia-depletion paradigm, another group showed that repopulated microglia utilized Il-1 signaling (Bruttger et al., 2015). Although neither of these studies investigated microglia-repopulation in an AD context, repopulated microglia could represent a fruitful avenue for design and implementation of targeted therapeutics.

Conclusions

Microglia mitigate AD pathology by regulating compact plaques and delimiting diffuse-like plaque expansion (Figure 6), which could provide a neuroprotective mechanism in the 5xFAD mouse model. Microglia repopulate following removal of CSF1R antagonists and execute similar disease-mitigating functions. Whereas others argue that microglia are detrimental prior to plaque deposition, our results strongly suggest a protective role for microglia in peak disease progression in an AD mouse model. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of fine-tuning our understanding microglial biology during neurodegenerative disease progression.

Figure 6: Model for the rapid and reversible CSF1R mediated modification of plaque burden by microglia.

Microglia proliferate and become activated upon encountering plaques, secreting cytokines and chemokines which recruit plaque-distal microglia. Collectively, these actions enable microglia to encircle and maintain plaques in a compact, 6E10+/ThioS+ state through formation of a barrier. Upon blockade of CSF1R signaling, microglia undergo apoptosis both around and near plaques, which compromises barrier maintenance. Plaque populations shift from overall compact-like to 6E10+ plaques. Removal of CSF1R blockade rebalances microglial numbers, dystrophy, and plaque species in most brain regions.

Highlights

After plaque formation, depletion of microglia reduces plaque burden.

Microglia or CSF1R-signaling promote the shift of diffuse to compact plaques.

Microglia remodel existing plaques where they repopulate.

Microglia are required to maintain plaque morphologies during peak pathology.
