Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and heart failure with preserved fraction (HFpEF) are common age-related disorders that can coexist. AD, the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia, affects more than 24 million patients worldwide, including 5.5 million in the US. Alarmingly, the prevalence of AD is expected to triple by 2050 due to aging of the population with a prevalence as high as 10% of individuals over 70 years of age (1). Amyloid plaques, composed of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, and neurofibrillary tangle, composed of abnormally hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau, constitute the hallmark of AD pathology. Composition of amyloid plaques differs depending on their form – neuritic plaques contain Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, while diffuse plaques are composed mainly of Aβ42. Aβ40 and Aβ42 fragments that are generated from the abnormal cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and deposited in the brain parenchyma, resulting in neuronal cell death. On the other hand, more than half the cases of HF are in the setting of a preserved EF. Wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is increasingly being recognized in older adults, as a cause of HFpEF, accounting for 13% of HFpEF (2) and is present in about 25–30% of septuagenerians and octagenerians at autopsy (3). While Aβ deposition in the brain and ATTR in the heart are both age-related disorders of protein-misfolding, the relationship between AD pathology and ATTR is not well defined.

It has been previously observed that elderly AD patients have subclinical heart disease including aortic valve thickening, aortic regurgitation, and left ventricular wall hypertrophy. In a case-control study, Çalik et al. (4) reported reduced diastolic function and increased aortic stiffness in AD patients compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Similarly, another case-control study (5) found reduced LV ejection fraction and cerebral blood flow velocities in AD patients compared to cognitively normal age- and sex-matched controls. Notably, subjects were excluded if they had HF, cardiomyopathy or atrial fibrillation. Intriguingly, Troncone et al. (6) demonstrated that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are present in the cardiomyocytes and interstitium in the heart of patients with AD, and are associated with diastolic and myocardial dysfunction, raising the novel hypothesis that Aβ could play a role in cardiac dysfunction in AD patients. These studies suggest that not only can the status of the cardiovascular system influence the onset or progression of AD, but that AD itself may be a contributing factor to diminished cardiovascular function. Such data suggest that AD is a multi-organ, systemic disorder not limited to the brain and raise the possibility that treatment strategies for ameliorating amyloidosis could be beneficial for both AD and HF.

In this issue of JACC Heart Failure, Sanna et al. present further evidence for abnormal cardiac function in AD patients lacking symptomatic cardiovascular disease. In this cross-sectional case-control study of 32 patients with AD and 34 age- and gender-matched controls, the authors employed standard cardiovascular procedures (electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) to characterize the structural and functional cardiac abnormalities in AD. Compared to controls, AD patients had greater interventricular septum and maximum wall thickness, accompanied by a high prevalence of diastolic dysfunction (70% vs. 35%). Furthermore, low-voltage QRS complexes were more prevalent (28% vs. 3%) as was lower total QRS score (96.5 vs. 111.6 mm) and lower voltage to LV mass ratio (2.32 vs. 2.76 mm/g/m2.7) in AD patients compared to controls. Common causes of low QRS voltage and/or diastolic dysfunction (obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were similarly distributed between the two groups. Although the echocardiographic findings of increased diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular wall thickness may have been anticipated based on previous literature (4–6), the authors are the first to report lower electrocardiographic QRS voltages and voltage/mass ratios in AD patients relative to cognitively normal participants. These are hallmark features of an infiltrative cardiomyopathy such as amyloidosis. Collectively, these findings have raised several important, yet unanswered questions.

Are there clinically significant amounts of amyloidosis present in the hearts of patients with AD?

The data from Troncone et. al (6) clearly demonstrate, albeit in a small population, that Aβ fragments are present in the hearts of patients with AD, but are at much lower concentrations than that seen in the brain in AD. Whether such deposits result in amyloidosis that is of sufficient magnitude to account for cardiac dysfunction is yet unknown. Aβ deposition in the brain precedes the onset of clinical AD by 10–15 years. High Aβ levels in the brain can be detected in the CSF or on PET imaging. Low CSF Aβ 1–42 levels and high tau or high uptake of amyloid and tau tracers in the brain on PET imaging can detect the biomarker signature of AD and implicate specific proteins involved in AD. A similar approach in HFpEF could assist in identifying commonalties between those involved in AD. In that regard, cardiac PET imaging with 11C-PIB, 18F-florbetapir and 18F-florbetaben can also identify cardiac amyloidosis from both light chain and transthyretin amyloidosis early in the course of the disease and may be useful for quantifying the load of amyloidosis over time. Leveraging such methods to image the heart either simultaneously with a PET of the brain performed in a patient with cognitive dysfunction and suspected AD or with a dedicated cardiac PET in this population would answer the question of whether amyloidosis is present in the hearts of patients with AD.

If amyloidosis is present in the hearts of patients with AD, is the precursor protein Aβ, TTR or some other misfolded amyloidogenic protein?

Based on nuclear scintigraphy, cardiac amyloidosis is overwhelmingly due to transthyretin deposits. ATTR amyloidosis was prevalent in 13% of patients hospitalized for HF with preserved ejection fraction and LV wall thickness &gt;12 mm (2); 16% in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis (7); in 5% in patients with presumed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (8) and in 1–3% of subjects &gt; 75 years of age (9). Could ATTR be present in the hearts of older adult patients with AD? Identification of such individuals early in the course of ATTR cardiac amyloidosis is now critically important as novel therapies such as the transthyretin stabilizer, tafamidis, can reduce morbidity and mortality in such patients (10). Additionally, emerging data from hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis demonstrates that with longer duration of disease achieved by disease modification with liver transplant, transient focal neurologic events attributable to ATTR cerebral amyloid angiopathy confirmed by 11C-PiB retention in the brain are common (11). Such data foreshadow the emergence of a new phenotype in patients with ATTR cardiac amyloidosis, one involving a central nervous system origin, related to TTR amyloid deposits. Thus, the other side of the coin is that TTR cardiac amyloidosis could have a yet unrecognized or underappreciated central nervous system component.

Proteostasis is one of the seven pillars of Geroscience, an interdisciplinary field that is focused on the molecular relationship between biological aging and age-related diseases. Each single protein of the more than 2 million proteins produced by the human genome must be converted into a tightly folded compact structure in order to function properly. Since a single simple protein has 1016 possible starting configurations, correct folding of proteins is a remarkable testament to the power of evolutionary biology. Protein folding and the mechanisms for handling misfolded proteins are an emerging and modifiable mechanism of disorders including AD and HF due to amyloidosis. Translating the emerging biology in this arena to benefit older adult patients with disorders such as AD and HF holds great promise for our older adult patients but will require ongoing collaborations of providers in both neurology, geriatrics, cardiology and beyond.
