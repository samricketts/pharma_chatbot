FK506 binding protein 51 (FKBP51) is a molecular chaperone that influences stress response. In addition to having an integral role in the regulation of steroid hormone receptors, including glucocorticoid receptor, FKBP51 has been linked with several biological processes including metabolism and neuronal health. Genetic and epigenetic alterations in the gene that encodes FKBP51, FKBP5, are associated with increased susceptibility to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, which has fueled much of the research on this protein. Because of the complexity of these processes, animal models have been important in understanding the role of FKBP51. This review examines each of the current mouse models of FKBP5, which include whole animal knockout, conditional knockout, overexpression, and humanized mouse models. The generation of each model and observational details are discussed, including behavioral phenotypes, molecular changes, and electrophysiological alterations basally and following various challenges. While much has been learned through these models, there are still many aspects of FKBP51 biology that remain opaque and future studies are needed to help illuminate these current gaps in knowledge. Overall, FKBP5 continues to be an exciting potential target for stress-related disorders.

pmc1. Introduction

The 51kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP51) is a member of the immunophilin family1. FKBP51 has been mainly studied for its role in the regulation of steroid hormone receptors2; 3, although there is growing interest for its role in metabolism, immune modulation, cancer, autophagy, and neurodegenerative disease4–7. The gene encoding human FKBP51, FKBP5, consists of 13 exons and 12 introns and is located on chromosome 68; 9. The expression of FKBP5 is highly regulated by glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) located in intron 7, intron 5, intron 2, and upstream of the promoter8; 10. Full-length 457 amino acid FKBP51 protein contains three highly conserved domains: a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) FKBP-Type 1 domain, a PPIase FKBP-like domain, and a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain11. The PPIase activity from the first domain catalyzes cis-trans conversion of peptidyl-prolyl bonds of client proteins whereas the TPR domain is associated with chaperoning activity in conjunction with the 90kDa Heat Shock Protein (Hsp90). Human FKBP5 mRNA is ~85% identical to mouse Fkbp5. In mice, Fkbp5 is located on chromosome 17 and consists of 11 exons, regulated by GREs located in intron 1 and intron 5. Full-length mouse FKBP51 protein is 456 amino acids and shares ~87% identity with human.

FKBP51 in concert with Hsp90 is involved in several biological processes including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated stress response12. As part of an ultra-short negative feedback loop, FKBP51 maintains GR in a low-affinity state, increasing resistance to steroid hormones, like cortisol in humans or corticosterone in mice, which will be referred to as CORT throughout the review13–15. Upon stress, CORT levels increase and FKBP51 is displaced by other chaperones, ultimately mediating the nuclear transactivation of GR13. In the nucleus, GR functions as a transcription factor to regulate GRE-containing genes, including FKBP516. Chronic dysregulation of the stress response is suggested to be the root cause of numerous psychiatric disorders17; 18

Psychiatric disorders are heterogenous, and there are multiple determinants that contribute to the symptoms. Candidate gene studies revealed that common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FKBP5 combined with stressors (either childhood trauma19 or lifetime separation events20) can increase susceptibility for several mental health disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)21–24, borderline personality disorder25, bipolar disorder26, major depressive disorder (MDD)24; 27–31, schizophrenia32, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)33. One of the most studied SNPs, rs1360780, reduces FKBP5 DNA methylation, increasing stress driven FKBP5 expression34 making carriers vulnerable to these mental disorders.

Mouse models have provided an essential resource for the investigation of FKBP51 biology (Figure 1). This review will discuss each of the current genetically engineered FKBP51 mouse models, insights from this work, and key aspects to consider in the future. A summary of these studies is provided in Tables 1 - 2.

2. Genetic FKBP5 mouse models

2.1. Fkbp5−/− mouse models

To better understand the role of FKBP51, two whole animal knockout mouse models were independently generated. Each of these models has been extensively characterized and has been used to establish much of what is known regarding the role of FKBP51 in general physiology, behavior, neuroendocrine dynamics, and metabolism.

2.1.1. Fkbp5−/−

The first Fkbp5−/− mouse model was generated in 2005 by insertional mutagenesis of a lacZ/neomycin cassette to replace exon 2 of the Fkbp5 gene (Figure 1A)35. C57BL/6 blastocysts were injected with the embryonic stem cell clones containing the disrupted Fkbp5 allele, which were subsequently implanted into pseudopregnant 129/SvJ female mice. Chimeric offspring were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to generate F1 offspring. Fkbp5−/− mice were then generated via heterozygous mating36; 37. Both Fkbp5+/- and Fkbp5−/− mice are viable and fertile. β-galactosidase is in frame with the Fkbp5 initiation codon, which has been shown to increase in the brains of mice throughout aging37, like the FKBP51 protein38. Progeny of this line that have been crossed with C57BL/6J mice are commercially available (Jackson Laboratory Strain #017989). One important caveat to consider when using this model is the identification of a gene duplication in glyoxalase-1 (Glo1), which is also on Chromosome 17 and was the result of breeding with 129/SvJ mice39. This duplication causes a two-fold upregulation of the GLO1 protein, which has also been independently linked with psychiatric disorders40–43.

Overall, Fkbp5−/− mice develop normally and do not have any major alterations in their expected lifespan or blood composition44. While there is a significant decrease in the serum cytokine levels specifically for IL-1β and IL-5 in 6-month-old Fkbp5−/− mice, this difference is absent above 10 months of age44. Fkbp5−/− mice are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates in general activity and motor coordination (Figure 2A)37. In one study, Fkbp5−/− mice were shown to have a normal glucose tolerance44, while in another some improvements were reported45. However, these benefits become more apparent when challenged with a high fat diet, where Fkbp5−/− mice were also protected from weight gain and had improved insulin tolerance45. In general, adult female Fkbp5−/− mice exhibit lower body weight and increased lean mass compared to wild-type females45; 46. Male Fkbp5−/− mice also show reduced body weight compared to wild-type male littermates47. However, these basal weight differences appear to subside with age37. Lower adrenal and thymus weights were reported in Fkbp5−/− male mice47, which was also confirmed in female Fkbp5−/− mice46.

Fkbp5−/− mice have been reported to have lower basal serum CORT levels throughout aging, starting at 10 months of age44, which was replicated in separate studies that used only male48; 49 and female mice46, respectively. The loss of FKBP51 also results in lower CORT upregulation following stressors37; 46–48. Other stress hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), have been investigated but the only significant changes reported to date are in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of female Fkbp5−/− mice, which show a significant increase in CRH expression compared to female wild-type mice46; 47.

While there has yet to be a full proteomic or transcriptomic analysis in Fkbp5−/− mice under basal conditions, there were 23 downregulated and 18 upregulated microRNAs reported in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of Fkbp5−/− mice50, many of which correlate with human microRNAs associated with PTSD onset and severity51 and have been reported to regulate proteins involved in neuronal development and axon myelination50; 52. For example, validation of the target genes revealed Fkbp5−/− mice have reduced expression of actin-binding LIM protein 1 (Ablim1), kinesin family member 5c (Kif5c), and ephrin type-A receptor 4 (Epha4), and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in the medial prefrontal cortex50. Neurofascin (Nfasc) mRNA and protein expression was also found to be significantly decreased in the medial prefrontal cortex and corpus callosum of Fkbp5−/− mice50. These alterations were concomitant with lowered myelin basic protein levels and reduced myelination50. Structural analysis using Voxel-based morphometry in male Fkbp5−/− mice revealed smaller volumes in the thalamus, periaqueductal gray, and dorsal raphe nucleus, without major alterations in the hippocampal structure, which were complemented with altered brain connectivity, as determined by diffusion tensor imaging53. No change in expression of microglial makers in the hippocampus was found during basal conditions54. Similarly, markers of astrocytes, synapses, and immediate early genes were not found to be changed under basal conditions, at least in the cerebellum55. FKBP52 has been shown to be significantly decreased in the cerebellum of Fkbp5−/− mice, while significant elevations were shown in the prefrontal cortex55. Reduced tau levels, which accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), have been previously reported in Fkbp5−/− mice56.

Fkbp5−/− male mice show increased wake times during dark period, which results in an increased time spent sleeping49. In sleep deprived periods, Fkbp5−/− male mice have improved sleep homeostasis and require lower amounts of sleep for recovery49. A study looking at 12–16-week-old female Fkbp5−/− mice found a significant increase in swimming time on the forced swim test, suggesting less basal depression-like behavior46. There is a modest, but significant increase in reversal spatial learning in 6-month-old mixed sex Fkbp5−/− mice, compared to wild-type littermates, as determined by the radial-arm water maze44. No behavioral differences in Fkbp5−/− mice have been reported for working memory, anxiety-like behavior, stress-coping behavior, associative fear conditioning, or exploratory drive under basal conditions37; 46; 48; 57. Male Fkbp5−/− mice demonstrate normal sensitivity to physical pain and acute inflammatory pain, but show protection from mechanical pain sensitivity when exposed to chronic pain, regardless of whether it is caused by inflammatory or neuropathic pain58, which was replicated in mixed sex cohorts59. Motor abilities were maintained in male Fkbp5−/− mice following spared nerve injury58. Mixed sex 8–12-week-old Fkbp5−/− mice also showed protection from chemotherapy-induced pain59. These studies suggested that these protections were a result of blunted GR signaling and reduced IL-6 upregulation in Fkbp5−/− mice58; 59.

While minimal differences are reported in Fkbp5−/− mice under basal conditions, many phenotypic and molecular differences can be measured when exposed to stressors including tube restraint, social stress, age, or inflammatory challenge. Aged (17–20-month-old) mixed sex Fkbp5−/− mice show reduced immobility time in the tail suspension test and forced swim test, suggesting reduced depression-like behavior compared to wild-type age-matched littermates37. This protection was measured as early as 10 months of age and correlates with reduced serum CORT levels44. Similar protection from depression-like behavior was also found in 10–16-week-old male Fkbp5−/− mice by forced swim test following a 60-minute tube restraint and in 13-week-old male Fkbp5−/− mice following chronic social defeat stress, which were matched with reduced serum CORT following stress47; 48. Fkbp5−/− male mice maintain pleasure seeking behavior even after 21 days of chronic tube restraint stress, as measured by sucrose preference60. This protection from stress-induced deficits was further complemented by transcriptomic data from the medial prefrontal cortex, where male Fkbp5−/− mice demonstrate an altered profile of genes related to nervous system development, immune response activation, and gland morphogenesis, which were maintained similar to unstressed male wild-type mice but altered in male wild-type mice exposed to chronic tube restraint stress52; 60.

Administration of the potent immune activator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in 12-week-old male Fkbp5−/− mice enhanced anxiety-like behavior (open field and elevated plus maze), which was complemented by reduced immune responses and microglial markers in the hippocampus54. At the same time, LPS treatment also reduced the expression of Nr3c1, the gene that encodes GR, and serum/GC regulated kinase 1 (Sgk1) in the hippocampus, while glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (Gad65) was not increased, which was in contrast to the upregulation of Gad65 observed in LPS-treated wild-type mice54. In another study, 10–13-week-old male Fkbp5−/− mice exposed to restraint stress maintained higher levels of pS473 AKT and synapsin in the prefrontal cortex but not the hippocampus compared to wild-type mice, while synaptophysin, MAP2, and GFAP remained unaffected61. GR expression was also reduced in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of wild-type male mice exposed to restraint stress, but male Fkbp5−/− mice were less affected61. Following acute electric foot shock 8–12-week-old male Fkbp5−/− mice show decreased secretion of cathepsin D, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and mBDNF62. Fkbp5−/− female mice are protected from maternal stress-induced pre-term birth compared to wild-type littermates, which is further enhanced when mated with a Fkbp5−/− male mice instead of a wild-type male63. Uterine tissues from the stress exposed Fkbp5−/− mothers revealed a maintenance of progesterone while having lower levels of the inactivating enzyme, Akr1c18 compared to stress exposed wild-type mothers63.

Interestingly, the protection from stress-induced depression-like behavior was shown to be ablated in 10–13-week-old male Fkbp5−/− mice treated with the anti-depressants, which was found to be mediated through altered autophagy signaling57. More specifically, male Fkbp5−/− mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress lacked the anti-depressant molecular changes observed in wild-type mice for the autophagy marker, pS473 AKT57, pS9 GSK-3β64, DNMT1 phosphorylation, or BDNF exon IV promoter methylation65. In contrast, male Fkbp5−/− mice at 10–16-weeks-old treated with lithium, a mood stabilizer that also targets GSK-3β, have reduced upregulation of GSK-3β phosphorylation and collapsin response mediator protein 2 in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and blood when compared to male wild-type mice64. Female Fkbp5−/− mice did not show improvements in depression-like behavior following S-ketamine treatment like wild-type mice66. In the same study, male Fkbp5−/− mice treated with S-ketamine failed to show increases in secreted BDNF, like wild-type mice66.

2.1.2. Fkbp5−/− (int4)

The second whole animal knockout mouse model, Fkbp5−/− (int 4), was generated by disrupting the mouse Fkbp5 gene via a single genomic insertion at intron 4 that encodes a Fkbp51-βgeo fusion protein (Figure 1B), which lacks the PPIase and TPR domains needed for FKBP51 protein function67. The vector is then introduced to RRC236 embryonic stem cells to generate chimeric male mice, which were originally established on a mixed C57BL/6J:129SvEv genetic background and then backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background67; 68. Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice are viable and fertile67. Similar to the model above, β-galactosidase staining is used as a proxy for FKBP51 levels, which is observed in multiple brain regions including the hippocampus and striatum by one month of age69.

Male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice have reduced locomotor activity compared to wild-type littermates68. Reduced body weight for Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice between 6–16 weeks compared to wild-type controls has been reported, which is complemented by a lack of increase in body fat, increased thermogenesis, and a maintenance of lean mass over this timeframe68. Similar to the model above, this becomes even more apparent when fed a high fat diet, which causes negligible changes in overall weight, body fat, and lean mass in Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice, unlike wild-type controls68. Levels of triglycerides and free fatty acids are also lower in the serum of 5–6-month-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice, which remain lower following exposure to high fat diet. This may be mediated, at least in part, through reduced PPARϒ activity, since 5–6-month-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice were also protected from treatment with a PPARϒ agonist known to increase weight68. Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice fed a high fat diet also showed reduced liver weight, improved insulin sensitivity and improved glucose tolerance compared to wild-type controls68. Basal serum CORT levels were unchanged in Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice regardless of sex, however there was a non-significant trend towards a decrease in female Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice69, while androgen receptor (AR) remained unchanged67. 3-month-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice displayed increased depression-like behavior by a longer time spent immobile on the forced swim test70, which also show a lower preference for saccharin70.

A recent study revealed male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice have morphological differences in their brain structure, which includes an elongated dentate gyrus and reduced hippocampal height71. These changes were complemented by reduced levels of βIII-tubulin, MAP2, and tau protein in the hippocampus, while the levels of Parkin protein, which is associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) was significantly increased in the same region71. While neuronal excitability is unchanged, 3.5-week-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice have increased inhibitory neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex, which may be due to reduced GR activation72. 8-week-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice have reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and lower basal excitatory neurotransmission, which is in part attributed to a reduced glutamate receptor expression (NMDAR1-type, NMDAR2B-type, and AMPA-type), while GABA-type receptors and inhibitory neurotransmission are increased70. The expression of GAD65 was also found to be significantly elevated in hippocampal tissues from 8-week-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice.

6-month-old male Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice show an increased intake for alcohol and reduced fluid intake compared to wild-type mice, a trait not observed in females69. With no difference in alcohol metabolism, increased blood alcohol concentrations are found in Fkbp5−/− (int 4) males for up to three hours post cessation of alcohol access69. Lipidomic analysis revealed lower levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol, an increase in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamines, and an increase in the expression of genes related to the CDP-choline pathway and Pemt, which is important for phosphatidylcholine processing in the livers from Fkbp5−/− (int 4) mice73. These changes were associated with protection from alcohol-induced fatty liver and a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines compared to alcohol exposed control mice73.

2.1.3 Fkbp5Frt/Frt

The Fkbp5Frt/Frt knockout mouse, also known as Fkbp5tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi, was generated as part of the knockout mouse project (KOMP), whereby exon 9 of the Fkbp5 gene was flanked by flp recombinase target (FRT) sites (Figure 1C)74. Crossing these knockout mice with tissue specific promoter and Cre-recombinase expressing mice allows the reinstatement of Fkbp5 in a tissue-specific manner. Recent work demonstrates that 4–6-month-old Fkbp5Frt/Frt mice have reduced adrenal and thymus weight compared to wild-type littermates75. Diurnal CORT levels are also significantly decreased both basally and following acute stress. Elevated basal ACTH levels have also been reported, which decrease upon acute stress. Using a dexamethasone (DEX)/CRH test, Fkbp5Frt/Frt mice show no differences in CORT levels after DEX challenge, but CORT levels are decreased following CRH challenge75. Viral-mediated reinstatement of Fkbp5 expression in the PVN of Fkbp5Frt/Frt mice increased basal serum CORT levels at the trough without affecting the peak levels, while elevated CORT was measured after tube restraint stress. Increased adrenal weights and higher Crh expression were also reported compared to wild-type mice75. This work highlights Fkbp5 expression in the PVN as a major influencer of the HPA axis, at least in male mice.

2.2. Fkbp5−/− conditional knockout mouse models

2.2.1. Fkbp5PVN−/−

Conditional knockout of Fkbp5 in the PVN was carried out by crossing Fkbp5lox/lox (Fkbp5tm1c(KOMP)Wtsi) mice on the C57BL/6N background with Sim1-Cre mice whereby Cre-mediated recombination in Sim1-expressing tissue results in deletion of Fkbp5 in the PVN (Figure 1D)75. Fkbp5PVN−/− adult male mice at 16–20 weeks-old displayed reduced body weight, reduced adrenal gland weight, and increased thymus weight while 8-weeks-old male mice had no change75. Basally, diurnal CORT levels were unchanged, however following a 15-minute tube restraint, CORT levels in Fkbp5PVN−/− male mice were significantly decreased compared to Fkbp5lox/lox control mice, an effect which lasted longer in ~4-month-old mice compared 2-month-old mice75. Additionally, ~4-month-old male Fkbp5PVN−/− mice had reduced response to steroid administration in a combined DEX/CRH test and increased pS234 and pS211 GR75, which has been corelated with an inactive form of GR76; 77.

2.2.2 PomcFkbp5−/−

Conditional knockout of Fkbp5 in all proopiomelanocortin (Pomc)-expressing cells was carried out by crossing Fkbp5lox/lox mice on the C57BL/6N background with Pomc-Cre mice (Figure 1E)78. Male PomcFkbp5−/− mice have normal body weight and adrenal weight78. At 3–4 months of age, male PomcFkbp5−/− mice had comparable baseline serum CORT levels to Fkbp5lox/lox control mice but had significantly reduced serum CORT levels after 15 minutes of tube restraint78. Young male PomcFkbp5−/− mice also showed reduced pituitary-related ACTH levels in the morning and a trend towards lower ACTH levels following 15 minutes of tube restraint when compared to Fkbp5lox/lox control mice78. This was in contrast with reduced baseline CORT levels in male 7–8-month-old PomcFkbp5−/− mice, while CORT levels following restraint stress and ACTH levels at baseline remained unchanged compared to Fkbp5lox/lox control mice. In a DEX/CRH test, male PomcFkbp5−/− mice showed reduced CORT levels after CRH stimulation when compared to age-matched Fkbp5lox/lox control mice. Several behavioral tasks were performed, such as the open field test, elevated plus maze, and dark-light box test, however while a mild anxiolytic phenotype was measured in PomcFkbp5−/− mice, the observed hyperactivity in this model confounds the interpretation.

2.2.3. Sf1Fkbp5−/−

Conditional knockout of Fkbp5 in all steroidogenic factor 1 (Sf1)-expressing cells of the ventromedial hypothalamus was carried out by crossing Fkbp5lox/lox mice on the C57BL/6N background with Sf1-Cre mice (Figure 1F)79. Compared to Fkbp5lox/lox controls, Sf1Fkbp5−/− male and female mice had an increased fat:lean mass ratio with a non-significant increase in body weight at 4–5-months-old. Other metabolic parameters including glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, activity and food intake were indistinguishable from controls79. These observations were consistent when mice were challenged with high fat diet. After 21-weeks on high fat diet, male mice had lower adrenal gland weight while CORT and ACTH levels were comparable, suggesting the observed decrease in adrenal gland weight did not impact HPA axis activity.

2.3. rTgFKBP5 mouse model

Given FKBP5 expression increases with normal aging and in response to stress44; 56, a stable transgenic mouse model that overexpresses human FKBP5 in the corticolimbic system was developed. To generate this model, FVB founder mice expressing a single copy of the coding region of the human FKBP5 gene was inserted in the Hip11 locus through site-specific recombination were crossed with 129S6 mice containing the Tet transactivator protein (tTA) driven by a CamKIIα promoter80. The offspring, rTgFKBP5, overexpress FKBP5 in the forebrain in a Tet-Off regulatable expression system (Figure 1G). Validation of 4–6-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice showed high expression of human FKBP5 throughout the forebrain region and the hippocampus with ~12-fold higher FKBP5 expression and ~5 fold higher FKBP51 protein levels80.

No differences in body weight, fertility, general activity, or motor skill function were observed in 3-month-old male and female rTgFKBP5 mice compared to wild-type or tTA mice (Figure 2B)80. It is important to note that the ideal controls for the rTgFKBP5 model are tTA mice, since this transgene causes phenotypes that are different from wild-type mice81. Basal CORT levels were decreased in 2-month-old and 7-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice, with more pronounced effects in females82. Neuropathological characterization of 10-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice showed increased Ki-67, a proliferation marker, decreased number of hippocampal neurons, and significant upregulation of microglial markers82. Reduced AKT levels in the dorsal hippocampus have also been measured83. Electrophysiological responses of ~3-month-old rTgFKBP5 ex vivo hippocampal slices showed significant impairment of long term-depression with a modest enhancement of long-term potentiation compared to tTA controls, which may be partially caused by an increase in basal neurotransmission80. GluR1-type AMPA receptor recycling to the membrane is also increased in rTgFKBP5 mice, as determined by shorter internalization times in ex vivo slices, which is potentially mediated through enhanced Hsp90 binding80.

No differences in depression-like phenotypes by tail suspension or forced swim test have been reported in 3-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice80. However, female 10-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice show a significant increase in immobility in tail-suspension test compared to wild-type mice and a trend towards an increase compared to tTA controls82. Overall, male and female rTgFKBP5 mice do not show an increase in anxiety-like behavior through the open field or elevated plus maze tasks, but 4–5-month males did show a significant reduction in the time spent in the open arms compared to wild-type littermates, but the difference from tTA controls did not reach significance82. 3-month-old female rTgFKBP5 mice have reduced pleasure seeking behavior compared to tTA controls, as determined by a lack of sucrose preference80. Male and female rTgFKBP5 mice are indistinguishable from littermate controls in startle response and associative fear conditioning80; 82; 83. However impaired spatial reversal learning and memory deficits have been shown in two independent studies in rTgFKBP5 mice80; 83.

In studies of early life stress (ELS), 2-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice that experienced maternal separation postnatally have elevated anxiety-like behavior by elevated plus maze, with a more pronounced effect in females83. 2-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice exposed to ELS also showed reduced inhibition to startle by prepulse inhibition, another phenotype that was also more dominant in females83. In contrast, ELS exposure prevented susceptibility to depressive-like behavior in 7-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice measured by tail suspension test82. ELS exposure suppressed overall CORT levels in 2-month-old wild-type and control mice, particularly in females, while CORT was further lowered in rTgFKBP5 mice, which was driven by males82. ELS exposure blocked a CORT reduction in 7-month-old female rTgFKBP5 mice82. Neurogenesis marker, doublecortin, was specifically decreased in 5-month-old but not 10-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice exposed to ELS, while microglial marker, Iba1, was significantly decreased in 10-month-old rTgFKBP5 mice exposed to ELS, the opposite of what is seen at this age in the absence of stress82. Regardless of age or stress exposure, rTgFKBP5 mice do not show altered associative fear conditioning82.

2.4. Humanized FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) and resilience-associated (C/G) models

In the interest of studying risk- and resilience-associated FKBP5 SNPS and the related effects on glucocorticoid-mediated stress response, two transgenic mouse models were developed based on the well-characterized human FKBP5 SNP rs1360780 located on intron 2, which contains a functional GRE8. Due to a chromatin conformational change, the risk-associated adenine/thymine (A/T) allele of rs1360780 is associated with higher FKBP5 induction upon glucocorticoid stimulation when compared to the resilience-associated cytosine/guanine (C/G) allele and increased susceptibility for psychiatric symptoms, especially in individuals exposed to early life adversity34.

The humanized FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) and the FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) transgenic mouse models were generated in C57BL/6J RPCI‐23 BAC clones by replacing the Fkbp5 mouse genomic sequence following exon 2 through exon 11 with the equivalent human genomic content andFRT flanked NeoR and F3 flanked PuroR selection markers, which contained either the rs1360780 (A/T) or (C/G) in the human intron 284. This vector was electroporated into a C57BL/6N Tac ES cell line and following homologous recombination, positive clones were selected based on selection markers. After flippase-mediated removal of selection markers, chimeras were generated from injected the resulting ES cells containing the humanized allele into blastocytes, which were subsequently bred with C57BL/6NTac mice. This generated humanized FKBP5 mouse lines that contain the risk-associated (A/T) genotype, C57BL/6NTac-Fkbp5-tm4570(FKBP5)Tac, or the resilience-associated (C/G) genotype, C57BL/6NTac-Fkbp5-tm4571(*FKBP5)Tac, respectively, which are commercially available through Taconic Biosciences (Figure 1H). Confirmation of humanized FKBP51 expression after dexamethasone treatment was validated in primary cell cultures by Western blot and expression of FKBP5 upon glucocorticoid receptor stimulation was confirmed to be higher in FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice compared to FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice, as expected84.

To date, no changes in body weight, fertility, or motor skill function have been reported in FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) or FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice when compared to wild-type mice (Figure 2C). In regards to diurnal serum CORT levels, 3-month-old female FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice showed higher resting CORT levels leading to less pronounced rhythmicity when compared to female FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice84. Surprisingly, after short-term behavioral stress activities, such as restraint or dexamethasone treatment, no significant differences in CORT levels were observed between FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) and FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) genotypes at ~6.5 months of age85. Thus far, studies involving histological staining or electrophysiology recordings have not been reported.

Behaviorally under basal conditions, female 2.5-month-old FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice were slower to habituate to a novel environment compared to FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice, as recorded by higher activity in a brightly illuminated open field test85; 86. Working memory was unaffected regardless of genotype as measured by equivalent spontaneous alterations in a T-maze in ~3-month-old mice85. In a dark-light test, 3.5-month-old FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice had a trend towards less time in the dark, suggesting less anxiety-like behavior when compared to FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice85. Socially, ~5-month-old female FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice showed a preference for social interaction as measured by more time spent with a stimulus mouse and more time spent with an unfamiliar mouse when compared to FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice85.

Basally, FKBP5 mRNA expression was similar between FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) and FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice in primary cultures of astrocytes, microglia, and neurons, but were decreased overall compared to wild-type mice, driven by changes in astrocyte expression between the groups84. In response to glucocorticoid stimulation, primary cells from FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice showed a dose-dependent increase of FKBP5 mRNA expression, which was most pronounced in astrocytes84. To identify differences in gene expression in the brains of these mice, mRNA sequencing was carried out in the hypothalamus, ventral hippocampus, and dorsal hippocampus of female FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) and FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice85. Results of this study collectively identified more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the hypothalamus (349 up, 230 down in A/T) than the hippocampus (ventral: 18 up, 23 down; dorsal: 1 up, 1 down in A/T). KEGG pathway analysis showed an overall significant downregulation of pathways involved in neuronal communication and upregulated pathways involved in metabolism in FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice compared to FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice85. KEGG pathway analysis in the hypothalamus revealed significant downregulation of pathways involved in circadian rhythm, regulation of synaptic plasticity, and dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling in FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice compared to FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice85. The decrease in genes related to neuronal communication and increase in genes related to metabolism was also found in the ventral hippocampus of FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice compared to FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice85. In regards to known GR-related genes, FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice showed lower levels of FKBP5 in the hippocampus and less Hsp90ab1 in the hypothalamus, ventral and dorsal hippocampus than FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice85.

Female FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice exposed to ELS through maternal separation, were more impacted behaviorally by ELS than female FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice85; 86. ELS-exposed female FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice showed a slower rate of habituation and a decrease in social preference while ELS-exposed FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice showed no change when compared to their respective non-ELS genotype85. These results may seem surprising but can be explained by an already reduced rate of habitation and social preference, basally, for FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice when compared to female FKBP5 resilience-associated (C/G) mice85. In support of this data, ELS-exposed female FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice showed a reduced number of DEGs (114 DEGs for A/T vs. 903 DEGs for C/G) when compared to their respective non-ELS genotypes, supporting the behavioral data that ELS affects FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) mice less due to an already compromised neurological environment85.

3. Concluding Remarks and Future Directions

FKBP5 has been associated with several psychiatric disorders with a wide spectrum of symptoms and heterogenous phenotypes21–24; 32. This review highlights each of the available genetic mouse models of FKBP5. While these models do not capture all the core symptoms of these and other stress-related disorders, they are useful in reproducing a subset of endo-phenotypes that have deepened our understanding of FKBP51 biology.

Overall, the lack of Fkbp5 in mice is beneficial towards affective-like behavior, neuroinflammation, excess weight gain, neuronal health, sleep profile, and chronic pain. These protections are emphasized with various challenges (age, stress, high fat diet, etc.) and closely linked to decreased stress hormone production44; 47; 48; 75. Surprisingly, rTgFKBP5 mice also show reduced serum CORT. However, with the dynamic changes of CORT throughout the day, it is still unclear if the CORT circadian cycle is dysregulated in rTgFKBP5 mice, which may explain the decreased levels at the single time point tested. Especially since CORT is elevated following FKBP51 viral overexpression in the PVN either in wild-type mice or in Fkbp5 PVN knockout mice exposed to stress75. This suggests that additional brain regions expressing CamKIIα outside of the PVN may influence CORT dynamics in rTgFKBP5 mice. Spatial learning and memory also appear to be affected, at least in part, by FKBP51, since Fkbp5−/− mice show improved learning, while rTgFKBP5 mice are impaired. This regulation is likely influenced by altered neurotransmission, which was reported in rTgFKBP5 mice, in regard to altered AMPA receptor recycling. Gene expression changes related to the regulation of synaptic plasticity and dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling were identified in FKBP5 humanized risk-associated (A/T) female mice, further supporting a role for FKBP51 in regulating neurotransmission. Autophagic flux activation, which also contributes to learning and memory, was found to be altered in Fkbp5−/− mice57 but it is still unclear if changes in this pathway contribute to FKBP5-mediated effects on cognition.

Recently, multiple Fkbp5 conditional knockout mouse models have been described75; 78; 79, which have started to illuminate brain region specific roles for FKBP51. It is clear that FKBP51 expression in the hypothalamus, either in the PVN or Pomc-expressing neurons, impacts CORT regulation following stress as well as DEX/CRH response75; 78. While FKBP51 expression in Sf1-positive neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamus does not impact CORT levels, and contrary to the lower basal body weights in mice lacking Fkbp5 in the PVN, Fkbp5 ablation in Sf1-positive neurons actually increased basal body weight, while adrenal weights were reduced in both models75; 79. This suggests differential roles of FKBP51 even within the hypothalamus. With the availability of the Fkbp5Frt/Frt and Fkbp5lox/lox models, there are numerous questions that can now be addressed regarding the impact of regional or cell type-specific expression or ablation of Fkbp5 and how FKBP51 influences the cross talk between cells and brain regions.

Primary cells from FKBP5 humanized mice show the highest stress-induced change in those with the lowest basal expression (astrocytes&gt;microglia&gt;neurons), which is further exacerbated by the A/T risk SNP84. This is in line with prior in situ data in mice reporting the highest induction of Fkbp5 expression in brain regions with the lowest basal levels87. However, decreased basal CORT levels measured in female FKBP5 risk-associated (A/T) humanized mice were unchanged following stress. This leaves a gap between this mouse model and what is found in humans with this risk SNP that warrants additional studies to fully characterize these interactions. Because FKBP5 levels increase significantly with age56, it is likely that dynamics seen earlier in life in different tissues start to be lessened and contribute to the general increase in serum CORT levels found in aged individuals88. Alcohol and inflammation are also additional inducers of FKBP5 expression54; 69. Recently, upregulation of FKBP5 levels in the brain following COVID infection was also reported89–91. Additional studies are needed to fully understand the consequences of increased FKBP51 levels in the brain and other organs. However, it is known that chronic exposure to excessive CORT is linked to several adverse metabolic effects including obesity, insulin resistance, and onset of type-2-diabetes92; 93. In mice, Fkbp5 ablation supports lower body weight, increased lean muscle, reduced plasma lipids, elevated energy expenditure, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance45; 46; 68. A role of FKBP51 in oxidative stress in the mitochondria has been reported but more work needs to be done to investigate this 94.

Fkbp5−/− mice show reduced tau levels56; 71, a protein known to pathogenically accumulate in AD and other tauopathies. High FKBP51 has been linked to vulnerability in excitatory neurons in the AD brain95 and poorer cognitive stability96. Links to PD have also been made, since Fkbp5−/− mice also have increased Parkin and FKBP51 can interact with PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1), both of which are genetically linked to PD. Recent work also demonstrated that treatment with FKBP51-inhibitor, SAFit2, reduces the accumulation of mutant huntingtin in cultured cells and in two mouse models of Huntington’s disease97. Besides protein aggregates, neurodegenerative diseases are hallmarked by neuroinflammation and metabolic changes98; 99. In addition to the metabolic protection described above, Fkbp5 ablation lowers pro-inflammatory cytokines and protects from transcriptomic changes of chronic stress. High levels of FKBP51 in the rTgFKBP5 mouse model correlated with increased levels of microglial marker, Iba1. FKBP51 has also been shown to be important for NF-κB signaling, through direct binding to the IκBα kinase (IKK) complex100. This indicates that targeting FKBP51 may be beneficial for multiple pathways that are dysregulated in neurodegenerative disease. However, more studies are needed to validate FKBP51 as a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Even without the presence of adversity, reports have described associations between FKBP5 SNPs and stress-related disorders, such as major depressive disorder30, bipolar disorder101, depression in AD102; 103, and ADHD104 as well as impaired working memory in aged individuals105. In line with its regulatory action on GR activity, SNPs in FKBP5 have also been associated with dysregulated CORT levels and altered response to steroid hormone stimulation and to various psychological stressors106–108. Transcriptomic studies in FKBP5 SNP mice identified alterations in pathways that commonly show deficits individuals suffering from stress-associated psychiatric disorders. These include differential expression in genes related to metabolism, circadian rhythm, and neuronal communications. Individuals with psychiatric disorders commonly exhibit alterations in the circadian rhythm109, but the impact of FKBP51 on the circadian rhythm has yet to be explored. Core genes within the circadian clock are transcriptionally regulated by the GR110. Moreover, the transcriptomic profile of Fkbp5−/− mice exposed to stress shows differential expression of core clock genes, Period 1 and Period 260. Future work is needed to understand how FKBP51 contributes to cell-autonomous and non-autonomous circadian rhythms. Proteomic and transcriptomic studies have yet to be done in Fkbp5−/− mice, outside of a single study using stressed male Fkbp5−/− mice without unstressed controls, which limits our understanding of the impact of FKBP51 in biology. Future unbiased studies that identify FKBP51-regulated pathways basally and under various challenges are needed. Since the studies summarized in this review also demonstrate differences in the role of FKBP5 by sex and in discrete brain regions and cell types, future studies should also consider spatial and single cell approaches while using sex as a biological variable.

In many circumstances, alterations of FKBP5 had more pronounced effects in female mice. Sex differences are common in psychiatric disorders and factors such as puberty, menstrual cycle, and pregnancy have been proposed to trigger the onset or reoccurrence of these disorders111. Women are more predisposed to depression, anxiety, late-onset schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease than men112–115. The HPA axis is modulated by sex-specific steroids such as progesterone and estradiol (both reported to interact with FKBP51 and GR) and this has been highlighted as a possible explanation for the higher vulnerability to anxiety in females116 and biological mechanism for these changes117. This suggests that the sex bias may be mediated in part through the dysregulation of FKBP51. Moreover, a recent study revealed females have a significant upregulation of FKBP5 in whole blood and cortex compared to males103. Furthermore, clinical studies have reported that women exposed to trauma and carriers of FKBP5 risk SNP present increased incidences of anxiety and poor brain connectivity118. More studies are needed to better understand the sex-specific differences in stress-related disorders as they relate to FKBP51.

Overall, these studies highlight the impact of FKBP51, particularly in stress-related biological processes (Figure 3). They also emphasize the need to use both sexes in behavioral studies, particularly those modeling diseases with a sex-bias in humans. FKBP51 remains an interesting target for multiple indications, including neuropsychiatric disorders and metabolism. The recent development of humanized FKBP5 rs1360780 SNP mice and conditional Fkbp5 knockout mouse models has propelled the field forward, given the many links FKBP5 dysregulation has in human disorders and supports the testing of hypotheses that were previously untestable in vivo.

A. Fkbp5−/− mice were generated by replacing exon 2 of Fkbp5 with lacZ/neomycin cassette. B. Fkbp5−/− (int4) mice were generated by insertion of β-geo into intron 4 of the Fkbp5 gene. C. Fkbp5Frt/Frt mice were generated as part of the knockout mouse project (KOMP), by a targeted insertion of LacZ and a neomycin (neo) selection cassette flanked by flpe recombinase target sites (FRT) between exons 8 and 9. Exon 9 is flanked by Cre recombinase target sites (loxP). Fkbp5lox/lox was generated by crossing the Fkbp5Frt/Frt mice with Flpe-Deleter mice (not shown), which allows for the cleavage at the FRT sites by flip recombinase restoring Fkbp5 activity. Fkbp5lox/lox mice have been crossed with Cre expressing mice under cell-type specific promoters to generate D. Fkbp5PVN−/− mice (Sim1 promoter), E. PomcFkbp5 −/− mice (Pomc promoter), or F. Sf1Fkbp5−/− mice (Sf1 promoter). G. Mice containing a single-site insertion of human FKBP5 cDNA under the Tet operon and minimum CMV promoter were crossed with mice expressing a CamKIIα-regulated tet-transactivator (tTA) transgene to generate the rTgFKBP5 model.
