Individuals with dementia of the Alzheimer type (AD) classically show disproportionate impairment in measures of working memory, but repetition learning effects are relatively preserved. As AD affects brain regions implicated in both working memory and repetition effects, the neural basis of this discrepancy is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the posterior repetition effect could account for this discrepancy due to the milder effects of AD at visual cortex. Participants with early AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls performed a working memory task with superimposed repetition effects while electroencephalography was collected to identify possible neural mechanisms of preserved repetition effects. Participants with AD showed preserved behavioral repetition effects and a change in the posterior repetition effect, suggesting that visual cortex may play a role in maintained repetition effects in persons with early AD.

INTRODUCTION

Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with deficits in a range of cognitive faculties including explicit memory, language, attention, and executive function (Baars et al., 2009; Hodges, Erzinclioglu, &amp; Patterson, 2006; Wiggs, Weisberg, &amp; Martin, 2006). The broad range of deficits in AD has been linked to the broad cortical damage associated with AD, which first affects medial temporal cortex before proceeding to anterior regions, posterior regions, and finally occipital cortex (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Jiang et al., 2016). In people who present with AD, most of the cortex apart from the occipital cortex has experienced pathophysiologic change.

Despite the considerable change in the cortices of persons with AD, some cognitive capacities are relatively spared in AD. Among them are repetition learning effects, the tendency for the repetition of a stimulus to be associated with altered encoding, processing, and recollection of the subsequent presentation of that stimulus, typically such that the processing becomes more efficient or accurate (Kessels, Remmerswaal, &amp; Wilson, 2011). For example, a repeated stimulus may be processed with more cognitive resources, fewer cognitive resources, different latency of access of cognitive resources, different qualities of cognitive resources, or different behavioral outcomes than upon initial presentation (Gotts, Chow, &amp; Martin, 2012; Schacter, 1987; Weiner &amp; Grill-Spector, 2012). Distinct types of repetition effects appear differentially sensitive or robust to the progression of AD, but a common theme is that such effects are spared relative to the effect of AD on capacities such as episodic memory and working memory (Amieva et al., 2002; Carlesimo, Mauri, Fadda, Turriziani, &amp; Caltagirone, 2001; Fleischman et al., 2005; Friedman, Hamberger, Stern, &amp; Marder, 1992; Kazmerski &amp; Friedman, 1997; Millet et al., 2008).

Indeed, some types of repetition effects have been reported to be not only spared, but even enhanced in persons with AD (Fleischman et al., 2005). Individuals with moderate to severe AD have been reported to have enhanced implicit learning relative to healthy controls in the weather prediction task, where certain apparently-irrelevant symbols with slight correlation to a participant-predicted “weather” outcome unconsciously facilitate participants’ subsequent predictions, and their response time (RT) in the delayed-match-to-sample task has been reported to decrease at rates greater than individuals without impairment (Klimkowicz-Mrowiec, Slowik, Krzywoszanski, Herzog-Krzywoszanska, &amp; Szczudlik, 2008). Experimental findings like this one have motivated the development of cognitive interventions for persons with pre-AD or MCI, and they appear efficacious (Broster et al., 2013; Jean et al., 2010; Mimura &amp; Komatsu, 2010; van Halteren-van Tilborg, Scherder, &amp; Hulstijn, 2007; Zanetti et al., 1997).

Repetition “effects” are typically discussed in plural as such because their behavioral manifestation originates not from a cortical monolithic, but from a dense network of regions implicating discrete roles for frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices (Ballesteros, Reales, Mayas, &amp; Heller, 2008; Fleischman, 2007; Guo, Lawson, &amp; Jiang, 2007; Rugg, Pearl, Walker, Roberts, &amp; Holdstock, 1994). In older adults without cognitive change and people with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s disease (MCI), a common theme is that repetition effects at frontal and temporal cortical sites change, but repetition effects at occipital sites are relatively robust to cognitive change. In individuals without dementia, the occipital repetition effect has been linked to perceptual priming, while other repetition effects have been linked to conceptual priming (Fleischman et al., 2005). Consistent with the physiologic findings, conceptual priming is somewhat impaired earlier in AD, but perceptual priming is intact until quite late in AD (Keane, Gabrieli, Fennema, Growdon, &amp; Corkin, 1991).

Similarly, both occipital and non-occipital repetition effects have been linked to discrete electrophysiological profiles in event-related potential (ERP) experiments (Guo et al., 2007). Specifically, repetition effects at occipital cortex are traditionally associated with repetition reduction (i.e., smaller responses with repetition), similar to traditional repetition priming effects, but repetition effects at other cortices are typically associated with repetition enhancement (i.e., larger responses with repetition). Contemporary models of repetition effects hold that individual repetition effects may manifest as increased magnitude, decreased magnitude, altered latency, or some combination of these effects (Gotts et al., 2012; Gotts, Milleville, &amp; Martin, 2014; Grill-Spector, Henson, &amp; Martin, 2006; Henson, 2012; Henson &amp; Rugg, 2003; Henson, Rylands, Ross, Vuilleumeir, &amp; Rugg, 2004). The multimodal nature of repetition effects improves the utility of techniques with sufficient resolution in multiple dimensions so as to distinguish them. Namely, event-related potentials (ERPs) capture temporal and qualitative aspects of repetition effects while maintaining sufficient spatial sensitivity for gross spatial distinctions (Guo et al., 2007; Lawson, Guo, &amp; Jiang, 2007; Q. Li, Guo, &amp; Jiang, 2008; Race, Badre, &amp; Wagner, 2010). In this way, they may account for the various temporal and spatial manifestations of repetition effects.

One possible explanation for maintenance of behavioral performance in the context of a neurodegenerative process is cognitive plasticity, salutary or disordered change in function often resulting from neural damage (Becker et al., 1996; Scheff et al., 2013). As long as part of cortex is maintained and damage is gradual, maintenance of behavior is possible through compensatory neural mechanisms (Belleville et al., 2011). Given the contemporary understanding that most cortical regions are implicated in different aspects of their manifestation, repetition effects may benefit from more opportunities for functional plasticity during the disease process than is typical due to this plurality of instantiation (Grill-Spector et al., 2006). In other words, the availability of many neural mechanisms already sensitive to repetition effects in the pre-morbid state may account for special viability of plasticity supporting repetition effects. Based on behavioral data in persons with dementia, repetition effects remain intact even late in the disease process during moderate to severe dementia, when almost all non-occipital cortical sources have been severely damaged over a period of years (Broster et al., 2013). Given a synthesis of this information, we suggest that compensation by an occipital repetition effect would meet the theoretical profile necessary for behavioral maintenance of repetition effects in AD.

In this experiment, we assessed repetition effects associated with a delayed-match-to-sample task in healthy controls, individuals with aMCI, and individuals with mild AD. This task has previously been shown to be associated with maintained or enhanced behavioral repetition effects in the context of AD, and the ERPs generated by repetition effects of the paradigm have been linked to changes including those in prefrontal and occipital cortices (Broster et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2007; Yu, Li, Jiang, Broster, &amp; Li, 2016). Because the occipital cortex experiences change relatively late in AD, we hypothesized that the occipital repetition effect would exhibit cognitive plasticity such that it would exhibit repetition enhancement (i.e., coming to resemble the form of the frontal and temporal repetition effects in persons without impairment).

METHODS

Power Analysis

A priori power analysis was performed using G*Power to identify the sample size necessary to detect mixed interaction terms of moderate effect size or greater for the current study (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007). The analysis revealed that 30 participants would be necessary for 80% power to detect such effects.

Participants

46 age- and education-matched participants – 18 normal older control (NC), 15 participants with aMCI, 13 individuals with AD – were recruited directly from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer Disease Center (UK-ADC) cohort or from tertiary care memory (Table 1). Recruiting directly from memory clinics reduces the risk that cognitive effects observed result from non-AD memory impairment conditions such as thyroid or vitamin B12 deficiency (Jicha et al., 2008; Luck et al., 2007). NC participants were healthy UK-ADC cohort volunteers (n = 4) or referrals to the memory clinic for evaluation who did not receive a clinical diagnosis and were considered NC based on criteria listed below (n = 14). In keeping with contemporary clinical criteria (Albert et al., 2011; Arsenault-Lapierre et al., 2011; Lekeu et al., 2010; Reid &amp; Maclullich, 2006), aMCI was indicated by A) absence of dementia, B) absence of cognitive, clinical, or behavioral symptoms consistent with sources of non-amnestic cognitive impairment, and C) objective memory impairment evidenced by performance more than 1.5 standard deviations below age-standardized normal values on at least one of several memory measures including Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory (WMS-R), the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II), and the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT-5, Forms C &amp; D) (Table 1). AD was diagnosed using Alzheimer’s Disease Dementia Workgroup criteria, which hold, briefly, that insidious-onset dementia is present in the absence of another psychiatric or neurological condition (McKhann et al., 2011). All participants were recruited directly from the tertiary care setting and had received comprehensive work-up to rule-out other psychiatric or neurological causes of cognitive impairment. Individuals with AD and aMCI had been diagnosed within 12 months of data collection, all research participants had been evaluated clinically within 12 months of data collection, and all research participants were evaluated clinically on an annual basis to check for conversion to aMCI or AD. In other words, all participants were clinically evaluated both prior to and subsequent to research participation to confirm their clinical status. All participants were between age 65 and 90 with visual acuity better than 20/50 with corrective lenses in at least one eye. Exclusion criteria included history of stroke; epilepsy; head trauma; CNS infection, chronic infectious disease; psychiatric illness including substance abuse, major depression, or other mood disorder; or other neurological disease (Robert et al., 2006). Participants taking medications known to affect cognitive function, such as sedatives or opiates, were similarly excluded. Neuropsychological data of participants have been previously published in a manuscript analyzing behavioral results of this task and suggest that participants with AD were in the early stages of the disease (Broster et al., 2013).

All participants provided written informed consent before participation. This study was approved by the Institutional Research Board (IRB) of the University of Kentucky.

Measures and Procedures

Participants performed a hybrid delayed-match-to-sample/repetition (DMS-R) task that has been validated in human and nonhuman primate physiological studies while neurophysiological data was collected (Figure 1) (Guo et al., 2007; Jiang, Haxby, Martin, Ungerleider, &amp; Parasuraman, 2000; Miller &amp; Desimone, 1994; Miller, Erickson, &amp; Desimone, 1996). Incorporating both working memory and repetition effects into a single paradigm, as in the hybrid paradigm used in the current study, facilitates the interpretation of any interaction effects observed (Kennedy, Rodrigue, Head, Gunning-Dixon, &amp; Raz, 2009; Voss &amp; Paller, 2008, 2009). Participants memorized a sample cartoon image at the beginning of each trial and then indicated whether or not each of 5 serially presented objects matched the sample image via response box with the left or right hand, counterbalanced between participants (Snodgrass &amp; Vanderwart, 1980). One image matching the sample and exactly one nonmatching image were each tested exactly 2 or 3 times per trial, respectively, for 5 total test stimuli per trial (Howard, Howard, Dennis, &amp; Kelly, 2008). A consequence of this design is that subjects could never infer the identity of the final tested image, ensuring that the cognitive task upon test image presentation was uniform. Because this design also meant that there were half as many 3rd presentations as 1st or 2nd presentations, 2nd and 3rd presentations were aggregated before analysis. Images were presented in a pseudorandom order. The detail that each trial would test the matching stimulus at least twice and the nonmatching stimulus at least twice was not made explicit to participants. The differential working memory retrieval status of a given stimulus (i.e., whether each stimulus was a match or a nonmatch) was used as a probe of working memory while repetition of a given stimulus (i.e., initial test or subsequent test) was a probe of repetition effects. Each image was used in exactly one trial. 60 trials were performed altogether in two blocks of 30 trials each; as described previously, each trial consisted of 5 test stimuli. Each block lasted 5 minutes and 30 seconds. Participants took a short, self-paced break between blocks that typically lasted about 60 seconds. During this time researchers confirmed the comfort of participants and provided encouragement to participants. Pilot data suggested that persons with AD responded poorly to negative accuracy feedback during experimental protocols. Consequently, the protocol was modified so that participants would not receive accuracy feedback.

A 5-minute practice period preceded the entire experiment to ensure that participants were comfortable with the cognitive and motor components of the task. This practice period was also designed to reduce or eliminate the influence of motor learning confounds on any repetition effects. During the practice period a researcher remained in the experimental room with the participant and provided oral feedback related to performance. As in the 2 blocks of formal experimentation, computerized feedback was not provided.

Visual Stimuli

Stimuli were 230 two-dimensional, black-and-white 8.3 cm x 5.8 cm pictures of common objects presented with a black background (Snodgrass &amp; Vanderwart, 1980). All stimuli were presented on a high-resolution color monitor using E-prime software. Sample images were presented with a thick green outline for 3s, and each test stimulus was presented for 1.5s. Both individual images and individual trials were separated by a 1.1–1.4s jitter interval comprised of a white box identical in appearance to the Snodgrass images apart from absence of an object. The jitter was employed to prevent bias in reaction time (RT) measures due to participants anticipating stimulus onset. Stimuli were presented at a 65 cm visual distance at a visual angle of approximately 7°. Test images were normalized for image familiarity and complexity across retrieval status (Snodgrass &amp; Vanderwart, 1980).

Electrophysiological Data Preprocessing

Electrophysiological data were collected using NeuroScan 4.5 and a conventional 64-channel NeuroScan cap at a rate of 500 Hz with a single midline reference electrode on-line and simultaneous electrooculogram (Figure 2). Impedance was kept below 15 kΩ during experimentation. Data used in this experiment had been partially processed using SCAN 4.5 for reasons unrelated to the current manuscript. This preprocessing consisted of manual artifact rejection, ocular artifact reduction using NeuroScan’s proprietary regression algorithm, a finite impulse response filter with a band-pass of 0.05 to 40 Hz at 12 dB/octave, epoching at −100 to 1000 ms relative to participant exposure to each stimulus, baseline-correcting to the time-window from −100 to 0 ms relative to stimulus onset, and re-referencing from a midline online reference electrode to an averaged mastoid reference used in experiments similar to the current paradigm (Guo et al., 2007; Guo, Lawson, Zhang, &amp; Jiang, 2008; Lawson et al., 2007; J. Li et al., 2017). Then, epochs associated with accurate behavioral responses and electrophysiological activity within ± 75 μV of baseline were averaged for each of the 4 experimental conditions (i.e., the initial or non-initial presentation of matching or non-matching stimuli). All ERP cells for all participants included greater than 20 epochs prior to averaging with a potential maximum of up to 75 epochs for a given cell. On average, NC participants had 53, 81, 54, and 80 epochs for initial match, repeated match, initial non-match, and repeated non-match stimuli; MCI had 46, 71, 46, and 70 such epochs; and AD had 40, 63, 45, and 67 such epochs, respectively. For all participants, at least 80% of trials with a valid response were included in averaging, and all individual cells had at least 20 valid ERPs (Foti, Kotov, &amp; Hajcak, 2013; Keil et al., 2014; Levinson, Speed, Infantolino, &amp; Hajcak, 2017; Olvet &amp; Hajcak, 2009; Weinberg &amp; Hajcak, 2011).

Those files then underwent bad channel imputation using the ERP PCA Toolkit (EP Toolkit) to prepare the data for temporal PCA (Dien, 2010a). Promax and Infomax rotations were used for the temporal and spatial elements of the procedure, respectively, to permit limited correlation between temporal components, following the recommendation of methodologists (Dien, 2010b). To determine the appropriate number of temporal components to retain, the averaged data was compared to a random dataset, and components that explained both greater variance than the random dataset and at least 0.5% of variance in the data were retained. Principle components reflecting classical ERP signatures were identified using topographical maps of each component, each component’s temporal course, and the effect of the experimental manipulations on each component. A single PCA was used for all groups, subjects, electrodes, time-course, and conditions as previously defined. All procedures adhered to the recommendations in the ERP PCA Toolkit manual and tutorial (Dien, 2010a, 2012).

Data Analysis

Behavioral data analysis has been published separately and found that participants with aMCI showed greater reaction time (RT) differences between matching and non-matching stimuli and that participants with AD showed a greater difference in RT between initial and repeated stimuli than the other groups, indicating maintained or improved repetition effects in AD (Broster et al., 2013). The results are partially quoted in the Results section.

For the analysis of the PCA data, the a priori hypothesis was first evaluated. Temporal components were assessed using 2 × 2 × 3 robust ANOVAs on retrieval status (match or non-match), repetition (initial or repeated), and group (NC, MCI, or AD) using the EP Toolkit to identify a posteriorly-oriented component showing a Group × Repetition interaction distinguished by its manifestation in the AD group (Dien, 2010a, 2012). Subsequently, post-hoc robust ANOVAs were performed for all principle components using similarly-structured robust ANOVAs. To limit the effect of multiple comparisons on these tests, each ANOVA was conducted only at the peak electrode of the corresponding component, and these tests were supplemented with Bonferroni correction on the number of components tested, where the components to be tested were the components retained as described in Data Processing (Dien, 2010a, 2012). Uncorrected p value thresholds for each of these analyses are listed in the corresponding section of the online supplemental materials. Simple-effects models were used to interpret interaction effects. All significance values listed are based on two-tailed p values. For the sake of brevity, results failing to reach one-tailed significance (i.e., p &gt; 0.1) have been omitted from the report.

RESULTS

Behavioral Results

Behavioral effects have been analyzed in detail in a separate manuscript investigating behavioral sparing of repetition effects (Broster et al., 2013). Major themes included that persons with dementia had poorer accuracy, F[NC-AD] (1, 42) = 20.34, p &lt; 0.001, ηp2 = 0.33, F[MCI-AD] (1, 42) = 11.29 p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.18, but that all groups showed quickened reaction time with repetition, and that this effect was largest in persons with dementia, F(1, 42) = 3.94, p = 0.025, ηp2 = 0.09; that is, individuals with AD had spared or enhanced behavioral repetition effects (Table 2).

Conventionally-Averaged Waveform

After processing, the ERP waveforms showed normative characteristics including visual P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 peaks (Figure 3). To avoid drawing inappropriate conclusions from the overlap of co-occurring discrete components, temporal principal components analysis (PCA) was performed on the data before further statistical or informal inference. Details of this analysis are contained in the Methods.

Detailed analysis of the ERP waveform difference due to working memory was published separately and was found to differentiate MCI from NC via conventional ERP analysis (J. Li et al., 2017).

Temporal principal components analysis

To disentangle the effects of visually-overlapping ERP components, we applied temporal PCA to the data to increase the chance that statistical analysis would be conducted on discrete phenomena. Temporal PCA identified 27 temporal components that explained more variance than a random ERP dataset, of which 21 explained at least 0.5% of variance. Of these, the first component to be associated with latency unlikely to be modulated by the experimental manipulations was TF8, which had a latency of earlier than 100 ms. Hence, effects associated with TF8 or lower-order factors were not assessed in the current investigation. The first 7 temporal components, were associated with peak amplitudes at 458 ms, 272 ms, 162 ms, 672 ms, 354 ms, 208 ms, and 594 ms relative to presentation of a visual stimulus. The first component was linked to the classical P3 while the second and third components were linked to posterior and frontal variants of the P2, respectively. The remaining temporal components were linked to smaller mechanisms normally occluded by the more dominant waveforms constituting the conventionally-averaged ERP. Each of these first seven components has been presented at Fz and Pz (i.e., a frontal and posterior midline electrode, respectively) to provide a limited general sense of these components and their distribution (Figure 4), and a topological map of each component at the time-point of peak voltage has been included to provide additional information about the spatial distribution of each component (Figure 5).

A Priori Analysis

First, we assessed the a priori hypothesis that a posterior repetition mechanism would manifest uniquely in the AD group. Statistically, this was assessed by identifying an ERP component evidencing a significant interaction between the clinical group and repetition effect robust ANOVA factors.

The factor linked to the classical posterior P2, TF2, was associated with a significant interaction between clinical group and repetition, TWJt/c (2.0, 28.4) = 2.78, p = 0.04 (Figures 4,5). This was a positive-going, posteriorly-oriented component peaking at 272 ms maximal at PO6 at which individuals without impairment or with aMCI showed repetition decrement of about 0.4 – 0.5 μV, but individuals with AD showed repetition enhancement of about 0.7 μV, F (1,43) = 4.37, p = 0.02, ηp2 = 0.09 (Figure 5AB). This interaction was non-significant for other temporal factors (ps &gt; 0.1).

Post-Hoc Analysis

In addition to testing the a priori hypothesis, atheoretical post-hoc tests were performed by evaluating robust ANOVAs at the peak electrode of each temporal component. The purpose of these tests is to provide additional information about the manifestation of repetition and working memory effects in this cohort, even when the findings are not immediately relevant to the hypothesis at hand. For these analyses, Bonferroni correction was applied on the number of components evaluated, resulting in a significance threshold of 0.007 for post-hoc tests. Uncorrected p values have been recorded below.

The component linked to the classical P3, TF1, was associated with main effects of retrieval status, TWJt/c (1.0, 29.1) = 11.47, p = 0.0027, and repetition, TWJt/c (1.0, 33.3) = 40.50, p = 0.00002, such that non-match stimuli and repeated stimuli were associated with a more positive-going waveform. The component linked to the posterior P2, TF2, was associated with the effect described in the a priori hypothesis section above, but no further effects. The component linked to the frontal P2, TF3, was associated with a main effect of repetition, TWJt/c (1.0, 28.4) = 13.53, p = 0.001, such that repetition was associated with a more positive-going waveform. A late positive-going waveform, TF4, was associated with a main effect of retrieval status, TWJt/c (1.0, 42.1) = 35.05, p &lt; 0.00000001, such that distractor stimuli were associated with a more positive-going waveform. A component linked to somewhat earlier parts of the positive-going waveform in the P3 window, TF5, was associated with main effects of retrieval status, TWJt/c (1.0, 29.2) = 18.16, p = 0.00034, and repetition, TWJt/c (1.0, 37.4) = 13.53, p = 0.00062, such that match stimuli and repeated stimuli were associated with a more positive-going waveform. A component contributing to positive-going waveforms in the P2 time-window, TF6, was associated with a main effect of retrieval status, TWJt/c (1.0, 38.7) = 15.78, p = 0.00064, qualified by a significant retrieval status Χ repetition interaction, TWJt/c (1.0, 27.9) = 10.39, p = 0.0048, such that upon initial presentation distracter stimuli were associated with a more positive-going waveform, TWJt/c (1.0, 40.2) = 26.67, p &lt; 0.00000001, but upon subsequent presentation this difference was non-significant, TWJt/c (1.0, 31.4) = 2.25, p = 0.14. Finally, a component linked to positive-going waveforms during the later P3 time-window, TF7, was associated with a main effect of retrieval status, TWJt/c (1.0, 37.2) = 9.33, p = 0.0048, such that distracter stimuli were associated with a more positive-going waveform. Other main effects and interactions, including all those implicating group differences, were non-significant after Bonferroni correction. Figure 3 includes graphs of each of these temporal components at two midline electrodes. Means and standard deviations for the peak amplitude of each component by condition and group is included in Table 3.

Integrated Data Analyses

The repetition effect identified at temporal factor 2 was correlated with individual neuropsychological scores, behavioral accuracy, and behavioral reaction time (cf., Table 1). All such correlations were non-significant (ps &gt; 0.1).

DISCUSSION

Our results implicate an AD-related difference in an early, posterior repetition effect mechanism – whereas repetition was associated with a reduced effect at this site in participants without AD, it co-occurred with an enhanced behavioral repetition effects in participants with AD. The repetition enhancement in AD was consistent with the manifestation of this effect for frontally and temporally-oriented components (e.g., TF1, TF3, TF5). The sensitivity of the posterior mechanism to pathological cognitive aging (i.e., in the context of clinical dementia due to AD) departs somewhat from previous findings that the posterior repetition effect mechanism is robust to cognitive aging. Consistent with classical descriptions of the posterior mechanism, it was amodal with respect to stimulus retrieval status; that is, whether a stimulus was a working memory match or nonmatch did not significantly modulate the repetition effect waveform (Guo et al., 2007).

This finding mirrors some reports that individuals with AD show unique behavioral capabilities when handling short-lag repetition effects, even relative to individuals with milder impairment. Individuals with AD have been shown to disproportionately improve RT with repetition in this paradigm, and they have similarly been reported to benefit most from implicit learning in a weather prediction paradigm (Broster, Blonder, &amp; Jiang, 2012; Broster et al., 2013; Klimkowicz-Mrowiec et al., 2008). However, to the best of our knowledge, the maintenance or enhancement of these behavioral phenomena had not previously been linked to any particular neural mechanism.

In our opinion, the current finding suggests a solution for this issue. Even though persons with a clinical AD diagnosis have experienced widespread cortical damage, the relative sparing of the posterior cortex in general and the posterior repetition effect in particular during the course of the pathophysiology of AD may have allowed for a plastic response at that mechanism that accounts for behavioral sparing or enhancement of such effects. In other words, enhancement of the posterior repetition effect occurs due to damage to other repetition effects at parts of cortex damaged earlier in the course of AD, and this plasticity accounts for the relative sparing of repetition effects in AD.

Our finding may be related to a recent report of a potential middle occipital compensatory mechanism based on a similar paradigm conducted via fMRI (Yu et al., 2016). In that study persons with MCI showed repetition suppression changes at the middle occipital gyrus that were correlated to both reaction time and accuracy measures. In the current study, the phenomenon was observed only among individuals with early AD; however, this may have resulted in part from differences in the patient populations. For example, whereas in the current study persons with clinical MCI had quite robust MMSE scores, the MMSE scores of those in the fMRI study were nearer to those of our participants with early AD.

We note that despite their co-occurrence, individual differences in behavioral repetition effects and the posterior repetition effect identified in this study were not correlated at the level of the individual participant. In our opinion, this finding has only minimal impact on the plausibility of a relationship between the phenomena. This is because the cross-sectional nature of the current study and quasi-experimental nature of the participant groups are unable to predict a priori whether larger or smaller magnitudes in a particular temporal component are related directly to outcome differences. For example, larger magnitude of a compensatory mechanism at the individual level could be related to successful resource recruitment and better behavioral performance, but could also reflect a greater need for resources and hence poorer behavioral performance.

Typically, research on functional compensation in MCI or AD has been attributed to prefrontal sources, though the interpretation that this activity reflects compensation is not without controversy and includes changes in top-down control over attention during aging (Cooley et al., 2015; De Vogelaere, Santens, Achten, Boon, &amp; Vingerhoets, 2012; Frantzidis et al., 2014; Jacobs et al., 2015; Kaufman, Keith, &amp; Perlstein, 2016; L. Li, Gratton, Fabiani, &amp; Knight, 2013; Liang, Wang, Yang, Jia, &amp; Li, 2011; Qi et al., 2010). In the current study, we did identify a frontal repetition effect in the current study (TF3), but it was independent of both clinical status and retrieval status, contrary to some classical studies using the current paradigm with healthy participants (Guo et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Lawson et al., 2007). Of note, TF3 had an earlier time-course than the frontal, modality-dependent repetition effect identified in these classic studies. A frontal component with this latency and sensitivity pattern has not been previously discussed in studies using the current paradigm to our knowledge. However, studies of changes to visual processing and executive function in older adults have implicated orbitofrontal cortex in individual differences in a ERP component that occurs during the same time-window as this study’s TF3 (Kaufman, Keith, et al., 2016; Kaufman, Sozda, Dotson, &amp; Perlstein, 2016). Those authors further found that early frontal activity was associated with subsequent early posterior activity, perhaps reflective of TF2 in the current study (Kaufman, Keith, et al., 2016). Future directions could include source localization to ascertain the identity of these phenomena.

The novelty of the altered posterior repetition effect in the current study may be due to the uniqueness of the current cohort and experimental design. Most studies that have identified the potential frontal compensatory response have observed it in the context of normal aging or MCI, and studies that have purported to see it in individuals with dementia have been relatively inconsistent. Individuals with mild AD may show secondary cortical damage in frontal cortex relative to individuals with normal aging or MCI, which could account for secondary compensatory mechanisms at occipital cortex, which is relatively spared until individuals have moderate to severe dementia. If the altered posterior repetition effect represents compensation, it may reflect the need to manage neural resources given concurrent working memory processing demands on limited frontal resources.

Not all studies have reported that individuals with AD have intact or enhanced repetition effects (Leyton et al., 2014). In fact, many studies have reported that persons with AD have impaired repetition effects. A major variable differentiating many of the studies of repetition effects in AD is the amount of time-lag between repetitions in the paradigm. In addition to other sources of variation including modality and differences in the EEG topography of interest, studies that have shown repetition effect impairment in AD have tended to involve somewhat longer-lag repetition effects than the 10–12 second repetitions used in the current study, or the implicit task is correlated with an explicit one (Broster et al., 2013; Olichney et al., 2006; Olichney et al., 2002; Olichney et al., 2013; Olichney et al., 2008). In such cases, impairment seen in persons with AD may reflect explicit memory encoding deficits or primary explicit deficits, respectively, rather than a deficit in repetition effects per se, and those deficits may serve as useful diagnostic tools (Fleischman et al., 2005; Olichney et al., 2008).

In addition to the posterior repetition effect mechanism, the post-hoc analysis identified multiple independent temporal components capturing variance in time-windows classically linked to the P2, N2, P3, and LPC that showed unique types of repetition effects depending upon the temporal course of the component. For example, most components were associated with repetition enhancement (i.e., a more positive-going wave following repetition), but TF6 showed a retrieval status-dependent repetition suppression. These findings support the theory that the memory context of a repeated stimulus and the temporal and spatial location of a repetition effect mechanism can produce qualitatively-distinct signatures, as in the difference between models such as Bayesian explaining away, sharpening, or scaling models of repetition effects (Gotts et al., 2012; Grill-Spector et al., 2006). Further, the posterior repetition effect mechanism indicates that the cognitive status of an individual can also influence the quality of repetition effects within a given mechanism and stimulus type.

The current results are consistent with the clinical perspective that persons with AD may retain sufficient plasticity and brain function to benefit from appropriately-tailored interventions targeting cortex associated with the posterior repetition effect mechanism. Interventions with these characteristics exist and have apparent efficacy, but are not routinely prescribed (Hopper, 2003). This discrepancy has been linked to the early history of failed cognitive interventions in AD that focused on explicit interventions on the theory that the intervention should directly strengthen the impaired memory capacity. The current results provide a way to understand a potential mechanism for repetition effect-oriented cognitive interventions in AD.

The current cohort included a disproportionate number of women in the AD group. As a result, gender is a potential confound for differences related to the AD group in particular. We are unaware of any theoretical or empirical basis for attributing the current posterior repetition effect finding to gender; most gender differences in the pathophysiological of cognitive aging have been related to verbal capacities not relevant to the current paradigm (Broster et al., 2013). However, replication of the current finding with a gender-balanced cohort will be necessary to help rule-out this potential confound. Another potential confound was the potential influence of subclinical mood changes on measures. While all clinical groups showed GDS scores within the non-pathologic range and all individual participants were non-depressed, the patient groups did show significantly higher absolute scores on the GDS inventory. The influence of subclinical mood changes on cognitive outcomes in older adults or other with cognitive change could be an area of future work. Our experiment included patients who were receiving medical therapy for their dementia, some of which have well-characterized effects on EEG (Balkan et al., 2003; Brassen &amp; Adler, 2003). While this finding likely affected our results at the level of clinical groups, we suggest that our focus on Group X Condition interactions has limited the potential confounding influence of this factor. Finally, our experiment included a mild cognitive impairment group that we anticipate to be heterogeneous for stable MCI and MCI that heralds AD. Further characterizing these patients will be a further potential area of investigation.

In sum, we report that an “amodal” posterior repetition effect mechanism manifests in a qualitatively different fashion in persons with AD, perhaps reflecting plasticity secondary to cortical damage. We suggest that this phenomenon may account for the behavioral sparing or enhancement of repetition effects in the clinical course of AD for many empirical paradigms, including the paradigm used in the current study. We hope that the current results will contribute to a theoretical basis for believing that persons with AD retain a meaningful capacity to benefit from cognitive intervention (Vinogradov, Fisher, &amp; de Villers-Sidani, 2012).

Figure 1. The schematic represents a typical empirical trial. The z-axis represents time. First, a sample image with a green border was shown to the participant. After a jittered delay, the participant indicated whether each of a series of images matched or did not match the sample. Individual images were tested 2–3 times per trial. A new sample image and new distractor image were used in each trial.

Figure 2. Electrode montage for the current experiment. Note that an on-line reference electrode located along the midline between Cz and FCz and off-line mastoid reference electrodes were also used. Four electrooculogram electrodes were also placed to monitor eye blinks and saccades.&lt;/P/&gt; VEOG: vertical electrooculography; HEOG: horizontal electrooculography.

Figure 3. The conventionally-averaged event-related potentials of initial and repeated stimuli for the normal control (NC), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) groups showed normative features for visual experiments including typical P2, N2, and P3 components.

Figure 4. This figure shows the grand average of the first seven temporal factors (TFs) at Fz (top) and Pz (bottom) across all groups and conditions. Individual factors are color coded along a warm–cool axis in accordance with their ordinal factor number. In particular, please note the uniquely posterior orientation of the second temporal component (TF2). This component reaches its maximum amplitude of only 0.4 μV at Fz; consequently, it is inscrutable among the noise associated with other temporal factors at the frontal electrode.

Figure 5. These topographic plots show the distribution of voltages across the scalp for each temporal factor at time of maximum voltage for each component. Red color indicates more positive voltage at a particular scalp area. TF = temporal factor.

Figure 6. (a) This graph summarizes the unique posterior effect in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) group. The separate event-related potentials to the initial and subsequent presentation of stimuli are graphed for the normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD groups, and the difference waves between those conditions (subsequent – initial) are shown together in the bottom-right quadrant. Individuals with AD uniquely showed repetition enhancement. (b) This box-and-whiskers graph shows the five-point summary of the unique posterior effect. Positive values indicate that the secondary presentations of an image were associated with a larger amplitude than the initial presentation (i.e., 2nd &gt; 1st). The boxes depict the first quartile,median, and third quartile for the NC, MCI, and AD groups, respectively, while the error bars depict the minimum and maximum values for each group. Individuals with AD showed a more positive mean amplitude difference than the other groups.
