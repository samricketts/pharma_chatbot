SUMMARY

A major pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, is a significant reduction in the white matter connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, as well as in the correlated activity between anatomically corresponding bilateral brain areas. However, the underlying circuit mechanisms and the cognitive relevance of cross-hemispheric communication remain poorly understood. Here, we show that novelty discrimination behavior activates cross-hemispheric (CH) neurons and enhances homotopic synchronized neural oscillations in the visual cortex. CH neurons provide excitatory drive required for synchronous neural oscillations between hemispheres, and unilateral inhibition of the cross-hemispheric circuit is sufficient to impair synchronous oscillations and novelty discrimination behavior. In the 5XFAD and Tau P301S mouse models, cross-hemispheric communication is altered, and novelty discrimination is impaired. These data reveal a hitherto uncharacterized cross-hemispheric circuit in the visual cortex, establishing a causal link between this circuit and novelty discrimination behavior, and highlighting its impairment in mouse models of neurodegeneration.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), are increasingly considered to be large-scale network disruption disorders (Gaubert et al., 2019; Jafari et al., 2020; Palop and Mucke, 2016). Functional connectivity studies with voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) analyses suggest that the connectivity between anatomically corresponding regions of the two cerebral hemispheres, commonly known as homotopic areas, is decreased in subjects with AD, impacting multiple areas including the orbitofrontal, cingulate, insula, and occipital visual cortices (Cheung et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015). Consistent with this, electroencephalography (EEG) studies in AD subjects reveal a reduction in the coherence of 8–13 Hz oscillations between homotopic areas, including in the occipital visual cortex (Chen et al., 2015; Koelewijn et al., 2019; Meghdadi et al., 2021; Musaeus et al., 2019). Moreover, in nonmedicated AD subjects, the magnitude of this reduction in coherence correlates with the degree of clinical dementia (Chen et al., 2015). The cross-hemispheric correlations seen in VMHC and EEG are thought to be mediated by structural connections between the brain hemispheres via the corpus callosum, and diffusion tensor imaging studies find that the structural connectivity between brain hemispheres is reduced across the entirety of the corpus callosum and white matter in AD (Mito et al., 2018; Preti et al., 2012; Qiu et al., 2016). Furthermore, reduction in VMHC and volume of the corpus callosum not only correlate with each other in a brain area-specific manner but also correlate with overall memory deficits in AD, reinforcing a possible causal link between cross-hemispheric coherence disruption and memory impairments (Qiu et al., 2016). However, the circuit mechanisms underlying the reduction in functional connectivity and whether these alterations relate to specific cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases remain unclear.

Homotopic connectivity in visual cortices has been observed not only in humans, where it appears early in fetal development and persists in healthy adults, but also in animal models (Engel et al., 1991; Koolen et al., 2014; Matsui et al., 2016; Thomason et al., 2013). In the homotopic visual cortex, significant changes in structural connectivity and oscillatory coherence have been shown to occur during visual information processing, including bistable motion, visual perception, and object tracking (Bland et al., 2020; Engel et al., 1991; Gen et al., 2011; Genç et al., 2016). Moreover, a recent study using a delayed orientation recall task found that visual working memory is processed in both contralateral (contralateral with receptive field covering the stimuli) and ipsilateral visual cortex in human subjects (Zhao et al., 2021). In contrast, disruptions in cross-hemispheric callosal fibers impacts visual discrimination and novelty detection, as well as oscillatory coherence (Avvenuti et al., 2020; Levine and Calvanio, 1980; Sidtis et al., 1981; Sprague et al., 1985). Similar deficits in visual information processing have been observed in human patients and in mouse models of AD (Creighton et al., 2019; Moulin et al., 2004; Paxton et al., 2007; Quental et al., 2013). Thus, while it is tempting to speculate that CH neuronal circuits translate homotopic communication and coherence to support behavior (van der Knaap and van der Ham, 2011), to date, no cross-hemispheric circuit specific perturbations have been conducted to unravel their importance to novelty recognition and memory.

Here, we show that novelty discrimination behavior activated CH neurons and enhanced homotopic synchronized oscillations in the visual cortex (V1). Rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic tracing and circuit specific optogenetics revealed that bilateral homotopic CH neurons in V1 provide feedforward excitation to both excitatory neurons and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Further, circuit specific manipulations established that feedforward excitation by CH neurons is necessary for the synchronized oscillations between homotopic V1 and novelty discrimination behavior. Although mouse models of AD have several limitations (Drummond and Wisniewski, 2017), the 5XFAD and Tau P301S models recapitulate multiple aspects of structural, cellular &amp; molecular, and cognitive phenotypes observed in human AD (Oakley et al., 2006; Yoshiyama et al., 2007). For instance, synaptic degeneration is a robust correlate of cognitive impairments in human AD, and, interestingly, synaptic loss in both 5XFAD and Tau P301S mice is also temporally associated with learning and memory impairments (Adaikkan et al., 2019; Dejanovic et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2017; Pao et al., 2020). Thus we used older 5XFAD and Tau P301S mice, at which point they show severe loss of dendritic spine density in CH neurons, and observed impaired activation of these CH neurons and decreases in both cross-hemispheric synchrony and behavioral performance in both lines of mice.

RESULTS

Deficits in novelty discrimination are associated with altered activation of cross-hemispheric neurons in 5XFAD mice.

To find evidence supporting the hypothesis that a specific population of CH neurons underlies behaviorally relevant cross-hemispheric communication, we began by modifying a novel object recognition test to examine visual novelty discrimination in mice. As rodents have an innate preference for novelty, mice spent more time exploring a novel visual pattern when given a choice during a test session (Figure 1A, 1B). This preference was evident in the behavior of 6-month-old C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice, with mice exploring the novel visual cue significantly more (9.10±1.5 % total time) when tested 20min after the initial acquisition (5.20±0.92%) (Figure 1B, 1C). Mice however did not show clear preference when tested 24h after the initial acquisition (Figure S1A, S1B), suggesting that this paradigm leads to short-term memory formation.

We conducted a systematic examination of the expression of cFos, a marker of recently active neurons (Chen et al., 2020), in V1, the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of WT mice following novelty discrimination (Figure 1D, and Figure S1C). An additional group of mice subjected to a novel context was included to account for the general novelty experience. Cage mate mice that did not undergo any behavioral training served as naïve controls. We observed that novelty discrimination induced cFos activity in ~1% of total neurons in DG (in %; right DG, 1.211±0.20 Vs 0.488±0.111 in control; left DG, 1.019±0.097 Vs 0.513±0.173) and ~3% of total neurons in PFC (right PFC, 2.956±0.576 Vs 0.321±0.131; left PFC, 3.318±0.853 Vs 0.550±0.173), whereas cFos activity was significantly higher in V1 with ~5–6% of total neurons positive for cFos (right V1, 5.46±0.56 Vs 1.036±0.22; left V1, 6.09±0.492 Vs 1.008±0.22) (Figure 1D and Figure S1C). Consistent with these data, in a second cohort of mice, we again observed ~5 to 7% of the total neurons in V1 were activated by novelty discrimination (Figure S1D, S1E). In the novel context alone group, we observed ~1.5, ~2–4, &amp; ~4% of total neurons were cFos positive in right (DG, 1.642±0.129; PFC, 4.050±0.370; V1, 4.178±0.60) and left DG, PFC, and V1, respectively (DG, 1.421±0.219; PFC, 2.866±0.565; V1, 4.05±0.370) (Figure 1D and Figure S1C). We next asked whether neurons that project contralaterally are activated by the novel context or novelty discrimination behavior. Since the V1 exhibited the highest levels of cFos activation, we focused on V1 for subsequent experiments.

To specifically examine the activation of CH neurons, we virally labeled them by unilaterally injecting retrograde AAV (AAVrg) expressing Cre into right or left V1 followed by injecting Cre-dependent AAV expressing EYFP as a reporter in the contralateral V1 (Figure 1E, 1F, and Figure S1F). In a second cohort of mice, CH neurons were labeled by injecting AAVrg.tdTomato into the right V1, and AAVrg.GFP into the left V1 (Figure S1G, S1H). Both these viral approaches reliably labeled CH neurons; thus, we combined them in subsequent analyses. Notably, we found that a larger percentage of CH neurons were cFos+ following novelty discrimination (~29%) than a novel context alone (~8–9%) in right (in %, 29.349±3.874 in novelty discrimination Vs 9.321±3.10 in a novel context Vs 1.178±0.62 in control) and left V1 (29.819±2.459 Vs 8.6±2.90 Vs 0.665±0.420) (Figure 1E–1G). Next, we asked what percentage of cFos+ neurons are CH neurons, which again revealed a higher % of activation in novelty discrimination, with ~27–33% of total cFos+ CH neurons after novelty discrimination (right V1, 33.072±8.071; left V1, 27.886±6.303) compared with ~9–11% in a novel context (right V1, 9.588±3.028; left V1, 11.855±4.474) and ~3–5% in the naïve control group (right V1, 8.0±5.12; left V1, 5.33±3.692) (Figure 1H). Novelty discrimination resulted in a higher % of cFos positivity in the CH neurons, when compared with the novel context group which did not differ from controls (Figure 1H). Thus, novelty discrimination preferentially induced cFos activation in CH neurons in V1.

We next addressed whether 5XFAD mice, a commonly used AD mouse model (Oakley et al., 2006), show any impairments in novelty discrimination. Given that the reduction in cross-hemispheric coherence magnitude correlates with the degree of clinical dementia (Chen et al., 2015), we chose to examine novelty discrimination behavior in older 5XFAD mice (15-month-old). While the novelty discrimination behavior was evident in 15-month-old WT mice (Figure 1I, 1J), 5XFAD were impaired (% time during acquisition Vs test; 6.483±0.637 Vs 9.356±1.15 in WT, &amp; 7.47±1.436 Vs 5.00±1.37 in 5XFAD) (Figure 1I, 1J and Figure S1I), consistent with novel object recognition and location memory deficits in 5XFAD (Creighton et al., 2019). This defect in novelty discrimination in 5XFAD could not be attributed to differences in their locomotor or spatial orientation bias as measured by their comparable velocity and head orientation during the test (Figure S1J, S1K). To assess novelty discrimination behavior induced-activity in 5XFAD, we again analyzed the expression of cFos in the virally labeled CH neurons (Figure 1K). There was no difference in the baseline cFos activity levels between WT and 5XFAD (Figure S1L, S1M), and novelty discrimination induced cFos activation in both WT (baseline Vs behavior; right V1, 1.444±0.412 Vs 15.281±1.50; left V1, 1.33±0.408 Vs 15.781 ±1.70) and 5XFAD (right V1, 2.00±0.577 Vs 19.625±3.04; left V, 2.222±0.596 Vs 20.34±3.54). Interestingly, we observed that novelty discrimination resulted in fewer cFos+ expression in CH neurons in both right (in %: 12.365± 2.620 Vs 29.746±3.016 in WT) and left V1 in 5XFAD (14.551±3.526 Vs 28.908±3.355 in WT) (Figure 1M). Thus, while the overall cFos levels are comparable between WT and 5XFAD following novelty discrimination, the pattern of activity or ensemble of neurons that are recruited in this behavior is significantly different between the control and AD mice.

Homotopic cross-hemispheric neurons provide feedforward excitatory drive.

We sought to understand the input-output connectivity of CH neurons and cross-hemispheric communication. Although previous studies suggest that CH neurons in the visual cortex are homotopic and their dendritic spines exhibit calcium transients (Buhl and Singer, 1989; Lee et al., 2019), it remains unknown if CH neurons have functional contralateral synaptic connections as presynaptic partners in adult mice. To address this, we employed cell-type specific rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic tracing in combination with a transgenic Cre driver mouse line targeting PV-interneurons (Figure 2A). We injected two helper AAVs into right V1 followed by an injection of RvdG-4mCherry(EnvA) into the same location 2w later (Figure 2A). As validation, we examined whether PV-interneurons received monosynaptic input from the lateral geniculate nucleus as shown in previous reports (Kim et al., 2016), and indeed found that PV-interneurons in V1 receive monosynaptic input from the geniculate nucleus (Figure S2A, S2B), as well as local inputs within ipsilateral V1 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, we observed that PV-interneurons in right V1 also receive monosynaptic input contralaterally from CH neurons, as reflected by mCherry+ rabies-labeled neurons in left V1, and these CH neurons were present across all cortical layers (327 neurons/10 mm2) (Figure 2B–2D). Further, to ensure these projections were bidirectional, in a second cohort of PV-Cre mice we injected helper AAVs and rabies viruses into left V1 and observed that PV-interneurons in left V1 also receive monosynaptic input from CH neurons (Figure S2C). Next, to ascertain the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory CH neurons, mCherry+ rabies-labeled neurons were co-labelled with a general inhibitory interneuron marker, GAD67. This revealed that only 1.06% (2 GAD67:mCherry double+ out of 188 mCherry+ neurons) of the CH neurons were GABAergic (Figure 2E). Further analysis revealed that axonal fibers of CH neurons cross via the corpus callosum (Figure 2B).

To test whether excitatory neurons also receive monosynaptic input from CH neurons, we replicated monosynaptic rabies tracing in CaMKIIa-Cre mice (Figure 2F). We found CH neurons provide monosynaptic input to excitatory neurons, and that this is present across all cortical layers (296 neurons/6 mm2) (Figure 2G, 2H, and Figure S2C). Similar to the results in the PV-Cre mice, co-labeling analyses found that 1.83% (2 GAD67:mCherry double+ out of 109 mCherry+ neurons) of these neurons were GABAergic (Figure 2I). To understand whether rabies virus tracing is biased toward excitatory CH neurons, we used pan-neuronal retrograde AAV to virally label CH neurons. We again observed 1.07% of CH neurons were GAD67+ (Figure S2D). Therefore, CH neurons provide input to excitatory neurons and PV-interneurons and are predominantly non-GABAergic.

To further validate the monosynaptic nature of these connections, we performed whole-cell recordings and optogenetic manipulation in acute ex vivo brain slices. To allow for visualization of pyramidal neurons and PV-interneurons in the right V1 and the corresponding activation of CH neurons in the left V1, we co-injected the Cre-dependent mCherry expressing AAV and channelrhodopsin-2 expressing AAVrg into the right V1 in PV-Cre mice (Figure 2J). After 3w of AAV expression, both PV-interneurons and pyramidal neurons were recorded in voltage-clamp, while CH neurons were concurrently activated using 473 ηm light (Figure 2J). We observed that activation of CH neurons evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at −70 mV, in both pyramidal neurons and PV-interneurons (Figure 2K, 2L). These findings indicate that CH neurons provide monosynaptic input and drive robust feed-forward excitation. To ensure these projections were bidirectionally functional, optogenetic activation was targeted to right V1 in a subset of ex vivo slices, which also robustly evoked EPSCs in neurons in the contralateral left V1 (Figure S2E, S2F). Together, these results indicate that homotopic V1 are strongly bilaterally connected by monosynaptic contralateral excitatory inputs.

As the synaptic inputs to these CH neurons play an important role in circuit function, we next asked if CH neurons receive input from local ipsilateral V1. We unilaterally injected AAVrg.Cre into left or right V1 and 2w later helper AAVs into the contralateral V1. An additional 2w later, rabies virus was unilaterally injected into the helper AAV injected V1 hemisphere (Figure 2M). These data revealed mCherry+ presynaptic neurons (mCherry+:EGFP-, 376 neurons/3 mm2) across all cortical layers (Figure 2N–2P), as well as neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (Figure S2G), demonstrating CH neurons receive monosynaptic input from all layers of ipsilateral V1 and the thalamus (Figure S2H). In V1, we observed that the presynaptic neurons were both excitatory neurons and PV-interneurons (Figure 2Q). To validate the monosynaptic nature of PV-interneurons input to CH neurons we performed whole-cell recordings and found that optogenetic activation of PV-interneurons indeed evoked robust IPSCs in the CH neurons (Figure 2R, 2S, and Figure S2I). Together, these findings suggest that the CH neurons, present across all layers of V1, receive monosynaptic input from all layers of V1, and also provide monosynaptic excitatory input contralaterally to both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

To assess whether connectivity in CH neurons is altered in 5XFAD, we labeled spines of CH neurons and examined dendritic spine density (Figure S2J). We observed that the size of the dendrites used for spine quantifications did not differ between WT and 5XFAD in either right (in μm; 1.101±0.04143 in 5XFAD Vs 1.246±0.054 in WT) or left V1 (1.207±0.083 Vs 0.979±0.145) (Figure 2T, 2U). However, the dendritic spine density of CH neurons in both right (0.837±0.015 spines/μm) and left V1 (0.848±0.013 spines/μm) was reduced in 5XFAD compared to the WT mice (right V1, 1.019±0.015 spines/μm; left V1, 0.93±0.012 spines/μm) (Figure 2T, 2V). Additionally, we observed amyloid plaque accumulation around the collateral axonal fibers of CH neurons in the 5XFAD group (Figure S2K, S2L). Collectively, these data show structural alterations in CH neurons in 5XFAD.

Cross-hemispheric gamma synchronization during novelty discrimination is altered in 5XFAD mice.

We next asked whether the engagement of CH neurons in V1 was accompanied by changes in cross-hemispheric communication. Toward this aim, we custom-built neural recording probes that allowed us to perform in vivo bilateral local field potential (LFP) and multiunit recordings from both left and right V1 simultaneously (Figure 3A). We first computed the mean spike-field coherence (SFC), a frequency-dependent synchronization index that detects how well neuronal spikes are locked to LFP oscillations. In C57BL6/J mice, multiunit spikes showed a significant increase in SFC in the gamma band (30–50 Hz) during novelty acquisition and discrimination compared to baseline conditions (Figure 3B, 3C and Figure S3A, S3B). We observed this increase in SFC both within and across the hemispheres of V1 (Figure 3B, 3C and Figure S3A, S3B). Further, we also observed a prominent peak in SFC in theta band (4–12 Hz), and it was significantly increased between the homotopic regions of V1 during both acquisition and discrimination (Figure 3B, 3C and Figure S3A, S3B). We next examined whether novelty discrimination induces changes in cross-hemispheric LFP synchronization in V1 (Figure 3D, 3E). Novelty discrimination enhanced phase locking (PLV) between the right and left V1 in the theta (0.891±0.025, 0.960±0.012, 0.948±0.025 PLV during baseline, novelty acquisition and discrimination, respectively) and gamma bands (0.293±0.016, 0.452±0.037, 0.455±0.032 PLV) (Figure 3E). These results suggest an involvement of CH neurons in neural synchrony during novelty acquisition and discrimination behaviors.

We then asked whether 5XFAD also exhibit an increase in homotopic oscillatory synchronization during novelty discrimination. Quantification of the modulation of multiunit spiking in one hemisphere of V1 by LFP oscillations recorded on the contralateral side revealed significant differences in spike-LFP coherence, with lower coherence at gamma frequency evident in the AD model mice across baseline, novelty acquisition and test (Figure 3F, 3G), despite peak theta and gamma oscillation frequencies remaining comparable across groups (Figure S3C, S3D). As shown in Figure 3H, time-resolved wavelet scalograms illustrate prominent theta and gamma oscillations during visual novelty acquisition. Across all mice, the 5XFAD group displayed reduced 4–12 Hz theta phase locking compared to WT mice in the home cage control condition (0.803±0056 in 5XFAD Vs 0.943±0.027 in WT) (Figure 3I), however; during visual novelty acquisition (0.956± 0.021 Vs 0.970±0.016) and test (0.836± 0.036 Vs 0.922±0.018), theta phase locking was overall higher and comparable between groups (Figure 3I). Further, gamma oscillations (30–50 Hz) in the home cage condition displayed reduced phase locking in 5XFAD (0.280±0.014 in 5XFAD Vs 0.358±0.015 in WT) (Figure 3J). Interestingly, novelty acquisition (5XFAD Vs WT, 0.359± 0.026 Vs 0.486±0.023) and discrimination (0.351±0.023 Vs 0.446±0.026) increased gamma phase locking in both WT and 5XFAD compared to the baseline in the respective groups, however, the overall gamma phase locking remained lower in 5XFAD (Figure 3J). Although PLV is resistant to changes in spectral power, we characterized the LFP spectral power. We observed a decrease in theta power in both the right and left V1 in the 5XFAD group (Figure 3K). LFP gamma power showed a non-significant trend in the baseline and no difference during the novelty discrimination behavior in 5XFAD (Figure 3K).

Given the co-occurrence of theta and gamma in V1 and reports of a preferential increase in theta-gamma coupling in visual cortical areas in healthy human subjects during a visual task (Tort et al., 2009; Voytek et al., 2010) and in non-human primates (Kienitz et al., 2021; Spaak et al., 2012), we examined theta-gamma coupling between hemispheres. We found that gamma preferentially occurred around the trough of both ipsilateral and contralateral theta in WT mice, whereas it was distributed more broadly across theta phases in 5XFAD (Figure S3E, S3F). To rule out that animal velocity was driving the changes observed in the oscillatory coupling, we compared the genotypes. While the mean velocity did not differ between WT and 5XFAD (Figure S3G), there was a trend for increases in angular velocity of head orientation in the 5XFAD which did not reach statistical significance (Figure S3H).

Cross-hemispheric circuit is altered in Tau P301S mice.

Next, we sought to determine whether these findings in the 5XFAD mice are observed in other mouse models of neurodegeneration or were restricted to amyloid plaque mouse models. To address this, we used 9.5-month-old PS19 Tau P301S mice (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). First, we observed that Tau P301S (% time exploring during acquisition Vs test; 7.083±0.737 Vs 7.698±1.197) were also impaired in the novelty discrimination compared to WT littermates (8.127±1.064 Vs 14.347±2.32) (Figure 4A–4C) without noticeable changes in their locomotor or spatial orientation bias as measured by their comparable velocity and head orientation during the test (Figure S4A, S4B). Next, we virally labeled CH neurons, and co-labelled them with Ser202/Thr205 phosphorylated tau protein, and found that ~26–38% CH neurons were AT8 immunoreactive (Figure S4C, S4D). Although AT8 immunodetection has been widely used, AT8 does not distinguish between pre-tangle and tangle forms of tau (Moloney et al., 2021). We thus performed additional staining using Congo-Red, which has previously been validated to assess tangle-like inclusions in P301S (Yoshiyama et al., 2007). Consistently, we observed Congo-Red+ tangle-like inclusions in CH neurons in Tau P301S (Figure S4E). Furthermore, dendritic spine density in CH neurons in Tau P301S in the right (1.087±0.027 spines/μm) and left V1 (0.916±0.011 spines/μm) was reduced compared to age matched WT littermates (right V1, 1.201±0.0181 spines/μm; left V1, 1.03±0.0141 spines/μm) (Figure 4D, 4E). We next analyzed the expression of cFos to assess novelty discrimination induced activity (Figure 4F). We found no difference in the baseline cFos activity levels between WT and Tau P301S (Figure S4F, S4G). We also did not detect significant differences in the total number of cFos+ cells between the WT and Tau P301S groups after the novelty discrimination (Figure S4H). Notably, we observed that novelty discrimination behavior resulted in significantly fewer CH neurons expressing cFos+ in both right (in %: 14.921±4.411 Vs 27.104±4.031 in WT) and left V1 in Tau P301S (10.464±2.6 Vs 26.636±2.745) (Figure 4F, 4G).

We asked whether Tau P301S also exhibit changes in homotopic oscillatory synchronization. We observed lower SFC coherence at both theta and gamma frequency evident in both baseline and during novelty acquisition in the Tau P301S (Figure 4H, 4I). Next, we focused on the LFPs and observed prominent theta and gamma band oscillations in both WT and Tau P301S (Figure 4J–4L). Tau P301S group displayed reduced 4–12 Hz cross-hemispheric theta phase locking compared to WT mice across the home cage control (0.717±0.030 in Tau P301S Vs 0.897±0.024 in WT), visual novelty acquisition (0.825±0.023 Vs 0.906±0.015) and test (0.848±0.023 Vs 0.937±0.021) (Figure 4K). In contrast, phase locking of gamma band oscillations did not differ in the home cage condition (Tau P301S Vs WT, 0.257±0.034 Vs 0.319±0.010), however displayed reduced values during the acquisition (0.320±0.036 Vs 0.405±0.023) and test (0.324±0.039 Vs 0.430±0.011) in Tau P301S (Figure 4L). Further, while WT mice had increased gamma PLV between hemispheres of V1 during both the acquisition and test compared to home cage baseline, Tau P301S mice failed to show such increases, presumably as a result of the altered connectivity and reduced activation of CH neurons during this behavior as shown in Figure 4E–4G. LFP power spectra revealed that the overall theta and gamma power were reduced in Tau P301S (Figure 4M), though this was only the case for 8–12 Hz range, and not the 4–8 Hz theta band in Tau P301S. Finally, as theta and gamma power have been shown to vary across cortical depths (Kienitz et al., 2021; Senzai et al., 2019), we investigated how LFP power changed across the cortical depths of V1, and observed slightly more gamma power in layers 2/3 and layer 4 compared with deep layers. These results demonstrate that while Tau P301S showed overall reductions in theta and gamma power, the laminar distribution of LFPs were comparable to that of WT (Figure 4N).

Inhibition of cross-hemispheric neurons impairs homotopic gamma synchrony and novelty discrimination.

We sought to establish whether CH neurons mediated the enhanced synchrony observed in vivo and if they are necessary for novelty discrimination. To achieve this, AAVrg.syn.Cre was injected into either right or left V1, followed 3w later by Cre-dependent AAV-expressing hM4D(Gi).mCherry delivered to the contralateral V1 hemisphere (Figure 5A, 5B). 2w after viral infusion, we implanted recording probes targeting bilateral V1. hM4D(Gi)-mediated inhibition of CH neurons did not alter overall LFP power (Figure 5C–5E), but reduced gamma (right V1 hM4D(Gi), 0.277±0.021 Vs 0.322±0.027 in control; left V1 hM4D(Gi), 0.236±0.012 Vs 0.318±0.017), and dislayed a trend for reduced theta synchrony (right V1 hM4D(Gi), 0.841±0.019 Vs 0.902±0.025 in control; left V1 hM4D(Gi), 0.815±0.027 Vs 0.871±0.020) between right and left V1 (Figure 5C, 5F). Consistent with this, cross-correlation of Hilbert transformed analytical homotopic LFPs revealed a reduction in correlation coefficients at gamma (peak correlation coefficient, right V1, 0.520±0.028 Vs 0.436±0.028 under inhibition; left V1, 0.479±0.037 Vs 0.346±0.042) and theta frequencies (right V1, 0.941±0.011 Vs 0.877±0.019; left V1, 0.926±0.006 Vs 0.756±0.062) following inhibition of CH neurons (Figure 5G, and Figure S5A, S5B). Using our laminar LFP data we next performed current source density (CSD) analyses to probe the extent to which the cortical layers share sink-source relationship between right and left V1 (Figure 5C; middle panel). We observed a strikingly similar CSD profile between right and left V1 in both theta and gamma frequencies in the control condition. Further, while inhibition of CH neurons did not affect the CSD sink-source relationship across cortical layers within each V1, it altered the temporal CSD relationship between right and left V1 (Figure 5C; middle panel). Further, when we compared the CSD profile of WT and Tau P301S, WT littermates showed a similar CSD profile between right and left V1 in both theta and gamma bands (Figure 5H), whereas in Tau P301S, layers 4 and 6 were no longer coordinated across right and left V1 (Figure 5H).

To establish the impact of the reduced neural synchrony after the inhibition of CH neurons on single neurons, we calculated the phase relationship between ipsilateral and contralateral V1 gamma and spikes from narrow spiking and regular spiking single units recorded in the hemisphere contralateral to the inhibition (Figure 5I and Figure S5C, S5D). While inhibition of CH neurons did not affect the mean firing rate of neurons (Figure S5E), it reduced the strength of LFP gamma phase locking of neurons, seen as a reduction in the mean resultant length (spikes-ipsilateral LFP: 0.106±0.013 &amp; 0.081±0.013 Vs 0.186±0.024 &amp; 0.165±0.024 in control in regular and narrow spiking neurons respectively. Spikes-contralateral LFP: 0.104±0.015 &amp; 0.061±0.043 Vs 0.132±0.021 &amp; 0.0965±0.020) (Figure 5J, 5K). Similarly, inhibition of CH neurons affected theta phase locking of spikes (spikes-ipsilateral LFP: 0.106±0.017 &amp; 0.061±0.008 Vs 0.153±0.022 &amp; 0.094±0.011. Spikes-contralateral LFP: 0.094±0.018 &amp; 0.042±0.008 Vs 0.121±0.021 &amp; 0.096±0.014) (Figure 5L). These findings suggest that the CH neurons form a functional homotopic circuit which mediates CH oscillatory synchronization.

To assess the relevance of CH neurons to novelty discrimination behavior, we examined how activation or inhibition of CH neurons altered behavior. First, we expressed activator hM3D(Gq) or Cre as control in CH neurons in 5XFAD (Figure S5F). Mice were injected with CNO 20min before the novelty discrimination behavior. We observed that 5XFAD expressing hM3D(Gq) showed altered baseline behavior, manifest as a significant increase in angular velocity after CNO administration (Figure S5F–S5I), confounding behavioral analysis in the task. We thus turned to inhibitory DREADDs and expressed Cre or hM4D(Gi) in the CH neurons in WT mice (Figure 5A). All mice were injected with CNO 20min before the novelty discrimination behavior. While control WT mice exhibited a preference for the novel pattern, we found that the unilateral inhibition of CH neurons in the right or left V1 impaired novelty discrimination (% time exploring during acquisition Vs test; 7.15±0.89 Vs 9.54±1.05, 6.75±0.85 Vs 6.05±1.2, &amp; 5.17±0.79 Vs 4.85±1.01 in control, right V1 hM4D(Gi) &amp; left V1 hM4D(Gi), respectively) (Figure 5M, 5N and Figure S5J). This defect in novelty discrimination after the inhibition of CH neurons could not be attributed to confounding factors such as locomotor activity or spatial orientation bias, as there were no group differences in velocity and angular velocity during the test (Figure S5K, S5L). Although, this later perturbation is specific to the CH circuits, CH neurons may have other projections or synaptic partners. Thus, to specifically examine whether the projection to the contralateral hemisphere is critical for the visual novelty discrimination, we optogenetically inhibited the axonal terminals of CH neurons. We expressed eNpHR3.0 in CH neurons, mice were implanted with a fiber optic probe unilaterally in the axonal terminal side of the CH neurons, and 532 ηm light was applied unilaterally to inhibit the terminals (Figure 5O). We found that the unilateral optogenetic inhibition of axons of CH neurons in the right or left V1 impaired novelty discrimination (% time exploring during acquisition Vs test; 6.261±0.909 Vs 9.188±1.054, 7.659±1.028 Vs 6.741±0.824, &amp; 7.034±1.003 Vs 6.734±0.679 in control, right V1 eNpHR3.0 &amp; left V1 eNpHR3.0, respectively) (Figure 5P,5Q and Figure S5M) but did not result in differences in velocity and angular velocity during the novelty discrimination test (Figure S5N, S5O). Together, these results show that chemogenetic inhibition of CH neurons or optogenetic inhibition of the projections of CH neurons unilaterally is sufficient to impair novelty discrimination behavior.

DISCUSSION

Our findings reveal a hitherto uncharacterized cross-hemispheric circuit in V1 that regulates synchronized homotopic oscillatory activity and plays an important role in visual novelty discrimination behavior.

Previous studies in mice have demonstrated that within the homotopic PFC the regulation of gamma synchrony between PV-interneurons is important for behavioral adaptation (Cho et al., 2020), and in non-human primates the dynamics of theta across the homotopic prefrontal cortex broadly correlate with gamma during working memory tasks (Brincat et al., 2021). Our results show enhanced theta and gamma synchrony during visual novelty discrimination in homotopic V1, together with direct evidence that homotopic synchronized oscillations arise as a result of a CH anatomical circuit. CH neurons are poised to regulate specific populations of contralateral neurons and further impact the interaction between cortical layers and eventually behavioral performance. Our findings in two widely used models of neurodegeneration showed that reduced activation of CH neurons, altered dendritic spines of CH neurons and impaired synchronized oscillations between homotopic V1 closely associate with impaired behavioral performance. The observed involvement of a bilateral homotopic circuit supports the idea that both cerebral hemispheres co-operatively function when behavioral experience (short-term memory) occurs in a naturalistic state.

In terms of study limitations, we first considered whether a defective visual system in AD mice could confound the observed findings. We had previously shown that visual flicker stimulations in both 5XFAD and Tau P301S was sufficient to entrain 40 Hz gamma (Adaikkan et al., 2019; Iaccarino et al., 2016), suggesting that these mice have functioning visual systems, and in addition, neuronal activity marker labeling also showed that the novelty discrimination behavior induced activity levels in these mice that are comparable to the respective WT littermates, thereby making it unlikely that visual system deficits were contributing to the neurophysiological and novelty discrimination behavioral impairments we observed. Next, despite the fact we observed AD mice recapitulating cross-hemispheric theta synchrony deficits reported in human subjects with dementia, the mice used in this study are reflective of more advanced AD-associated pathological states. Therefore, while we cannot conclude whether the behavioral and CH circuit disruptions are dependent or independent of the amyloid and/or tau phosphorylation, the data would be consistent with the view that synaptic degeneration and neural circuit dysfunction correlate well with memory dysfunction (Jackson et al., 2019). Also, there is great interest in the field to evaluate whether EEG/LFP spectral power can predict AD, and whether it can be used as a biomarker. Our electrophysiological analyses were conducted when animals were awake and active, either in their home cage or during the novelty discrimination behavioral task, which revealed an overall reduction in theta in both 5XFAD and Tau P301S. Gamma band power, while not different (albeit slightly higher) in 5XFAD, was reduced in Tau P301S. A previous study also reported a reduction in gamma within the olfactory bulb of 9-month-old Tau P301S (Ahnaou et al., 2020). Further, under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia, 6-month-old 5XFAD exhibit differential effects on LFP gamma with reduced power in CA1 and increased power in the dentate gyrus (Zhen et al., 2017). Despite the differences and directionality in LFP power in these mouse models, the decreased cross-hemispheric synchrony was consistent. Thus, alterations in neural synchrony might better reflect cognitive function in neurodegeneration.

Although there are reports of the existence of theta oscillations in the visual cortices of rodents and non-human primates (Kienitz et al., 2021; Lensjø et al., 2017; Senzai et al., 2019; Spyropoulos et al., 2018), and that the lesioning of V1 eliminates theta, but not gamma, in the downstream brain area V4 in non-human primates (Kienitz et al., 2021), whether theta observed in V1 are genuine locally generated oscillations or volume conductance from the hippocampus is still debated (Spyropoulos et al., 2018). We consistently observed prominent theta and gamma oscillations. In addition, multiunit spikes also exhibited theta modulation in bilateral V1. Further, under baseline conditions, the overall strength of phase locking of single units to LFP theta and gamma was comparable. Are theta oscillations then genuine in the V1? We speculate that theta oscillations in V1 are likely to be genuine. Future studies will investigate the source of the theta in the V1. Given the focus of the study, other frequency bands of oscillations warrant further detailed investigation; however, our data show their alterations in AD mice, and furthermore, during novelty discrimination behavior SFC and wavelet coherence in beta band are also impacted. Thus, several bands of oscillations, not exclusively theta and gamma, are communicating between hemispheres through CH neurons during novelty discrimination behavior.

In summary, our study is one of the few studies in which neural oscillations in the visual cortex were characterized while animals explored visual novelty in an unrestrained and naturalistic behavioral state (Ji and Wilson, 2007; Lensjø et al., 2017). We demonstrate that engaging animals in novelty acquisition and discrimination behavior activates CH neurons and enhances synchronous oscillations in the homotopic V1. As with the 5XFAD and Tau P301S models of neurodegeneration, CH neuronal inhibition alone also reduced phase locking of neural oscillations and spike coherence of LFP oscillations between homotopic V1, and these reductions were robustly associated with deficits in novelty discrimination. Together, our data suggest that cross-hemispheric oscillatory coupling is important for the temporal organization of visual inputs, particularly in novelty acquisition and novelty discrimination.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

All experiments were approved by the Committee for Animal Care of the Division of Comparative Medicine at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), conformed to NIH and institutional guidelines and were carried out at MIT. C57BL6/J, CaMKIIa-Cre (B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-cre)T29–1Stl/J) (Jackson Labs, Stock#005359), 5XFAD (B6.Cg-Tg(APPSwFlLon,PSEN1*M146L*L286V)6799Vas/Mmjax) (Jackson Labs, MMRRC Stock#34848-JAX), Tau P301S-tg: B6;C3-Tg(Prnp-MAPT*P301S)PS19Vle/J, and PV-Cre (B6.129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J) (Jackson Labs, Stock#17320) were obtained from the Jackson laboratory. All transgenic mice were bred and maintained in our animal facility. Mice were genotyped as described previously. All mice were aged between 2 and 15 months prior to commencement of experiments. Mixed male and female 5XFAD with age and sex matched WT littermates were used for electrophysiology experiments. We used male 5XFAD for behavioral experiments, and female 5XFAD mice for immunohistochemical analyses. All Tau P301S mice used were males. Mice were group housed (2– 5 mice per cage) except those that were implanted with electrophysiology probes. All experiments were done using age-matched littermates. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. during the light cycle. We handled all animals for 2– 3 days before the experiments to reduce acute stress levels.

METHOD DETAILS

Visual novelty discrimination behavior

We used a custom designed arena (dimensions: length = 600 mm, width = 460 mm and height = 300 mm). A removable vertical or horizontal plastic bar board was attached to the walls on the long side of the arena, creating a visual pattern. The visual novelty discrimination test involved one novelty acquisition session and one test session. During the novelty acquisition session, mice were introduced into this arena, whereby the novelty acquisition refers to exploration within the novel context. We tracked head and body positions of mice as they performed the task using Noldus (Ethovision XT, Noldus Information Technology) for 12 min. Mice were then placed back in their home cages for 20 min before being subjected to the test trial. During the test, mice were re-introduced into the same arena, which now additionally contained one novel bar occupying one-third of one wall (i.e. 200 mm), and were tracked using head and body points for 6 min for further off-line analyses. For behavioral scoring, automated analyses were done examining time spent exploring the patterns during the acquisition and test sessions. The criteria to determine whether mice were actively exploring the novel pattern required the mouse to be within a set boundary/distance from the novel pattern (i.e., the rectangular area near the novel pattern) and with the head oriented toward the novel pattern. This method is similar to novel object recognition scoring. For visualization purposes, we used occupancy heatmap. To further validate that animals were actively exploring the arena and novel pattern across the trial duration we analyzed time exploring novel pattern for each time bin of 20 seconds. Animal velocity and heading direction for assessing motor function and spatial orientation were analyzed in Ethovision XT using inbuilt functions. Analyses were done by an experimenter blinded to the treatment conditions. In the time series behavioral data, we averaged across all the mice in each group for specific time bin, and the corresponding graph represents mean±standard error of the mean. Based on our pilot experiments, the task is a bit more difficult than a novel object recognition test. Expectedly, younger animals (Figure 1B, 1C) performed better than aged animals (Figure 1I) in this test.

c-Fos labelling in CH neurons after novel context and novelty discrimination

Stereotactic surgery: Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3–4% for induction; 1–1.5% for maintenance) and immobilized in a stereotactic apparatus. Buprenorphine slow release (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) was administered pre-surgery. Meloxicam (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) was administered once during surgery and once daily for 3 days post-surgery. Eyes were protected with vet ophthalmic ointment (Puralube). The scalp was cleansed and disinfected with a two-stage scrub of betadine and 70% ethanol. Lidocaine solution (0.5%) was injected inside the skin above the head and the scalp was surgically cut to expose skull. Using a dental drill, a small hole was made in the skull above the visual cortex (relative to Bregma: AP −3.2 and ML±2.50, in mm), and a syringe (NanoFil 10 μL syringe, World Precision Instruments) with 33-gauge beveled Nanofil needle (NF33BV-2, World Precision Instruments) was lowered to −0.5 DV where 300 ηl of AAV virus was infused with a flow rate of 40 ηl per minute into either right or left V1 as indicated below. A microsyringe pump (UMP3, World Precision Instruments) and its controller (Micro4, World Precision Instruments) were used to control the speed of the injection. The needle was withdrawn following a 10-min post-injection period, and mice were allowed to recover for four days.

AAV virus: CH neurons were virally labeled by first injecting 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing Cre recombinase (AAVrg-pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre, 1.1 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #51507-AAVrg)) in either right or left V1. Next, in cohort 1 mice were injected with 300 ηl of Cre-dependent AAV expressing EYFP (AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP, 3.2 × 1012 virus molecules/ml (UNC vector core)) in the contralateral V1. In cohort 2, mice were injected with 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing TdTomato (AAV-CAG-hChR2-H134R-TdTomato, 7.6 × 1012 GC/ml (Addgene, #28017-AAVrg)) in one side of V1 &amp; simultaneously AAVrg expressing GFP in the contralateral V1 (AAV-Syn-ChR2(H134R)-GFP, 1.4 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #58880-AAVrg)).

Behavioral procedure: Four weeks after the viral injection, mice were subjected to either only a novel context or novelty discrimination behavior (as detailed above). Control mice (non-exposed, naïve) remained in the home cage. All mice were then put back in their home cages. Ninety minutes after the behavioral procedures, mice were transcardially perfused with 40 ml of ice-cold 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 40 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat#15714-S) in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4 % PFA overnight at 4oC and transferred to PBS before sectioning.

Immunostaining, imaging, and quantification: Brains were mounted on a vibratome stage (Leica VT1000S) using cyanoacrylate glue and sliced into 40 μm sections. EYFP reporter signal was visualized and was not further amplified with antibodies. Two to six slices per mouse were washed with PBS and blocked using 5% normal donkey serum prepared in PBS containing 0.4 % Triton X-100 (PBST) for 2 h at room temperature. Blocking buffer was aspirated out, and the slices were incubated on a shaker with the Anti-cFos (1:500, Millipore Sigma, #ABE457) antibody (prepared in fresh blocking buffer) overnight at 4°C. Slices were then washed three times (10 min each) with the blocking buffer and subsequently incubated with the Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 647, 1:1000; Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature. Following three washes (15 min each) with blocking buffer containing hoechst3342 (to stain cell nuclei; Thermo Fisher Scientific, #H3570) and one final wash with PBS (10 min), slices were mounted with Fluoromount-G Slide Mounting Medium (Electron microscopic Sciences, #17984–25). Z-stack Images of the entire slice thickness of 40 μm with 1 μm step were acquired using an LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Zen acquisition program) with 40x objective at identical settings for all conditions. The resolution of the images was 4.817 pixels per μm. Co-labeling of EYFP, GFP or TdTomato with c-Fos was evaluated by detecting EYFP, GFP or TdTomato and c-Fos double-positive cells using the inbuilt spot function in 3dimensional space in Imarisx64 (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). Representative images shown were captured as snapshots in 3D viewer in Imaris.

Dendritic spines in cross-hemispheric neurons

Stereotactic surgery and CH neuronal labeling: The surgical procedures and stereotactic coordinates were as described above. Dendritic spines of CH neurons were virally labelled by injecting 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing TdTomato (AAV-CAG-hChR2-H134R-TdTomato, 7.6 × 1012 GC/ml (Addgene, #28017-AAVrg)) in one side of V1 &amp; simultaneously AAVrg expressing GFP in the contralateral V1 (AAV-Syn-ChR2(H134R)-GFP, 1.4 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #58880-AAVrg)). At the conclusion of the experiment, all mice were transcardially perfused, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. Brains were removed and post-fixed in 4 % PFA overnight at 4°C. Brains were mounted on a vibratome stage and sliced into 40 μm sections.

Imaging and quantification: GFP and TdTomato reporter signals were visualized and were not further amplified with antibodies. Six to ten coronal sections per mouse from the indicated number of animals were used. Images with z-stacks of the entire slice thickness of 40 μm with 0.5 μm step were acquired using either a LSM 710 or LSM 880 confocal microscopes (Zeiss, Zen acquisition program) with 40x objective at identical settings for all conditions. Experimenter blind to the treatment condition chose layer 5 and layer 2/3 dendritic segments and manually created a surface using an inbuilt surface function in Imarisx64 9.3. We set an arbitrary threshold of 13 – 20 μm dendritic length to include in the analyses. We counted the number of spines in each dendritic segment and divided it by the total length of that dendritic segment to obtain spine numbers per μm.

Rabies virus mediated monosynaptic tracing

Cross-hemispheric tracing: We performed stereotactic procedure as described above and injected 400 ηl of a mixture (200 ηl each) of AAV-syn-FLEX-splitTVA-EGFP-tTA and AAV-TREtight-mTagBFP2-B19G (Addgene, # 00798-AAV1 and #100799-AAV1) (Liu et al., 2017) into either right V1 or left V1 in CaMKIIa-Cre (10-month-old) and PV-Cre mice (4-month-old). After allowing two weeks for viral expression, we injected 200 ηl of recombinant rabies virus (RVΔG-4mCherry(EnvA)) (Weible et al., 2010) into the same V1. After a period of 7 days had elapsed mice were sacrificed, perfused and their brains were removed.

Ipsilateral input to CH neurons: We first expressed Cre recombinase in CH neurons by first injecting 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing Cre recombinase (AAVrg-pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre, 1.1 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #51507-AAVrg) in C57BL6/J mice. After two weeks, we injected 400 ηl of a mixture (200 ηl each) of AAV-syn-FLEX-splitTVA-EGFP-tTA and AAV-TREtight-mTagBFP2-B19G into the contralateral side. After allowing two weeks for AAV expression, we injected 200 ηl of recombinant rabies virus (RVΔG-4mCherry(EnvA)) into the same V1 as a mixture of AAV-syn-FLEX-splitTVA-EGFP-tTA and AAV-TREtight-mTagBFP2-B19G. We waited for 7 days, before mice were sacrificed, perfused, fixed with 4 % PFA and their brains removed.

Immunohistochemistry: Brains were mounted on a vibratome stage (Leica VT1000S) using superglue and sliced into 40 μm sections. Slices were subsequently washed with PBS and blocked using 5% normal donkey serum prepared in PBS containing 0.4% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 2 h at room temperature. Blocking buffer was aspirated out and the slices were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (prepared in fresh blocking buffer) overnight at 4oC on a shaker. The following antibodies were used: Anti-cFos (1:500, Millipore Sigma, #ABE457), Anti-GAD67 (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich, #MAB5406), Anti-Parvalbumin (1:500, Swant, #GP72), Anti-Neun (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, #266 004), and Anti-GFP (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A11122). Slices were then washed three times (10 min each) with the blocking buffer and then incubated with the Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Following three washes (15 min each) with blocking buffer containing hoechst3358 (to stain cell nuclei) and one final wash with PBS (10 min), slices were mounted with fluoromount-G. The following combination of secondary antibodies was used: Alexa Fluor 488, 594 and 647 (1:1000; Invitrogen). EGFP reporter signals were further amplified with an Anti-GFP antibody. mCherry reporter signal was visualized and was not further amplified with antibody.

Images were acquired using either LSM 710 or LSM 880 confocal microscopes (Zeiss, Zen acquisition program) with 5x, 10x, 20x or 40x objectives at identical settings for all conditions. Images were quantified using Imarisx64 9.3. For each experimental condition, two to six coronal sections per mouse from the indicated number of animals were used. The averaged values from two to four images per mouse were used for quantification. All immunohistochemical analyses were done by an experimenter blinded to the treatment conditions.

Quantification and visualization: To detect the position of CH neurons along the vertical length (cortical layers) of the visual cortex, we first used the inbuilt spot function in 3dimensional space in Imarisx64 9.3 to mark cells’ location. We next obtained X &amp; Y position from Imarisx64, and plotted using histfit function with kernel distribution (nonparametric representation of the probability density function) in MATLAB. We used up to 300μm, 300–450 μm, 450–750 μm and 750 μm- corpus callosum from the cortical surface as cortical depths tofor layers2/3, layer4, layer5 and layer6, respectively. Representative images shown were captured as snapshots in 3D viewer in Imaris, or single z-plane images or maximum intensity projections in ImageJ (NIH).

AT8 tau &amp; Congo-red staining in Tau P301S mice

Tau P301S mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and post-fixed in PFA overnight. Brains were mounted on a vibratome stage using superglue and sliced into 40 μm sections. Slices were subsequently washed with PBS and blocked using 5% normal donkey serum prepared in PBS containing 0.4% PBST for 2 h at room temperature. The blocking buffer was aspirated out and the slices were incubated with the Ser202/Thr205 primary antibody (prepared in fresh blocking buffer) overnight at 4oC on a shaker. Slices were then washed three times (10 min each) with the blocking buffer and then incubated with the Alexa Fluor-647 secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Following three washes (15 min each) with blocking buffer containing hoechst3348 and one final wash with PBS (10 min), slices were mounted with fluoromount-G. For Congo-red staining, slices were incubated with 0.1% Congo-red (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#C6277–25G. prepared in PBS and filtered through 40 μm filter) for 10min at room temperature. Next, the slices were washed three times (15 min each) with PBST containing hoechst3348. After one final wash with PBS (10 min), slices were mounted with fluoromount-G.

Images were acquired using LSM 710 confocal microscope with 40x objectives at identical settings for all conditions. Images were quantified using Imarisx64 9.7. For Ser202/Thr205 staining, we used 2 slices/mouse and the averaged values from two images per mouse were used for quantification. We observed good signals across slices and mice. We set an arbitrary threshold based on the immunosignal to consider whether a neuron is Ser202/Thr205 positive. For Cong-red staining, we used 1 slice/mouse and 4 images per slice.

Chemogenetic inhibition or activation of CH neurons during novelty discrimination

Stereotactic surgery: The surgical procedures and stereotactic coordinates were as described above. Briefly, mice was anaesthetized with isoflurane. A small hole was made in the skull above the visual cortex (relative to Bregma: AP −3.2 and ML±2.50, in mm), and a syringe (NanoFil 10 μl syringe, World Precision Instruments) with 33-gauge beveled Nanofil needle (World Precision Instruments, #NF33BV-2) was lowered to −0.5 DV where 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing Cre recombinase (AAVrg-pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre, 1.1 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #51507-AAVrg)) in either right or left V1 was infused with a flow rate of 40 ηl per minute. A microsyringe pump (UMP3, World Precision Instruments) and its controller (Micro4, World Precision Instruments) were used to control the speed of the injection. The needle was withdrawn following a 10 min post-injection period, and mice were allowed for 2 weeks to express Cre recombinase in the CH neurons. For inhibition, after 2 weeks, 300 ηl Cre-dependent AAV expressing hM4D(Gi) (AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry, 2.5 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene #44362-AAV8)) was injected into the contralateral V1. For activation, after 2 weeks, 300 ηl Cre-dependent AAV expressing hM3Dq (AAV.CMKIIa-hM3D(Gq), 2.8X1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #50476) was injected into the contralateral V1. Control mice received a similar surgical and viral infusion procedures but did express only Cre in CH neurons.

Novelty discrimination: All mice (control mice, mice with hM4D(Gi) or hM3D(Gq) in right or left V1 in CH neurons) were injected with CNO (Clozapine-N-Oxide, 3 mg/k.g.) 20 minutes prior to the test. Mice underwent visual novelty acquisition for 10 minutes and 20 minutes later underwent novelty discrimination testing as described in the Novelty discrimination behavior section. Novelty index was calculated as described in the Novelty discrimination behavior section.

Optogenetic inhibition of CH neurons during novelty discrimination

Stereotactic surgery: The surgical procedures and stereotactic coordinates were as described above. Briefly, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane. A small hole was made in the skull above the visual cortex (relative to Bregma: AP −3.2 and ML±2.50, in mm), and a syringe (NanoFil 10 μl syringe, World Precision Instruments) with 33-gauge beveled Nanofil needle (World Precision Instruments, #NF33BV-2) was lowered to −0.5 DV where 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing Cre recombinase (AAVrg-pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre, 1.1 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene, #51507-AAVrg)) in either right or left V1 was infused with a flow rate of 40 ηl per minute. A microsyringe pump (UMP3, World Precision Instruments) and its controller (Micro4, World Precision Instruments) were used to control the speed of the injection. The needle was withdrawn following a 10 min post-injection wait period, and mice were given 2 weeks for expression of Cre recombinase in the CH neurons. After 2 weeks, 300 ηl Cre-dependent AAV expressing inhibitory halo-rhodopsin eNPHR3.0 (pAAV-Ef1a-DIO eNpHR 3.0-EYFP (Addgene, #26966-AAV5) was injected into the contralateral V1. Control mice received a similar surgical and viral infusion procedures but did express only Cre in the CH neurons. Immediately after the virus injections, fiber optic cannula (Thorlabs, #CFMLC52L02) were implanted in the contralateral V1. Skull screw and dental cement (Parkell, C&amp;B Metabond Quick Adhesive Cement System, # SKU:S380) was used to secure the optic fibers.

Novelty discrimination: Three weeks after the viral infusion and fiber optic cannula implantation mice were connected to a tethering wire to acclimatize the optogenetic perturbation during the novelty discrimination behavior. All mice (control mice, mice with eNPHR3.0 in right or left V1 in CH neurons) were presented with 532 ηm light (continuous, 10 mW at the tip of the fiber) during the acquisition. We used 532 ηm laser (OEM Laser Systems, #SKU: GR-532–00200-CWM-SD-03-LED-0) and ferrule patch cable (Thorlabs, #M83L01, Ø200 μm Core, 0.39 NA) to deliver 532 ηm light. Light was regulated through pulser (Prizmatix, version 3.2). 20 minutes later mice underwent novelty discrimination testing as described above.

Ex vivo slice electrophysiology

Virus injections for patch-clamp recording of PV interneurons or pyramidal neurons upon stimulating CH neurons in the contralateral V1: The surgical procedures and stereotactic coordinates were as described above. PV-Cre mice were injected with a mixture of 500 ηl (250 ηl each) of AAV.EF1a.DIO.mCherry (generated in house, 8.30 × 1012 vg/ml) and AAV-Syn-ChR2(H134R)-GFP (Addgene, #58880-AAVrg, 1.4 × 1013 GC/ml).

Virus injections for patch-clamp recording of CH neurons upon stimulating PV interneurons in the ipsilateral V1: The surgical procedures and stereotactic coordinates were as described above. PV-Cre mice were injected with 300 ηl of AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP (3.2 × 1012 virus molecules/ml, UNC vector core) in one V1 side, and 300 ηl of AAVrg-CAG-tdTomato (codon diversified; Addgene, #59462-AAVrg) was injected in the contralateral V1.

Visual cortical slice preparation and data acquisition: Two to three weeks after the virus injections, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. Acute coronal visual cortical slices (250 μm thick) were prepared in ice-cold NMDG cutting solution (in mM: 2.5 KCL, 1.25 NaH2PO4.H2O, 20 HEPES, 2 Thiourea, 5 Na-ascorbate,3 Na-Pyruvate, 92 NMDG, 30 NaHCO3, 25 D-Glucose, 0.5 CaCl2.2H20, 10 MgSO4.7H2O) using a Leica VT1000S vibratome (Leica). Slices were recovered with NMDG cutting solution for 20 min at 32°C. The cutting and recording solutions were saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and maintained at a pH of 7.4 for 1–6 h. Individual slices for recording were then transferred to a submerged recording chamber and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; consisting of (in mM) 124 NaCl, 3.3 KCl, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.5 MgCl2, 26 NaHCO3 and 11 glucose) at a constant rate of 2–2.5 ml/min at room temperature. Cells were visualized under the microscope (Olympus BX51 WI). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using patch pipettes that pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries. A borosilicate glass electrode (resistance of 6–7MΩ) with pipette solution containing (in mM) 145 CsCl; 5 NaCl; 10 HEPES; 10 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP was used. Recordings were obtained using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Data were low-pass filtered at 2kHz, acquired using DigiData 1440A, and analysed using pClamp10 at 10 kHz sampling frequency.

For recording induced excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), optogenetic stimulation of CH neurons were performed at 5 Hz and 40 Hz light pulse (2 ms pulse duration) in a randomized order. mCherry+ PV interneurons or putative pyramidal neurons in the contralateral side were patched and whole cell voltage clamp recordings were performed. EPSC were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV.

For induced inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) recording, CH neurons were patched and whole cell voltage clamp recordings were performed while optogenetically activating PV interneurons in the ipsilateral side with 5 Hz or 40 Hz light pulses. IPSC were recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV in the presence of 10 μM CNQX and 50 μM AP-5. Recordings were discontinued if series resistance increased by &gt;20 %. In both EPSC and IPSC experiments, an initial test was conducted to adjust light intensity and duration.

Cross-hemispheric synchronization during novelty discrimination behavioral task

Bilateral electrode probes: Bilateral LFP probes were custom-built using a 3D printed base with perfluoroalkoxy coated tungsten wire electrodes (50 μm bare diameter, 101.6 μm coated diameter; A-M Systems, #795500) and a Neuralynx electrode interface board (EIB-36). Polyimide tubes were used to protect electrodes and reduce electrical noise. Electrodes were arranged to target layers 2/3 and 5 of visual cortex. A reference electrode was placed in the cerebellum. We used 7-month-old C57BL6/J mice, 15-month-old 5XFAD, 9.5-month-old Tau P301S and age matched WT littermates.

Probe implantation: The surgical procedures and stereotactic coordinates were as described above. Using a dental drill, a 2 × 2 mm piece of skull was removed, which was above the V1 (stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma; AP −3.2; ML±2.5); during this entire procedure, the dura was kept intact and moist with saline. We did not continue with the probe implantation in those mice in which the dura and/or cortical surface were accidentally damaged. Following the skull removal from above both the right and left V1, we made two additional drilling holes above the frontal cortex and placed two skull screws. Recording probes were then fitted to the stereotactic apparatus and aligned to the craniotomy and slowly lowered to ~50 μm above the cortical target depth. The probe was grounded to skull screw above the cerebellum. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline, 100% white petrolatum) was gently applied on the cranial window without touching the probe/electrodes, which protected both the brain and probe/electrode. Next, we further lowered the probe adjusted to reach the target depth. Finally, probe was cemented on the skull with dental cements, first with a metabond (Parkell, C&amp;B Metabond Quick Adhesive Cement System, # SKU:S380) followed by a dental cement from Steolting (# 51459).

Electrophysiology data acquisition: Mice were connected to the tethered electrophysiology recording device to habituate to the recording set up for 20 min per day for 3 days. During habituation, animals were allowed to move freely in their home cages, which is located next to the novelty discrimination chamber. Following 30 min of baseline recording, mice were introduced into the novelty acquisition chamber. Recording sessions during novelty acquisition were composed of a 10–15 min period in which animals explored the novel patterns on both sides of the chamber walls. 30minutes after the acquisition, mice were re-introduced into the same chamber which now contains a novel visual pattern on one of the walls as described in ‘Novelty discrimination behavior’ section. Data were acquired using Neuralynx SX system (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, USA) and signals were sampled at 32,000 Hz.

Angular velocity: We used angular velocity to measure whether WT and 5XFAD differ in their amount of turning during visual novelty acquisition and electrophysiological recording. Angular velocity is defined as: Angularvelocity(n)=RTAnTn−Tn−1

Where RTAn is the relative turn angle for sample n, and Tn- Tn-1 is the difference between current (n) and previous (n-1) samples. We unassigned the direction of the sign such that we obtained absolute angular velocity for a time bin of 1 sec and averaged across the entire trial duration.

Chemogenetic inhibition of CH neurons and in vivo electrophysiology

To facilitate chemogenetic control of neurons, 300 ηl of retrograde AAV expressing Cre recombinase (AAVrg-pmSyn1-EBFP-Cre (Addgene, #51507-AAVrg)) was injected in either right or left V1, as described previously. After a period of 2 weeks to allow sufficient expression of Cre recombinase in CH neurons, 300 ηl of Cre-dependent AAV expressing hM4D(Gi) (AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry 2.5 × 1013 GC/ml (Addgene #44362-AAV8)) was injected into the contralateral V1. Following an additional two weeks, we implanted bilateral recording probes.

Bilateral electrode probes and implantation: 16 channel linear probes were obtained from Neuronexus (#A1×16–3mm-50–177-CM16LP; 50 μm spacing between electrodes). The surgical and implantation procedures were as described above with some modifications. Briefly, using a dental drill, a 1 × 1 mm piece of skull was removed, which was above the V1 (stereotaxic coordinates relative to bregma; AP −3.2; ML±2.5); during this entire procedure, the dura was kept intact and moist with saline. Following the skull removal from above both the right and left V1, we made two additional drilling above the frontal cortex and placed two skull screws. A single linear probe was then fitted to the stereotactic apparatus and aligned to the craniotomy and slowly lowered to ~50 μm above the cortical target depth in the left V1. Petroleum jelly (Vaseline, 100% white petrolatum) was gently applied on the cranial window without touching the probe, which protected both the brain and probe/electrode. Next, we further lowered the probe to reach the target depth. Subsequently, the probe was cemented on the skull by applying dental cement (Parkell, C&amp;B Metabond Quick Adhesive Cement System, # SKU:S380) entirely on the left side of skull and also covering the frontal skull screw. 10 minutes after the application of dental cement and securing a linear probe in the left V1, we fitted a second linear probe to the stereotactic apparatus and slowly lowered to ~50 μm above the cortical target depth in right V1, petrolatum was gently applied, lowered the probe to the target cortical depth and finally cemented on the skull with dental cement. A reference electrode from each right and left V1 were placed in the same location in the cerebellum. After which petrolatum was applied to cover the drill above the cerebellum to protect the brain and references from dental cement. A final layer of dental cement (Steolting, # 51459) was applied to complete the implantation.

Electrophysiology data acquisition: Following a 2 to 3 day habituation period, recordings commenced with animals allowed to move freely in their home cages. Recording sessions were composed of a 1 h baseline period, immediately followed by a further 3 h recording session after intraperitoneal injection of clozapine-N-oxide injection (3 mg/kg b.w. Tocris, #4936). A custom designed adapter (Neuralynx, 2x HS-16-N2T and 1x dual adapter) was used to connect both 16 channels linear probe headstages to a single 32 channel Digital Lynx SX recording system. Data were acquired using NeuralynxSX system (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, USA) and signals were sampled at 32,000 Hz. At the conclusion of the experiment, mice underwent terminal anesthesia and electrode positions were marked by electrolytic lesioning of brain tissue with 50 mA current for 10 s, passed through an electrode corresponding to the coordinates of layer, to confirm the anatomical location of recording sites.

In vivo electrophysiology data analyses

Data segmentation: The raw LFP and Multiunit activity (MUA) data was inspected for quality control measures and channel selection, and the data was split into segments of interest in Neuraview (Neuralynx). We kept the total data length range comparable between genotypes and treatments. Mice in the home cage tend to not move a lot (as is the case during the baseline recording prior to novelty discrimination test) and we thus recorded for 30 minutes baseline. These parameters allowed to keep the LFP spectral power difference minimal between baseline and novelty discrimination behavior.

Multi-unit spikes and single unit spikes: MUA was extracted by examining waveforms and applying a spike threshold during data acquisition in the Cheetah program (Neuralynx). Single units were manually isolated by drawing cluster boundaries around the 2D projection of the recorded multi-unit spikes, using SpikeSort3D software (Neuralynx). We set a stringent cut off, included units that are clearly separated in 2D projection and further validated the quality of units using spike autocorrelogram. Cells were considered regular spiking pyramidal neurons or fast spiking interneurons based on three metrices such as mean spike duration, peak to trough ratio, and mean spike rate.

Power spectral analyses (PSD): LFPs were first down sampled to 1,000 Hz. Power spectral analyses with 0.5 Hz frequency resolution were performed using the pwelch function in MATLAB using a 500 ms time window with a 50 % overlap. To clarify trends in PSD, plotted results in Figures 5D, 5E were smoothed with Gaussian kernels for plotting purposes only.

Current Source density (CSD): Raw LFP signals were bandpass-filtered at theta (4– 12 Hz) or gamma (30 – 50 Hz). Next, we calculated one-dimensional CSD using the method as described previously (Pettersen et al., 2006).We aimed to identify sink- sources, and did not aim to determine the onset and offset latencies of sinks or sources as this has been described as difficult in previous studies (Happel et al., 2010; Schaefer et al., 2015). Cortical depths were estimated based on the lesioned site (post-recording) of recording.

Phase locking value: Down sampled LFPs were filtered in the theta (4 – 12 Hz) and gamma (30 – 50 Hz) frequency bands, using a window-based finite response bandpass filter. Instantaneous phase (φ) was derived using the Hilbert transform for the right and left V1 filtered signals and signed as φr and φl, respectively. Then the PLV was calculated in each frequency band as described previously (Rosenblum et al., 1996).

Phaselockingvalue= ∣1N∑j=1Nexp (i[ϕr(jΔt)−ϕl(jΔt])∣

where N stands for the length of time series. The difference between φr and φl time courses (Δφ) quantifies locking between the phases of these two LFP signals. PLV values range from 0 and 1; with 0 representing no phase relationship and 1 representing two perfectly in-phase signals. PLV was calculated across several electrodes in each hemisphere and subsequently averaged, with sites corresponding to layer 2/3 and layer 5. To remove any bias due to changes in LFP amplitudes and other factors, the PLV for each of the paired channels was calculated based on randomly shuffled baseline and novelty acquisition durations in WT and 5XFAD mice or equal signal length with or without CNO. This shuffling was repeated 100 times and the averaged PLV shuffle was obtained. Thus, PLVs used in our analysis were shuffle-corrected by subtracting shuffled PLV from the observed PLV.

Cross-correlation analyses: The LFPs were filtered in the theta (4 – 12 Hz) and gamma (30 – 50 Hz) frequency bands, using a window-based finite response bandpass filter. We next obtained the instantaneous amplitudes by computing the Hilbert transform of each LFP signal. The cross-correlation between the amplitudes of the two Hilbert analytical signals was computed, over lags ranging from +0.2 to −0.2 seconds. Finally, we averaged across all electrodes in each group for the cross-correlogram shown in Figures S5A &amp; S5B. Correlation coefficients in Figure 5G reflect the peak of the cross-correlogram from electrodes corresponding to layer 4.

Spike-field coherence (SFC): The isolated spikes as described above were pooled together and analyzed as MUA. The coherence between spikes and LFPs was calculated as described previously (An et al., 2019). Like the phase locking value, a SFC value of zero indicates the absence of phase synchronization between spikes and LFPs, whereas an SFC value of 1 indicates the perfect synchronization between spikes and LFP. To clarify trends in SFC, plotted results in Figure 3C, 3D, 3G, 3H and Figure S3A, S3B were smoothed with Gaussian kernels for plotting purposes only.

Theta-Gamma coupling: Theta-gamma coupling of theta phase and gamma amplitude was performed as previously described (Tort et al., 2009). Briefly, the LFP data were filtered in the theta (4 – 12 Hz) and gamma (30 – 50 Hz) frequency bands. The phase time series for theta [Φftp(t)] and the amplitude envelope time series for gamma [AfgA(t)] were obtained by a Hilbert transformation of the filtered LFPs. We then generated a combined time series [Φftp(t), AfgA(t)]. After phase binning, the means AfgA(j) of AfgA for each bin j were calculated and normalized using the sum over n bins, to generate the phase-amplitude distribution P(j). The modulation index is based on calculating the Kullback-Leibler distance (DKL) between the non-uniform phase-amplitude distribution P(j) over all phase bins and the uniform (i.e. uncoupled) distribution U(j). The modulation index is defined as: Modulationindex=DKL(P(j),U(j))Log N

Single unit - LFP phase locking: The relationship between neuronal spike times and LFP phase was calculated as previously described using the Circular Statistics Toolbox (Berens, 2009; Middleton and McHugh, 2016). Briefly, spikes were sorted and LFP traces were filtered using the continuous wavelet transform, returning the instantaneous signal phase and amplitudes. Spike times were linearly interpolated to determine phase, with peaks and troughs of gamma defined as 0 and ±pi radians, respectively. The resulting phase values were binned to generate firing probabilities. Cells were considered to be phase-locked only if they had a distribution significantly different from uniform (p &lt; 0.05 circular Rayleigh test), with the strength of phase locking calculated as the mean resultant length. For spike-phase plot shown in Figure 5I, we kept the bin numbers constant between control (blue) and inhibition (orange) for plotting purposes, but the bin size was chosen automatically by MATLAB based on the phase distribution probability.

Time and frequency-resolved LFP power and cross-spectrum: The LFP data were down sampled to 1,000 Hz. For the calculation of the wavelet power spectrum, the continuous wavelet transforms (CWT) was applied to the LFP using complex Morlet wavelets returning amplitudes at 226 intervals between 1–100 Hz. For the calculation of the wavelet cross-spectrum phase estimates between right and left V1, we utilized Morlet wavelet cross-spectrum (wcoherence function) from the MATLAB wavelet toolbox. All in vivo electrophysiological analyses were conducted in MATLAB (Mathworks, #R2019a) utilizing signal processing, image processing and other tool boxes.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Statistics were performed in Graphpad Prism (version 8.3.1 and 9.3.1) or MATLAB (R2019a). Statistical significance was calculated as noted in the appropriate figure legends and text. Briefly, to test whether the means of paired observations were significantly different, we used a paired t-test. To test whether mean values differed significantly between the two groups, we used independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U based on the distribution of observations. For dendritic spine quantification, in which we included 100s of spines from each animal, we used Nested repeated measures ANOVA to negate artificial elevation of observations. Two-way ANOVAs were used when two or more variables were compared. All tests were corrected for multiple comparisons between right and left V1 and/or frequencies using a procedure that controls the false discovery rate under arbitrary dependence assumptions (i.e., two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli). Statistical significance was set at 0.05.
