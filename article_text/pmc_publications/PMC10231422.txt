Objective:

To study pareidolias, or perceived meaningful objects in a meaningless stimulus, in patients across the Lewy body (LB) disease spectrum, where most do not report hallucinations or delusions.

Methods:

We studied illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in 300 participants [38 cognitively-impaired LB, 65 cognitively-unimpaired LB, 51 Alzheimer’s disease-spectrum (AD-s), 146 Controls]. Pairwise between-group comparisons examined how diagnosis impacts the number of illusory responses. Ordinal regression analysis compared the number of illusory responses across diagnosis groups, adjusting for age, sex, and education. Analyses were repeated after removing participants with reported hallucinations or delusions.

Results:

Cognitively-impaired LB participants were 12.3, 4.9, and 4.6 times more likely than Control, cognitively-unimpaired LB, and AD-s participants, respectively, to endorse illusory responses. After adjusting for age, sex and education, the probability of endorsing one or more illusory response was 61% in the cognitively-impaired LB group, compared to 26% in AD-s, 25% in cognitively-unimpaired LB, and 12% in Control participants. All results were similar after repeated analysis only in participants without hallucinations or delusions. In LB without hallucinations or delusions, 52% with mild cognitive impairment and 66.7% with dementia endorsed at least one illusory response.

Interpretation:

We found illusory responses are common in cognitively impaired LB patients, including those without any reported psychosis. Our data suggest that, prior to the onset of hallucinations and delusions, the Noise Pareidolia Task can easily be used to screen for unobtrusive pareidolias in all LB patients.


pmcIntroduction

Symptoms of psychosis are common in demented patients across the Lewy body (LB) disease-spectrum, such as those with Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated dementia and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)1, and has a high impact on caregiver burden2, nursing home placement3, 4 and patient mortality5. Symptoms of psychosis can also occur in non-demented patients across the LB disease-spectrum and are associated with progression of cognitive impairment with impending dementia4, 6–8. Visual hallucinations and visual illusions are the most commonly encountered psychosis phenomena in LB diseases, although delusions are also frequent9. Collectively, the continuum of progressing symptoms from minor hallucinations, which include illusions, passage hallucinations, and presence hallucinations, to fully formed visual hallucinations are referred to as ‘PD psychosis’9.

Pareidolias are a specific class of illusion defined by complex visual illusions involving ambiguous forms that are perceived as meaningful objects such as faces or animals10. The Noise Pareidolia Task was developed to be a potential surrogate indicator and objective measure of visual hallucinations in patients with psychosis associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task are defined as false endorsement of objects or faces at locations where the object or face does not actually exist. Illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task are associated with visual hallucinations in patients with DLB11 and are more commonly seen in patients with DLB compared to patients with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease10. However, there have not been studies assessing the Noise Pareidolia Task in patients across the LB disease-spectrum, such as patients with PD with and without cognitive impairment. Specifically, it is unknown if patients with LB disease, but without PD psychosis, exhibit illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task. If patients who have not yet developed conspicuous or observable PD psychosis report illusory phenomenon on the Noise Pareidolia Task, then this test may be used to predict future psychosis risk in LB disease patients. Indeed, an easy to administer, bedside screening test would have significant impact on monitoring patients at risk for PD psychosis in clinic and even screening patients in clinical trials aimed at psychosis symptom prevention.

In this study, we examined illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in participants across the LB disease-spectrum with and without cognitive impairment from two studies, the Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Pacific Udall Center. We hypothesized that participants in the cognitively impaired LB disease group will have increased illusory responses compared to the other groups. We then determined whether illusory responses occur in LB disease participants without reported hallucinations or delusions.

Methods

Participants

We studied 322 participants from the Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and Pacific Udall Center12 who completed the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Noise Pareidolia Task from the Lewy Body Disease Module13 as part of their annual neuropsychological evaluation. In addition to a clinical evaluation that included clinical history, physical examination, neuropsychological assessments, and general neurological examination, each participant underwent detailed motor testing (Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, Part III14). A comprehensive annual cognitive evaluation included the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set15 and was supplemented by additional tests, for at least two tests in five cognitive domains12, 16, including: Judgement of Line Orientation17, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised18, Selective Reminding Cued Recall Test19, Letter-Number Sequencing20, Clock Drawing Test21, Victoria Stroop Test22, Cookie Theft Picture narrative writing task23, and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading24. The Clinical Dementia Rating25 was also administered as a global measure of function.

Presence of hallucinations and delusions were determined by participant report using the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [question 1.2, 0 (no) or ≥1 (yes)] or by study partner report using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire26 [questions 2 and 3 (yes/no)] for the Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and the full Neuropsychiatric Inventory [questions A and B (yes/no)] for the Pacific Udall Center. Participants were categorized as not experiencing observable/known hallucinations or delusions if “0” or “No” was reported for all of these questions. Depression symptoms were assessed using the 15 item Geriatric Depression Scale27. The levodopa equivalency dose was calculated according to published criteria28.

All participants underwent diagnostic adjudication at a multi-disciplinary consensus meeting, which included at least two neurologists, a clinical neuropsychologist, and other research staff. PD was diagnosed using the UK Brain Bank criteria and required bradykinesia with muscle rigidity and/or rest tremor29. Participants with PD were further categorized as having LB disease with no cognitive impairment (LB-nlCog) if there was no cognitive complaint and no objective impairment on cognitive testing. Participants were categorized as having LB disease with cognitive impairment (LB-abnlCog) if they had 1) PD with mild cognitive impairment, defined as a cognitive complaint and objective impairment on cognitive testing, using MDS Level-II criteria12, 16, without substantial impact on functional activities, 2) PD with dementia, defined as cognitive impairment severe enough to interfere with activities of daily living7, as determined by clinical history and the Clinical Dementia Rating, or 3) DLB, defined according to published criteria6. Alzheimer’s disease-spectrum (AD-s) group included patients with dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment likely attributed to Alzheimer’s disease pathology based on the NIH Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostic Guidelines30, 31. Healthy controls (HC) were older adults without parkinsonism or other neurological examination abnormalities referable to the central nervous system and not meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia.

Inclusion criteria were (1) categorization as LB-nlCog, LB-abnlCog, AD-s, or HC at consensus meeting and (2) no history of other central nervous system disease. Exclusion criteria were (1) participants with cognitive impairments that do not met the above criteria for LB-abnlCog or AD-s, (2) otherwise normal individuals with autosomal dominant gene mutations for Alzheimer’s disease, (3) large vessel strokes by history or MRI that would impair vision or cognition, (4) inability to perform cognitive testing due to self-reported visual impairment, (5) acute psychiatric illness or untreated severe mood/thought related-disorder.

Twenty-two participants were excluded (Figure 1): 8 with likely mixed LB disease and Alzheimer’s disease pathology underlying cognitive impairment, two with posterior cortical atrophy diagnoses, one because of primarily vascular etiology underlying cognitive impairment, one HC with a Presenilin-1 mutation, and 10 participants because of unclear etiology underlying non-amnestic cognitive impairments. The criteria for mild cognitive impairment likely attributed to Lewy body disease pathology was not yet published at the time of data collection32; therefore, these criteria were not applied to the 10 non-amnestic cognitively impaired participants during consensus meeting. Our final cohort included 300 participants: 65 LB-nlCog, 38 LB-abnlCog, 51 AD-s, and 146 HC. The Stanford Institutional Review Board approved this study and all study participants provided written informed consent.

Noise Pareidolia Task

The Noise Pareidolia Task we administered in this study was the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Noise Pareidolia Task-Short Form from the Lewy Body Disease Module33. The task consists of 20 black and white noise stimuli images; 13 contain only the noise stimuli (Noise Image, Figure 2A) and 7 contain noise stimuli with one human face embedded (Face Image, Figure 2B). Participants viewed each image for up to 30 seconds and were asked if they see a human face. Participants who answered “yes” were instructed to point to where they saw the face image. An illusory response was when a participant saw a face in the Noise Image (where there is no face). Participants could endorse a maximum of 13 illusory responses, one for each Noise Image. Before the Noise Pareidolia Task was administered, a detailed explanation and three practice images were administered where participants were provided with cues to indicate whether they answered the practice images correctly and were given appropriate feedback as needed. During the Task, no additional feedback was given to participants, regardless of whether the responses were correct or incorrect.

Statistical Analysis

The continuous variables in different diagnosis groups (HC, LB-nlCog, LB-abnlCog, AD-s) were summarized by their mean and standard deviation. Similarly, categorical variables were summarized by counts and proportions. To examine the differences in clinical and demographic characteristics between groups, we used a one-way Analysis of Variance for continuous variables or a chi-square test for categorical variables. We used the Proportional odds regression model to compare the number of illusory responses during the Noise Pareidolia Task (0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥4) across different diagnosis groups after adjusting for potential imbalances in age, sex and education. The pair-wise between-group difference was summarized by odds ratio of having more illusory response and associated 95% confidence interval. We also estimated the frequency of illusory responses in different diagnosis groups adjusting for age, sex and education based on the fitted ordinal regression for a direct comparison. We then repeated the same analysis, but only included the participants without reported hallucinations/delusions, as defined above. The Bonferroni adjustment was used to control the family wise type I error; since there were 6 pairwise comparisons (between 4 diagnosis groups), a significance level of 0.05/6 = 0.0083 was used for individual comparison.

In an exploratory analysis, we performed multiple linear, logistic, and ordinal regression analyses to examine the association between the presence/absence of illusory responses and performance on tests from the cognitive evaluation (dependent outcome), adjusting for age, sex and education. We then repeated the analyses by additionally adjusting for Montreal Cognitive Assessment total score to determine the relationship between illusory responses and specific cognitive tests after adjusting for the severity of global cognitive impairment. As analyses with cognitive performance were a priori determined to be exploratory we did not adjust for multiple comparisons and a significance level of 0.05 was used. All statistical analyses were conducted using R 3.6.0 (The R foundation for Statistical Computing).

Results

Participant Characteristics

See Table 1 for diagnosis group demographic characteristics. The one-way Analysis of Variance revealed significant differences between groups in age (p&lt;0.001), sex (p=0.002), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (p&lt;0.001). The HC group was older than the LB-abnlCog group, and the AD-s group was older than the HC, LB-nlCog, and LB-abnlCog groups; however, the LB-abnlCog and LB-nlCog groups were not significantly different in age. In addition, there were no significant differences between the LB-nlCog and LB-abnlCog groups in levodopa equivalency dose or disease duration.

Between-Group Comparisons of Illusory Responses

Results from the pairwise between-group comparisons that examined the number of illusory responses can be found in Table 2. First, we included all participants, those with and without hallucinations or delusions. After we corrected for multiple comparisons, we found the LB-abnlCog group was significantly associated with an increased number of illusory responses compared to the HC, AD-s, and LB-nlCog groups. Specifically, the odds of endorsing more illusory responses in LB-abnlCog group was more than 10 times more likely than HC (OR 12.26, 95%CI 5.23, 28.74) and about 4–5 times more likely than the AD-s group (OR 4.59, 95%CI 1.77, 11.93) and the LB-nlCog group (OR 4.87, 95%CI 2.08, 11.38).

We next excluded all participants with reported hallucinations or delusions (Table 2 and Table 3). Similar to the first analysis, after we corrected for multiple comparisons, the LB-abnlCog group was still significantly associated with an increased number of illusory responses compared to the HC, AD-s, and LB-nlCog groups. Here, the odds of endorsing more illusory responses in the LB-abnlCog compared to HC (OR 11.35, 95%CI 4.58, 28.13), AD-s (OR 4.43, 95%CI 1.60, 12.29) and LB-nlCog (OR 4.56, 95%CI 1.80, 11.52) groups was similar to the results with all participants included.

Because the LB-abnlCog group included three patient subtypes across the LB disease-spectrum, we confirmed the illusory responses were not exclusive to one subgroup. We found that 50% (14/28) of PD with mild cognitive impairment, 66.7% (2/3) of PD with dementia, and 85.7% (6/7) of DLB had at least one illusory response. In the non-hallucinating LB-abnlCog group, 52% (13/25) PD with mild cognitive impairment, 66.7% (2/3) of PD with dementia, and 66.7% (2/3) of DLB had at least one illusory response.

In the subset of participants with reported hallucinations or delusions, seven had dementia (5 LB-abnlCog and 2 AD-s). Of these seven, six endorsed at least one illusory response on the Noise Pareidolia Task (one AD-s participant with dementia did not endorse illusory responses).

Adjusted Probabilities of Illusory Responses

To account for between-group demographic differences, we then estimated the distribution for the number of illusory responses during the Noise Pareidolia Task across different diagnosis groups after adjusting for age, sex, and education. The probability of endorsing one or more illusory responses in the LB-abnlCog group was 61% in the full group of participants (Figure 3A). In contrast, the other three groups were less likely to endorse illusory responses with 12% in HC, 26% in AD-s, and 25% in LB-nlCog.

The adjusted probabilities remained consistent even after we excluded participants with reported hallucinations or delusions, with the probability of endorsing one or more illusory responses 59% in the LB-abnlCog group, and the likelihood of endorsement of at least one illusory response unchanged in the HC, AD-s, and LB-nlCog groups (Figure 3B).

Because of between group differences in depression score, we included the Geriatric Depression Score as a potential confounder in the regression model in an exploratory analysis. This did not substantially change the results and therefore depression is unlikely to influence endorsement of illusory responses.

Finally, we performed an exploratory analysis examining the association between the presence/absence of illusory responses and cognitive performance in participants across the entire LB disease-spectrum. Endorsement of any illusory response was associated with worse performance on MoCA (p=0.0009), Digit Symbol Coding (p=0.003), Semantic Fluency Test (Animals) (p=0.003), Multi-lingual Naming Test (p=0.001), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised Immediate Recall (p=0.02), and Benson Delayed Recall (p=0.00004) after adjustment for age, sex, and education (Table 4). After repeating the analyses and adjusting for MoCA, in addition to adjusting for age, sex, and education, illusory responses remained associated with worse performance on Digit Symbol Coding (p=0.03), Semantic Fluency Test-Animals (p=0.04), Multi-lingual Naming Test (p=0.03), and Benson Delayed Recall (p=0.004). We then repeated the analysis across the AD-s group and found that endorsement of any illusory response was associated with worse performance on Phonemic Fluency (p=0.02) and Benson Immediate Recall (p=0.01) after adjusting for age, sex, and education. The results remained the same after repeating the analyses to additionally adjusting for MoCA.

Discussion

In this study, we examined illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in patients across the LB disease-spectrum with and without cognitive impairment. Our study is the first to explicitly demonstrate increased illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in non-hallucinating LB disease patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, compared to those who are cognitively normal. Indeed, 52% of non-hallucinating LB disease patients with only mild cognitive impairment endorsed at least one illusory response. Importantly, our LB disease groups were matched for levodopa equivalency dose, which could enhance or even cause illusory responses. Together, our findings suggest early, unobtrusive pareidolias could develop in patients across the LB disease-spectrum in conjunction with cognitive decline. Simple, fast, bedside tests of pareidolia responses, such as the Noise Pareidolia Task, could be practically used in clinic to screen patients at risk for PD psychosis or in clinical trials aimed at early detection and interventions to prevent PD psychosis.

PD psychosis is often associated with the onset of dementia in LB diseases4, 6–8, 34; in this study we found fewer illusory responses in the cognitively normal LB disease participants without PD psychosis, compared to those with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The smaller proportion of illusory responses in the cognitively normal LB disease participants indicates that unobtrusive pareidolias may arise in conjunction with cognitive impairment, as is seen with other neuropsychiatric symptoms35. Thus, it is likely that the prevalence of illusory phenomenon may increase over the course of cognitive impairment. While the pathophysiology is not yet fully understood, current literature suggests that the underlying process responsible for the development of hallucinations is interconnected with mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in LB patients36–40. For instance, previous studies have shown the progression of cognitive decline was more rapid in patients with PD with hallucinations than in those without hallucinations38. Furthermore, a recent study of REM sleep behavior disorder, a prodrome of LB disease, found that participants with at least one illusory response performed worse on visuospatial, attention/executive, and memory tests41. Authors postulated pareidolias could be used to differentiate development of a parkinsonian motor syndrome diagnostic of PD or a cognitive syndrome diagnostic of DLB in REM sleep behavior disorder patients. Future studies will need to determine whether illusory responses in cognitively normal PD also predict imminent cognitive decline.

Ours is also the first study of the Noise Pareidolia Task to include cognitively normal patients with PD, whose cognitive categorization was adjudicated using the strict protocols employed by Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers. One other study reported that pareidolias occurred in approximately half of the non-hallucinating, non-demented patients with PD, but this study did not distinguish between PD who were cognitively normal and those with mild cognitive impairment42. In our study, a quarter of the cognitively normal PD participants endorsed at least one illusory response, which was similar to the number in the AD-s group and twice as many as the healthy older adults. In these three groups, most participants who endorsed an illusory response only endorsed one, which could represent a false positive. The predictive value of a single illusory response on the imminent onset of hallucinations should be studied.

Clinically, pareidolias are considered ‘minor hallucinations’ heralding an evolving larger problem43. While the preponderance of neuropathology and imaging data suggest differing underlying mechanisms for minor hallucinations versus fully formed visual hallucinations, both appear to be modulated by the cholinergic system. Yokoi et al found treatment with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil reduced both the number of illusory responses and the severity of visual hallucinations in DLB patients33. In our study, significantly more LB participants with cognitive impairment (18%) were taking cholinesterase inhibitors, which may decrease the risk of hallucinations, compared to those without cognitive impairment (3%) and may in fact diminish pareidolias, as well as visual hallucinations, in these participants. Moreover, an increased number of cognitively normal (28%) compared to cognitively impaired (11%) participants were taking anticholinergic medications, which may increase the risk of hallucinations and, consequently, artificially enhance pareidolias in cognitively normal group. However, after excluding participants with psychosis, no significant differences between the two groups remained. Thus, the use of cholinesterase inhibitors or anticholinergic medications were unlikely to bias our results.

Altogether, these data suggest illusory responses and visual hallucinations exist on a continuum of severity, and that endorsement of illusory responses may foreshadow the development of future fully formed hallucinations. Identifying patients at risk of fully formed visual hallucinations is important for several reasons. Anti-parkinsonian medications, such as dopaminergic medications, are critical to treat the primary motor symptoms experienced by patients with PD and DLB44, and typically improve patient quality of life. Certain gait and balance impairments that can lead to falls can be dopamine and amantadine (which has anticholinergic properties) responsive45. However, these same anti-parkinsonian medications are also known to cause or exacerbate hallucinations46, 47. PD psychosis independently increases the risk for nursing home placement3, 4, caregiver distress2, and mortality5, and is the most common reason for hospital admission48. In practice, advanced patients with PD often require higher doses of dopamine or addition of dopamine agonists to prevent wearing off, or the addition of amantadine to treat troublesome dyskinesias. In older patients, those with MCI, and/or those with more than 10 years duration, there is real risk that these treatments for motor symptoms could cause or worsen PD psychosis. In considering the balance between giving a therapy and causing a side effect, physicians often rely on patient self-report to determine if a patient experiences illusory phenomenon, but patients who have dementia might not accurately recall or fully understand the nature of these experiences. Taking a ‘try the medication and let’s see’ approach exposes patients to potentially harmful hallucinations. Withholding medications to avoid that harm can undertreat motor symptoms, and cause indirect harm by increased risk of falls due to more off time. Thus, a brief, quantitative, bedside test that could identify patients at higher risk of hallucinations would greatly inform physician decisions treating troublesome motor symptoms with medications like dopamine, dopamine agonists, and amantadine. Early detection of patients at risk of PD psychosis may also provide an opportunity for therapeutic interventions to minimize the impact of visual hallucinations. Our cross-sectional results suggest that the Noise Pareidolia Task should be studied longitudinally in non-hallucinating patients to determine if positive responses indeed predict a higher likelihood for future visual hallucinations and/or delusions in individual patients.

Prior studies investigating illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task in the LB disease have primarily been in patients with dementia, as a tool to distinguish DLB from Alzheimer’s dementia10, 11, 33. Our data confirm and expand on these prior reports by showing that as a group, LB patients with even mild cognitive impairment and dementia report more illusory responses than AD-s patients. Further, most of our LB participants with cognitive impairment or dementia did not have psychosis, yet almost 60% of cognitively impaired but non-psychotic LB participants endorse at least one illusory response, and over half reported more than one illusory response. Thus, illusory responses on the Noise Pareidolia Task were common in these patients without frank, observable hallucinations. In contrast to those with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, the LB patients without cognitive impairment did not differ from the AD-s patients, suggesting that the Noise Pareidolia Task does not distinguish between LB disease and Alzheimer’s disease until the LB patients developed measurable cognitive impairment.

Our results also suggest there may be an association between visual processing and specific cognitive measures. As visual hallucinations may represent an advanced stage of cognitive disease, we adjusted for severity of cognitive impairment. The remaining associations with illusory responses are consistent with previous findings, including processing speed, language (both visually-based naming and fluency), and visual memory49. Our results lend additional support to the hypotheses that visual hallucinations (even minor illusory phenomenon) may occur due to some combination of visual information processing, attention deficits or disruptions to attention networks, and/or disruptions in the default mode network50–54. To date, there is a lack of clear understanding of the timing and relative importance of these changes, as well how deficits in language may fit with current models. Given this, and that our results are in a relatively small sample and do not hold up to multiple comparisons testing, further exploration into domain-specific relationships between pareidolias and cognitive performance are needed to provide insight into common underlying pathways between psychosis and specific cognitive domains.

Our study has several strengths and methodological considerations. There are three versions of the Pareidolia Test: the object and face versions (noise versions), and the scenery version. The first strength of our study is that we used the face version of the Noise Pareidolia Task from Lewy Body Disease Module of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, which is the abbreviated version of the Noise Pareidolia Task. While the scenery version has higher sensitivity and better ability to discriminate between DLB and Alzheimer’s disease patients, the noise versions are easier to administer and more highly correlated with the severity of hallucinations10. Prior studies in DLB patients report that people account for more than 80% of all the content of visual hallucinations55, 56. Uchiyama et al demonstrated that people and animals account for greater than 80% of illusory responses10, suggesting additional benefits to using the face version of the Noise Pareidolia Task. Second, the Noise Pareidolia Task is being administered across multiple Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers and in the future longitudinal data will be available for a large number of patients, which may elucidate whether and how many illusory responses predict future hallucinations. The first methodological consideration is the limited number of participants taking anticholinergics or cholinesterase inhibitors, which limited our inability to determine the impact of medications that can increase or decrease the risk of pareidolias, respectively. Second, although participants had adequate vision to perform all tests, it is unclear whether variations in vision are related to pareidolias and future studies with in-depth vision assessments are needed. Third, the data examined here is primarily non-Hispanic/Latino White individuals, limiting the generalizability of these findings.

In conclusion, our study is the first to explicitly demonstrate increased illusory responses in non-hallucinating LB disease patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, suggesting the Noise Pareidolia Task can be used as a simple bedside screening test for unobtrusive pareidolias in LB patients, who do not report hallucinations or delusions. Additional longitudinal studies are needed to determine how many illusory responses predict future hallucinations and delusions in LB patients.
