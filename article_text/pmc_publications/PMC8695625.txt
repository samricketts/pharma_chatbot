INTRODUCTION:

Immune dysregulation is implicated in neurodegeneration and altered cytokine levels are seen in people with dementia. However, whether cytokine levels are predictive of cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly, especially in the setting of elevated β-amyloid (Aβ), remains unclear.

METHODS:

We measured nine cytokines in the baseline plasma of 298 longitudinally followed CU elderly and assessed whether these measures were associated with cognitive decline, alone or synergistically with Aβ. We next examined associations between cytokine levels and neuroimaging biomarkers of Aβ/Tau/Neurodegeneration.

RESULTS:

Higher IL-12p70 was associated with slower cognitive decline in the setting of higher Aβ (FDR=0.0023), whereas higher IFN-γ was associated with slower cognitive decline independent of Aβ (FDR=0.013). Higher IL-12p70 was associated with less tau and neurodegeneration in participants with higher Aβ.

DISCUSSION:

Immune dysregulation is implicated in early-stage cognitive decline, and greater IL-12/IFN-γ axis activation may be protective against cognitive decline and early-stage AD progression.

pmc1. BACKGROUND

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) animal models, and neuropathologic studies together support the central role of immune dysregulation in AD and late-life cognitive decline. [1–5]. Nonetheless, when and how the immune system contributes to the decades-long process of human AD pathogenesis remains largely unknown, and whether increased or decreased activities of various immune pathways can predict AD progression is poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is particularly acute in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults, a population in whom timely intervention may delay progression of AD neuropathologic change and extensive, irreversible neurodegeneration [6].

Although CSF markers of neuroinflammation reflect the progression of AD [7–9], CSF sampling requires invasive lumbar puncture, and is difficult to scale and implement in large multi-center clinical trials. On the other hand, blood-based biomarkers are less invasive to measure, and, thus, easier to assess in clinical trials and clinical practice. In previous meta-analyses of case-control studies [7] and prospective cohort studies [10], cytokines and inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and α1-antichymotrypsin (α1-ACT), among others, were shown to be elevated in AD dementia cases and predicted incident all-cause dementia. However, the longitudinal relationships of plasma cytokines with AD biomarkers and future rates of cognitive decline in CU older adults remain poorly understood.

Here, we use high-sensitivity, multiplexed immunoassays to analyze baseline plasma samples from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) [11], a study of cognitive aging and preclinical AD with extensive longitudinal cognitive and biomarker data. Using data from this well-characterized cohort of older adults who were CU at study baseline, we identify cytokines that predict future cognitive decline, alone or synergistically with Aβ, and assess the extent to which cytokine levels may be linked to neuroimaging biomarker measures of fibrillar Aβ, neocortical Tau, and hippocampal Neurodegeneration.

2. METHODS

2.1. Participants

HABS recruited CU older adults (50–90 years old at baseline) from the greater Boston area [11]. HABS inclusion criteria includes Clinical Dementia Rating Scale global score 0, age/education-adjusted Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 27, and normal-range performance on Logical Memory IIa Delayed Recall (LMDR; adjusted for years of education: ≥9 for 16+ years, ≥5 for 8 – 15 years, and ≥3 for 0 – 7 years). Persons with a history of stroke (with persistent neurological deficits) or unstable medical/psychiatric conditions were excluded. HABS protocols and procedures were reviewed by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board, and all participants signed a written informed consent. Our study included all HABS participants who underwent baseline 11C Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) and had at least two time points of neuropsychological testing and a stored baseline plasma sample (n=298).

2.2. Neuropsychological and Clinical Characterization

Annual neuropsychological testing included the MMSE, the Digit Symbol Coding task, LMDR, the Free and Cued Selected Reminding Test (free+total), and category fluency (animals, fruits, and vegetables). The average z-score of these tests was used to calculate the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite 5 (PACC5), a cognitive composite designed to capture cognitive changes in preclinical AD [12].

A total of 9 participants were on immunosuppressants (immunomodulator or systemic steroid). APOE haplotype status (ε2/ε3/ε4) was determined by a targeted Taqman assay for rs7412 and rs429358, and heterozygote or homozygote carriers of ε4 haplotype were grouped as ε4 carriers.

2.3. Plasma cytokine assessment

Baseline (fasting), Year 4 (fasting), and Year 6 (non-fasting) a.m. blood samples were collected into EDTA-BD Vacutainer tubes (BD Franklin Lakes, NJ), and plasma was isolated through centrifugation (2000 rcf × 5 minutes). Aliquoted samples were stored at −80 °C, until the described assays were run in January 2019. We used the V-PLEX Proinflammatory Panel 1 Human Kit (K15049D) to assay the following 10 analytes: IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α. The cytokines were quantified using commercially available Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) multi-plex electrochemiluminescent immunoassays on the QuickPlex SQ 120 platform (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville, MD) at the Genetics and Aging Research Unit in the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We processed all plasma samples with the same freeze-thaw cycle and plated the samples in neat dilution in duplicate. Each assay plate also included multiple dilutions of manufacturer-provided calibrators to adjust for potential technical variations. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 ºC, followed by washing and incubation with detection antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature before capturing electrochemiluminescence signals. The protein concentrations (average concentration of duplicate samples; picograms/milliliter [pg/mL]) were calculated using the manufacturer-provided calibrators. Coefficients of variation (CVs, %) were calculated for each duplicate sample pair, using the following formula: 100*(standard deviation/mean).

We chose to use neat dilution to further increase the detection sensitivity, as our initial assay (including n=85 baseline samples) using 2-fold dilution resulted in many samples with undetectable cytokine levels. Using neat dilution, we were able to detect cytokines at a concentration above lower limit of detection (LLOD) in &gt;95% of samples except for IL-2 (40.3% of samples with undetectable values). We excluded IL-2 from our analyses given its high missingness. We excluded all samples exceeding CV of 25% from our main analyses, similar to a previous study from other investigators using the same MSD platform [13].

We performed follow-up sensitivity analyses using a stricter threshold of CV &lt; 10 % for each analyte, or using all samples available. We also performed sensitivity analyses excluding all samples below the lot-specific lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) value (IL-12p70: 0.14 pg/mL; IFN-γ: 1.34 pg/mL), although this is likely a conservative estimate given that we were able to increase assay sensitivity with the modified protocol. Finally, we repeated our main analyses using the initial 2-fold dilution measures to exclude matrix effect-driven results.

2.4. Neuroimaging

Brain PETs were obtained at the MGH PET facility (ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) at baseline (=Year 1), Year 4, and Year 6 [11, 14]. PiB distribution volume ratio (DVR) from an aggregate bilateral cortical region including frontal, lateral parietal, lateral temporal, and retrosplenial cortices (“FLR” regions), with cerebellar gray matter reference, was calculated to quantify neocortical fibrillar Aβ plaque burden. Brain 18F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-PET became available to HABS mid-study, with the majority of participants having their first FTP-PET at their Year 4 visit (n=121; mean 3.1 years (sd 0.21 years) from study entry). We only used FTP-PET data from Year 4 visit for consistency of statistical modeling. We selected the inferior temporal cortex (ITC) as the primary region of interest (ROI; per FreeSurfer [15] v5.3) as it is a region with early neocortical tau accumulation that correlates with cognitive decline [14], and calculated bilateral mean standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using cerebellar gray reference. Both PiB-PET and FTP-PET data was partial volume corrected (PVC) using the geometric transfer matrix method [16] and each PiB-PET scan was classified as Aβ-positive and Aβ-negative based on a previously described gaussian mixture modeling approach (cutoff DVR= 1.324) [17].

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained at baseline, Year 4, and Year 6 on one of two matched Siemens Tim Trio 3-Tesla scanners with a 12-channel phased-array head coil at the MGH – Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging [11]. T1-weighted, volumetric magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence images were processed using FreeSurfer v6.0 (longitudinal processing pipeline) [15]. FreeSurfer-defined hippocampal volume (with adjustment for intracranial volume) was the primary measure structural MRI measure used.

2.5. Statistics

All statistical analyses were done with R version 3.6 (https://cran.r-project.org/). We report the number of participants in each analysis if it was different from the total number of study participants (n=298) due to missingness. All plasma cytokine measures were log-transformed and standardized prior to analyses, so that β-coefficients can be interpreted as standardized effect sizes.

We performed two stages of analyses to identify cytokines that predict either Aβ-related (i.e., synergistic interaction with Aβ) or Aβ-independent cognitive changes. A false discovery rate (FDR) approach was used within each stage to stage to account for multiple comparisons. FDR&lt;0.025 was used as our statistical significance threshold to account for the two stages in the screening process. Effects were examined using the following linear mixed-effect models, all of which included random intercepts and slopes:

(1) Stage 1: Screen 9 measured cytokines to identify cytokines predicting Aβ-related cognitive changes.

PACC5 (time-varying) ~ β0 + β1×(cytokine)×(baseline Aβ)×(time) + β2×(cytokine)×(time) + β3×(baseline Aβ)×(time) + βx×(age, sex, years of education)×(time) + βy×(main terms of each variable)

Here, we used the (cytokine)×(baseline Aβ)×(time) interaction term to identify cytokines associated with longitudinal cognition in the setting of elevated baseline Aβ.

(2) Stage 2: Screen for cytokines predicting Aβ-independent cognitive changes among cytokines that did not have significant interactive association in Stage 1

PACC5 (time-varying) ~ β0 + β1×(cytokine)×(time) + β2×(baseline Aβ)×(time) + βx×(age, sex, years of education)×(time) + βy×(main terms of each variable)

The cytokines’ association with baseline demographic and genetic characteristics were examined with the following linear model:

(cytokine)~ β0 + β1×(baseline age) + β2×(sex) + β3×(APOE ε4 carrier status)

Cytokine levels were assessed for their association with immunosuppressant use. Change over time in cytokine levels was tested in participants with longitudinal cytokine measures with the following linear mixed-effect model with random intercepts:

Cytokine (time-varying)~ β0 + β1×(time)

Lastly, we examined the Aβ-related or Aβ-independent association of individual cytokine measures with neuroimaging biomarkers of fibrillar Aβ (“A”), neocortical paired helical filament tau (“T”), and neurodegeneration (“N”; hippocampal atrophy), using linear models (for baseline Aβ, Year 4 ITC tau, and baseline HV) and linear mixed-effect models with random intercepts and slopes (for longitudinal HV).

3. RESULTS

We examined 298 participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (Table 1).

3.1. Stage 1: Interactive association of cytokines and Aβ with longitudinal cognitive change

In the first stage, we assessed the association of each cytokine with Aβ-related cognitive decline by examining the interactive association between each of the cytokines and baseline neocortical Aβ with longitudinal cognition (PACC5). Higher IL-4 and IL-12p70 levels interacted with higher Aβ burden to predict less cognitive decline during longitudinal follow-up (both FDR &lt; 0.025; Table 2). In follow-up analyses using previously established cutoffs for high and low Aβ burden, we observed that higher IL-12p70 predicted less cognitive decline among individuals with high Aβ, but had no effect in those with low Aβ burden (Figure 1A; Aβ(+) subgroup (n=68), β=0.054, 95% CI 0.017 to 0.091, p=4.2×10−3; Aβ(−) subgroup (n=163), p=0.64; adjusted for baseline Aβ, age, sex, education, and their time interaction terms).

We note that baseline IL-4 and IL-12p70 were highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.69, p&lt;2.2×10−16, in n=216 who had both cytokines measured with CV&lt;25%). When we considered both cytokines in the same model, the IL-12p70 – Aβ interaction remained associated with longitudinal PACC5 (β=0.066, 95% CI 0.010 to 0.12, p=0.020), while the IL-4 – Aβ interaction did not (p=0.18). Our results suggest that the interactive association of IL-4 and Aβ with cognitive decline was driven by the strong correlation between IL-4 and IL-12p70, rather than through an independent association.

We observed similar main results in sensitivity analyses limited to participants with baseline CV&lt;10% for IL-12p70 (n=148, β=0.084, 95% CI 0.025 to 0.14, p=4.9×10−3) or including all participants (n=293, β=0.085, 95% CI 0.043 to 0.13, p=6.8×10−5). The median baseline concentration of IL-12p70 among our participants was 0.18 pg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 0.25 pg/mL), and when we excluded all samples with concentrations below LLOQ (0.14 pg/mL), we observed a similar main result (n=184, β=0.063, 95% CI 0.003 to 0.124, p=0.039). In 40 participants who had detectable IL-12p70 from both neat and 2-fold dilution, IL-12p70 values were well correlated (r=0.77, p=4.7×10−9), and the main results were similar when the analysis was repeated using 2-fold dilution measures (n=40, β=0.10, 95% CI −0.027 to 0.24, p=0.12).

Baseline IL-12p70 was not associated with age, sex, or APOE ε4 carrier status (all p&gt;0.05, n=231). Immunosuppressant medication use did not affect baseline IL-12p70 level (p=0.85, n=193), and repeat IL-12p70 measures were largely stable over time (p=0.70 for IL-12p70 change over time, in n=264 with ≥2 IL-12p70 measures with CV&lt;25%; Figure 1B).

3.2. Stage 2: Association between cytokines and longitudinal cognitive change independent of Aβ

In the second stage, we examined each of the seven cytokines that did not have significant association in the first stage for their Aβ-independent association with longitudinal PACC5. We observed that higher IFN-γ was associated with slower cognitive decline (FDR&lt;0.025; Table 3), and that this association was independent from baseline Aβ burden (Table 2, Figure 2A). This association remained similar (with overlapping 95% confidence intervals) when using different CV thresholds (CV&lt;10% (n=225): β=0.018, 95% CI −4.1×10−5 to 0.037, p=0.051; no CV threshold (n=298), β=0.025, 95% CI 9.5×10−3 to 0.041, p=1.8×10−3). Median IFN-γ at baseline was 4.46 pg/mL (IQR 3.99 pg/mL). A sensitivity analysis excluding all samples below LLOQ (1.34 pg/mL) showed a similar main result (n=295, β=0.028, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.044, p=1.2×10−3). In 83 participants who had detectable IFN-γ from both neat and 2-fold dilution, IFN-γ values were well correlated (r=0.69, p=5.7×10−13), and the main results were similar when the analysis was repeated using 2-fold dilution measures (n=83, β=0.027, 95% CI −4.9×10−4 to 0.053, p=0.054). Baseline IFN-γ was not associated with age, sex, or APOE ε4 carrier status (all p&gt;0.05, n=284). Immunosuppressant use did not alter IFN-γ level (p=0.28, n=240), and repeat measures of IFN-γ were largely stable over time (p=0.44 for IFN-γ change over time, in n=289 with ≥2 IFN-γ measures with CV&lt;25%; Figure 2B).

Baseline IL12p70 and IFN-γ were associated with each other (n=223 with both cytokines’ CV&lt;25%, Pearson’s r=0.49, p=5.7×10−15). However, IL12p70 and IFN-γ did not have a statistical interaction in their association with longitudinal cognition (p=0.58).

3.3. Association of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ with A/T/N biomarkers

Given the association of IL-12p70 and IFN-γ with cognitive decline, we next asked whether these two cytokine measures were correlated with neuroimaging biomarkers of fibrillar Aβ (“A”; PiB PET), neocortical tau (“T”; FTP PET), and hippocampal neurodegeneration (“N”; bilateral HV). There was no direct association between IL-12p70 levels and Aβ at baseline (n=231, p=0.96; adjusted for APOE ε4 status, age and sex). IL-12p70 and Aβ were interactively associated with lower ITC tau burden in samples from Year 4 (i.e., the plasma sample closest to Tau PET in most participants; β=−0.093, 95% CI −0.16 to −0.021, p=0.013; Figure 3A). The results were similar when we used baseline IL-12p70 and Aβ in the model (n=88, β=−0.077, 95% CI −0.15 to −0.003, p=0.041; also adjusted for the time gap between baseline and Year 4 Tau PET). Baseline IL-12p70 and Aβ were interactively associated with larger baseline HV (Figure 3B; n=228; β=3.4×102, 95% CI 80 to 5.9×103, p=0.010). However, the interactive association of baseline IL-12p70 and Aβ with longitudinal HV did not reach statistical significance (Figure 3D; n=193; β=18, 95% CI −5.6 to 42, p=0.13; adjusted for the same covariates as above, and ICV). The associations of high IL-12p70 with lower ITC tau burden and larger HV in the setting of higher Aβ are consistent with a protective effect of higher IL-12p70 on Aβ-related cognitive changes. IFN-γ levels were not correlated with baseline Aβ (n=284; β=−0.038, 95% CI −0.078 to 1.8×10−3, p=0.061) nor with ITC tau (Year 4 samples: n=96, p=0.43; baseline samples: n=118, p=0.75). Baseline IFN-γ was associated with neither baseline HV (n=281, p=0.30; also adjusted for ICV) nor longitudinal HV (n=237; p=0.14).

4. DISCUSSION

Our results show that higher plasma IL-12p70 is a marker of resilience against downstream pathological events such as neocortical tau accumulation and hippocampal neurodegeneration in the setting of elevated Aβ, while higher baseline plasma IFN-γ is a marker of resilience against cognitive decline that is not necessarily limited to the AD continuum. Further, we observed that IL-12p70, a myeloid cell-secreted cytokine, was a more specific predictor of AD progression than Th1-secreted IFN-γ, which is consistent with previous functional genomic studies supporting a causal role of myeloid cells, but not CD4+ T cells, in AD pathogenesis [18, 19]. Although a recent meta-analysis of case-control studies showed no significant association of IL-12 and IFN-γ with MCI or AD [7], it is not necessarily at odds with our results. Due to compensatory increases in immune mediators in reaction to disease progression, prospective cohort studies can show different direction of association compared to cross-sectional case-control studies. This has been well demonstrated with CSF sTREM2, which is elevated in symptomatic AD compared to controls, but at a given disease stage, higher CSF sTREM2 predicted slower disease progression and lower AD dementia risk [20, 21].

In the innate immune system, IL-12 and IFN-γ function together to form a positive feedback loop that influences macrophage activation state (M1 versus M2 polarization) [22–24]. Our results connecting higher plasma levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ with a better cognitive trajectory may seem counter-intuitive with the notion that classic (M1) activation of brain microglia exacerbates neurodegeneration, while alternative (M2) activation of microglia is neuroprotective and helps clear neuronal debris and β-amyloid. However, increases of cytokines in the periphery do not equate to increases in the brain. In the periphery, IL-12 from monocytes induce release of IFN-γ from Th1 cells, which in turns leads to M1 activation of monocytes, priming a strong defense against infection. In contrast, Th2-cell secreted cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 induce the M2 activation state [25].

Accumulating evidence indicates that the M1/M2 scheme that is primarily derived from in vitro cytokine stimulation experiments does not capture the complexity of human in vivo myeloid cell biology [26, 27], as exemplified by strong correlation between plasma IL-12p70 and Th2/M2-related cytokines (e.g., IL-10, IL-13) in a large-scale human study [28]. In our study, elevated IL-4, a representative Th2 cytokine that induces M2 polarization in vitro [22, 23], also predicted less Aβ-related cognitive decline, although this association was likely driven by the correlation between IL-12p70 and IL-4. On the other hand, TNF-⍺ and IL-1β, which are increased in the classic M1 profile, were not associated with cognitive decline. These results illustrate the importance of measuring a comprehensive panel of cytokines and interpreting the data with a more nuanced pathway-specific framework rather than relying on a simplified pro- or anti-inflammatory classification. While our cytokine data most likely relate to the Th1-macrophage axis in the peripheral innate immune system, ample data, primarily from AD genome wide association studies, implicate a key role for microglial activation in AD pathogenesis [1, 2, 18, 19, 29–31]. AD risk variants in CD33, TREM2, and PLCG2 are all known to modulate microglial and monocyte phagocytic function [32–35].

In our study, positive cognitive trajectory was associated with increased levels of plasma IL-12 and IFN-γ, which would be predicted to prime the innate immune system to fight infection. This is particularly interesting given recent evidence for the antimicrobial protection hypothesis of AD [36], which postulates that Aβ aggregation can be triggered by subacute microbial infection in the brain. Specifically, Aβ is thought to function as an antimicrobial peptide that is seeded by microbes to form toxic oligomers that trap pathogens and protect host cells. Thus, one can speculate that higher levels of plasma IL-12 and IFN-γ leading to greater protection from peripheral infection, may also protect against entry of pathogens into the brain, e.g. in older individuals with reduced blood-brain barrier integrity. This would then reduce the need for the antimicrobial response of Aβ to form toxic oligomers. While we observed no statistically significant association of plasma IL-12p70 or IFN-γ with fibrillar Aβ detected with PiB PET, our results indicate that enhancement of the peripheral myeloid cell IL-12/IFN-γ axis reduced neurodegeneration and tauopathy, which can be induced by toxic Aβ oligomers [37, 38]. Thus, elevated levels of IL-12/IFN-γ in the periphery resulting in enhanced protection against infection could be envisaged to lead to reduced entry of microbial pathogens into the brain, resulting in a reduction in antimicrobial/neurotoxic Aβ oligomers [37] that are not measured by PiB-PET. Future studies to directly assess the relationship of CSF or plasma Aβ oligomers with plasma IL-12 and IFN-γ could help examine this hypothesis.

Our study has several limitations. First, cytokine measurements are dynamic, and can be affected by both biological and technical factors. Reassuringly, age, sex, or immunosuppressant use did not affect IL-12 and IFN-γ levels, and these cytokine concentrations from the same individual remained stable on repeat measures up to several years apart. Nonetheless, we cannot fully exclude the effect of unmeasured confounders. Second, the observed association between IL-12p70 and neuroimaging biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration were cross-sectional, and longitudinal associations could not be assessed yet (ITC tau) or did not reach statistical significance (HV). Thus, we could not make convincing causal inferences. A longer follow-up with more longitudinal scans is required to fully assess the longitudinal relationship of IL-12p70 with tau and neurodegeneration. Third, our study enrolled CU older adults without unstable medical conditions at baseline, and our results might not extend to older adults with active medical illness or clinically significant cognitive impairment. For example, we suspect that our study that enrolled healthy volunteers with low vascular disease burden at baseline was underpowered to capture the long term cognitive effect of IL-6, a cytokine implicated in atherosclerotic vascular disease pathogenesis [39] that showed consistent association with all-cause dementia in other studies [10]. Further, majority of our study participants are college-educated European Americans, and we need further studies to extend our results to other socioeconomic or ethnic groups. Fourth, we analyzed samples without dilution to increase detection sensitivity. Using a neat dilution can lead to matrix effects and subsequent random (e.g., increasing measurement error) or systematic (e.g., overestimating concentrations throughout the plate) errors. However, as the samples were plated independent of their cognitive trajectory or AD biomarkers, it is unlikely for these technical errors to create a forced yet robust association between analytes and cognitive trajectory, and sensitivity analyses using available 2-fold dilution measures showed reassuringly consistent results. Nonetheless, potential matrix effect and measurement errors could have dampened true biological signals, and we may be able to identify additional cytokines associated with late-life cognitive trajectories as more sensitive assays become available. Finally, it should be noted that the effect sizes of IL-12 and IFN-γ in predicting cognitive decline were statistically significant but small, and these cytokines should be considered as ancillary biomarkers rather than stand-alone prognostic indicators.

Despite these limitations, our study demonstrates the potential value of two closely related cytokines measured from plasma in predicting Aβ-related and Aβ-independent longitudinal cognitive changes in CU older adults. Our results suggest that peripheral measures of basal myeloid cell activity could serve as a practical and non-invasive surrogate biomarker in early stages of AD, while further validation and mechanistic studies are required to translate our findings into clinical application.

Blue dashed line: PiB DVR=1.08, IL-12p70 −1 s.d.; blue solid line: PiB DVR=1.08, IL-12p70 +1 s.d.; red dashed line: PiB DVR=1.46, IL-12p70 −1 s.d.; red solid line: PiB DVR=1.46, IL-12p70 +1 s.d.

(B) Spaghetti plot of longitudinal plasma IL-12p70 measures (log-standardized). Plasma IL-12p70 levels from subsequent years were largely stable compared to baseline levels (year 3: r=0.84, year 5: r=0.85).

(A) Predicted PACC5 trajectory according to baseline Αβ (PiB DVR at baseline) and baseline plasma IFN-γ, from a linear mixed model. Modeled value for the mean baseline age (72.0) was plotted. Higher IFN-γ was associated with less decline in PACC5 in both Aβ(+) and Aβ(−) subgroups. Blue dashed line: PiB DVR=1.08, IFN-γ −1 s.d.; blue solid line: PiB DVR=1.08, IFN-γ +1 s.d.; red dashed line: PiB DVR=1.46, IFN-γ −1 s.d.; red solid line: PiB DVR=1.46, IFN-γ +1 s.d.

(B) Spaghetti plot of longitudinal plasma IFN-γ measures (log-standardized). Plasma IFN-γ levels from subsequent years were largely stable compared to the baseline levels (year 3: r=0.51, year 5: r=0.49).

(A) Correlation between plasma IL-12p70 (log-standardized) and IT tau at Year 4 visit (3 years from baseline) in high PiB (PiB DVR&gt;1.324; red solid line) and low PiB (PiB DVR&lt;1.186; blue solid line) subgroups.

(B) Predicted HV trajectory according to baseline Αβ (PiB DVR at baseline) and baseline plasma IL-12p70, from a linear mixed model. Modeled value for the mean baseline age (72.0) and mean ICV was plotted. Although individuals with high PiB, high IL-12p70 had smaller baseline hippocampal volume, the rate of longitudinal change was not significantly different compared to individuals with lower PiB or lower IL-12p70. Blue dashed line: PiB DVR=1.08, IL-12p70 −1 s.d.; blue solid line: PiB DVR=1.08, IL-12p70 +1 s.d.; red dashed line: PiB DVR=1.46, IL-12p70 −1 s.d.; red solid line: PiB DVR=1.46, IL-12p70 +1 s.d.

HV=hippocampal volume; ICV=intracranial volume; PiB DVR= Pittsburgh compound B PET distribution volume ratio from a neocortical composite region of interest (cerebellar gray reference).
