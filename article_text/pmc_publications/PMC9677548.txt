pmcThis case report describes multiple amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA) episodes during treatment with aducanumab, outlines how each episode was managed, and reviews current appropriate use recommendations for ARIA management.

Report of a Case

A high-functioning man presented with slowly progressive short-term memory and word-finding difficulties in 2007 at age 67 years. He had a history of first-degree atrioventricular block, hypertension, and hearing loss. Medications included antihypertensives, memantine, and donepezil.

He enrolled in PRIME, the phase 1b clinical trial for aducanumab, in late 2014 and was randomized to the placebo arm. He initially scored 27 of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination and had a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 (sum of boxes = 1.5). APOE genotype was ε3/ε4. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed subtle hippocampal atrophy. The florbetapir positron emission tomography scan was abnormal, consistent with prodromal Alzheimer disease. He completed 14 placebo infusions without incident.

He entered long-term extension (LTE) in late 2015 and was randomized to titration to 6-mg/kg monthly infusions, the maximum allowed dose for APOE ε4 carriers in early protocol versions. At month 7 of LTE, after four 3-mg/kg doses, he developed asymptomatic, radiographically moderate ARIA-vasogenic edema (ARIA-E [Figure]), prompting dose suspension until resolution at month 10, followed by continued 3-mg/kg dosing. At month 12, he developed asymptomatic mild ARIA-E and dosing continued uninterrupted with resolution at month 15. At month 18, after receiving two 6-mg/kg doses, he again had asymptomatic moderate ARIA-E, prompting dose suspension until resolution at month 21, followed by dose reduction to 3 mg/kg. At this point, a protocol amendment allowed titration to 10mg/kg, which was accomplished by month 24. At month 26, he developed asymptomatic mild ARIA-E, prompting dose reduction to 6 mg/kg, with resolution at month 28. At month 29, asymptomatic mild ARIA-E recurred, prompting further dose reduction to 3 mg/kg, with resolution at month 32. At month 35, he developed asymptomatic mild ARIA-E and mild ARIA–hemorrhage (ARIA-H) with mild superficial siderosis, prompting dose suspension, with ARIA-E resolution at month 36 and ARIA-H stability through month 39, followed by continued 3-mg/kg dosing. The trial was halted at month 44 of LTE after 31 aducanumab infusions with a cumulative dose of 124 mg/kg.

Discussion

Despite the controversy of the approval of aducanumab,1,2 there is a need to define ARIA management strategies for potential prescribers. ARIA-E occurred in 35% of trial participants receiving aducanumab at 10 mg/kg.3,4 APOE ε4 carriers were particularly susceptible, with 42% experiencing ARIA-E compared with 20% in noncarriers.3,4 Of the 46 participants who experienced ARIA-E in the phase 1b trial and LTE, recurrent episodes occurred in 8.5

We present a participant treated with aducanumab over 44 months with 6 asymptomatic ARIA episodes, the most in the 3 aducanumab trials. Though this participant never achieved sustained maintenance dosing of 10 mg/kg, the florbetapir positron emission tomography scan became visually normal at the interval scan following 21 doses with a cumulative dose of 91 mg/kg (global standardized uptake value ratio reduction, 1.29 to 1.05, using a whole-cerebellum reference region). Recent aducanumab appropriate use recommendations propose uninterrupted dosing through asymptomatic mild ARIA-E and ARIA-H and dose suspension for asymptomatic moderate to severe ARIA.6 This participant was treated largely in alignment with these recommendations, although with additional conservative measures taken for later episodes due to number of recurrences. This participant is an APOE ε4 carrier, which may have increased his ARIA risk. Appropriate use recommendations suggest a patient-centered discussion and consideration of testing, which may be particularly relevant to this patient.6 Although this case does not suggest a uniform strategy for ARIA management, it prompts consideration of APOE status, caution and vigilance during dose titration when ARIA is more likely to occur, dose suspension for moderate ARIA-E, and dose reduction or suspension in select circumstances, such as recurrent ARIA.
