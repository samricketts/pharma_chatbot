INTRODUCTION:

The projected growth of Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (AD/ADRD) cases by the mid-century has expanded the research field and impels new lines of inquiry into structural and social determinants of health (S/SDOH) as fundamental drivers of disparities in AD/ADRD.

METHODS:

In this review, we employ Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory as a framework to posit how S/SDOH impact AD/ADRD risk and outcomes.

RESULTS:

Bronfenbrenner defined the “macrosystem” as the realm of power (structural) systems that drive S/SDOH and that are the root cause of health disparities. These root causes have been discussed little to date in relation to AD/ADRD, and thus, macrosystem influences such as racism, classism, sexism, and homophobia are the emphasis in this paper.

DISCUSSION:

Under Bronfenbrenner’s macrosystem framework, we highlight key quantitative and qualitative studies linking S/SDOH with AD/ADRD, identify scientific gaps in the literature, and propose guidance for future research.

pmc1. Background

Incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) is unequally distributed among individuals and communities. There are persistent AD/ADRD disparities observed among racialized groups, sexual and gender identity groups, and among persons with varying socioeconomic resources. In 2020, the prevalence of AD was approximately two times higher among persons racialized as Black/African American than those racialized as White and 1.6 times higher among cisgender women than cisgender men.1,2 While evidence of AD/ADRD disparities is firmly established for some groups, research on the upstream factors that influence these disparities remains scarce.

Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the “conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, seek healthcare, and age.”3 Such conditions include economic stability (e.g., employment opportunities), social and community context (e.g., violence and social cohesion), access to and quality of health care, educational/occupational settings (e.g., school/workplace safety), and community/neighborhood-built environments (e.g., transportation, housing, and food access). These factors are often differentially distributed across populations through intentional systems of social, economic, political, and historical power structures that lead to poorer health outcomes among historically marginalized communities and sustained health disparities between hegemonic and non-hegemonic groups. Therefore, some scholars prefer the term “structural determinants of health” to signify the pervasiveness and deliberateness with which policies, societal norms and structures, and governing processes result in inequities in the distribution of power, resources, opportunities, and SDOH.4 The accumulated impact of structural and social determinants (henceforth S/SDOH) and associated inequities persists over the life course, negatively affecting physical health, mental health, brain health, and health-related behaviors, which can ultimately increase AD/ADRD-related risk, disparities, and inequities.

Investigating the relationship between S/SDOH and AD/ADRD requires the use of a theoretical framework precisely attuned to the complexities of this pathway. Although many ecological frameworks for health exist,5 most prior research has failed to operationalize and test S/SDOH instead emphasizing intermediary factors like individual-level socioeconomic status. Recently, several studies have begun to explicitly investigate the associations between S/SDOH and AD/ADRD related outcomes.5–9 A 2020 study of the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center cohort found that participants who lived in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (bottom 20% score on the area deprivation index versus remaining 80%) had 4.1% lower hippocampal volumes.10 However, the number of rigorously published studies is limited, and among these, S/SDOH concepts and measures are differentially defined.

Frameworks like the Conceptual Framework for Action on SDOH by the World Health Organization and the Public Health Framework for Reducing Health Inequities by the Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative outline structural determinants5—like governance, social and public policies, and societal values—as overarching factors that influence SDOH, and ultimately impact health behaviors, health, and wellbeing. However, Urie Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory11 explains pathways from and interactions between multiple systems on health, which bests demonstrates the complexity of S/SDOH as an exposure on AD/ADRD. To inspire greater inclusion of S/SDOH in AD/ADRD research, we highlight Bronfenbrenner’s Theory as a guiding framework.11 In this article, we emphasize what Bronfenbrenner termed the “macrosystem” as the realm of power systems that drive S/SDOH and are the root cause of health disparities.

In this article, we highlight quantitative and qualitative studies linking S/SDOH with AD/ADRD, identify scientific gaps, and propose guidance for future research. Unfortunately, there are insufficient studies on this topic to conduct a systematic review or a meta-analysis. Thus, consistent with a narrative review, we aim to provide a broad overview with select illustrative examples to offer a standardized way to conceptualize S/SDOH globally, in the context of AD/ADRD.

1.1. A global perspective

While much of the literature included in this article is situated in the United States (US), the impact of S/SDOH on AD/ADRD is global. In 2019, around 57.4 million people were living with AD/ADRD worldwide and the number is projected to increase to 152.8 by 2050.12 Early historical events like the Silk Road, Transatlantic Slave Trade, Great Depression, and World Wide Web have shaped the world in which we live into an ever-interacting global enterprise. From European colonization to pandemics, the geographic borders of nations do not prohibit the expansion of social phenomena. For instance, the same European countries that colonized the Americas, filtering their perspectives into the fabric of modern American nations like the US, were the same countries that colonized nations in Asia, Africa, Australia, and the Middle East—imposing their Euro-centric values, ideas, and practices that shaped these countries, which continue to shape and create disparities and inequities in these nations in the 21st century. Therefore, systems of power and discrimination are not exclusive to the US. Efforts to examine S/SDOH in different contexts should strongly consider how determinants may or may not apply in other regions of the world.

2. Methods: A guided framework

A conceptual framework that links S/SDOH to AD/ADRD outcomes must allow for the complex interplay between power structures; the social, political, and physical environments; and human behavior, which combine to influence epigenetics, physiology, and disease risk factors and outcomes. Bronfenbrenner’s Theory11 is a useful approach to understand the relationships between different S/SDOH in the context of AD/ADRD. It delineates five major systems that were originally postulated to influence human development—micro, meso, exo, macro, and chrono. The microsystems indicate the settings that individuals directly interact with (e.g., home, school). The mesosystem comprises the interactions between microsystems, and the exosystem involves the indirect factors that influence health (e.g., climate change). The macrosystem is made up of societal norms, beliefs, values, and practices (e.g., laws) that directly influence microsystems. Lastly, the chronosystem is composed of exposures to S/SDOH that occur throughout the life course or human development. Although a prior publication on AD/ADRD incorporated Bronfenbrenner’s theory, it was used to frame a discussion of a new data collection instrument and did not provide details on key aspects of the ecological system.13 We add to this literature by building a comprehensive examination of the macrosystem because of the weight of its influence on all the other systems including the microsystems that influence brain health and AD/ADRD.

2.1. The macrosystem

Bronfenbrenner describes the macrosystem as the outermost level, encompassing “patterns of ideology and institutional structure characteristics of a particular culture” (p. 9).11 Embedded within the ideologies and structures of the macrosystem is the global phenomenon of grouping persons. Whether grouping is justified for science (e.g., taxonomy) or the allocation of resources, assigning values to groups and differentially providing resources to those groups leaves a biopsychosocial mark on individuals and communities in ways that are recognizable in their health.

Macrosystem structures are intimately related to social stratification. Examples of ways we categorize persons include phenotypic characteristics, perceived gender (based on perceived body parts and gender expression), cognitive and physical functioning, sexual orientation/activity, religious affiliation/practice, country of origin, as well as language and accent. Projects like the Human Genome Sequencing Project indicate that categories like “race” are not reflected in our genes. Similarly, assessments of cognitive and physical functioning suggest that differences in ability are more closely aligned with social categories (e.g., racialized group, socioeconomic status).14 Such science would indicate that it is the value assigned to social groups, and subsequent allocation of resources to these groups that is the leading cause of health inequities. The science would also contend that the patterns of ideology that inspire the assignment of value to social groups is consistent across the globe and informs the institutional structures we live within.

Subsequently, Bronfenbrenner’s definition of the macrosystem bears weight in the application of the role of structural bias—capitalism, racism, sexism and genderism, and other biases—in AD/ADRD morbidity and mortality. Bronfenbrenner also included public policy as a component of the macrosystem that determines the everyday properties of the micro-, meso-, and exosystems by directing behavior and development (p. 9).11 Hence, as a working definition of the macrosystem for AD/ADRD research, we propose: The macrosystem refers to biased-based value systems that consistently underline a culture as a whole, and are expressed and transmitted intergenerationally through exo-, micro-, and meso-systems through public policies that steer institutional and individual biases across time.

It is important to distinguish the exo-, micro-, and meso-systems as the actors of bias, executing the values set by the macrosystem. The dissemination of macrosystem values may be reflected downstream in AD/ADRD disparities. These values may also be observable in the micro- and mesosystems themselves. An example of which is the 2020 Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention, Intervention, and Care that identified 12 modifiable risk factors (accounting for 40%) across the life course.15 Many of these risk factors (e.g., social isolation, physical inactivity, and air pollution) are contingent upon on the S/SDOH within the micro- and mesosystems. However, when those S/SDOH are ultimately structured by the macrosystem (e.g., residential segregation and education),16 then it is necessary to examine the upstream contributors of disparities. Below we provide examples of biased-based value systems contained within the macrosystem and the degree to which they have been examined in published AD/ADRD research.

2.2. The interaction between the micro and macro systems

According to Bronfenbrenner, “a microsystem is a pattern of activities, roles, and interpersonal relations experienced by the developing person in a given setting with particular physical and material characteristics” (p.22).11 An example of the microsystem is an individual’s neighborhood, where they may travel to various destinations, seek healthcare, and engage in socializing and physical activities. The ability to live in certain neighborhoods (freedom of choice) and the availability of resources and opportunities (e.g., healthcare) in each neighborhood are influenced by macrosystem factors like structural racism and classism. For instance, the macrosystem dictates healthcare access by establishing clinical care settings in areas outside of disadvantaged neighborhoods, delaying appointments and referrals, and preventing access to affordable treatments for marginalized groups.17 Similarly, macrosystem factors influence access to greenspaces like parks, gardens, open spaces, and other public or privately owned land that is composed of trees, flowers, grasses, shrubs, and other plants. Greenspaces provide opportunities for social engagement, physical activity, and clean air that improve mental health, cognitive activity, and the microbiome/immune system.18 Investment priorities into new greenspaces are often driven by macrosystem factors like societal values, power structures, and longstanding policies and practices. As a result, historically marginalized communities continue to experience reduced access to greenspaces and tree canopy, and in turn, have reduced opportunity to experience the health promoting benefits.19 Table 1 provides a list of microsystems influenced by the macrosystem that merit further research.

2.3. The interaction between the exo and macro systems

Climate change is an example of the indirect influence of the exosystem on health. Scientists worldwide have collectively cited anthropogenic climate change as the single greatest threat to the survival of numerous species, stability of multiple ecosystems, and overall planetary health.20 Climate change is driven by a complex interaction between excess pollution from fossil fuel use, deforestation, livestock farming, and ozone depletion—all arising from human activity. It is also deeply influenced by macrosystem values (e.g., neoliberalism, free-market economy) that have led to global pollution and jeopardized the planet’s sustainability. S/SDOH are impacted by adverse weather patterns (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, floods, heat waves, delays in seasonal cycles) as well as plans and policies, or lack thereof, to combat projected climate change. Severe and unpredicted weather events resulting from climate change are associated with varying access to potable water, food, and homes/shelters to sustain life, particularly for the most vulnerable populations (e.g., children, older adults, immigrants, refugees, those with chronic conditions).21 Educational institutions are often disrupted during inclement weather/disasters, jeopardizing learning for marginalized populations already experiencing a lack of access to schooling. In addition, policies promulgated to address air pollution and climate change (e.g., congestion charging and low emission vehicles) can result in differential access to affordable housing and transportation.21 The ensuing climate change has also engendered new public health and humanitarian crises by wiping out crops, reducing economic gross domestic products, igniting inflation, and increasing the risk of and morbidity and mortality from infectious (e.g., vibrio) and noncommunicable diseases (e.g., pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions).22 Residents in low-middle income countries and marginalized US communities are often too under-resourced to respond to acute crises, which in combination with other adverse exposures from the macrosystem, exacerbate the chronic stressors they endure. Marginalized and vulnerable populations already experience health inequities, and with exosystem exposures like climate change, they face multidimensional deprivation.23 Thus, climate change influences multiple AD/ADRD risk factors through its impact on S/SDOH.

3. Results: A globalized macrosystem

3.1. Capitalism and other social, economic, and class-based biases

Capitalism, the predominant economic system across the world, has led to the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of the elite few. Fundamental cause theory asserts that the link between socioeconomic position and health outcomes like AD/ADRD exist when the health benefits of money, knowledge, prestige, power, and social connections are made inaccessible to marginalized groups.24 Despite the world’s immense resources, capitalism incentivizes small groups of individuals, families, and communities to hoard wealth and resources, producing inequities in S/SDOH as well as health outcomes.25 While no AD/ADRD research directly investigates the role of capitalism and classism in disease etiology, there are aspects of capitalism and classism that have been studied. These studies provide some understanding of the role of capitalism and classism as manifested through an individual’s socioeconomic experience—education, employment, income, and housing. Inequitable distribution of socioeconomic assets, including early-life educational attainment and later-life wealth, explains racialized group disparities in dementia more substantively than do cardiovascular risk or health behaviors.26 Some features of occupation (e.g., manual vs. mental work; shift work) are known to be associated with risk for AD/ADRD.27–29 Research on individuals experiencing poverty and houselessness also suggest that they have greatly increased risk for AD/ADRD over the life course.30 Hence, employing a S/SDOH framework to examine capitalism and classism at a macrosystem level would reveal racial capitalism via occupational segregation increases AD/ADRD disparities over history (e.g., corporate oligarchies of today versus robber barons of the 19th century).31 The natural experiment of capitalism and classism on AD/ADRD could be captured in modern research by comparing the impact of privatized healthcare with national universal health care programs.32 Though with limited access to monetary resources that can increase opportunities for better quality of life (i.e., nutrient-rich foods, adequate housing, health care, health insurance, transportation, low pollutant neighborhoods with greenspace and recreation, internet, etc.), marginalized groups will continue to experience the greatest burden of AD/ADRD without economic intervention. This is an underexplored area of AD/ADRD that merits attention.

3.2. Structural racism and other social, cultural, and ethnic-based biases

Structural racism refers to a social system that assign individuals to racialized categories (i.e., race) based on phenotypic characteristics like skin tone, hair texture, and the structure of eyes, nose, cheekbones, and lips.33 After assignment (i.e., the process of racialization), opportunities and access to resources are structured based on the value assigned to each racialized category. Due to the legacy of European colonization, for many global contexts, persons racialized as White receive more opportunities and resources.34 In the US, structural racism expressed via residential segregation indicates that living in areas where a majority of residents are racialized as non-Hispanic Black is associated with increased dementia risk.35 This is due to residential segregation’s ability to reduce or eliminate access to good quality S/SDOH like education, employment/jobs, nutrient-rich foods, healthcare, transportation, spaces for safe physical activity within neighborhoods, and housing among other factors. Cognitive outcomes are also linked with structural racism as the odds of reporting poor subjective cognitive function doubles when women racialized as Black are exposed to racism within 5–6 microsystems —workplace, housing, police, courts, schools, healthcare—compared to 1–2.36 In these examples, structural racism directs S/SDOH to differentially treat and provide access to resources to persons racialized as Black. There are examples where persons racialized as Indigenous, Asian/Asian American, Latinx/a/o, or Middle Eastern experience similar discrimination, though this literature is underexamined in AD/ADRD research.

There are other related biases that operate similarly to racism. While “race” is a social construct not based in biology, ethnicity—also a misconstrued concept—refers to a shared cultural background between individuals. In the US, persons racialized as Latinx/a/o are considered an ethnic group because such persons trace their closest ancestor to a country in parts of North America, Central America, or South America. Ethnicity in this context implies region of birth or immediate ancestry within a fixed timeframe (i.e., since European colonization) as the defining characteristic of belonging to a group. Similarly, in India, there are distinct levels of social stratification ascribed to persons at birth that were mapped to one’s place or status within the society or community. The social hierarchy, referred to as a Scheduled Caste system (including Scheduled Tribes) in India, shares similar functions as the racial hierarchies found in other parts of the world. The historical practice of discriminating against minoritized groups, or “backward” castes as they are denoted in social surveys (e.g., Dalits), results in the same disproportionate access to resources like drinking water, education, employment opportunities, housing, income, marriage, kinship, and political participation.37,38 There are many other countries that have similar social hierarchies with varying terms to describe ethnic groups, social classes, and in many contexts, races. These distinctions are meaningful to note when conducting AD/ADRD research where values are assigned to groups and opportunities are unevenly distributed. Where social inequities exist, so too will AD/ADRD disparities.

3.3. Xenophobia and related biases (e.g., against migration status, language, and accent)

Xenophobia and related biases describe the ways social systems assign group membership and associated attitudes and stereotypes to a person based on their country of origin. Identifiers of national difference are often inferred from migration status, fluency in the majority group’s primary language, and/or the presence of an accent. In addition to general suspicion and other negative responses, these basic identifiers may undeservedly illicit39 negative encounters and experiences of acculturation leading to restricted access to resources that increases AD/ADRD risk.40 An example of such is disproportionate access to healthcare, which can result in delays in timely diagnosis and/or limited access to specialists and caregivers.41 For example, migrants experience factors throughout all stages of migration that may impact their health in both acute and long-term ways. Understanding acculturation in context42 includes acknowledging, among other things, changes in social networks, potential exposure to trauma (for refugees in particular), as well as discrimination and stigmatization that may occur through interactions with immigration enforcement and other members of the majority group’s society more broadly.43 These experiences shape health and wellbeing including cognitive health regardless of health insurance status or access to care.44,45

When accessing care, there is a dearth of clinicians and/or interpreters to provide medical assessments in the non-majority group language. Specific to cognitive aging and AD/ADRD risk, cognitive tests developed in one language are often translated and used in another language without proper validation or cultural consideration. Such lack of consideration may lead to confusion, frustration, and/or emotional distress, all of which negatively impacts not only cognitive performance, but also trust in medical providers. While large-scale epidemiological studies are beginning to investigate the construct validity and reliability of commonly used assessments46,47 in addition to cognitive protocols for the investigation of risk for and development of dementia, more work is needed in clinical settings where individual performance is critical to accurate identification of AD/ADRD and dementia staging. Furthermore, although accents play a powerful role in the categorization groups, less work has been done to understand how their presence may impact AD/ADRD-related outcomes either directly or indirectly.48,49

3.4. Religious bias

Religious bias or discrimination describes the prejudicial treatment of individuals based on religion or belief. It includes stereotyping individuals based on assumptions made about belonging to a religious group.50 In many parts of the world, religious freedom is threatened by national, institutional, and religious policies that play a significant role in interstate conflict, social upheavals, civil wars, and the persecution of minoritized religious groups.51,52 Religious bias has existed for centuries across the globe, including the persecution of the Jewish and Christian people by the Romans, the Holocaust, Uighurs in China, and attacks on the Rohingya people in modern-day Myanmar.53 These and other examples illustrate the global and historical magnitude of external, often colonial, forces imposing religious homogeneity and persecution on minoritized religious groups.54 Religious bias can be accompanied by capitalism, xenophobia, and other structural biases that have severe consequences for minoritized religious groups’ ability to access to land, policy, education, healthcare, and healthy foods and other life sustaining resources.55 In the US, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are on the rise56,57 and contribute to psychosocial stress associated with poor health outcomes that may also lead to increased AD/ADRD risk.

Although religious bias has not been formally studied in AD/ADRD research, it is a form of structural bias that hinders access to S/SDOH, imposes violence on minoritized religious groups, and restricts power to such groups that seek to intervene on their disadvantage.58 Further, religious bias embedded in the implicit biases of healthcare providers, government officials, and other authority figures heightens religious discrimination which is commonly associated with poor mental health, maladaptive coping behaviors, and health care-seeking behaviors.59 Therefore, religious bias may play a role in the development AD/ADRD and the health care of persons with AD/ADRD.

3.5. Structural genderism and related biases (e.g., transphobia and sexism)

Structural genderism describes the ways social systems support and reinforce a binary view of human bodies. Genderism assumes that the human body is sexually dimorphic (“female” and “male”), and further, that social roles can be ascribed to these bodies (i.e., a person with XX chromosomes is assumed to have breasts and take on the social role of cisgender female). This biologized-gender binary starts at birth with sex assignment and continues throughout the life course with a society encouraging its constituents to conform to one gender role, appearance/expression, identity, and set of behaviors based on how their body parts are externally perceived.60–63 Structural genderism encompasses transphobia (discrimination against transgender persons) and sexism (discrimination against cisgender females) by acknowledging there is an overarching bias against persons who do not conform to a society’s biologized-gender binary (i.e., discrimination against non-binary persons and gender diverse groups).

At the macrosystem level, genderism and its many forms (e.g., transphobia, sexism) are embedded in microsystems resulting in widespread discrimination across S/SDOH. Institutions like prisons and long-term care centers alike have gender segregated structures that impede and complicate healthcare access for gender diverse groups including delaying diagnosis and quality care for persons with dementia. Transgender adults who experience healthcare discrimination may be more likely to endorse subjective cognitive decline.64 Though, like with other S/SDOH, there is a dearth in the literature exploring the association between structural genderism and AD/ADRD.

Though meaningful differences exist. Studies examining subjective cognitive decline, which may be one of the first clinical manifestations of AD/ADRD,65 indicate sexual and gender minorities (SGM) adults may have a higher prevalence of subjective cognitive decline than non-SGM adults and may be more likely to experience related functional limitations.66,67 However, AD/ADRD risk factors, and other health inequities, are not uniformly experienced across SGM communities.68 An analysis of 2015 Medicare claims data revealed that transgender adults aged 65+ had a higher prevalence of dementia compared to cisgender adults (18% vs 12%).69 Transgender adults from racialized and minoritized groups may also be more likely to experience greater subjective cognitive decline than cisgender adults from racialized and minoritized groups and transgender adults racialized as White.70

Unfortunately, AD/ADRD research contributes to the bias-based practices that reinforce structural genderism. These practices include the systematic and purposeful omission of demographic measures used to identify gender diverse persons and participants within a healthcare system or research study, respectively.71 When included, gender diverse persons are often lumped together with sexual minorities (SGM) or some variation of LGBTIQQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, gay, transgender, intersex, queer, questioning, asexual). This makes it impossible to distinguish the effects of structural genderism on gender diverse persons apart from homophobia and related biases (see below).

Scientific participation in structural genderism also restricts the discourse on the role of sexism on AD/ADRD to biological differences between cisgender females and males.72–75 Though differences exist on how older adults protect their cognitive health, reduce their risk for cognitive decline, and manage cognitive changes,76 sexism as a determinant of chronic stress and access to health-sustaining resources, is not discussed. Much of the literature on structural genderism is severely limited by poorly defined approaches to measurement of sex and gender, and the underrepresentation and historical exclusion of gender diverse groups.77–80

3.6. Homophobia and related biases (e.g., biphobia)

Homophobia represents emotional responses, negative attitudes (i.e., myths, stereotypes, assumptions, biases), and discriminatory behaviors toward same-sex relationships, attractions, behaviors, and/or identities. Related terms for homophobia include “homosexism,” “heterosexism,” “sexual prejudice,” and “biphobia.” Homophobic experiences may lead to stress in sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, as well as additional identities), which increases risk for physical and mental health disparities. Past research on AD/ADRD-related outcomes finds that sexual minorities, or lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and additional identities, experience greater subjective cognitive decline and multimorbidity, including depression and functional limitations, than heterosexual adults.81,82 These findings reveal a pattern of poor health consequences for sexual minorities that, like other minoritized groups, may accumulate over the life course to influence AD/ADRD risk, and have dire consequences for older adults seeking to age in a safe environment.

3.7. Ableism

Ableism is reflected in stigma towards individuals with disabilities, including individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers. AD/ADRD stigma can lead individuals, including one’s social network and healthcare professionals, to patronize, stereotype, isolate, or discriminate against individuals with AD/ADRD.83 AD/ADRD stigma may represent a barrier to health care service utilization and has been observed even at preclinical stages of the disease,83,84 with worse prognosis associated with higher levels of AD/ADRD stigma.85 Beyond stigma and discrimination is the sheer lack of consideration and accommodation for persons with physical, cognitive, or developmental disabilities. A useful example is the principle of universal design, in which our built environments (e.g., building entrances, bathrooms, floors, sidewalks, and public spaces) are made accessible to the maximum extent possible through intentional designs that accommodate all individuals, regardless of ability. While universal design is used periodically in the US and has been used to help design care homes for persons with AD/ADRD globally,86 numerous examples demonstrate how our built environments are not planned and designed for the safety, wellbeing, and health of older adults, who often experience decreased abilities in vision, hearing, and mobility.87,88 Universally designed built environments, would increase accessibility to health promoting opportunities (e.g., places for physical activity, jobs, education) for all people and ultimately, may help protect against AD/ADRD by allowing individuals to live as independently and safely as possible. However, this interventional and policy research has not been explored in the context of AD/ADRD.

3.8. Ageism

At the macro-level, ageism reflects cultural values enacted through social institutions that diminish the value of older adults as integral members of a population.89 In modern society, with technological and medical advances as well as rapid globalization, old age is no longer valorized and associated with exceptional survival and wisdom, but is instead perceived as a source of frailty, economic expenditure, morbidity, and disability.89–91 Age is the strongest risk factor for AD/ADRD, and consequently, those with dementia often experience double stigma from ageism and ableism.90 Maltreatment and dismissal of persons living with AD/ADRD adversely impacts their social engagement, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and ability to access quality healthcare.92 Ageism is often pronounced for groups from marginalized experiences like those racialized and minoritized, perceived as cisgender women, with fewer socioeconomic resources, and/or houseless.93 Despite the inextricable link between age as the biggest risk factor for AD/ADRD, few studies explore the role of ageism in the quality of life and functional ability of persons living with dementia. Therefore, intervention and clinical trial research that reduces the mental, physical, and social needs of older adults living with dementia—as well as participatory research and community engagement—can aid medical professionals and caregivers in eliminating ageism.

3.9. Intersectionality

Racism, classism, ableism, sexism and genderism, and other biased-based values are social mechanisms that have been consciously and subconsciously developed to validate and justify inequities within societies.94 Due to the similarity in deployment of these biased-based systems, there is often intersectional oppression occurring. With origins in Black feminist theory, intersectionality is a theoretical and analytical framework that captures cross-cutting experiences and considers how interlocking systems of oppression, associated with social hierarchy, compound and create disadvantage.95 Several studies have applied an intersectional lens to examine how interrelated systems of oppression confer risk for AD/ADRD and may lead to disparities that disproportionately disadvantage marginalized communities. For example, gendered racism96,97—the simultaneous experience of racism and sexism—was associated with a higher number of cognitive complaints in US women racialized as Black.98 Another US-based study revealed meaningful differences at the intersection of racism and sexism in biological aging, an emerging risk factor for AD/ADRD.99 A large-scale study in the United Kingdom saw significant intersectional effects of gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity on biological markers of aging. This study reported that groups racialized as Black and other racialized and minoritized cisgender men with fewer educational opportunities had higher systolic blood pressure compared to other groups.100 Similarly, a population-based study in Malaysia found the prevalence of cognitive impairment was highest among older adults racialized as Malay who were more economically disadvantaged compared to older adults racialized as Malay who were not as economically disadvantaged.101 These studies highlight the importance of an intersectional approach in advancing our current understanding of AD/ADRD disparities globally. While the body of literature utilizing an intersectional framework remains scarce, this framework provides a critical opportunity to simultaneously analyze multifaceted power structures and processes that produce and sustain inequities in AD/ADRD and related outcomes.102

4. Discussion

4.1. The interaction between the chrono and macro systems across the life course

A life course approach to studying AD/ADRD is valuable for understanding how complex and varying genetic, environmental, behavioral, and social factors interact as we develop and age leading to disparate health outcomes. Recognition of the importance of sensitive periods and latency in the etiology of chronic disease is not new. The fetal origins of the adult disease hypothesis, which has most commonly been associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, is one of many theories that highlight the critical importance of understanding and measuring experiences well before disease onset.103 Given the interrelationship of cardiovascular and brain health, many of these same pathways are relevant for understanding the development of dementia.

A life course approach uses a multidisciplinary framework to elucidate how sensitive periods and latency affect dementia risk and exacerbate disparities and can help us understand how structural biases set the trajectory of risk and protective factors across the life course of an individual or community.104 Recent literature suggests early life exposure to structural racism via residential segregation put persons racialized as Black at disproportionate risk for AD/ADRD and are associated with lower cognitive function later in life.16,35,105 There is also strong evidence that suggests cumulative socioeconomic experiences due to an intersection of capitalism, racism, and likely other macrosystems—are prime indicators of AD/ADRD risk for marginalized populations.106,107 Such literature provides a blueprint for how to think about macrosystem exposures across the chronosystem.

4.2. Scientific gaps, challenges, and future directions

Some scientists do not yet fully appreciate how contextual factors, like structural biases, influence disease mechanisms. However, without exploring the role of societal policies and discriminatory practices on the development and experience of AD/ADRD, these scientists introduce tremendous bias into their research designs and analyses. Consideration of S/SDOH is necessary to advance our understanding of AD/ADRD and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Funders, training programs, researchers, journal editors, and institutions must encourage inclusion of S/SDOH into every study of AD/ADRD.

Simultaneously, AD/ADRD research must work to refine definitions, methods, and instruments that capture the role of structural biases on health. Research is needed to capture how multidimensional structural racism, sexism, and genderism influence AD/ADRD across the life course.12,24 There is a need for re-examination of how sex and gender are invoked in AD/ADRD so that gender is not limited to finite biologized categories. Methods, including measures, are needed to articulate how the intersection of structural biases operates and potentially accumulates to influence AD/ADRD etiology and patient outcomes. Culturally-responsive instruments are needed to measure cognition and other important AD/ADRD outcomes across diverse cultures, linguistic backgrounds, and ways of life.

Key research questions cannot currently be addressed due to lack of inclusivity of diverse populations in health research. This is certainly the case when examining the role of minority stress and discrimination due to xenophobia, religious bias, transphobia, and/or homophobia on AD/ADRD, cognitive impairment, and healthcare acess.108–110 Perhaps these gaps can be filled by the robust scholarship of researchers on the margins of AD/ADRD research whose lived experiences aid in identifying salient exposures on populations more diverse than the usual AD/ADRD non-Hispanic White, educated, cisgender, heterosexual, and able-bodied samples. Therefore, attention must be paid to the research of scholars from countries that are not primarily White and high-income but have innovative and meaningful AD/ADRD research to share. Thus, there are transformative opportunities for AD/ADRD research that integrates diverse data from across settings, cohort studies with traditionally excluded or underrepresented populations, and community-based participatory research that closes the gap between research and community.111

4.3. Conclusion

Health and its associated outcomes are never individually centered but are products of exposure to certain risk factors in varying magnitude, from cells to cities, and neurons to nations. The projected growth of AD/ADRD cases by the mid-century has expanded the research field and impels new lines of inquiry into S/SDOH as fundamental drivers of disparities in AD/ADRD. The extant literature has only tangentially examined the residual impact of these accumulated structural biases on the risk of AD/ADRD. This is narrative review provides a broad illustration fo the potential relationships between S/SDOH and AD/ADRD. The macrosystem in Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory identifies powerful societal forces that determine the foundation for health outcomes through biased-based value systems that propagate discrimination, and subsequently, health disparities across the life course. The intersection of these biased-based values has an enormous impact on individual, neighborhood, and population health, which is typified in the study of AD/ADRD and the differential risk for marginalized groups. Measurement of the macrosystem will provide valuable insight into how AD/ADRD risk and outcomes may be exacerbated by structural biases and discrimination. Researchers, clinicians, and policymakers should be aware of the macrosystem’s role and how it influences AD/ADRD health disparities.

Highlights

Ecological Systems Theory links structural/social determinants to AD/ADRD

Structural/social determinants accrue and interact over life course to impact AD/ADRD

Macrosystem is made up of societal norms, beliefs, values, and practices (e.g., laws)

Most macro-level determinants have been understudied in AD/ADRD literature

Theory-driven work is needed in the future to elucidate the roots of AD/ADRD disparities

Research in Context

1. Narrative review:

The authors searched health and social science databases such as PubMed and Web of Science for literature reviews and seminal papers examining associations between each structural/social determinant of health and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD).

2. Interpretation:

Powerful structural and social factors influence AD/ADRD risk and risk factors across the life course, but how these forces operate and interact causing disproportionate disease burden among vulnerable and marginalized populations of which many relationships have not been adequately examined.

3. Future directions:

This paper describes macrosystem factors (e.g., racism, sexism, classism, and homophobia) hypothesized to influence AD/ADRD-related outcomes and highlights preliminary studies that provide evidence for associations between these factors and AD/ADRD.
