Introduction:

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are a risk factor for dementia; however, their prevalence and severity among ethnoracial groups are poorly understood.

Methods:

We used data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) (n= 6958; ≥50 years old). Cognitively normal participants at baseline, without any NPS or dementia diagnosis, had at least one follow-up. Survival analyses assessed the hazard ratio for 12 NPS models and progression to cognitive impairment. Propensity score weighting (PSW) matched participants on age, sex, education, and race/ethnicity.

Results:

All 12 NPS were significantly associated with progression to cognitive impairment. In the PSW models, compared to whites, Black/African Americans were more likely to progress to cognitive impairment across all 12 NPS models, followed by Hispanic, and then Asian participants.

Discussion:

PSW minimized selection bias to provide robust risk estimates. There is a higher risk of progressing to cognitive impairment for ethnoracial groups with NPS. Tailored screening of NPS and cognitive impairment should incorporate patient and caregiver reports.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

The population of older adults is projected to reach 1.5 billion worldwide by 2050, when dementia prevalence is expected to grow to 152 million cases.1 Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), interchangeably called behavioral or psychological symptoms, are a major risk factor for dementia and vary in prevalence across dementia etiologies.2,3 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and NPS disturbances impact ~90% of patients with prodromal AD, often with multiple symptoms.4,5 A recent meta-analysis of 48 studies of NPS in AD identified apathy, depression, aggression, anxiety, sleep disorder, and irritability as the most prevalent symptoms.6 Delineating the time course of NPS in AD has significant clinical implications for improving diagnostic precision of AD versus other etiologies and distinguishing between phenotypic characteristics of AD subgroups to better tailor patient treatment.7

The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) offers a uniform, rich data repository with a well-characterized cohort across the contiguous United States.8 A number of studies using NACC data have examined NPS patterns as a risk for progression to dementia, both in the presence and absence of cognitive impairment. Depression, irritability, and multiple symptoms (e.g., apathy and nighttime behaviors) are associated with a higher risk of progression, ranging from cognitively normality, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia.9–11 Clustering of symptoms like nighttime behavior, apathy, depression, anxiety, and irritability portends a faster progression for AD specifically, and overall dementia.10,12 NPS as a risk factor and associated clustering profiles provide valuable information for understanding the time course of cognitive impairment.

With the increasing diversity among racial and ethnic groups, the United States will also see an increase in Black/African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians, whereas the non-Hispanic White (nHW) population growth will decrease over the next three decades.13 More importantly, Black/African Americans are at twice the risk of dementia, and Hispanics are at one and a half times the risk of dementia compared to nHWs.14 Most of the NPS studies in the literature have been conducted in homogenous, nHW samples. If there are studies on how NPS vary across ethnoracial groups, nHW groups typically have higher education and socioeconomic status, potentially complicating the relationship between NPS and progression to dementia. One recent study of a small sample in Texas suggests that there may be ethnic differences in NPS subtypes between Hispanics and nHWs for an elevated risk of MCI.15

Given variability in the clinical presentation of AD, especially among ethnoracial groups, factors like cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions, socioeconomic position, and access to and quality of health care influence the prevalence, expression, and duration of NPS subtypes.16 Among individuals with dementia, NPS evaluation and related treatment (pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments)17 can also vary across age, sex, gender, and ethnoracial groups.18 In this study, we leverage the NACC data repository to investigate whether there was a differential and longitudinal risk for cognitively normal adults from various ethnoracial groups and NPS in progressing to incident cognitive impairment compared to nHWs. We hypothesized that Black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian adults would have a higher risk for cognitive impairment over time and there would be a greater prevalence of NPS, specifically, apathy, depression, irritability, and nighttime behaviors.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Data source

We requested data (ID #1536) from NACC in October 2020 and were provided the June 2020 data freeze from the Uniform Data Set (UDS). Data were collected from 37 U.S.-based Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) and curated by NACC in Seattle, Washington. Participants provided informed consent, and institutional review board approval was locally obtained across ADCs (33 centers currently funded).

2.2 | Participants

The inclusion criteria for this study required participants to be (1) age 50 years or older, (2) cognitively normal at baseline as indicated by a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)19 of 0 and no impairment based on a presumptive etiologic diagnosis of AD, (3) did not report any NPS during their first/baseline visit assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q),20 and (4) have at least two visits. Additional data on education, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), depression diagnosis (self-report combined with observational data from the clinical interview), antidepressant use (Multum/Lexi-Comp therapeutic drug categories and identified prescription antidepressants), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were available. Overall, 6958 participants met the study inclusion criteria.

2.3 | Outcome measures

During the annual clinical assessment, a CDR is obtained along with presence of NPS, which is completed by the participant’s collateral source. Demographics are collected at each visit and self-reported race and ethnicity were uniformly self-reported per NACC protocol across ADCs. The NPI-Q is a 12-item, informant-based questionnaire that queries the presence (yes/no) and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of 12 symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, euphoria/elation, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor behavior, night-time behavior, and appetite/eating). NPI-Q questions were assessed separately as the presence (yes) or absence (no) of the symptom, regardless of the severity in subsequent follow-up visits for each participant over their respective enrollment period. When a specific NPS was ever endorsed, it was coded as 1 and if it was never endorsed, it was coded as 0. The analyses examined whether there was any association between NPS that was reported and progression to CDR &gt;0 (at end line) and whether the relationship differed by ethnoracial group.

2.4 | Statistical analyses

2.4.1 | Demographics

All analyses were completed in R (version 4.1.3). For the demographic variables, descriptive statistics, means, standard deviations, frequency, range, and percentages were reported for all continuous and categorical variables. In addition, statistical testing, χ2-test, and t-tests were reported where applicable when examining group differences.

2.4.2 | Propensity score and selection models

The NACC observational data set is imbalanced, since adults who develop cognitive impairment tend to be older, have fewer years of education, are more likely to be male, and from an ethnoracial group. In addition, there is a markedly lower number of ethnoracial participants compared to their nHW counterparts. We cannot directly assume that the NPS is associated with CDR without ruling out selection biases where the error term is not independent of observed covariates. To reduce the potential selection bias due to this imbalance in study design and participants’ characteristics, we used propensity scores. A propensity score is the probability of receiving treatment of interests (exposure in this case) based on a set of observed covariates, which are often used in four different ways: matching, stratification, covariate adjustment, and inverse probability of treatment weighting.21 We employed propensity score weighting (PSW) with the inverse probability of treatment weighting technique (IPTW—henceforth referred to as weighted models) in this study and used full matching as a sensitivity check.21–24 The ratio of participants who converted and did not convert was close to 1:4. Most of the Greedy matching methods such as nearest neighbor, reduces sample size to half, whereas the IPTW and optimal full matching retain the entire dataset, which was valuable for our study where race and ethnicity samples were smaller. We used the Olmos &amp; Bovindassmy procedure (2015)25 to perform PSW in R. We first created a selection model to estimate the propensity scores. The selection model, a logistic regression model, was used to estimate the selection bias on the model, where we included demographic variables that are often associated with the development of incident cognitive impairment. A logistic regression model (yes/no for CDR &gt;0 progression) estimated the propensity score for each participant and the overall probability of progression for each participant based on their age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education.

Optimal full matching is a stratification method and was used as a sensitivity check. After a propensity score was generated, the entire sample was stratified based on the distance of propensity scores between the participants who progressed toward CDR &gt;0 (incident cognitive impairment) and those who did not. The goal of stratification is to minimize the distance between means of the propensity score within the matched sets. Each participant in a stratum of the sample who progressed was matched with multiple participants who did not progress. After matching, a stratum and a weight were generated for each participant.

2.4.3 | Survival analyses

The outcome variable for the survival analyses was time from baseline visit to the first occurrence of CDR ≥0.5 in follow-up visits. The survival time for the participants who never progressed to CDR ≥0.5 on subsequent visits was treated as “right-censored.” NPS was our main effect/exposure of interest, with a secondary focus on race/ethnicity, whereas the model also adjusted for sex, age, and years of education. Cox proportional hazards model (coxph function) was used for the 12, unweighted model assessing the main effects of race and NPS on Incident Cognitive Impairment (ICI). For the weighted (IPTW) selection model, the inverse propensity score was added in as a weight into the prior survival analyses to estimate the effects of NPS on progression to cognitive impairment. We conducted a sensitivity check using optimal full matching with the same Cox proportional hazards model. Both stratum and weight were used in estimating the risks of conversion. We used the MACTCHIT package to conduct the full matching procedure to estimate effects.26

2.4.4 | Secondary models

We ran two additional analyses to examine secondary outcomes. We assessed the same weighted (IPTW) models but transformed the NPI-Q into five domains (decreased motivation, affective dysregulation, impulse dyscontrol, social inappropriateness, abnormal perception or thought content) based on the Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI) questionnaire27 for comparison across ethnoracial groups. Collapsing the NPI-Q into the five MBI clusters affords cross-comparison with other studies that employ the MBI to measure NPS in different study populations. Finally, to examine whether the results were affected by cardiovascular conditions, we computed a composite score based on our prior work28 and re-ran the 12 weighted (IPTW) model.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Participant demographics

Among the 6958 participants included in this study, ~20.78% progressed to CDR &gt;0. The mean follow-up for the sample was 4.84 years (SD = 3.47), with a range of 14.7 years. Follow-up was shorter for those who progressed to cognitive impairment (mean = 4.25, SD = 3.09) compared to those who did not (mean = 5.00, SD = 3.55) (see Table 1). Most participants endorsed approximately one symptom on the NPI-Q over follow-up (mean = 1.13, SD = 1.78). Participants who developed cognitive impairment endorsed slightly more symptoms (mean = 2.67, SD = 2.53) compared to those who did not (mean = 0.73, SD = 1.25) (Figure 1). The results were similar for the MBI. Participants who progressed had slightly lower scores on the MMSE, were more likely to endorse using antidepressants, had a higher prevalence of APOE ε4+, and had a greater likelihood of dying at a subsequent follow-up. There were no differences in depression diagnosis between those who remained cognitively normal compared to those who progressed.

There were more female than male participants in the sample (67.7% vs 32.3%); however, the percentage of male participants who progressed to cognitive impairment was higher than female participants (22.5% vs 20.0%). Participants who progressed to cognitive impairment had slightly fewer years of education (mean = 15.6, SD = 3.01) than those who did not (mean = 16, SD = 2.81). Within the sample, 76% self-identified as nHW, 16.4% as Black/African American, 4.5% as Hispanic, 2.69% as Asian, and 0.36% as American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN). Asian participants had the highest number of years of education, followed by nHW, AIAN, Black/African American, and Hispanic. Because AIAN had a small sample size (n = 25), we were unable to include them in the unweighted/weighted survival models due to statistical power.

In an unweighted survival model examining risk of progression to cognitive impairment across race/ethnicity (adjusting for age, sex, education), compared to nHW, Black/African American participants had slightly higher hazards for progressing (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.32; p = 0.026), Hispanic participants were marginally significant (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.99–1.52; p = 0.060), and Asian participants were not significant (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.95–1.75; p = 0.11). NPS was not included in these survival models.

3.2 | NPS: unweighted and weighted (IPTW) models

We ran Cox proportional hazards models (n = 6933) without and with propensity score weights. In the unweighted models, all 12 NPS, sex, and age were statistically significant and associated with progression to incident cognitive impairment. The HRs for the risk of progression were 3.00–3.58 times higher for delusion, motivation, disinhibition, and irritability models, and 2.00–2.90 times higher for hallucinations, apathy and agitation models (Table 2). The HRs for the remaining NPS ranged from 1.71–1.88. Hispanic participants had significantly higher hazards compared to nHWs.

In the weighted/IPTW models, all 12 NPS were still associated with a higher hazard for progression (Table 3). Black/African American participants were more likely to progress to cognitive impairment across all 12 NPS models compared to nHWs, equating to a 15%– 23% higher hazard (p &lt; 0.05) across when any one NPS was present. Hispanic participants had significantly greater hazards (24%–28%) for six NPS models (agitation, disinhibition, irritability, motor disturbance, nighttime behavior, and appetite and eating). Asian participants had significantly higher hazards (39%–40%) for two NPS models (depression, apathy) for progressing. The ADC site was included in the models but the results did not change. Finally, the optimal full-matching models as a sensitivity check showed results similar to IPTW models (results not presented).

3.3 | Secondary outcomes: Weighted (IPTW) models

In the MBI-weighted models, Black/African Americans had a higher hazard across all five subscales (16%–28%) compared to nHWs (Table 4). Hispanics had a higher hazard for impulse dyscontrol (28%) and social inappropriateness (24%), whereas Asians had a corresponding higher hazard for decreased motivation (39%) and emotional dysregulation (41%). The cardiovascular composite was not statistically significant in any of the 12 models, and there were no changes in any of the group differences (results not presented).

4 | DISCUSSION

Black/African Americans and Hispanics are at a significantly higher risk for dementia compared to nHWs.29,30 However, only a handful of studies have directly examined the association between NPS and progression to MCI or dementia across race/ethnicity.15,31–33 To our knowledge, this is the first, large-scale study to investigate ethnoracial differences in NPS and the risk of progressing to cognitive impairment in a well-characterized, cognitively normal cohort over a 14-year follow-up. The NACC’s prospective, longitudinal design is agnostic of any hypothesis driven biases, thus serving as an optimal data repository to investigate this question. Most importantly, the analyses did not simply adjust for race and ethnicity in the models. We empirically derived weights for each participant while adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and education, and then compared the likelihood for progressing to cognitive impairment, allowing for a direct comparison of hazards within each ethnoracial group.

In the unweighted models, each of the 12 NPS were independently associated with a three-fold higher hazards risk for progressing to incident cognitive impairment (ICI) for individuals who endorsed delusions, disinhibition, irritability, and motor disturbances, which was followed by a two-fold or greater risk for progressing to ICI for hallucinations, agitation, and apathy. The unweighted model also showed that Hispanic adults had an independently higher hazard risk (53%–72%) for progressing across all NPS compared to their nHW counterparts. When the IPTW weighting was applied to the survival models, Black/African American participants had a higher risk for all NPS models, Hispanic participants had a higher hazard risk for six NPS, whereas Asian participants had a higher risk in the depression and apathy models compared to nHW participants. A prior study using NACC data assessed the relationship between NPS and risk of progression to MCI, incident AD, and dementia and found that Black/African American and Hispanic older adults have a lower risk of conversion.34 However, this study included race/ethnicity as a covariate only in their survival models, along with age and MMSE score. A study of symptomatic patients (diagnosed with AD or mixed-dementia) found that Black/African American older adults had more psychotic symptoms (delusions and hallucinations) compared to nHW patients.32 Another study of cognitively normal older adults determined that a physical behavior cluster (nighttime behavior and eating disturbances) was more significantly associated with the risk of progression to MCI among Hispanics, whereas a psychomotor apathy cluster (including agitation, irritability, apathy) was strongly associated with progressing among Hispanics compared to nHWs.15 Our findings replicate the nighttime behavior and eating disturbances NPS but also support agitation and irritability as also being associated with progression to cognitive impairment among Hispanics compared to nHWs. Prior studies that report null results (i.e., no difference between groups) likely fall prey to selection bias by not adjusting for demographics within the group, which may influence survival outcome models in determining the risk between NPS and progression to incident cognition impairment.

MBI is posited to be a late onset of behavior and personality changes that increase the risk of progressing from cognitive normality to MCI to prodromal dementia and may serve as a premonitory stage presenting a change from baseline that is not explained by psychiatric conditions.27,35,36 The MBI models recapitulated the same results as the NPS models since the 12 domains were converted into five and endorsement of one symptom in an MBI domain indicates positivity. Compared to nHWs, Black/African Americans had a greater risk of progressing across the five domains, Hispanics had a higher progression risk for impulse dyscontrol and social inappropriateness, and Asians had a high risk for progressing for decreased motivation and emotional dysregulation. Based on the MBI’s domain structure, these results suggest differential behavioral patterns by race and ethnicity, which could support tailoring screening and subsequent treatment, as well as warranting further investigation of causal factors explaining these differences.

NPS may accumulate at the same rate across ethnoracial groups; however, Black/African Americans and Hispanics may not admit or seek treatment as early as their nHW counterparts, thus delaying a potential diagnosis and potential treatment.37 As a result, symptom severity may compound and also increase the risk of progressing to cognitive impairment.38 A recent study using NACC data found that Black older adults with dementia had twice the risk of delusions and hallucinations, in addition to a higher risk for agitation/aggression, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbances, abnormal nocturnal behavior, and appetite/eating changes compared to nHWs.39 The onus of healthcare seeking behavior is not singularly fixed with the individual patient or their family. It is a complex interaction between acculturation, healthcare access and affordability, trust in formal medical institutions, stigma, awareness, and intergenerational health disparities, among others.16,40,41 Race and ethnicity are fundamental to identity but are rudimentary proxies for social and environmental determinants of health dimensions like education, socioeconomic status, structural racism, discrimination, outdoor and indoor pollution, and area-level deprivation—all of which increase the risk for both NPS and dementia.

The findings from this longitudinal study strongly suggest that Black/African American and Hispanic adults have higher hazards of progressing to cognitive impairment while adjusting for different NPS. Presently, there is insufficient evidence to aver whether NPS subdomains are relevant to a particular group cluster or if the NPS endorsed may be indicative of other comorbid conditions. Race and ethnicity are not monoliths, and it would be ill-advised to typecast NPS domains or clusters to a particular race or ethnicity. Nevertheless, the findings of this study have important clinical implications, given the stronger associations between NPS and progression to ICI for Black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian adults. Reporting or expressing negative affect or mood state may be antithetical to certain cultural values, gender norms, or family beliefs. NPS assessment should be completed independently by the patient and a collateral source (caregiver, family, or friend) to provide multiple perspectives and awareness of symptom prevalence and severity. For example, depression and apathy were two NPS that increased the risk of progression to cognitive impairment for Asian participants. The NPI-Q may be used as a general screen to detect NPS, whereas additional assessments (e.g., Patient Health Questionaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) could delve further and examine the magnitude. Inquiry into life events and stressors is also highly recommended to address potential factors that may be mediating or moderating the relationship between NPS and cognitive impairment.

Most studies assessing NPS as a risk factor for various dementia etiologies have adjusted for race/ethnicity. Prior work42,43 using Monte Carlo simulation studies comparing different matching methods with survival models have concluded that IPTW selection results in lower mean square error and that full matching (comparable performance with IPTW) has superior performances compared with Greedy matching methods. The PSW methodology adopted here first compares the risk of progressing to cognitive impairment within ethnoracial groups to reduce selection bias, and then compares the groups to determine differences in hazard function among ethnoracial groups.

5 | LIMITATIONS

Despite the large sample size and longitudinal follow-up, there are some limitations to this study. Although the CDR was used as the outcome, adjudication may be a more robust, gold standard for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment. However, given that there is noted variability across ADCs in what factors are accounted for in making an etiological diagnosis, the CDR was used for its uniformity. Although some work29 suggests a higher risk of dementia among AIAN, we were forced to exclude the group in the survival analyses due to the small number of participants. The NPI-Q data collected in the UDS relies on a collateral source or informant report that may not be accurate or reliable. As reported previously,44 the sampling/recruitment strategies for Black/African Americans and nHW participants differ based on the community, and this may also impact Hispanics, Asians, and AIANs. The endline data considered only the first instance of progression of CDR &gt;0 and did not account for clinical fluctuations where CDR may have reverted back to 0 or cognitively normal. Similarly, we did not assess dementia etiologies or decedent data to determine pathological confirmation for those who died upon follow-up. Indeed, a recent study identified unique NPS signatures for different neuropathological diagnoses of AD and related dementias.45 Finally, the MBI domains in this study were generated based on a crosswalk between domains of the MBI and NPI-Q; however, these are approximations compared to the MBI criterion using the original instrument.

We found that all 12 NPS were associated with a higher hazard of progressing to cognitive impairment, and there was an elevated risk for Black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian adults compared to nHWs. A more comprehensive screening of NPS is required in nHW populations, which could be woven into the patient history and physical clinical data collection—but it is important to address the cultural factors and stigma that may influence self-report. A better understanding of the prevalence and risk of specific NPS will help to improve screening and formal assessment of AD and other dementia etiologies to advance clinical care of outcomes.

RESEARCHINCONTEXT

1. Systematic Review:

We searched the literature for studies investigating the risk associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and progression to cognitive impairment and whether there was a differential risk by ethnoracial groups. NPS increase the risk of progression to prodromal dementia, with most studies including non-Hispanic White samples. If race/ethnicity was included, they were covariates.

2. Interpretation:

There was an increased hazard risk of progressing to cognitive impairment with 12 NPS. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, Black/African Americans had an increased risk in 12 NPS models, Hispanics for 6 NPS, and Asians for 2 NPS. NPS increase cognitive impairment risk for all, but there is a higher burden where different NPS may present at a higher prevalence across ethnoracial groups.

3. Future Directions:

Screening and diagnosis may reduce delayed diagnoses among minoritized groups. Future studies need to examine within-group heterogeneity, and ethnoracial groups need to be considered as more than just covariates.
