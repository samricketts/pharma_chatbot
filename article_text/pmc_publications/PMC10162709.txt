Aims:

To assess associations that endogenous estradiol and testosterone levels have with cognitive function in older adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods:

We use data from the Look AHEAD clinical trial of behavioral weight loss. Endogenous estradiol and total testosterone levels were determined using stored serum from 996 individuals, mean age 69 years, at two times (averaging 4 years apart) during years 8–18 of follow-up. One to four standardized assessments of attention, executive function, memory, and verbal fluency were collected during this follow-up. Mixed effects models and multiple imputation were used to assess associations that estradiol and total testosterone levels had with body mass index and cognitive function.

Results:

Estradiol levels were not associated with cognitive function in either sex. Total testosterone levels were not associated with cognitive function in women, but greater total testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency in men (p &lt; 0.001), most strongly among those carrying the APOE-e4 allele (interaction p = 0.02). The weight loss intervention left a legacy of relatively lower cognitive functioning among women, which was not mediated by current levels of sex hormones.

Conclusions:

Behavioral weight loss intervention does not affect cognitive functioning through mechanisms related to estradiol or testosterone.

pmc1. Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (TD2M) accelerates cognitive decline in both women and men.1,2 Among older women, there is evidence that higher endogenous estradiol levels may further accelerate the cognitive decline associated with T2DM. The Three-City Study reported that older women with T2DM who had endogenous estradiol levels in the highest quartile of the cohort’s distribution were at 14 times the risk for dementia over four years compared with women with T2DM whose estradiol levels were in the mid-quartiles, although this finding was based on a limited number (N = 14) of cases.3 Increasing estradiol levels by postmenopausal hormone therapy among older women with T2DM raises their risk for cognitive deficits, brain atrophy, and dementia.4,5 These findings may be explained by the “healthy cell bias” theory, which posits that the positive impact of estrogen on energy metabolism of brain cells in younger women wanes, and even reverses, as women get older, and that this process may he accelerated with T2DM.6 It is not known whether these concerns also extend to men, i.e. whether higher levels of endogenous estradiol levels in men accelerate T2DM-related cognitive decline.

Testosterone may also interact directly with cognitive decline in T2DM, or through its conversion to estradiol via the aromatase enzyme. While there is evidence that higher levels of testosterone are generally associated with better cognitive function (i.e. memory, spatial ability) in both sexes,7 there is also evidence for a healthy cell bias in which higher levels of testosterone may adversely affect cognitive function in the presence of underlying neuropathology.8 T2DM may contribute to this neuropathology, and higher levels of testosterone may also increase this by accelerating oxidative stress.9,10

We make use of the well-characterized cohort of the Look AHEAD study, ages 45–76 at baseline, with established T2DM. All members had overweight or obesity when enrolled in a 10-year randomized controlled clinical trial of behavioral weight loss intervention. Estradiol and testosterone levels were assayed from samples collected proximal to the end of the intervention, and again an average of four years later. Longitudinal standardized cognitive assessments were performed over this time span. Our primary goal was to examine whether relatively higher levels of estradiol and testosterone were adversely associated with cognitive functioning in these women and men. We also examined whether the weight loss intervention resulted in a legacy of altered cognitive function and, if so, whether this might be related to differences in levels of estradiol and testosterone. Because sex hormones may be differentially associated with cognitive sub-domains in women versus men,11,12 we examined the consistency of relationships across domains of attention, executive function, verbal memory, and verbal fluency.

2. Materials and methods

The Look AHEAD design, methods, and CONSORT diagram have been published previously.13,14 Look AHEAD was a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial that recruited 5145 individuals (during 2001–2004). All participants had T2DM and met the following criteria: 45–76 years of age, BMI &gt; 25 kg/m2 (&gt;27 kg/m2 if on insulin), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt; 97 mmol/mol (11 %), systolic/diastolic blood pressure &lt; 160/&lt;100 mmHg, triglycerides &lt; 600 mg/dl, and successful maximum graded exercise testing. Protocols and consent forms were approved by local Institutional Review Boards.

The Look AHEAD MIND ancillary study administered standardized cognitive assessments to the cohort and performed analyses of stored samples on a subset of participants, oversampling those enrolled at clinical sites that had participated in prior ancillary studies involving cognitive assessment15,16 and/or had prior study-based classifications of mild cognitive impairment or dementia when these were done, approximately four years earlier during follow-up.17

We excluded assessments from women who were premenopausal or currently taking postmenopausal hormone therapy (N = 153 excluded assessments). We also excluded assessments from men currently taking androgen supplements (N = 33 excluded assessments). This resulted in a sample of N = 996 participants.

2.1. Interventions

Participants had been randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) or diabetes support and education (DSE). ILI targeted reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity to induce and maintain weight loss to average &gt; 7 %.18,19 Caloric consumption goals of 1200–1800 kcal/day were based on initial weight. Physical activity of &gt;175 min/week through activities similar in intensity to brisk walking was also targeted. Cardiometabolic risk factors (lipids, HbA1c, blood pressure) were monitored. Participants were provided results, which were, in turn and with consent, shared with their clinicians. During the first six months, ILI participants attended three group meetings and one individual session per month. For the remainder of the first year, they were provided two group and one individual meeting per month. The intensity of the intervention gradually decreased thereafter.

DSE participants were invited to three group sessions each year that focused on diet, physical activity, and social support. They did not receive specific diet, activity, or weight goals or information on behavioral strategies, but had similar cardiometabolic risk factor monitoring as ILI participants.

Interventions were terminated September 2012. The mean (standard deviation) lengths of the intervention period for ILI and DSE participants in this manuscript were both 9.9 (1.7) years.

2.2. Cognitive assessment

Centrally trained, certified, and masked staff conducted standardized assessments of cognitive function in the full Look AHEAD cohort in years 11–13 from baseline (i.e. enrollment into the Look AHEAD trial).20 Look AHEAD MIND repeated assessments in years 14–18.16 One or two other assessments, for those participating in ancillary studies, occurred during years 8–13. The cognitive battery included the following tests: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning, Digit Symbol Coding, Modified Stroop Color and Word Test, Trail Making Test-Part B, and Modified Mini-Mental Status Exam (3MSE). Scores were standardized (z-scores) by subtracting the overall cohort-wide mean of the initial assessments and dividing this by their standard deviation, ordering so that higher scores reflected better performance.20

To condense our presentation, we used the following loosely defined domains. Verbal memory was defined as the average of the Rey immediate and delayed task z-scores. Executive function was defined as the average of the Stroop and Trails-B z-scores. Attention was based on the Digit Symbol z-score. Verbal fluency was based on the z-score for the animal naming task of the 3MSE. We report results for these four domains and the cognitive composite score (average of all test z-scores), the primary outcome of Look AHEAD MIND.

A masked panel of experts adjudicated cognitive status to identify mild cognitive impairment and dementia using all available data.21 Potential cases included participants whose 3MSE test scores fell below pre-specified age- and education-specific cut points for their cognitive assessment between August 2013 and December 2014, and again between May 2018 and February 2020, one assessment per epoch. This simultaneously triggered the telephone administration of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) to a friend or family member identified by the participant to query functional status in instrumental activities of daily living.

2.3. Estradiol and testosterone assays

Hormone assays were conducted on serum samples collected once during each of two epochs: during mid follow-up (Epoch 1: years 8–13; age range 53.6 to 86.0 years) and an average of 4 years later (Epoch 2: years 14–18; age range 59.2 to 89.9 years). Analyses were conducted centrally at Medpace, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio.

Serum estradiol levels were determined using Roche reagent (Elecsys Estradiol III) on a Cobas e801 Immuno-analyzer. This chemiluminescence immunoassay, fully validated in the laboratory, employed a competitive test principle using two monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against 17β-estradiol. Endogenous estradiol released from the sample competes with the added estradiol derivative labeled with a ruthenium complex for the binding sites on the biotinylated antibody. The assay limit of quantification was 20.0 pg/mL and the reference range is &lt;50 pg/mL in adult males and 0–451 pg/mL in adult females. Three quality control samples with low, medium, and high levels of estradiol were analyzed in each run and the between assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 3.4 %, 3.3 %, and 3.9 %, respectively.

Total testosterone levels in serum were determined using Roche reagent (Elecsys Testosterone II) on a Cobas e801 Immuno-analyzer. This electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, fully validated in the laboratory, employed a competitive test principle using a monoclonal antibody specifically directed to testosterone. The assay limit of quantification was 0.03 ng/mL and the reference range is 2.7–10.7 ng/mL in adult males and 0.06–0.86 ng/mL in adult females. Three quality control samples with low, medium, and high levels of testosterone were analyzed in each run and the between assay CVs were 3.4 %, 5.0 %, and 1.8 %, respectively.

2.4. Collateral data

Certified masked clinic staff collected collateral data.13 Participants were given the following options to report race/ethnicity: i) Are you Latino, Hispanic, or of Spanish origin, and for those answering no, ii) Which best describes you (multiple choices were allowed): African American/Black; American Indian/Alaskan Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander; White; and/or Other. Race/ethnicity was included as a covariate in analyses to account for potential biases in cognitive assessment methods. Digital scales were used to obtain annual measures of weight. Participants brought current prescription medications and supplements to update medication records: exclusions for postmenopausal hormone therapy and androgen supplements were based on these. Blood specimens were collected after a ≥12-hour fast and analyzed centrally for HbA1c. For participants who provided consent, TaqMan genotyping for APOE-e4 (the rs7412 allele) was performed.

2.5. Statistical analysis

We divided follow-up into two phases: Epoch 1 (years 8–13) and Epoch 2 (years 14–18). Not all cognitive assessments and biospecimens for hormone assays were collected at the same time, and some participants had multiple cognitive assessments within epochs. We used mixed effects models for longitudinal data to bin log-transformed cognitive assessments into these epochs, with covariate adjustment for current age, HbA1c, and body mass index (BMI); intervention assignment; epoch; time between blood collection for assays and cognitive function assessment; and education and race/ethnicity. These models were used to examine associations that cognitive function scores had with sex hormone levels and whether these varied by cognitive impairment status.

The majority of estradiol levels for women were below the detectable level of our assay (20 pg/mol). For reference, the normal range for postmenopausal women is 0 to 30 pg/ml, with mean &lt; 10 pg/m.22,23 We therefore limited our analyses of estradiol levels in women to a binary categorization of above or below this threshold, but also examined whether there were graded associations between estradiol and cognitive function for women with measurable levels. We had more complete data for estradiol levels for men and for testosterone levels for both sexes. For these, we used Bayesian multiple imputation to impute estradiol and total testosterone levels that were below assay’s detectable levels.24,25 This approach is expected to yield greater validity than imputing a single fixed value for these missing data. Briefly, we assumed that the log-transformed estradiol and total testosterone levels, conditional on age and BMI and separately for women and men, followed a multivariate normal distribution. Ten multiply imputed datasets were developed for analyses.

3. Results

Table 1 describes differences between women and men, the most marked being relatively less education and greater race/ethnicity diversity among women compared with men.

As seen in Table 2, women tended to have lower estradiol levels than men at both epochs. As noted above, many more women had estradiol levels below the detectable threshold (20 pg/ml than men: &gt;70 % compared with 12–13 %. Women also had lower levels of testosterone, with a greater proportion who had values below the detectable level of 0.3 ng/ml and also lower means among assays above the detectable level. There was little overall change in hormone levels from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2.

As seen in Table 3, at Epoch 1 there was little legacy of weight loss from ILI among women, but a modest legacy of weight loss among men, which had attenuated by Epoch 2. At both time points, mean (SE) BMI was greater among women with estradiol levels exceeding the threshold compared with those with lower levels [Epoch 1: 35.7 (0.5) kg/m2 vs 33.4 (0.3) kg/m2 (p &lt; 0.001); Epoch 2: 35.9 (0.5) kg/m2 vs 32.9 (0.3) kg/m2 (p &lt; 0.001)]. Based on multiple imputation analyses, BMI was also positively associated with testosterone among women (Epoch 1: p = 0.004; Epoch 2: p = 0.01) and relationships were similar between intervention groups (p = 0.41 and 0.93 for estradiol and p = 0.44 and 0.08 for testosterone at Epochs 1 and 2, respectively). Among men, greater BMI was associated with higher estradiol levels (Epoch 1: p = 0.003; Epoch 2: p = 0.01), but lower testosterone levels (Epoch 1: p &lt; 0.001; Epoch 2: p = 0.08) and relationships were similar between intervention groups (at Epoch 1 and Epoch 2 respectively, p = 0.63 and 0.44 for estradiol and p = 0.13 and 0.17 for testosterone). Percent loss in BMI from baseline was modestly associated with lower estradiol and testosterone levels among women (p = 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001 for estradiol at Epoch 1 and Epoch 2, respectively; p = 0.01 and p = 0.01 for testosterone at Epoch 1 and Epoch 2, respectively), but not among men (all p &gt; 0.20).

As seen in Table 4, greater estradiol levels were not related to scores in any cognitive domain or the composite in both women and men. Testosterone levels were similarly not related to cognitive function in women, however in men, higher testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency (but not for other domains). We examined whether this association varied according to APOE-e4 genotype. Among the 363 men with genotyping, 70 (19.3 %) had one or two APOE-e4 alleles. Among this subtype, relatively high testosterone levels were more strongly related to verbal fluency than among men not carrying the APOE-e4 allele, with fitted slope 0.361 log(pg/ml)/SD [95 % CI 0.178,0.543], p &lt; 0.001, compared with non-carriers, whose fitted slope was 0.104 log(pg/ml)/SD [−0.019,0.227], p = 0.10 (interaction p = 0.02). Among the 475 women with genotyping (22.3 % APOE-e4 carriers), there was no evidence of an association between higher testosterone levels and verbal fluency in APOE-e4 carriers (22.3 %) and non-carriers (interaction p = 0.46).

Among women (Fig. 1), random assignment to ILI had a legacy of modestly lower cognitive Test scores, most strongly for executive function (p = 0.03) and the composite (p = 0.02). Covariate adjustment for estradiol and testosterone levels did not attenuate these differences. Among men, there was little difference in mean cognitive function between intervention groups and covariate adjustment for estradiol and testosterone levels had no influence.

We enriched our sample to have increased rates of cognitive impairment at Epoch 1, but not at Epoch 2. The cognitive adjudication conducted during Epoch 1 classified 11.9 % of the females to have mild cognitive impairment and 1.7 % to have dementia. Among males at this time, the rates were 20.8 % with mild cognitive impairment and 1.9 % to have dementia. During Epoch 2 adjudications, the rates were lower, likely due to our sampling plan: among women rates were 8.2 % mild cognitive impairment and 1.7 % dementia, and among males rates were 10.7 % mild cognitive impairment and 2.7 % dementia. An anonymous reviewer recommended that we examine whether there were associations between sex hormone levels and cognitive function separately among women and men grouped by cognitive impairment status. There were no associations between estradiol levels and cognitive function in either group for women and for men (data not shown). Supplemental Exhibit S1 portrays associations that testosterone levels had with cognitive function and provides evidence that among men, but less strongly so if at all among women, greater testosterone levels were associated with better cognitive function (i.e., composite cognitive function and memory) among those classified as having cognitive impairment.

4. Discussion

Our analyses have yielded three main points. First, in a large cohort of older individuals with T2DM, levels of endogenous estradiol and total testosterone were significantly related to BMI, but did not differ between intervention groups. Second, serum estradiol and testosterone levels had little association with cognitive function in women. Among men, higher testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency overall, and most strongly among APOE-e4 carriers, and higher levels were more generally associated with relatively better cognitive functioning among those classified with cognitive impairment. Third, random assignment to the 10-year intensive lifestyle intervention resulted in a legacy of a modest decrement in cognitive functions in women (but not men), however the magnitude of this was not related to their current levels of estradiol or testosterone. We note that the Look AHEAD intervention resulted in many long-term benefits on outcomes such as diabetes control and complications, depression, physical health-related quality of life, sleep apnea, incontinence, brain structure, health care use and costs, multimorbidity, geriatric syndromes, and disability-free life years.26

4.1. Associations with BMI

As noted in the introduction, it is well established that in older women, greater BMI is associated with higher levels of estradiol and testosterone, and in older men, greater BMI is associated with higher levels of estradiol, but lower testosterone levels.2–29 Observing these associations in the Look AHEAD cohort was expected. Even moderate weight loss through lifestyle intervention in women is known to decrease estradiol and testosterone levels, and in men to decrease estradiol levels and increase testosterone levels.30,31 Surgical treatments of obesity result in even greater changes.32,33 In our cohort, changes in BMI from baseline were modestly related to current estradiol and testosterone levels in women, but not in men. The differences in mean BMI between intervention groups (≤1 kg/m2) appear to have been too small to have resulted in differences in sex hormone levels. The greater weight changes observed during the delivery of the Look AHEAD intervention did not appear to leave a legacy of altered sex hormone levels.

4.2. Associations between sex hormones and cognitive function

Most prior studies report little association between levels of endogenous estradiol and cognitive function in general cohorts of older women.34–36 We found this to hold true among the Look AHEAD women, i.e. T2DM did not appear to put women with relatively higher estradiol levels at risk for cognitive deficits. A major limitation in our analyses was that estradiol levels for most women were below the detectable level of our assay, and thus we cannot draw any conclusions about associations across most of the distribution. The Three-City study divided estradiol levels into quartiles, with the 75 % percentile used to demarcate relatively higher levels of estradiol being 8–9 pg/ml,3 which is well below our 20 pg/ml threshold (i.e., the approximate lower bound of the upper quartile of our distribution): thus, it is possible that we may have missed important associations. We conducted supporting analyses using the detectable levels of estradiol as a continuous measure in the subset of women for which they were available, but found no evidence of graded associations with cognitive function.

It remains a caution, however, consistent with the healthy cell bias theory, that initiation or re-initiation of postmenopausal hormone therapy late after menopause (i.e. age ≥ 65 years) in women with T2DM increases risks for cognitive decline and dementia based on large well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials.4–6

While there have been some reports that higher levels of testosterone in older women may be linked to poorer cognitive function,12 others have found little or no association.36–38

Among older men, there have been some reports that higher levels of estradiol are associated with better cognitive functioning,36,38 but others, like our present study, have found little or no association.34

The strongest evidence for associations between sex hormones and cognitive function in our study was for higher levels of testosterone being modestly associated with better verbal fluency in men. At least one other study of older men has reported that higher testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency, but were not associated with performance in other cognitive domains.39 Literature reviews find little overall evidence of associations more broadly.40,41 The recent T-Trials of testosterone therapy found it had no overall impact on cognitive functioning, but did not include a test of verbal fluency.42 Separately, however, there is evidence that low testosterone levels increase risks for Alzheimer’s disease.43

We have modest evidence that associations between testosterone and verbal fluency in men may vary depending on APOE-e4 status, i.e. that higher total testosterone levels may protect verbal fluency among men who are APOE-ed carriers, but less so among non carriers. Others have reported similar interactions for men, but in other cognitive domains. In a large cohort of older men free of diabetes, greater levels of free testosterone were associated with better global cognitive functioning among APOE-e4 carriers, but not non-carriers.44 In a cohort of middle-aged men (mean 56 years), free testosterone (from saliva) was positively related to a measures of logical recall only among APOE-e4 carriers.45 In addition, testosterone therapy protects against APOE-e4 related cognitive deficits in male mice.46 However, others have found no evidence of positive effects among male APOE-e4 carriers.47

The evidence we provide that higher testosterone levels were associated with relatively better cognitive functioning in men with cognitive impairment was not a pre-specified aim of our analysis and may be a chance finding. However, there is some evidence that testosterone may mitigate some of the harm associated with cognitive impairment. Among men with mild cognitive impairment, greater testosterone levels are associated with lower β-amyloid levels through increased clearance48–50 and perhaps by reducing mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress.50 However, there is no evidence that testosterone therapy improves cognitive function in men with cognitive deficits.42 There was less evidence that higher testosterone levels were associated with better cognitive functioning in women with cognitive impairment compared with those with no impairment, however the trends for composite cognitive functioning bore some resemblance to those for men.

4.3. Long-term effects of intensive lifestyle intervention on cognitive function

This is the first report front Look AHEAD that ILI may have a legacy of small relative cognitive deficits in women, but not men. Overall, women maintained better cognitive functioning and less cognitive impairment than men in prior analyses17 and in our current cohort, so that this may reflect a loss of sex-related protection over time. There is some evidence that obesity is protective against accelerated brain aging in women, but not in men,51 so that the long-term increased relative weight losses seen in the Look AHEAD ILI group may have resulted in small cognitive deficits. Another potential explanation is differential attrition, i.e. that men experiencing greater losses of cognitive functioning may have dropped from the study. We have previously conducted an inverse probability weighting analyses to gauge the likelihood of this, but found no evidence to support this speculation.17 Whatever the underlying mechanism for these sex-related differences in cognitive functioning, they do not appear to be linked to sex hormones and remain a quandary for us, although it should be noted that women and men differed with respect to demographic factors linked to cognitive deficits.

4.4. Strengths and limitations

Our study benefits from a well characterized cohort and standardized cognitive assessments. As volunteers for a clinical trial of a behavioral intervention, the cohort may not reflect general populations. Our estradiol assay was not sufficiently sensitive to low levels so that most women were reported as below the detectable threshold, which is commonly reported in other studies using the radioimmunoassay for estradiol.52 These undetectable estradiol levels hamper our ability to characterize associations between estradiol and cognition in women and is a major limitation. We conducted separate analyses limited to participants with detectable estradiol levels, which yielded similar null results. While some have reported associations between sex hormones and cognition to be curvelinear,11 we used linear regression throughout, which while justified on the basis of scatterplots and additional modeling, may not fully capture relationships. We repeated analyses using scores from individual cognitive tests, rather than combining them to create domains: results from this did not differ materially from what we have presented and are not shown. We also examined whether the ratio of testosterone to estradiol, a risk factor for stroke in men,53 might have stronger associations than the individual hormone levels, but did not find evidence of this. Our analyses are post hoc and exploratory and we have not controlled for multiple comparisons.

5. Conclusions

In a cohort of older individuals with T2DM, we found no evidence that endogenous estradiol and testosterone levels were related to cognitive functioning in women. Higher testosterone levels were associated with better verbal fluency in men, but not women, most strongly among APOE-e4 carriers. A 10-year behavioral weight loss intervention left a legacy of modestly lower cognitive function in women, however this was unrelated to current levels of estradiol and testosterone.
