Aims:

We sought to replicate findings from published genome-wide association studies, linking specific candidate gene loci with periodontitis-related clinical/microbial traits.

Methods:

In the published GWAS, a total of 2,196 SNPs associated with periodontitis-related traits at a p≤5×10−6 and mapped to 136 gene loci. The replication cohort included 1,124 individuals, 65–98 years old (67% female, 45% Hispanic, 30% Black, 23% White) with available genome-wide genotypes and full-mouth periodontal status. Microbial profiles using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization and 16SrRNA sequencing were available from 912 and 739 participants, respectively.

Findings:

Using gene-specific p-values after linkage disequilibrium pruning, the following gene/phenotype associations replicated successfully: CLEC19A with edentulism and %teeth with PD≥4mm; IL37, HPVC1, TRPS1, ABHD12B, LDLRAD4, TGM3, GRK5 with %teeth with PD≥4mm; DAB2IP with presence of PD≥6mm; KIAA1715(LNPK), ROBO2, RAB28, LINC01017, NELL1, LDLRAD4(C18orF1), CRYBB2P1 with %teeth with CAL≥3 mm; RUNX2, LAMA2 with %teeth with CAL≥5 mm; and KIAA1715(LNPK) with high colonization by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, CLEC19A, IQSEC1 and EMR1 associated with microbial abundance based on checkerboard data, LBP and NCR2 with abundance based on sequencing data, and NCR2 with microbial diversity based on sequencing data.

Conclusions:

Several gene loci identified in published GWAS as associated with periodontitis-related phenotypes replicated successfully in an elderly cohort.

pmcINTRODUCTION

According to our current understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontitis, the disease ensues as a result of disruption in the homeostasis between the oral microbial community and the innate host defenses (Darveau, 2010; Van Dyke, et al., 2020). Dysbiotic shifts in periodontal microbial communities along with perturbations of the host immunoregulatory networks are thought to create a reciprocal feedback loop of chronic inflammation and immune-mediated tissue destruction, resulting in pocket formation and loss of periodontal tissue support (Hajishengallis, 2015; Kinane, et al., 2017).

Despite significant research advances, the processes governing the transition from periodontal health to gingivitis to destructive periodontitis are incompletely understood. While the presence of bacterial plaque is necessary for the onset of inflammation (Löe, et al., 1965), it is clearly not sufficient for causing periodontitis, and the periodontal bacterial load does not correlate consistently with disease severity or progression (Löe, et al., 1986). Genetic predispositions and epigenetic elements, environmental exposures, and a number of systemic conditions are all thought to contribute to the disease development (Lalla, et al., 2011; Barros, et al., 2014; Kinane, et al., 2017; Loos, et al., 2020).

Genetic influences on the host susceptibility to periodontitis have been documented in findings from twin- (Michalowicz, et al., 1991) and family studies (Saxén, 1980; Marazita, et al., 1994) which led to heritability estimates of periodontitis of up to 50% (Michalowicz, et al., 2000). However, a recent systematic review (Nibali, et al., 2019) reported substantially lower heritability estimates: 38% in twin studies, 15% in other family studies, and only 7% in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

To date, a ‘hypothesis-free’ approach to identify genetic loci associated with periodontitis has been adopted by a limited number of GWAS. Of these, eight studies involved European population samples (Schaefer, et al., 2010; Teumer, et al., 2013; Freitag-Wolf, et al., 2014; Munz, et al., 2017; Bevilacqua, et al., 2018; Freitag-Wolf, et al., 2019; Munz, et al., 2019; de Coo, et al., 2021), three examined Asian population samples (Hong, et al., 2015; Shimizu, et al., 2015; Tong, et al., 2019), and four GWAS involved population samples from the Americas (Divaris, et al., 2013; Feng, et al., 2014; Shaffer, et al., 2014; Sanders, et al., 2017). However, a recent meta-analysis of their findings (Shungin, et al., 2019) demonstrated only limited concordance among them, which can be attributable to inadequate sample size of the individual studies, inherent genetic differences between the populations, but also to inconsistencies in the precise definition of periodontitis “cases” and “controls” across studies. In addition, three publications (Divaris, et al., 2012; Rhodin, et al., 2014; Offenbacher, et al., 2016), all stemming from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study in the US and using the “checkerboard” DNA-DNA hybridization technique (Socransky, et al., 1994) to analyze the microbial content of subgingival plaque samples, have investigated SNPs associated with distinct periodontal microbial colonization patterns (“periodontal microbial traits”).

Notably, several GWAS involved samples of young age aiming at the identification of SNPs associated with the relatively rare phenotype of “early-onset” periodontitis. There is significant concern that the “control” subjects in these studies, i.e., participants who at the time of examination were free of periodontitis or presented with only mild signs, may have been misclassified, as they could conceivably develop periodontitis later in life, given that both the prevalence and the severity of the more common form of the disease increase with age (Papapanou, et al., 2017; Billings, et al., 2018). Therefore, it may be argued that the external validity of SNPs associated with all forms of periodontitis should ideally be tested in independent population samples of elderly individuals with fully developed periodontitis-related phenotypes, similarly to the approach adopted in replication studies focusing on other complex diseases, such as type II diabetes (Horikawa, et al., 2008; Tabara, et al., 2009). In this study, we sought to replicate the findings of the published GWAS in the Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) Ancillary Study of Oral Health that included participants who were ≥65 years old at the time of their oral examination. Specifically, we carried out gene-centric analyses with respect to multiple clinical phenotypes broadly associated with periodontitis including edentulism and a number of periodontal microbial colonization traits.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

WHICAP Ancillary Study of Oral Health

Over more than 30 years, WHICAP has serially assessed approximately 6,000 participants over the age of 65 years with respect to medical, social, and health behavior histories, general medical exams, and neuropsychological testing (Tang, et al., 2001). The WHICAP Ancillary Study of Oral Health is a cross-sectional cohort study that recruited 1,130 individuals among the parent study participants and was conducted between December 2013 and June 2016 (Shariff, et al., 2018). The Institutional Review Board of the Columbia University Irving Medical Center approved the study design and procedures. Table 1 lists selected demographic characteristics and dental status of the sub-sample of 1,124 participants who were clinically examined and from whom genotyping data were available. These had a mean age of 75.5 years (SD 6.6 years, range 60–98), and were 67% female, 45% Hispanic, 30% Black and 23% white. The proportion of fully edentulous participants was 14%.

Periodontal clinical examination and clinical phenotypes

Dentate participants underwent full-mouth assessments of pocket depth (PD) and clinical attachment level using a UNC-15 manual periodontal probe at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, disto-lingual, mid-lingual and mesio-lingual) at all present teeth, excluding third molars, by a single calibrated dental examiner. The following clinical phenotypes were computed based on the clinical data: (i) edentulism (171 participants; 15%); (ii) number of teeth present/participant; (iii) CDC/AAP periodontitis classes (Eke, et al., 2012), i.e., no (N=170; 19.7%), mild (N=24; 2.8%), moderate (N=469; 54.5%), severe periodontitis (N=198; 23.0%); % of teeth/participant with PD≥4mm; presence of teeth with PD≥6mm (N=265; 29.2%); and % of teeth/participant with CAL≥3mm or with CAL≥5 mm.

Assessments of periodontal microbiota and bacterial phenotypes

From all dentate participants, four individual subgingival plaque samples, each from the mesio-lingual surface of the most posterior tooth in each quadrant were obtained prior to the probing examination, and the association of microbial profiles to the clinical periodontal status was reported (Papapanou, et al., 2020). One half of each individual plaque sample was used to generate a single pooled sample per participant that was processed by means of Human Oral Microbe Identification using Next Generation Sequencing (HOMINGS (Caporaso, et al., 2011)). The other half was processed individually using whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method (Socransky, et al., 1994). The association between periodontal bacterial profiles and clinical periodontal status in this cohort has been recently published (Papapanou, et al., 2020).

Based on checkerboard data, the following four, previously defined microbial traits (Divaris, et al., 2013; Rhodin, et al., 2014) were analyzed: (i) high colonization (upper 10th percentile) by Porphyromonas gingivalis; (ii) high colonization by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; (iii) high colonization by “red complex” species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola) and (iv) high colonization by selected “orange complex” species (Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra and Campylobacter rectus).

In addition, hierarchical clustering was used to segregate participants into four groups with maximum intra-cluster similarity and maximum inter-cluster difference. Hierarchical clustering using the Ward method based on the Euclidean distance was carried out in R version 4.0.2 on the basis of three alternative approaches: (i) microbial abundance using checkerboard data, (ii) microbial abundance using sequencing data, and (iii) microbial alpha-diversity using sequencing data.

Genotyping and associated analyses

As part of the parent WHICAP study, genome-wide genotypes were available, derived using the Illumina Omni-1 Quad bead chip (Lee, et al., 2011). Participant samples were randomly plated independent of periodontal status, which was unknown at the time of processing, precluding bias. Genome-wide imputation of allele dosages was performed using the worldwide reference panel (v3, released March 2012) for imputation of genotypes from 1000 Genomes (build 37, http://www.1000genomes.org/announcements/updated-integrated-phase-1-release-calls-2012-03-16) and the IMPUTE2 (http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute_v2.html) software, applying strict pre-phasing, pre-imputation filtering, and variant position and strand alignment control. Only imputed SNP dosages with an imputation quality estimate of R2 ≥0.50 were included in the final SNP set for analysis of candidate genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) less than 0.01, call rates less than 98%, or not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P&lt;10−6 in controls) were excluded. Participants whose reported sex differed from the sex assignment determined by analysis of the X-chromosome SNPs using PLINK (Purcell, et al., 2007) were excluded as well. Latent relatedness among participants was identified by the estimated proportion of alleles (π) shared identically by descent (IBD) using PLINK. One participant from each duplicate pair (π &gt; 0.95) or relative pair (0.4≤π&lt;0.95) was included in the sample used for association analyses, prioritizing on the basis on non-missing periodontal status and subsequently on higher SNP call rate. Population substructure was evaluated using EIGENSTRAT (http://genepath.med.harvard.edu/%7Ereich/EIGENSTRAT.html). First, separately for each ethnic group (non-Hispanic White, African American, Hispanic), genetic profiles for all participants were compared with those in the respective 1000Genomes reference panels, and outliers with respect to ancestry were removed. Then, the data were re-evaluated using EIGENSTRAT to derive loadings for the first 10 principal components. The resulting information was used in the association analyses to adjust for population substructure.

Analyses were restricted to candidate SNPs derived by using all loci that were identified as associated with clinical or microbial periodontitis-associated traits at p≤5×10−6 and verified with a custom Python Script (Python 3.7.4) in the 19 publications mentioned in the introduction. Gene boundaries in GRCh37 coordinates were determined employing Ensembl (https://useast.ensembl.org/). A total of 2,196 SNPs were examined mapping to 136 gene loci.

The lead SNPs identified in the above publications along with the genes associated with these SNPs are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Table 2 lists gene loci associated with clinical phenotypes (panel A), and “periodontal microbial traits” (panel B) reported in the 19 published GWAS.

In the replication analyses, the p-value for statistical significance of SNPs associated with each of the 136 gene loci was determined after variance inflation factor (VIF)-based linkage disequilibrium pruning, setting the VIF at 2, followed by correction for the number of independent tests performed per gene (Iglesias, et al., 2018; Choquet, et al., 2021). Separately for each ethnic group, generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses were performed individually relating the particular SNPs with each individual phenotype defined above, adjusting for sex, age, and population stratification. In these analyses, associations were assessed and dichotomized for variables of edentulism, the CDC/AAP classification [coded as 0 (non/mild) or 1 (moderate/severe)], presence/absence of teeth with PD≥6 mm, and the microbial traits described above. Subsequently, associations were tested using continuous measures of pocketing and attachment loss (i.e., % of teeth with PD≥4mm, and percent of teeth with CAL≥3 mm or ≥ 5mm (Holtfreter, et al., 2015)). The results from these ethnicity-specific analyses were then meta-analyzed using MANTRA (Morris, 2011) which has been specifically developed to allow for trans-ethnic meta-analysis of genetic association data and takes into account the expected similarity in allelic effects between the most closely related populations, while allowing for heterogeneity between more diverse ethnic groups. This approach yields substantial improvements in performance compared to fixed effects meta-analysis, both in terms of power to detect associations and localization of the causal variant, over a range of models of heterogeneity between ethnic groups. Furthermore, when the similarity in allelic effects between populations is well captured by their relatedness, this approach offers increased power and mapping resolution over random effects meta-analysis.

RESULTS

Replication of Genes Associated with Periodontal Phenotypes

Table 3a shows the results of the replication analysis with respect to periodontitis-related clinical phenotypes. The Table lists the lead SNP per haplotype that met the replication p-value. A single gene was found to be statistically significantly associated with edentulism (CLEC19A), while no genes were found to be associated with either the number of teeth present or the CDC/AAP classes. Seven genes (KIAA1715 (LNPK), ROBO2, RAB28, LINC01017, NELL1, LDLRAD4 (C180rF1), CRYBB2P1) were found to be statistically significantly associated with the % of teeth with CAL≥3mm and two genes (RUNX2, LAMA2) with the % of teeth with CAL≥5mm. Eight genes were statistically significantly associated with % of teeth with PD≥4mm (IL37, HPVC1, TRPS1, ABHD12B, CLEC19A, LDLRAD4 (C18orF1), TGM3, GRK5) and a single gene (DAB2IP) with the dichotomous presence/absence of PD ≥6mm.

Table 3b shows the findings of the replication analyses associated with the previously described “periodontal microbial traits”, all defined in an identical manner as in the publication by (Divaris, et al., 2012). A total of 912 participants with available genotypes and periodontal microbial data generated through checkerboard hybridizations were available for these analyses. Only a single gene (KIAA1715 (LNPK)) was replicated as associated statistically significantly with the “high A. actinomycetemcomitans trait”, but no genes emerged as associated with the “high P. gingivalis trait”, the “high red complex trait”, or the “high orange complex trait”.

Table 4 presents the results of the replication analysis with respect to the additional periodontal microbial traits, generated by hierarchical clustering using data derived by checkerboard hybridizations or 16S rRNA sequencing. The number of study participants involved in these analyses and their distribution into the emerging clusters are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Five genes in total (CLEC19A, EMR1, IQSEC1, LBP, NCR2) emerged as statistically significantly associated with at least one of these novel microbial traits. A complete list of all SNPs that replicated in association with the clinical and microbial traits examined is presented in Supplementary Table 3.

Lastly, Supplementary Table 4 presents a cross-tabulation of the number of SNPs mapping to each of the 21 replicated genes by periodontitis-related phenotype. A total of 22 SNPs, mapping to NELL1 (Fig. 1), 14 SNPs mapping to ROBO2 (Fig. 2), and 14 SNPs mapping to CRYBB2P1 (Fig. 3) met the replication threshold and associated with % of teeth with CAL≥3mm. Locus Zoom plots for the remaining 18 genes that successfully replicated are illustrated in Supplementary Figures 1–18. For all analyses, the identified haplotypes differed from previously reported GWAS lead SNPs, in line with the notion that there are more than one causative SNPs in these genes.

DISCUSSION

In the present work, we carried out a gene-centric replication of loci associated with various periodontitis-related clinical and microbial traits at a suggestive threshold of statistical significance (p≤5×10−6) in the GWAS available to date. In a replication cohort consisting of 1,124 individuals over the age of 65 years, we attempted to externally validate the association of 136 gene loci that mapped to a total of 2,196 individual SNPs. Although none of the published SNPs replicated in our study in any instance, we successfully replicated several associations on the gene locus level after correction for multiple testing. Specifically, (i) 21 of 136 gene loci examined were identified as statistically significantly associated with any of the analyzed traits; (ii) four genes [CLEC19A, KIAA1715 (LNPK), LDLRAD4 and NCR2] were associated with more than one traits, and (iii) one gene [KIAA1715 (LNPK)] replicated in association with the originally described phenotype (i.e., the “high A. actinomycetemcomitans trait”). Our work significantly expands the number of externally validated gene loci associated with periodontitis-related phenotypes; the roles of these genes in the pathobiology of periodontitis should be investigated in further studies.

We emphasize that the age of the participants in the replication cohort, along with the detailed assessment of periodontal status (probing depth and attachment loss measurements at 6 sites per tooth at all present teeth), drastically reduce the risk for misclassification bias in the ascertainment of periodontal status and are significant strengths of our study. Given that periodontitis is a complex disease with multiple SNPs of mostly small effect size expected to contribute to a person’s susceptibility, our gene-centric focus in this replication analysis is reasonable, as it increases the power to detect signals despite a relatively limited sample size. We set the appropriate replication p-value for each gene individually, after factoring in the reported linkage disequilibrium rates of the individual SNPs. This approach is significantly more conservative than the “nominal p-value threshold” approach commonly applied to candidate gene studies (Marigorta, et al., 2018). Importantly, we examined an array of phenotypes broadly related to periodontitis, including edentulism, number of teeth present, continuous variables and categorical classes reflecting periodontitis extent and severity commonly used in the literature, as well as a number of periodontal microbial colonization patterns, including previously described traits and novel ones that are specific to the replication cohort. We did not restrict the replication analyses to narrowly examine only the specific gene-phenotype associations originally described, but rather examined the potential association of every previously identified gene with any of the analyzed traits. Admittedly, a limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size, which precluded us from carrying out a GWAS, or from replicating small-effect, low minor allele frequency SNPs, in particular in analyses of subgroups. In addition, our cohort included a thri-ethnic population whose genetic determinants of periodontitis may have been different from those in the published GWAS.

A single gene (CLEC19A; C-type lectin domain family 19 member A) was found to be associated with more than two traits in our analyses, namely with two clinical phenotypes (edentulism and percentage of teeth with PD≥ 4mm) as well as with a novel endo-phenotype related to microbial abundance derived from checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization data. This gene codes for a membrane-tethered or secreted protein which is involved in carbohydrate recognition and is a member of the C-lectin receptor protein family. In the context of periodontitis, SNPs mapping to CLEC19A were identified as associated with a “periodontal complex trait” characterized by a uniformly high pathogen load, in an analysis involving participants of the dental ARIC study and a sample of aggressive periodontitis patients and periodontally health controls from Germany (Offenbacher, et al., 2016). Interestingly, CLEC19A was recently reported in a genome-wide study of pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer’s disease to be significantly associated with the accumulation of neurofibrillary tau tangles (Wang, et al., 2020), adding to the literature suggesting a possible association between periodontitis, periodontal microbial dysbiosis and cognitive dysfunction (Noble, et al., 2009; Noble, et al., 2014; Dominy, et al., 2019; Kamer, et al., 2021).

Only three additional genes [KIAA1517(LNPK), LDLRAD4 and NCR2] associated with two phenotypes in WHICAP. KIAA1715 (LNPK) encodes a transmembrane protein that regulates the shape of the endoplasmic reticulum (Chen, et al., 2012) and is ubiquitously present in human adult brain tissues. Homologous loss-of-function mutations in LNPK were shown to be associated with severe psychomotor delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy and corpus callosum hypoplasia in children (Breuss, et al., 2018). In our replication analyses, LNPK associated with the percentage of teeth with CAL≥3mm but also with high periodontal colonization by A. actinomycetemcomitans, making it the sole gene that replicated its association with the originally identified phenotype (Divaris, et al., 2012).

The second gene, LDLRAD4 (low density lipoprotein receptor class A domain containing 4) is a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling (Nakano, et al., 2014), and has pleiotropic effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, extracellular matrix production and immunosuppression. It emerged as significantly associated with the percentage of teeth with CAL≥3 mm and the percentage of teeth with PD≥4mm, but was originally identified as associated with a diagnosis of severe periodontitis according to the CDC/AAP classification in a Korean population (Hong, et al., 2015). Interestingly, periodontal infection of LDLRAD4 KO mice with P. gingivalis was associated with an elevation of circulatory LDL-cholesterol levels (Miyauchi, et al., 2012). An association between periodontitis and dyslipidemia has been reported (Gomes-Filho, et al., 2021), along with an association of dyslipidemia with low socioeconomic status, racial and ethnic disparities (Kenik, et al., 2014).

The third gene that associated with two phenotypes was NCR2 (Natural Cytotoxicity Trigerring Receptor 2), a protein coding gene that contributes to the efficiency of activated natural killer (NK) cells to induce tumor lysis (Cantoni, et al., 1999). Originally described in the context of periodontitis GWAS as associated with CDC/AAP “moderate periodontitis” (Divaris, et al., 2013), it was found in WHICAP to associate with two novel microbial traits derived from microbial sequencing data (abundance-based clustering, and alpha-diversity based clustering).

Two clinical traits were associated with most replicated genes: one reflected extent of pocketing (%teeth/person with PD≥4mm) and associated with 8 genes, while the other reflected extent of loss of periodontal tissue support (%teeth/person with CAL≥3mm) and associated with 7 genes. Among these 15 genes, only one [LDLRAD4 (C180rf1)] was shared between the two traits. Notably, none of the investigated genes successfully replicated as associated with the CDC/AAP classification in the WHICAP cohort.

Lastly, three genes earlier reported to be associated periodontitis, i.e., NELL1 (Sanders, et al., 2017), CRYBB2P1 (Freitag-Wolf, et al., 2019) and ROBO2 (Teumer, et al., 2013; Richter, et al., 2021) replicated by virtue of multiple SNPs meeting the p-value threshold, indicating a higher degree of confidence in their validation. Indeed, 22 individual SNPs within the NELL1 locus, and 14 SNPs within each of the CRYBBB2P1 and ROBO2 loci emerged as significantly associated with the % of teeth with CAL ≥3 mm.

To fully disentangle the genetic heritability of periodontitis, genomic studies with sufficient sample size need to be carried out to detect small effect sizes or associations with rare variants, informed by genetic ancestry, and ideally coupled with additional multi-omic approaches to further examine causality and underlying molecular pathways. To ultimately translate these findings into the development of a genetic test for periodontitis, externally replicated SNPs need to be validated experimentally, and their roles in the pathobiology of the disease must be appreciated. Polygenic risk scores whose performance is independently validated across racial/ethnic groups and individuals with varying risk profiles need to be developed. Until analytic validity (i.e., ability to accurately assess the genotype of interest), clinical validity (i.e., ability to accurately predict the associated disorder), and clinical utility (i.e., a broad-based evaluation of the risks and benefits associated with the introduction of a genetic test into routine practice are convincingly demonstrated (Marzuillo, et al., 2014), breakthroughs in the detection or management of periodontitis through genetic or genomic advances remain elusive.

CLINICAL RELEVANCE

Scientific rationale for the study:

Published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with various periodontitis-related traits in different populations. We sought to replicate, in a tri-ethnic cohort of elderly individuals with fully developed periodontitis-related traits, the association of all genes collectively identified by the available GWAS with several previously described or novel clinical and microbial periodontitis-related traits.

Principal Findings:

Twenty one of the 136 examined genes emerged as statistically significantly associated with any of the analyzed phenotypes. One gene associated with three phenotypes, and four genes with two phenotypes each.

Practical implications:

Our findings significantly expand the number of externally validated periodontitis-associated gene loci that can be studied further.

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
