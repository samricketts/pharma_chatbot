Background:

American Indians have high prevalence of risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) compared to the general population, yet dementia onset and frequency in this population are understudied. Intraindividual cognitive variability (IICV), a measure of variability in neuropsychological test performance within a person at a single timepoint, may be a novel, noninvasive biomarker of neurodegeneration and early dementia.

Objective:

To characterize the cross-sectional associations between IICV and hippocampal, total brain volume, and white matter disease measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among older American Indians.

Methods:

IICV measures for memory, executive function and processing speed, and multidomain cognition were calculated for 746 American Indians (aged 64–95) who underwent MRI. Regression models were used to examine the associations of IICV score with hippocampal volume, total brain volume, and graded white matter disease, adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, intracranial volume, diabetes, stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol use and smoking.

Results:

Higher memory IICV measure was associated with lower hippocampal volume (Beta= −0.076; 95%CI −0.499, −0.023; p=0.031). After adjustment for Bonferroni or IICV mean scores in the same tests, the associations were no longer significant. No IICV measures were associated with white matter disease or total brain volume.

Conclusion:

These findings suggest that the IICV measures used in this research cannot be robustly associated with cross-sectional neuroimaging features, nonetheless the results encourage future studies investigating the associations between IICV and other brain regions, as well as its utility in the prediction of neurodegeneration and dementia in American Indians.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a growing burden to public health worldwide [1]. Dementia is characterized by an irreversible, progressive, neuropsychiatric condition that affects the individual’s cognition and function [2] and can result in costly long-term care [3]. Although advanced age is the strongest single risk predictor of developing dementia [4], vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and high cholesterol, are also associated with higher risk of cognitive impairment and ADRD in the general population [5, 6]. Neurological permutations of vascular disease, such as white matter hyperintensities, infarcts, and hemorrhages, may accelerate ADRD-related pathogenesis and frequently coexist in mixed forms of dementia [7]. As many as 50% of Alzheimer’s disease patients also present with vascular brain injury [8, 9]. American Indians, an underrepresented population in ADRD research, have higher risks of vascular brain injury [10–12], stroke [13], diabetes mellitus [14] compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Some polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E (APOE), and particularly the presence of the APOE ε4 allele, have been reported to be associated with memory and other cognitive dysfunction and increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease in the general population [15], however, no association with cognitive or imaging features has been detected with APOE in American Indians [16]. American Indians and Alaska Native aged 65 and over are a growing population in the United States, representing 0.6% of the total elderly population in 2019, and this number is project to be 0.7% by 2060 [17]. There is limited literature on the incidence of dementia in American Indians. However, lack of adequate measures to assess cognitive and functional impairments as well as elevated rates of mortality after initial diagnosis have been reported in indigenous populations when compared to other ethnic and racial groups [18]. With increasing health disparities [19], American Indians are now affected by more adverse health conditions, many of which are considered risk factors for ADRD, thus increasing their vulnerability to dementia.

Neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures that help predict and diagnose dementia are important research and clinical tools. Indeed, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicators of vascular brain injury and hippocampal volume have been shown to be sensitive markers of cognitive decline in the general population [20, 21]. Moreover, recent data from American Indian populations has indicated an association between larger left hippocampal volume and higher scores on measures of verbal recall [22], worse processing speed performance and the presence of infarcts, white matter disease, lower hippocampal volume and lower total brain volume, as well as an association between better general cognition and higher hippocampal volume [23].

Research has demonstrated that cross-sectional intraindividual cognitive variability (IICV), the within-person standard deviation across cognitive tests/tasks at a single time point, or dispersion in cognitive performance,, may be a sensitive cognitive marker of early cognitive impairment related to dementia for the general population [24–27]. Moreover, IICV indicates neurological damage and may be associated with network dysfunction resulting from neurodegenerative processes [27, 28]. Higher IICV has been associated with poor cognitive function in cross-sectional studies and with the subsequent development of dementia in older adults [25, 29–35]. Furthermore, studies on IICV suggest that higher within-visit variability may reflect dysfunction in attention and memory control systems [27, 36]. IICV at a single timepoint may also correlate with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s dementia [26]. In the general population, higher IICV at a single timepoint has been associated with greater amyloid-β burden [25] and structural losses, including cerebral white matter alterations [37], damage in the frontal cortices [38], and regional brain atrophy [24, 39]. Several studies also suggest a link between IICV and cognitive decline [24–26, 31–35, 37, 39, 40]. However, few studies have investigated IICV in racial/ethnic minority populations, which often have differential item functioning on standard cognitive tests. It is unknown whether neuroimaging measures related to vascular brain injury and cerebral atrophy may be associated with IICV in American Indians.

Individuals from Indigenous populations, many of whom live in rural communities with limited resources, may exhibit more resistance to invasive testing, such as lumbar puncture and positron emission tomography scan [41]. Although IICV could offer a low-cost and noninvasive marker of early-stage Alzheimer’s disease, compared to specialized imaging equipment biomarkers [31, 39, 40], it has not yet been investigated in American Indians. Evaluating the relationship between measures of neurodegeneration and cognitive predictive measures in older American Indians is critical for identifying individuals at greatest risk of developing dementia and to develop effective interventions to mitigate the impact of ADRD.

The aim of this study was to characterize the cross-sectional relationships between IICV across different tests and cognitive domains with hippocampal, total brain volume, and white matter disease in American Indians. We expected that higher IICV would be related to lower hippocampal and total brain volumes and more white matter disease measured by MRI. More specifically, given the known involvement of the hippocampus in mnemonic processes [42, 43], we hypothesized that higher memory IICV would be associated with lower hippocampal volume. In addition, based on established relationships between processing speed, executive function, white matter disease, and vascular risk factors [23, 44]; we hypothesized that higher executive function and processing speed IICV would be associated with more white matter disease. Finally, based on previous studies showing an association between total brain volume and mean global cognition [45, 46], we hypothesized that higher multidomain IICV would be associated with lower total brain volume.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Setting

Study Ethics

This study involved secondary analyses of data from the Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians (CDCAI) Study [47]. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and all study procedures were approved by the appropriate institutional review boards, Tribal Research Review Boards, and/or Tribal Councils.

CDCAI Study

The CDCAI Study is an ancillary study of the Strong Heart Study[48], the largest study of American Indian adults with neuropsychological and neuroimaging measures collected to date. The main aim of the study was to estimate prevalence of vascular brain injury by MRI among American Indians. The first data collection visit for the CDCAI took place from 2010–2013 and included residents of communities affiliated with three geographically diverse areas called field centers, U.S. Northern Plains, Southern Plains, and Southwest, represented respectively by the study centers: North Dakota, Oklahoma and Arizona), representing 11 of the 13 original Strong Heart Study communities [48]. Participants were excluded if they had (1) prior surgery for a cerebral aneurysm; (2) an implanted cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or artificial heart; (3) contraindicating metal prostheses; (4) a cochlear implant, spinal cord stimulator, or other internal electrical device; (4) a history of employment as a metal worker (given the possibility of retained metal fragments, especially near the eyes); (5) a weight of ≥ 350 pounds; or (6) the physical or cognitive inability to complete study procedures [47]. Of the 1033 originally participants, one community chose to withdraw, and so 209 participants were later removed, and 817 remained available for analysis.

Study Sample

Participants underwent 1.5 Tesla cranial MRI exams and completed neuropsychological testing. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires for sociodemographic data.

Because the goal of this study was to investigate the association between IICV and MRI findings related to vascular and early neurodegenerative injury, 44 individuals with moderate or severe cognitive impairment were excluded based on a cutoff of &lt;70 points on the Modified Mini Mental State Test (3MS) [49]. Given that we do not have dementia diagnosis, the rationale behind removing these individuals is to avoid including those who may have had more advanced cognitive impairment and already reached a threshold of cognitive deficit across test scores resulting in diminished cognitive variability. In the 3MS, higher scores indicate better cognitive performance. The cutoff did not consider educational level, age or sex. We chose a conservative cutoff because American Indian normative data are not available for the 3MS. However, studies of the 3MS in non-Hispanic Whites identified a cutoff for dementia between 76–80 points [50–52], and a study including community dwelling non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans and Hispanic/Latinos showed that scores &lt;75 are uncommon [53]. During our preliminary analysis of the distribution of the 3MS by the measures of cognitive variability from our study, we found that participants scoring &lt; 70 on the 3MS demonstrated little variability, providing justification for this threshold as an exclusion criterion. We also excluded 27 participants who did not complete at least one of the neuropsychological tests or did not complete their MRIs. This resulting final sample size of 746 American Indian older adults was used in our primary analysis.

Data Collection

Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Data on the MRI scans and neuropsychological assessments have been fully described elsewhere [47]. In brief, MRI scanning was performed on two different scanners (Siemens 1.5T Symphony and General Electric 1.5T Signa) available at the regional hospitals. Scan protocols were optimized for interpretation, analysis, compatibility with the level of technology, consistency across study sites and scanners and compatibility with study procedures used by previous cohort studies. A contrast agent was not used. The processing and interpretation of images by neurologists included graded severity of white matter hyperintensities using standard image templates [11], with grades ranging from 0 (normal) to 9 (most abnormal), along with measures of volumetric intracranial space, total brain (gray and white matter) volume, and hippocampal volume. Image processing and interpretation by neurologists included quantitative volumes estimated using automated software: FLEX for WMH [54], FIRST in FSL 5.0 (ENIGMA1 protocol) for the hippocampus [55–57], and FreeSurfer for total brain (white and gray matter) and intracranial space [58]. Pulse sequences were similar to those used by two existing cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and the Cardiovascular Health Study, in order to allow comparability. Six sequences were obtained in contiguous slices: 1) sagittal T1-weighted localizer, 2) co-registered 5mm axial-T1, 3) 5 mm axial-T2, and 4) 5mm axial-T2* susceptibility-weighted images in the anterior commissure/posterior commissure plane, 5) 3mm axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and 6) 1.5mm sagittal T1-weighted volumetric gradient echo images. Quantitative volumes were estimated on a continuous scale for hippocampus, total brain, and intracranial space. Total brain volume measurement includes cerebellum but not ventricles, cerebrospinal fluid, and dura. More information regarding image volumetric estimation can be found elsewhere [11]. As a secondary analysis, the MRI measures used in this study were those more related to neurodegenerative process from those available in the CDCAI dataset. Image acquisition parameters, interpretation, data processing, and analyses have been previously reported. Quality control included testing the images and adherence to the common protocol [47].

Neuropsychological Assessments

Neuropsychological assessments were completed within 30 days of the MRI and included the (1) the Modified Mini Mental State Test (3MS) [49], a measure of general cognition; (2) the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale digit symbol coding test (WAIS-IV Coding) [59], a measure of executive function and processing speed; (3) the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition short form (CVLT-II- SF) [60], a measure of episodic verbal learning, recall, and recognition discriminability; and 4) the Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA) [61], a measure of verbal phonemic fluency and executive function. In all of the neuropsychological tests, higher score translates in better cognitive performance.

Other Instruments and Measures

Participants completed self-administered questionnaires for sociodemographic data and blood collection for APOE phenotyping. Sex was self-reported as male or female. Education was dichotomized as up to high school or any college or more. Presence of APOE e4 (yes/no) was considered by APOE phenotype from isoelectric focusing.

Statistical Analysis

Measures of intraindividual cognitive variability

To estimate IICV, we used a method employed in other studies in this area [31, 32]. First, raw scores from each test were z-transformed based on the distribution of the entire sample. Then, z-transformed test scores were used to calculate within-person variability across the tests. For each participant, we calculated the z-scores for each neuropsychological task, then we calculated the intraindividual standard deviation of all the z-scores. The formula used to calculate the IICV is ∑k=1K(Zik-Ai)2(k-1), where Zik denote the kth cognitive test score for the ith individual and Ai represent the ith individual’s mean z-transformed cognitive score for all k tests.

Table 1 shows the cognitive domains assessed for the IICV measures, the tests used, the detailed variables from each test, as well as the initial hypothesized associations. Three IICV measures were created: (1) memory IICV (IICV-memory), using scores from the CVLT-II-SF; (2) executive function and processing speed IICV (IICV-exec), using WAIS-IV Coding and COWA; and (3) multidomain IICV (IICV-multi), using CVLT-II-SF, WAIS-IV Coding, and COWA. Higher scores reflect greater variability across cognitive measures included in each IICV index, and lower scores indicate more consistency across measures.

Regression Models

Descriptive statistics were calculated and presented as absolute and relative frequencies or as means and standard deviations. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for data normality. First, separate regressions were conducted to determine whether IICV measures could be used as explanatory measures (independent variables) in relation to MRI variables (dependent). We relied on the data structure of our dependent variables to guide our choice of the appropriate statistical analysis, which led to the use of multiple linear regression analysis (for the dependent variables total brain volume and hippocampal volume) and Poisson regression analysis (for the dependent variable white matter disease). Relevant assumptions of the statistical analytical methods were tested to ensure that they were not violated. Examination of correlations between the predictor variables revealed that none of the predictor variables were highly correlated and the collinearity statistic values fell within acceptable limits. Also, the probability plot revealed a normal distribution of the residuals, suggesting no significant deviations from normality. Scatterplots showed that the assumptions of homoscedasticity and linearity were tenable. To assess the strength of the associations between IICV and MRI measures, all regressions were adjusted for age, sex, education, APOE e4, and intracranial volume. For each regression using an IICV measure, the mean cognitive z-score across cognitive measures included in the IICV index was added to the regression to determine whether IICV accounted for the association beyond overall cognitive performance (mean).. The alpha level for statistical significance was set at 0.05, and we adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction [62]. Statistical analyses were carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 28 for Windows, and R, version 4.5 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

RESULTS

Participant Characteristics

Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of the participants, either as mean scores or frequencies. Out of the 746 older American Indian adults included in the study, 506 (67.8%) were female, with a mean age of 72.6 years (SD 5.6, range 64–95). More than 50% had attended at least some college. Table 3 presents the results of the neuropsychological battery, the measures of IICV, and MRI findings.

Associations between MRI and IICV Measures

Table 4 shows the results of the regression analyses used to evaluate the associations between MRI measures (hippocampal volume, white matter disease, and total brain volume) and IICV measures (memory, executive function and processing speed, and multidomain), adjusting for participant age, sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol use, smoking and intracranial volume. Adjustment for APOE e4 allele was examined but did not influence our results.

As shown in table 4, IICV-memory was significantly associated with hippocampal volume. Higher variability in this domain reflected in lower brain volume (Beta= −0.076; 95%CI −0.499, −0.023; p=0.031). Intracranial volume, age and diabetes were associated with hippocampal volume(Beta for intracranial volume=0.411, p&lt;0.001; Beta for age=−0.152, p&lt;0.001; and Beta for diabetes=−0.073, p=0.047). However, after applying Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the association between IICV-memory and brain volume was no longer significant (p=0.574). IICV-multi and IICV-exec were not associated with any imaging features.

To determine whether IICV-memory is associated with hippocampal volume beyond mean cognitive performance, we included mean cognitive z-score across the measures constituting IICV-memory in the previous regression models (before Bonferroni correction). The effects of the IICV-memory was attenuated and no longer significant independent of mean score (Table 5). Mean z-scores for memory was significantly associated with hippocampal volume, when adjusted by age, sex, education, body mass index, diabetes, stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, alcohol use, smoking, intracranial volume and IICV-memory (overall model: R2=0.202, F(13,687)=13.143, p&lt;0.001, mean cognitive score Beta=0.145, p&lt;0.001). Intracranial volume and age were also associated with hippocampal volume (Beta for intracranial volume=0.405, p&lt;0.001; Beta for age=−0.118, p=0.002). Diabetes was no longer associated with hippocampal volume (Beta=−0.068, p=0.063).

DISCUSSION

In this study investigating associations between IICV and MRI measures in 746 older American Indians with 3MS scores ≥70, higher IICV-memory was associated with lower hippocampal volumes. However, after adjusting for Bonferroni correction or mean cognitive scores, the association lost statistical significance. No measures of IICV were associated with grade of white matter disease or total brain volume as hypothesized. Furthermore, no associations were found between IICV-multi or IICV-exec and any imaging feature. The associations for mean score with brain measures are consistent with other populations [63–65]. The fact that the associations of IICV with MRI measures were no longer significant in the presence of mean cognitive performance in the same tests, suggest that IICV does not contribute information regarding those structural brain areas investigated over and above the contribution of overall cognitive performance in this sample. Intraindividual cognitive variability has been identified as a novel, alternative noninvasive Alzheimer’s disease marker for prodromal dementia in the general population [27, 31, 40]. To our knowledge this is the first study to investigate IICV in a sample of American Indians. Although our results demonstrate that IICV measures could not be statistically associated with robustness with cross-sectional neuroimaging features, our results encourage future studies using other brain regions as well as in the utility of IICV measures in the prediction of neurodegeneration and dementia in American Indians.

The relationship between IICV and reduced neurological integrity has been previously established [27, 31, 66, 67], with proposed mechanisms including altered functional connectivity, disrupted neural networks, and impaired cognitive control [26, 28, 36]. In this study, we focused on brain regions available for the CDCAI sample and that are associated with neurodegeneration, and preferentially affected by ADRD. Before Bonferroni correction, higher IICV-memory was associated with lower hippocampal volume (our main hypothesis), but not confirm any association with increased white matter disease or total brain volume, as initially hypothesized. This association was no longer significative with Bonferroni correction, which means that there is a chance that our finding is related to a false-positive result (type 1 error). Further investigations are needed to examine whether other brain regions or other imaging modalities (e.g., functional brain imaging, diffusion tensor imaging and longitudinal brain change) are associated with cognitive variability.

The cross-sectional study design and use of structural neuroimaging do not allow us to confirm an Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis or other pathological status. Functional changes in the brain are known to precede structural changes and cognitive decline, in some cases by many years [68, 69]. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, accumulation of amyloid-β is the initial event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, followed by the formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles, development of cortical atrophy, and then cognitive and functional decline [70, 71] in a process that may take decades. Therefore, the specific structural measures of neurodegeneration captured by MRI in this study at a single time point may not be sensitive to cognitive impairment or variance resulting from ADRD. Most studies on the utility of IICV for neurodegeneration and dementia are prospective [24, 26, 31, 35]. Previous study has shown that in middle-aged adults in the general population, IICV significantly predicted cognitive deterioration and ADRD ten years later [35]. IICV also may be related to degeneration before cognitive decline or cognitive impairment is observed, making it ideally suited for preclinical dementia research [63–65]. In our study, the effect estimates for IICV were smaller than those for mean scores, suggesting that brain volume status may have been related to manifest cognitive impairment and, therefore, not necessarily preclinical signs.

One explanation for our findings is that the areas of the brain we examined are not the most vulnerable to early neurodegenerative symptoms. Other studies investigating cross-sectional measures of IICV and neuroimaging in the general population used structural MRI to assess features in specific areas of the brain, such as entorhinal cortex atrophy, [24] or the presence of Alzheimer’s disease pathology [72]. Also, future studies should include MRI brain areas that match the cognitive domains assessed through neuropsychological testes. Other imaging techniques (such as functional neuroimaging) have been used in studies in the field [25, 72, 73]. These techniques are more sensitive to early impairments and may have bigger effect sizes in their associations with IICV than associations of mean cognitive score. Notably, neurodegeneration is not necessarily associated with functional deficits exhibited in the real-world environment. IICV may be a more sensitive predictor of everyday functional deficits in the American Indian population than neurodegeneration and this awaits further study. Finally, other conditions are contributing measurement error; that these cognitive tests are measured with excess noise and variability.

There are some important methodological differences between our study and other studies on IICV that preclude direct comparisons. First, many studies on IICV are longitudinal [24, 31–35, 74, 75] and/or use dementia diagnosis [26, 31, 40, 72, 76–78] or stablished neuropathology criteria for AD [25, 72, 79], and the present study is a cross-sectional analysis with no evaluation of dementia status. Also, many studies on IICV did not mention any multiple comparison correction [24, 25, 31–35, 72, 76, 80], while we have used a conservative approach to deal with number of pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni). Also, the inclusion of mean cognitive performance as a co-variate was not always used in other studies [32, 72]. For those studies which included mean cognitive score, most findings related to IICV remained significantly associated with the tested outcomes [24–26, 31, 34, 76–78, 80], but for other studies, after including the cognitive mean score, IICV were attenuated [33] or was not significant anymore [35]. The present study is the first to investigate IICV in a sample of American Indians. As such, it contributes toward an understanding of the utility of IICV for Indigenous populations. Developing an easily disseminatable marker of early disease to be used in low-resourced populations may represent a viable alternative to traditional biomarkers. If proved to be useful, it could be disseminated with less effort and equipment, thus benefiting diverse ethnic and racial groups. To our knowledge this study is also the first to consider cardiovascular diseases, alcohol use and smoking as confounding variables, given the high incidence of these risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia in American Indians [11–14, 81].

Strengths and Limitations

Among the strengths of this study are the large sample size, the understudied population, and the robust statistical approach that accounted for data structures and multiple testing. However, some limitations should also be considered. First, we do not have dementia or mild cognitive impairment diagnoses for our participants. Most studies investigating IICV and cerebral measures examine mild cognitive impairment and dementia criteria [24, 33, 35, 76], and for cross-sectional associations, IICV was found to be associated with brain measures among individuals with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, but not for cognitively normal aging individuals [24]. We attempted to reduce this gap by including a 3MS cutoff, removing participants with potential for increased cognitive impairment and, consequently, decreased cognitive variability. Second, the selection of specific cognitive tests may influence findings. Currently, assessments of cognition in American Indians lack adequate validated cognitive and functional measures. Also, other studies included measures of functional decline as outcomes related to IICV [24, 82]; our measures may not represent the most functionally sensitive IICV indexes for this population. In addition, IICV indices in this study do not include a measure of premorbid ability level. The use of a cognitive measure that are typically well-preserved in the early stages of dementia, such as vocabulary [83], would offer a contrast with domains more frequently affected at the beginning of AD pathology, such as episodic memory and language fluency [84], increasing the variability of subtle cognitive impairments. This limitation may represent a decrease in the sensitivity of the IICV measures here investigated. Third, some neuroimaging methods used in this study were dated and more prone to rater variability than an automated method, and we are restricted to the specific MRI measures available in the CDCAI dataset.

Recommendations for Future Studies

Future analyses should examine whether IICV could be a sensitive marker of future cognitive decline in longitudinal analyses, including the predictive validity of both IICV and mean score in relation to longitudinal changes in brain structure. Also, detailed brain regions that are often affected early in the development of dementia could add information about the usefulness of within-person cognitive variability measures taken at a single time point in predicting dementia in American Indians. Future studies of this population examining the associations between cross-domain IICV and established early markers of neurodegeneration, such as longitudinal atrophy, functional neuroimaging, plasma biomarkers and the clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, are warranted. In addition, research should examine psychometric validity, normative, and diagnostic criteria in cognitive tests for this unique population. Future studies incorporating different neuropsychological tests for specific cognitive functions or functional decline may clarify whether there is a combination of measures that could be included to maximize sensitivity to neurodegeneration and the risk of cognitive impairment and decline in American Indians.

Conclusion

We observed no significant association between IICV and structural brain measures, after controlling for confounders. This finding does not preclude IICV from being related to cognitive decline, functional decline, or neurological decline in American Indians, an investigation that deserve future research. The sparse existing scientific literature related to dementia in Indigenous populations points to increased risk [18, 85] which substantiates the need for continued research on risk factors, markers, and outcomes. Additional investigations of cognitive, imaging, and clinical measures in American Indians, specially using longitudinal study designs, are needed to determine whether IICV is a useful behavioral marker of dementia and other degenerative conditions in this historically excluded population.
