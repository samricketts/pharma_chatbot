The apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE-ε4) is established as a major genetic risk factor for cognitive decline and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Accumulating evidence has linked ε4 carriership to abnormal structural brain changes across the adult lifespan. To better understand the underlying causal mechanisms, we investigated the extent to which the effect of the ε4 allele on cognition is mediated by structural brain imaging markers in the population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility–Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik). This study included 4,527 participants (aged 76.3±5.4 at baseline) who underwent the brain magnetic resonance imaging assessment (of brain tissue volumes, white matter lesion volume, subcortical and cortical infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds) and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline. Causal mediation analysis was used to quantify the mediation of the ε4 effect on cognition by these MRI markers, both individually and jointly. We observed that about 9% of the total effect of ε4 carriership on cognition was mediated by white matter lesion volume. This proportion increased to 25% when total brain tissue volume was jointly considered with white matter lesion volume. In analyses separating ε4 homozygotes from ε4 heterozygotes, the effect on global cognition of specifically ε4 homozygosity appeared to be partially mediated by cerebral microbleeds, particularly lobar microbleeds. There was no evidence of mediation of the ε4 effect by cortical or subcortical infarcts. This study shows that the ε4 effect on cognition is partly mediated by white matter lesion volume and total brain tissue volume. These findings suggest the joint role of cerebral small vessel disease and neurodegeneration in the ε4-cognition relationship.

pmcIntroduction

The strongest and most established genetic risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein gene (APOE).(1) The major mechanism of ε4 is thought to be its effect on amyloid-beta accumulation (Aβ) in the brain.(2) Increasing evidence also suggests that APOE ε4 expression may, independent of its effects on Aβ, lead to neuronal injury through multiple mechanisms such as activating proinflammatory processes, promoting blood brain barrier breakdown and causing cerebral vascular injuries.(2, 3)

Among these emerging putative pathways, cerebrovascular pathology is a potential key player in linking APOE ε4 to cognition. Indeed, the ε4 allele has been linked to elevated ischemic stroke risk(4) and greater frequency of cerebral infarction detected at autopsy.(5, 6) Moreover, the ε4 allele is a strong risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which is characterized by Aβ deposition in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal small arteries, resulting in accumulation of cerebral small vessel disease and associated lesions.(7, 8) It has also been reported that neuroimaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease, such as white matter lesions and lobar microbleeds, were more common among ε4 carriers, and especially among ε4 homozygotes.(5) In line with these observations, both antemortem imaging and autopsy studies have found the frequent overlap between AD pathologies (i.e. Aβ and tau deposition) and vascular pathologies as well as vascular comorbidity in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.(9-13) Additionally, given that both macrovascular and microvascular pathologies may contribute to cognitive decline and dementia,(14) it is plausible that part of the ε4 effect on late-life cognition may be mediated by vascular pathology in addition to neurodegenerative pathways.

Thus far, mediation of the ε4 effect by brain vascular pathologies has only been assessed in autopsy studies,(15-18) which have generally found little evidence of mediation.(17, 18) However, there have been no population-based studies of this question using antemortem MRI, which allows for in vivo characterization of CVD markers in larger, more generalizable samples—and typically earlier in the course of disease. Consequently, in this study we examined the extent to which the effect of ε4 carriership on late-life cognition is mediated by brain MRI markers of CVD in a large, population-based cohort of older adults.

Methods

Study population

The Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility–Reykjavik Study (AGES-Reykjavik) is an epidemiologic study of genetic, behavior and environmental risk factors for late-life disease and disability in the vascular, neurocognitive, musculoskeletal, and metabolic systems(19). Participants in AGES-Reykjavik were drawn from the population-based Reykjavik Study (1967-1996) that included a random sample of 30,795 Reykjavik residents born between 1907 and 1935. Between 2002 and 2006, 5,764 surviving members of the Reykjavik Study cohort were enrolled and underwent baseline assessments for AGES-Reykjavik. During the baseline assessment, participants completed a structured questionnaire, received clinical and neurological examinations, underwent a series of brain imaging assessments, and provided laboratory samples for DNA and biomarker analysis. Questionnaire and laboratory data obtained earlier in life during Reykjavik Study assessments, including the assessment of weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels during midlife (aged 50±6 years), were also linked to AGES-Reykjavik data. The present study includes all participants from the AGES-Reykjavik study with available data on APOE genotype (n=5,740), usable brain MRI scans (n=4,616), and cognitive testing (n=5,398) at baseline, leaving 4,527 participants eligible for the current analysis. Compared to those included, individuals excluded from these analyses had worse cognitive function, were older, and had lower levels of education and worse cardiometabolic profiles. The distribution of ε4 status did not differ between included and excluded individuals (Supplementary Table 1).

APOE genotype

APOE genotyping was conducted using microplate array diagonal gel electrophoresis. APOE genotype was analyzed as: (i) a dichotomous exposure denoting ε4 risk allele carriership (ε4carriers [ε4/ε2, ε4/ε3, ε4/ε4 genotypes] versus ε4 non-carriers [ε3/ε3, ε3/ε2, ε2/ε2]), and, (ii) a three-level exposure based on number of ε4 risk alleles (ε4 homozygotes [ε4/ε4], ε4 heterozygotes [ε4/ε3, ε4/ε2], or ε4 non-carriers [ε3/ε3, ε3/ε2, ε2/ε2]). To further separate the potential confounding role of the ε2 genotype, we performed the sensitivity analysis using homozygous APOE ε3 status as the reference genotype.

Brain MRI measurements

Brain MRI was performed on a single, research-dedicated 1.5 T Signa Twinspeed EXCITE system (General Electric Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI). The structural imaging protocol used in AGES-Reykjavik has been described in detail elsewhere.(20) Technical details of aspects of image processing, classification, and validation of tissue volumes have been reported previously.(20) Volumes of gray matter, white matter, white matter lesions, and cerebral spinal fluid were generated separately using the multispectral MR images and an automatic image analysis pipeline based on the Montreal Neurological Institute pipeline that was optimized for use in the AGES-Reykjavik study. The following brain structural measures were considered in the current study.

Total brain tissue volume (TBV) was defined as the sum of the volume of gray matter, normal-appearing white matter and white matter lesion volumes obtained from the imaging processing pipeline. To correct for head size, all these volumetric measures were expressed as the percentage of total intracranial volume (i.e., the sum of TBV and cerebrospinal fluid volume). White matter lesion (WML) volume was further log-transformed in the analysis. Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) were defined as focal hypointense lesions visible on the T2*-weighted GRE images and identified by a neuroradiologist who recorded the presence, number, and slice number of microbleeds. Trained raters then viewed the identified images and recorded the anatomical location of the microbleeds. In our primary analysis, we categorized CMBs as present or absent, as most individuals did not have microbleeds. We also dichotomized CMBs as &lt;2 or ≥2 CMBs (with 4.5% having ≥2 CMBs) in a sensitivity analysis as it has been suggested that the potential adverse effect of CMBs on cognitive function becomes detectable when the count of CMBs is at least ≥2 or more.(21) Additionally, given that the pathogenesis of cerebral microbleeds may differ by their location and that ε4 carriership has been more strongly associated with lobar rather than deep microbleeds(5, 22), we further assessed lobar microbleeds (located in the frontal, parietal, occipital or temporal lobes) and deep microbleeds (located in subcortical areas) separately. Infarcts were defined as defects of the brain parenchyma with signal intensity isointense to that of cerebral spinal fluid on FLAIR, proton density/T2-weighted sequences, and with adjacent area of hyperintensity on FLAIR images. Cortical infarcts were defined as defects located in the cortical ribbon and subcortical infarcts were defined as defects surrounded by area of hyperintensity that did not extend to the cortex. Cortical and subcortical infarcts had to have a diameter of at least 4 mm. In our analyses, we categorized cortical and subcortical infarcts as present or absent.

Cognitive function

Three domains of cognitive function (i.e., memory, executive function, and processing speed) were measured with a battery of neurocognitive tests.(23) Specifically, Memory function was measured by the immediate and delayed recall subtests of a modified version of the California Verbal Learning Test.(24) Processing speed was assessed with the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Salthouse Figure Comparison Test,(25) and a modified Stroop Test Parts I (Word Reading) and II (Color Naming).(26) Executive function tests include the Digits Backward(27), a shortened version of the CANTAB spatial working memory test, and the Stroop Test Part III (Word-Color Interference).(28) Composite scores on these three domains were constructed for each participant by combining their scores on individual tests. Z-scores were obtained for each individual test and the average of z-scores across tests relevant for a particular domain was taken as the composite score for that domain. An overall global cognition composite score was calculated from the average of these three domain-specific scores and used as the primary outcome in these analyses. Dementia cases were ascertained through a 3-step process and the final diagnosis was established by a panel comprised of a geriatrician, a neurologist, a neuropsychologist, and a neuroradiologist according to DSM-IV criteria (29). The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was also made by the panel of specialists as either a deficit only in memory or one other single cognitive domain, or having deterioration in at least 2 cognitive domains but without sufficiently severe cognitive impairment or loss of instrumental activities of daily living to constitute dementia.

Covariates

Data collection for covariates in AGES-Reykjavik and the Reykjavik study has been described previously.(23) Covariates potentially associated with both brain structural changes and cognition were adjusted in all models, including age, sex, education (primary, secondary, college, university), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, or current smoker), mid-life physical activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity (never, rarely, &lt;1 hour/week, 1-3 hours/week, 4-7 hours/week, or &gt; 7 hours/week), mid-life measures of body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and diabetes diagnosis (yes, or no). The mid-life data were obtained from the study exam closest to the time the participant was 50 years of age.

Statistical Methods

To statistically assess how much of the effect of APOE4 genotype on cognition was mediated by the measured brain MRI markers, we used causal mediation analysis based on the counterfactual outcome framework.(30, 31) In this framework, the average total, direct and indirect effects were calculated using a regression-based approach. In this context, the total effect of ε4 exposure is the difference in global cognition z-score between an ε4 exposure level and an ε4 reference level. This total effect was decomposed into two non-overlapping components: the indirect effect (or mediated effect) and the direct effect. Specifically, the indirect effect indicates the effect of APOE4 genotype on cognition that is acting through the measured brain markers and is the estimate of interest, and the direct effect is the effect through pathways not involving measured brain MRI markers. The proportion mediated, as an index of the degree of mediation, was obtained by dividing the indirect effect by the total effect.(31) This approach gives valid estimates provided that the baseline covariates suffice to control for exposure-outcome-, mediator-outcome-, and exposure-mediator confounding.(30-32) The validity of these assumptions is addressed in the Discussion.

We first estimated the degree to which the ε4 effect on global cognition was mediated by each CVD marker individually (individual mediator analysis). First, we regressed each CVD marker on ε4 status, adjusting for the covariates as described above (age, sex, education, smoking status, mid-life physical activity, mid-life measures of body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and diabetes diagnosis). Linear regression was used for WML volume and TBV, while logistic regression was used for CMBs, and subcortical and cortical infarcts. Next, for each CVD marker separately, we regressed the global cognition z-score on ε4 status, the CVD marker, a product term denoting the interaction between ε4 carriership and the CVD marker and the same covariates as above using linear regression. Direct and indirect effects were estimated by combining the parameter estimates from these models according to the analytic expressions in the literature(33). The ε4-CVD marker interaction term was included to allow for the decomposition of the total effect into direct and indirect effects in the presence of exposure-mediator interaction.(32) To further quantify how much of the effect of the ε4 allele on cognition is attributable to mediation and interaction involving the individual brain MRI markers, we applied the method and analytical expressions provided by VanderWeele(34) to decompose the total effect into four distinct components: the controlled direct effect (i.e., the effect due to neither mediation nor interaction), the pure indirect effect (i.e., the effect due to mediation alone), the reference interaction (i.e., the effect due to interaction alone), and the mediated interaction (i.e., the effect due to both mediation and interaction), with further details provided in the supplement and elsewhere.(34)

In order to estimate the degree to which the effect of ε4 carriership on global cognition was mediated by the CVD markers jointly we considered the markers that showed some evidence of mediation in a multiple mediator model (multiple mediation analysis) (33). As a decrease in TBV relative to head size likely reflects brain atrophy arising from both vascular and neurodegenerative processes, we carried out an additional mediation analysis separating TBV from presumed vascular markers (WML and CMBs). Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used to obtain confidence intervals for these estimates.

In the secondary analyses, we repeated all analyses for each of the three individual cognitive domains: memory, executive function and processing speed. As the ε4 carrier versus ε4 non-carrier analysis largely reflects comparisons of ε4 heterozygotes to ε4 non-carriers, we repeated analyses separating ε4 homozygotes from ε4 heterozygotes, so that mediated effects could be specifically estimated for comparisons of ε4 heterozygotes to ε4 homozygotes and ε4 non-carriers. In the sensitivity analysis, we used a published bias formula (35) to determine how much the direct and indirect effect estimates in our primary individual mediator analysis would be expected to change under different assumptions of the association between an unmeasured binary confounder and ε4 status and global cognition.

Results

Table 1 summarizes baseline characteristics of the 4527 participants included in the current study (mean age: 76.3 [SD: 5.4], women: 58.0%). Of these participants, 3257 (71.9%) were ε4 non-carriers, 1180 (26.1%) were ε4 heterozygotes and 90 (2.0%) were ε4 homozygotes. 3845 (85.5%) participants were identified as having normal cognition at baseline, 408 as having mild cognitive impairment and the remaining 242 as having dementia. The distributions of brain MRI markers by ε4 status are also reported in Table 1. Mean TBV was slightly lower among ε4 carriers than among ε4 non-carriers; CMBs were only slightly more common among ε4 carriers overall, but were markedly more common among ε4 homozygotes than among ε4 non-carriers, largely due to lobar microbleeds being more frequent, particularly among ε4 homozygotes (All P values&lt;0.05). The distributions of mean WML volume and cortical and subcortical infarcts did not differ significantly by ε4 carrier status (All P values&gt;0.05).

Individual mediator analysis

Table 2 shows the mediation effect of individual MRI markers on the association of APOE4 with global cognition. The effect of ε4 carriership was partially mediated by increased WML volume and lower TBV but did not appear to be mediated by the presence of CMBs, subcortical or cortical infarcts. The effect through increased WML volume was −0.008 (−0.014, −0.0004) in standard units, and the proportion mediated was 9.0%. The effect through lower TBV was −0.014 (−0.024, −0.003) in standard units and the proportion mediated was 15.4%. The interaction terms between ε4 carriership and these CVD markers were not statistically significant. Further four-way decomposition analysis shows that the observed mediation effects of WML and TBV were mainly attributable to the pure indirect effects, that were statistically significant (−0.007 [−0.013, −0.002] for WML and −0.012 [−0.021, −0.003] for TBV; Supplementary Table 2). The pattern of results observed was similar across cognitive domains (Supplementary Table 3). As also shown in Table 2, in stratified analyses looking separately at ε4 homozygotes vs. non-carriers and ε4 heterozygotes vs. ε4 non-carriers, the portion of the effect mediated by lower WML volume was similar to that observed when comparing all ε4 carriers to non-carriers, while the effect mediated through lower TBV volume appeared much greater in ε4 heterozygotes: indirect effect=−0.014 (−0.023, −0.004) in standard units and proportion mediated=18.7%. In contrast, increased occurrence of CMBs appeared to mediate the differences in cognition between ε4 homozygotes and ε4 non-carriers (proportion mediated=20.0%) but not between ε4 heterozygotes and ε4 non-carriers. The results were similar when restricted to lobar microbleeds as the mediator. There was no evidence of mediation by subcortical or cortical infarcts across any of these genotype comparisons.

Multiple mediator analysis

The proportion of the effect of ε4 carriership on global cognition jointly mediated by WML volume, CMBs and TBV was 25.4 % (indirect effect =−0.023 (−0.035, −0.009) standard units, substantially larger than the 9.4% of the ε4 effect jointly mediated by WML volume and CMBs alone (indirect effect =−0.008 [−0.014, 0.000] standard units). The portion of the effect of ε4 heterozygosity and homozygosity carriership on global cognition jointly mediated by WML volume, CMBs and TBV was 27.4% and 32.0%, respectively.

Secondary and sensitivity analysis

When we stratified the analyses by baseline cognitive status, the mediation effect appeared to be stronger among those with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, though these results were not statistically significant (Supplementary Table 4). In our sensitivity analyses using homozygous APOE ε3 status as the reference genotype, the mediation effects by individual MRI markers were similar (Supplementary Table 5). When we dichotomized CMBs as &lt;2 or ≥2, the proportion of the effect mediated by CMBs was 4.2% (indirect effect =−0.036 (−0.007, −0.001) standard units), which was slightly higher than those from the primary analysis though not statistically significant. Using the bias formula in our sensitivity analysis, we found that the proportion mediated by an individual MRI marker would be overestimated if another unmeasured confounding factor beneficial to cognition, such as traits selected on survival in ε4 carriers, were more prevalent among ε4 carriers conditional on similar CVD marker status. Assuming a modest effect on cognition (e.g., a 0.05 standard unit improvement) of such an unmeasured factor, the prevalence of the confounding factor would need to be at least 16.0% greater among ε4 carriers than among ε4 non-carriers, conditional on CVD marker status, to remove the mediation effect. On the other hand, because the CVD markers were measured at a single point in time, bias analysis suggests that this could result in an underestimate of the proportion mediated.(36)

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study, we found that a small but measurable portion of the overall negative effect of APOE ε4 carriership on cognition was mediated by higher WML volume and lower TBV. Comparing ε4 carriers to ε4 non-carriers, about 9% of the ε4 effect was mediated by WML volume, and the portion mediated increased to 25% when WML and TBV were considered together. In stratified analyses looking separately at ε4 homozygotes and ε4 heterozygotes, the effect of ε4 homozygosity on cognition appeared to be partially mediated by CMBs. We found no evidence of mediation of the ε4 effect by cortical or subcortical infarcts.

The contribution of brain pathologies to the effect of ε4 carriership on AD dementia or late-life cognition has previously been investigated mainly in autopsy studies. It has been reported in the Religious Orders Study, the Memory and Aging Project, and the Nun study that the association between the ε4 allele and cognitive decline was mainly explained by measures of amyloid plaque and tangle pathology, but not by measures of macro and micro infarcts and degree of atherosclerosis in the circle of Willis at autopsy (16-18), suggesting that the ε4 allele largely exerts its effect on cognition through AD pathology. The predominantly direct effect of ε4 carriership observed here supports these observations. However, unlike these studies, we found some evidence of mediation of the ε4 effect by markers of vascular disease, especially WML. This discrepancy may be explained by several factors. First, the CVD brain markers assessed in these studies were different. These autopsy studies have largely assessed vascular lesions using infarct measures, whereas we were able to additionally assess pre-mortem MRI markers of WML volume and CMBs, which have been more consistently associated with ε4 carriership than infarct measures.(5) Second, pre-mortem MRI measures are likely to capture vascular pathology such as white matter lesions and microbleeds better than post-mortem neuropathological measures. Consistent with these autopsy studies, we did not find the mediation of the ε4 effect by brain infarct measures, which is also in line with a systematic review of neuroimaging studies that found no association between ε4 carriership and (mostly lacunar) brain infarcts. The review also noted that ε4 carriership was associated with higher WML burden, and greater occurrence of CMBs, especially lobar microbleeds, with larger associations among ε4 homozygotes, supporting our finding on the partial mediation of the ε4 effect by WML volume and CMBs and larger mediated effects when separating out ε4 homozygotes. Additionally, the contribution of ε4 to vascular pathology has also been supported by data from animal studies, showing that ε4 may lead to accelerated breakdown of blood brain barrier and increase susceptibility to neuronal damage after brain ischemic injury.(37-39)

The population average cognitive scores analyzed here reflect individual differences in cognitive performance. As most individuals are cognitively normal or only mildly impaired, the estimated total effect of even a strong risk factor such as ε4 carriership on cognition will be small. The magnitude of the ε4 effect mediated by a particular brain marker partially depends on the strength of the ε4-marker association; thus, markers that are more strongly associated with ε4 carriership will have larger mediated effects. Among those vascular MRI markers examined, the mediation role of WML is most notable. This is not surprising given that WML is more prevalent in the study population than CMBs and brain infarcts. In addition, WML was analyzed as a continuous variable, likely capturing more of the variability in the underlying pathological changes. Also, WML is thought to be a marker of generalized vascular damage underlying several pathologies including arteriosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).(40, 41) We also found that the effect of ε4 homozygosity on cognition appeared to be partially mediated by CMBs, especially lobar CMBs. Epidemiologic and imaging evidence suggests that microbleeds in lobar areas are specifically indicative of advanced CAA.(42, 43) The ε4 allele, especially homozygous ε4 genotype, is a risk factor for lobar microbleeds and CAA in both cognitively normal and AD populations. (5, 44-47) It has been shown in an autopsy study that CAA may mediate the ε4 effect on cognition (48). Other studies have also reported lobar microbleeds or severe CAA to be increased most markedly among ε4 homozygotes.(46, 49-51) These observations are consistent with our findings on the potential mediating role of CMB in the ε44-cognition relationship, which await confirmation in future studies with larger sample sizes of ε4 homozygotes. The remainder of the mediated effect was attributable to lower TBV, an indicator of brain atrophy. Brain atrophy on neuroimaging may be a consequence of either vascular or AD pathologies.(52, 53) The ε4 effect mediated by TBV probably reflects the joint effects on cognition of both AD and vascular pathology.

Strengths and limitations

Several limitations warrant discussion. First, MRI markers and cognitive function were both measured at baseline, and our analyses were cross-sectional, so we could not examine the rate of cognitive decline as our outcome, which might have better captured between-subject variation in the cognitive impact of vascular pathology. Also, as the potential mediators and the outcome of interest were both measured at baseline, the temporal order of mediation association needs to be determined in future studies with longitudinal data. Second, valid estimation of direct and indirect effects in mediation analyses requires that unmeasured confounding assumptions be met. As AGES-Reykjavik is conducted in an ethnically homogenous population, it is unlikely that ethnicity-related genes will result in major confounding of the ε4-CVD marker or ε4-cognition relationships. However, inadequate confounding control is more likely to be an issue in the relationship between CVD markers and cognition. For example, unmeasured factors such as poor sleep quality or subclinical vascular dysfunction may confound this mediator-outcome relationship. Although our results did not change appreciably with adjustment for a range of demographic and clinical variables, our sensitivity analyses suggest that our estimates of mediated effects could still be biased upwards due to residual confounding between CVD markers and cognition. On the other hand, because the CVD markers were measured at a single point in time, non-differential measurement error in the binary mediators is likely, which could lead to underestimated mediated effects. (36)

Despite these limitations, as one of the few population-based studies addressing this research question using antemortem MRI, we were able to characterize a range of pre-mortem in vivo MRI markers of vascular pathology that are not captured well in autopsy studies. Our study also has important implications. It adds one more key perspective to the growing picture that both vascular and AD pathologies jointly contribute to cognitive decline.(11, 54) Given that brain vascular injuries may develop at differing rates on different time scales, their associations with AD dementia risk factors and cognition may vary at different disease stages. In future work, taking a life course perspective would help us better understand the relationships between established risk factors, vascular pathologies, AD pathologies, and cognitive impairment. Our finding on the vascular contributions to the adverse effect of APOE4 on cognitive function also suggests the potential of targeting vascular pathology for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in APOE ε4 carriers.

In conclusion, our results suggest that a small but not negligible portion of the ε4 effect on cognition is mediated by CVD pathology. The corresponding finding that the ε4 effect primarily operates through non-vascular pathways aligns with previous research and present understanding of the action of APOE in AD and CVD pathogenesis. Also of interest in our findings is that some of the effect of ε4 homozygosity appeared to be mediated by CMBs, suggesting a greater vascular contribution for these individuals. Further studies in other population-based studies are needed to confirm these findings.
