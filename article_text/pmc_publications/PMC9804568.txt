Objective:

To assess cross-sectional and longitudinal [18F]-flortaucipir PET uptake in pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and to compare FTLD to cases with high and low levels of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC).

Methods:

One-hundred forty-three participants who had completed at least one flortaucipir PET and autopsy-confirmed FTLD (n=52) or high (n=58) or low-ADNC (n=33) based on Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages 0-IV versus V-VI, were included. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated for nine regions of interest (ROIs): an FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain, globus pallidum, an AD-Meta-ROI, entorhinal, inferior temporal, orbitofrontal, precentral, and medial parietal. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare mean baseline SUVRs and annual rate of change in SUVR, by group. Sensitivity/specificity to distinguish FTLD from high and low-ADNC was calculated.

Results:

Baseline uptake in the FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain and globus pallidus were greater in FTLD than high and low-ADNC. No region showed a greater rate of flortaucipir accumulation in FTLD. Baseline uptake in the AD related regions, orbitofrontal and precentral cortices were greater in high-ADNC, and all showed greater rates of accumulation compared to FTLD. Baseline differences were superior to longitudinal rates in differentiating FTLD from high and low-ADNC. A simple baseline metric of midbrain/inferior temporal ratio of flortaucipir uptake provided good-excellent differentiation between FTLD and high and low-ADNC (sensitivities/specificities = 94%/95% and 71%/70%).

Interpretation:

There are cross-sectional and longitudinal differences in flortaucipir uptake between FTLD and high and low-ADNC. However, optimum differentiation between FTLD and ADNC was achieved with baseline uptake, rather than longitudinal rates.

pmcIntroduction

Molecular positron emission tomography (PET) ligands that bind to tau proteins, such as [18F] flortaucipir1, allow the in vivo assessment of the presence and distribution of tau deposition in the brain. Flortaucipir shows excellent binding to the 3R+4R paired helical filament tau deposited as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)2–4. Indeed, elevated uptake of flortaucipir is observed in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia5, 6, and the severity and regional distribution of uptake matches well with underlying Braak NFT stage in AD7–10. Furthermore, it has been shown that flortaucipir PET outperforms other neuroimaging modalities in differentiating AD from other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases.11 Longitudinal studies of flortaucipir have demonstrated increasing uptake over time in patients with Alzheimer’s dementia12, 13, although it is unknown how longitudinal changes relate to autopsy findings in AD.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in patients under age 65 years14. FTLD is an umbrella term that encompasses several different molecular pathologies that target the frontal and temporal lobes, particularly pathologies characterized by the deposition of 4R tau, 3R tau and the TAR DNA binding of 43 kDa (TDP-43)15. The majority of FTLD cases are sporadic although genetic mutations have been identified16. Many different clinical syndromes are associated with FTLD molecular pathology including those characterized predominantly by impairment of speech and language, and personality and behavioral change, as well as disorders with prominent pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor features. Elevated flortaucipir uptake has been observed in frontotemporal, subcortical and brainstem regions in the FTLD clinical syndromes17–24, including in those associated with underlying 4R tau18, 20, 21, 3R tau25, and FTLD-TDP17, 19, 22, 26, with longitudinal changes in uptake observed in two FTLD clinical syndromes18. Cross-sectionally, flortaucipir uptake in FTLD is typically milder than that observed in AD, with uptake observed in a different regional distribution18, 27, 28. It is unknown whether rates of change in flortaucipir differ between FTLD and AD and if regional distinctions are relevant longitudinally. It is also unknown how cross-sectional uptake compares to longitudinal change across the two diseases. Addressing these knowledge gaps would help answer the question of which approach and associated brain regions are superior and hence, can be utilized as biomarkers to differentiate FTLD from AD.

In this study, we aimed to determine whether regional cross-sectional and longitudinal flortaucipir PET findings differ between sporadic FTLD and AD, and how best to differentiate between the two diseases. To achieve our aims, we use autopsy-confirmed cohorts. This allowed us to specifically assess how FTLD compares to cases with high and low probabilities of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathological changes (ADNC)29. We hypothesize that in FTLD-specific regions, baseline flortaucipir uptake will be greater in FTLD than in high and low ADNC, that there will be comparable regional rates of uptake over time between FTLD and low ADNC, and that AD specific regions would best differentiate between high ADNC and FTLD.

Methods

Participants

To be included in this study all participants had to 1) have completed at least one flortaucipir PET scan, and 2) died with an autopsy diagnosis of an FTLD spectrum disease or ADNC (any combination of Braak NFT Stages 0-VI and Thal phases 0–5). All FTLD cases also had to have screened negative for a mutation in all three major FTLD associated genes including MAPT, GRN and C9ORF7216. We chose not to include FTLD participants with genetic mutations given that some mutations are associated with 3R+4R Alzheimer’s type neuropathology and show flortaucipir uptake in the range associated with high ADNC, and hence would confound the results30.We identified 147 participants that met our inclusion criteria and excluded four patients with low levels of ADNC that had another “primary” pathological diagnosis (three with multiple system atrophy and one with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, MELAS). All remaining 143 participants had been recruited into an NIH funded study between January 1st, 2015, and August 30st 2021. The FTLD participants had all been recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG), and the ADNC participants had been recruited by NRG, the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging.

The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB, and all participants and their proxies provided written informed consent to participate in this study.

Neuropathology

All 143 participants had died and underwent standard neuropathological examination performed by a board-certified neuropathologist (DWD or RR) as previously described in detail26. Of the 143 participants, 52 met criteria for FTLD31 with focal neuronal loss and gliosis affecting frontal and/or temporal lobe, while the rest of the cohort did not have features of FTLD but showed varying amounts of ADNC. The majority (n=46) of the FTLD cohort consisted of cases with tau molecular pathology (FTLD-tau [44 with 4R tau; two with 3R tau])32, with six cases having TDP-43, i.e., FTLD-TDP32. For the purpose of this study and guided by the National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association recommendations, we subclassified the 91 ADNC participants into high and low/intermediate (referred to from here onwards as low) ADNC groups based on the following Braak NFT stage33: low-ADNC (n=33, Braak NFT stage ≤IV), or high-ADNC (n=58, Braak NFT stage &gt;IV)29. The criteria used to split the ADNC group were also motivated by our aim to match the low-ADNC group to the FTLD group in terms of the Braak NFT stage33, since it is well-known that some FTLD cases also have NFTs.

Image acquisition

All 143 participants underwent a structural head MRI and flortaucipir tau-PET scan. Flortaucipir PET scans were acquired using a PET/CT scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) operating in 3D mode. An intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370MBq (range 333–407 MBq) of flortaucipir was administered, followed by a 20-minute PET acquisition performed 80 minutes after injection. The [18F] flortaucipir scans consisted of four 5-minute dynamic frames following a low dose CT transmission scan. Standard corrections were applied. Emission data were reconstructed into a 256×256 matrix with a 30-cm field of view (in-plane pixel size=1.17mm). All participants also underwent a 3T head MRI protocol using GE scanners that included a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR/TE/TI, 2300/3/900 ms; flip angle 8°, 26-cm field of view (FOV); 256×256 in-plane matrix; phase FOV of 0.94; slice thickness of 1.2 mm). The MRI scans were performed a median of one day from the flortaucipir PET scans.

Image processing

Baseline (cross-sectional) measurements:

Each PET image was rigidly registered to its corresponding MPRAGE using SPM12 (Welcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK). Using ANTs, the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt/) atlases were propagated to the native MPRAGE space and used to calculate regional PET values in the grey and white matter. Tissue probabilities were determined for each MPRAGE using Unified Segmentation in SPM12, with MCALT tissue priors and settings. Standard uptake value ratios were created normalizing uptake in each region of interest (ROI) to the cerebellar crus grey matter34. Two compartment partial volume correction (PVC) was applied.

Longitudinal (change) measurements:

Sixty-three subjects had at least two flortaucipir PET scans with one scan failing preprocessing leaving 62 subjects for longitudinal analyses. We assessed change in tau PET SUVR using a previously published in-house intra-subject cross-time longitudinal pipeline35 shown to enhance repeatability and effect sizes of change measurements. Briefly, intra-subject MRIs were group-coregistered and bias fields (intensity inhomogeneity) were harmonized before creating a non-linear single-subject template (T1-SST) with atlas spatial normalization using Advanced Registration Tools35. MRIs were each resampled to this T1-SST space and individually segmented using the same methods as in the cross-sectional pipeline above, to produce tissue probabilities and atlas ROIs. Intra-subject PETs across time were group-coregistered to form a rigid single-subject PET template (PET-SST). A single rigid registration was computed between T1-SST and PET-SST, and this was used to resample all PETs to the space of T1-SST. Two-compartment PVC was applied, and SUVRs were calculated using the atlas ROIs from each PET in T1-SST space. Unlike the cross-sectional pipeline, our SUVR normalization for change measurements used a composite reference region comprised of eroded supratentorial white matter, pons, and whole cerebellum35.

Regions of interest:

We analyzed nine specific ROIs that were selected a priori. First, regional uptake was calculated in two Meta-ROIs: 1) an FTLD Meta-ROI that consisted of five subcortical brain regions that have been shown to have elevated flortaucipir uptake in FTLD18, 20 (thalamus, dentate nucleus of cerebellum, globus pallidum, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain); and 2) an AD Meta-ROI that consisted of six cortical brain regions that typically show elevated flortaucipir uptake in AD (entorhinal cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal, fusiform, inferior temporal, and middle temporal gyri). The FTLD Meta-ROI was selected based on previous studies that have found these regions are most affected in autopsy confirmed FTLD-tau26, as well as in clinically diagnosed behavioral variant FTD cases24, where FTLD-TDP pathology would be expected to account for at least 50% of the cases36. Previous studies show that the AD Meta-ROI cut-point accurately captures within subject tau signal for longitudinal analysis and has broad dynamic range across the normal to AD spectrum12. For each Meta-ROI, a weighted average of uptake was calculated across regions. Seven additional regions were also specifically assessed: inferior temporal cortex, entorhinal cortex, precentral cortex, medial parietal cortex (posterior cingulate + precuneus), midbrain, globus pallidum, and orbitofrontal cortex. The precentral cortex and orbitofrontal cortex were selected due to their involvement in both FTLD and AD20, 21, 24, 37.

Statistical analyses

We compared regional mean baseline flortaucipir SUVR values across neuropathological diagnosis groups by fitting a linear regression model in each region of interest. These models used baseline log-transformed SUVR from the cross-sectional pipeline as the response and neuropathological diagnosis group as the primary predictor. Age, years from baseline scan to death, and presence/absence of vascular disease (small/large/ischemic/hemorrhagic infarctions) identified on MRI were included as covariates. We also used SUVR values from the longitudinal pipeline described above to compare mean rates of change across groups by fitting linear mixed effects models in each region of interest. These mixed models were fit only among those with at least two PET scans. We used log SUVR as the response and included the following fixed effects: age at first tau PET, years from baseline scan to death, presence/absence of vascular disease (any infarctions) on MRI, neuropathological diagnosis group, time from first tau PET, and a group-by-time interaction. Each model also included participant-specific random intercepts and slopes. We used a log transformation in our regression models to address right skew, to account for the tendency for greater intrinsic variability at higher SUVR values, and so that regression coefficients could be interpreted as percentage differences after the back-transformation 100 × (exp(β) ‒ 1). The percentage difference interpretation is particularly convenient because it allows for direct comparisons between groups and across regions of interest. We used the stan_lmer function in the rstanarm package with R version 4.0.3 to fit models mixed effects models using a Bayesian framework with weakly informative priors38. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by omitting the six FTLD-TDP participants and performing the linear regression and mixed model analyses described above.

We also performed an AUROC analysis using participants’ first tau PET and using participants’ annual rate of change obtained from the longitudinal pipeline and estimated via a least square fit to everyone’s log SUVR values over time. A cut-off minimizing the difference between sensitivity and specificity was used to characterize the diagnostic properties of baseline and annual change in tau PET in each ROI. We used a chi-squared test among the subset of participants with serial PET scans to test for any significant difference between baseline AUROC and annual change in AUROC for the AD-Meta-ROI and among all participants to test for any significant difference between the ratios of midbrain/inferior temporal and FTLD-Meta-ROI/AD-Meta-ROI, and the best ROI that differentiated between groups for each comparison. The ratio of midbrain/inferior temporal was motivated by our goal to generate a simple variable that could easily be calculated, yet potentially superior to any individual ROI given that it takes into account an FTLD ROI with prominent increased uptake in FTLD but less so in ADNC (midbrain) divided by an ADNC ROI with prominent increased uptake in ADNC but less so in FTLD (inferior temporal).

Results

Demographic and clinical differences between the three groups

There were significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the three groups (Table 1). Differences were observed in sex, with the lowest frequency of females observed in low-ADNC, and in APOE ε4 frequency, with the lowest frequency observed in FTLD. The FTLD group was the youngest at baseline scan and death. Both FTLD and high-ADNC groups were more cognitively and functionally impaired than the low-ADNC group. Antemortem clinical diagnoses differed between the three groups, as expected, with the majority of the FTLD group having a frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndrome (87%), the majority of the high-ADNC group having mild cognitive impairment/Alzheimer’s disease dementia (86%), and about half of the participants in the low-ADNC group being cognitively unimpaired (52%). Frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes in the FTLD group were split almost equally between a cognitive or behavioral dominant presentation (behavioral variant FTD, agrammatic/non-fluent primary progressive aphasia and semantic primary progressive aphasia, n=23) and a motor dominant presentation (progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal syndrome; n=22) covering the spectrum of FTLD related clinical syndromes39. Pathologically, the Braak NFT stage, Thal phase and presence of Lewy bodies also differed across groups, although the FTLD and low ADNC groups had relatively similar median Braak NFT stages as per study design.

Sixty-two participants had more than one flortaucipir PET scan (Table 2), with 36 participants having two serial scans, 18 having three serial scans, 8 having four serial scans and 1 participant having five serial scans. There were similar differences and or trends in demographic and clinical features across the three groups in the longitudinal cohort as in the larger cross-sectional cohort. Of note, participants with low-ADNC in the longitudinal cohort were more functionally impaired as a group and less likely to be cognitively unimpaired (33%) compared to those in the cross-sectional cohort (52%).

Flortaucipir differences between the three groups

Serial flortaucipir PET SUVRs in the cohort for all nine ROIs is shown in Figure 1. There was significant overlap observed across groups for the FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain, and pallidum. For the remaining six ROI’s, more separation was observed with the high-ADNC group showing greater SUVRs compared to the low-ADNC and FTLD groups. This was particularly striking for the AD-Meta-ROI, and the inferior temporal and medial parietal cortices.

The results of the mixed effects analysis are shown in Table 3 and Figure 2. The FTLD group had greater baseline flortaucipir uptake in the FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain and globus pallidus compared to both the high and low-ADNC groups. On the other hand, the FTLD group and the low-ADNC group showed lower baseline flortaucipir uptake in the AD-Meta-ROI, entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, precentral cortex, and medial parietal cortex compared to the high-ADNC group. There was no difference in flortaucipir uptake in these six regions between low-ADNC and FTLD.

The FTLD group showed lower rates of longitudinal flortaucipir change in the AD-Meta-ROI, inferior temporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and precentral cortex compared to the high-ADNC group (Table 3 and Figure 2).

The results of the sensitivity analysis that excluded the FTLD-TDP cases, and hence compared FTLD-tau to high and low-ADNC did not differ from those that included all FTLD participants (Figure 3).

Sensitivity and specificity of the eight ROIs

Sensitivity and specificity data is shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6. The baseline AD-Meta-ROI, entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, midbrain/inferior temporal ratio and FTLD-Meta-ROI/AD-Meta-ROI ratio SUVRs all had excellent AUROCs ≥0.90, with high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between high-ADNC and both FTLD and low-ADNC. The baseline FTLD-Meta-ROI, midbrain, precentral cortex, midbrain/inferior temporal ratio and FTLD-Meta-ROI/AD-Meta-ROI ratio SUVRs had acceptable AUROCs (&gt;0.75) to differentiate FTLD from low-ADNC, with 71% sensitivity and 70% specificity achieved for the midbrain/inferior temporal ratio. The AUROCs to differentiate between groups using rates of flortaucipir change were not as good as baseline measures. Only the FTLD-Meta-ROI/AD-Meta-ROI ratio SUVR achieved an AUROC of &gt; 0.75 to differentiate between high ADNC and FTLD with 65% sensitivity and 67% specificity. The only ROI to have an AUROC &gt; 0.75 to differentiate between FTLD and low-ADNC was the FTLD Meta-ROI with 65% sensitivity and 67% specificity. The only ROI to have an excellent AUROC to differentiate between high-ADNC and low-ADNC was the precentral ROI (AUROC = 0.84) which had 70% sensitivity and 67% specificity.

Among the 62 participants who had completed longitudinal flortaucipir PET scanning, the cross-sectional AD-Meta-ROI AUROC was significantly greater than the longitudinal AD-Meta-ROI AUROC for differentiating FTLD and high-ADNC (0.90 vs. 0.73, χ2(1 d.f.)=4.5, p=0.03).

Among the 143 participants who had completed baseline flortaucipir PET scanning, the AUROC for the midbrain/inferior temporal ratio was greater than the AUROC for the AD-Meta-ROI for differentiating FTLD and high-ADNC (Table 4) (0.99 vs. 0.94, χ2(1 d.f.)=5.4, p=0.02), but no differences in AUROCs were observed between the midbrain/inferior temporal ratio and the FTLD-Meta-ROI for differentiating FTLD and low-ADNC (Table 5) (0.80 vs. 0.77, χ2(1 d.f.)=0.3, p=0.60) or the AD-Meta-ROI for differentiating high-ADNC and low-ADNC (Table 6) (0.94 vs 0.93, χ2(1 d.f.)=0.3, p=0.60).

Flortaucipir comparison between FTLD subgroups

As a secondary analysis, we stratified the FTLD group by molecular pathology, i.e., FTLD-Tau (n=46) versus FTLD-TDP (n=6). Both groups had a similar frequency of female participants (FTLD-tau 39%; FTLD-TDP 50%), and similar APOE ε4 allele frequency (FTLD-Tau 21%; FTLD-TDP 17%). Median age at onset in the FTLD-tau subgroup was 64 years (IQR: 57–72 years) compared to 57 years (range: 56–57) in FTLD-TDP. The flortaucipir baseline SUVRs and rates of change for the FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP cases are shown in Figure 4. There was a lot of overlap between groups for baseline and rates of change with little evidence for any one ROI being strikingly different between the two groups except for possibly medial parietal cortex.

Interpretation

This study demonstrates that [18F] flortaucipir PET has a specific regional pattern of uptake in subcortical structures in FTLD and that uptake in these regions is greater in FTLD than both high and low-ADNC, although less differences were observed longitudinally. Excellent differentiation of FTLD and high-ADNC is obtained with baseline uptake in AD-related regions which are more affected in high-ADNC although optimum differentiation is obtained with a simple ratio of midbrain/inferior temporal SUVR.

The FTLD group showed elevated baseline uptake in the midbrain, pallidum, and an FTLD-Meta-ROI that also included the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus. Elevated tau PET uptake has previously been observed in these regions, except for the FTLD-Meta-ROI, in clinical cohorts of patients suspected of having underlying FTLD, such as those with behavioral variant FTD24, and those with motor predominant syndromes18, 20, 21, and in autopsy confirmed FTLD-tau patients26. We extend these findings by showing that uptake in these regions, including an FTLD-Meta-ROI, was greater than that observed in participants with both low and high probability ADNC thereby demonstrating specificity for FTLD. Elevated tau PET uptake has also previously been observed in precentral cortex and frontal cortex in clinical FTLD cohorts20, 24, although our study shows that these regions are strikingly more affected in high-ADNC compared to FTLD. As expected, our AD-related ROIs, including the AD-Meta-ROI, entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, and medial parietal cortex also showed greater uptake in high-ADNC compared to FTLD. These AD-related ROIs showed excellent AUROC values to differentiate FTLD from high-AD with sensitivity and specificity values comparable to those previously observed to differentiate clinically diagnosed cohorts of AD from non-AD dementias11. The FTLD-Meta-ROI showed only moderate sensitivity/specificity values to differentiate FTLD from high-ADNC but provided good differentiation of FTLD from low-ADNC. This is intuitive if we consider that the Braak NFT stages were similar in FTLD and low-ADNC and therefore AD related regions would be expected to do poorly at separating the groups, with FTLD related regions being better. The reason for the FTLD-Meta-ROI being better able to differentiate FTLD from low-ADNC compared to high-ADNC may be because the FTLD-related regions are more likely to have higher NFT burden in high-ADNC compared to low-ADNC. Flortaucipir metrics, therefore, have potential clinical utility to differentiate sporadic FTLD patients from both low and high-ADNC patients.

Longitudinal differences were also observed between FTLD and high-ADNC, with the high-ADNC participants showing greater rates of tau accumulation in all temporal and cortical regions, except the entorhinal and medial parietal cortices. Increased rates of tau accumulation in the AD-Meta-ROI and lateral temporal regions have also been observed in clinically diagnosed Alzheimer dementia patients compared to cognitively unimpaired controls12, 40. The lack of difference in the entorhinal cortex is interesting and could reflect the fact that entorhinal tau deposition occurs early in FTLD patients. The entorhinal cortex is one of the first regions to show tau uptake in preclinical AD6, 41, 42, and 19% of the FTLD participants had a Braak stage of IV and, hence, could have enough tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex to be detected with flortaucipir PET7, 10, 26. It is also possible that tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex in the high-ADNC participants has somewhat plateaued given its lower rates of tau accumulation compared to other temporal and cortical regions. The concept that tau deposition measured by flortaucipir PET reaches a plateau in the earliest affected regions but continues to spread into later affected regions has previously been hypotheszied37, 43, 44. The lack of a difference in rate for the medial parietal cortex is less clear. It is intriguing that by removing the six FTLD-TDP participants the difference in medial parietal rates almost becomes significant. Although longitudinal differences were observed between high-ADNC and FTLD, the effect sizes to differentiate these pathologies were much lower than those observed for baseline uptake in the AD-related regions. This may be due in part to the large degree of variability observed in the longitudinal rate estimates likely resulting from measurement noise, artifacts, and potentially off-target uptake45, or may suggest that progressive tau accumulation is occurring across these regions in both groups. It is also worth noting that although no other FTLD ROI reached significance for longitudinal change, that there was a trend for the FTLD-Meta-ROI having higher accumulation rates in FTLD compared to high-ADNC, which supports the FTLD Meta-ROI being able to detect meaningful change over time. It is very likely that not reaching significance was due to limited power of the longitudinal sample. Regardless of the explanation, flortaucipir PET is clearly better able to differentiate FTLD from ADNC cross-sectionally rather than longitudinally which is not surprising since cross-sectional measures of tau capture everything that happened up until the time of the baseline scan, while longitudinal measures capture only what happened in the following year.

Trends for regional differences in rates of accumulation in the AD-related regions were observed between the high-ADNC and low-ADNC groups, with greater rates of tau accumulation in high-ADNC, although these differences did not reach significance. This could have been in part due to lower power with the smaller low-ADNC group or less likely because of the greater relative burden of AD pathology observed in the low-ADNC group compared to the amount observed in the FTLD group (Braak NFT stage being 3.0 versus 2.5). Notably, differences in longitudinal rate of accumulation were observed in the precentral cortex with high-ADNC having higher rates of tau accumulation than FTLD and low-ADNC. Indeed, longitudinal rate of uptake in the precentral cortex ROI is excellent at discriminating between high-ADNC and low-ADNC. Only the FTLD-Meta-ROI as a longitudinal marker showed good, but not excellent, discriminating power to separate FTLD from low-ADNC.

We created a simple ratio of midbrain-to-inferior temporal SUVR to determine whether sensitivity and specificity to differentiate FTLD from ADNC could be improved by accounting for both an FTLD and AD-related region. This simple ratio was determined to be the best when applied to the baseline cohort and was superior to the AD-Meta-ROI and all others in separating FTLD from high-ADNC. Therefore, if we had to select one measure to help separate FTLD from AD, it would be a ratio of midbrain/inferior temporal ROI. Unfortunately, the ratio provided little benefit as a longitudinal measure further confirming the superiority of baseline measures over longitudinal change in tau PET. A more complex ratio of FTLD-Meta-ROI/AD-Meta ROI did not perform any better than the simple ratio with the exception of maybe differentiating FTLD from low-ADNC.

Our FTLD cohort consisted predominantly of FTLD-tau cases, mainly with 4R tau, with only six participants with FTLD-TDP. Hence, our findings regarding differences between FTLD and ADNC will likely generalize better to FTLD-tau than FTLD-TDP cohorts. In fact, the results did not change when we removed these six FTLD-TDP participants. This is not necessarily a limitation to our study as FTLD-tau is more commonly associated with sporadic FTLD syndromes than FTLD-TDP where mutations in the progranulin (GRN) and C9ORF72 genes account for a significant percentage of bvFTD cases with FTLD-TDP pathology. This would also explain why flortaucipir uptake in subcortical regions were found to be the most affected in cases of sporadic bvFTD24.

Our study was not designed to determine what is driving the elevated uptake in FTLD. Autoradiographic studies have not found strong evidence for flortaucipir binding directly to 3R tau, 4R tau or TDP-43. Yet, multiple independent studies have reported finding a correlation between flortaucipir uptake and 4R tau burden at autopsy23, 46, 47. It has also been shown that no single 4R tau lesion is driving the correlation48. Possible explanations for ligand uptake include binding to 3R tau, 4R tau and TDP-43, to a tau/TDP-43 related protein, reflecting a process related to neurodegeneration such as inflammation or iron or off target binding. Binding to monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) has been raised but recent evidence did not support MAO-B as a target49. It would also not be expected that MAO-B increases over time in subcortical regions of neurodegeneration.

There are several strengths of our study, including the large number of autopsy-confirmed participants who allowed us to assess the value of flortaucipir as a diagnostic tool in ADNC cases with known Braak NFT stage and beta-amyloid status. Another strength was the utilization of a leading, highly optimized pipeline designed specifically for measuring change in tau PET, rather than more typical approaches. A limitation of the study was that we did not have enough cases to statistically compare FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is also a great deal of uncertainty regarding the biological basis for flortaucipir binding in FTLD cases.

The findings from this study have implications for the clinical utility of flortaucipir PET to differentiate FTLD from ADNC. More work is needed to better understand the variability and biological processes and mechanisms underlying longitudinal flortaucipir changes.

Figure 4: Boxplots of flortaucipir baseline and rates by FTLD subtype (FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP).

Individual baseline flortaucipir SUVR (upper) and rate of change in SUVR (lower) for each FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP participant are shown. The upper and lower “hinges” of the boxplots correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles). The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the highest value that is within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge, where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles. The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the lowest value within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers and plotted as points. Abbreviations: ADNC, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuropathologic changes; FTLD, Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; inf, inferior, ROI, region of interest; TDP, TAR DNA binding protein 43.
