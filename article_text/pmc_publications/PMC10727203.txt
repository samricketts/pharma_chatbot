Pittsburgh compound B ([11C]PiB) was the first broadly applied radiotracer with specificity for amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregates in the brain and has since been established as the gold standard for positron emission tomography (PET) employed for clinical in vivo imaging of Aβ plaques, used for imaging applications of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementia, and other tauopathies. The use of [11C]PiB for routine PET studies is dependent on the production capabilities of each radiochemistry laboratory, subsequently a continuous effort is made to develop suitable and sustainable methods on a variety of auto synthesis platforms.

Here we report a fully automated, multi-step radio synthesis, purification, and reformulation of [11C]PiB for PET imaging using the Trasis AllinOne synthesis unit, a commonly used commercial radiochemistry module. We performed three validation runs to evaluate the reproducibility and to verify that the acceptable criteria were met for the release of clinical-grade [11C]PiB using a Trasis AllinOne auto radiosynthesis unit. Solid phase supported radiolabeling was performed through the capture of precursor (6-OH-BTA-0) on a C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge and subsequent flushing of gaseous [11C]Methyl triflate(MeOTf) through the Sep-Pak for carbon-11 (11C) N-methylation. Starting with 92.5 GBq [11C]CO2, [11C]PiB synthesis was completed in approximately 25 min after cyclotron end of bombardment with an injectable dose &gt;7.0 GBq at end of the synthesis. The radiopharmaceutical product met all quality control criteria and specifications for use in human studies.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive impairment (Jack et al., 2016; Mirra et al., 1991). Furthermore, AD has been associated with 70% of diagnosed dementia cases (Mirra et al., 1991). Aβ plaques in the brain have been identified as key drivers for AD pathogenesis (Tiraboschi et al., 2004). Almost a decade ago, the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for AD neuropathological diagnosis was revised (Hyman et al., 2012; Montine et al., 2012) to include Aβ-immunoreactive plaques assessed according to phases of Aβ deposition (Thal et al., 2002).

These Aβ plaques can be assessed using [11C]PiB PET, a non-invasive, quantitative diagnostic technique, for selective, real-time, in vivo, 3D imaging of biological processes (Kemppainen et al., 2018; Lockhart et al., 2022). A radionuclide, such as 11C (T1/2 = 20.4 min), that emits positrons that produce directly opposing gamma rays is used to computationally render a 3D image. PET has been widely applied in both preclinical and clinical studies to quantify the expression of target protein complexes, such as Aβ plaques, in vivo (Das, 2015; Lodi et al., 2012).

[11C]PiB was the first broadly applied radiotracer with specificity for Aβ aggregates in humans and has shown high affinity and selectivity for Aβ plaques and other Aβ containing lesions (Cohen et al., 2012; Herholz et al., 2007; Mathis et al., 2003), with fast uptake and low non-specific binding (Buccino et al., 2019). Mathis et al. first reported the production and potential use of the Aβ PET imaging radiotracer in 2003, then referred to in short-hand as [11C]6-OH-BTA-1 and with full chemical name of [N-methyl-11C]2-(4′-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (Mathis et al., 2003) and was later renamed as Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). The first clinical [11C]PiB PET study was published only a year later, providing quantitative information on Aβ plaques and proving the radiotracer’s efficacy in AD diagnosis (Klunk et al., 2004).

The three synthons commonly used for [11C]PiB synthesis are [11C] CO2, [11C]Methyl Iodide (MeI) or [11C]MeOTf, with slight site-specific optimizations or adaptations, depending on the auto synthesis unit(s) and the desired amount of activity (Buccino et al., 2019; Clemente et al., 2012; Coliva et al., 2015; Liger et al., 2015; Philippe et al., 2011; Shao et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2004).

The original method used [11C]MeI as the synthon; a methoxymethyl protected alcohol group on the precursor is later removed through acid hydrolysis (Mathis et al., 2003). The synthesis was optimized using the more reactive [11C]MeOTf in a one-step reaction where there was no need to protect the alcohol group (Wilson et al., 2004). The reaction methodology was referred to as the “loop methylation method” because the radiolabeling reaction took place inside a preparative HPLC injection loop before subsequent HPLC purification (Ono et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2004). The use of [11C]MeOTf as the N-methylation agent in the loop method is crucial because it is less volatile and thus more easily trapped in small volumes of solvent compared to [11C]MeI (Jewett, 1992). The [11C]MeOTf bubbling method, captured in chilled acetone, before radiolabeling at 80 °C for a high yielding (44%) reaction was reported a year later (Solbach et al., 2005).

The loop reaction or captive-solvent method involves a normethyl precursor (0.4 mg of 6-OH-BTA-0) dissolved in solvent (80 μL dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or methyl ethyl ketone (MEK)) loaded onto the preparative HPLC injection loop (2 mL). A stream of nitrogen gas was subsequently used to carry gaseous [11C] MeOTf through the normethyl precursor coated loop at room temperature. Radioactivity captured was monitored by using a proximal γ-detector, when a plateau in was observed N2 flow was stopped, and the loop switched to the inject position which transfers the contents onto the HPLC purification column (Gomez-Vallejo and Llop, 2011; Ono et al., 2003; Verdurand et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2000, 2004). The work described here uses a similar captive-solvent radiolabeling method where the precursor is captured on a C18 Sep-Pak prior to in situ [11C] MeOTF N-methylation. The literature reports a similar cartridge supported and cassette-based methylation synthesis, although a separate auto-synthesis module was used to prepare [11C]MeOTF that was then transferred for in situ 6-OH-BTA-0 radiolabeling (Boudjemeline et al., 2017). Boudjemeline et al. reported a Sep-Pak separation of [11C]PiB from the precursor and radio impurities using precisely prepared wash solvents negating the use of prep-HPLC.

The “wet method” for [11C]MeI production i.e., LiAlH4 is reacted with [11C]CO2 to form [11C]MeO−/[11C]MeOH prior to addition of hydroidic acid (HI) yielding [11C]MeI (Cheung and Ho, 2009; Clemente et al., 2012; Dannals and Langstrom, 1985). When [11C]MeI was passed through a column containing graphitized carbon impregnated with 50% weight silver triflate heated to 200 °C a good yield of [11C]MeOTf is formed (Jewett, 1992).

More recently, investigators reported utilizing [11C]CO2 directly from the cyclotron bubbled into a reaction mixture containing PhSiH3/TBAF or ZnCl2/IPr/PhSiH3 catalysts negating the yield reducing, multistep synthon preparation reactions to form [11C]MeI or [11C] MeOTf (Buccino et al., 2019; Liger et al., 2015).

The Trasis AllinOne auto synthesis unit is mostly applied for fluorine-18(18F) radiotracer productions used for routine clinical PET scans. Our group has previously reported on the use of this module for 11C-radiotracer productions such as [11C]acetoacetate and [11C]acetate radiolabeling from [11C]CO2 (Sai et al., 2017; Sai et al., 2017) as well as (S)-[11C]LY2795050 from [11C]HCN (Sai et al., 2016). This work reported the use of [11C]MeOTf as synthon for [11C]PiB synthesis on the Trasis AllinOne platform employing a single disposable cassette. Although other kit-based synthesis procures for [11C]PiB have been reported, this work reports on the first single cassette-based and auto-synthesis unit production procedure for [11C]PiB with specific activity suitable for clinical application.

2. Methods and materials

2.1. General

All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich, ABX, Trasis and Fisher Scientific) and used without further purification. Cassettes (11C-MeOTf Methylations, Ref# 17778) and reagent kits (11C-MeOTf Methylations Ref# 17912) were purchased from Trasis Inc (Tucker, GA). The PiB reference standard (6-OH-BTA-1 hydrochloride; catalog# 5120) and PiB precursor (6-OH-BTA-0; catalog# 5101) were purchased from ABX (Radeberg, Germany). All the reagents, solvents and consumables meet FDA specifications for producing radiotracers to be used in human studies. The Department of Radiology’s (Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, Winston-Salem) cyclotron, the PETtrace 800 (GE Medical Systems) was used to produce [11C]CO2 via the 14N(p,α)11C nuclear reaction through proton bombardment of nitrogen gas containing 1.0% oxygen, procured from Linde LLC (Whitsett, NC). The irradiation was performed with a beam of 16.5 MeV at 60 μA current for 25 min. After the irradiation process was complete, the resulting [11C]CO2 was delivered to the Trasis AllinOne auto synthesis unit (Trasis, Belgium). The synthon ([11C] MeOTf) and subsequently [11C]PiB were produced on the same fully automated cassette-based synthesis procedure on the Trasis AllinOne, refer to Scheme 1.

2.2. Automated radiochemical synthesis of [11C]MeOTf and [11C]PiB

Before starting the [11C]PiB synthesis, the cassette was loaded, and the reagents and solvent placed as represented in Fig. 2, except for the precursor, all reagents on the cassette were acquired from Trasis Inc.

Prior to the end of bombardment, the 6-OH-BTA-0 (1.0 mg) precursor was dissolved in acetone (0.5 mL), homogenized thoroughly and loaded onto the C18 Sep-Pak. The residual acetone was dried under a stream of argon at 55 °C for 1.5 min under low pressure and another 1.5 min under higher pressure (1 bar). The C18 Sep-Paks were conditioned with absolute ethanol (5 mL) followed by sterile water (5 mL).

The cyclotron produced [11C]CO2 was captured on 4 Å molecular sieves, and total activity recorded by a proximal radiodetector. An average of 92.5 GBq [11C]CO2 was captured, then thermally desorbed (200 °C) and bubbled through a tetrahydrofuran (THF) LiAlH4 (1 mL; 0.1 M) solution yielding [11C]MeO−/[11C]MeOH in reactor #1. After the evaporation of THF at 85 °C under vacuum and argon flow, HI (1 mL; 57%aq.) was added to reactor #1, producing [11C]CH3I after 1.2 min at 100 °C. [11C]CH3I was distilled at 120 °C in a stream of argon and purified by an ascarite and P2O5 trap before passing through the silver triflate column placed in reactor #2 to yield [11C]MeOTf. A proximal radiodetector was used to assess the completion of the distillation process. The gaseous [11C]MeOTf was passed through the C18 Sep-Pak containing the trapped precursor for methylation at 65 °C using an additional Sep-Pak heater. After the maximal amount of [11C]MeOTf was transferred, monitored by another proximal radiodetector, the reaction was continued for an additional 50 s. The C18 Sep-Pak was eluted with of 60% acetonitrile; 40% water (8 mL) and injected into the HPLC, fitted with a 10 mL injection loop, for chromatographic purification (Waters XBridge BEH Shield RP18 OBD Prep Column, 130 Å, 5 μm, 10 × 250 mm). Refer to Fig. 1 for a typical semi prep-HPLC chromatogram. [11C]PiB was eluted with mobile phase consisting of 60% acetonitrile; 40% water at a flow rate of 8 mL/min and UV wavelength set to 254 nm. From approximately 4.5 to 5 min (Fig. 1), the product peak was collected into a vial (labeled HPLC fraction on Fig. 2) and diluted with sterile water (22 mL).

2.3. [11C]PiB formulation

The final radiotracer was formulated for injection using standardized SPE formulation methodology. In short, the water diluted [11C]PiB containing HPLC fraction was passed through a second C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Red SPE’s on Fig. 2), trapping the radiotracer while the water-diluted mobile phase passed through to the waste, the trapped final product activity was tracked with a proximal radiodetector. The C18 Sep-Pak was rinsed with sterile water (9 mL) passed to the waste and then eluted with absolute ethanol (1.0 mL) passed to the final product vial through a 0.22 μm filter (Millex 33 mm PVDF Filter). The eluted product was diluted with sterile saline, passed through the C18 Sep-Pak and 0.22 μm filter into the final product vial. The saline was delivered in two fractions of 6 and 8 mL respectively. Compressed argon was pushed through the C18 Sep-Pak and 0.22 μm filter to ensure a maximum amount of liquid residue was pushed to the final product vial. The resulting final injectable [11C]PiB product thus has a concentration of &lt;10% v/v ethanol (total final volume of 14 ± 1 mL).

As a result of passing the eluted [11C]PiB ethanol fraction through the filter first, followed by saline in two separate fractions (6 and 8 mL) only a minor portion (&lt;3%) of radioactivity was left behind on the membrane filter.

2.4. Quality control (QC) of the [11C]PiB radiopharmaceutical

Conventional methods and Quality Control (QC) tests as described in United States Pharmacopia (USP) chapter&lt;823&gt; Positron Emission Tomography Drugs were used to ensure that the synthesized [11C]PiB radiopharmaceutical met the required specifications for clinical use.

2.4.1. Visual inspection and pH value

Visual inspection confirmed that the [11C]PiB final product was clear, colorless, and free of particulate matter. The final product’s pH was confirmed by applying small amounts directly onto a Ricca chemical pH test strip (pH-0–14) and visually color matching the wetted pH strip with the scale provided.

2.4.2. HPLC analysis

Radiotracer identity was confirmed by analytical HPLC (Agilent 1260 Infinity) fitted with a FlowCountPRO – HPLC Remote Radiation Detection Unit (Eckert &amp; Ziegler, Berlin, Germany). After performing the straight radiotracer injection, the radiochemical identify was authenticated by a co-injection with nonradioactive PiB standard (ABX) dissolved in ethanol. The associated PiB concentration was measured against a standard calibration curve of cold PiB standard (6-OH-BTA-Me) with the UV detector set to 350 nm. The QC radio-HPLC column (Altima C18 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) was eluted with a 1 mL/min isocratic flow rate of 60% acetonitrile/40% 0.1 M aqueous ammonium formate buffer (pH 4.5) mobile phase. The radiochemical purity was &gt;99% for all three [11C]PiB runs, with a retention time of ~5.2 min, refer to Fig. 3 for an example QC HPLC chromatogram.

2.4.3. Residual solvent analysis

Residual solvents were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) flame ionization detector (FID; Agilent 7890B) in accordance with USP general chapter &lt;467&gt;. A DW-WAX (Agilent technologies, 30 m × 0.530 mm × 1 μm) column starting at 45 °C and ramped up to 200 °C in 10.33 min run (15 °C/min) resulted in suitable chromatography. Parameters include the FID temperature set to 300 °C, air flow of 300 mL/min, H2 gas flow set to 40 mL/min and He makeup gas added at 25 mL/min. A flow rate of 2.588 mL/min He (2 psi) was maintained throughout the column.

2.4.4. Endotoxin and sterility testing

The sterile final product vial was prepared, and the QC sample extracted in a bio safety cabinet (ISO class 5) to ensure a sterile final product. The final product vial assembly included two 0.22 μm membrane filters, one to filter the final product and one on the vent needle.

Bacterial endotoxin tests, assessed by the cartridge method (Charles River Laboratories Inc., USA) was performed to ensure that all three [11C]PiB doses contained &lt;175 endotoxin units (EU) per total dose volume (USP&lt;85&gt;, 2003). Thioglycolate and tryptic soy broths were directly inoculated with [11C]PiB final product (0.1 mL) after a suitable decay period and incubated at 25 and 35 °C, respectively, for 14 days per supplier recommendations. Tryptic soy agar (TSA) touch plates were used to verify both dispensing surface and glove sterility during sterile product preparation. TSA settle plates were placed in the biosafety cabinet during sterile final product vial assembly and dosing as a semi-quantitative determination of microbial contamination in the air. Both plate types were incubated at 35 °C for 48 h, as per supplier recommendations.

2.4.5. Filter integrity testing

Final filter membrane integrity was tested using the standard bubble-point method (Hayashi et al., 2014). Briefly, the 0.22 μm membrane filter was removed from the final product vial and attached to a fresh needle. With the needle tip submerged in water, a regulator was used to increase argon pressure to rupture the filter. The associated argon pressure at which the filter ruptured was recorded as the ‘bubble point’. Only the 0.22 μm membrane filter used to filter the [11C]PiB product was tested for integrity, not the vent filter.

2.4.6. Radionuclide identity

A dose calibrator (CRC®–55tR, Capintec, Florham Park, NJ) confirmed the radionuclidic identity by half-life determination to the established half-life of 11C (i.e., measured t1/2 = 20.3 min ±10%).

2.4.7. Stability testing

The stability of the final [11C]PiB was evaluated at 1, 2 and 20 h intervals after the end of synthesis through visual inspection and HPLC-UV analysis of it radiochemical purity. No new UV peaks were observed in any of the stability runs indicating no byproduct formation. The radiochemical purity remained &gt;90% for the 1 and 2 h interval tests for all three runs, indicating a stable radiochemical product.

3. Results and discussion

Three consecutive [11C]PiB syntheses were successfully performed meeting all quality specifications, without any deviation(s), serving as validation runs prior to clinical application. Starting with 94.7 ± 1.5 GBq [11C]CO2, [11C]PiB synthesis was completed in approximately 25 min (24–27min) after the end of bombardment with an injectable dose of 9.3 ± 1.6 GBq (refer to Table 1). If needed, the total yield was sufficient for serve two consecutive clinical PET scans (factoring in the time needed for QC tests and uptake). The total PiB mass averaged 46.9 ± 16.5 μg per batch with a specific activity of 57 ± 18 GBq/μmol. The average non-decay-corrected yield using the Trasis method was 9.8 ± 1.7% (calculated from trapped [11C]CO2). The total synthesis time was ~25 min, including the transfer and trapping of [11C]CO2, synthesis of [11C]MeOTf, radiochemical labeling, HPLC purification and reformulation of the final product dose. The total synthesis time compares well, or is faster than recently literature examples for [11C]PiB synthesis, 32 min (Buccino et al., 2019); 20 min (Boudjemeline et al., 2017); 30min (Coliva et al., 2015); 25–30 min (Clemente et al., 2012). It should be noted, the fastest reported synthesis method, of 20 min, did not include preparative HPLC, but rather employed only SPE purification with highly specific wash and elution fractions of up to 92 ml (Boudjemeline et al., 2017).

Table 1 contains a summary of the three consecutive validation runs performed on the Trasis AllinOne demonstrating high repeatability and suitability for clinical application. All three runs adhere to all the specified criteria required before the radiotracer can be used for human PET scans as per the United States Pharmacopia (USP&lt;823&gt;, 2011).

The specific activity, BET and PiB mass limits reported in Table 1 correspond to the IAEA representative QC examples that included [11C] PiB (Ballinger et al., 2018).

The use of disposable cassettes allows for a fast reset time between runs allowing for multiple [11C]PiB productions in a day. The hot cassette can be removed and stored separately for radio decay allowing for safe disposal later, meaning minimal cleaning time is required between runs. The Trasis AllinOne also can remotely empty the waste container to a secondary, larger, container outside the hot cell providing further options to limit exposure of the radiochemist during consecutive run setup. Further, the single use cassettes are amenable to regulatory guidelines for clinical use (Boudjemeline et al., 2017).

An additional advantage of this [11C]PiB Trasis AllinOne kit method is that [11C]MeOTf was produced on the same cassette, negating the use of two auto synthesis units where [11C]MeOTf has to be synthesized on one unit and transferred to another unit for use in radiolabeling. This approach can free up valuable lab space and hot cells that could be used for other applications or additional productions.

4. Conclusion

We successfully validated a dependable procedure for automated production of [11C]PiB in our current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) production facility. Specifically, we demonstrated that the Trasis AllinOne method can be used with commercially available cassettes and reagent kits to produce clinical grade [11C]PiB. The synthetic Trasis AllinOne method was validated under cGMP conditions through three validation runs that met specific activity, radiochemical purity, and UPS 823 requirements for human administration. Our validation confirmed that the Trasis AllinOne method for producing [11C]PiB aligns well with all the necessary regulations for use in humans.

Benefits of the [11C]PiB Trasis AllinOne method include a short fully automated synthesis time and disposable cassettes allowing for a fast reset time between runs allowing for multiple runs in short succession making this method highly compatible with routine production of [11C] PiB. Additionally [11C]MeOTf was produced on the same cassette, negating the use of two auto synthesis units. The Trasis AllinOne has been widely distributed and is used routinely at many PET centers to produce radiotracers for clinical use making this [11C]PiB synthesis procedure very applicable for potential routine clinical use in the future.
