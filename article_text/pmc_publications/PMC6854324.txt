While iron has an important role in the normal functioning of the brain due to its involvement in several physiological processes, dyshomeostasis has been found in many neurodegenerative disorders, as evidenced by both histopathological and imaging studies. Although the exact causes have remained elusive, the fact that altered iron levels have been found in disparate diseases suggests that iron may contribute to their development and/or progression. As such, the processes involved in iron dyshomeostasis may represent novel therapeutic targets. There are, however, many questions about the exact interplay between neurodegeneration and altered iron homeostasis. Some insight can be gained by considering the parallels with respect to what occurs in healthy aging, which is also characterized by increased iron throughout many regions in the brain along with progressive neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of iron-mediated damage are likely disease-specific to a certain degree, given that iron plays a crucial role in many disparate biological processes, which are not always affected in the same way across different neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, it is not even entirely clear yet whether iron actually has a causative role in all of the diseases where altered iron levels have been noted. For example, there is strong evidence of iron dyshomeostasis leading to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease, but there is still some question as to whether or not changes in iron concentrations are merely an epiphenomenon in multiple sclerosis. Recent advances in neuroimaging now offer the possibility to detect and monitor iron levels in vivo, which allows for an improved understanding of both the temporal and spatial dynamics of iron changes and associated neurodegeneration compared to post-mortem studies. In this regard, iron-based imaging will likely play an important role in the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing altered iron dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. As of now, the bulk of such therapies have focused on chelating excess iron. Although there is some evidence that these treatment options may yield some benefit, they are not without their own limitations. They are generally effective at reducing brain iron levels, as assessed by imaging, but clinical benefits are more modest. New drugs that specifically target iron-related pathological processes may offer the possibility to prevent, or at the least slow down, irreversible neurodegeneration, which represents an as of yet unmet therapeutic target.

Graphical Abstract


1. Introduction

Iron plays a crucial role in the brain due to its role in several physiological processes including myelin synthesis, neurotransmitter production, oxygen transport, and mitochondrial functioning. [1–3] Cerebral free iron must be carefully regulated as deviations in available iron can lead to detrimental effects, ultimately resulting in tissue damage. In fact, physiological brain aging is generally associated with iron dyshomeostasis and tissue loss, processes which are linked together [3]. Several neurological disorders characterized by neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [4], Parkinson disease (PD) [5], and multiple sclerosis (MS) [6], have also been found to have altered brain iron levels compared to the healthy population. The association between neurodegeneration and iron dyshomeostasis is further evidenced in some rare genetic diseases, grouped together under the term “neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation” (NBIA), as they are all characterized by iron deposits within the basal ganglia, cortex and cerebellum along with tissue loss [7].

Until about two decades ago, insight into the role of iron in neurodegenerative diseases was primarily gained from post-mortem studies involving histochemical analysis. However, the advent of iron-sensitive imaging techniques has opened the door to the possibility of assessing iron in vivo [8–10]. While a detailed description of the different imaging modalities is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, a brief overview is provided in Table 1.

Although clear progress has been made in understanding how iron dyshomeostasis can impact the brain along with its relationship to clinical outcomes [11–13], many questions still remain unanswered. There is still much to learn regarding the spatial and temporal dynamics of iron changes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These issues are complicated by iron having a crucial role in many disparate biological processes, which are not affected in the same way across different diseases. Consequently, traditional iron-based chelation therapies, while being generally effective in reducing brain iron content, are characterized by a relatively low clinical efficacy [14–16]. Taken together, more-specific approaches for modifying iron-related processes potentially represent unmet therapeutic targets for the development of novel pharmaceutical compounds.

In this article, we will first describe the general pathophysiology of iron in the brain and neurodegenerative disorders. We will then detail how iron may contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases and the role of imaging in monitoring brain iron. Finally, we will assess potential therapies aimed towards targeting iron dyshomeostasis.

2. Brain iron from physiology to pathology

Until recently, it was thought that iron enters the brain primarily with the aid of transferrin (Tf) receptors (TfR) found on microvascular endothelial cells [17], which are the major component of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). However, recent evidence suggests that T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin receptor 1 (Tim-1) acts as a receptor for ferritin on brain endothelial cells [18]. In this regard, ferritin might be an equally important or even more important iron source for many cell types, especially oligodendrocytes, which express Tim-1 but not TfR [19].

Considering that both iron excess and deficiency are detrimental, iron levels within the brain are tightly regulated and vary according to cellular needs [20]. Under normal conditions, intracellular iron is either transported into mitochondria for energy production, or remains available for short-term needs/immediate use in the labile iron pool or, alternatively, is stored within ferritin [21]. Export of iron occurs through ferroportin channels, upon demand, and iron is carried within the brain interstitial fluid either as Tf-bound or as non-transferrin-bound iron [22, 2]. Iron is involved in many essential biochemical processes in cells, such as ATP production, [23] DNA synthesis and repair [24]. Iron is also necessary for the normal functioning of neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia [25]. However, accumulation of free iron may ultimately favor cell toxicity and death when critical levels are reached [26].

The healthy aging brain is characterized by several changes that can lead to higher iron concentrations. First, increased BBB permeability in the elderly, in conjunction with weaker vessel walls, might facilitate microhemorrhages and extravasation of red blood cells into the brain parenchyma [27]. Circulating immune cells may also leak into brain tissue, contributing to the maintenance of a mild, persistent inflammatory state [28]. Although microglia act to limit the availability of extracellular metal, and consequently the level of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2], neuronal iron accumulation cannot be entirely prevented. Microglial senescence, with reduced efficacy of their protective functions, has also been proposed as a mechanism that partially contributes to neurodegeneration [29]. Finally, intracellular repair mechanisms are less effective in the aging brain, in part due to a reduced capacity to counteract oxidative stress [30–33].

Both histopathological [34] and MRI studies [3, 35] have found iron accumulation throughout the deep gray matter as well as the cortex over the lifetime. There is an apparent selective involvement of some cell types during aging, such as astrocytes, neurons and microglia, whereas oligodendrocytes, which harbor the largest amount of iron, do not show age-related increases in corresponding concentrations [36]. Iron is also distributed differently among iron-related proteins due to normal aging, with increased Tf-iron complexes in astrocytes, [36] increased microglial ferritin-positive subpopulations and increased neuronal neuromelanin-iron complexes within the substantia nigra (SN) [37].

Some evidence suggests that brain physiological senescence and neurodegeneration are a continuum of the same spectrum, where genetic and environmental risk factors might be determinant in shifting towards overt pathology [30, 32, 38]. Histopathological studies of brain tissue from cognitively unimpaired, elderly donors have demonstrated deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau as well as α-synuclein, which are hallmarks of AD and PD, respectively [38, 39]. Abnormal iron levels, detected in both aging and neurodegenerative diseases, may contribute in damaging neural cells through the generation of toxic ROS (in the case of free iron), [40] the release of glial proinflammatory substances [41], and the impairment of DNA repair mechanisms [24], ultimately facilitating cellular ferroptosis and neuronal apoptosis [37, 38, 30].

An important distinction needs to be made regarding bound versus free (or labile) iron. Ferritin-sequestered iron is generally incapable of participating in the putative iron-mediated neurodegenerative pathways. Free iron plays an important role in normal physiological functioning, changing between ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+) states due to its redox potential. This very fact though also results in free iron as potentially contributing to neurodegeneration. Ferrous iron and hydrogen peroxide participate in the Fenton reaction, whereby ferric iron, a hydroxyl anion and a ROS hydroxyl radical are produced. In turn, the ferric ion is possibly reduced back to the ferrous state, either via amyloid [42] or the Haber Weiss reaction. It is likely that ferrous and ferric iron have somewhat different profiles with respect to associated pathological behavior. For example, elevated ferric iron levels result in the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau while reduction to the ferrous state leads to its decrease [43]. Differential associations of the two states are also supported by the finding of a shift towards increased ferric iron concentrations in the substantia nigra of PD [44]. Finally, it should be noted that despite the implication of free iron as having a more direct role in iron-mediated neurodegeneration, increased ferritin levels have also been found in neurodegenerative disorders such as AD and PD [45, 46], which would be consistent with a greater bioavailability of free iron [47].

3. Alzheimer’s disease

AD is the most common form of dementia in the elderly [48]. The histological hallmarks of the disease are extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles with hyperphosphorylated tau protein [49, 50]. Iron seems to have a role in the pathogenesis of AD [3]. First, the main component of the amyloid plaques is Aβ peptide, a product of the proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is in turn a cellular membrane protein whose function is to stabilize ferroportin and as such participates in iron transcellular efflux [51, 52]. Second, the highest concentrations of amyloid plaques have been found in regions characterized by marked vascular degeneration, where Aβ colocalizes with the heme-portion of hemoglobin [53, 54]. Aβ may initially serve to sequester excess heme-iron in an attempt to reduce its potential to exert neurotoxic effects [33]. Higher levels of heme/hemoglobin are a common finding in the brain of AD patients, likely due in part to abnormally increased BBB permeability [55, 56]. Moreover, the pathogenic role of iron in AD is indirectly sustained considering that AD pathology is more severe in temporal cortical regions, where non-heme iron concentrations are among the lowest throughout the cortex under physiological conditions [57]. Therefore, these brain regions are likely less equipped with the required mechanisms in maintaining iron balance, rendering the areas more sensitive to iron excess [56].

Recent MRI studies further support the importance of iron in the pathogenesis of AD [58, 59]. A QSM study showed a significant association between hippocampal iron load and accelerated decline in several cognitive domains only in patients with amyloid pathology [58]. Using phase MRI, another study showed higher iron content both in the BG and hippocampus of AD patients with respect to healthy controls, and highlighted the association of hippocampal iron levels with cognitive performance and disease duration [59].

In conjunction with iron deposition, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are also typical features of AD [60]. Neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to accumulation of ROS and intracellular free iron, subsequently enhancing the production of APP, and consequently of Aβ, favoring plaque formation. In turn, this process attracts scavenging microglial cells which then maintain an inflammatory milieu, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration [60].

4. Parkinson’s disease

PD is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extrapyramidal motor symptoms associated with non-motor problems, such as sleep disorders, autonomic and cognitive dysfunctions. Experimental finding of striatal degeneration in neonatal mice fed with iron [61] and the improvement of such symptoms with iron-chelation therapy [62–64] suggest a crucial role for iron in the pathogenesis of PD.

Increased iron levels have been found in the SN of PD patients, both ex vivo [65] and in vivo, using different instrumental techniques [66–69]. A QSM study of whole-brain and several regions of interests, reported high susceptibility values compatible with iron deposition not only within the SN but also in the rostral pontine areas and in the cortex, with a distribution pattern consistent with known histological findings [70]. Furthermore, iron is related to both the histopathological hallmarks of PD, the loss of neuromelanin (NM)-containing neurons in the SN pars compacta and the formation of α-synuclein aggregates [71].

Greater iron levels and the subsequent production of ROS likely cause degeneration of dopaminergic neurons [63] and are involved in dopamine oxidation [72], which may then trigger production of toxic species responsible for further neuronal degeneration [5]. It has also been proposed that the breakdown of dopamine itself leads to further damage, given that the resulting byproducts are highly neurotoxic [72]. The harmful consequence of reduced dopaminergic NM-containing neuronal capacity is further highlighted by the role of NM itself, which acts as an intracellular iron-binder. In PD patients, both the reduced availability of NM and its impaired ability to bind iron [73] may lead to increased free iron and iron-derived toxic reactive molecules.

Intraneuronal inclusions of a-synuclein are also a pathological hallmark of PD. The exact roles that α-synuclein has in the healthy brain is unknown. There is evidence of its involvement in iron homeostasis due to post-translational changes of α-synuclein having an effect on endocytic import of iron [74]. Nevertheless, similarly to the Aβ deposits found in AD, α-synuclein might initially have a protective role against iron related neurotoxicity [75]. Experimental evidence suggests that iron-derived toxic products are also involved in α-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress leading to neurodegeneration [64, 74, 76].

5. Multiple sclerosis

MS affects several functional systems, resulting in complex clinical pictures with motor, sensory, cerebellar and cognitive symptoms. MS pathology involves both the WM and GM tissue compartments and is characterized by focal demyelinating lesions along with more subtle, widespread tissue damage.

Iron likely plays a role in maintaining a chronic state of inflammation and contributing to neurodegeneration [77]. Iron dynamics are altered in MS, with histological and MRI evidence of reduced iron content within active lesions and normal appearing WM (NAWM) (i.e. areas of WM without focal lesions) [78–80] and increased iron levels in both chronic lesions (Figure 1) and at the borders of active ones [77, 79, 81]. A possible explanation for these findings is that, as a consequence of plaque formation, macrophages/microglia infiltrate the damaged tissue, scavenge damaged myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes, which subsequently release iron into the extracellular space [82], generating ROS and further amplifying cellular damage. Increased iron content in the rim of chronic lesions may also be in part tied to a state of virtual hypoxia following ongoing inflammation and consequent upregulation of processes that result in cell iron influx [80]. Microglia, likewise, contribute to perpetuating neuroinflammation through the release of proinflammatory cytokines, in turn favoring demyelination, neuronal and oligodendrocytic damage [83]. Over time, the inflammatory milieu may potentially result in the disappearance of oligodendrocytes from NAWM as neurons do within the cortex, resulting in reduced brain iron content [80]. On the other hand, with respect to the deep GM, the BG consistently show increased iron concentrations [12, 84–86] whereas there have been reports of both increased [86] and decreased thalamic iron content in MS. [87, 12, 88] Considering the relatively high perfusion in the BG and findings showing a correlation between iron levels within the globus pallidus and serum [84], elevated blood-brain iron translocation through BBB might play a role in BG iron accumulation. The presence of cerebral microbleeds in the BG of MS patients, and general lack of them within the thalamus [89], also supports the theory of blood extravasation as a possible contributor to iron accumulation.

Discrepancies with respect to the thalamic iron levels in MS are likely explained in part by differences in patient characteristics across studies. It is known that thalamic iron content follows an “inverted U” pattern with respect to age in healthy individuals [34]. In this context, decreased thalamic iron in MS patients may reflect the far end of the “healthy aging to pathological” continuum previously mentioned. In other words, the process(es) that result in decreased thalamic iron in elderly, but otherwise healthy, subjects may potentially be exacerbated in the MS brain. One potential explanation is that the proinflammatory milieu causes oligodendrocytes, of which the thalamus has a relatively high amount, to emit iron. The released iron may then cause further damage via the generation of ROS before microglia can scavenge it. The clearing of iron would subsequently induce the microglia to release additional proinflammatory cytokines, thereby resulting in a positive feedback loop leading to a progressive reduction of iron-rich neurons and oligodendrocytes [87].

6. Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)

NBIA is a term that encompass different genetically determined rare disorders characterized by iron deposits within globus pallidus and SN along with generalized cerebral atrophy, and a clinical picture dominated by cognitive and motor dysfunctions associated with ophthalmological problems [90]. Histologically, iron deposits are mostly found in neurons and astrocytes, whereas oligodendrocytes seem to be spared [91]. Interestingly, the genetic defects involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases are mostly associated with mitochondrial activities and lipid metabolism while alterations in only two genes affect proteins directly related to iron homeostasis, namely ceruloplasmin and ferritin light chain [92]. While it is not yet clear why NBIA disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction should result in iron deposition, a potential link between mitochondrial functioning and altered heme iron metabolism has been proposed [93].

7. The role of imaging in monitoring iron-related changes in neurodegenerative disorders

The advent of imaging, particularly with regards to MRI, has played a key role in providing insight into the role that iron has in nearly all neurodegenerative disorders. While the vast majority of studies investigating iron in neurodegenerative disorders are cross-sectional in nature, a number of recent reports have demonstrated the utility of iron-sensitive MRI in determining the temporal and spatial dynamics of iron accumulation.

Two recent studies of PD patients found distinct patterns of iron accumulation within the SN using R2* and QSM imaging [11, 94]. Specifically, Du et al. found on the one hand that although iron levels were higher in the SN pars compacta in all PD patient subgroups, as determined by disease duration, a significantly greater rate of increase over 18 months was only found in later-stage patients, which also correlated with non-motor symptoms of the disease. On the other hand, SN pars reticulata iron decreased significantly over the follow-up in this same subgroup of patients, which was associated with changes in motor signs [11]. In the study by Bergsland et al. [94], significant increases in iron content were found in the ventral posterior SN, but not in the dorsal SN, in PD patients over the course of about 3 years (Figure 2). Interestingly, no differences in SN volume were detected in that study, suggesting that iron accumulation is not merely a secondary effect following neuronal loss. Nevertheless, no associations with clinical outcomes were detected in the latter study, possibly due to the fact that all patients were evaluated in the “on” state.

Changes in iron content have also been reported in longitudinal studies of MS. Hagemeier et al. reported that changes in deep GM iron content were similar in patients and healthy controls over 2 years [95]. No associations between iron changes and clinical disability were identified. Moreover, the authors suggested that greater iron concentration over the follow-up in the caudate is a secondary result of atrophy leading to increased density of existing iron stores rather than due to iron deposition, per se. These results are in line with a recent cross-sectional study that indicated structural volume needs to be also accounted for when assessing MRI-derived iron content such that mass, rather than concentration, is analyzed [96]. Indeed, a secondary analysis of the data reported by Hagemeier et al. [95] found that iron mass decreased in all deep GM regions in MS compared to being stable or slightly increasing in healthy controls. Furthermore, decreases in thalamic iron mass were significantly related to significantly increased disability over the 2 years of follow-up [97].

One particular caveat in the interpretation of iron-sensitive MRI needs to be mentioned. While various methods have been proposed (Table 1), there are differences in their overall specificity to iron [98]. Most techniques are also affected not just by iron but also by myelin, calcium and water content. Consequently, although most authors have interpreted their findings in the context of iron-related changes, the actual underlying pathophysiology may end up being more complex. Previous work has shown that specificity can vary based on the specific region of the brain under investigation [99]. Recent studies have attempted to isolate the contributions from iron and myelin/calcium [100, 101], but histological validation of such methods is still lacking. It has also been demonstrated that while ferrous and ferric iron ions are similar in their magnetic susceptibility, they differ with regards to transverse relaxation rate [102], suggesting that their pathological associations can be separately assessed from each another.

In sum, the development of any drug that targets iron-related pathology, either directly or indirectly, will almost certainly incorporate the use of iron-sensitive imaging techniques to monitor changes in iron levels. However, it must be mentioned whether or not such measures can be used at the individual patient level to predict clinical outcomes.

8. Iron treatment strategies and targets

As illustrated in the previous sections, iron dynamics are altered in neurodegenerative processes, albeit in different ways depending on the specific disease. Nevertheless, the histopathological basis and dynamics of iron-related changes remain relatively opaque. Mechanisms associated with iron intake/release [22, 103], transportation [104, 105], and distribution between intracellular/extracellular spaces [80] are key areas that may represent novel therapeutic targets. In this regard however, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding each of these aspects even in healthy subjects, and even more so in individual neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, it is often not entirely clear whether iron changes, either in terms of accumulation or loss, are only an epiphenomenon or if they have a direct causative roles in disease mechanisms. It is likely that which scenario is true depends on the specific disease. As previously discussed, there is ample evidence in the case of AD and PD that iron deposition is not merely a secondary effect, but plays a role in initiating and/or maintaining the neurodegenerative cascade. In MS, there is some evidence that iron accumulation within the DGM may precede structural atrophy in the case of patients with clinically isolated syndrome [106, 107], which represents the first clinical onset of suspected MS. Inflammatory processes, which occur in AD [108], PD [109], and MS [110], also likely contribute to increased iron levels as a result of iron-laden macrophage migration, production of ROS, and ultimately cell death.

The bulk of clinical trials that have investigated treatments to specifically target iron in neurodegenerative disorders have focused on chelation-based approaches. As the body is severely limited in its ability to excrete excess iron, chelation therapy is used to sequester it by binding non-Tf bound iron with the aim to reduce toxic effects of increased iron on neuronal cells [15]. Although chelation therapy has been shown to be relatively effective in reducing iron levels within the brain, its effect on clinical outcomes is less clear. This could be due to a) iron-mediated neurodegenerative damage is irreversible, b) the clinical relevance of iron deposition varies throughout the course of the disease, or c) that it has minimal to no impact on clinical outcomes. Again, which of these possibilities is true likely depends on the nature of the disease.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of the iron chelating agent deferiprone, early PD patients that immediately began treatment had better clinical outcomes and less iron deposition in the SN compared to those in the delayed treatment arm [111]. In a second study involving the same agent, also in early PD, a relatively small significantly reduced iron content was found in the dentate and caudate nucleus compared to placebo, but minimal effects in the SN and only a trend for improved motor and quality of life outcomes [112]. Further evidence for a potential benefit of chelation therapy comes from studies showing that deferiprone can prevent ferroptosis, further supporting a primary role for iron in PD-related neurodegeneration [113]. Interestingly though, a study investigating SN iron levels in post-mortem brain tissue were unrelated to Braak pathological staging (Braak stage V versus VI), suggesting that iron-related changes occur earlier in the disease [114]. Moreover, at the time of PD diagnosis, 30-50% of dopaminergic neurons in the SN pars compacta have already been destroyed [115]. Although increased iron levels are unlikely to be the sole contributor to neurodegeneration, these findings suggest that there is a relatively limited window of opportunity in which iron chelation therapy can provide clear benefits in PD [116], at least with respect to functioning either directly or indirectly related to the SN. In addition to chelation-based approaches, there is some evidence that erythropoietin, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, may have a role in the treatment of PD, as shown in studies involving animals [117] as well as humans [118].

Two trials in AD that investigated chelators effective at removing not only iron but also zinc and copper have also suggested the therapeutic approach may have some benefit in this disease as well. There was evidence of less clinical progression in treated patients compared to the placebo arm [119], and improved scores in two tests assessing executive functioning, although the latter trial was designed to assess drug safety [120].

A limited number of studies have investigated iron chelation therapy in MS, although no clear effects on disease progression have been shown [121, 122]. Despite the lack of strong evidence in the aforementioned trials, the investigated compound, deferiprone, has been shown to modulate the peripheral blood T cell response in humans [123], findings that are corroborated by suppression of disease activity with the same agent in an animal model of MS [124]. However, the therapeutic potential of iron chelation therapy in this disease is complicated by evidence of decreased iron content in the thalamus [87, 88, 96, 101] and possibly of other deep GM structures [96, 101], as well as in the NAWM of MS patients [80]. These findings suggest that iron chelation in MS may have the potential to exacerbate certain aspects of the underlying pathology or impair beneficial processes that require iron such as remyelination. The same principle likely holds for any therapy aimed at targeting iron mechanics in MS.

In terms of NBIA disorders, several case studies described patients affected by aceruloplasminemia that received iron chelation therapy even before the onset of neurological symptoms, and remained asymptomatic for several years [125–127]. Although firm conclusions cannot be drawn from individual case reports, these reports suggest that the associated neurodegeneration typically seen in untreated patients is primarily of an iron-mediated origin. Interestingly though, clinical trials of deferiprone in pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) have also shown promising results with evidence of slower disease progression in treated patients [128, 129], despite the disorder being characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction rather than in genetic defects directly related to iron dyshomeostasis. One possible explanation for these findings is that the reduced bioavailability of iron helps reduce the impact of mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, larger trials with longer periods of follow-up are required to investigate this hypothesis.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that iron chelation may potentially have a role in the treatment of at least some neurodegenerative disorders. However, there are still inherent limitations of such therapeutic approaches in that there are potential side effects, but perhaps more importantly, they are not limited to targeting only the brain. Nevertheless, chelation therapy removes excess iron that is released as a consequence of result of upstream pathology (or possibly part of a vicious cycle of iron release and enhanced neurodegeneration.) In light of this, targeting the processes that result in the accumulation of iron to begin with may be a more attractive strategy.

Given the interactions between proinflammatory cytokines, microglia, iron, and ROS, it is tempting to speculate that inhibiting inflammation may aid in preventing iron dyshomeostasis and subsequent neurodegeneration. Evidence from animal models suggest that anti-inflammatory therapy is neuroprotective in PD [130–132]. Interestingly, memantine and amantadine, which are both used in treating PD, have anti-inflammatory effects [133, 134]. Although trials of drugs specifically targeting inflammation have not yet been found to have a clear beneficial effect for treating PD [135] or AD [136], several potent anti-inflammatory therapies are used to treat MS. While these drugs have considerable efficacy in reducing inflammation, as evidenced by a reduction in relapse rate and prevention of new white matter lesions, their ability to slow down neurodegeneration is markedly less [137]. However, the impact that anti-inflammatory drugs have on cerebral iron dynamics is unknown. On-going low-grade inflammation, despite treatment, may in part sustain the aforementioned iron-mediated chain of events that ultimately leads to neurodegeneration. It must nevertheless be stressed that neuroinflammation plays a beneficial role under certain circumstances. For example, acute inflammation may be necessary for stimulating oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to generate remyelinating oligodendrocytes in MS lesions [138]. Toll-like receptors are also stimulated in the presence of inflammatory cytokines, which subsequently promotes neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth [139]. Thus, drugs aimed at controlling inflammation will need to exert a careful balance between controlling it while not blunting it entirely. Better knowledge regarding the complex immune-signaling pathways will allow for the development of novel treatments aimed at more specific targets.

9. Conclusions

In conclusion, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that iron plays a crucial role in neurodegeneration, with different potential mechanisms that often seem to involve mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. Given the numerous roles that iron has in both normal brain functioning and in maintaining/amplifying ongoing pathological processes, a single approach for targeting iron dyshomeostasis is unlikely to be successful. Additional studies utilizing iron-sensitive MRI, histopathology, and animal models are needed to better characterize the precise role that iron has throughout the different stages of disease. In turn, novel therapies can then hopefully be developed once armed with a clearer understanding of the complex role iron has in neurodegeneration.

Note the rim that is evident on the high pass filtered phase and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) image and to a lesser extent on the R2* image in the case of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patient (56-year-old female with a disease duration of 23.4 years and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 6.5). No such rim is evident in the lesion of the relapsing-remitting patient (43-year-old female with a disease duration of 11.5 years and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3.5) shown in the bottom row. Hyperintense lesion rims are generally more common in patients with a progressive phenotype and are suggestive of chronic inflammation. The core of both lesions is hypointense on the R2* image, which likely reflects loss of myelin.

The grayscale range of the QSM images is between −100 and 200 parts per billion while that of the R2* images is between 0 and 70 hertz.

Magnetic field correlation (MFC)	Quantitative measure utilizing asymmetric spin echoes	Quantitative in nature	Requires use of non-standard imaging sequences; relies on off-line post-processing; not as extensively investigated compared to other iron-sensitive measures	[142–144]	
Phase imaging	Semi-quantitative measure whereby the phase image from a T2*-weighted sequence has been filtered to remove low frequencies	Easily obtained; correlates with histopathological iron assessments; differentiation of calcium and iron is possible	Semi-quantitative in nature; Historical acquisitions often do not have the associated required phase data; may require off-line post-processing	[6, 106, 145]	
Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)	Quantitative measure of magnetic susceptibility derived from phase data in a T2*-weighted sequence (possibly with multiple echoes)	Quantitative in nature; scales linearly with tissue iron concentrations; differentiation of calcium and iron is possible	Historical acquisitions often do not have the required associated phase data; Requires advanced off-line post-processing	[146, 12, 87, 147, 66, 95, 11]	
R2	Quantitative measure of the reciprocal of T2 derived from the magnitude data in a multi-echo T2-weighted sequence	Easily obtained with standard imaging sequences; Quantitative in nature (although dependent on other factors such as field strength and diffusion effects); retrospective analysis of already acquired data is feasible	Differentiation of calcium and iron is not possible; less sensitive to iron than other quantitative techniques (e.g. R2*, QSM); slow acquisition, low resolution	[148, 149]	
R2*	Quantitative measure of the reciprocal of T2*derived from the magnitude data in a multi-echo T2*-weighted sequence	Easily obtained with standard imaging sequences; quantitative in nature (although dependent on other factors such as field strength and diffusion effects); retrospective analysis of already acquired data is feasible	Differentiation of calcium and iron is not possible	[150, 151, 11, 152, 99]	
Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)	Semi-quantitative measure that combines information magnitude and phase images from a T2*-weighted sequence	Easily obtained; differentiation of calcium and iron is possible with reference to corresponding phase image	Semi-quantitative in nature; historical acquisitions often do not have the required associated phase data; may require off-line post-processing	[153, 89]	
T2 hypointensity	Qualitative assessment of T2 intensity	Easily obtained with standard imaging sequences; retrospective analysis of already acquired data is feasible	Qualitative in nature; lack of standardization; lack of histopathological validation; differentiation of calcium and iron is not possible	[154, 155]	
Transcranial sonography ultrasound echogenicity	Qualitative measurement of the acoustic reflectance due to impedance mismatching	Easily obtained; inexpensive	Qualitative in nature; potentially operator dependent; limited to certain structures in the brain (e.g. substantia nigra)	[156, 157]	
Note: All measures are obtained using except for transcranial sonography ultrasound echogenicity.

Key points

Iron dyshomeostasis has been noted in several neurodegenerative disorders.

Iron can be assessed in vivo using advanced imaging techniques.

Targeting iron may represent novel therapeutic targets to prevent or slow down neurodegeneration.
