Previous studies have established that neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a disconnection syndrome, where the neuropathological burdens often propagate across the brain network to interfere with the structural and functional connections. In this context, identifying the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens sheds new light on understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of AD progression. However, little attention has been paid to propagation pattern identification by fully considering the intrinsic properties of brain-network organization, which plays an important role in improving the interpretability of the identified propagation pathways. To this end, we propose a novel harmonic wavelet analysis approach to construct a set of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets, it allows us to characterize the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens from multiple hierarchical modules across the brain network. Specifically, we first extract underlying hub nodes through a series of network centrality measurements on the common brain network reference generated from a population of minimum spanning tree (MST) brain networks. Then, we propose a manifold learning method to identify the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets corresponding to hub nodes by seamlessly integrating the hierarchically modular property of the brain network. We estimate the statistical power of our proposed harmonic wavelet analysis approach on synthetic data and large-scale neuroimaging data from ADNI. Compared with the other harmonic analysis techniques, our proposed method not only effectively predicts the early stage of AD but also provides a new window to capture the underlying hub nodes and the propagation pathways of neuropathological burdens in AD.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is acknowledged as a progressive multifarious neurodegenerative disorder with the leading cause of memory loss, language impairment, disorientation, emotional instability, loss of motivation, and other behavioral problems when people are aging (Kumar et al., 2015; Mattson, 2004). Currently, the biological mechanisms underlying AD are not thoroughly understood, and no effective treatment exists (Stam, 2014). Therefore, accurate prediction of developing AD at its early stage becomes critical in slowing down the progression of AD via the appropriate interventions.

Recent developments in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and network neuroscience allow us to characterize the white matter fiber bundles that connect various grey matter areas in the context of the large-scale brain network (Conturo et al., 1999). Moreover, convergent evidence shows that AD can be understood as a disconnection syndrome where neuropathological processes progressively disrupt the large-scale brain network (Pievani et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016; Sepulcre et al., 2018). Such brain-network changes in AD are manifested much earlier before the onset of clinical symptoms (Araque Caballero et al., 2018; Filippi et al., 2017), indicating that accurately discovering the propagation pathways of neuropathological burdens provides a new window to predict the risk of developing AD at its early phase. In this regard, it is necessary to study the fundamental aspects of the brain-network organization, which can be used to promote the power in identifying the propagation patterns of neuropathological events and better understand the pathophysiological mechanism in AD.

Unlike many other real networks, the brain network generally exhibits properties of small-worldness and free scale, where the human brain is a hierarchical module organization, and hubs connect those modules. The high clustering of connections between nodes in the same module will favor locally segregated processing of specialized functions, while the short path length will support globally integrated processing of more generic functions (Sporns et al., 2004). Firstly, the hub nodes are usually located in the central positions of the network, exhibiting a much higher centrality than other nodes (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013), as shown in red and green nodes in Fig. 1(a). Based on the setting of network modules, hub nodes can be divided into two different categories, provincial hubs and connector hubs. Specifically, provincial hubs are the high-degree nodes that primarily connect to nodes in the same module (red nodes in Fig. 1(a)). Whereas, connector hubs are high-degree nodes that mainly connect to several different modules in the brain network (green nodes in Fig. 1(a)). In addition, emerging evidence shows that neuropathological disruption selectively accumulates at some critical hub regions (Cope et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022). Secondly, hierarchical modularity is a type of network organization where each module in the brain network can be further partitioned into a set of sub-modules, and within each sub-module there may be sub-sub-modules (shown in Fig. 1(b)). And the hierarchical modularity gives the brain network the advantage of greater robustness, adaptivity, and evolvability of network function. Therefore, considering the hierarchical characteristic of the brain network in the developed methods would enhance the performance in identifying the brain-network changes in AD (Huang et al., 2021).

Recently, mounting evidence shows the whole brain network can be summarized as its own Eigensystem, which is a set of harmonic waves derived from the underlying Laplacian matrix of the brain network (Atasoy et al., 2016, 2017). Some studies have extended the discovery to Alzheimer’s disease, Chen et al. (2020b,a) first proposed a manifold learning approach to identify the global common harmonic waves from a set of brain networks, which can be used to characterize the network alterations in the graph spectrum domain. This method offers a new window into the investigation of frequency-based alterations in AD progression. Moreover, Chen et al. (2021) extended global common harmonic waves to localized harmonic wavelets by developing a harmonic localization method. This method generates a set of local single-scale harmonic wavelets (shown in Fig. 1(c)) where the oscillation patterns in each harmonic wavelet characterize the spreading pathway that can be used to investigate the local propagation patterns of neuropathology within a single hierarchical module. These methods demonstrate the ability of the harmonic analysis approach as a new brain network analysis technique to discover the propagation pathway of neuropathological burdens, which is more attractive in AD studies. However, the current harmonic wavelet identification approaches lack adequate consideration of the intrinsic properties of brain-network organization, limiting their performance in characterizing the accurate and interpretable propagation patterns of neuropathological events in the brain.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel harmonic wavelet analysis approach, which seamlessly incorporates topological characteristics in complex brain networks to discover a set of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets in the spatial domain of brain. Such learned harmonic wavelets allow us to characterize the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens from multiple hierarchical modules across the brain network. Specifically, we first select the nodes with high centrality as the underlying hub nodes via a broad array of network centrality measures, including node degree, betweenness, pagerank, and participation coefficient, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Then, we design a hierarchically modular binary mask representation method to effectively describe the hierarchically modular property of the brain network (Fig. 2(b)). Next, a set of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets (Fig. 2(c)) in the spatial domain of a hierarchical module (Fig. 2(b)) can be obtained via our proposed method. Since the spreading of the neuropathological burdens follows the topology of the brain network (Fig. 2(d)), a new imaging biomarker depicting the resonance between the spatial pattern of pathological burdens and the oscillation pattern in the harmonic wavelet can be used to identify the AD-related spreading pathways of neuropathological events throughout the brain (Fig. 2(e)).

We have evaluated the statistical power of our method on synthetic data and neuroimaging data from the ADNI database. Compared with other state-of-the-art harmonic analysis approaches, our proposed method achieves higher performance for classifying CN (cognitively normal), EMCI (early-stage mild cognitive impairment), and LMCI (late-state mild cognitive impairment) comparison. Furthermore, we have not only identified a set of brain regions that can be used as potential hub nodes leading to cognitive decline in AD progression, but also discovered the AD-related propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens spreading across brain networks.

2. Method

In this section, we first introduce the brief background on MST brain network and harmonic waves on brain network in Section 2.1. We then construct a harmonic wavelet analysis framework to identify a set of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets across the brain network in Section 2.2, followed by the optimization scheme in Section 2.3. The application of the learned multi-scale harmonic wavelets is demonstrated in Section 2.4. The notation used in this paper is summarized in Table 1 for ease of exposition.

2.1. Background: MST brain network and harmonic waves on brain network

2.1.1. MST brain network

In graph theory, each brain network constructed through MRI and DTI neuroimages can be represented as a graph G=(V,E,W), with node set V=vi∣i∈1,…,N from N brain regions and edge set E=eij∣vi,vj∈V×V representing all possible links between nodes. The symmetric adjacency matrix W=wijN×N∈RN×N with non-negative weights wij reflects the strength of node–node connection.

Reconstructing the MST brain network W˜ based on the adjacency matrix W is a valid way to describe the brain network topology unbiased (van Dellen et al., 2018). In our method, the MST brain network is constructed by Kruskal’s algorithm (Kruskal, 1956), which is realized by following steps: (1) Rank all edges in descending order; (2) Select edge with maximum weight unless the edge makes those nodes into a loop; (3) Repeat step 2 until all nodes are in the tree.

2.1.2. Harmonic waves on brain network

As stated in Atasoy et al. (2016), we derive a set of harmonic waves Ψ∈RN×P from the eigen-system of the underlying Laplacian matrix L=D−W, where the diagonal matrix D(i,i)=∑j=1Nwij can be regarded as the degree matrix of the graph. Each diagonal element indicates the total connectivity degree of the underlying node. Specifically, the harmonic waves Ψ are estimated by solving the following eigenvalue problem: (1) minΨ∈ℝN×PTr(ΨTLΨ)s.t.ΨTΨ=IP

where Tr(⋅) is the trace operator and IP denotes the P×P identity matrix. The deterministic solution Ψ=ψpp=1P consists of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix L associated with the first P smallest eigenvalues λp∣p=1,…,P,λ1≤λ2≤⋯≤λP, indicating the harmonic wave exhibits faster oscillation patterns across the brain network as the eigenvalue increases. Since the harmonic waves associated with the high frequency (larger eigenvalues) are often sensitive to possible noise, we only consider the first P(P&lt;N) harmonic waves.

2.2. Framework: Region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelet construction on stiefel manifold

2.2.1. Extraction of brain regions with high centrality

Suppose we have a set of MST brain networks W˜t∣t=1,…,T, we can calculate the group-mean adjacency matrix W‾ by averaging all MST brain networks W˜t, i.e., W−=1T∑t=1TW˜t. In network neuroscience, the brain network is usually composed of many peripheral regions and some central regions, i.e., hubs, which manifest the key roles in transmitting and communicating hierarchical information (Li et al., 2022). As introduced in van den Heuvel and Sporns (2013), several network nodal measurements can be used to extract the brain regions with high centrality. For instance, the degree centrality is measured as the number of edges on nodes, and it is an appropriate measurement for identifying hub nodes. The pagerank centrality tends to detect nodes connected to other highly central nodes, and the betweenness centrality is defined as the number of shortest communication paths in the network that pass through a given node. The participation coefficient measures the distribution of the node’s edges, which achieves by maximizing the number of within-group edges and minimizing the number of between-group edges, so it is closely connected with provincial hubs and connector hubs. To this end, we select nodes with high centrality as underlying hub nodes by calculating a composite score of node degree, betweenness, pagerank, and participation coefficient on W−. Specifically, we first calculate the scores of degree, betweenness, pagerank, and participation coefficient at each node separately, where the computational details of these four centrality measurements are shown in Suppl. Tab. S1. Then, we normalize those scores of all nodes to the range of 0 to 1. Next, we sort all nodes according to the final composite score obtained by combining these four normalized centrality measurements in descending order. Lastly, we select top m nodes vi∣i=1,…,m as the underlying hub nodes by a given threshold. In our experiments on the ADNI database, the 40 nodes with the highest composite score (blue nodes) are designated as underlying hub nodes, as shown in Fig. 3.

2.2.2. Construction of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets

Given the group-mean adjacency matrix W−, the common harmonic waves Ψ can be calculated by Eq. (1). Since the N×P orthogonal matrix Ψ located on the Stiefel manifold (Chikuse, 2003), it is suitable to be used as a common brain network harmonic bases (Atasoy et al., 2016, 2017) to characterize the frequency-based energy representations of each instance of neuropathological burdens f=fjj=1N propagating throughout the brain network. However, the common harmonic waves have the limitation of global nature, like the Fourier bases in signal processing. In practical neuroscience applications, the spreading pathway of neuropathological events exhibits more localized propagation patterns that occur in hierarchical modules at particular brain regions (Vogel et al., 2020). To address this drawback, we provide region-specific pyramidal multi-scale complementary to the global harmonics by integrating the region-specific and hierarchically modular constraints to Eq. (1).

In this section, we present the following three components to learn the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φi,k=[φi,k,q]q=1Q∈RN×Q on kth hierarchical module at the underlying hub node vi, where the Q stands for the number of wavelet frequencies.

First, the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φi,k is required to preserve the localized topological structure of brain network. Thus, this can be obtained by minimizing a harmonic energy term EsmoothΦi,k=Tr(Φi,kTL−Φi,k). In addition, we constrain Φi,k to be an orthogonal base resided on the Stiefel manifold, i.e. Φi,kTΦi,k=IQ.

Second, to reflect the hierarchically modular property of the brain network, we define a set of hierarchical modules on each underlying hub node vi in the network G,Gi,h=Gi,k=Vi,k,Ei,kk=1,2,…,h, where Vi,k=v∈V∣sv,vi≤k,Ei,k=v',v∈E∣v',v∈Vi,k, and s⋅,vi is the length of the shortest-path between node vi and the other node based on group-mean adjacency matrix W−. Here, parameter h stands for the number of hierarchical modules in the set Gi,h. In our real experiments, we set h=3 according to the density of the brain network. Furthermore, to integrate the hierarchical modularity of brain network into each harmonic wavelets Φi,k, we require that the support of Φi,k does not expand more than kth hierarchical module centered at the underlying hub node vi, i.e., Gi,k. To achieve this goal, we introduce a hierarchically modular binary mask ui,k=ui,k(j)j=1N as an auxiliary vector: ui,k(j)=1vj∈Vi,kinthehierarchicalmoduleGi,k,0otherwise.

Finally, a region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelet presentation term can be defined by ElocalΦi,k=TrΦi,kTdiag1−ui,kΦi,k, where diag(⋅) denotes the vector diagonalization. Minimizing ElocalΦi,k tends to optimize Φi,k2 to be zero out of the hierarchical module Gi,k. Since diag1−ui,k is zero for the nodes in Gi,k and has no effect in minimizing the energy term Elocal, it can be used to suppress the waves (oscillations) out of Gi,k while preserving the waves in Gi,k.

Third, to reduce the redundancy between global common harmonic waves Ψ and each harmonic wavelets Φi,k at node vi, we require common harmonics Ψ to be independent of each harmonic wavelets Φi,k via constraint Φi,kTΨ=0. To facilitate the computational complexity, we relax the constraint alternatively by promoting the orthogonality to the subspace spanned by Ψ, through minimizing Eorth(Φi,k)=Tr(Φi,kTΨΨTΦi,k). Similarly, we require that harmonic wavelets with different scales are orthogonal to each other, i.e. Φi,kTΦi,l=0Q,∀k,l∈{1,2,3},k≠l.

Finally, the whole energy function of identifying region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φi,k in kth hierarchical module centered at the underlying hub node vi is formulated as: (2) min{Φi,k}∑k=13{Tr(Φi,kTL¯Φi,k)+μ1Tr(Φi,kTdiag(1−ui,k)Φi,k)+μ2Tr(Φi,kTΨΨTΦi,k)}s.t.Φi,kTΦi,k=I,Φi,kTΦi,l=0,∀k,l∈{1,2,3},k≠l

where μ1 and μ2 are two scalars balancing the strength of hierarchical modularity and redundancy with the global common harmonic waves Ψ.

2.3. Optimization: Identify region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets via manifold optimization

In this section, for each underlying hub node vi, we first introduce a variable Ωi, which is achieved by simply integrating Φi,1,Φi,2,Φi,3 into a new matrix Ωi=Φi,1,Φi,2,Φi,3∈RN×3Q. Thus, the objective function in Eq. (2) can be rewritten as the following energy function form by simple mathematical transformations: (3) minΩiTr(ΩiT(L¯+μ2ΨΨT)Ωi)+μ1∑k=13{Tr(ΔkΩiTdiag(1−ui,k)Ωi)}s.t.ΩiTΩi=I3Q

where Δ1=(IQ0000Q0000Q),Δ2=(0Q000IQ0000Q),Δ3=(0Q0000Q000IQ)

Since Eq. (3) is a typical quadratic problem on the Stiefel manifold, it often required that Ai=L−+μ2ΨΨT+μ1∑k=13diag1−ui,k is positive definite. In order to achieve this, we introduce a relaxation parameter α, which makes sure A~i=αI−Ai is a positive definite matrix. α is set as the greatest eigenvalue of matrix Ai. To simplify the formula, we use Bi,k to replace diag1−ui,k. By doing so, the minimization of Eq. (3) turns into maximizing: (4) maxΩiTr(ΩiT((A˜i+μ1∑k=13Bi,k)Ωi−μ1∑k=13Bi,kΩiΔk))s.t.ΩiTΩi=I3Q

Furthermore, it can be rewritten as: (5) maxΩiTr(ΩiTMi)s.t.ΩiTΩi=I3Q

where (6) Mi=(A˜i+μ1∑k=13Bi,k)Ωi−μ1∑k=13Bi,kΩiΔk

It is apparent that the objective function in Eq. (5) can be simply solved by power iteration (Nie et al., 2017) in the following four steps:

Randomly initialize Ωi∈RN×3Q such that ΩiTΩi=I3Q×3Q and α is the greatest eigenvalue after applying SVD to matrix Ai.

Update Mi by calculating (A~i+μ1∑k=13Bi,k)Ωi−μ1∑k=13Bi,kΩiΔk.

Calculate Ωi by maximizing TrΩiTMi and subject it to orthogonal constraint ΩiTΩi=I3Q. We can derive the closed-form solution by Ωi=UVT, where U and V are the left and right Eigen matrix after the SVD on Mi.

Iteratively perform the step (2)~(3) until the algorithm converges.

Consequently, the entire optimization scheme of identifying region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets is summarized in Algorithm 1.

Hyperparameter Tuning.

In the proposed objective function in Eq. (2), we need to tune two types of parameters: harmonic number (P and Q) and hyperparameters μ1 and μ2. Since the higher frequency harmonic waves tend to be sensitive to potential noise, we determine to use only the smallest P eigenvectors ΦsP instead of the whole eigenvectors Φs. According to the reconstruction loss calculated by matrix norm between original Laplacian matrix Ls and the reconstructed Laplacian matrix LˆsP=ΦsPTΛPΦsP with ΛP as the diagonal matrix of the first P eigen-value of the Laplacian matrix Ls, the dimension P is determined, which is located at the stable point such that the reduction in reconstruction loss is marginal as P increases. Additionally, the number Q of harmonic wavelets Φi,k is determined according to the average node degree of all underlying hub nodes. For the hyperparameter selection, we apply a grid search scheme to select the optimal parameters μ1 and μ2 based on the classification accuracy. In the following experiments on ADNI neuroimaging data, we set the harmonic number P=55 and Q=6, respectively. Regarding hyperparameters, we set μ1=0.8 and μ2=0.7 as the optimal parameters, achieving the best classification performance.

Computational Complexity and Convergence Analysis.

The complexity of Algorithm 1 is mainly dependent on SVD decomposition and matrix multiplication. In SVD decomposition, U and V are (N×3Q) and (3Q×3Q) matrices, so constructing these matrices has a time complexity of ONQ2. While matrix multiplication has the same time complexity as SVD decomposition. In the whole algorithm, the maximal iteration number is H, and the number of samples is m; therefore, optimizing Algorithm 1 has the time complexity of OmHNQ2. As shown in Algorithm 1, we adopt the generalized power iteration (GPI) to solve Eq. (5) on the Stiefel manifold. The convergence of the GPI algorithm has been theoretically proved by the theorem 1–2 in Nie et al. (2017).

2.4. Application: A new neuroimaging biomarker in AD

The empirical biomarkers such as amyloid deposition and tau tangle aggregation are the hallmarks of AD progression, which may be sufficient to cause downstream pathologic changes leading to cognitive decline (Jack Jr. et al., 2018). Traditional neuroimaging studies usually adopt empirical biomarkers to investigate the neuropathological mechanism of AD. In this work, we develop a novel harmonic wavelet analysis approach to discover the brain network changes that are associated with local propagation patterns of pathological burdens in multiple hierarchical modules at particular underlying hub nodes across the brain network. The learned region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φi,k are used to generate the new hierarchical-adaptive-wavelet representations (HAW in short) for each individual subject of observed empirical biomarkers f∈RN by: (7) hˆi,k,p=|f,φi,k,p|2

where each element in vector f denotes the biomarker score of each node in the brain network. The intuition behind hˆi,k,p essentially characterizes the harmonic energy of spreading the neuropathological burden f through pth harmonic wavelet φi,k,p in kth hierarchical module at underlying hub node vi. In Section 3.2, we will show the enhanced performance of our proposed new neuroimaging biomarkers in classifying CN, EMCI, and LMCI, compared with current state-of-the-art harmonic analysis approaches.

3. Experiments

To evaluate the statistical power of our HAW biomarker, we compare the performance of our proposed harmonic analysis approach to two state-of-the-art harmonic network analysis approaches on both simulated and real neuroimaging data. These two harmonic network analysis approaches include the global common harmonic wave identification method (Chen et al., 2020b) and single-scale harmonic wavelet identification technique (Chen et al., 2021). Thus, we define our proposed region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets as Φm, global common harmonic waves as Φg, and single-scale harmonic wavelets as Φs. In addition, the empirical biomarkers f is also used as a baseline to compare with our proposed method.

3.1. Evaluation of HAW on simulated data

3.1.1. Data synthesis

In this section, we generate two different groups of simulated biomarker vectors fj1∣j=1,…,n∈RN and fj2∣j=1,…,n∈RN based on a given group-mean adjacency matrix W‾∈RN×N. Specifically, these two groups of simulated biomarker vectors are generated by the following steps: (1) generating two sets of key nodes and their corresponding propagation patterns based on the nodal degree and the nearest neighbor edges on W‾, such as the node 2 with its corresponding hierarchically modular spreading pathways for group 1 (first two rows in Fig. 4(a)), and the node 11 with its corresponding hierarchically modular propagation patterns for group 2 (last two rows in Fig. 4(a)); (2) linearly combining the propagation patterns generated in step 1 with random weights to form two groups of simulated biomarker vectors; (3) adding the Gaussian noise contamination with standard deviation σ into the generated simulated dataset.

3.1.2. Representation capability of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets

Here, we use a toy example to illustrate the representation ability of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets identified by our proposed method. First, we generate two groups of simulated biomarker vectors with dimension N=10, where the ground truth of key nodes and their corresponding propagation patterns are shown in Fig. 4(a). Secondly, we separately apply l1-SVM to classify these two groups based on the harmonic-based features generated by our proposed region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φm, single-scale harmonic wavelets Φs, and global common harmonic waves Φg. The top 4 harmonics with the highest weight coefficient in Φm, Φs, and Φg are respectively selected as the candidate propagation patterns, as shown in Fig. 4(b–d). It is clear that (1) the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets identified by our proposed method are closest to the ground truth of propagation patterns, compared to the other two harmonic analysis methods. (2) The single-scale harmonic wavelet identification method can capture the first modular propagation patterns (shown in the first two rows of Fig. 4(c)), but exhibits poor performance in identifying second modular propagation patterns (shown in the last two rows of Fig. 4(c)). (3) Due to the global nature of the global common harmonic waves, such harmonics are hard to characterize the localized propagation patterns, as shown in Fig. 4(d).

3.1.3. Accuracy of classification, underlying hub detection and propagation pattern identification

In this section, we are interested in evaluating the performance of our proposed method in classifying different groups, detecting underlying hub nodes, and identifying hierarchically modular propagation patterns. We generate two groups of the simulated datasets based on a given graph with N=148 nodes, where each group consists of 15 key hub nodes and each hub node corresponds to three hierarchically modular propagation patterns. The accuracy of classification based on multi-scale wavelets Φm, single-scale wavelets Φs, global harmonics Φg, and original biomarkers f under various Gaussian noise contaminations σ is shown in Fig. 5(a). Since global common harmonic waves have the limitation of global-ness, we apply our proposed method and single-scale harmonic wavelet identification method to calculate the accuracy of detecting underlying hubs and multi-scale propagation patterns, as shown in Fig. 5(b,c). It is apparent that (1) the harmonic network analysis methods Φm,Φs, and Φg achieve higher stratification accuracy than original biomarkers f. Among them, our proposed method outperforms the single-scale wavelets and global harmonics. (2) Since the harmonic wavelets Φm and Φs have the power to characterize the localized propagation patterns, they are capable of locating the underlying hub nodes and thus achieve high hub node identification accuracy, while our proposed method is slightly better than the single-scale wavelet identification method. (3) Due to the hierarchically modular property of our proposed wavelets Φm, it exhibits an enhanced ability to identify the propagation patterns, compared to the single-scale harmonic wavelets Φs.

3.2. Evaluation of HAW on ADNI data

Training Data.

In this section, we collect neuroimaging data of 138 subjects (shown in Table 2), including T1-weighted MR and DWI images from the ADNI database, to construct the structural brain networks for identifying region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φi,k∣i=1,…,m;k=1,2,3. Each structural brain network can be constructed by the following major image processing steps. First, we parcellate the cortical surface into 148 cortical regions based on a T1-weighted MR image in the light of a Destrieux atlas (Destrieux et al., 2010). Then, we apply surface seed-based probabilistic fiber tractography (Destrieux et al., 2010) to the DWI image to generate a 148 × 148 anatomical connectivity matrix Wt∣t=1,…,138. Testing Data. After learning the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets Φi,k, we collect another two datasets, including amyloid-PET scanned by AV45 and tau-PET neuroimaging datasets from ADNI for the downstream analyses. The demographic information of testing data is shown in Table 3. Similarly, we adopt the above-mentioned image processing pipeline to parcellate the cortical surface and calculate the standard update value ratio (SUVR) of each brain region for each PET image as an instance of empirical biomarkers fs∣s=1,…,S. The detailed information of neuroimaging data preprocessing can be found in the Supplementary material.

3.2.1. Evaluating the statistical power of HAW biomarker on amyloid-PET data

In what follows, we estimate the statistical power of our HAW biomarker in stratifying the aging subjects in the pre-clinical stage of AD, identifying the underlying AD-related brain regions, discovering the frequency-based harmonic wavelet alterations, and investigating the association between clinical information and significant harmonic wavelets on amyloid-PET neuroimaging data.

First, we build three group comparisons (CN/LMCI, CN/EMCI, and EMCI/LMCI) of amyloid biomarkers. For each comparison, we use the amyloid HAW biomarkers based on our harmonic wavelets Φm to train the classifier using l1-SVM optimized by the public toolbox LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008). The l1-SVM applies the least square loss function to conduct the reconstruction error and embeds feature selection by the l1-norm regularization term on the coefficient matrix. To compare the classification power across harmonic network analysis methods, we separately train l1 - SVM on harmonic-based features based on global common harmonic waves Φg and single-scale harmonic wavelets Φs. To demonstrate the advantage of harmonic-based features over the empirical amyloid biomarkers, we also train l1-SVM classifier using the amyloid SUVR score f. Finally, the classification performance, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F-score, is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The final results are shown in Table 4. It is easy to draw that (1) our amyloid HAW biomarker achieves the highest accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F-score over all other methods in three group comparisons, where the red star ‘*’ indicates that our results are significantly better than those of the compared methods with p&lt;0.01; (2) the classification performance using harmonic wavelets Φm and Φs is superior to those of global harmonic waves Φg, indicating the localized oscillation patterns in the harmonic wavelets are more appropriate for characterizing the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens than global harmonic waves; (3) all harmonic-based features outperform empirical biomarkers f, which indicate the great potential of applying harmonic network analysis approaches in the early diagnosis of AD.

Second, benefiting from the feature selection of l1-SVM classifier, we show the Manhattan plot of the feature weight matrix obtained using the trained l1-SVM by taking CN/LMCI group comparison as an example in the first row of Fig. 6, where the panels from left to right represent the weight coefficients of the first, second, and third-scale harmonic wavelets respectively. We use different colors to denote the frequency of the harmonic wavelet. Moreover, we extract the top five key nodes depending on the highest weight coefficient across the spectrum of the amyloid HAW biomarkers from three different scales, respectively. Next, we calculate the betweenness and local efficiency for each node, as shown in the second row of Fig. 6, where the nodes at the first, second, and third scale are tagged in red, green, and blue respectively. The results of the other three centrality measurements (degree, pagerank, and participation coefficient) are shown in Suppl. Fig. S1. It is clear that the betweenness of those key nodes on a large scale is significantly higher than those on a small scale, while the local efficiency is contrary. These results indicate our proposed multi-scale harmonic wavelet analysis approach has the potential not only to discover the significant brain regions with high degree and local efficiency (putative provincial hubs), but also to identify the significant brain regions with high betweenness score (putative connector hubs). Some of these identified nodes have been demonstrated to be closely related to the development and progression of AD, such as posterior cingulate (Buckner et al., 2009) and inferior frontal (Lin et al., 2017).

Third, we explore the frequency-based harmonic wavelet alterations on the amyloid deposition by using the learned region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets. Recall we have identified in total fifteen significant brain regions from three different scales in CN/LMCI comparison using amyloid HAW biomarkers. Here, we focus on the significant harmonic wavelets associated with these fifteen brain regions (shown in Fig. 7(a)). We first calculate the total energy of significant harmonic wavelets associated with the fifteen identified brain regions for each subject and plot its distribution for CN (in red) and LMCI (in green) groups in Fig. 7(b). These results suggest that the empirical amyloid along the propagation pathway across the brain network raises the harmonic energy of particular harmonic wavelets, which ultimately leads to cognitive decline. Moreover, we visualize the top three significant harmonic wavelets with the highest weight coefficients in different scales in Fig. 7(c), where the red node denotes the central hub node, and the red/blue arrows indicate the positive/negative oscillations in each harmonic wavelet. These harmonic wavelets have great potential in characterizing the spreading pathways of neuropathological burdens related to the development of AD.

Fourth, we are interested in further research on whether there is a significant association between clinical information and the HAW biomarkers of identified significant harmonic wavelets. Here, the general linear model (GLM) is applied to predict the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score using our HAW biomarkers, where age and gender are added as the confounders to reduce their influence in our statistical model. We apply the top three significant harmonic wavelets in different scales (shown in Fig. 7(c)) for GLM analyses and plot the statistical results in Fig. 8. It is apparent that (1) 100%(9/9) HAW biomarkers manifest a significant association (p&lt;0.01) with the MMSE score on amyloid-PET data. (2) The significant amyloid HAW biomarkers are negatively associated with the MMSE scores, which is in line with the findings above.

3.2.2. Evaluating the statistical power of HAW biomarker on tau-PET data

Similarly, we also separately train the l1-SVM classifier on our tau HAW biomarkers, harmonic-based features based on global common harmonic waves Φg and single-scale harmonic wavelets Φs, as well as tau SUVR score f to evaluate the classification performance using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification results of CN/EMCI, EMCI/LMCI, and CN/LMCI group comparison, using our HAW biomarker and the other three biomarkers are shown in Table 5, where our tau HAW biomarker significantly outperforms the other three biomarkers on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-score scores (p&lt;0.01). Then, we show the Manhattan plot of the weight coefficient matrix for all harmonic wavelets (3 scales × 40 regions × 6 harmonic frequencies) in CN/LMCI group comparison (shown in the first row of Fig. 9). The top five significant brain regions with the highest average weight coefficient (significant harmonic wavelet) for each scale are selected. We calculate the betweenness and local efficiency score for fifteen brain regions, and plot these scores in the second row of Fig. 9. These results manifest similar findings (67%(10/15) key node coincidence rate) of Fig. 6 on amyloid-PET data, indicating the efficiency of our proposed method in identifying the putative hub nodes relevant to the development of AD. Furthermore, since fifteen brain regions (shown in Fig. 10(a)) have been identified as showing significant CN/LMCI group differences, we calculate the total energy of significant harmonic wavelets associated with these fifteen identified brain regions for each subject and plot their distribution for CN (in red) and LMCI (in green) groups in Fig. 10(b). The histogram of whole-brain harmonic energy illustrates a similar trend as the amyloid HAW biomarkers that the higher aggregation of tau tangles in the late-stage aging cohort produces a higher harmonic energy load in the brain network system. The top three significant harmonic wavelets for each scale mapped on the cortical surface are also shown in Fig. 10(c) respectively. We also apply the GLM model to the top three significant tau HAW biomarkers for each scale to predict the MMSE score and plot their statistical results in Fig. 11, where 78%(7/9) tau HAW biomarkers show a significantly negative association with the MMSE score.

4. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a proof-of-concept harmonic wavelet analysis approach to identify the AD-related brain regions that are actively involved in the spreading pathways of neuropathological events. The backbone of our proposed method is a set of region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets that allow us to characterize the propagation patterns of neuropathological burdens from multiple hierarchical modules centered at particular brain regions. In light of this, we present a manifold-based optimization method to generate harmonic wavelets by integrating the intrinsic characteristics of the brain-network organization, such as hub nodes and hierarchical modularity. Compared with other harmonic analysis methods, our proposed method achieves enhanced statistical power in group comparison on both simulated and ADNI neuroimaging datasets. In the future, we plan to investigate the association between the region-specific pyramidal multi-scale harmonic wavelets and genetic factors in AD progression.
