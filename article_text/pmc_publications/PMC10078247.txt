Motor features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are heterogeneous and well-studied; non-tremor features of postural instability and gait dysfunction (PIGD) have been linked to worse outcomes and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) co-pathology. However, these features are understudied in Lewy body dementias (LBD). Here we perform retrospective analysis of a unique cohort of LBD (n=30) with Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) data collected at baseline in proximity to cerebrospinal fluid collection to test the hypothesis that LBD patients with a positive AD biomarker profile (LBD+AD=13) would have higher PIGD burden compared with LBD patients without AD biomarker positivity (LBD−AD=17). We find novel evidence for selective impairment of PIGD burden in LBD+AD vs LBD−AD (OR=1.95, 95%CI=1.02-3.70, p=0.04) and a direct association of increasing CSF tau/Aβ1-42 ratio with increasing PIGD disability in the total cohort (β=0.23, SE=0.08, p=0.01). This unique biomarker stratification approach suggests AD co-pathology may contribute to PIGD motor signs in LBD.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Lewy body dementia (LBD) comprises a spectrum of patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson’s disease with dementia (PDD). There is considerable clinical heterogeneity within these patient groups but there are overlapping core clinical features of DLB that can occur very early in the disease course for many people with PDD [1]. Increasing evidence from postmortem examinations and emerging biomarker research finds a strong clinical influence from mixed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) co-pathology in LBD. This includes poor prognosis for overall global measures of dementia onset and survival but also specific clinical features of cognitive impairment [2]. The underlying biological substrates for motor heterogeneity in LBD patients is less clear compared to that of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Indeed, motor symptoms in PD are heterogeneous and postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) symptoms have been particularly linked to poor outcomes, including dementia, reduced survival and AD co-pathology[3]. Here we utilize a unique dataset of autopsy/CSF-confirmed LBD patients with prospectively collected UPDRS data for motor phenotyping to test the hypothesis that AD biomarker positivity has a specific association with gait dysfunction and postural instability in LBD.

METHODS

Patients

Patients were clinically evaluated at the Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center, Penn Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Center, Philadelphia Parkinson’s Disease Research Education and Clinical Center (PADRECC) at the VA, or Penn Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center as part of ongoing clinical research programs. Clinical data including demographics, clinical assessments, and biologic results are anonymized and stored in the Penn Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Database (INDD). Inclusion criteria included an antemortem clinical diagnosis meeting clinical criteria for DLB[4] or PDD[5] with a short motor-dementia interval of 5 years or less to focus on the clinicopathologic overlap of early dementia in PDD/DLB[1]. Patients met formal LBD criteria and thus did not have other co-morbidities such as vascular dementia or normal pressure hydrocephalus. We included patients with available AD CSF biomarker data and prospectively collected baseline UPDRS Part III data. Two autopsy-confirmed LBD patients had secondary pathologic diagnoses of cerebrovascular disease and tauopathy from chronic traumatic encephalopathy and were excluded. Our final cohort included 30 patients reported in Table 1.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents

All data was collected with informed consent from patients under institutional review board approval.

CSF collection and analysis

CSF samples were collected per standard research protocols and analyzed using a Luminex xMAP immunoassay platform (Luminex, Austin, TX) to measure CSF total tau (t-tau), p-tau (phosphorylated at threonine-181), and Abeta1-42 as described [6]. CSF data at baseline or within 5 years of dementia diagnosis were utilized in our analysis. We used our previously established autopsy-confirmed cutpoint of t-tau/ Aβ1-42 ratio of &lt;0.3 to categorize LBD cohort into those with (LBD+AD) and without AD biomarker positivity (LBD−AD) for analysis [7].

UPDRS Evaluation

Baseline UPDRS Part III motor exams and Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H&amp;Y) Scale scores collected by individual specialists at one of the aforementioned centers were utilized in our analysis to capture the motor phenotype of biomarker groups of LBD patients. This legacy data using the UPDRS-III scoring system was also converted to a total motor score corresponding to the MDS revised UPDRS version using a previously validated algorithm[8].

Statistical Analysis

Demographics data was compared between groups using univariate statistics including independent student t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test and chi-square analysis as appropriate. CSF biomarker measurements were not normally distributed and therefore were natural-log transformed for analysis.

The focus of our study was comparison of non-tremor features of postural instability and gait function between biomarker-defined groups of LBD. Thus, we constructed a composite of part III scores including the gait (item 29) and postural instability (item 30) scores to capture postural instability and gait dysfunction domain of motor functioning. To test specificity of our findings we also tested the relationship of the converted total MDS-UPDRS Part III motor score, H&amp;Y score, rigidity subscore (sum of items 22a-e), Body bradykinesia subscore (item 31), and tremor subscore (sum of items 20a-e and 21a-b) with LBD biomarker groups and values. Missing data for total UPDRS III for 4 patients was excluded from analyses and reported in Table 1.

First, we used multivariate logistic regression to test the association of motor scores with the LBD biomarker group as the dependent variable (LBD+AD vs LBD−AD), while controlling for age at time of UPDRS evaluation and time interval from reported disease onset to motor evaluation in years. Next, we examined the relationship of motor scores as an independent variable with a continuous measure of AD biomarkers (CSF t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio) as the dependent variable in multivariate linear regression while controlling for these same covariates. To account for total motor severity we performed alternative models with total MDS-UPDRS III motor score as a covariate, along with the age at testing. Finally, subanalyses were performed to examine the subgroup of patients who met clinical criteria for DLB (n=26) (i.e. excluding PDD) and those patients untreated with L-DOPA at the time of assessment (n=19) with the same covariates as the base models above. Please see supplementary Figure 1 for flowchart of statistical models.

All analyses were performed using STATA 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and since our approach was hypothesis driven a significance level of p&lt;0.05 was used.

RESULTS

30 patients were included for study with the majority having clinical DLB (n=26) compared to PDD with a short motor-dementia interval (n=4) (Table 1). There were similar frequencies of each clinical syndrome across the biomarker-defined groups of LBD−AD (n=17) and LBD+AD (n=13). A subset of 6 DLB patients had autopsy data confirming LBD and biomarker-defined groupings. Consistent with previous autopsy literature[9], the cohort was predominantly male with a trend for higher relative number of females in the LBD+AD group (p=0.07). LBD+AD group was older at disease onset (p=0.04) but both groups had similar rigidity and global bradykinesia subscores and a level of moderate overall motor impairment per total MDS-UPDRS III and Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale (Table 1).

Using multivariate logistic regression controlling for age at time of clinical evaluation and time interval from disease onset to evaluation, the composite score of gait dysfunction and postural instability (gait +postural instability score) was associated with the categorical designation of AD co-pathology in CSF (OR=1.95, CI 1.02-3.70, p=0.04). In contrast, there was no significant difference in total tremor score, Hoehn &amp; Yahr score or total MDS-UPDRS Part III score between LBD−AD and LBD+AD using similar models (p&gt;0.05).

To test the direct relationship between CSF analytes and gait +postural instability motor scores as continuous variables, we used a multivariate linear regression model accounting for these same covariates. Consistent with our previous analysis, we found a positive association between composite gait +postural instability score and increasing CSF t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio values (β=0.23, p=0.01). There was no association with our other motor scores, including tremor, total MDS-UPDRS Part III, and H&amp;Y using similar models (p&gt;0.1). We performed exploratory linear regression analyses to test the association of each individual AD biomarker (i.e.t-tau, p-tau, and Aβ1-42) with gait+ postural instability subscore and found an association with t-tau (β=0.16, p=0.05) but not the other markers (Supplemental Tables 3–5).

Alternative models adjusting for total MDS-UPDRS III motor score showed an independent association of gait +postural instability subscore and CSF t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). Finally, our sub-analyses to examine if our findings were consistent in clinically homogenous subgroups of patients meeting clinical criteria for DLB (n=26) and the subset of all patients naïve to dopaminergic therapy at the time of testing (n=19) found similar results (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2).

DISCUSSION

In this study, we investigated the relationship between prospectively collected ratings of gait and postural instability and CSF AD biomarkers in LBD patients. We found a composite gait and postural instability score in LBD to be associated with a CSF biomarker profile indicative of underlying AD co-pathology. The severity of this motor deficit also correlated with continuous measures of AD CSF biomarkers in the total LBD cohort. This association appeared specific to gait and postural instability, as there was no significant association of the CSF biomarker profile with tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity or total motor impairment (MDS-UPDRS Part III total and Hoehn &amp; Yahr). However, there was trend level findings suggestive of possible greater total motor impairment and bradykinesia in the LBD+AD group (Table 1) which could become significant in a future study using a larger sample. Nonetheless, when adjusting for total motor burden in our multivariate models we still found a significant independent association of AD CSF biomarkers and gait +postural instability score (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Our investigation is unique in its focus on patients in the spectrum of synucleinopathies with early dementia (i.e. LBD) where standardized approaches to motor phenotype are seldom studied or related to biomarker data.

Most previous work studying motor features in LBD has focused on group-level comparisons of clinically-defined cohorts of PDD and DLB. These data suggest the majority of PDD and DLB patients have prominent postural instability and balance difficulties compared to PD, but there is significant heterogeneity[10]. Indeed, other motor features more common in PD, such as rest tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity have been found more commonly in DLB compared to autopsy-confirmed AD with or without alpha-synuclein Lewy body pathology [11]. Moreover, subgroups of PD with more prominent PIGD symptoms have been linked to postmortem AD neuropathology at autopsy[3] and AD CSF biomarkers[12]. The precise neuroanatomic substrate linking AD co-pathology to postural instability and gait dysfunction in synucleinopathies is not entirely clear. There is likely a complex interaction of pathological and neurochemical features in the variable expression of motor symptoms across the clinicopathological spectrum of PD, PDD, DLB and AD. Moreover, the LBD+AD group had worse cognitive impairment and we cannot rule out a cognitive contribution to gait and postural instability subscores. Here, we provide novel evidence to suggest that AD co-pathology may contribute to heterogeneity of motor phenotype of synucleinopathies with early dementia.

There are certain limitations to our analysis. First, while data was collected prospectively our analysis was retrospective and cross-sectional in nature. Second, the sample was relatively small, and autopsy-confirmation of LBD was only in a subset of patients, accordant with the rarity of motor data being available alongside autopsy and/or CSF biomarkers in LBD. This limited our ability to perform larger multivariate models and test multiple demographic features simultaneously; however, we accounted for age, disease duration and total motor severity in our models and our careful subanalyses accounted for clinical phenotype and L-DOPA treatment yielding similar results (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). We focused on t-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio as this biomarker most robustly differentiated LBD+AD vs LBD−AD in our autopsy cohort[7] but exploratory analysis of individual biomarkers suggests the strongest association of gait+ postural instability subscore may be with CSF t-tau (Supplemental Tables 3–5). Future work in larger datasets can comprehensively test associations with these individual biomarkers and classifications using amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (i.e. A/T/N) criteria [13]. While we carefully assessed for other age-related contributors to gait and postural instability in our cohort, future work in larger biomarker/autopsy-confirmed LBD should examine imaging metrics of subcortical vascular and other potential co-pathologies. Finally, our group was relatively modest in their level of gait +postural instability score and total motor impairment (Table 1). This result could be attributed to the cross-sectional nature of the analysis at baseline evaluation and the relative limited scale to objectively test postural instability and gait on UPDRS. Indeed, future work using emerging wearable technology to objectively and longitudinally measure motor phenotype in greater granularity may reveal greater insights into the motor heterogeneity of LBD.

Despite these limitations, we believe our work supports the growing body of evidence of poor prognostic associations of a positive AD biomarker profile and underlying AD neuropathology in synucleinopathies to include selective influence on motor phenotype of gait dysfunction and postural instability in Lewy body dementias. Future work will elucidate the neuroanatomic and pathologic substrates for motor features in LBD.
