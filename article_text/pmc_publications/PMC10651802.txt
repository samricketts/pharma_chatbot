Introduction:

Growing evidence supports that dysfunctional autophagy, the major cell mechanism responsible for removing protein aggregates and a route of clearance for Tau in healthy neurons, is a major finding in demented Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients. However, the association of autophagy with maintenance of cognitive integrity in resilient individuals that have AD neuropathology but remain non-demented (NDAN) has not been evaluated.

Methods:

Using postmortem brain samples from age-matched healthy control, AD, and NDAN subjects, we evaluated autophagy in relation to Tau pathology using Western blot, immunofluorescence and RNA-seq.

Results:

Compared to AD patients, NDAN subjects had preserved autophagy and reduced tauopathy. Furthermore, expression of autophagy genes and AD-related proteins were significantly associated in NDAN compared to AD and control subjects.

Discussion:

Our results suggest preserved autophagy is a protective mechanism that maintains cognitive integrity in NDAN individuals. This novel observation supports the potential of autophagy-inducing strategies in AD therapeutics.

pmc1. BACKGROUND

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia, currently affecting 5.8 million people in the U.S. alone (1). AD is characterized by accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates including amyloid plaques composed of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides (2), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by highly phosphorylated Tau (3). In addition to abnormal protein aggregates, synaptic loss, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and disrupted calcium homeostasis have been observed in AD patients as well as rodent models of AD pathology (4). Clinically, in AD the extent of Tau NFTs formation correlates more closely with cognitive dysfunction than does amyloid plaque load (5–8). The mechanisms underlying pathological changes and progressive loss of synapses and cognitive dysfunction in AD are not yet clear. However, the existence of individuals who remain cognitively intact while presenting neuropathology (NFT and amyloid plaques) comparable to fully symptomatic AD patients, suggests that some neuroprotective mechanisms are triggered to evade cognitive decline and to preserve synaptic functional integrity while halting the progression of AD clinical pathology. These individuals have been recently classified as A+T+N−, where “A” refers to the value of a β-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42); “T,” the value of a Tau biomarker (CSF phospho Tau, or Tau PET); and “N,” biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET, structural MRI, or CSF total Tau) (9). In this work we will refer to these individuals as “Non-Demented with AD Neuropathology” (NDAN).

In recent years, growing evidence proposes that autophagy, the primary route of clearance for Tau in healthy neurons (10) is dysregulated in AD and animal models of AD (11–15). Initially, immature autophagosome accumulation and dystrophic neurites were observed in the brains of AD patients via electron microscopy (16), and examination of the autophagy pathway showed upregulation of the activity of the autophagy negative regulator mTor (17) and reduced expression of Beclin 1 (18), NRBF2 (19), and Atg16 L (20) in AD brains. Dysfunctional autophagy leads to the accumulation of Tau oligomers and insoluble aggregates, however their formation can be significantly alleviated through the induction of autophagy (21,22). Further evidence suggests that autophagy is required for synaptic functions including neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (23), suggesting a key role in the maintenance of cognitive ability.

Therefore, based on this evidence as well as our previous report that NDAN individuals have decreased Tau oligomers at synapses (24), we hypothesized that autophagy may be responsible for maintenance of cognitive integrity in resilient NDAN subjects through efficient removal of Tau oligomers. To test our hypothesis, we performed a comparative study of human postmortem brains of age-matched healthy control (Ctrl), AD patients and NDAN subjects, focusing on expression of proteins involved in autophagy in the context of Tau pathology. We found preserved autophagy accompanied with significantly reduced Tau pathology in NDAN subjects as compared to demented AD patients. These results indicate that autophagy is one of the neuroprotective mechanisms that can maintain cognitive integrity in NDAN.

2. METHODS

2.1 Human subjects and autopsy brain tissue

Post-mortem brain tissues were obtained from the Oregon Brain Bank at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), in Portland, OR (USA). Male and female donor subjects were enrolled and clinically evaluated in studies at the NIH-sponsored Layton Aging and AD Center (ADC) at OHSU, in accordance with protocols that were approved by the OHSU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrolment in the studies at the ADC. Subjects were participants in brain aging studies at the ADC and received annual neurological and neuropsychological evaluations, with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) assigned by an experienced clinician. Hippocampal frozen tissues were dissected to include CA1, 2, 3, 4, subiculum, and all the dentate gyrus. The stratum radiatum and overlying external plexiform layer are included as these areas were difficult to dissect out. A neuropathological assessment was performed at autopsy, and in compliance with IRB-approved protocols. A neuropathologist scored autopsy brain tissue for Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, according to standardized CERAD criteria and Braak staging (25). Participants were classified as AD when possessing a National Institute for Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke - Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorder Association diagnostic criteria for clinical AD (CDR), including a mini-mental state exam (26) (MMSE) score below 10. Ctrl participants performed normally in cognitive examinations (MMSE of 29–30). NDAN cases displayed little to no cognitive impairment (MMSE 27 or greater), though autopsy revealed presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles comparable to fully symptomatic AD (Table 1). Donor subject samples were de-identified by ADC prior to being provided to the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), so that no approval was required from the UTMB IRB under CFR §46.101(a). The cases used in this study are described in Table 1. Briefly, this study included 20 subjects: 6 Ctrl (Braak stage 2 to 3, no dementia, sex 4F-2M, age 90–100), 7 AD (Braak stage 5 to 6, demented, sex 2F-5M, age 83–95), and 7 NDAN (Braak stage 3 to 4, no dementia, sex 3F-4M, age 82–98). Please note that subject 3200 returned with a low cognitive score at the last assessment before death. However, the mild cognitive deficit was not associated with plaques or tangles, thus the subject was classified as control according to the ATN classification system (9).

To ensure that the variations in postmortem interval (PMI) did not affect the measurements, we performed a correlation analysis between PMI values and results obtained in the various assays presented here using a Pearson’s correlation test. No correlation was found between PMI values and any of the elements/antigens studied here (Figure S1), and therefore observed differences could not be attributed to differences in non-specific postmortem tissue degradation.

2.2 Western blot analysis

Hippocampal tissues (25 mg) from aged-matched controls (n=6), AD and NDAN subjects (n=7/group) were homogenized on ice in 1× RIPA buffer (catalog #9806, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) containing 1 mM PMSF, 1×Halt™ Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL). Tissue lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 15000 ×g, 4°C. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Hercules, CA).

Protein lysates (15μg) were resolved by 4%–15% SDS-PAGE (Criterion™ TGX™, Bio-Rad Laboratories), electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon®-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Synaptosomes were isolated using a standardized method developed in our laboratory and routinely used to assess synaptic dysfunction in our studies (27,28). Briefly, fresh frozen hippocampal tissues from aged-matched controls (n=6), AD and NDAN subjects (n=7/group) were homogenized in Syn-PER synaptic protein extraction reagent (catalog# 87793, ThermoFisher Scientific) containing 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Life Technologies, Inc). The total homogenate was centrifuged at 1200×g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged further at 15,000×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets containing synaptosomes were resuspended in HEPES-buffered Krebs-like (HBK) buffer (143.3 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO47H2O, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 20.1 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm NaH2PO4, and 10.3 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4), and 0.5% of F-68 non-ionic surfactant (catalog# 24040–032, ThermoFisher Scientific) was added to prevent synaptosome aggregation as previously described (29).

Primary antibodies used were as follows: Autophagy Antibody sampler kit including Beclin-1, Atg5, Atg12, Atg6L1, Atg7, Atg3, LC3AB (catalog# 4445, Cell Signaling Technology), Mitophagy Antibody sampler kit including SQSTM1/p62, NPD52, Optineurin, BNIP3L, (catalog# 43110, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-LAMP1 (1:1000, catalog# 9091, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-PMSA5 (1:1000, catalog# 2457, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p62/SQSTM1 (1:1000, catalog# ab56416, Abcam – Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, UK), anti-Tau5 (1:2000, catalog# 806401, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) anti-phospho-Tau (Ser202/Thr205) (1:1000, catalog# MN1020, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), anti-phospho-Tau (Thr231) (1:1000, catalog# MN1040, Invitrogen), anti-phospho Tau (Ser396) (1:1000, catalog# 35–5300, Invitrogen), anti-β-actin (1:50000, catalog# A1978, Sigma-Aldrich Inc., Saint Louis, MO, USA). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, catalog# 7074, Cell Signaling Technology) along with anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 catalog# 7076, Cell Signaling Technology), and the incubation time was 1h at room temperature. Signal detection was performed with Electrochemiluminescence Western Blotting Detection Reagents (RPN2209, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Relative phosphorylation and expression levels were evaluated by quantification of the relative density of each band normalized to that of the corresponding non-phosphorylated and β-actin band density, using ImageJ software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Results were graphed using Graphpad Prism 9 (San Diego CA, USA). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s comparison test was used to determine significance at p&lt;0.05.

2.3 Immunofluorescence

2.3.1 Tissue processing and immunofluorescence.

Fresh frozen hippocampal tissue blocks (Ctrl n=6; AD n=7; NDAN n=7) were removed from storage at −80°C, equilibrated at −20°C, embedded in O.C.T. compound (catalog# 4583, Tissue-Tek, Tokyo, Japan) and sectioned at 12 μm onto Superfrost/Plus slides (catalog# 12-550-15, Fisherbrand, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Prepared slides were stored at −80°C until use. For immunofluorescence studies, slides were processed as previously described (30). Briefly, slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 for 30 min at RT. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (catalog# A4503-100G, Sigma-Aldrich)/10% normal goat serum (NGS, catalog# S26-100ml Sigma-Aldrich) and sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/0.05% Tween-20 for 1h at RT. Slides were incubated with the following primary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 1.5% NGS/overnight at 4°C: rabbit anti-Beclin1 (1:200, catalog# ab62557, RRID AB_955699, Abcam); rabbit anti-ATG16L1 (1:200, catalog# ab187671, Abcam); rabbit anti-LC3B (1:200, catalog# ab192890, RRID:AB_2827794, Abcam); rabbit anti-LAMP1 (1:200, catalog# 9091s, Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-PSMA5 (1:75, catalog# 2457, RRID:AB_823611, Cell Signaling Technology.); rabbit anti-Tau (1:200, catalog# ab109392, RRID:AB_10861642, Abcam); mouse anti-PHF13.6 (1:400, catalog# 35–5300, RRID:AB_2533211, Invitrogen); rabbit anti-optineurin (1:50, catalog# ab23666, RRID:AB_447598, Abcam); and rabbit anti-NDP52 (1:100, catalog# ab 68588, Abcam). Slides were washed in PBS before incubation with the appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 1:400, Cat# A-11008, RRID:AB_143165; goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594, 1:400 Cat# A-11032, RRID:AB_2534091, ThermoFisher Scientific) in PBS containing 1.5% NGS/0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 h at RT. Finally, slides were washed in PBS, treated with 0.3% Sudan Black B prepared in 70% EtOH for 10 minutes to block lipofuscin autofluorescence, washed again with deionized water, coverslipped using Fluoromount-G containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Statistical Methodology and Applications Branch 0100–20, SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), and sealed.

2.3.2 Quantitative microscopy.

All immunoreacted sections were acquired with a Keyence BZ-X800 (Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan) microscope, by using 20x and immersion oil 100x objectives. Sections (3 per individual) were analyzed and at least 2 images per section were taken at 1,920 × 1,440 pixel resolution, with z-step size of 2 μm at 12 μm thickness. For the feasibility of the quantification, all layers from a single image stack were projected on a single slice (stack/Z projection). Quantitative analyses were performed using ImageJ software. We analyzed the intensity of fluorescence for each marker per area (Integrated Density, IntDen) when the overall distribution of a specific marker was studied, and the % of area occupied by the tangles when the hyperphosphorylation of Tau was studied. Representative images were composed in an Adobe Photoshop CC2020 format.

2.3.3 Statistical analyses.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9. Ordinary one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was used to detect significant differences between groups. Data were then expressed as means ± SD, and for all statistical analyses p&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

2.4 Gene expression analyses, immunohistochemistry, and protein quantification

2.4.1 Publicly available dataset.

Demographic information for cases from the Aging, Dementia, and Traumatic Brain Injury (ADTBI) study was downloaded from the website link (http://aging.brain-map.org/download/index). Persons who elected to participate in the brain autopsy program completed a consent packet that included: Consent for Autopsy, UW Neuropath Core Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration Brain Bank Autopsy and Tissue Donation to Brain Bank consent form, HIPAA authorization, and Autopsy Contact Information Sheet, which included consent to publish de-identified demographics and clinical information as shown in http://aging.brain-map.org/donors/summary and Table 2. The analysis in this study included 71 subjects with ages between 81 and 100+: 28 Ctrl (Braak stage 0 to 3, no dementia, sex 9F-19M), 29 AD (Braak stage 4 to 6, demented, sex 16F-13M), and 14 NDAN (Braak stage 4 to 6, no dementia, sex 10F-4M). NDAN and AD subjects were selected based on Braak stage (4 to 6), dementia status, and dementia diagnosis. To exclude any effect from age, we selected subjects from the ages of 81 to 100+; this cohort did not show differences in age between groups (one-way ANOVA F(2,70)=1.74, p=0.183). As this cohort was chosen to match donors with and without TBI, we considered selection bias when we conducted the analyses. To study associations different from TBI, the Allen Institute provides weights to reduce this selection bias. These weights were used in all analyses, as recommended in https://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/9895983/Weighted_Analyses.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1456179403835&amp;api=v2. Protein molecular changes in Tau and phospho-Tau variants, Aβ species were determined using multiplexed Luminex assays (detailed method in Quantitative Data Generation https://help.brain-map.org/display/aging/Documentation). Briefly, quantification of individual proteins was performed by using Luminex assay kits (singleplex bead kits or 11-plex custom bead kit) from Life Technologies. G extracts were used to quantify Ab40 (# LHB3481), Ab42 (# LHB3441), Tau (# LHB0041) and pT181-Tau (# LHB7051). Amyloid and Tau pathology were characterized within the tissue. Immunohistochemistry was performed in fresh frozen sections from donors’ hippocampi (detailed method in Tissue Processing https://help.brain-map.org/display/aging/Documentation). Tissue from hippocampi of donors was collected, sequenced, and normalized as described in detailed method in Quantitative Data Generation https://help.brain-map.org/display/aging/Documentation.

2.4.2 Analysis.

For the differential expression analysis, we used autophagy genes which are part of GO:0006914 (Table 3). Only 450 of 488 genes in this pathway were expressed in the hippocampi of this cohort. The data are expressed in fragments per kilobase of transcript per mapped (FPKM) reads for transcript mRNA. We performed Pearson’s correlation analysis of those 450 genes with levels of AD-related proteins available for this cohort: immunohistochemistry of Aβ (ab: 6E10), Tau (ab: Tau2) and pTau (ab: AT8); protein quantification of Aβ40, Aβ42, Tau, pTau and their ratios (most toxic over less toxic, Aβ42/Aβ40 and pTau/Tau). More details about the method for immunohistochemistry and protein quantification are in http://help.brain-map.org/display/aging/Documentation. We included raw data of the multivariate analysis among AD-related proteins and autophagy genes in Table 4.

2.4.3 Data representation and codes.

Differences in absolute correlation between AD and Ctrl, and between NDAN and Ctrl, are shown as heat maps and boxplots, stratified by AD-related proteins. For preliminary analysis we used JMPpro, Version 16 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), for data visualization we used GraphPad Prism, Version 9, and R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, R Core Team, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2022, https://www.R-project.org/.

2.4.4 Statistical tests.

For the analysis of expression of autophagy genes (Table 3) we used one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison Tukey’s tests. We computed for each AD-related protein, the absolute values of its correlation with autophagy genes in AD subjects, the absolute values of its correlation with autophagy genes in Ctrl subjects, and boxplot the difference. We did the same for NDAN and Ctrl. The difference between AD and NDAN differences from Ctrl was then assessed with a paired t-test. For all statistical analyses p&lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. P values were indicated using asterisks: * &lt; 0.05; ** &lt; 0.01; *** &lt; 0.001; **** &lt; 0.0001. For statistical tests we used R studio software (Boston, MA) and GraphPad Prism, Version 9. All statistical tests are available in Table 2.

3. RESULTS

3.1 NDAN individuals display reduced tauopathy in the hippocampus

Based on our previous report that NDAN subjects have decreased Tau oligomers at synapses (24), we further investigate the expression of Tau and its phosphorylation status in human brains. Specifically, we performed a comparative study of human postmortem hippocampi of age-matched healthy individuals (Ctrl), AD patients and NDAN subjects. First, we compared the presence of Tau oligomers in Ctrl, AD and NDAN assessed with the Tau5 antibody (targeting amino acids 210–230) in total hippocampi homogenates and synaptosome preparations (Figure 1a). Western blot analyses confirmed our previous observations showing significantly reduced levels of Tau oligomers in NDAN as compared to AD. Then we investigated their phosphorylation assessed with phospho-Tau (pTau) antibodies: AT8 (Ser202/Thr205), AT180 (Thr231) and PHF13.6 (Ser396), among study groups, by WB. As shown in Figure 1b, we observed significantly decreased phosphorylated Tau and Tau oligomers in NDAN as compared to AD. Notably, the highest reductions were observed in degradation-resistant paired helical filament (PHF) Ser396 phosphorylation, a key pathological hallmark of AD (31). These results indicate that NDAN subjects, as compared to AD, have reduced Tau pathology to an extent similar to Ctrl that could thus protect cognitive integrity.

To evaluate the presence of Tau and pTau we performed double staining with Tau and PHF13.6 antibodies to detect total Tau and hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles, respectively, in Ctrl, AD, and NDAN individuals. As shown in Figure 1c, and as expected, we found very low immunoreactivity levels for both Tau and PHF13.6 in Ctrl brains, and significantly higher levels of total Tau and PHF13.6 in AD as compared to Ctrl and NDAN subjects. The images confirmed the reduced Tau pathology in NDAN as compared to AD subjects, as suggested by the significantly lower percent area occupied by hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles.

3.2 NDAN individuals display preserved autophagy

Our hypothesis is that reduction in Tau oligomers in the hippocampus is achieved through autophagy, and this mechanism maintains cognitive integrity in resilient individuals. To test our hypothesis, we performed a comparative study of human postmortem brains of age-matched Ctrl, AD patients and NDAN subjects, focusing on the expression of proteins involved in autophagy. We dissected the autophagic pathway focusing our attention on the different stages of the process, i.e., the membrane nucleation and phagophore formation and expansion (early stages), formation of autophagosome (middle stage), and fusion of the autophagosome with lysosomes (late stage) (32). First, we compared the expression of regulatory Beclin-1 and autophagy related genes (ATGs) involved in the early stages of the autophagic process in hippocampal tissue lysates from study subjects by Western blot and immunofluorescence. As shown in Figure 2a, compared to AD we found a significant increase of Beclin-1 (MW=52 kDa) protein levels (p&lt;0.02) in NDAN. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments and quantitative analyses (Figure 2b) where significantly higher immunoreactivity for Beclin1 was observed and quantified in NDAN hippocampi, as compared to AD samples.

We also found the levels of several ATG proteins significantly different in NDAN with respect to AD brains, namely Atg16L1 (MW = 68 kDa) (p&lt;0.02), Atg12 (MW=15 kDa, observed MW=48–55 kDa) (p&lt;0.01), Atg5 (MW= ~33 kDa, observed MW 56 kDa) (p&lt;0.008), Atg7 (MW=78 kDa) (p&lt;0.02) and Atg3 (MW=40 kDa) (p&lt;0.01), and Microtuble-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3AB) (MW=16–14 kDa) (p&lt;0.0005) (Figure 3a). Notably, in NDAN individuals the expression levels of these proteins involved in the phagophore formation/elongation and autophagosome completion (33) were similar to those in Ctrl subjects. Immunofluorescence experiments and quantitative analyses of hippocampal immunoreacted sections confirmed the significant increase of Atg16 L1 and LC3B in NDAN vs AD (Figure 3b). In addition, we examined the very late stage of the autophagy process, i.e., the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosomes. We analyzed the abundance of lysosomes, assessed by lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP1) (observed MW=~100 kDa), among study groups, by WB (Figure 4a). We observed significantly increased LAMP1 protein levels in AD and NDAN compared to Ctrl. These findings were supported by immunofluorescence data also showing higher levels of LAMP1 in AD and NDAN as compared to Ctrl subjects (Figure 4b). The lack of any differences in the lysosomal marker LAMP1 between AD and NDAN prompted us to investigate the proteasomal degradation pathway, particularly the expression levels of proteasome 20S subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5) (MW=27 kDa). Indeed, depending on the size/aggregation state and post-translation modification (i.e. ubiquitination, phosphorylation) Tau clearance occurs either via proteasome or autophagy (34–36). We found a significant increase of PSMA5 protein levels in NDAN as compared to AD, and similar levels between NDAN and Ctrl subjects. These findings were confirmed by IF analyses performed on hippocampal tissues (Figure 4 b–c).

3.3 Mitophagy is preserved in NDAN individuals

One of the best studied examples of selective autophagy involves the clearance of damaged organelles, particularly mitochondria, through a process called mitophagy (37). To assess the efficiency of autophagy organelle turnover, we examined the expression of selective autophagy receptors (SARs) involved in mitophagy in Ctrl, AD, and NDAN individuals. Using WB analysis, we observed significantly increased Optineurin (p&lt;0.03) (MW=66 kDa), nuclear domain 10 protein 52 (NDP52) (MW= 52 kDa) (p&lt;0.007), and Bcl2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3L) (MW= ~40 kDa) (p&lt;0.008), but not p62/SQSTM1 (p&lt;0.5) (MW=62 kDa) protein levels in NDAN compared to AD (Figure 5a), and no significant differences between Ctrl and NDAN subjects. These findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 5b, c), where levels of Optineurin and NDP52 were lower in the hippocampus of AD subjects compared to both NDAN and Ctrl.

3.4 Correlation between Tau and autophagy/mitophagy

To evaluate whether there was a relationship between autophagy and tauopathy, we performed correlation analyses between autophagic and Tau proteins. As shown Figure S2, autophagic proteins (Atg16L1 p&lt;0.005, Atg 5 p&lt;0.05, Atg 3 p&lt;0.02, LC3AB p&lt;0.04) and mitophagy receptors (Optineurin p&lt;0.03, NDP52 p&lt;0.02, BNIP3L p&lt;0.04) were negatively correlated to Tau oligomer (MW&gt;65 kDa), but not to total Tau (MW&gt;45kDa) (Figure S3). These results suggest that autophagy specific to Tau oligomer clearance functions as a protective mechanism preventing Tau pathology progression.

3.5 Transcription of autophagy genes is strongly related to levels of AD related proteins Tau and Aβ in NDAN

To further explore autophagy in the context of AD pathology and associated cognitive status, we investigated levels of AD related proteins Tau and Aβ and mRNA encoding key autophagic proteins in an independent cohort of Ctrl, AD, and NDAN donors. We used publicly available datasets from the ADTBI study (https://aging.brain-map.org/overview/home) which included: immunohistochemistry (IHC) and protein quantification (Luminex assay) of Tau and Aβ proteins species, as well as comprehensive RNA-Seq. For this analysis we used data from the hippocampi of Ctrl (Braak stage 0–3, cognitively normal), AD (Braak stage 4–6, demented), and NDAN (Braak stage 4–6, cognitively normal) individuals.

We first evaluated the pathology by testing levels of AD relevant proteins. As expected, one-way ANOVA revealed increased levels in AD and NDAN compared to Ctrl of pTau (T181), pTau/Tau, and immunoreactivity using IHC of Tau2 (total Tau) and AT8 (pTau, Ser202 and Thr205) (Figure 6b–e). Levels of total Tau did not show any differences among groups (Figure 6a). Luminex assay for Aβ42 and IHC using 6E10 showed increased levels in AD, and similar trend but not significant in NDAN compared to Ctrl (Figure 6g, i, Table 2). The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, as well as Aβ40, did not show any changes among groups (Figure 6f, h).

We then tested levels of 450 autophagy genes (GO:0006914, Table 3), of which 56 genes were overexpressed in Ctrl (38 vs NDAN, 18 vs AD); 67 in NDAN (43 vs Ctrl, 24 vs AD), and 34 in AD (18 vs Ctrl, 16 vs NDAN). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using the PANTHER (protein annotation through evolutionary relationship) classification system (http://www.pantherdb.org/ ) showed that in addition to autophagy, those genes that were significantly changed among groups were also part of other cellular pathways. Specifically, genes overexpressed in Ctrl were part of the cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) signaling map (8.9%) and the Insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway-protein kinase B signaling cascade (8.9%); genes overexpressed in AD were also part of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling pathway (5.9%); and genes overexpressed in NDAN were also part of the p53 pathway (4.5%), the Dopamine receptor mediated signaling pathway (4.5%), and the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor pathway (4.5%) (Table 3).

To test whether, in comparison to AD, NDAN individuals have a stronger modulation of the expression of mRNA encoding autophagy-related proteins in response to AD pathology, we performed Pearson’s correlation analysis between the 450 genes and the Tau and Aβ species in each group. We obtained 3 heat maps (Figure S4) showing that, regardless of correlation direction, NDAN had the strongest relationship between pathology and autophagy mRNA levels. Furthermore, to compare the autophagy response specifically between NDAN and AD we analyzed the correlation coefficients both as absolute value and as ΔNDAN (NDAN normalized by Ctrl) and ΔAD (AD normalized by Ctrl). In NDAN, we observed a significantly greater relationship between AD-related proteins and levels of autophagic genes (Figure 6j, k). Specifically, Tau, pTau, pTau/Tau, Aβ40, Aβ42, Aβ42/Aβ40, and IHC of AT8 showed higher correlation coefficients in NDAN compared to AD. In addition, to evaluate if autophagy was generally more responsive in NDAN compared to Ctrl, we repeated the same analysis in Δ’Ctrl (Ctrl normalized by AD) and Δ’NDAN (NDAN normalized by AD). We found that also in this case, NDAN displayed a stronger association between autophagy genes and AD-related proteins (Figure S5). These results indicate that in NDAN donors, transcription of autophagy genes is somewhat modulated by the presence of AD-related proteins, suggesting a new mechanism for defense against the accumulation of toxic proteins.

4. DISCUSSION

In this study, we evaluated autophagy as a key protective mechanism for cognitive integrity in NDAN subjects, through removal of Tau oligomers. In AD, the aberrant accumulation of Aβ and hyperphosphorylated Tau suggests a failure of the protein handling system. Indeed, growing evidence suggests that autophagy, the major cell mechanism responsible for removing protein aggregates, a primary route of clearance of Tau in healthy neurons, is dysregulated in AD (12,13,38). Furthermore, the impairment of the autophagy-lysosome system leads to the formation of Tau oligomeric and insoluble aggregates, while the induction of autophagy can significantly reduce their formation (21,22). Tau oligomers are more toxic to neurons than NFTs (39,40) and are strongly implicated in the synaptic dysfunction underlying memory deficits in AD. In our previous studies on NDAN subjects, we reported the absence of Aβ oligomers and decreased Tau oligomers at hippocampal synapses (24,41), preserved neurogenesis (42), preserved antioxidant response (43), and efficient removal of damaged synapses by hyper-active microglia (30). All these factors beneficially contribute to protective mechanisms fundamental for neuronal function and health.

Following these initial studies, here we investigated autophagy as one of the mechanisms involved in preservation of cognitive integrity in NDAN brains. We carried out a comprehensive study of human post-mortem hippocampi that included aged-matched groups, Ctrl, AD and NDAN, using Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. In parallel, we used publicly available RNA-seq data from the ADTBI study to interrogate the expression of autophagic genes in the context of AD pathology.

We first investigated levels of Tau oligomers and toxic aggregates in Ctrl, AD, and NDAN, by analyzing Tau oligomer expression and phospho-Tau levels. As we previously described (24,41), AD patients and NDAN subjects display Aβ and Tau pathology at very similar levels, but when we compared the expression of Tau oligomers assessed with Tau5 (amino acids 210–230) and their phosphorylation with different phospho-Tau antibodies, namely AT8 (Ser202/Thr205), AT180 (Thr231) and PHF13.6 (Ser396), we observed significantly reduced Tau oligomers and phospho-Tau in NDAN as compared to AD (Figure 1). It is worth to mention that Iqbal et al, (44,45) and Alonso et al, (46,47) showed that the oligomeric/dephosphorylated Tau rather than Tau filaments is the most toxic species. Therefore, the reduced levels of Tau oligomers in NDAN could potentially explain per se the difference in cognitive impairment between AD and NDAN. In addition, our findings also suggest that NDAN subjects activate a “scavenging” mechanism responsible for removal of Tau oligomers consistent with our previous observation regarding the absence of Aβ and Tau oligomers at the synapses (24,41). We therefore propose that NDAN individuals have reduced Tau pathology to an extent that protects cognitive integrity, due to removal of Tau oligomers by an efficient autophagic engulfment.

The expression of several autophagy-related proteins has been reported to be down-regulated in AD brains (18–20). Consistent with the literature, we found decreased levels of autophagic proteins in AD patients as compared to healthy controls. Specifically, we found that the proteins involved in the membrane nucleation (Beclin1), phagophore formation and expansion (ATGs), and completion of autophagosome (LC3) were significantly down regulated in our AD samples. Interestingly, these markers were significantly higher in NDAN as compared to AD (Figures 2–3), but at the same level as Ctrl, suggesting that autophagy is preserved and efficient at every level in NDAN individuals. Particularly, the significantly higher levels of LC3, considered a marker of autophagosomes number, detected in NDAN as compared to AD and controls, might represent a way for NDAN to cope with the Tau overload, and its subsequent engulfment inside the newly formed autophagosomes. Furthermore, increased expression of both Lamp1 and PSMA5 in NDAN compared to AD, suggests that the clearance of Tau in NDAN might efficiently occur through two different pathways, the autophagy-lysosomal and the proteasomal degradation pathways (Figure 4). In this context we have to mention that the conformational and aggregative states of Tau (i.e. monomeric, oligomeric, fibrillar), as well as its post-translational modifications (i.e. ubiquitination, phosphorylation) determine its degradation mechanism. For example, in aggrephagy, a selective autophagy process for protein aggregates, poly-ubiquitinated Tau oligomers as well as phosphorylated Tau are engulfed by the phagophore and extensively degraded into the lysosomes (34,35,48,49). However, ubiquitinated Tau can be also degraded by proteasomes (36).

Recently, a new non-canonical pathway, namely LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO) has been described in AD mouse models. LANDO was characterized in microglia cells as a critical regulator of Aβ clearance and receptor recycling including TLR4, TREM2, and CD36, protecting against neuronal loss and memory impairment (20). Importantly, the role of ATG16L1 is crucial in this pathway being responsible for the lipidation of LC3 and consequent formation of curved membrane and endosome (50). Furthermore, the high levels of ATG16L1 associated with high levels of LC3 in NDAN individuals might underlie a prevalence in these individuals of a non-canonical autophagy pathway involving microglia phagocytosis. This is consistent with the presence of hyper-phagocytic TREM2-microglia responsible for removal of damaged synapses that we previously reported in resilient NDAN individuals (30).

We observed significantly increased mitophagy receptors in NDAN subjects as compared to AD patients (Figure 5), suggesting preserved mitophagy. Specifically, we found upregulation of SARs, (i.e. Optineurin, NDP52 and BNIP3L) which play a key role in selective mitochondrial quality control mechanisms involving sequestration of defective mitochondria into autophagosomes for subsequent lysosomal degradation (51). The preservation of the mitophagy pathway correlates well with our previously published observation of decreased oxidative damage and preservation of mitochondrial proteins in NDAN as compared to AD (43). Moreover, SARs activation inhibits hyperphosphorylation of Tau in human neurons and restores cognitive dysfunctions in AD animal models (52). Hence, the lower levels of pTau we found in NDAN, might also correlate with the preserved levels of SARs that inhibit the phosphorylation of Tau.

When we correlated the expression of proteins involved in the autophagy and mitophagy pathways with Tau, we found that these proteins negatively correlated with Tau oligomers expression. Similarly, Caballero et al. reported that Tau is degraded through autophagy and capable of down regulating it (11). These results suggest that autophagy specific to Tau oligomer clearance is a protective mechanism preventing Tau pathology progression.

Complementary findings, using an independent cohort from the ADTBI, showed that several autophagy genes are differentially expressed in AD and NDAN compared to Ctrl (Table 3). We further found that the autophagy genes overexpressed in AD are also involved in the TGFβ signaling pathway. TGFβ is a pleiotropic cytokine that is involved in both suppressive and inflammatory immune responses (53). Proper activation of the inflammatory response is critical for scavenger cells in the CNS participating, for example, in Aβ clearance (54,55). Loss of inflammatory regulation by overproduction of TGFβ1, has been linked to cytotoxic features, establishing an inflammatory environment with increased oxidative stress, conditions that are amyloidogenic (56,57), disrupt BBB functioning, induce neuronal dysfunction (58), and accelerate deposition of Aβ peptides in animal models (59). However, one study reported an anti-amyloidogenic role of TGFβ1 in an AD mouse model (60).

We found that the autophagy genes overexpressed in NDAN were also part of the p53 pathway and the dopamine receptor mediated signaling pathway. P53 has been shown to have an important role in neurodegenerative disease and may be potentially neurotoxic or neuroprotective depending on the balance within its own isoforms (61). The dopaminergic system is significantly affected under AD pathology, and for this reason has been extensively studied (62). Decreased levels of dopaminergic neurotransmitters were linked with the pathophysiology of AD (63). When we evaluated the levels of AD-related proteins in the ADTBI cohort, consistent with our previous reports (24,41), we found high levels of Aβ and Tau in AD compared to Ctrl, and high levels of Tau and a similar trend of Aβ in NDAN compared to Ctrl. It is worth to mention that pTau species were pS202/pT205 (AT8, Figure 6e) and pT181 Tau (pTau and pTau/Tau Figure 6 b, c). Surprisingly, AT8 was not significantly different between AD and NDAN as we observed in the first cohort. This may be result of i) different detection method (WB for OHSU cohort, IHC for ADTBI cohort), ii) higher Braak stages of NDAN individuals in the ADTBI cohort compared to OHSU and iii) difference on the dissection protocol of the hippocampus between the two brain banks. However, NDAN showed a similar trend with lower mean levels of the two Tau species compare to AD. Taken all together, these results suggest that NDAN may have a slightly milder AD pathology in hippocampus compared to AD subjects.

The metabolism of Aβ and Tau species is affected by autophagy. Our study was primarily designed to investigate the strength of the association between mRNA encoding autophagy proteins and Aβ and Tau across examined groups. The NDAN group showed higher correlation coefficients compared to the AD group. These results suggest that certain individuals are more responsive than others to regulation of autophagy gene transcription in the presence of AD pathological insults. It is therefore prudent to propose that such increased responsiveness contributes to the observed resistance against cognitive decline by prompt culling of AD-related toxic proteins, particularly Tau.

In summary, here we report, for the first time, preserved autophagy as a key protective mechanism for cognitive integrity in NDAN subjects that remain resilient to cognitive decline despite the presence of AD protein neuropathology.

HIGHLIGHTS

NDAN subjects have preserved autophagic protein levels comparable with control subjects.

Compared to control subjects, NDAN subjects have significantly reduced Tau oligomers and PHF Tau phosphorylation at synapses that negatively correlate with autophagy markers.

Transcription of autophagy genes strongly associates with AD-related proteins in NDAN donors.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: A literature review was conducted using traditional sources (e.g., PubMed). There are several studies focused on the relationship between autophagy and Tau pathology in the context of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, no studies examine autophagy in relation to Tau pathology in individuals that are resilient to dementia despite having AD neuropathology (NDAN).

Interpretation of results: Our study indicated that preserved autophagy underlies reduced Tau pathology as one of the protective mechanisms in NDAN individuals.

Future direction: Our findings support the potential of autophagy-inducing strategies in AD therapeutics.
