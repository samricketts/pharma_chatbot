The continuous progression of neurological diseases are often categorized into conditions according to their severity. To relate the severity to changes in brain morphometry, there is a growing interest in replacing these categories with a continuous severity scale that longitudinal MRIs are mapped onto via deep learning algorithms. However, existing methods based on supervised learning require large numbers of samples and those that do not, such as self-supervised models, fail to clearly separate the disease effect from normal aging. Here, we propose to explicitly disentangle those two factors via weak-supervision. In other words, training is based on longitudinal MRIs being labelled either normal or diseased so that the training data can be augmented with samples from disease categories that are not of primary interest to the analysis. We do so by encouraging trajectories of controls to be fully encoded by the direction associated with brain aging. Furthermore, an orthogonal direction linked to disease severity captures the residual component from normal aging in the diseased cohort. Hence, the proposed method quantifies disease severity and its progression speed in individuals without knowing their condition. We apply the proposed method on data from the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=632). We then show that the model properly disentangled normal aging from the severity of cognitive impairment by plotting the resulting disentangled factors of each subject and generating simulated MRIs for a given chronological age and condition. Moreover, our representation obtains higher balanced accuracy when used for two downstream classification tasks compared to other pre-training approaches. The code for our weak-supervised approach is available at https://github.com/ouyangjiahong/longitudinal-direction-disentangle.

pmcI. Introduction

Individuals suffering from neurological diseases (such as cognitive impairment) are often categorized into conditions (such as stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI), progressive MCI (pMCI), and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) [1]). Accurately characterizing the effect of each condition on the human brain can contribute to a better understanding of the underlying neurological mechanisms and thus facilitate treatments in clinical settings. To do so, longitudinal MRI studies recruit normal controls and individuals of each condition, scan them repeatedly over time, and analyze their morphometric trajectories [2]‚Äì[4].

State-of-the-art analysis is often based on supervised learning of deep neural networks [4], [6]‚Äì[10] directly classifying longitudinal MRIs into normal controls and individuals associated with conditions of the disease (see Fig. 1(a)). However, supervised learning generally requires a large number of training samples for each condition, which are generally difficult to attain in longitudinal MRI studies [11]. Moreover, using exclusive labels to encode the classes ignores the underlying continuum across conditions regarding disease severity [9].

To reduce the need for large labelled training datasets, self-supervised learning models [12]‚Äì[20] derive a compact representation by mapping longitudinal MRIs into a latent space using label-independent information [5], [21]. One can then combine these self-supervised approaches with factor disentanglement [22]‚Äì[24] to extract directions in the latent space related to interpretable semantic information about the data. Common approaches for disentanglement (e.g., Œ≤-VAE [22], Œ≤-TCVAE [23], FactorVAE [24]) were created for cross-sectional data, so the disentangled factors generally do not relate to time-related information (e.g., aging and disease progression). Existing works on time-series data, like audio and video [25]‚Äì[27], attempted to disentangle the time-invariant content (e.g., identity) from time-variant content (e.g., human body pose). However, these models were not designed to encode changes captured by longitudinal neuroimaging data, e.g., aging and disease progression. To overcome this limitation, we proposed Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL) [5] (Fig. 1(c)), which uses the order of visits to ‚Äòsupervise‚Äô the disentanglement of brain aging encoded as a linear direction in the latent space. Our next model (referred to as LNE [28]) then relaxed the constraint of a single linear direction by deriving a non-linear smooth trajectory field. However, due to the absence of label information, both LSSL and LNE confined the disentanglement to one time-varying factor. Thus, these models assume that the effects of normal aging and disease progression lie on the same continuum so that they are encoded by the same direction in the latent space.

However, recent studies have shown that morphological brain changes associated with AD are different from normal aging [29]. To unravel these differences within a continuous space, we propose here a weakly supervised approach (Fig. 1(b)) that categorizes subjects as either normal control or diseased (i.e., belonging to one of the conditions). The direction associated with brain age is disentangled with respect to the control cohort by encouraging their aging trajectories to be fully encoded by that direction, while the direction linked to disease severity captures the residual after extracting ‚Äònormal aging‚Äô from the trajectories of diseased subjects. As normal controls are impartial to the severity, severity stages between individuals can be inferred solely from subject-specific progression without knowledge of their condition. By doing so, our model (similar to self-supervised approaches) can train on samples from conditions not of interest (e.g., AD subjects can be used for training when the primary analysis is on sMCI and pMCI).

We evaluated our method on disentangling brain age from cognitive impairment based on 632 longitudinal T1-weighted MRIs (ranging from 2 to 6 scans per participant) collected by the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The data set contained 185 NC, 193 sMCIs, 135 pMCIs, and 119 AD subjects. The weak label divides subjects into being normal controls or cognitively impaired (which was the collection of sMCI, pMCI, and AD). After training the model, plotting the disentangled factors of each sample in the latent space and simulating MRIs for any given chronological age and condition illustrates that the model properly disentangled normal aging from the severity of cognitive impairment. Note, the estimation of disease severity and disease progression speed cannot be produced by existing self-supervised or weakly-supervised methods. Moreover, compared to these alternative pre-training methods, the latent representation pre-trained by our model obtains higher balanced accuracy on two downstream tasks: distinguishing sMCI from pMCI, and predicting the presence of amyloid plaques on positron emission tomography (PET).

II. Method

We derive our approach by first defining the latent space of ‚Äòtrajectory vectors‚Äô where each vector represents the changes between two T1-weighted MRIs of a longitudinal sequence from the same subject (Section II-A). We then formalize the problem statement for disentangling the vectors into the effects associated with disease severity versus brain age (Section II-B). Finally, we encode this model via a loss function (Section II-C) and describe in Section II-D how to visualize the effect associated with a disentangled direction by generating synthetic brain MRIs. Note, for simplicity, we now drop the ‚ÄòT1-weighted‚Äô from MRI.

A. Deriving Trajectory Vectors

As shown in Fig. 2, our model consists of an autoencoding structure that maps each MRI (or visit) to a point in the latent space. In doing so, each subject is encoded in that space by a trajectory (light blue for normal controls and pink for diseased subjects) across multiple visits (‚â• 2). To reduce the problem of having an insufficient number of training samples, we do not directly train the model on the trajectories but instead compute vectors from all possible visit pairs, where the first visit in each pair precedes the second one. Note, the training weighs each MRI pair equally so that the model relies more on subjects with more observations.

We formalize a similar construction of the latent space as in [5]. Let ùí≥:={x1,‚Ä¶,xN} be the collection of all MRIs and ùíÆ be the set of subject-specific MRI pairs (xr, xs) with xr being scanned before xs. As shown in Fig. 2, the encoder F maps an MRI to an M-dimensional latent space via z:=F(x)‚àà‚ÑùM. An MRI pair (xr, xs) is then mapped to (zr := F(xr), zs := F(xx)). The normalized vector is formulated as Œîz(r,s) := (zs ‚àí zr)/Œît(r,s), where Œît(r,s) is the time interval between the two MRIs. For convenience, we denote Œîz(r,s) as Œîz, and Œît(r,s) as Œît from now on. From the latent representations, the decoder H then reconstructs the input MRIs, i.e., xÀúr:=H(zr), xÀús:=H(zs). The reconstruction loss is used to guarantee the latent representation encodes all morphological information in the MRIs, which can be formulated as: (1) Lrecon:=E(xr,xs)~ùíÆ(‚Äñxr‚àíxÀúr‚Äñ22+‚Äñxs‚àíxÀús‚Äñ22).

where E(xr,xs)~ùíÆ denotes the expected value with respect to all MRI pairs ùíÆ and ‚ïë ¬∑ ‚ïë2 represents the Euclidean norm.

B. Problem Statement

Our goal is to find two directions in the latent space, such that moving along one direction corresponds to normal aging (i.e., expected change induced by getting older) while moving along the other relates to disease progression. The remaining M ‚àí 2 dimensions then encode other time-independent factors (e.g., sex, race) that are not of interest to this longitudinal study. To achieve such disentanglement, we first introduce the weak binary label y as being 0 for normal controls or 1 for diseased subjects. Note, a disease (such as cognitive impairment) can encompass several conditions (e.g., sMCI, pMCI, or AD), where each condition is associated with a certain level of disease severity. To make this problem tractable, we make the following relaxing assumptions:

Completeness.

In line with many longitudinal studies of neurological diseases [30], [31], we assume that (brain) age and the severity of the disease are the only time-dependent factors. Thus, intra-subject changes captured by longitudinal brain MRIs can be fully explained by normal aging and disease progression, with disease progression only relevant to diseased adults (such as in the analysis of AD by ADNI [32], [33]).

Independence.

We assume aging and disease progression are two independent factors, so that disease progression can be explicitly disentangled from the normal aging effect by modeling the changes along two orthogonal directions in the latent space. In the case of AD, this assumption is supported by prior studies that AD can not be simply regarded as accelerated aging [29], [34].

Homogeneity.

While the two cohorts may not share the same distribution in age, we assume that their distribution over the speed of normal aging is the same. This assumption is needed as some conditions, such as AD, are associated with accelerated aging [29]. Thus, we consider aging speeds faster than normal as part of the disease as also done in [30], [35].

As shown in Fig. 2, we denote the brain age direction as œÑa and the disease severity direction as œÑd. These two directions are designed to be unit vectors and to be strictly orthogonal (inline with independence assumption), so that the high-dimensional representations can be projected into a 2D space spanned by these two orthogonal directions (Fig. 2). Given the latent representation z of an MRI, we define the projection value of z on the disease severity direction as the estimated disease severity associated with that MRI, i.e., œÜd := zTœÑd. The projection on the age direction, i.e., œÜa := zTœÑa, is the estimated brain age. Now let Œîz be associated with an MRI pair with ŒîœÜa being the estimated aging speed between visits, then the component on the age direction can be computed by projecting Œîz on œÑa, i.e., Œîza := (ŒîzTœÑa)œÑa = ŒîœÜaœÑa. Similarly, let ŒîœÜd be the estimated progression speed capturing the changes in disease severity between visits, then the component on the disease severity direction is Œîzd := (ŒîzTœÑd)œÑd = ŒîœÜdœÑd.

The completeness assumption suggests that Œîz = Œîza + Œîzd, i.e., the longitudinal changes are the combination between normal aging and the disease progression. For normal controls ideally we have Œîz = Œîza. An exact disentanglement would thus satisfy (2) Œîz‚àíŒîza‚àíy‚ãÖŒîzd=0

for each subject, while the distribution of aging speed ŒîœÜa is the same for the two cohorts (according to the homogeneity assumption).

C. Loss Functions

We now design an objective function, whose minimum achieves the condition of disentanglement (i.e., Eq. (2)). Simply defining this function by the L2-norm over the left-hand side of Eq. (2) will lead to a non-informative solution, which is shrinking the magnitude of z towards zero. To avoid this scenario, we now derive a cost function that instead minimizes the cosine loss between vectors [5].

For normal controls, œÑa should be parallel to the trajectory vector Œîz. To impose this constraint in the model, we define the first term of the cost function to be a cosine loss favoring zero-angle between the two vectors, i.e., (3) Lda:=E(xr,xs)~ùíÆ,y=0(‚àícos(Œ∏‚å©Œîz,œÑa‚å™)).

Note, ùíÆ, y = 0 denotes the MRI pairs of normal controls so that, unlike in our prior work [5], the expected value is only over the normal controls. In [5], the constraint applied to both cohorts, which violates our homogeneity assumption as the function does not distinguish between normal and accelerated aging.

Moreover, we add a loss term based on the Kullback‚ÄìLeibler (KL) divergence to explicitly impose the homogeneity assumption of having ‚Äòidentical distribution of aging speed‚Äô for the two cohorts. More specifically, assuming the distribution of the aging speed is captured by the normal distribution ùí©(Œº0,œÉ0) for normal controls and ùí©(Œº1,œÉ1) for the diseased cohort, then the KL loss is defined as: (4) Lkl:=log(œÉ1œÉ0)+(œÉ02+(Œº0‚àíŒº1)22œÉ12)‚àí12.

To enforce the completeness assumption, we propose a penalty loss term based on the ratio of the norm of ŒîœÜd between the normal controls and diseased cohort: (5) Lpen:=Ey=0‚ÄñŒîœÜd‚Äñ2Ey=1‚ÄñŒîœÜd‚Äñ2.

Note, the minimum of that ratio is achieved when Ey=0‚ïëŒîœÜd‚ïë2 = 0, i.e., normal controls have no disease component.

Finally, for diseased subjects, the residual of the age direction (i.e., Œîz‚àíŒîza) should be parallel to the disease severity direction œÑd. We model this assumption via (6) Ldd:=E(xr,xs)~ùíÆ,y=1(‚àícos(Œ∏‚å©Œîz‚àíŒîza,œÑd‚å™)).

In doing so, the proposed method can be applied to scenarios where diseases can be either relevant or irrelevant to brain age.

The complete objective function, whose minimum fulfills the requirement of Eq. (2), is then the weighted combination of prior loss functions, i.e., (7) L:=ŒªreconLrecon+ŒªaLda+ŒªdLdd+ŒªpenLpen+Lkl,

where Œªrecon, Œªa, Œªd, and Œªpen are hyperparameters that balance the losses.

D. Visualizing the Effect of Normal Aging and Disease

With the disentangled directions, we can visualize the effect of normal aging by reconstructing the average brain MRI of the control cohort, whose z varies along the age direction. The disease effect can be visualized by varying z along the disease severity direction to reconstruct diseased MRIs. Let {zi|i = 1, ...,NC} be the latent representations of NC normal controls, we generate a simulated MRI of controls x^C at a given brain age œÜ^a by reconstructing the following latent representation (8) z^C:=œÜ^aœÑa+1NC‚àëi=1NC[zi‚àíœÜaiœÑa],

where the first term corresponds to the component along the age direction and the second term captures the factors independent from brain age, i.e., the group average of the components orthogonal to œÑa.

Assuming the disease consists of K conditions of various severity levels, the simulated brain MRI at age œÜ^a for the kth condition (with NDk subjects) can be reconstructed from: (9) z^Dk=œÜ^aœÑa+(1NDk‚àëi=1NDkœÜdi)œÑd+1NDk‚àëi=1NDk(zi‚àíœÜaiœÑa‚àíœÜdiœÑd),

where the first term is the aging component, the second term corresponds to disease severity, and the last term captures the factors independent from brain age and disease.

III. Experimental Setup

A. Data

We evaluated our method on 632 subjects‚Äô longitudinal T1w MRIs (consisting of 2389 individual MRIs that successfully were pre-processed) from ADNI-1. Each subject had at least two (and up to 6) T1w MRI scans (Table I)), which were acquired via a 1.5T 3D MPRAGE sequence defined across GE, Siemens, and Phillips scanners (TR/TE = 2300‚Äì3000/3‚Äì4 ms; flip angle = 8‚Äì9¬∞; section thickness = 1.2 mm; 256 reconstructed axial sections) [36]. According to ADNI, electronic protocols were supplied to each MRI scanner vendor to minimize inconsistencies expected to arise from building the protocol manually on individual scanners and the imaging protocol remained the same for each individual during the study period of ADNI-1 [37].

The data set consists of 185 normal controls (age: 75.57 ¬± 5.06 years), 119 subjects with AD (age: 75.17 ¬± 7.57 years), 135 subjects diagnosed with pMCI (age: 75.91 ¬± 5.35 years), and 193 subjects diagnosed with sMCI (age: 75.63 ¬± 6.62 years). pMCI is defined as those MCI subjects that progressed into AD within 3 years after baseline, whereas sMCI did not [38]. There was no significant age difference among sMCI, pMCI and AD individuals (p &gt;0.3, two-sample t-test).

We assigned a binary weak label to each individual with y = 0 for normal controls and y = 1 for cognitively impaired individuals, which include sMCI, pMCI, or AD subjects. There was no significant age difference (p=0.62; two-sample t-test) between controls (age: 75.57 ¬± 5.06 years) and the cognitive impaired group (75.59 ¬± 6.42 years).

In line with our prior studies [5], [10], [28], all longitudinal MRIs were preprocessed by a pipeline composed of denoising, bias field correction, skull striping, affine registration to a template, re-scaling to a 64√ó64√ó64 volume, and transforming image intensities to z-scores. At the sacrifice of image resolution, the downsampling enables the design of a compact encoder model with a relatively small number of network parameters, which can effectively boost training speed. Finally, we constructed 2668 MRI pairs by the criteria that each pair was from the same subject and scans were at least one year apart (i.e., contain sufficient morphological changes).

B. Implementation Details

We augmented the training set as we did in [28], i.e., by applying the same random shift (within 4 pixels), rotation (within 2 degrees) and random flipping of brain hemispheres on each pair of MRIs. By doing so, we preserve the intra-subject changes that our model aims to learn (i.e., aging and disease effects). This augmentation strategy also allowed for direct comparison with our previous works [5], [28]. Regarding the architecture, our model was based on an Encoder-Decoder structure [39]. Specifically, let EBk denote an Encoder Block, i.e. a stack of Convolution layer (k channels, kernel size of 3 √ó 3 √ó 3) followed by a BatchNorm, LeakyReLU (with slope of 0.2) and a MaxPool layer (kernel size of 2), and DBk as Decoder Block, i.e., a stack of Convolution layer (k channels, kernel size of 3√ó3√ó3) followed by a BatchNorm, LeakyReLU (with slope of 0.2) and a MaxPool layer (kernel size of 2). Then the architecture of our model was a EB16-EB32-EB64-EB16-DB64-DB32-DB16-DB16 followed by a convolution layer for the final reconstruction. As shown in Fig. 3, the encoder resulted in a 1024-dimensional representation space. We estimate œÑa and œÑd by regarding them as the output of two dummy layers. Specifically, a dummy constant scalar of 1 was fed to a dense layer (top orange block) producing the 1024 dimensional vector œÑa, where we denote the first 1023 dimensions as œÑa‚Ä≤ and the last dimension as œÑa". The constant was also fed to a separate dense layer (bottom orange block) producing another 1023 dimensional vector œÑd‚Ä≤, which was then concatenated with ‚àíœÑa‚Ä≤‚ä§œÑd‚Ä≤œÑa" to produce the final 1024 dimensional œÑd. By design, œÑd was orthogonal to œÑa, both of which were then turned into unit vectors via normalization.

Due to the complexity of the objective function, and inspired by the idea of curriculum learning [40], [41], we designed a coarse-to-fine step-wise training strategy that gradually added loss terms to the objective function. On all training subjects, we first optimized over ŒªreconLrecon +ŒªaLda so that disease progression was modelled as an accelerated aging effect. We then added the loss function associated with the disease severity direction (i.e., ŒªreconLrecon+ŒªaLda+ŒªdLdd) to disentangle the disease progression from normal aging. Finally, the disentanglement was further improved by minimizing the entire object function as specified in Eq. (7) In line with LSSL [5], we set Œªrecon and Œªa to be equal as the number of MRIs (N=2389) is about the same as the number of MRI pairs (N=2668). We then set the weights for the remaining regularization terms to be half of Œªrecon so that the loss values of all terms are of equal scale. The networks were trained for 25 epochs by the Adam optimizer [42] with learning rate of 5 √ó 10‚àí4 and weight decay of 10‚àí5 for each of the three phases.

C. Evaluation

The approach was evaluated in two steps. We first ensured that brain aging was accurately disentangled from disease severity. Next, we assessed the use of this disentanglement for downstream tasks by comparing its accuracy to those of alternative approaches on several clinically-relevant tasks.

Quality of disentanglement in the latent space:

A successful disentanglement would result in the direction œÑd stratifying the severity level of cognitive impairment within the diseased individuals. To assess the quality of the stratification, we first trained the model using the weak labels of all subjects and then examined whether the resulting representations could differentiate sMCI, pMCI, and AD within the diseased cohort. To do so, we selected trajectory vectors Œîz associated with adjacent visits of each subject and examined the differences in ŒîœÜa (aging speed) and ŒîœÜd (disease progression speed) across cohorts by two-tailed two-sample t-tests (p &lt; 0.05 was viewed as significant). We followed up this quantitative analysis by projecting the trajectory vector Œîz as a dot in the 2D space spanned by the age direction œÑa and disease severity direction œÑd. We color-coded the dots by cohorts to visualize their differences in the Œîzd component.

In a second experiment, we inspected the correlation between the estimated progression speed and the changing speed of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Assessment Scale‚ÄìCognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog). ADAS-Cog quantifies the severity of cognitive impairment by having subjects complete 11 tasks that assess the cognitive domains of memory, language, and praxis. The outcome of this assessment is a single value ranging from 0 to 70 with higher scores suggesting worse cognition [43]. In line with the computation of ŒîœÜd, we defined the changing speed of ADAS-cog as the difference in ADAS-cog between the two visits divided by the time interval. Finally, the above two experiments were repeated on œÜd; i.e, we tested the difference in œÜd across the three conditions and correlated œÜd with ADAS-Cog.

Evaluating Quality of Representations for Two Downstream Tasks:

Distinguishing MCI subjects who will eventually develop AD (pMCI) from stable MCI subjects (sMCI) within a short time frame (3 years) is helpful to identify patients who may need more medical care or may be appropriate to include in clinical trials of AD disease modifying therapies. To highlight the potential clinical value of the proposed method, the first downstream task was on sMCI vs. pMCI classification.

For the second downstream task, we used the learned representations to predict brain amyloid status (i.e., positive vs. negative status) [44]. The presence of brain Œ≤-amyloid (AŒ≤) plaques is a defining feature of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Traditionally, PET imaging using AŒ≤-specific radiotracers (such as 18-florbetapir) is used to quantify brain AŒ≤ plaque load. However, PET imaging is expensive and exposes the subjects to radiation. Moreover, PET is not available in majority of the hospitals around the world. Thus, predicting this PET biomarker from MRIs is significant for AD diagnosis. As MRI and PET acquisition were usually not acquired in the same visit by ADNI and subjects visits were generally 6-months apart, we considered the amyloid status derived from the 18F-AV45 PET acquired within 3 months from an MRI visit as the ‚Äòground truth‚Äô of that visit. As suggested by prior longitudinal studies [45]‚Äì[47], we used the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) for each PET scan based on a composite reference region consisting of cerebellum, brainstem/pons, and eroded cortical white matter (described in ‚ÄòUC Berkeley - AV45 Analysis Methods‚Äô which is available on ADNI [48]). Following the definition in [49], [50], an SUVR above 0.79 was labelled positive and otherwise the scan was labelled as negative.

Considering our method as a pre-training scheme that provides a representation that can potentially benefit downstream supervised tasks, we pre-trained the encoder based on our disentanglement approach on all subjects. Afterward, we assessed the accuracy of the resulting representation with respect to each of the two downstream tasks via five-fold cross-validation. For each run, one fold was used for testing, while the remaining folds were utilized for training, among which 10% subjects were held out for validation. The 5 folds were split based on subjects so that all MRIs of a subject were assigned to the same fold. For sMCI vs. pMCI classification, we tested on two types of input features: 1) a visit-level prediction used z of each visit; and an MRI-pair-level prediction concatenated z of the first visit with Œîz between visits, denoted as z &amp; Œîz. The prediction target was always the sMCI vs. pMCI label of the subject. Using each feature type, we trained the classifier in two settings. We first performed the classification directly on the features (frozen) using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) [51] with two dense layers of dimension 1024 and 64 with LeakyReLU activation [52]. In the second setting, we fine-tuned the features by incorporating the encoder F before the MLP classifier and trained the entire model in an end-to-end manner. Classification accuracy was measured by balanced accuracy (BACC) [53] accounting for different number of training samples in each group. We also conducted an ablation study to examine the impact of omitting the two regularization terms (Eq. 4, 5) on the BACC. Lastly, the cross-validation was repeated for PET amyloid status classification. Since the status was defined per visit, the prediction target was the status at the second visit when using z &amp; Œîz as input features.

We compared the BACC to models using the same architecture with encoders pre-trained by other representation learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no longitudinal approach that can disentangle aging and disease effects within a latent space. We therefore compared to unsupervised (AE [54], VAE [39]) and self-supervised (SimCLR [55], LSSL [5], LNE [28]) methods. Specifically, we adapted SimCLR to our longitudinal setting by treating two MRIs of the same subject (with the same shift and rotation augmentation) as a positive pair for self-supervised training [55]. Next, we also implemented several weakly supervised methods (see first column of Table II) for pre-training the encoder. First, wMLP concatenated the encoder with an MLP classifier [51] to predict the binary weak label, while a C-VAE [56] learned the latent representation of each MRI conditioned on its binary label. We also expanded the LSSL approach to work with weak labels by implementing two variants: similar to wMLP, wLSSL1 consisted of the encoder followed by a classifier in order to estimate the weak binary label; wLSSL2 estimated two label-specific directions in the latent space by using two cosine losses, one computed with respect to the controls and the other with respect to the diseased cohort. Table II summarizes the properties of all methods used in our comparison.

IV. Results

We now review the findings of the experiments in the order they were described in the prior section.

A. Plotting Disentangled Values

As the proposed method performed disentanglement by focusing on the differences within pairs of MRIs, we first review our findings with respect to the aging speed ŒîœÜa and the progression speed ŒîœÜd (Fig. 4) and then complement those findings by analyzing age œÜa and disease severity œÜd (Fig. 6).

Fig. 4(a) shows no significant difference in aging speed ŒîœÜa between the control (NC) and the cognitive impairment (CI) cohort (p=0.25). This indicates the KL loss Lkl (Eq. (4)) effectively extracted a common pattern of normal aging across the two cohorts. That the normal aging was similar across cohorts is further supported by Fig. 5(a), which shows similar developmental patterns across cohorts. The pattern for each cohort was created by subtracting the synthetic MRI (see also Section II-D) at age 60 years (first column) from that at different ages. Note, the estimated brain age significantly correlated with the actual chronological age (p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 6(a)) so that the chronological ages were related to the estimated brain ages œÜa based on a linear function that mapped the range (i.e., max and min values) of brain ages to the one of chronological ages.

Furthermore, normal controls had close to zero progression speed (shown by the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 4(b)+(d)) indicating the efficacy of the regularization Lpen. However, when investigating the progression speed of the three conditions (Fig. 4(c)+(d)), sMCI had significantly smaller ŒîœÜd compared to pMCI and AD (p &lt; 0.01). Beyond progression speed, the disease severity of sMCI subjects was lower than those with pMCI or AD (both with p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 6(b)). These findings are visually confirmed by the differences in simulated MRIs of each cohort to that of the normal controls at a specific age (Fig. 5(b)). While for all conditions we observed enlarged ventricle and brain atrophy, those morphological changes were least pronounced for sMCI. Furthermore, sMCI converged with increasing age to the brain of normal controls, while brains from pMCI and AD had visually distinct yet less pronounced morphological changes compared to effects at younger ages. These results agree with recent findings that brain atrophy of early onset AD patients is distinctly different to age-matched controls, but less so when comparing older AD patients from older controls [57].

The progression speed estimated by our method also aligned well with the actual speed of cognition decline, as larger ŒîœÜd corresponded to faster ADAS-cog decline (light yellow in Fig. 7(a)). The Pearson correlation (r=0.27, p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 7(b)) between the two variables was achieved solely using T1 structural data without supervision on ADAS-cog. Interestingly, the regression line (in red) almost goes through the origin of that coordinate system indicating that when no progression in disease severity was detected by our model then this accurately reflected stability in the cognitive score. Beyond progression speed, disease severity itself was correlated with the ADAS-cog score (p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 6(c)). Interestingly, the slope of the fitted lines was larger in AD than pMCI, which suggests the difference in ADAS-cog score between the two cohorts was more pronounced than the difference in the estimated disease severity. This is potentially due to the fact that cognitive impairment is not only associated with structural brain changes but also with functional ones [58]. Thus changes cannot be solely explained by structural biomarkers [59] and hence requires further multi-modal analysis.

In summary, all these findings suggest that the proposed method not only properly disentangled brain age from disease severity (p&gt;0.1 for Pearson‚Äôs correlation) but also was able to learn the progression of cognitive impairment from the ordinal information of subject-specific MRI pairs without knowledge about ADAS-cog or the three conditions (sMCI, pMCI, and AD).

B. sMCI vs. pMCI classification

According to Table III, the representations learned by the proposed method achieved significantly more accurate predictions (p &lt; 0.05, DeLong‚Äôs test) than all baselines in 3 out of 4 scenarios. The one exception was using z and fine-tuning the encoder, in which case LNE [28] achieved the highest accuracy (69.6%) as it can explicitly model non-linear aging directions. Another observation is that the accuracy of the proposed method using z and Œîz (a.k.a., z &amp; Œîz) with a frozen encoder was more accurate (70.9%) than any implementation just relying on z (including those with fine-tuned encoders). This indicates the progression speed of cognitive impairment was an important marker for distinguishing pMCI from sMCI. This would also explain why cross-sectional methods were generally outperformed by longitudinal ones as the latter explicitly modeled the morphological change between time points, which led to more accurate estimates of Œîz than computed by cross-sectional models.

Compared with the model that directly classifies sMCI and pMCI individuals (i.e., ‚ÄòNo pretrain‚Äô), the proposed method pre-trained the encoder by augmenting the data set with the control and AD subjects. Unlike other unsupervised or weakly-supervised pre-training schemes (i.e., wMLP, C-VAE, wLSSL1 and wLSSL2), our model leveraged the weak label (without knowing the condition) to explicitly disentangle the disease factor from the aging factor, which is particularly beneficial for modeling stages of severity where each stage is represented by a limited number of training samples. This statement is supported by excluding the AD cohort in pre-training resulting in a significant drop in balanced accuracy from 70.9 to 70.1 (p &lt; 0.05, DeLong‚Äôs test) in the sMCI vs. pMCI classification (based on z &amp; Œî z and a frozen encoder). This conclusion is further supported by reported accuracy score of 74.2% of our method that is higher than any other published accuracy on sMCI vs. pMCI classification just relying on structural MRI (Table IV).

Ablation study.

As we have qualitatively shown the importance of Lkl (Eq. (4)) (ensures the homogeneity assumption of having same distribution of aging speed) and Lpen (Eq. 5) (enforces the completeness assumption that normal aging can fully explain the changes in MRI for the control cohort) for disentanglement in Section IV-A, we now quantitatively assess their impact on the BACC in the sMCI vs. pMCI classification task. As shown in Table V, using all loss terms during pre-training obtained the highest accuracy for three settings compared to omitting either regularization term, while omitting both terms achieved the worst performance. In the scenario of using z as input features and fine-tuning the encoder, omitting Lpen resulted in slightly higher accuracy (68.5%) than including it (68.4%), which was much lower than the overall highest accuracy of our implementation (74.2%). This demonstrates the necessity of each proposed component in learning informative representations stratifying disease severity across conditions.

C. Amyloid status classification

As shown in Table VI, the proposed method yielded the best accuracy of classifying amyloid status in all four scenarios, suggesting the superiority of the representations learned by our method. By disentangling the disease progression from normal aging, representation z captured more information about the status of AD, which was correlated with amyloid status. Unlike for sMCI vs. pMCI classification, including Œîz in the classifier did not greatly boost accuracy, which indicates that the amyloid status might be less related to the progression speed but rather the severity of cognitive impairment.

V. Discussion

The advantage of the proposed method is that it explicitly disentangles the disease progression from normal aging. Thus, our model provides a unique way to understand the disease status (severity and progression) by directly learning from the longitudinal MRIs rather than using human-defined metrics related to the disease. More specifically, our proposed method captures a disease via œÜd representing disease severity and ŒîœÜd encoding the progression speed of a disease. Moreover, it yields an intuitive way for interpreting and visualizing the representation, i.e., projecting the high dimensional representation into 2D-space supported by the aging and disease directions, as shown in Fig. 5(d) and Fig. 7(a).

Beyond those advantages, the accuracy of our method could be negatively impacted by the completeness assumption, i.e., that any longitudinal changes are only caused by aging and the disease (see Section II). In practice, longitudinal changes are also caused by other time-dependent factors, such as diseases whose risk increases with age [69] and AD comorbidities [70]‚Äì[73]. Those factors are only implicitly accounted for as they are either modeled as part of aging (if they are independent of AD), disease severity (if they related to AD), or captured by the remaining vectors (those that are orthogonal to both aging and disease severity).

Second, confounding effects of time-invariant factors (such as sex) were not considered during training. We studied the effect of sex via a post-hoc analysis, which revealed that the male cohort had a significant higher brain age œÜa and disease severity œÜd (both p &lt; 0.01, two-sample t-test) than the female one. These findings align with the demographics of the ADNI data set as the male cohort was significantly older and contained a significantly higher percentage of cognitive impaired subjects than the female cohort (both p &lt; 0.01). However, the sex difference was not significant for aging speed ŒîœÜa (p=0.1) and progression speed ŒîœÜd (p=0.07).

Lastly, in our experiments, the proposed method was pre-trained on the whole dataset, but it has the potential to be embedded into a cross-validation setting. To prove this concept, we also applied the pre-trained method on a separate hold-out dataset consisting of 200 MRI pairs of 200 subjects (50 subjects for each cohort) from the ADNI2/3 data set (i.e., no overlapping with the pre-trained dataset). The cohorts in the hold-out set were age matched to the pre-trained dataset (p &gt; 0.05, t-test). As on pre-trained data set (Fig. 4 (b)(c)), the progression speed measured on the hold-out set of pMCI or AD subjects was significantly faster than NC or sMCI (p &lt; 0.01 for all four comparisons including NC vs. pMCI, NC vs. AD, sMCI vs. pMCI, and sMCI vs. AD). Furthermore, the BACC for the sMCI vs. pMCI classification for the frozen encoder with respect to z was 61.4 %, which is insignificantly different to the 62.2 % reported in Table III (p &gt; 0.1, Fisher‚Äôs exact test). Insignificantly different was also the difference in BACC with respect to the frozen encoder applied to z&amp;Œîz, for which we recorded 70.3% (versus 70.9 %, p &gt; 0.1, Fisher‚Äôs exact test) on the hold-out dataset. Moreover, the model with the fine-tuned encoder also had a balanced accuracy of 68.2 % (vs. 68.4 %) using z and 73.5% (vs. 74.2 %) using z&amp;Œîz (both have p &gt; 0.1, Fisher‚Äôs exact test). In other words, our derived encoder can generalize to unseen data.

VI. Conclusion

In this work, we proposed a representation learning framework based on weakly-supervised learning that takes advantage of the repeated MRI scans acquired by longitudinal studies to explicitly disentangle normal brain aging and disease progression. When applied to analyze the longitudinal T1-weighted MRIs from ADNI, the proposed method not only accurately quantified the severity level and the dynamic progression speed of cognitive impairment associated with sMCI, pMCI, and AD, but also visualized for each condition the effects of the disease on brain morphometry. When used as a pre-training strategy, our method resulted in latent representations with superior accuracy in differentiating sMCI from pMCI and positive from negative amyloid status compared with the ones learned by other unsupervised and self-supervised methods.

Cyan arrows are of normal controls while arrows in yellow, purple, and brown are of subjects diagnosed with a condition. The background color represents the label used in the fully and weakly supervised setting. Note, while weakly-supervised learning (b) trains on subjects of all conditions (represented by arrows with four different colors), it only uses binary weak label to distinguish controls (cyan background) from diseased subjects (pink backgrounds).

Fig. 2. Overview of our method: an encoder projects a pair of MRIs (xr, xs) into the latent space resulting in a trajectory vector with (light) blue for normal controls and pink (or red) for diseased subjects. We encourage the direction of this vector to be consistent with the age direction œÑa (blue) for normal controls and the residual of that direction to be consistent with the disease severity direction œÑd (red) for diseased individuals.

Fig. 3. Network structure of the proposed method. Blue blocks correspond to the encoder that reduces an input MRI to a 1024 dimensional latent representation z, from which the decoder (green) reconstructs the MRI. œÑa and œÑd are constructed as the output of a dummy network. The last dimension of œÑd enforces the orthogonality constraint œÑa ‚ä• œÑd. The relationship between variables is further illustrated in Fig. 2.

In all sub-figures, black dashed lines correspond to zero. Note, we omitted from the axes their scale as the absolute value of aging speed and progression speed has no practical meaning.
