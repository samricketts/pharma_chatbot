We report a microglial phagocytosis/cell health high content assay that has been used to support our drug discovery projects targeting microglia for Alzheimer’s disease therapy and test small molecule chemical probes. The assay measures phagocytosis and cell health (cell count and nuclear intensity) simultaneously in 384-well plates processed with automatic liquid handler, a mix-and-read live cell imaging assay. The assay is highly reproducible with capacity to meet drug discovery research needs. Assay procedures take 4 days including plating cells, treating cells, adding pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris to cells for phagocytosis, staining cell nuclei before performing high content imaging and analysis. Three selected parameters are measured from cells: 1) mean total fluorescence intensity per cell of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris in phagocytosis vesicles to quantify phagocytosis; 2) cell counts per well (measuring compound effects on proliferation and cell death), and 3) average nuclear intensity (measuring compound induced apoptosis). The assay has been used on HMC3 cells (an immortalized human microglial cell line), BV2 cells (an immortalized mouse microglial cell line), and primary microglia isolated from mouse brains. Simultaneous measurements of phagocytosis and cell health allows for the distinction of compound effects on regulation of phagocytosis from cellular stress/toxicity related changes, a distinguishing feature of the assay. The combination of cell counts and nuclear intensity as indicators of cell health is also an effective way to measure cell stress and compound cytotoxicity, which may have broad applications as simultaneous profiling measurements for other phenotypic assays.

pmcINTRODUCTION:

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain parenchyma, play critical functions to maintain homeostasis in the brain tissue environment, ensuring normal neuronal activities (Kettenmann, Hanisch, Noda, &amp; Verkhratsky, 2011; Nimmerjahn, Kirchhoff, &amp; Helmchen, 2005; Salter &amp; Stevens, 2017; Wake, Moorhouse, Miyamoto, &amp; Nabekura, 2013). Cleaning debris of dead cells and extracellular abnormal protein aggregates through phagocytosis is the major homeostasis function of microglia (Edler, Mhatre-Winters, &amp; Richardson, 2021; Ennerfelt et al., 2022; Franco-Bocanegra et al., 2021; Mundt, Greter, &amp; Becher, 2022; Nizami, Hall-Roberts, Warrier, Cowley, &amp; Di Daniel, 2019; Witting, Muller, Herrmann, Kettenmann, &amp; Nolte, 2000). Decline of phagocytosis activity has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains (Lewcock et al., 2020; Mundt et al., 2022), especially in plaque associated microglia (Gyoneva, Swanger, Zhang, Weinshenker, &amp; Traynelis, 2016; Plescher et al., 2018). Accumulation of Aβ plaques and Tau tangles in AD brains suggest that microglia lack the capacity to maintain homeostasis in diseased brains, and that this deficiency contributes to the neurodegenerative pathology leading to dementia. We hypothesize that targeting microglia with therapeutic small molecule agents to stimulate phagocytosis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Selected targets include main regulators of TREM2 signaling pathway, such as INPP5D and PLCG2, which have been identified as risk factors related to AD pathogenesis (Andreone et al., 2020; Ennerfelt et al., 2022; Lewcock et al., 2020; Nugent et al., 2020). Since TREM2 regulates microglial phagocytosis activities, quantitative measurement of phagocytosis can be a phenotypic assay to test cellular efficacy for drug discovery projects targeting the pathway. Safety of potential drug molecules is another important factor to be monitored during drug discovery studies. Learning from various reported assays measuring phagocytosis via cellular imaging (Andreone et al., 2020; Phanse et al., 2012; Vance et al., 2016; Witting et al., 2000; Yeo, Wall, Stow, &amp; Hamilton, 2013) or flow cytometry (Harvath &amp; Terle, 1999; Meena, Goswami, Anish, &amp; Panda, 2021; Phanse et al., 2012), we developed and established a cellular assay that can measure both the efficacy by quantifying microglial phagocytosis, and simultaneously measure cell health, while maintaining the capacity and reproducibility required for guiding the drug discovery process. This microglial phagocytosis/cell health high content assay is presented here. The simultaneous measurements of phagocytosis and cell health enables the identification of regulation of microglial phagocytosis in the absence of cell stress/toxicity caused by compounds, a distinguishing feature of the assay. The combination of cell counts and nuclear intensity for cell health is also an effective way to measure cell stress and compound cytotoxicity, and this strategy of simultaneous profiling measurements may have broad applications for other phenotypic assays.

BASIC PROTOCOL

Basic protocol title: Microglial phagocytosis/cell health high content assay protocol

Introduction

The assay introduced here is a simplified cellular imaging assay with no fixation and any washing step, while producing multiparameter measurements and with high capacity using 384-well plate format. The assay procedures include plating cells on day 1, incubating cell plates overnight before treating cells on day 2, adding pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris to cell plates on day 3, and 20 hours later, staining cell nuclei with Hoechst-33342 for 30 min before performing high content imaging on day 4. Three selected parameters are measured from cells: 1) mean total fluorescence intensity per cell of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris in phagocytosis vesicles, to quantify phagocytosis; 2) cell counts per well to quantify treatment effects on proliferation and cell death, and 3) average nuclear intensity to quantify treatment induced nuclear changes such as in apoptosis. The assay has been used on HMC3 cells (an immortalized human microglial cell line), BV2 cells (an immortalized mouse microglial cell line), and primary microglia isolated from mouse brains. For initial trying the assay, we recommend using the HMC3 cells that is available from the ATCC.

Protocol steps with step annotations:

Day 1: Cell Plating

Culture the cells in the T-75 flasks (set 2 flasks for each cell line, one for assay, the other as back up and passaging), with 10 ml maintenance media per flask, until they are 70–90% confluent, changing the media every 2–3 days depending on cell density.

Pre-warm the assay media and TrypLE to 22 – 37°C.

In the biological safety cabinet, gently remove the media from the cells in the T-75 flasks and rinse (gently) the cells twice with 5–10 ml DPBS/flask.

Immediately after removing the second DPBS rinse, coat the cells with 2 ml TrypLE per flask.

Replace the lids on the flasks and return the cells to the incubator (37°C, 5% CO2 ) for 5–10 minutes.

NOTE: Do not leave cells in TrypLE for more than 15 minutes, to avoid over-digesting the cell membrane proteins.

After the 5–10 min incubation period, add 4 ml assay media to each flask and mix so that the serum (FBS) in the media inactivates the TrypLE. Use the resuspension to rinse any remaining cells off the bottom surface of the flask, then stand the flask up on its end (opposite the cap) to pool the resuspension over a smaller surface area.

Mix the cells (gently and carefully; avoid making bubbles) 10 times with a serological pipette.

NOTE: At this point, if detaching multiple flasks of a single cell type, cells of the same type may be pooled together into a single resuspension volume.

Remove 11 μl of cell resuspension into a 2.0-ml microcentrifuge tube for counting.

Add 11 μl of trypan blue to the cell sample and gently mix with pipetting 3 times.

Transfer 10 μl of dyed sample into each chamber on the cell counting slide, load the slide into the cell counter, and read the cell count and viability. Make sure the viability of the cells to be used for the assay is &gt;90%.

In a 50 ml conical tube, prepare 35 ml of cell solution for plating one 384-well plate (prepare 20 ml more for each additional cell plate if needed), at the concentration needed to achieve the desired number of cells per well. Plating volume for the 384-well plate is at 45 μl/well; HMC3 cells are prepared at 13,333 cells/ml to yield 600 cells/45 μl/well, and BV2 cells at 8,889 cells/ml to yield 400 cells/45 μl/well, and mouse primary microglia at 44,444 cells/ml to yield 2000 cells/45 μl/well. Each 384-well plate can test 16 different treatments in duplicates in 10 point concentration serial dilutions, plating number of plates for an experiment accordingly.

Prepare the following in separate 50 ml conical tubes for washing tubes of the 384 Multidrop (or similar instrument can be used for plating cells into 384-well plates): &gt; 30 ml sterile MilliQ water

25 ml serum-free media

NOTE: volume needed for plating 2 cell lines; add 10 ml per additional cell line.

15–20 mL 70% ethanol

Prepare the Multidrop and set it to dispense 45 μl/well into all the wells of a 384-well plate.

Label an empty clear-bottomed 384-well plate and set it on the plate carrier of the Multidrop. Remove the lid and set it aside.

Run ~10 ml of serum-free media through the instrument into a waste container.

Draw up some air into the tubing, then gently mix the first 50 ml conical tube of cells for plating. Draw up the cell suspension into the instrument. Gently agitate the cell suspension constantly, until plating is completed.

NOTE: Ensure that no air bubbles are being drawn up. Be sure to have at least 22.5 ml of cell suspension in the 50 ml tube for plating a 384-well plate with 45ul/well.

Initiate the cell plating program to plate the cells.

If plating multiple plates of the same cell type, be sure to add more cell suspension to the 50-ml conical tube, then repeat the plating.

Check the plate visually for any obvious volume errors, which can be corrected manually.

When the plating step is completed, empty the tubes of residual cell suspension.

Prepare tubes for plating the next cell line by sequentially running 20 ml of sterile MilliQ water followed by 10 ml of serum-free media through the tubes, then hold the tubes up in the air and draw up some air.

Repeat steps 16–19 with the second cell line.

Check the plates under a microscope to ensure that the cells were plated evenly and with no visible contamination.

Clean tubes by sequentially by running 30 ml sterile MilliQ water through the instrument followed by 10 ml of 70% ethanol until all the ethanol has run through into the waste container.

Power off the instrument. Clean and store the instrument and accessories.

Incubate plated cells for overnight to 24 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2 before treatment.

Day 2: Compound serial dilution and treating cells

NOTE: The following procedures are for a single plate of each cell type, with duplicates of each compound dilution series within each plate.

NOTE: Protocols for the OT-2 (or other similar liquid handling) robot (compound dilution protocol and compound distribution protocol) will need to be designed and tested before proceeding. Multichannel pipettes in the robot are oriented along the Y (e.g., plate column) axis using the protocols.

Use a 96-well compound plate for serial dilution. Start by manually filling column 2 wells with 97 μl of the assay media, then add 3 μl of 20 mM compound in DMSO in each well to get 600 μM and 3% DMSO of each compound as 10x.

Make 3% DMSO in assay media (30 μl DMSO and 970 μl media/ml), prepare 6 ml for each compound plate, add the 3% DMSO-media at 60 μl/well to wells in column 3–12.

Prepare a 1:3 dilution series by sequential transferring/mixing (3 times) 30 μl from each well to the next well across the rows, from column 2 to column 11. Column 12 will remain without compound, as the vehicle control column. An example plate map of compound dilution is shown in Figure 1A.

Transfer and position the compound plates, cell plates, and a box of 20 μl tips securely in the proper positions within the robot enclosure, according to the protocol setup on the robot app/software. Remove any lids or covers from these items.

Use the 8-channel pipette to pick up 20 μl control DMSO-media from column 12, and transfer it to columns 1, 12, 23, and 24 in each cell plate, distributing 5 μl/well, do twice per column since it is a 96-well to 384-well transfer. Change tips after this step.

Pick up 10 μl compounds from column 2 of the compound plate, transfer to column 2 of a 384-well cell plate through 2 duplicate actions (5 μl/well, 2 distributions/column); repeat these actions (pick up and transfer) through column 3–11 to treat the left half of the 384-well cell plate.

Repeat step-5 with a new set of tips and the second compound plate to treat the right half (column 13–22) of the 384-well cell plate.

Return cell plates to the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 hours before next step.

An example map of treated cell plate is shown in Figure 1B.

NOTE: The above compound distribution procedures are performed with the OT-2 automatic pipetting robot; These steps can be done with similar instruments. The compound distribution protocol requires the 20 μl 8-channel pipette to transfer 5 μl of each concentration of each compound from the 96-well compound plate to the corresponding wells in the 384-well cell plates, changing tips for each compound plate.

Day 3: pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris seeding

NOTE: The pHrodo-myelin/cell debris seeding protocol uses the 20 μl 8-channel pipette to transfer 5 μl of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris from the compound plate to the corresponding wells in the cell plates so that final cell exposure to 5 μg/ml that was experimentally determined (Figure 1C), changing tips after every transfer (from the compound plate to the cell plate) to avoid potential cross-contamination of compounds into the pHrodo-myelin/cell debris in the compound plate. The following protocol is for two cell plates; adjust volumes accordingly if using additional plates.

Pre-warm 5 ml of cell culture media to 37 C.

For each cell plate, thaw 2 aliquots of pHrodo-labeled myelin/cell debris (ea. 55 μl at 1 mg/ml) in the water bath at room temperature.

Vortex the aliquots briefly, then sonicate them in the sonicating water bath for two minutes, vortex the aliquots again, and transfer them into the biosafety cabinet.

In the biosafety cabinet, dilute each pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris aliquot with 1.1 ml assay media (yielding 50 μg/ml pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris), pool the four aliquot dilutions in a 15-ml conical tube, and mix thoroughly.

Distribute 260 μl/well of diluted pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris to wells in the first two columns (one column per cell plate) of a clean compound plate for seeding cells with the OT-2.

Use 20 μl tips to transfer 5 μl/well of the pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris from the compound plate to two 384-well cell plates; seed control columns 12 and 23 first, changing tips after every seeding to avoid cross contamination among wells when seeding wells in columns 2–11 and 13–22. Total seeded wells cover columns 2–23 of a 384-well cell plate; leave wells in columns 1 and 24 without seeding as negative controls.

Return cell plates to the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 20 hours before next step.

Day 4: Nuclear Staining and Imaging

NOTE: The following protocol is for two cell plates; adjust volumes accordingly if using additional plates.

A. Nuclear Staining

Pre-warm 22 ml of assay media to room temperature.

Add 22 μl of 10mg/ml Hoechst 33342 into 22 ml assay media; mix well.

Use 200 μl tips to transfer 20 μl/well of the diluted Hoechst 33342 to 384-well cell plates, final cell exposure to 2.6 μg/ml Hoechst 33342; return cell plates into incubator of 37°C with 5% CO2 for incubation.

NOTE: This step is performed with the OT-2 automatic pipetting robot but can be done with similar instruments.

After 30 minutes incubation, remove cell plates from the incubator for imaging.

B. Imaging

Power on the ArrayScan XTI high-content imaging instrument, start Thermo Scientific HCS Studio Cell Analysis Software, choose the template of General Spot Measurement Tool. Set two channels, channel-1 for nuclear fluorescence (Hoechst 33342, ex.386nm em.440nm) and channel-2 for phagocytosis vesicle fluorescence (pHrodo red, ex. 560 nm em.&gt;585 nm).

NOTE: The plate imaging alignment may need to be optimized on the instrument at this time if not properly centered on wells.

Load the plate and optimize the imaging settings using the 10x objective, adjust appropriate imaging settings for each cell type to be imaged including automatic focusing on nucleus, find optimal exposure time for each channel, set the software to take a z-stack of 3 images with 6.7 μm apart to generate a projected image for analysis and taking 4 images/well.

Take example images from Max and Min wells and analyze these images through image analysis process: 1) segment cells on nucleus to identify individual cells; 2) expand identified edge of nucleus 30–50 μm to cover whole cell area; 3) identify phagocytosis vesicles in cell area for analysis.

Start the imaging, collecting four images per well. For analysis, collect cell counts per well, average nuclear intensity, and mean total phagocytosis spot intensity/cell, plus any other additional parameters of interest, for quantitation.

NOTE: In the ArrayScan system, choose the template of “General Spot Measurement Tool” that allows to identify and analyze both the nuclei and the phagocytosed vesicles. A separate analysis protocol is needed for each cell type since different cell sizes and morphology need to be optimized for each specific cell type before starting the automated analysis. The imaging and analysis can be done with other high content imaging systems using the similar analysis method.

Support protocol title: Procedures to isolate myelin/membrane debris from mouse brain and label with pHrodo

Introduction

When developing the phagocytosis assay, we questioned what would be a proper ligand for measuring microglial phagocytosis. There are many options from which to choose, such as commercially available recombinant Aβ, Tau, microbeads, zymosan, and bacteria, or experimentally isolated dead neurons, synaptosomes or myelin from mouse brains. Since our project targets the TREM2 pathway, and since myelin/membrane debris has been shown to be a good ligand for TREM2 binding (Andreone et al., 2020; Ennerfelt et al., 2022; Nugent et al., 2020) and a natural material in the brain that is cleaned up by microglia in both homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases, we decided to use myelin/membrane debris for the microglial phagocytosis/cell health assay. Isolation of crude myelin/membrane debris from 6–8-week old wild type C57BL/6J mouse brains was followed and modified on established literature protocols using sucrose gradients (0.32 M/0.85 M) and ultracentrifugation (Andreone et al., 2020; Erwig et al., 2019). The crude myelin/membrane debris was diluted to 1mg/ml (protein equivalent) in DPBS, stored in a −80°C freezer, and subsequently labeled with pHrodo red dye.

Protocol steps with step annotations:

Anesthetize 6–8 week old C57BL/6J mice (do up to 3 mice for each prep) with 1.25% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol through ip injection of 20ul/gram body weight, then euthanize by cervical dislocation. (All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Indiana University).

Remove brain tissues and place in 1.2 ml/brain of cold lysis buffer in a glass petri dish on ice, cut into fine pieces with a razor blade and then dissociate via dounce homogenization (20x loose, then 20x tight).

Transfer the homogenate to 5 ml ultracentrifuge tubes with 1.2 ml/tube, weigh loaded tubes to have balanced pairs for ultracentrifugation.

Add 1.2ml of 0.32 M sucrose carefully underneath with a sterilized pasteur pipette, and then add 1.2 ml of 0.85 M sucrose underneath both layers.

Precool the ultracentrifuge to 4 °C, load samples, and spin at 75,000g at 4 °C for 30 min (in an SW 40 Ti rotor in an Optima XPN-80 ultracentrifuge, Beckman, or similar) with low acceleration and deceleration.

Transfer the myelin/membrane debris to 2 ml microtubes with 1.2 ml/tube.

Spin at 14000g at 4°C with maximum acceleration and deceleration for 10 min, discard supernatant, resuspend pellets by in 1.2 ml cold distilled water for each tube and vortex, repeat above steps 3 more times; after final centrifugation step, resuspend myelin/membrane debris with PBS at 1ml/tube.

Combine myelin from the 2 ml tubes into one 15 ml tube on ice for sonication at max amplitude for 15 seconds, do 3 times.

Do BCA assay to determine protein concentration, then dilute with DPBS to 1 mg/ml protein concentration, make 5ml/tube aliquots (using 15ml tubes) store in −20°C or −80°C freezer, or process for pHrodo labeling immediately through the following procedures.

Prepare a 10 mM solution of amine reactive pHrodo red (1 mg/vial): warm the reagent vial to room temperature and spin the vial briefly with a microcentrifuge before opening it; add 150 μl anhydrous DMSO to the vial, vortex and mix with pipetting to ensure that the dye is well dissolved.

Prepare 1M NaHCO3 (MW 84.01) with dissolve 168 mg in 2 ml Sterile MilliQ water (can be premade and stored in −20°C).

Transfer 15 ml thawed 1 mg/ml myelin/membrane debris into a 50 ml conical tube.

Add 1.65 ml 1M NaHCO3 to the 15 ml myelin/membrane debris. Mix by pipetting.

Add the 150 μl 10 mM pHrodo red in DMSO to the myelin/membrane debris in the 50 ml conical tube. Mix by pipetting.

React for 45 min at room temperature: wrap the 50 ml tube with aluminum foil and set the tube in a rack on a shaker with gentle shaking.

Remove unbound dye: transfer labeled myelin/membrane debris from the 50 ml tube to about 10–12 2 ml centrifuge tubes with 1.5 ml/vial (weigh tubes for balance before centrifuging); spin at 14000g for 10 min at 4°C, discard supernatant, resuspend labeled myelin/membrane debris in cold DPBS (keep on ice) by vortex; repeat above 3 more times to remove unbound pHrodo red dye.

Resuspend the labeled myelin/membrane debris in cold DPBS to total 15 ml (same as original volume of the unlabeled myelin, to keep the concentration at about 1 mg/ml); pool in a 50 ml conical tube on ice.

Sonicate the labeled myelin/membrane debris solution on ice (put the sonicator probe into the myelin solution in the 50 ml tube kept on ice in a beaker) at max strength for 15 seconds; do 3 times.

Make aliquots of 55 μl/vial in 2 ml vials (two aliquots are required for each 384-well plate for one assay); store at −20°C (good for 3 months) or −80°C (good for a year) or use immediately. The final molar ratio of pHrodo red/myelin is at least 2 (counting myelin basal protein MW 20 KD as the average MW of the sample).

Check the quality of the pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris prep with a fluorescent microscope as follows:Prepare pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris at 5 μg/ml in DPBS (1:200 dilution of 1 mg/ml stock with DPBS).

Transfer 100 μl of the prep to a well of a 96-well clear-bottom cell culture plate.

Image with a fluorescent microscope using a 20× lens to get both transmitted light and fluorescent (ex. 560, em. 585 nm) images. When in DPBS (about pH 7), the sample should show little or no fluorescence.

Add 200 μl of a pH 4 buffer to the well and repeat step c.

The pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris should show strong red fluorescence in acid solution (around pH 4.2) (Figure 2A and 2B).

Check pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris signal in phagocytosis as follows:Plate cells in a clear-bottomed microplate (1,000 cells/45 μl/well for a 384 well plate, or 5,000 cells/90 μl/well for a 96-well plate).

Incubate overnight in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

On day 2, prepare a 1:20 dilution (as 10× for seeding to cells) of the 1 mg/ml pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris (e.g., 5 μl mixed with 95 μl medium),

Add the diluted pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris into the cell plate (e.g., 5 μl/well for a 384-well plate with 45 μl cells/well plated, or 10 μl/well for a 96-well plate with 90 μl cells/well plated) so that cells are exposed to 5 μg/ml pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris.

Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 4–5 hr.

Check phagocytosis with a fluorescent microscope as above in step 19 (Figure 2C and 2D).

Using 5 μg/ml pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris for the assay was determined with concentration dependent phagocytosis on both HMC3 and BV2 cells (Figure 1C).

COMMENTARY:

Background Information:

Microglial phagocytosis has been studied for its role in brain development (Cunningham, Martinez-Cerdeno, &amp; Noctor, 2013; Matcovitch-Natan et al., 2016; Wake et al., 2013) and maintenance of homeostasis through surveillance and cleaning of cell debris, including dead cells and abnormal protein aggregates (Li &amp; Barres, 2018; Mundt et al., 2022; Nimmerjahn et al., 2005; Salter &amp; Stevens, 2017; Streit, Mrak, &amp; Griffin, 2004). Drug discovery targeting microglial phagocytosis function has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases (Nizami et al., 2019; Salter &amp; Stevens, 2017). A reliable cellular assay capable of measuring drug-regulated phagocytosis activity while distinguishing that activity from phagocytosis modulation caused by cell stress is needed for drug discovery research targeting microglial phagocytosis. This need motivated us to develop and establish a high content microglial phagocytosis/cell health assay to meet the challenge.

The primary advantage of the assay is the capability to measure phagocytosis and cell health simultaneously, allowing for the discernment of drug efficacy on phagocytosis (either stimulation or inhibition) in the absence of cell stress, since microglia under stress can show either higher or lower phagocytosis than that of resting microglia, as we have repeatedly observed. The multiplex feature of the assay has advantages over assays utilizing flow cytometry or imaging techniques to measure only phagocytosis alone. In addition, the assay with 384-well plates has the capacity required for screening or supporting molecule structure-activity-relationship studies for drug discovery projects. Another distinguishing feature of the assay is that it does not have any washing step but is a mix-and-read assay. Using pHrodo (an acid-activated fluorophore) -labeled myelin/membrane debris is the key to avoid any washing step for measuring cellular phagocytosis in the assay. Only live cells have bright phagocytosis vesicles with well-maintained inner acidic pH, and these are easily distinguished from extracellular pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris which shows negligible or low signal in a neutral pH environment. The washing-free protocol makes the cell count/well a reliable measurement for the evaluation of cell proliferation and viability under drug treatments (&gt;24 hours), which combined with the measurement of nuclear intensity allowed estimation of treatment induced apoptosis. We think that combined measurements of cell count and nuclear intensity allow estimating overall status of cell population under experimental treatments, named them cell health measurements. One of the limitations of the 384-well plate assay is that it requires the use of an automatic pipetting instrument for liquid additions since it is difficult to keep uniformity of 384-well plates with manual operations. However, the assay can be performed with 96-well or other cell plates, through manual operations, to meet individual research needs. Another limitation is the necessity of an automatic high content imaging system to handle the large numbers of images and analyses. The assay can be done manually as well if not used for drug discovery screening projects, by imaging with a common fluorescent microscope and performing image analysis with a proper software.

Critical Parameters:

Cells---

It is critical to check the cell viabilities when starting the assay. When plating cells, we check to ensure that viability is always &gt;90%. Plating densities need to be experimentally determined and kept consistent to make the assay reproducible. The assay media contains HEPES to maintain pH since during imaging the cell plates will be out of the incubator and exposed to room temperature and environmental air. We established this assay with microglial cell lines, HMC3 (immortalized human microglia) and BV2 (immortalized mouse microglia), and we have also used it with mouse primary microglia. The protocol can be used for other cells as well, such as macrophages and iPSC-derived microglia, to measure phagocytosis and cell heath simultaneously.

Ligands---

The pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris was chosen as the ligand for our studies targeting TREM2 pathway because TREM2 has been shown to bind membrane lipids, especially the phosphatidylserine (PS) of dead cells. The protocol can be used to study the phagocytosis of other ligands such as synaptosomes, zymosan, bacteria, protein aggregates (Aβ, Tau), and microbeads, to suit individual research purposes. The seeding concentration and incubation time need to be experimentally established and kept consistent for reproducibility. Choice of 20–24 hours as the pHrodo-myelin incubation time was based on our observation that maximal phagocytosis took 4 hours and remained maximal for 24 hours, so that maximal phagocytosis can be measured. For experiments aiming to measure the initial phase of phagocytosis, the time course of phagocytosis needs to be experimentally determined.

Imaging---

Collecting well-focused images is critical for quantitative high content analysis since out-of-focus images always lead to inaccurate quantitative measurements. We set up automatic imaging using 3 focus planes separated by 6.7 μm along the Z-axis for every field, then save a single projected image formed from those 3 images for analysis. This is critical to ensure quality of the quantitative imaging analysis for subcellular measurements.

Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting steps are presented in Table 1.

Data Analysis:

All collected raw data are normalized to the untreated control with following formula: % of control=100 × (X-Min)/(Max-Min). Factors in the formula are that X is a raw data from a treated well, Max is an average measurement from pHrodo-myelin seeded but untreated wells, and Min is an average measurement from no pHrodo-myelin untreated wells. Normalized data are used for curve fitting that is done with the variable slope (four parameters) using the Prism software.

Understanding Results:

The 384-well plate assay design is shown in Figure 3. Each plate contains two Min (negative) control columns (columns 1 &amp; 24, without pHrodo-myelin seeding) and two Max (positive) (Figure-3A) control columns (columns 12 &amp; 23, with pHrodo-myelin) (Figure-3B) so that these controls come from edge and middle wells, respectively. The rest of the wells are used for testing compounds in 10-point concentration response, in duplicates for each compound; a total of 16 compounds can be tested in one plate.

To ensure that the measurements reflect the steady state of compound treatment effects and cell health, the assay was set with a total compound treatment time of 48 hours, including pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris seeding performed 20–24 hours after compound addition. Figure 4 shows the image analysis process to identify individual cells and phagocytosis vesicles. Among many available quantitative measurements from the image analysis, we selected three parameters for the assay:

1) The mean total intensity of phagocytosis vesicles/cell --- to measure phagocytosis. There are multiple parameters generated from the image analysis, including phagocytosis vesicle area, number, and various fluorescence intensity measurements. Comparing these parameters, the total fluorescence intensity of vesicles/cell is the most sensitive one and was chosen for quantifying phagocytosis.

2) The total cell counts --- to measure overall cell viability, which is affected by proliferation and cell death. We chose to take 4 images/well (with the 10x objective lens) that cover about 50% of the total area of a well in a 384-well plate to represent cell count of the well.

3) The average nuclear intensity--- to measure drug-induced apoptosis, with high signal indicating nuclear condescension (a sign of early apoptosis) and low signal indicating DNA degradation (a sign of later apoptosis, when activated caspases digest DNA).

When evaluating the effects of a treatment, the combination of the three measurements allows for the determination of treatment effects on phagocytosis and of treatment caused cytotoxicity. We tested Cytochalasin D in the assay, for its known effect of blocking actin filament formation (Casella, Flanagan, &amp; Lin, 1981), thus inhibiting phagocytosis and other actin-mediated cell activities (Meena et al., 2021; Melzer, von der Ohe, &amp; Hass, 2019; Murai, Seki, Sakurada, Usui, &amp; Masuda, 1993; Tilney &amp; Portnoy, 1989; Vance et al., 2016). We observed that 24-hour Cytochalasin D treatment (Figure 5B) inhibited HMC3 cell phagocytosis with IC50= 138 nM, with lower potencies for its effects on cell count (IC50=367 nM) and nuclear intensity (EC50=488 nM). These results indicated that Cytochalasin D inhibited phagocytosis in HMC3 cells, with cytotoxicity effects indicated by a cell number decrease and a concurrent nuclear intensity increase. It has been shown that Cytochalasin D inhibits cell division at the end of the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and causes cells to round up (Margadant, Cremers, Sonnenberg, &amp; Boonstra, 2013); which can explain our observation of decreased cell counts and increased nuclear intensity in HMC3 cells. When testing LPS on the HMC3 and BV2 microglia, results showed that HMC3 cells did not respond to LPS (Figure 6A), while BV2 cells showed stimulation of phagocytosis parallel with decreased cell count, both in concentration-dependent responses, and no nuclear intensity changes up to 10 μg/ml LPS (Figure 6B). The experiment was performed at least 2 times. These experimental results validated the assay performance. Observations that HMC3 cells failed to respond to the LPS suggested that HMC3 cells at basal status might lack TLR4 or related signaling molecules since LPS is known to bind to TLR4, thus stimulating immune cells. Different responses from different cell lines are not uncommon, and the mechanisms behind these differences remain to be studied.

To explore cellular signaling regulation of phagocytosis with the assay, we chose a highly selective human PI3Kd inhibitor, Idelalisib (Somoza et al., 2015), as a reference compound, based on knowledge that PI3K regulates cellular phagocytosis (Desale &amp; Chinnathambi, 2021; Gillooly, Simonsen, &amp; Stenmark, 2001). Idelalisib (48-hour treatment) inhibited HMC3 cell phagocytosis in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 around 500 nM, with no significant cell count decrease or nuclear intensity changes (Figure 7A). In comparison, Idelalisib did not inhibit phagocytosis in BV2 cells, but increased phagocytosis in parallel with decreasing cell counts and increasing nuclear intensity, suggesting that the stimulation of phagocytosis was related to cell stress (Figure 7B). These results were very reproducible, with similar results observed in more than 30 repeated assays, or a 100% success rate.

Saracatinib (AZD0530), an inhibitor of the Src/abl family of tyrosine-kinase including Fyn and Lyn, has been repurposed for potential AD therapy and has been in clinical trials (Nygaard, 2018; Nygaard et al., 2015; van Dyck et al., 2019) since some Src kinases have been found to be involved in AD pathogenesis (Dhawan &amp; Combs, 2012). When testing Saracatinib in our assay, we observed that it was highly active in stimulating HMC3 cell phagocytosis in the concentration range without cytotoxicity, EC50&lt;200nM (Figure 8A and images). In comparison, BV2 cells responded to Saracatinib differently, with no stimulated phagocytosis in the sub-μM concentration range, and when concentrations &gt; 1 μM showing cell count decreases and biphasic nuclear intensity changes (first increased then decreased), which indicate nuclear condensation followed by DNA degradation (Figure 8B and images). Together, these results suggest that the phagocytosis increases under the Saracatinib treatment as a stress reaction in BV2 cells. Similar results were observed in two repeat experiments. The mechanisms behind the different responses from the two microglial cell lines to Saracatinib may be from possible differ in target structures in human vs. mouse and remain to be studied. The observation that Saracatinib significantly stimulates phagocytosis in HMC3 cells is interesting and may constitute an additional mechanism contributing to the therapeutic efficacy of the drug for AD.

Based on the results of testing Idelalisib (inhibition effect) and Saracatinib (stimulation effect), we showed that microglial phagocytosis of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris can be regulated by small molecule drugs; therefore, this assay can serve as a good in vitro model for drug discovery of small molecules targeting specific cellular signaling pathways with the aim to regulate the phagocytosis. We suggest that Idelalisib and Saracatinib can be used as references for the phagocytosis assay on microglia such as HMC3 cells. The assay was applied for the characterization of chemical probes targeting microglia, with results contributing to two papers (Potjewyd et al., 2022a, 2022b). Currently, the assay is being used in our AD drug discovery projects targeting the TREM2 pathway of microglia, specifically for the selection of INPP5D inhibitors and PLCG2 activators respectively. In conclusion, the microglial phagocytosis and cell health high content assay provides a high-capacity tool measuring regulation of phagocytosis and cell health simultaneously, which can be helpful for drug discovery studies targeting the microglial phagocytosis.

Figure1. Plate maps of compound serial dilution and treated cell plate.

Compound serial dilutions are performed in 96-well compound plates for treating cells in the 384-wellcell plate. Two 96-well plates will be used for compound dilutions to cover one 384-well cell plates for testing 16 compounds in duplicates. An example plate map of compound dilution is shown in (A) and a treated cell plate map shown in (B). (C) pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris concentration-dependent phagocytosis was tested in both HMC3 and BV2 cells through 4-hr exposures. Both cells showed a concentration-dependent phagocytosis signal; 5μg/ml (&gt;50% of maximal signal) was chosen for the assay.

Figure 2. Characterization of pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris.

The pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris was checked in PBS for fluorescence and on cells for phagocytosis. Overlayed transmitted light and fluorescent images are shown. A. in pH6.94 PBS with no red fluorescence; B. in pH4.28 PBS with strong red fluorescence. C. HMC3 cells with red phagocytosis vesicles. D. BV2 cells with red phagocytosis vesicles. Scale bar: 100 μm.

Figure 3. Example images from a 384-well assay plate.

The plate image (montage of a 384-well assay plate) shows the experimental design; 2 columns of Max control wells with pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris seeding (A), 2 columns of Min of unseeded wells (B); and 16 duplicate rows for testing compounds in 10-point concentration response. Two zoomed in images are examples from a Max well (A) and a Min well (B) showing with phagocytosis vesicles (red) and nuclei (blue).

Figure 4. Image analysis of the phagocytosis/cell health assay.

Example images are from HMC3 and BV2 cells with (Max, 5 μg/ml) and without (Min, 0 μg/ml) pHrodo-myelin/membrane debris seeding. Original images were segmented by 3 steps, 1) identify individual nucleus shown by a blue line on nuclear edge; 2) expand the nuclear edge to cover cell area shown by green lines around each cell; 3) identify and mask phagocytosis vesicles (masking shown in yellow) in cell area. Arrows show the transformation of original images to segmented and masked images used for quantitative measurements. (Red—phagocytosis spots; Blue—nuclei; Green—ROI of single cells; Yellow—masking for phagocytosis spots)

Figure 5. Cytochalasin D inhibited microglial phagocytosis.

HMC3 cell phagocytosis was inhibited by cytochalasin D (IC50=138 nM) in the assay; its cytotoxicity was reflected by the inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50=367 nM) and parallel increase of nuclear intensity (EC50=488 nM).

Figure 6. LPS stimulating phagocytosis of BV2 but not HMC3 cells.

Cells were treated with serially diluted LPS for 48 hr. (A) HMC3 cells did not respond to LPS treatment, as shown by all three measurements. (B) BV2 cells showed a concentration-dependent stimulation of phagocytosis (EC50=255 ng/ml), an inhibition of cell count (IC50=122 ng/ml), and no changes in nuclear intensity.

Figure 7. PI3Kd inhibitor (Idelalisib) regulation of microglial phagocytosis.

A. Idelalisib (48 hours treatment) inhibited phagocytosis in HMC3 cells (IC50=526 nM), while not affecting cell count or nuclear intensity. Results indicated that Idelalisib specifically inhibited HMC3 phagocytosis. B. BV2 cells showed a concentration-dependent cell count decrease (IC50=22 μM), nuclear intensity increase (EC50=4.14 μM), and parallel stimulation of phagocytosis (EC50&gt;60 μM, the maximal dose in the assay), indicating that the Idelalisib stimulated phagocytosis of BV2 cells was cell stress related rather than specific activity.

Figure 8. Src inhibitor (Saracatinib) regulation of microglial phagocytosis.

A. Saracatinib (48 hours treatment) stimulated HMC3 cell phagocytosis (EC50=182 nM), with minimal effects on cell count and nuclear intensity until concentrations &gt;10 μM showing cytotoxicity. Results indicated that Saracatinib specifically stimulated HMC3 phagocytosis. Example images selected from 3 dose points showed cells at normal state (A1, healthy cells), at stimulated phagocytosis state (A2, healthy cells) and cells with nuclear condensation and no phagocytosis (A3, unhealthy cells in apoptosis, marked by arrows) B. BV2 cells showed a dose dependent cell count decrease (IC50=833 nM) and parallel nuclear intensity changes (increase then decrease), as well as increased phagocytosis (EC50=266 nM). Selected images showed healthy normal cells (B1), cells under stress with increased phagocytosis (B2) and dead cells with low nuclear intensity since DNA degradation (B3, marked by arrows). Blue-- nuclei; Red—phagocytosis vesicles.
