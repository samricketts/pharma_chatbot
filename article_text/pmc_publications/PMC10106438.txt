Background:

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) as measured by cortical atrophy and white matter hyperintensities [leukoaraiosis], captured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are increasing in prevalence due to the growth of the aging population and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors in the population. CSVD impacts cognitive function and mobility, but it is unclear if it affects complex, functional activities like driving.

Methods:

In a cohort of 163 cognitively normal, community-dwelling older adults (age ≥ 65), we compared naturalistic driving behavior with mild/moderate leukoaraiosis, cortical atrophy, or their combined rating in a clinical composite termed, aging-related changes to those without any over a two-and-a-half-year period.

Results:

Older drivers with mild or moderate cortical atrophy and aging-related changes (composite) experienced a greater decrease in the number of monthly trips which was due to a decrease in the number of trips made within a one-to-five-mile diameter from their residence. Older drivers with CSVD experience a larger reduction in daily driving behaviors than drivers without CSVD, which may serve as an early neurobehavioral marker for functional decline.

Conclusions:

As CSVD markers, leukoaraiosis and cortical atrophy are standard MRI metrics that are widely available and can be used for screening individuals at higher risk for driving safety risk and decline in community mobility.

pmc1. Introduction

In 2018, there were more than 45 million licensed drivers aged 65 and older in the United States (US)1. This number is expected to progressively increase with the aging of the baby boomers, individuals born between 1946–1964. By 2040, the number of older adults is expected to reach 80.8 million; by 2060, it will reach 94.7 million, constituting nearly 25% of the US population2. The growth of the population of older drivers will inevitably be accompanied by increased crash rates and associated injury and mortality among this age group. In 2019, approximately 8,000 older adults were killed in traffic crashes, and more than 250,000 were treated in emergency departments for crash-related injuries3. Numerous factors contribute to a higher risk of collision, and age-related changes in the brain may play a role in driving impairment and comorbid conditions. Normative age-related decline in visual acuity, motor and sensory abilities, and executive functioning are fundamental skills4–6 that directly impact driving operational skills (e.g. vehicle signaling7, steering, stability) are critical for safety for older adults. Assessing common medical conditions such as vascular disorders and their end organ manifestations may provide further insight into whether a decline in driving behavior is accelerated for older adults.

Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is an umbrella term for pathologies impacting arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries8. Prevalence increases with age, affecting about 5% of adults at 50 years of age to almost 100% of adults 90 years or older and contributes to the high global disease burden of stroke and vascular dementia9. CSVD is a classification associated with cognitive impairment, depression, gait disturbances, and dementia8. Neuroimaging features of CSVD include leukoaraiosis or white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cortical atrophy, small subcortical infarcts and lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier10. Leukoaraiosis is an ischemic lesion mainly produced by atherosclerotic changes of small blood vessels in cerebral white matter, predominantly in the periventricular area7. Leukoaraiosis is frequently reported in individuals at high cardiovascular risk, that increases with age11 and may lead to a decline in cognitive function, processing speed, and attention, which are crucial abilities required for complex activities8.

While there is limited literature on the role of CSVD on functional decline, a recent systematic review12 found studies showing a relationship between driving safety and CSVD. Greater WMH was associated with a faster change from currently driving to driving cessation over time in older adults with increased WMH severity. While the direct effect of brain atrophy on driving has not been studied, data suggests that the reduction of gray matter was related to riskier driving behaviors in older adults10. It has also been shown that CSVD conditions such as brain atrophy and leukoaraiosis highly correlate with the degradation of driving safety performance in the elderly on a closed-circuit course8. Reduced brain volume and greater WMH were associated with poorer simulated driving performance and greater dependence on transportation in older drivers with heart failure13. Additionally, greater WMH can predict a higher burden of age related brain atrophy14. These studies suggest that different types of CSVD manifest and contribute to decline and poorer driving performance in older adults.

Various driving studies examined the influence of CSVD by using controlled conditions (road tests, driving simulators) or self-report12. However, no study to date has investigated the impact of CSVD on everyday driving data captured using sensors and global positioning systems (GPS) among older adults. The purpose of this study was to assess whether CSVD (leukoaraiosis and cortical atrophy), as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was related to longitudinal changes in naturalistic driving behavior among older adults.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Participants

Participants were enrolled in longitudinal aging and driving studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University in St. Louis. Participants included in this study were at least 65 years of age or older, had a clinical dementia rating (CDR®)15 of 0 at baseline, and did not progress upon follow-up assessment during this study. Additionally, participants had their brain MRI completed within two years of enrollment in the longitudinal driving study. Participants had to self-report driving at least once per week and have self-report driving data available within one year at the start of their naturalistic driving data collection. All data analyzed were collected prior to 3/31/2020 to exclude the effects of pandemic guidelines (e.g., lockdown, restrictions, shelter-in-place) on driving behavior16. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB # 201208161 and 201706043) of Washington University in Saint Louis, and all participants provided signed informed consent.

2.2 Cognitive and cardiovascular outcomes

Participants completed a comprehensive battery of clinical and cognitive assessments annually. We examined four key neuropsychological assessments: Animal Naming17 to assess semantic fluency, the free recall test from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding18 test to measure episodic memory, Trail Making Test Parts A and B19 to assess attention and processing speed. Each cognitive test was z-scored to the baseline cognitive assessment and averaged to form a composite z-score. We also examined common cardiovascular conditions at annual visits, including myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, angina, hypercholesterolemia, congestive health failure, pacemaker implant, heart valve replacement, and angioplasty. If a participant ever had a condition or still had the condition, it was endorsed as ever had vs. never had. A cardiovascular risk score was created ranging from zero to 10 from the clinical assessment. The closest available cognitive and cardiovascular data to the installation of the datalogger were selected for analysis.

2.3 Naturalistic driving and self-report outcomes

A datalogger (Azuga G2 Tracking device) was plugged into each participant’s vehicle’s onboard diagnostic port (OBDII). Driving behavior was continuously collected for a given “trip,” defined as ignition start to ignition off with a minimum of 100 meters travelled. This included the date, time, vehicle speed, latitude and longitude, and adverse events such as speeding, hard braking, and sudden acceleration. We have used the Driving Real-World In-Vehicle Evaluation System (DRIVES)20–22 to examine various metrics, including the total number of trips, the average distance traveled, number of night trips taken, number of trips across multiple distances from their home, overspeeding, hard braking, and sudden acceleration. Driving data were aggregated by month, and each individual’s follow-up time was truncated at 30 months (2.5 years) to eliminate the impact of extreme data values on the analysis (95th percentile of follow-up time is 27 months).

In addition to the DRIVES, participants completed the Driving Habits Questionnaire (DHQ)23 annually, which queries self-reported driving behavior over the previous year, yielding scores that reflect specific outcomes. To examine if there were group differences at baseline, we analyzed the following variables: the total number of trips taken, driving space (how far they travel from home), dependency on other drivers, number of unique destinations, and reported difficulty driving.

MRI outcomes

Brain MRI was performed on 3 Tesla using a research imaging protocol that is based upon the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)24 that includes a high-resolution T1 MPRAGE for assessment of brain structures, 2D Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) to allow for assessment of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and gradient-recalled echo T2* (GRE) to assess for the presence of blood products, including cerebral microbleeds. These elements are part of standard clinical brain MRIs. All MRIs were reviewed by board-certified neuroradiologists (JS, TB). Leukoaraiosis (white matter hyperintensities, WMH) were assessed using a score of 0–3 (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) following the Fazekas score25. Cerebral infarcts were assessed using prior published methods26. Cortical atrophy was determined by a neuroradiologist based on a standard clinical assessment that includes inspection of the cortical ribbon to determine changes in volume (e.g., shrinking gyri with a concurrent widening of the sulci) which is more discernable with gray vs. white matter tissue27. Finally, age-related changes, a common clinical impression finding for radiological reports28, is a composite variable that combined the scores for leukoaraiosis and atrophy. Details of the structural brain MRI and radiological assessment are additionally detailed in prior publications29,30.

2.4 Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses assumed a linear relationship between monthly aggregated naturalistic driving variables and CSVD markers. Based on the limited sample of participants with moderate or severe ratings, the three markers were dichotomized into normal/none and mild/moderate. A random coefficients model (linear mixed model) was used to predict the average rate of change in the driving outcomes based on the three markers groups. This model allowed y-intercepts and slopes (monthly rate of change) to vary randomly across subjects and fitted a separate regression line for each subject. The y-intercept generated from the linear mixed model estimates the mean of a driving variable at the beginning of data collection (baseline). The interaction between marker group and time was considered for testing of slope difference over time, and the model examined whether there was a difference at the y-intercept. Predicted means of the driving variables of each participant were obtained from the random coefficients model, and locally weighted scatter plot smoothing was applied to visualize the estimated y-intercept and slope change over time between groups. Data on self-reported driving, cognition, and cardiovascular conditions were obtained approximately once per year, and the baseline data closest to when the datalogger was installed was used for the generalized linear model (GLM) analysis. The linear mixed model analysis and GLM analysis adjusted for age (centered at the sample mean), education, and sex. The least squares means of the baseline driving variables were estimated from the GLM analysis. All statistical analyses were two-tailed at a significance level of 0.05 and performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

3. Results

A total of 163 participants met the study criteria and complete demographics for the cohort at their baseline visit are reported in Table 1. On average, participants were 73 years old, college educated (bachelors), a majority non-Hispanic white, and had a slightly higher proportion of women (Table 1). There were differences in age where those with mild or moderate cortical atrophy (Mean±SD: 74.11±4.63 vs. 71.16±4.17; p&lt;.0001), leukoaraiosis (73.52±4.59 vs. 71.01±4.34; p&lt;.0013), and aging-related changes (73.47±4.62 vs. 70.48±4.01; p&lt;.0004) were older compared to their respective normal group. There were no differences in the distribution of sex across the three groups.

In the longitudinal models, adults without cortical atrophy experienced a greater decline in speeding behavior (p&lt;.0001) compared to those with mild or moderate cortical atrophy (Table 2). This result was consistent when comparing the groups (none vs. mild or moderate) across leukoaraiosis (p&lt;.0001), and the combined aging-related changes (p&lt;.0001) (Figure 1). There were no group differences across CSVD groups in the y-intercepts or baseline averages for speeding behavior or adverse behaviors such as hard braking or sudden acceleration events at baseline or in the rate of change (slope).

When volume and frequency of trips were examined, there were notable differences in total trips driven per month, trips driven between one to five miles, and the number of hours driven per month. Drivers in the mild or moderate group for cortical atrophy (p=0.0028) and aging-related changes (p=0.0414) experienced a greater decline in their total monthly number of trips over time compared to those who were normal. A similar reduction in driving behavior was also found with the number of trips made within one-to-five miles from their home for those with mild or moderate cortical atrophy (p=0.0279). There were no group differences for those with or without leukoaraiosis. Additionally, adults with mild or no cortical atrophy drove significantly more hours at the start of the data collection (p=0.0227). Still, they experienced a greater decline (p=0.019) over the two-and-a-half years compared to those without cortical atrophy. There were no observable group differences for leukoaraiosis or the aging-related changes group in hours driven per month. There were no significant group differences in the total trips between five to 10 miles, or trips between 10 to 20 miles.

Based on the GLM analysis of the self-reported driving behavior at baseline, there was a difference in driving space where older adults with a mild or moderate rating of leukoaraiosis indicated having a larger driving space compared to those with none (p=0.022; least squares mean difference=0.36; 95% CI 0.05 – 0.67). There were no significant group differences in the remaining five DHQ variables across the three CSVD outcomes. There were no statistically significant group differences in the cardiovascular risk score or cognitive composite z-score between those with none and mild/moderate rating across cortical atrophy, leukoaraiosis, and aging changes.

4. Discussion

CSVD are associated with numerous adverse outcomes including cognitive impairment, mobility limitations, and functional decline in instrumental activities like driving. We examined daily driving behaviors spanning two-and-a-half years among cognitively normal older adults to determine if there were any group differences at baseline and changes over time. After adjusting for age, sex, and education, drivers with mild or moderate cortical atrophy and aging-related changes experienced a greater decrease in the total number of trips made monthly, which was directly related to the number of trips made within a one-to-five-mile diameter from their residence. When comparing the overall slopes, the corresponding normal group showed a slight increase in total monthly trips traveled over the study period. The reduction in overall driving for those with cortical atrophy and aging-related changes may be attributed to increasing neuronal loss that impacts global brain connectivity, which supports abilities that subserve daily driving.

While both groups experienced a decline in the number of mean speeding events, older drivers without cortical atrophy, leukoaraiosis and aging changes, experienced a greater decline over time compared to those classified as mild or moderate. Driving at speeds over the post-speed limit is a well-established risk factor for crashes31. A longitudinal study using naturalistic driving assessed predictors of speeding among older drivers and found that speeding decreased with older age, functional deficit, and smaller distance travelled32. The normal group across the three CSVD markers did not experience a reduction in their overall driving, nor could the difference be attributed to cognitive impairment. The reduction of this risky behavior may be attributed to a more acute awareness of normative age-related decline in motor or sensory abilities (e.g., vision, hearing, grip strength) or conscious self-regulation in response to a more complex driving environment. It is important to note that were no differences in cognitive functioning or the burden of cardiovascular diseases between the groups at baseline. Finally, crashes were rare events in our cohort and as a result, they were not examined. However, a large study of middle-aged adults (40–59 years) in the Kochi Prefecture in Japan found that self-reported crashes of any type was associated with subcortical leukoaraiosis with a higher risk for crashes occurring at crossroads when a participant had multiple or large subcortical leukoaraiosis33. The complexities of navigating an intersection requires attentional control34, reaction time35, cognitive reserve36 and functional performance of sensory and motor domains37 that may decline as a person ages. As a result, self-regulation may be a compensatory strategy used by older adults to reduce crash risk due to diminish capacity.

A recent study of Korean older adults with dementia (CDR &gt; 0) found that increasing severity of WMH (which was associated with older age) predicted faster change from currently driving to driving cessation over an average follow-up time of two-years.38 While the prior study had a large sample (n=540), driving status was based on self-reported current driving (yes vs. no) and cessation (yes vs. no). Our study observed a similar effect of age and mild or moderate staging across all three groups. There were no statistically significant differences in our sample of cognitively normal older drivers with and without leukoaraiosis/WMH in the reduction of the number of trips made. Leukoaraiosis is commonly seen in chronic diseases like stroke39 and dementia40. Park and colleagues found that a WMH-brain healthcare quotient (based on percentile rank of WMH volume) was increased for adults with greater body mass index, diabetes, and triglyceride levels—older age as a demographic variable was also associated with WMH.41 The contributions of cardiovascular risk factors to leukoaraiosis/WMH are established in the literature and may explain why there was no statistically significant differences in the driving outcomes. Our cognitive normal sample was healthy which was reflected in the overall low mean cardiovascular risk composite score but also no group differences between the composite and those with and without leukoaraiosis. However, there were observed differences in the intercepts or baseline number of monthly trips made by drivers with leukoaraiosis (M=127.74; SE=22.87) compared to those without (M=134.26; SE=22.93). While there were no significant differences in the rate of change in the slopes, both groups showed an overall decline in the number of trips made monthly.

There are several limitations to this study. Study participants were relatively healthy; as a result, there were a few with moderate and none with severe ratings across the two independent CSVD outcomes and aging-related changes combined rating. The results seemed to be largely driven by cortical atrophy compared to leukoaraiosis which resulted in aging-related changes being influence by largely cortical atrophy. As in clinic/hospital-based patient populations, participants in this study may have early Alzheimer disease, but could also have other neurodegenerative diseases, which would have different global atrophy patterns, thus a whole brain assessment is a standard approach for a neuroradiologist. While these clinical assessments can be aided by automated volumetric tools, these quantitative tools are not always available and are not considered standard of care in the United States and Europe. While the aging-related changes variable lacks a standard rating scale, it a very common impression in radiology reports for patients, thus an important link to real world clinical practice. The cardiovascular risk score has not been psychometrically tested or validated. However, a leukoaraiosis/WMH-brain healthcare quotient41 used by Park et al., may be a validated metrics to examine the relationship between CSVD and cardiovascular risk factors and conditions. Our prior studies on naturalistic driving outcomes have examined the relationship between volumetric imaging and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) among cognitively normal older adults. These studies have found that older adults with smaller normalized hippocampal volume are faster to progress to AD, and those with more abnormal levels of amyloid experience a faster decline in monthly trips taken42–44. However, measures of amyloid PET and volumetric MRI are not commonly available in clinical practice. We sought to pull elements from the MRI that are standard to a clinical exam and are typically reported – we found that these standard findings have potential real-world implications for older adult driving. MRI could be a more reliable way to identify whether an older driver is experiencing a driving decline by incorporating other patient characteristics from their history, labs, and physical examination.

5. Conclusions

Overall, the findings from this naturalistic study suggest that older drivers with cortical atrophy and leukoaraiosis compared to those without regulate their daily driving behavior at a higher rate by reducing the number of trips made over time. This reduction in driving is also associated with the number of trips made within one to five miles of their home/residence and the number of hours driven per month over time. It is unclear if this self-regulation occurs actively or subconsciously in response to increasing CSVD impairment and a complex driving environment. The mechanism surrounding self-regulation remains to be explored to understand whether it is individual awareness of their diminishing capacity to support task complexity or being told by someone. There was also a greater reduction in speeding by normal groups despite no change in their overall driving performance. It is very likely that these older drivers are becoming more aware of a decline in skills and are regulating their risk.

Highlights

There were no baseline differences across CSVD groups for adverse behaviors.

Drivers with mild/moderate cortical atrophy experienced greater decline over time.

Older adults with cortical atrophy and leukoaraiosis regulate daily driving more.
