Background

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is marked by abnormal inclusions of alpha-synuclein in oligodendrogliocytes. Etiology remains unknown. Variants in the glucocerebrosidase gene have been associated with other synucleinopathies, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease. It is unclear whether glucocerebrosidase variants are associated with MSA.

Objectives

To analyze the frequency of glucocerebrosidase gene variants among autopsy-proven cases of MSA at a brain bank in New York City.

Methods

The glucocerebrosidase gene was fully sequenced in the 17 autopsy-proven MSA cases with extractable DNA at the Columbia University New York Brain Bank from 2002 to 2016. To test if the MSA cases in the brain bank are enriched for GBA variants, we compared the GBA variant frequency in MSA to all brain bank cases with pure Alzheimer’s disease (AD) at Columbia University for whom GBA genotype was available (n=82).

Results

4/17 (23.5%) MSA cases carried glucocerebrosidase gene variants, including an individual homozygous for N370S, and one each who were heterozygous carriers of N370S, T369M and R496H. Among the comparator cases with pure AD, 3 of the 82 autopsies (3.7%) carried GBA variants (P = 0.0127, Fisher exact test), including one case each of N370S homozygote, and R496H and T369M heterozygous variant.

Conclusion

We found a higher frequency of glucocerebrosidase variants among pathologically diagnosed MSA cases in our brain bank compared to AD autopsies. This study demonstrates the need for further investigation into the role of glucocerebrosidase and lysosomal dysfunction in the etiology of MSA.

Introduction

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is an adult onset, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction, and corticospinal system dysfunction. Neuropathologically, there are α-synuclein accumulations in oligodendroglial cells, forming glial cytoplasmic inclusions.

One proposed mechanism for the development of MSA is disturbance of the elimination pathway for α-synuclein. Intracellular α-synuclein can be degraded by either the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) or by autophagy, which is the lysosomal pathway for degrading proteins and organelles. Several studies have demonstrated alteration of the UPS and autophagy pathways in models of MSA1–4.

Glucocerebrosidase (GCase), encoded by the Glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA), is an enzyme involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids5. Homozygous mutations of this gene result in Gaucher’s disease (GD), a rare lysosomal storage disease. Though GD is present across all ethnicities, it is much more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population6. People diagnosed with the α-synucleinopathies Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are 5–10 fold7 and 8 fold8 (respectively) more likely to carry GBA variants than healthy controls. The prevalence of GBA variants in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been found to be similar to the prevalence in controls9. Studies of the association between GBA variants and MSA have been inconclusive10–16.

A recent, large study12 including 969 MSA patients and 1,509 healthy controls from Japan, Europe, and North America found significantly increased odds for GBA variants in MSA patients compared to controls. The strongest association was in the North American cohort, with a GBA variant prevalence of 2.91% among MSA patients compared to 0.34% among controls. Though this study was the best-powered, it lacked pathologic confirmation of most of the MSA diagnoses, and did not report on Jewish ancestry. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of GBA variants among MSA brains (n=17) and compare variant frequency to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains (n=82), collected in the same brain bank. As there are roughly 1.1 million people who identify as Jewish in NYC alone17, this allowed us to investigate the prevalence of GBA variants among pathologically confirmed MSA and AD brains in a population enriched with Jewish people.

Methods

MSA brains

All patients had pathologically proven MSA between 2002 and 2016 and had been evaluated at the Columbia Movement Disorders Center at least once prior to demise. Clinical information was extracted from clinical charts and, when available, interview with surviving family members. These findings are summarized in Table 1. Of the 40 MSA brains in the Columbia University Brain Bank, 17 had tissue available for DNA extraction and GBA gene sequencing. The other 24 brains were autopsied prior to 2002, or had no frozen tissue available for DNA extraction and reliable sequencing.

DNA extraction and GBA gene sequencing

Genomic DNA (50–80ng) was extracted from frozen brain tissue after proteinase K digestion, phenol chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. PCR was used to amplify fragments suitable for Sanger sequencing using either long range PCR or exon specific PCR. Most DNA samples were amplified for a 7036 bp fragment using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA). The 7036 bp PCR fragment ensured that all GBA exons could be sequenced from one PCR fragment without interference from the GBA pseudogene. A smaller subset of patients, for whom long range PCR was not possible, were PCR amplified with FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) for each exon of GBA. Primer sequences for the single exon fragments were also chosen to avoid amplification of the GBA pseudogene and are available upon request. Following PCR amplification, both long range PCR and exon specific PCR fragments were cleaned enzymatically with ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer instructions. Samples were sequenced in both the forward and reverse direction for the full coding sequence of GBA using ABI BigDye Terminator chemistry (v1.1) and visualized on an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer. ABI sequencer files for each sample were compared to GBA consensus sequence to identify variants using Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics, State College, PA). We did also attempt to perform DNA extraction from brains that had only formalin fixed tissue banked, but were unable to produce DNA for sequencing from these brains.

Alzheimer’s disease brains

To compare GBA variant frequency between MSA brains and non-synucleinopathy-related brains we used the brain bank at Columbia University for comparator cases. Because of the rarity of “controls” without neuropathology in this age range, we chose as comparators all brains with a primary neuropathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease between 2002 and 2016, with no secondary diagnosis other than ischemic change or stroke, in particular with no Lewy body pathology, but having available GBA genotype. These brains were collected under the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) protocol, and the genotyping method as well as GBA variants were previously reported19. Demographic and clinical information including Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry were extracted from clinical charts, interview with surviving family members and treating clinicians. In total, 82 AD brains were included in this study.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and range) were reported for the continuous variables age of onset, age of death, and duration of disease. Absolute values with percentages were given for dichotomous variables. Fisher exact tests were performed to determine statistical significance.

Results

Clinical phenotypes of cases included 9 MSA, parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) and 8 MSA, cerebellar variant (MSA-C). Mean age of all MSA patients at onset of disease was 59.94 +/− 9.3 (41–75), and average age at death was 66.8 +/− 8.04 (47–79). Average age at death of AD patients was 81.1 years +/− 11.0 (49–97). Average duration of disease for MSA cases from symptom onset to death was 7.59 +/− 3.28 (3–13) years. There were 6 MSA patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (35.3%), 7 non-Jewish Caucasian European descent (41.2%), 1 of Japanese descent (5.9%), and 3 of unknown non-Jewish ethnicity (17.6%). For the AD brains, there were 15 of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (18.3%).

Of the 17 MSA brains tested, 4 (23.5%) had at least one known GBA variant, while 3 (3.7%) of the 82 AD brains tested had GBA variants (p=0.0127). The 4 MSA cases with GBA variants are described below. One MSA patient (case 4) was homozygous for the N370S mutation but was not diagnosed with Gaucher’s disease when alive. The other three cases were heterozygous carriers of either T369M, N370S, or R496H. One AD patient was homozygous for N370S. The other two AD patients with variants were one T396M heterozygote and one R463C heterozygote.

Of the six MSA patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, as self-identified in clinical charts, three carried GBA variants (50%) (two with N370S, one with R496H) and three did not. There were one out of 15 AD patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent who harbored GBA variants (6.7%), compared to 50% among Jewish MSA brains (p = 0.0175). Among non-Jewish, 1/11 (9.1%) in the MSA cohort, and 2/67 (3.0%) in the AD cohort had GBA variants (p = 0.46).

Table 1 compares clinical characteristics of MSA and AD patients with or without GBA variants. Table 2 describes clinical characteristics of the MSA patients with GBA variants in our cohort.

Cases

MSA Case 1

This patient was of western European descent with no family history of parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia. Symptoms began at age 52 with right hand rest tremor, slowness, stiffness, “shuffling” gait with stooped posture and reduced arm swing. There was no benefit from levodopa or dopamine agonists. The patient developed micrographia, falls, freezing of gait, urinary retention requiring intermittent self-catheterization, erectile dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, drooling, dysphagia, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and cognitive complaints. Initial diagnosis was normal pressure hydrocephalus and the patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, without improvement. On exam at four years after onset, modified mini-mental state examination score was 53/5717, there were square wave jerks without nystagmus, normal reflexes, hypomimia, and symmetric bradykinesia and rigidity with myoclonus. Gait exam revealed stooped posture, difficulty rising from chair, short strides, en-bloc turning, mild postural instability, and absent arm swing. Brain MRI demonstrated dilated ventricles and periventricular white matter disease. FDG-PET demonstrated bilateral reductions in striatal glucose metabolism consistent with an atypical parkinsonian syndrome. The patient died at age 61 after a nine year disease course. Gross pathological examination revealed mild atherosclerotic disease in the large blood vessels of the brain and severe atrophy in the putamen and caudate. Microscopic evaluation revealed scattered glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) throughout the cerebral cortex, red nucleus, and basal ganglia. Occasional neurons labeled with anti-synuclein antibodies, without Lewy Bodies. There were tau-positive staining neurons and neuropils in the temporal lobe, but no neuritic plaques. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of MSA of the striato-nigral type. GBA genotyping revealed a heterozygous T369M variant.

MSA Case 2

Case 2 was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with a family history significant for a mother with life-long head tremor, father with bilateral hand tremors, and a paternal uncle and paternal cousin with Parkinson disease. Symptoms started at age 56 with hoarse voice and urinary urgency and incontinence. One year later the patient developed stiffness and discomfort in the left arm, clumsiness in the left hand, breathlessness and stridor, dysphagia, RBD, and balance difficulties with falls. The patient reported constipation, lightheadedness with standing, and cognitive changes without hallucinations. Levodopa had a modest effect. On examination one year after symptom onset there was an orthostatic blood pressure drop, and normal mental status. Movement disorders examination revealed hypometric saccades, hypomimia, no tremor, no dysmetria, with asymmetric bradykinesia. Reflexes were brisk, with equivocal plantar responses. Gait exam revealed stooped posture, normal base, and reduced arm swing. MRI of the brain demonstrated cerebellar atrophy. The patient later developed neck dystonia and postural instability, and was wheelchair bound four years after onset. The patient died seven years after onset of symptoms. Gross pathologic examination revealed mild global atrophy, with marked atrophy of the putamen, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. Microscopic examination revealed scattered GCIs and rare neuronal inclusions, but no Lewy Bodies. There was neuronal loss and gliosis throughout the basal ganglia and cerebellum. Rare neurofibrillary tangles were found in the entorhinal cortex without other Alzheimer’s pathology. These findings were consistent with pathologic diagnosis of MSA, mixed type with features of both olivopontocerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration. GBA genotyping revealed a homozygous N370S mutation. The patient had known anemia and Factor VIII and XI deficiency, though Gaucher’s disease was not diagnosed during life.

MSA Case 3

Case 3 was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and had no family history of movement abnormalities. Symptoms started at age 59 with balance problems, falls and a change in golf swing. The patient developed speech changes, reflex blepharospasm, and difficulty with handwriting and typing. By five years into the disease, the patient required a walker and 24 hour assistance. The patient developed constipation, dysphagia, stridor, behavioral symptoms (agitation/anger), severe urinary retention requiring percutaneous catheter, kinetic tremor, painful leg dystonia, and anterocollis. There was no significant response to levodopa. Brain MRI brain demonstrated cerebellar atrophy with non-specific T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the pons and cerebellar peduncles. On examination five years after onset, the patient had an asymptomatic orthostatic blood pressure drop, normal mental status exam, no nystagmus, absent optokinetic nystagmus, saccadic breakdown of smooth pursuit, hypermetric saccades, and brisk reflexes. There was prominent dysmetria in all extremities, and speech was nasal and scanning. There was hypomimia, bradykinesia on the right, and truncal titubation. The patient was unable to rise from a chair without using the arms. Gait was broad-based and ataxic, with spontaneous falling. The patient died after a disease duration of eight years. Gross pathologic examination revealed marked atrophy of the putamen and globus pallidus externa, brainstem, and cerebellum, and pallor of the substantia nigra and nucleus coeruleus. On microscopic examination, there were diffuse GCIs in cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, striatum, hypothalamus, and olfactory tract and bulb. There were very few tau-positive pre-tangles in the amygdala, without evidence of other Alzheimer’s pathology. These pathologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of MSA, with mixed striato-nigral and olivo-ponto-cerebellar type. GBA genotyping revealed a heterozygous N370S mutation.

MSA Case 4

Case 4 was of Ashkenazi Jewish descent with no family history of neurologic disorders. Symptoms began at age 53 with unsteady gait and falls. Other complaints included numbness in the feet and tingling in the right hand, depression and anxiety, slurred speech, dysphagia, constipation, difficulty with manual dexterity, diplopia, right sided ptosis and reflex blepharospasm, RBD, urinary frequency and urgency, and lightheadedness which later progressed to severe orthostasis with syncope. Brain MRI demonstrated hyperintense FLAIR signal in cerebellum and cerebellar peduncle. The patient required a walker early, and a wheelchair by five years. On examination one year after onset there was a modest orthostatic blood pressure drop, dysarthria, saccadic breakdown of smooth pursuit, and nystagmus. There was dysmetria in the extremities, reduced sensation in the feet, an ataxic gait, and hyperreflexia bilaterally. The patient later developed hypomimia, hypophonia, and bradykinesia on examination. Eight years after symptom onset, the patient developed recurrent abdominal discomfort and vomiting, and died. Gross pathologic examination demonstrated scattered atherosclerotic plaques and mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. The brainstem and cerebellum were markedly atrophic. On microscopic examination, GCI were found within the cortex, subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, pons, and cerebellum. The subcortical white matter showed areas that were pale and vacuolated, which labeled with antibodies against amyloid, likely secondary to terminal hypoxic-ischemic episode. There was subtotal loss of the pontine nuclei, myelin of the pontocerebellar fibers, olivocerebellar fibers, and the middle cerebellar peduncle. There were rare phosphorylated tau labeled neurons and neuropil threads in the temporal lobe. These findings were felt to be consistent with MSA, predominantly OPCA. GBA sequencing revealed a heterozygous R496H mutation.

Discussion

In this study we found a higher proportion of GBA variants in MSA brains at the brain bank at Columbia University (23.5%), compared to that among AD brains (3.7%). There have been seven previous studies examining the association between GBA variants and MSA10–16 (Table 3). Six studies have found no association between GBA variants and MSA. Some of these studies were limited by small sample sizes, lack of pathological confirmation of MSA diagnosis, methods of genetic testing (full sequencing of GBA versus genotyping 1–2 known mutations), and/or lack of inclusion of ethnic groups known to have a high prevalence of GBA variants (i.e. Ashkenazi Jewish). (Table 3). However, the largest clinical study to date identified an association between GBA variants and MSA.

There are several published reports from this brain bank regarding the frequency of GBA variants in other groups. A previously published study from the Columbia University brain bank reported GBA variants in 6 of 60 (10%) of those with primary AD pathology (although 2 of these 6 cases had at least some trace of synuclein pathology) and in 1 of 32 (3%) of those without AD or Lewy body pathology, which is significantly lower than the GBA frequency in our MSA cohort (p = 0.0432, Fisher Exact)19. The population allele frequency for R496H is 0.0003, 0.002210 for N370S, and 0.006571 for T369M20. Among Ashkenazi Jews, the allele frequencies for R496H and N370S have been found to be 0.0048 and 0.0515, respectively21.

The frequency of GBA variants among Jewish controls in the United States was found to be 7.1%22, and 16.9–18.4% among Jews in New York with early onset PD22, 23. In the current study, we found GBA variants in 3/6 (50%) MSA subjects of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. In summary, our study found a higher frequency of GBA variants in MSA than in AD. Further, the frequency of GBA variants was higher than previously published frequencies in both PD and in healthy controls.

Though the frequency of GBA variants in this study were higher among those of both Ashkenazi Jewish descent and in those of non-Jewish descent, this association was only statistically significant among Jews. This may be due to power effects, given the lower prevalence of GBA variants in non-Jewish populations.

Dysfunction of glucocerebrosidase, and probably the autophagosomal pathway, may represent one “hit” in what is likely a pathway that requires multiple “hits” for the development of MSA. Other mechanisms that have been implicated in the development of MSA include mitochondrial dysfunction24–27, toxicity of fibrilized α-synuclein28, oxidative stress29, neuroinflammation30, 31, and even prion-like propagation of MSA32. Though the current study makes an argument for the involvement of the pathways for clearance of α-synuclein in the development of MSA, it also makes clear that other mechanisms need further investigation as well.

The major limitation of this study is the small sample size of MSA cases. The small numbers in our series (n=17) does make it difficult to draw concrete conclusions from this study alone. Another limitation of this study is that no healthy control brains were analyzed, though information about GBA variant carrier frequencies have been established worldwide, locally, and even within the same brain bank19, 22, 23, 33–35. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) in MSA did not reveal candidate loci in the GBA gene.36 However, as there are over 200 known disease-causing variants in the GBA gene rather than one single haplotype, GWAS may not detect association signals even though there is a true association. Similarly many GWAS studies in Parkinson disease37–42 and dementia with Lewy Bodies43 have also failed to show at-risk loci within the GBA gene, despite convincing evidence that the association between GBA variants and PD and DLB does exist. The strengths of this study include the pathologic confirmation of MSA and AD diagnoses, and the fact that our sample was drawn from a population with a higher proportion of Ashkenazi Jews compared to the populations in the seven prior investigations, which was reflected in our sample. Also, complete exon sequencing of GBA was performed, which broadened our ability to detect all coding variants.

Given the robust findings in this study, additional investigation of the relationship between GBA variants and MSA is warranted. Future studies should include a larger, international cohort of MSA patients in populations enriched with people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.
