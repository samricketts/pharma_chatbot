Preventive neuroradiology is a new concept supported by a growing literature. The main rationale of preventive neuroradiology is the application of multi-modal brain imaging towards early and subclinical detection of brain disease and subsequent preventive actions through identification of modifiable risk factors. An insightful example of this is in the area of age-related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and dementia with potentially modifiable risk factors such as obesity, diet, sleep, hypertension, diabetes, depression, supplementation, smoking and physical activity. In studying this link between lifestyle and cognitive decline, brain imaging markers may be instrumental as quantitative measures or even indicators of early disease. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the major studies reflecting how lifestyle factors affect the brain and cognition ageing. In this hot topics review we will specifically focus on obesity and physical activity.


Introduction

Preventive neuroradiology is an emerging discipline that has potential to contribute significantly to such efforts. Preventive neuroradiology is the application of multi-modal brain imaging towards early identification of subclinical brain disease prevention through influence of modifiable risk factors. Positioned at the intersection of neurology and psychiatry, it has applications in a multitude of diseases including age-related cognitive decline, mood and psychotic disorders, and a variety of other neuropsychiatric conditions. Preventive neuroradiology also has applications to the recently proposed field of health neuroscience 1, a concept which studies the interplay between the brain and physical health over the life span 1.

A specific area where preventive neuroradiology is having an impact is in the area of age-related cognitive decline. As populations age, the burden of age-related cognitive decline is rising. Globally the number of older persons (aged ≥ 60 years) is expected to more than double, from 841 million people in 2013 to more than 2 billion in 2050 2, with rates of dementia expected to increase from an estimated 44 million people worldwide in 2013 3 to an estimated 75.6 million in 2030, and 136 million in 2050.

The expected precipitous rise in rates of age-related cognitive decline has not, to date, been met with a substantial expansion in treatment options. In fact, current pharmacological therapies for the most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), appear to provide some symptomatic relief but not influence the underlying pathophysiology 4. This signifies the need for focus on increasing our understanding of preventive lifestyle modifications and their neurobiological underpinnings of the disease. For example, with AD, a recent study has highlighted the important role of risk factor reduction for reducing prevalence 5. Barnes and Yaffe 5 explored the role of seven potentially modifiable AD risk factors: diabetes, mid-life hypertension, mid-life obesity, smoking, depression, low educational attainment and physical inactivity. They determined these factors contributed to up to half of AD cases globally (17.2 million), and a 10%–25% reduction in all risk factors could potentially prevent as many as 1.1–3.0 million cases. There is now an emerging literature exploring the effect of these risk factors on neurobiology factors. Other lifestyle factors that have been found to reduce the risk of AD include mind-body exercise (e.g. yoga, tai chi, qi gong 6), conventional physical activity (e.g. aerobic, strength training 6), nutritional supplements (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids, flavanols 7), stress reduction techniques (e.g. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction 8), sleep modification strategies 9, and dietary interventions (e.g. fish consumption, Mediterranean diet) 10.

Classic risk factor studies in dementia are hampered by the difficult phenotyping of the disease with large heterogeneity in severity and presentation, and by the fact that once symptomatic, irreversible brain damage is already present. The paradigm shift in medicine from cure towards prevention calls for identification of potentially modifiable factors that affect disease in an earlier stage. During the past decades, brain imaging has proven instrumental as a means to study brain changes in aging and age-related cognitive decline 11-14. Many new imaging markers have been identified that either serve a quantifiable intermediate factors in the pathway of lifestyle and age-related cognitive decline, or could even indicate disease in an early stage. For example, the hippocampal structure has been shown to be affected both positively and negatively by lifestyle factors using structural, functional and molecular forms of neuroimaging 15, 16. Neuroradiology as a discipline is hence highly important in better understanding the role of these lifestyle factors in positively or negatively affecting structural, functional and molecular radiological correlates.

In this hot topics in research review we explore the potential role for ‘preventive neuroradiology’ in the prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders, using age-related cognitive decline as an example.

Obesity and aged-related cognitive decline

Insights from clinical trials and epidemiology

There is evidence of an association between mid-life obesity and increased risk of dementia. The Barnes and Yaffe model 5 suggests a pooled relative risk (RR) estimate of 1.60 (95% CI: 1.34, 1.92), and approximately 2% (677,000) AD cases worldwide are potentially attributable to mid-life obesity. A recent systematic review 17 identified 10 prospective studies that examined the association between various measures of body weight and dementia, of which 7 were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Three of four studies found that body mass index (BMI) (as a continuous measure) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia; two of five studies indicated that obesity (BMI ≥ 30) was associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia; and 2 of 5 studies found that obesity was associated with an increased risk for AD.

Insights from neurobiology

Commonly proposed mediators for the relationship between higher body tissue adiposity and brain structure at any age include hypercortisolemia, reduced exercise, impaired respiratory function, inflammation, oxidative stress, cardiovascular, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus 18, 19. The co-occurrence of at least three of the following cardiovascular factors including large waist circumference (or adiposity), increased triglycerides, elevated blood pressure, and fasting hyperglycemia has been referred to as “the metabolic syndrome” 20. Adiposity is also associated with insulin resistance and subsequent type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, degenerative joint disease, cancer disease, and lung disease 21. Moreover, an elevated BMI is significantly correlated with a reduction in neuronal fiber bundle length, which is believed to contribute to brain atrophy. Finally, greater brain atrophy may occur in people with central leptin insufficiency, a marker of obesity 18.

Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging

Several studies have investigated the relationship between BMI and brain atrophy. In an early study 18, tensor-based morphometry was used to examine gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume differences in 94 elderly subjects who remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan. When controlling for age, gender, and race, obese subjects with a high BMI (BMI &gt; 30) showed atrophy in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus compared with individuals with a normal BMI (18.5-25). Overweight subjects (BMI: 25-30) had atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona radiata of the WM. Overall brain volume did not differ between overweight and obese persons. In a similar study, Bobb et al. 22 explored 5-year longitudinal associations between change in BMI and gray matter over time, in a cohort of 247 former heavy metal workers and community controls. Higher baseline BMI was associated with greater decline in temporal and occipital GM region of interest (ROI) volumes. Change in BMI over the 5-year period was only associated with change in hippocampal volume and but not other ROIs. Overall, higher BMI was associated with declines in volume in temporal and occipital GM over time. A recent study 23 explored associations between physical activity (PA), BMI, and brain structure in normal aging, MCI, and AD dementia. This study included 963 participants from the multisite Cardiovascular Health Study including healthy controls (n = 724), Alzheimer's dementia patients (n = 104), and people with MCI (n = 135). Physical activity was independently associated with greater whole brain and regional brain volumes and reduced ventricular dilation. People with higher BMI had lower whole brain and regional brain volumes. A physical activity-BMI conjunction analysis showed brain preservation with physical activity and volume loss with increased BMI in overlapping brain regions. See figure 1.

A study by Driscoll et al. 24 explores the influence of midlife obesity on brain atrophy. In this study, associations between global (BMI) and central (waist circumference) midlife obesity and subsequent trajectories of regional brain atrophy in 152 individuals [M (age) = 69 ± 7.8] were examined. After follow-up, 21 individuals became cognitively impaired. Results suggest that midlife obesity may be an important modifier of brain atrophy in individuals who are developing cognitive impairment and dementia, while it has little effect on structural brain integrity in non-demented older adults.

Brain tissue integrity

MRI advancements such as diffusion tensor imaging have more recently been used to quantify subtle changes in WM tract microstructure and connectivity in the senescent and developing adolescent brain. Furthermore, the use of tractography and diffusion pattern statistical analyses is instrumental in allowing for the spatial definition of individual tracts. Research has shown that cerebral WM integrity is decreased in the aging brain, particularly affecting the prefrontal regions 25.

A recent study by Stanek et al. 26 examined the association between BMI and WM integrity. The authors used a diffusion tensor imaging index of tract coherence- fractional anisotropy to examine the structure of the corpus callosum and fornix. This study classified 103 adult participants between 21 and 86 years of age without history of neurological, medical or psychiatric illness according to BMI. Obese persons demonstrated lower fractional anisotropy than normal and overweight persons for all WM indexes, but no fractional anisotropy differences emerged between overweight and normal persons.

Functional imaging

Functional (f)MRI may provide an efficacious method for assessing the impact of adiposity in cognitively intact middle-aged adults as it can identify altered brain activation patterns indicative of cognitive vulnerability 27. Prior work has identified changes in brain activation during cognition in association with elevated BMI 28-30. One recent study explored how a centralized distribution of adiposity relates to brain activation during a working memory task in a cognitively intact middle-aged sample 31. Seventy-three adults, aged 40–60 years, completed a verbal working memory task during fMRI. Central adiposity was assessed with waist circumference. Larger waist circumference was associated with diminished working-memory-related blood-oxygen-level dependent response in the right superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus. Reduced task-related activation in the right superior frontal gyrus and left middle frontal gyrus were related to slower reaction time on the task, controlling for age and education.

Physical activity and aged-related cognitive decline

Insights from clinical trials and epidemiology

Conventional physical activity is one of the most promising therapies for the treatment and prevention of age-related cognitive decline and dementia 4. Importantly, there are a variety of subtypes of physical activity, from aerobic activity, to resistance, to stretching and toning. A recent randomized control trial 32 examined the efficacy of resistance and aerobic training in the improvement of cognitive functions in subjects with subjective MCI. The study occurred over 6-months and involved 86 community-dwelling women aged 70 – 80 years. Physical activity protocols included twice-weekly resistance training, twice-weekly aerobic training or twice-weekly balance and toning training (i.e. control). Resistance training improved selective attention/conflict resolution and associated memory compared with balance and toning training. In contrast, aerobic physical activity improved general balance and mobility and cardiovascular capacity. The study also found aerobic physical activity improved verbal memory and both resistance and aerobic physical activity improved spatial memory. A recent meta-analysis 33 has examined the efficacy of exercise on cognition in older adults with MCI. MCI was diagnosed on documented criteria or via the MMSE. Fourteen RCTs with 1,695 participants aged 65-95 years were utilized. These studies had a duration of 6 to 52 weeks. Overall, 42% of effect sizes were potentially clinically relevant (ES &gt;0.20) with only 8% of cognitive outcomes statistically significant. The meta-analysis revealed negligible but significant effects of exercise on verbal fluency (ES: 0.17 [0.04, 0.30]). No significant benefit was found for additional executive measures, memory, or information processing. The authors critically appraised RCT methods and concluded on a moderate quality with the majority of trial samples being too small for sufficient power. They suggest there is clearly some effect for exercise at moderate to high levels of exertion.

Physical activity is on a continuum with physical inactivity. Worldwide, approximately 13% (nearly 4.3 million) AD cases may be attributable to physical inactivity 5. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis identified 16 prospective studies on the association between physical activity and dementia that included 163,797 non-demented older adults at baseline and 3,219 cases of dementia at follow-up 34. The combined RR in the highest versus lowest physical activity groups was 0.72 for all-cause dementia and 0.55 for AD. The previously mentioned Barnes and Yaffe model suggests a RR of 1.82 for AD 5.

Insights from neurobiology

The biological mechanisms by which cognition is enhanced through physical exercise training remain to be completely elucidated, although the number of studies that have tried to identify these mechanisms has increased in the last 10 years. For the most part, the studies that support the notion that physical exercise has an impact on brain functions have focused on direct biological effects of exercise using both animal and human models 6. However, exercise may enhance cognition indirectly by improving health conditions (i.e. stress, sleep), reducing chronic diseases (i.e. coronary heart diseases) that impact neurocognitive functions, as well as psychological and social effects 35. The molecular mechanisms by which exercise induces angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis have received growing attention in recent years 6.

From a mechanistic perspective, sedentary behaviors may contribute to risk of AD and dementia by two main factors 5, 36. Firstly, they are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic risk factors – diabetes, hypertension, obesity 37 – that are associated with increased risk of dementia 38, 39. Secondly, sedentary behaviors appear to have direct effects on neurobiological processes. A recent review 40 outlines evidence to suggest sedentary behaviors may have detrimental effects on the brain via reducing neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, neurotrophin production, angiogenesis; and by increasing inflammation. Importantly, however, no studies have integrated objective measurements of both sedentary behavior and physical activity with measures of cognition or potential mechanistic outcomes such as neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, regional fat deposits including visceral fat and pericardial fat, disrupted glucose metabolism, and/or inflammation 40.

Imaging studies corroborate these findings of beneficial effects of exercise on brain structure and function. Higher gray and white matter cortical volumes were present on MRI volumetric imaging in both demented and non-demented individuals with better aerobic fitness (VO2 max) 41, 42. MRI studies in non-demented elderly populations also found that bilateral hippocampus volumes are better maintained in fit individuals, with resultant superior performance in tasks related to spatial memory 43. A cross-sectional study by Makizako et al. 44 examined associations between light- and moderate-intensity PA (measured with accelerometers), total duration of physical activity, hippocampal volume, and memory in older adults with MCI. Moderate physical activity was associated with hippocampal volume after controlling for age, but light and total physical activity were not. Both light and moderate physical activity groups were not associated with memory performance. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that moderate physical activity was not directly associated with memory but significantly contributed to hippocampal volume; hippocampal volume loss was significantly and directly associated with poor memory performance. This suggests the benefits of moderate physical activity on memory among older adults with MCI may be mediated by hippocampal volume. Intriguingly, reversal of age-related hippocampus volume loss by 2%, equivalent to 1 to 2 years of volume loss, was observed after exercise training during late adulthood; this finding was accompanied by a concomitant increased serum brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) as well as improved memory function 45

RCTs have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of exercise on brain aging in elderly populations, including in those with dementia, leading to positive effects on brain structure and cognitive performance. Some studies also suggest that these effects may be dependent on the duration, quality, and variety of exercise 46.

No studies have examined the relationship between sedentary behavior and brain structure 40. We hypothesize sedentary behaviors are associated with atrophy of numerous brain regions, particularly the hippocampus. Faster rates of hippocampus volume decay are associated with MCI and AD 47, 48.

Functional imaging

We are aware of one study exploring hippocampal physiology (blood flow) in sedentary older adults 49. In this study, investigators used resting hippocampal cerebral blood flow measures (via arterial spin labeling MRI) and sedentary time/physical activity (via accelerometry) on 33 cognitively health adults (52 – 81 years), 9 of which were Apolipoprotein (APO)E ε4 carriers. Results indicate that the relationship between sedentary time and cerebral blood flow in the left hippocampus differs by APOE status, whereby APOE ε4 carriers show higher cerebral blood flow as a function of longer sedentary time compared to noncarriers, possibly suggesting a cerebral blood flow regulatory response to compensate for metabolic alterations in dementia risk. This data suggest that the relationship between cerebral blood flow and sedentary time is different in APOE ε4 carriers and noncarriers and that sedentary time may act as a behavioral risk factor for cerebral blood flow dysregulation in those at genetic risk for developing AD.

Types of physical activity other than cardiovascular have also been shown to help improve cognitive function. Strength training frequency of at least once per week was associated with greater cerebrovascular perfusion in older women compared to those who those who did not engage in strength training activities 50. A 12 month long, twice-weekly resistance training program in elderly women found functional changes in the regions of the cerebral cortex most strikingly in the left middle temporal gyrus and the left anterior insula to the lateral orbital frontal cortex, associated with improved hemodynamic and response inhibition based on the flanker test performance 51. In addition a 12 month randomized trial of exercise including both cardiovascular and coordination training in older adults showed improved motor fitness was associated with retained or improved hippocampal volumes 52.

Brain tissue integrity

Lifelong aerobic fitness in a small number of elderly athletes was also associated with findings of reduced white matter hyperintensities by 83% compared with sedentary individuals, and higher fractional anisotropy within multiple white matter tracts related to motor control and coordination 53. White matter hyperintensities being a marker of vascular damage. Active exercise in elderly is associated with lower mean diffusivity in the cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe, suggestive of improved microstructural integrity within memory and executive function networks 54. A one year exercise program showed a promising association between improved fitness and increased white matter integrity in the frontal and temporal lobes as well as improved short-term memory, although the cognitive improvements were not independently associated with imaging findings 55. Improvements in temporal lobe connectivity are associated changes in levels of serum growth factors such as BDNF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Insulin-life Growth Factor (IGF)-1; these molecules may serve as biomarkers for neurological function and may underlie the biochemical regulation of white matter plasticity 46, 56.

Molecular imaging

Emerging evidence suggests that higher levels of physical exercise/fitness are associated with reduced amyloid-(A)β burden 57-59 and potentially lowered intracellular tau protein 58, however there are some null findings 60, 61. A recent study 59 aimed to see if plasma Aβ and Aβ brain deposition were associated with physical activity levels, and whether these associations differed between carriers and non-carriers of the APOE ε4 allele. Five-hundred and forty six cognitively intact participants (aged 60-95 years) were included in these analyses, with physical acitivty assessed by questionnaire. A subgroup (n=116) underwent (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to quantify brain amyloid load. After stratification of the cohort based on APOE ε4 allele carriage, it was evident that only non-carriers received the benefit of reduced plasma Aβ from physical activity. Conversely, lower levels of PiB were observed in higher exercising APOE ε4 carriers. Lower plasma Aβ1-42/1-40 and brain amyloid was observed in those reporting higher levels of physical activity. Another recent study 62 explored whether engagement in physical activity might favorably alter the age-dependent evolution of AD-related brain and cognitive changes in a cohort of at-risk, late-middle-aged adults. In this study 317 enrollees underwent an MRI acquisition; a subset also underwent 11C-PiB-PET (n=186) and (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (n=152). There were significant age × physical activity interactions for Aβ burden, glucose metabolism, and hippocampus volume. This suggested that with advancing age, physically active individuals exhibited a lesser degree of biomarker alterations compared with the physically inactive.

Discussion

Summary

Overall the results from this body of work are highly suggestive that the effects of lifestyle factors on cognitive function in aging act through impact on brain structure and function. Neuroimaging studies increasingly reveal structural and functional brain changes in relation to lifestyle factors translate to measurable cognitive differences. This implies that these imaging markers may be effective surrogate markers to be used in trials, or help identify novel pathways to intervene upon.

Clinical and public health implications

There are some more immediate clinical implications for this field. Two areas relevant include rapid, automated quantitation of brain volume 63. This provides a relatively inexpensive means to track brain atrophy and effects of lifestyle interventions; the lower cost compared to analysis by neuroradiologists may make this more available to the community. Additionally, the need for lifestyle modification advice and interventions for adult and late-life individuals is highly relevant to this field given the noted effects of these on the brain. The global mental health implications of neuroscience more broadly were outlined recently 64.

Future directions

In this review we have focused on obesity and physical activity and their effects on the brain. We are aware of a number of other lifestyle factors which require investigation across the neuroimaging modalities. For example, more recent studies have begun to parse out the potential effects of aerobic, resistance, coordinative exercises as well as dual-task interventions in improving structural, functional, and cognitive aspects of aging 65. Other lifestyle factors which may positively affect the brain include mind-body therapies (e.g. yoga, qi gong, tai chi 6), supplements (e.g. omega-3 fatty acids 66, flavanols 67), stress reduction techniques (e.g. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction 6), sleep modification strategies 9 and dietary interventions (e.g. fish consumption 15, Mediterranean diet 68). Other lifestyle factors which impact the brain include smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep and hypertension. Continuing this work is critical for development of treatment plans and may affect health care policy as well as personal philosophies on preventive and therapeutic lifestyle modification. By taking a multifaceted approach at lifestyle modification, one may reap additive or synergistic benefits, even at an early age.

Future studies may help to elucidate the mechanism underlying cognitive improvements, and to help identify target populations in which a longitudinal regimen of non-pharmacologic lifestyle modifications may yield significant health benefits. Furthermore, the lifestyle modification may be tailored to individuals with specific illnesses or genetic predispositions with a feasible, preventive goal in mind. Importantly there are coexisting lifestyle factors and relative lack of premorbid conditions associated with a healthy lifestyle that may act as confounds. This must be carefully considered in future studies.

There are developing literatures exploring the role of preventive neuroradiology in other psychiatric disorders. In depression, a meta-analysis confirmed a direct correlation between increasing depressive episode numbers and decreased hippocampus volume 69. The hippocampus is therefore a potential target for preventive interventions. In schizophrenia, a group of ultrahigh risk subjects were followed longitudinally with structural MRI scans 70. This study found both groups of subjects who subsequently developed psychosis (schizophrenia and affective psychosis) showed reductions in the frontal cortex relative to ultrahigh risk subjects who did not develop psychosis. The subgroup that subsequently developed schizophrenia also showed smaller volumes in the parietal cortex and, at trend level, in the temporal cortex, whereas those who developed an affective psychosis had significantly smaller subgenual cingulate volumes. This also raises targets for preventive interventions.

In preventive neuroradiology, imaging doctors act as actionable information consultants to both referring physicians and their patients in delivering the added value of quantitative neuroimaging. For example, if a neuroradiologist can provide quantitative measurements of hippocampal volume to a geriatric psychiatrist, thereby identifying significant hippocampal volume decrease in a patient with subtle memory loss, it gives that referring physician improved confidence as to the potential etiology of patient symptoms and subsequent management. Such actionable information can also be used to engage patients in brain directed lifestyle programs that can then be reassessed with a combination of clinical assessments and follow up quantitative neuroimaging. In such a new clinic model, neuroradiologists can act as a visible team member for improving patient outcomes. This aspect of preventive neuroradiology is also an illustrative example of value-based imaging that is promoted as important for the future of radiology72.

The top panel shows whole brain 3D maps where regional brain volumes inversely correlated with BMI. The middle panel shows where regional brain volumes positively correlated with physical activity. The lower panel shows regions of significant brain volume differences from both higher BMI and physical activity in a conjunction analysis that identifies brain areas that are independently influenced by these factors.
