Although the main focus in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been an investigation of mechanisms causing Aβ plaque deposition and tau tangle formation, recent studies have shown that phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology is present in up to 50% of sporadic cases. Furthermore, elevated phosphorylated TDP-43 has been associated with more severe AD pathology. Therefore, we hypothesized that TDP-43 may regulate amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) trafficking and tau phosphorylation/aggregation. In order to examine the role of TDP-43 in AD, we developed a transgenic mouse that overexpresses hippocampal and cortical neuronal TDP-43 in a mouse expressing familial mutations (K595N and M596L) in APP and presenilin 1 (PSEN1ΔE9). In our model, increased TDP-43 was related to increased tau aggregation as evidenced by thioflavin S-positive phosphorylated tau, which may implicate TDP-43 expression in pre-tangle formation. In addition, there was increased endosomal/lysosomal localization of APP and reduced Aβ plaque formation with increased TDP-43. Furthermore, there was decreased calcineurin with elevated TDP-43 expression. Since calcineurin is a phosphatase for TDP-43, the decreased calcineurin expression may be one mechanism leading to an increase in accumulation of diffuse phosphorylated TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex. We further show that when TDP-43 is knocked down there is an increase in calcineurin. In our model of selective TDP-43 overexpression in an APP/PSEN1 background, we show that TDP-43 decreases Aβ plaque deposition while increasing abnormal tau aggregation. These observations indicate that TDP-43 may play a role in regulating APP trafficking and tau aggregation. Our data suggest that TDP-43 could be a putative target for therapeutic intervention in AD affecting both Aβ plaque formation and tauopathy.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease is the most frequent form of dementia, accounting for 70 to 80% of all cases. The greatest risk factor for AD is aging; an estimated 30 million people are living with AD and over the next 30 years it is projected to increase to over 130 million worldwide (Dolgin, 2016). In addition, one in three seniors dies with AD or another dementing disease and since 2000, deaths from AD have increased 89% (see 2017 Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, Alzheimer’s &amp; Dementia 2017). The pathology of AD consists of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), which is hyperphosphorylated in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs). In APP/PSEN1 mice, secreted Aβ monomers produced from APP processing disrupt cognitive function, yet there is little or no NFT or NP formation, synaptic loss or neurodegeneration (Abdul et al., 2008; Borchelt et al., 1997; Walsh et al., 2002). Moreover, there are over a hundred transgenic AD models that have been developed exhibiting either Aβ plaque pathogenesis, NFT formation, neuronal loss or cognitive deficits, but only one of which, the APPSwDI/NOS2−/− mouse, induces endogenous tauopathy (Colton et al., 2008; Wilcock et al., 2008).

Although the main focus in AD research has been the investigation of mechanisms associated with Aβ and tau aggregation, recent studies have shown that in up to 50% of late-onset, sporadic cases of AD TDP-43 proteinopathy has been reported as an age-related comorbidity (Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007; Arai et al., 2009; Higashi et al., 2007; Jellinger, 2008; Lippa et al., 2009; Uryu et al., 2008). TDP-43 functions as a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), with two RNA recognition motifs, nuclear localization and export signals, and a glycine-rich domain involved in protein-protein interactions. TDP-43 participates in exon skipping, RNA stability, RNA transport, splicing, translation, micro-RNA processing, and other cellular functions (Buratti et al., 2010; Buratti et al., 2001; Strong et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2004). Similar to tau, pathological TDP-43 becomes hyper-phosphorylated and is present largely as neuronal inclusions or, less frequently, in glial cells (Arai et al., 2006; Neumann et al., 2006). Some studies have shown that TDP-43 proteinopathy may contribute to the cognitive impairment seen in AD (Josephs et al., 2014). Calcineurin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase known to regulate phosphorylation of TDP-43, long-term depression and depotentiation as well as synaptic plasticity and memory (Hodgkiss and Kelly, 1995; Liachko et al., 2016; Mulkey et al., 1994; Zeng et al., 2001). There is evidence that TDP-43 might be functionally involved in APP regulation and tau aggregation. A recent study demonstrated that knocking out TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex in an APP background mouse reduced Aβ plaques, accelerated neurodegeneration, and led to cognitive deficits (LaClair et al., 2016). In order to further characterize the role of TDP-43 in AD, we have developed a mouse model that selectively drives expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex (Camk2a-tTA) in an APP/PSEN1 mouse background. Here we report the biochemical and histological characterization of this mouse model of AD with TDP-43 proteinopathy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mice

Camk2a-tTA (tet-off, Jackson Lab 007004), TetO-hTDP-43 (developed by M. Gitcho and N. Cairns, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and APPswe/PSEN1ΔE9 (APP/PSEN1) (Jackson Lab, 005864) mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background (Jackson Laboratory, stock # 000664) for this study) (Hodgkiss and Kelly, 1995; Liachko et al., 2016; Mulkey et al., 1994; Zeng et al., 2001). TetO-hTDP-43 mice were developed by PCR cloning of human TDP-43 cDNA into the pTRE-Tight response plasmid (Clontech Laboratories, 631059) containing a tetracycline-response element (tetO) and linearized for pronuclear injections at the Washington University Transgenic core facility. Transgenic mice utilized the tetracycline-controlled transactivator protein (tTA, Tet-off) under regulatory control of the hippocampal and cortical neuronal-specific calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (Camk2a, Jackson 003010) promoter (Gossen and Bujard, 1992; Lim et al., 2010; Mayford et al., 1996). Founders were genotyped by PCR using the following primers: TDP-43 forward 5′-GCGTGTACGGTGGGAGGCCTATATA-3′, TDP-43 reverse 5′-AGCATCTGTCTCATCCATTTTTCTTTT-3′; PS1 forward 5′-AATAGAGAACGGCAGGAGCA-3′, PS1 reverse 5′-GCCATGAGGGCACTAATCAT-3′; Camk2a forward 5′-CGCTGTGGGGCATTTTACTTTAG-3′, Camk2a reverse 5′-CATGTCCAGATCGAAATCGTC-3′. All experiments were approved by and performed according to the ethical guidelines provided by the Animal Care and Use Committees at Delaware State University and at the University of Delaware (Animal Facility, G. Talhman and F. Warren) (Borchelt et al., 1997). The following genotypes were evaluated: wildtype, Camk2a-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43, APP/PS1, and Camk2a-tTA/tetO-hTDP-43/APP/PS1.

Primary cortical neuron and human embryonic kidney cell culture

Wildtype mice were crossed with APP/PSEN1 mice to produce E14–E15 embryos genotyped for individual cortical neuronal cultures. After the meninges were removed, the cortices were dissociated with 0.05% trypsin in HBSS for 10 min at 37°C, and then filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer. Cells were plated on poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated plates at 3 × 105 cells/cm2 in CEMEM (10% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) for 45 min in a 37°C humidified incubator (5% CO2). The medium was changed to Neurobasal medium (GIBCO 21103049) with a B27 supplement containing antioxidants (NB plus AO GIBCO, 17504044) to specifically enhance neuronal growth. After 3 days, media was half changed with NB plus AO and then half changed every 2 days (Igaz et al., 2011). Lentivirus was introduced to drive TDP-43 expression (pLenti6.2V5-DEST, DNASU Plasmid Repository, HsCD00329959). Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells were maintained in 5% CO2 and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with either empty vector (pLX304) or pTDP-43-v5 using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, L3000015) or TDP-43 siRNA (5′-rGrCrA rArUrA rGrArC rArGrU rUrArG rArArA rGrArA rGrUG G-3′, 5′-rCrCrA rCrUrU rCrUrU rUrCrU rArArC rUrGrU rCrUrA rUrUrG rCrUrA-3′) and non-targeting control from Trifecta RNAi Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, 13775150) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were lysed 72 hours after transfection.

Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and thioflavin S staining

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 6μm brain sections were dewaxed, hydrated, and microwaved for 3 min in 0.01 M sodium citrate blocked in 5% BSA, 0.3% triton-X in PBS for one hour, and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Standard immunohistochemistry techniques were used as previously described (Gitcho et al., 2009). For thioflavin S staining, paraffin-embedded 6μm sections were incubated with 1% aqueous thioflavin S (Sigma, T1892) for 8 min at room temperature then rinsed with deionized water followed by 3 min in 80% ethanol twice and 3 min in 95% ethanol. Slides were rinsed with 3 changes of deionized water before mounting.

Antibodies

All antibodies used in this study are described in Supplementary Table 1.

Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and proteomics

Western blots were generated using standard protocols as previously (Gitcho et al., 2009). For immunoprecipitation (IP), tissue was lysed in an optimal IP buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 μM sodium orthovanadate, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340). For proteomics, TDP-43 IPs were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with SimplyBlue (Invitrogen, 46-5034), and then excised and digested with trypsin (proteomic results submitted as Davis et al., 2017, Journal of Biological Chemistry). Postmortem human brain cortex, obtained from the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, Washington University School of Medicine, was homogenized in IP buffer, precleared with Protein G agarose beads at 4°C before IP validation. TDP-43 antibody (C-terminal mouse monoclonal), control mouse and rabbit IgG were cross-linked to magnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s protocol and incubated overnight at 4°C (ThermoFisher Scientific, 88805). In order to eliminate non-specific binding, two high salt (50mMTris-HCl pH 7.5, 500mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 0.05% sodium dexoycholate) washes followed by two low salt (50mMTris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1% NP-40, 0.05% sodium dexoycholate) washes were employed before elution and Western blotting.

Mouse transcriptome exon array

RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, 15596026) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. GeneChip Mouse transcriptome array (Affymetrix; wild-type (n=7), APP/PS1 (n=7), Camk2a-tTA/TDP-43 (n=6), and Camk2a-tTA/TDP-43/APP/PS1 (n=7).) was performed under manufactures instructions (Jennifer Holbrook, Biomolecular Core Laboratory at Nemours’ Center for Pediatric Research) and results analyzed using Transcriptome Analysis Console v.2.0 (Affymetrix).

cDNA synthesis and Quantitative Real-time PCR

Cortex and hippocampus was extracted from 9-month-old mice and homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, 15596026). RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, 4368813) with 2 μg of RNA per reaction. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using Maxima SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific, k0241) and LightCycler480 Real-time PCR System (Roche) as previously described (Gitcho et al., 2009). The following primers were used: beta-actin forward 5′-TCCTAGCACCATGAAGATCAAG-3′, beta-actin reverse 5′-GAAGGTGGACAGTGAGGC-3′; APP forward 5′-TGTGCCAGCCAATACCGAA-3′, APP reverse 5′-CCAGAACCTGGTCGAGTGG-3′; MAPT (isoform A) forward 5′-GTCGGAGACCTCCGATGC-3′, MAPT (isoform A) reverse 5′-CCTTCTGGGATCTCCGTGTG-3′; MAPT (isoform D) forward 5′-GGCTTAAAAGCTCGTGTGGC-3′, MAPT (isoform D) reverse 5′-GAGGTGTGGCGATCTTCG-3′, calcineurin forward 5′-TGCAAAGCGCTACTGTTGAG-3′ and calcineurin reverse 5′-GAGGTGGCATCCTCTCGTTA-3′

Statistical analysis

Data analyses were performed using a one or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni or Tukey correction for type-one error (Prism, GraphPad Software). Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n≥3). Biological replicates and littermate controls were evaluated for all the in vivo experiments described.

RESULTS

Mice selectively expressing human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex in an APP/PSEN1 background show no change in splicing

We developed a mouse model that selectively drives expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex in an APP/PS1 mouse background. The tetO-TDP-43 transgenic mice were under control of the hippocampal and cortical neuronal-specific calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (Camk2a, Jackson 003010) promoter (Fig. 1A) (Gossen and Bujard, 1992; Lim et al., 2010; Mayford et al., 1996). Our mating strategy was to first generate double transgenics of Camk2a-tTA(+)/APP/PS1(+). The Camk2a-tTA(+)/APP/PS1(+) mice were crossed with tetO-hTDP-43(+) mice and maintained on a doxycycline diet (Bio-Serve S3888, 200mg/kg) to suppress hTDP-43 expression until weaning (P24) in order to produce Camk2a-tTA(+)//tetO-hTDP-43(+)/APP/PS1(+) mice (Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1). In 9-month old mice, human TDP-43 (Abnova, 555nm) expression was distributed throughout the hippocampus and cortex (Fig. 1B). Expression of human APP was verified through Western blot with human-specific anti-APP (Covance, 6E10) (Fig. 1C &amp; D). Endogenous expression of mouse TDP-43 was significantly reduced in Camk2a-tTA(+)/tetOTDP-43(+) mice (0.39 ± 0.08) and Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 mice (0.43 ± 0.07), however there was an overall 1.45 ± 0.13 fold and 1.49 ± 0.07 fold increase in total TDP-43 expression compared with wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice had no significant change in TDP-43 expression (1.028 ± 0.15). In order to investigate whether this modest change in hTDP-43 expression affects splicing we utilized the Mouse Transcriptome Array and found no significant change in mRNA splicing (wild-type (n=7), APP/PS1 (n=7), Camk2a-tTA/TDP-43 (n=6), and Camk2a-tTA/TDP-43/APP/PS1 (n=7)); Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse transcriptome array table. The total mRNA of some transcripts were significantly increased when comparing WT to APP/PS1 and WT to Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 however, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression when comparing WT to Camk2a/hTDP-43 or WT to Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 (Supplementary Table 2). In addition, we showed no significant change in splicing when comparing all the genotypes described above, which may be due the low level of hTDP-43 expression evaluated in this model (splicing data not shown).

TDP-43 inversely regulates calcineurin expression

Since calcineurin is an essential phosphatase associated with long-term depression and depotentiation and plays a role in synaptic plasticity and memory, we wanted to investigate the role overexpression of TDP-43 has on calcineurin expression in cortical neurons from APP/PS1 mice (Hodgkiss and Kelly, 1995; Mulkey et al., 1994; Zeng et al., 2001). In both wildtype and APP/PS1 primary cortical neurons overexpressing TDP-43, there was a significant decrease in calcineurin expression (WT vs. WT+TDP-43, 0.52 ± 0.09, p=0.002; APP vs. APP+TDP-43, 0.53 ± 0.026, p=0.0112) (Fig. 2A &amp; C). In addition to validating the interaction of TDP-43 and calcineurin, we assayed calcineurin expression in our Camk2a/hTDP-43 transgenic mouse that overexpresses TDP-43 specifically in neurons in the cortex and hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Calcineurin expression was significantly lower in the Camk2a/hTDP-43 versus the non-transgenic control at four months of age (0.58 ± 0.047, n=3, p=0.005) and nine months of age (0.52 ± 0.15 p=0.0003) with no change in mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. 1B–D). In order to determine if TDP-43 affects the expression of calcineurin, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) were transfected with either a non-targeting control (siNTC) or siTDP-43. Knockdown of TDP-43 resulted in an increase in calcineurin (1.7 ± 0.09, p=0.044) suggesting that TDP-43 negatively regulates calcineurin (Fig. 2B &amp; D).

Calcineurin depletion in a C. elegans model of ALS increased phosphorylated TDP-43 and exacerbated motor deficits (Liachko et al., 2016). Furthermore, a yeast hybrid screen identified calcineurin as a binding partner of phosphorylated TDP-43 (S409/410), indicating that the phosphatase calcineurin functionally dephosphorylates pathological TDP-43 (Liachko et al., 2016). This work supports the increase in cytoplasmic phosphorylated TDP-43 observed in our model of hTDP-43 overexpression (Fig. 2E). We also observed phosphorylated TDP-43 in APP/PS1 mice, which is likely due in part to stress causing cytoplasmic TDP-43 localization as seen in a tau mouse model (Ayala et al., 2011a; Clippinger et al., 2013; Herman et al., 2011; Kabuta et al., 2015; Moujalled et al., 2013). (Fig. 2E) It has been shown that hyperphosphorylation occurs post aggregation and may be protective and possibly more soluble (Li et al., 2011). Thus a reduction in calcineurin levels may impede pathogenesis. Although our model of overexpression increased phosphorylated TDP-43 due to changes in calcineurin, in the 9-month old APP/PS1 model, we observe an increase in endogenous phosphorylated TDP-43 that may be an early protective response to stress (Fig. 2E). Thus, marginal increases in TDP-43 phosphorylation may be initially protective possibly by causing a reduction of calcineurin. As the accumulation and aggregation of TDP-43 increases with age this may foster a prion-like aggregation (Li et al., 2011; Mompean et al., 2016). TDP-43 has been show to localize to stress granules prior to forming protein aggregates (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010; Parker et al., 2012) and our data also show that TDP-43 colocalizes with stress granules (TIAR) in mice selectively expressing TDP-43 (Supplementary Fig. 2). This suggests an early accumulation of TIAR/pTDP-43 stress granules that may be initially protective before becoming protein aggregates (Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010; Parker et al., 2012). Collectively, these data indicate a relationship between decreased calcineurin expression and increased TDP-43 phosphorylation that may contribute to AD pathology.

Selective expression of TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex increases endosomal/lysosomal localization of APP

At 9-months of age, the Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 mice show a significant decrease in Aβ plaque deposition when compared to the APP/PS1 littermate controls (Fig. 3A &amp; B). Aβ plaques were counted blindly from hippocampal and cortical sections of three mice per genotype and immunostained with anti-Aβ 1–16 (6E10) antibody. In APP/PS1 there were 18.7±6.1 plaques and only 5.3±2.5 Aβ plaques counted in Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 mice (p=0.025). Since APP is internalized and processed through the endocyticlysosomal system and increased neuronal endocytosis is an early pathological event observed in AD, we used several markers of early and late endosomes and lysosomes to evaluate the intracellular accumulation of APP in Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 mice (Li et al., 2011). Early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and Rab5 were used as immunocytochemical markers for early endosomes whereas Rab7 and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP2A) are markers of late endosomes and lysosomes, respectively. We found that APP co-localized with endosomes at every stage of the endocytic pathway throughout the cortex of both APP/PS1 and Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 mice and appeared to accumulate markedly in lysosomes (Fig. 3 &amp; Supplementary Fig. 3). Expression of TDP-43 did not affect expression of APP mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overexpression of TDP-43 has been shown to induce an increase in autophagy; however, in our model we saw no change in autophagy markers LC3B and ATG12 (Supplementary Fig. 4). These observations may indicate that the marginal increase in TDP-43 expression that we observed was insufficient to induce autophagy (Bose et al., 2011; Ying et al., 2016). Interestingly, endosomal acidification and synaptic vesicle endosomal formation is also tightly linked to calcineurin and might account for the change in APP subcellular trafficking observed in this model.

Phosphorylated tau aggregation in mice expressing TDP-43 resembles AD pathology

In order to evaluate the impact of TDP-43 overexpression on tau phosphorylation in the APP/PS1 mouse, we used immunoblotting to assay changes in phosphorylated tau. We detected a higher molecular weight band of approximately 100kD in mice selectively expressing hTDP-43 alone or hTDP-43 in an APP/PS1 background, which was not detected in wildtype or APP/PS1 littermates (Fig. 4A–C). This 100kD band may indicate aggregation of tau. In Camk2a/hTDP-43/APP/PS1 mice, neurites display diffuse thioflavin S(+) staining that are immunoreactive for phosphorylated tau (pTauSer396) compared with APP/PS1 mice that were Thioflavin S-negative and pTauSer396-positive which may implicate TDP-43 expression in tau pre-tangle formation (Fig. 4D, see arrows). This is similar to what is observed in the AD brain (e.g. an 83-year-old female with AD and Braak NFT stage V) (Fig. 4D). AD cases immunostained with anti-TDP-43 showed a change in localization of endogenous TDP-43 (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, this change in localization did not deplete the nucleus of TDP-43, though the staining in the cytoplasm was thioflavin S-positive (Fig. 4D). We next wanted to investigate whether Tau and TDP-43 interact. Coimmunoprecipation of Tau and TDP-43 in the cortex and/or hippocampus from APP/PS1 and Camk2a-tTA/TDP-43/APP/PS1 mice showed no interaction between soluble Tau and TDP-43 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Recently, a study described an interaction between TDP-43 and Tau mRNA 3′UTR. When TDP-43 interacts with Tau mRNA expression of Tau is suppressed (Gu et al., 2017). When pathological TDP-43 accumulates in the cytoplasm in this TDP-43 M337V ALS mouse model, Tau expression increases and aggregates (Gu et al., 2017). We next examined mouse Tau mRNA isoforms (NM_001038609 isoform A and NM_001285455 isoform D) and human APP mRNA and found that both were not increased due to changes in TDP-43 expression (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results may indicate an early stage of Tau aggregation associated with TDP-43 expression increasing cytoplasmic phosphorylated TDP-43 accumulation. Which supports the role TDP-43 plays in Tau mRNA metabolism described by Gu and colleagues (Gu et al., 2017).

Total TDP-43 colocalizes with thioflavin S and phosphorylated Tau without nuclear depletion of TDP-43 in AD

There is an ongoing debate on whether TDP-43 neurotoxicity stems from nuclear clearance that results in loss of TDP-43 function or a gain of function in the cytoplasm. Several mouse models depict both situations and resemble phenotypes of ALS, FTD, or AD, and display evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, neurotoxicity and motor or cognitive impairments (Cataldo et al., 1997). To investigate whether our mouse model of TDP-43 pathology without nuclear depletion correlated with the human disease, we immunostained neuropathologically well-characterized cases of AD (two females aged 83 years and one male aged 84 years) all with Braak NFT (neocortical) stage V (Fig. 5A, B, &amp; C). Although cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation is noted (cells positive for TDP-43 and thioflavin-S staining), TDP-43 was not depleted from the nucleus (Fig. 5A, B, &amp; C, see arrows). Interestingly, thioflavin S also colocalized with TDP-43 in the cytoplasm in the absence of pTau (Fig. 5A, B, &amp; C, see arrows). These data support the hypothesis that TDP-43 aggregation, amyloid-like structures, may propagate in a prion-like dependent manner (Mompean et al., 2016). Furthermore, we observed thioflavin S and pTAUSer396 colocalized with TDP-43 (Fig. 5A–C, see asterisks). This change in localization of endogenous TDP-43 in some hippocampal cells may be a response to stress induced by severe Aβ plaque deposition and tauopathy.

DISCUSSION

TDP-43 pathology has been described in up to 50% of sporadic and 14% of familial AD cases (Amador-Ortiz et al., 2007; Arai et al., 2009; Higashi et al., 2007; Jellinger, 2008; Lippa et al., 2009; Uryu et al., 2008). One study looked at 342 pathologically determined AD cases and 57% had some degree of comorbid TDP-43 proteinopathy (Josephs et al., 2014). This study also showed that TDP-43 positive subjects were more likely to have cognitive impairment at age of death compared with those without TDP-43 pathology. In order to understand the importance of TDP-43 in AD, we developed a mouse mode that selectively drives human TDP-43 expression in the hippocampus and cortex in an APP/PS1 background.

The phosphatase calcineurin regulates TDP-43 phosphorylation (Liachko et al., 2016). We further validated the interaction of TDP-43 and calcineurin and our data show that changes in expression of TDP-43 inversely regulate calcineurin expression. When TDP-43 is overexpressed in vivo, we show that calcineurin is down regulated thereby increasing accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43. In addition, endogenous phosphorylated TDP-43 accumulates in APP/PS1 mice, which correlates with reduced levels of calcineurin. Interestingly, mutant tau transgenic mice also show an accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43; however, calcineurin levels were not evaluated in that model (Clippinger et al., 2013). Calcineurin protein levels are inversely correlated with dementia severity and Braak stage in the AD brain. Also, when globally normalized, calcineurin levels are reduced in AD brain (Karch et al., 2013). Endosomal acidification and synaptic vesicle endosomal formation is also tightly linked to calcineurin and might account for the change in APP subcellular trafficking observed in our model (Cheung and Cousin, 2013). We further show that overexpression of TDP-43 alone and in an APP/PS1 background increases thioflavin S-positive phosphorylated tau staining and higher molecular weight aggregates of phosphorylated tau. This diffuse staining of thioflavin S may indicate an early stage of aggregation or pre-tangle formation not normally seen in APP/PS1 mice. As with the ALS model described above, when phosphorylated TDP-43 accumulates in the cytoplasm, Tau mRNA becomes more stable and expression is increased (Gu et al., 2017). Though we show no increase in total Tau or phosphorylated Tau (PHF1 or pTauSer396), we do show aggregation, which suggests a role for TDP-43 in Tau aggregation. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology in AD associated with calcineurin levels. In future studies, we plan investigate the role of calcineurin in AD with and without comorbid TDP-43 proteinopathy. These studies may shed light on the relationship between the interaction between TDP-43 calcineurin in AD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies.

A recent study described knocking out TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex and this was proposed as a model of nuclear clearance of TDP-43, similar to that seen in AD (LaClair et al., 2016). Though this model shows severe neuronal loss due to depletion of TDP-43 from the hippocampus and cortex, it does not address the TDP-43 pathology that we describe in our model. In severe cases of AD, we show that endogenous TDP-43 does not become entirely depleted from the nucleus as described previously. During the formation of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions, nuclear TDP-43 appears to be maintained in some of the neurons near Aβ plaques (Fig. 5). TDP-43 has been shown to self-regulate expression by binding to its own mRNA in order to maintain homeostasis (Avendano-Vazquez et al., 2012; Ayala et al., 2011b). We propose that the ability of TDP-43 to self-regulate diminishes as it accumulates in the cytoplasm to form inclusion bodies in AD and possibly other TDP-43 proteinopathies. Therefore, endogenous nuclear TDP-43 might be expected to increase expression in order to maintain homeostasis. We hypothesize that in late stages of AD, accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm may contribute to regulating APP subcellular localization and tau aggregation by increasing nuclear expression of TDP-43. Collectively, our data lead us to conclude that TDP-43 contributes to calcineurin dysregulation, a reduction in Aβ plaque formation, tau aggregation, and accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43. Our current data suggest that TDP-43 could be a putative target for therapeutic intervention in AD by modulating both Aβ plaque formation and tauopathy.

A) Camk2a-tTA mice were crossed with APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Camk2a-tTa or Camk2a-tTA/APP/PS1 mice were then crossed with TetO mice containing human TDP-43 (tetO-hTDP-43) and were fed Doxicycline (Dox) to keep hTDP-43 expression off during development. Mice were weaned 22 days after birth and Dox was removed from their diet. Upon removal of Dox, the tTA expressed from the Camk2a promoter was free to bind to the tetO promoter, thus allowing expression of the human TDP-43 transgene. B) Immunofluorescence staining probed for human-specific TDP-43 (555nm, red, Abnova) and total TDP-43 (488nm, green, ProteinTech Group).

HIGHLIGHTS

Selective overexpression of human TDP-43 in the cortex and hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer disease significantly reduces Aβ plaque formation and increases APP endosomal/lysosomal localization.

Phosphatase calcineurin interacts with TDP-43 and is inversely regulated by changes in TDP-43 expression.

This novel mouse model of TDP-43 overexpression exhibits an increase in phosphorylated TDP-43 and phosphorylated tau similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease.
