Objectives:

Intervention programs designed to improve cognitive ability in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have often focused on physical exercise as a means to improve traditional measures of cognition, with mixed success. Individuals with MCI show high levels of intraindividual variability in response speed (IIV), and IIV may be sensitive to intervention-related changes. The current study evaluated if participants who participated in a physical activity intervention (aerobic or resistance training) showed a reduction in IIV, compared to a balance and tone control group.

Method:

This study was a secondary analysis of the EXercise for Cognition and Everyday Living (EXCEL) Study. Women aged 70–80 years with probable MCI (n = 86) participated in a six-month RCT designed to investigate the effects of different physical exercises on cognitive ability. Participants completed 1-back, task switching, and spatial working memory tasks at baseline, 13 weeks (midpoint) and upon completion of the program.

Results:

Analyses were conducted following both the intent-to-treat principle and complier average casual effect (CACE) modeling. Participants in the intervention group who complied with the program showed reduced IIV on task switching in the CACE models. The intent-to-treat analyses were all non-significant.

Conclusions:

Physical exercise resulted in improved IIV in older adults with probable MCI, showing that IIV is modifiable by lifestyle engagement. IIV may be a useful complementary index of cognitive plasticity particularly amongst those with cognitive impairment.

Cognitive change

pmcOlder individuals who experience objective and subjective cognitive decline that is greater than expected for their age and education are considered to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI; Petersen et al., 1999). These individuals are still capable of living independently, but are at an increased risk of developing dementia (Mitchell &amp; Shiri-Freshki, 2009). Because their cognitive decline is in the early stages, interventions focused on adults with MCI may have a greater likelihood of successfully slowing dementia, compared to later interventions when neurological changes may be impossible to reverse.

As a result, there have been a number of interventions focused on improving cognitive functioning in adults with MCI via cognitive training, activity engagement, and physical exercise. Comprehensive reviews have found that adults with MCI can still show cognitive plasticity and benefit from cognitive training interventions (Li et al., 2011; Simon, Yokomizo, &amp; Bottino, 2012). Activity interventions that focus on the enrichment gained through the environment, such as daily internet-based face-to-face interactions, are also promising for MCI adults (Dodge et al., 2015; Lam, Chan, Leung, Fung, &amp; Leung, 2015). Lastly, randomized controlled trials (RCT) of physical exercise in adults with MCI have found improved objective cognitive performance for the experimental groups (Baker et al., 2010; Lautenschlager et al., 2008; Nagamatsu et al., 2013). The effects have been limited to certain cognitive domains (Colcombe &amp; Kramer, 2003; van Uffelen, Chinapaw, van Mechelen, &amp; Hopman-Rock, 2008) and the findings are inconsistent (Gates, Singh, Sachdev, &amp; Valenzuela, 2013; Zheng, Xia, Zhou, Tao, &amp; Chen, 2016), possibly at least partly due to the heterogeneous nature of MCI (Palmer, Fratiglioni, &amp; Winblad, 2003), though physical exercise has previously been found to be associated with response time (RT) and processing speed (Smith et al., 2010).

However, there is a potential to miss the benefits of an intervention for adults with MCI if the sensitivity of the cognitive outcomes is low. The ability to accurately detect an effect that does exist is even more critical for interventions with MCI adults, as sample sizes of MCI interventions are relatively small (e.g., n = 33, Baker et al., 2010; n = 170, Lautenschlager et al., 2008) compared to those conducted with healthy older adults (e.g., n = 702, Parisi et al., 2014; n = 1635, Sink et al., 2015). Further, given that individuals with MCI are more likely to have some form of neurological dysfunction compared to healthy agers, a behavioral correlate of neurological change and plasticity would be particularly significant.

Intraindividual variability of response speed (IIV) is a promising metric to use to evaluate cognitive plasticity from activity interventions. Within the context of the current study, IIV refers to the within-person trial-to-trial consistency in RT on speeded tasks. IIV is related to average RT, but is also uniquely predictive of various cognitive abilities above and beyond average RT (e.g., Hultsch, MacDonald, Hunter, Levy-Bencheton, &amp; Strauss, 2000). Notably, IIV is associated with some functional outcomes above and beyond traditional measures of cognition. For example, Holtzer, Mahoney, and Verghese (2013) found that IIV (but not RT or accuracy) in a flanker task was associated with gait speed, and Baumeister et al. (2017) found that IIV significantly predicted falls in older adults after accounting for executive functioning, but executive functioning did not predict falls after accounting for IIV.

IIV is associated with lapses in attention (West, Murphy, Armilio, Craik, &amp; Strauss, 2002), but also gradually increases with age through healthy older adulthood (Bielak &amp; Anstey, 2019; Bielak, Cherbuin, Bunce, &amp; Anstey, 2014). Importantly, IIV is theorized to be a sensitive behavioral correlate of the integrity of the central nervous system (Li &amp; Lindenberger, 1999; MacDonald, Hultsch, &amp; Bunce, 2006; MacDonald, Li, &amp; Bäckman, 2009). Specifically, increased IIV is associated with increased risk of compromised cognitive, behavioral, and functional outcomes in older age, including decreased cognitive abilities (Grand, Stawski, &amp; MacDonald, 2016), and poorer health (Bunce, Tzur, Ramchurn, Gain, &amp; Bond, 2008). Moreover, adults with MCI (Christensen et al., 2005; Dixon et al., 2007; Phillips, Haworth, Bayer, &amp; Tales, 2013; Strauss, Bielak, Bunce, Hunter, &amp; Hultsch, 2007; Troyer, Vandermorris, &amp; Murphy, 2016) and various types of dementia (Duchek et al., 2009; Hultsch et al., 2000; Phillips et al., 2013) have consistently been found to show greater IIV than healthy older adults. Baseline levels of IIV have also predicted transition to MCI over 4–5 years (Bielak, Hultsch, Strauss, MacDonald, &amp; Hunter, 2010; Cherbuin, Sachdev, &amp; Anstey, 2010) and the transition from MCI to dementia over 12 months to 4 years (Kochan et al., 2016; Tales et al., 2012). The reliability of high IIV in samples with MCI and dementia, and significant corresponding changes in IIV during the transition to dementia further underscores the sensitivity of IIV to neurological changes.

Given the wide range of potential impairments associated with increased IIV, research examining IIV in older adults has mostly focused on predicting future cognitive and functional declines. However, a small amount of research has begun to examine IIV from an intervention perspective; that is, whether IIV can be reduced either experimentally or through activity programs. From this perspective, positive changes (i.e., decreases) to IIV appear to be dependent on the intervention program itself. Zanesco, King, MacLean, and Saron (2018) investigated the effects of an intensive three-month meditation program and found that participants in the treatment group displayed decreased IIV after the intervention, and that age-related increases in IIV were moderated by levels of continued meditation practice across the 7-year follow-up period. Smart, Segalowitz, Mulligan, Koudys, and Gawryluk (2016) found that a mindfulness training program for older adults with subjective cognitive decline improved IIV after eight weeks in comparison to a control group who received education on cognitive aging. As meditation and mindfulness ostensibly train individuals to focus their attention, it is possible that this results in fewer lapses in attention (West et al., 2002), and therefore decreased IIV. Secondary analyses of whether other more general intervention programs showed improvements in IIV in typically aging adults have had varying degrees of success. Brydges, Carlson, Andrews, Rebok, and Bielak (2020) found a dose-dependent relationship between IIV improvement and two years of volunteer work in elementary schools in men, but not women, possibly through indirectly training attention as the intervention required sustained attention and executive functions to flexibly switch between volunteer roles. Conversely, Brydges and Bielak (2019), and Bielak and Brydges (2019) found no improvements after sustained cognitive engagement (learning new skills) and mild physical activity (walking two times per week) intervention programs, respectively.

It is possible that these interventions had limited impact on IIV due to the intervention programs not focusing on improving attention and/or not being progressive in nature (i.e., did not increase in difficulty as participants’ performance improved). Alternatively, it may be the case that the observed effect sizes are very small due to these studies exclusively examining typically aging older adults, who are likely to be performing at a close to optimal cognitive level for their age. Therefore, these intervention programs may be limited in how much they can improve IIV when participants begin the program with relatively low (i.e., good) IIV. As such, intervention programs targeted towards cognitively impaired populations may be more likely to show improvements in IIV, given that those participants are potentially starting from a worse baseline than an unimpaired population.

To summarize, previous research has suggested that a) IIV is potentially more sensitive to individual differences in cognitive ability than traditional measures of cognitive ability (Baumeister et al., 2017), and b) individuals with MCI and other compromised aging outcomes have increased IIV (Christensen et al., 2005). It is feasible that improvements in cognition as a result of an intervention program may be more apparent if IIV is used as a metric of cognitive ability, especially in these compromised populations. Further, given the hypothesis that IIV is a behavioral index of neurological integrity (Li &amp; Lindenberger, 1999), if IIV is a valid metric of change, it may provide insight to neurological changes as well.

The current study was a reanalysis of data collected by the EXercise for Cognition and Everyday Living (EXCEL) Study, a six-month RCT designed to investigate the effects of different physical exercises (aerobic training; resistance training; and balance and tone as a control condition) on cognitive performance for a group of older women with probable MCI (Nagamatsu et al., 2012, 2013; ten Brinke et al., 2015). The cognitive results found for EXCEL varied based on the exercise condition. Only adults who participated in resistance training for the 6-month period improved their associative memory and executive function ability (Nagamatsu et al., 2012). However, both of the treatment groups (i.e., aerobic training and resistance training) became faster in memorizing the spatial location of items compared to the control group (i.e., balance and tone; Nagamatsu et al., 2013). The aerobic training group also remembered significantly more words on a test of verbal memory compared to the balance and tone group (Nagamatsu et al., 2013). Although positive cognitive changes have been found in some cognitive domains (executive function and memory) for various exercise groups, it is possible that cognitive gains in other domains may have been missed by traditional cognitive outcome measures.

The current study investigated if change in IIV occurred as a result of participating in the EXCEL Study. Given the reported intervention-related improvements in some (but not all) tested cognitive constructs (Nagamatsu et al., 2012, 2013) and changes to brain structure (ten Brinke et al., 2015), it was hypothesized that physical exercise would be associated with enhanced cognitive ability as measured by IIV. Specifically, we predicted that participants assigned to the aerobic training and resistance training conditions would show significant reductions (i.e., improvement) in IIV compared to the participants in the balance and tone (i.e., control) condition. Secondly, we expected this effect to vary as a function of treatment compliance. One limitation of the intention-to-treat (ITT) protocol, which is commonly used to evaluate RCTs, is that this approach includes all participants who completed pre- and post-treatment testing, regardless of actual protocol adherence. As such, we analyzed the data using both the ITT protocol and complier average causal effect (CACE) models, which take into account the degree of compliance and can therefore provide information regarding the dose of exposure (Jo, 2002). CACE models compare those who complied with treatment to those in the control group who would have complied if given the opportunity (Stuart, Perry, Le, &amp; Ialongo, 2008). Specifically, we expected that participants who complied with the intervention protocol would show a reduction in IIV.

Method

As we were conducting secondary analyses on the data, the research ethics committee at Colorado State University declared these analyses exempt from full review. Ethical approval for the EXCEL Study was originally obtained from the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute and the University of British Columbia’s Clinical Research Ethics Board. All participants provided written informed consent. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT00958867.

Participants

Recruitment occurred between April and August 2009. Participants were recruited through advertisements in local media and a memory clinic, and were screened through a standardized telephone interview (N = 285 screened; 111 excluded, 58 withdrew interest) and 30 minute in-person assessment (N = 116 screened; 25 excluded, 5 withdrew interest). Women who lived in Vancouver, Canada, were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: they a) were 70–80 years old; b) were living independently in their own home; c) scored at least 24/30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975); d) scored no higher than 25/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005); e) answered ‘yes’ to the question ‘Do you have any difficulty with your memory?’ (Lautenschlager et al., 2008); f) scored at least 6/8 on the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (Lawton &amp; Brody, 1968); g) had visual acuity of at least 20/40 (with or without corrective lenses); and h) received clearance from their physician to start a supervised exercise program. Participants were considered to have probable MCI due to inclusion criteria d and e, but did not have a clinical diagnosis of MCI. Potential participants were excluded if they a) had a medical condition that could be exacerbated by exercise; b) had regularly participated in resistance or aerobic exercise in the previous 6 months; c) had a neurodegenerative disease such as dementia or history of stroke; d) had a diagnosed psychiatric condition (e.g., depression); e) did not understand and speak English fluently; or f) were on estrogen replacement therapy. The final sample was 86 female participants with an average age of 74.5 years (SD = 3.0). Further demographic details are presented in Table 1. There were no significant between-groups differences in age, education level, or baseline scores on the Physical Activities Scale for the Elderly (Washburn, McAuley, Katula, Mihalko, &amp; Boileau, 1999), Geriatric Depression Scale short form (Yesavage &amp; Sheikh, 1986), MMSE, or MoCA.

Interventions.

Participants were randomized to one of three conditions: resistance exercise (RE; n = 28), aerobic exercise (AE; n = 30), or balance and tone (BAT; n = 28). For each group, the exercise classes began 1 month after baseline assessments and occurred twice per week. All conditions were ran as group sessions conducted by certified fitness instructors who received additional training from the study investigators, in a gym in a research center. The one-hour classes consisted of 10 minutes of warm-up, 40 minutes of the training, and 10 minutes of cool down, and attendance was recorded to measure program compliance. In the AE group, participants completed an outdoor walking program. Training intensity began at 40% of the participant’s age-specific target heart rate, and increased over the first 12 weeks to 70–80%. Exercise intensity was monitored through heart rate monitors, and participants subjectively rated the intensity of their exercise sessions with the Rating of Perceived Exertion (Borg, 1982). This scale ranges from 6 (minimum) to 20 (maximum), and participants were instructed to aim for 13–15. Additionally, participants were asked to increase their walking speed, if they could, when they were able to speak comfortably during the session. In the RE program, exercises were performed using both a Keiser Pressurized Air system and free-weights (see ten Brinke et al., 2015, for a list of specific exercises in the program). In the BAT group, participants completed a series of stretching, range of motion, and balance exercises, and functional and relaxation techniques. In all groups, participants were asked to disclose any adverse effects (i.e., pain or discomfort), at each session. Instructors monitored participants for shortness of breath and angina during the classes.

The AE and RE conditions were considered as intervention groups, as aerobic training and resistance training have previously been found to enhance cognitive ability in typically aging older adults (Cassilhas et al., 2007; Colcombe &amp; Kramer, 2003; Liu-Ambrose et al., 2010). The BAT group acted as a control for confounding variables such as exercise received by travelling to the training centers, social interaction and changes in lifestyle as an indirect result of study participation (Nagamatsu et al., 2012, 2013; ten Brinke et al., 2015).

Measures

Intraindividual Variability.

Intraindividual variability was calculated from the trial latencies of three RT tasks administered on a computer. All RT measures were administered at baseline, the midpoint of the intervention (13 weeks), and upon completion of the intervention (26 weeks). Participants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible in all tasks.

1-Back.

In the 1-back task, letters were sequentially presented on a computer screen. Participants were required to judge whether the target letter was the same or different from the last presented letter. There were 95 trials in total. This task required the use of working memory.

Task-Switching.

The task-switching task required participants to make a judgement about either the value of the digit (higher or lower than 5), or the odd/even nature of the digit by pressing the corresponding key. The focus on either the value or odd/even was indicated by the color of the background (red or blue), and changed from trial to trial. There were 168 trials in total. This task involved attention and cognitive flexibility in switching between completing the two judgement types.

Spatial Working Memory.

The spatial memory task included three conditions. Participants were shown one, two, or three black dots at randomly determined locations on a computer screen for 500 ms. After a brief delay of attending to a fixation cross for 3 s, participants were asked to indicate whether the displayed single red dot was the same location as one of the previous black dots (match, where they would press the ‘m’ key on the keyboard), or at a new location (non-match, the ‘x’ key). There were 120 trials in total (40 per set size, with 50% matching and 50% non-matching).

Covariates.

We controlled for possible effects of age, education, and depressive symptoms at baseline. Education was assessed with a categorical variable, and divided into participants who had up to 12 years of education, and those who had at least some college education. Depressive symptoms were measured using the total score from the Geriatric Depression Scale short form (Yesavage &amp; Sheikh, 1986) at the baseline testing session and were included as a continuous covariate.

Data Preparation

Calculation of Intraindividual Variability.

The following procedures for the calculation of IIV were in accordance with an established protocol in the literature (e.g., Bielak &amp; Anstey, 2019; Hultsch et al., 2000). The calculation procedures were completed separately for each of the three tasks at each of the three time points. Incorrect responses were omitted to account for variability due to accuracy. The correct RTs were trimmed for outliers by removing trials with latencies faster than 150 ms. Additionally, each trial automatically timed out at 2000 ms for the spatial working memory task, and 2500 ms for the task-switching and 1-back tasks. Next, within-participant means and standard deviations were calculated across trials within each task and time point, and any RTs greater than 3 SDs from the mean for that individual were removed. If a participant was missing data on more than 50% of the trials for any task at any time point, they were listwise deleted from analyses, as imputation accuracy is poor when greater than half the items are missing (Burns et al., 2011), which resulted in a final sample size of 77 participants (BAT n = 25; RE n = 25; AE n = 27). The missing values for each trial were imputed using a regression substitution method that forms individualized equations of the RTs across all trials within the task condition. This approach is therefore conservative as it decreases within-participant variation. Next, systematic within (i.e., practice effects) and between-subject (i.e., age group differences in mean RT) sources of variance were removed by regressing, the RT data onto categorical age (70–74 years and 75–80 years), categorical trial number, and their interactions. This process therefore provided residuals that were independent of any confounds of age and trial that could influence the SD (e.g., higher mean RT is associated with higher SD; Hultsch, Strauss, Hunter, &amp; MacDonald, 2008). The residuals were transformed to T-scores (M = 50, SD = 10) to enable comparisons across tasks. Individual standard deviations (ISD) were calculated and used as the measure of IIV. ISD values were computed for each task for each testing period.

Calculation of Intervention Compliance.

Participants were required to attend the exercise classes twice per week for six months (26 weeks), totaling 52 sessions. Participants were considered to have complied with the intervention if they attended at least 50% of the expected classes. This cut-off was chosen to ensure a reasonably high proportion of classes were attended by compliers, and to ensure a relatively even split of compliers and non-compliers. Overall, 49.4% of participants reached this cut-off. When split by group, 48.0% of participants in the RE group, 48.1% in the AE group, and 52.0% in the BAT group achieved this level of compliance.

Statistical Analyses

The data were analyzed with the ITT principle using three-way Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (RM-ANCOVAs) in SPSS version 25 (IBM, Armonk, NY), and also with CACE models and sensitivity analyses in Mplus 8 (Muthén &amp; Muthén, 1988–2017). As compliance data was collected for all participants, the RM-ANCOVAs had time as a within-subjects factor (baseline vs. midpoint vs. post-intervention), and both group (RE vs. AE vs. BAT) and compliance (completed at least 50% of their designated activity vs. did not) as between-subjects factors.

All RM-ANCOVAs and CACE models included age, years of education, and baseline depressive symptoms as covariates. The three ANCOVAs used a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of .017, and post-hoc pairwise comparisons of any statistically significant interactions that included Group as a factor also had Bonferroni adjustment. The CACE models additionally included baseline performance as a covariate. Six CACE models were run across time points (baseline vs. midpoint and baseline vs. post-intervention) and each task (spatial working memory, task-switching, and 1-back). For the CACE models, the two treatment conditions (AE and RE) were combined to maintain statistical power, and were compared to performance in the control (BAT) condition. The following two-step statistical procedure was used when conducting CACE sensitivity analyses: First, a CACE model including group assignment and covariates was run, with covariates allowed to predict intercept and slope in both classes. Second, the exclusion restriction, where the effect of the intervention on the non-compliers is constrained to zero, was removed in order to determine the robustness of this assumption. Additionally, Hedges’ g was calculated as a mean effect size to quantify the change in the compliers above and beyond the non-compliers in the intervention group (in contrast to the CACE models that compared compliers in the treatment group and control participants who would have complied if they were in the treatment group). This was done by creating difference scores for each participant (e.g., 1-back IIV at baseline subtracted from 1-back IIV at midpoint), and then calculating the mean difference between the groups and dividing by the pooled standard deviation. Hedges’ g is similar to Cohen’s d, except it accounts for different sample sizes between groups. Values of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 are often interpreted as small, medium, and large effects, respectively (Cohen, 1992), though recent research suggests that 0.15, 0.40, and 0.75 may be more accurate estimates in the field of gerontology (Brydges, 2019).

Results

ITT Analyses

The ISD values by experimental group and compliance are presented in Table 2, and the main effects and interactions (Time × Group, Time × Compliance, Group × Compliance, and Time × Group × Compliance) of the three RM-ANCOVAs (one for each task) are presented in Table 3. Figure 1 also shows the adjusted means of the interaction terms for each task. In each case, none of the main effects or interactions were statistically significant, and all effect sizes were small (all ηp2≤ .063), with the exception of Time × Compliance interaction for Task-Switching, and the main effect of Time on all three measures. Given there were no significant Group interactions or main effects, this indicates that although improvements can be seen across tasks with time, the intervention conditions had no effect on ISD. Additionally, to test if there were any baseline demographic or neuropsychological differences between compliers and non-compliers that might have affected results, a series of independent-samples t-tests were conducted on each covariate and ISD measure at baseline (differences in education was tested with a chi-square test). No significant differences were observed (all ps &gt; .07).

CACE Analyses

The CACE estimates and associated p values of the six tested models are presented in Table 4. Participants in the treatment conditions who complied with the intervention program displayed decreased ISD on the task-switching task at both time points, and the effect sizes were small to medium. The sensitivity analyses (where the exclusion criteria are relaxed to test its tenability; Jo, 2002) did not affect the results, indicating that these results are insensitive to the exclusion criterion and robust (Stuart et al., 2008). Overall, the results demonstrate that ISD did decrease as a result of complying with the intervention program, depending on the cognitive task.

Discussion

The current study aimed to investigate the effects of physical activity on intraindividual variability in cognitive speed in older adults with probable MCI. Previous research has demonstrated improvements in cognition as a result of an exercise-based intervention in this sample (Nagamatsu et al., 2012, 2013; ten Brinke et al., 2015), and also that IIV can be improved through intervention programs in both typically aging groups (Brydges et al., 2020) and older adults with subjective memory complaints (Smart et al,. 2016). As a result, it was hypothesized that physical activity (specifically, aerobic training and resistance training) would improve IIV, based on the idea that IIV could potentially be a sensitive indicator of cognitive plasticity. The data somewhat supported this hypothesis.

It was predicted that both traditional ITT analyses and CACE analyses that considered the degree to which a participant complied with the protocol would report significant intervention-related improvements in IIV. Previous results from the EXCEL study showed differential improvements for the intervention groups in associative memory, executive functioning, spatial working memory, and verbal memory (Nagamatsu et al., 2012, 2013). In the current study, there were intervention-related improvements in IIV on the task-switching task after both 13 weeks and 26 weeks (p = .029 and .048, respectively) based on the CACE analyses, but not on any task in the ITT analyses. Without claiming these findings as conclusive, the results are nonetheless potentially promising with regards to the utility of IIV as a measure of intervention-based improvement in cognitive ability amongst individuals with MCI. Specifically, our results show the potential for at least some degree of cognitive recovery via physical exercise in older adults with probable MCI, and that the utility of IIV may be highest in more demanding cognitive tasks. Task-switching could potentially be argued to be more difficult than a spatial working memory or 1-back task, and task difficulty is known to exaggerate age-related cognitive declines (Earles, Kersten, Mas, &amp; Miccio, 2004; Li &amp; Lindenberger, 2002; McDowd &amp; Craik, 1988). Therefore, it is possible that only small effects of IIV-based plasticity (e.g., Bielak &amp; Brydges, 2019; Brydges &amp; Bielak, 2019; Brydges et al., 2020) are observed in typically aging older adults because they are at an optimal level of cognitive ability for their age. Conversely, adults aging with signs of possible impairment ostensibly have greater room for improvement on IIV as a result of having a lower starting point (e.g., Smart et al., 2016), particularly on tasks that are more demanding. Previous research has demonstrated that older adults with dementia and MCI have greater IIV than cognitive healthy older adults (Dixon et al., 2007), potentially supporting this idea.

These results are also promising because these effects were observed even with a 50% compliance cut-off. That is, after attending as few as 26 exercise sessions over a six-month period (though the mean number of classes attended amongst compliers was 31.45, SD = 3.52, with the highest compliance being 42 out of a possible 52 sessions), improvements in IIV were observed as a result of aerobic or resistance training. From this, it may be the case that greater compliance and/or a longer intervention program may result in greater reductions in IIV in older adults with probable MCI. This is a marked difference to IIV findings in typically aging older adults: Bielak and Brydges (2019) did not observe any intervention-related improvements in IIV in typically aging sedentary older adults after two years of regular physical activity, nor any significant reductions in IIV for healthy older adults after a 3 month intensive cognitive engagement protocol (i.e., learning quilting, digital photography; Brydges &amp; Bielak, 2019). The contrast in findings supports the idea that intervention programs can have greater effects on sub-optimally aging populations as their cognitive abilities start at a lower baseline than typically aging adults.

Additionally, it is possible that these effects occurred as a result of changes in brain structure as a result of the exercise intervention. IIV is commonly thought to be a behavioral indicator of neurological integrity (Li &amp; Lindenberger, 1999; MacDonald et al., 2006, 2009), and several neurological markers have been proposed to identify MCI in older adults (e.g., van den Berg, Geerlings, Biessels, Nederkoorn, &amp; Kloppenborg, 2018; Zhang et al., 2013). Given that previously published research from the EXCEL Study found increases in brain plasticity in three cortical regions (right lingual and occipital gyri, and right frontal pole; Nagamatsu et al., 2012), and volumetric increases in the hippocampus (ten Brinke et al., 2015), it seems feasible that improvements in IIV are an indirect effect of the intervention program. That is, physical exercise results in neurological changes, which in turn result in decreased IIV, which is believed to be an index of neurological integrity. Moreover, it appears that exercise of a more vigorous nature is required to evoke changes in IIV, as a well-powered mild walking and resistance exercise program did not show any reduction in IIV (Bielak &amp; Brydges, 2019). Future research should consider examining if there are associations between the degree of improvement in IIV and increase in brain plasticity and/or volume to test this hypothesis.

Of note, the four activity RCTs that thus far have shown significant improvement in IIV (Brydges et al., 2020; Smart et al., 2016; Zanesco et al., 2018; the present study) differ in the prescribed activity domain. Although we cannot ignore the other study differences (e.g., sample characteristics, length of the intervention), only three of the four studies involved direct (meditation, mindfulness) or indirect attention training (flexibly switching of school volunteer roles), while the present study focused on aerobic and resistance-based exercise. As such, the mechanisms through which IIV change occurred are likely different. MacDonald, Nyberg, and Bäckman (2006) reviewed the multiple potential neurological causes of IIV and concluded that there is likely more than one explanation for the behavioral expression of greater moment to moment fluctuations in performance. As such, it stands to reason that there would also be more than one environmental path to result in changes in IIV.

The current study is not without limitations. First, the sample size of the study was small. Although it is feasible that larger effects may be observed in a potentially clinical sample (as opposed to a typically aging group) due to a lower baseline of cognitive ability, the present sample was still markedly smaller than similar intervention programs in typically aging adults (e.g., Bielak &amp; Brydges, 2019; Brydges &amp; Bielak, 2019; Brydges et al., 2020). Next, given that the statistical significance of the findings was p =.029 and .048, some caution should be used when interpreting the results. A well-powered replication study should be conducted to determine the veracity of these findings. Additionally, the EXCEL Study did not conduct any follow-up testing. Previous research has found that follow-up cognitive testing several years after the completion of an intervention program can show that the cognitive aging process can be significantly slowed by the intervention, in comparison to a control group, even if cognitive improvements were not observed immediately upon the conclusion of the intervention program (Salthouse, 2015). Relatedly, the pattern of participation was not known. A participant who attended every other treatment session would be recorded as having 50% attendance, which is identical in percent compliance to a participant who only participated in the first half of the intervention. This variation could influence how much benefit was gained from the intervention. Lastly, the sample was entirely female, and it is possible that sex differences may be observed in intervention effectiveness (Brydges et al., 2020; Colcombe &amp; Kramer, 2003).

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether physical activity can cause a reduction in IIV in older adults with probable MCI. Change in IIV was apparent for the aerobic exercise and resistance training groups on the task switching, at midpoint and post-intervention. Previous research has focused on using IIV as a predictor of cognitive and neurological decline (Bielak et al., 2010) and the present study demonstrates that IIV can be a useful index of cognitive plasticity amongst those with cognitive impairment. Further, it demonstrates that IIV can indeed be changed as a result of a person’s lifestyle activity and engagement, and may act as a fruitful complementary measure for evaluating intervention effects on cognitive ability.

Public significance statement:

Intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive speed, or moment-to-moment changes in a person’s performance across multiple trials of a reaction time task is indicative of brain health and is different from traditional cognitive outcomes. Adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who participated in a 6-month exercise intervention showed reductions in IIV, suggesting improved performance. IIV can be used to identify cognitive gains resulting from an activity intervention for those with MCI.
