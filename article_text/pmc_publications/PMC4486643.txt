There is a strong genetic basis for late-onset of Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) and thus far &gt;20 genes/loci have been identified that affect the risk of LOAD. In addition to disease risk, genetic variation at these loci may also affect components of the natural history of AD, such as survival in AD. In this study, we first examined the role of known LOAD genes with survival time in 983 AD patients. We then performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-based association analyses to identify novel loci that may influence survival of AD. Survival analysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression under an additive genetics model. We found multiple nominally significant associations (P&lt;0.01) either within or adjacent to known LOAD genes. Genome-wide SNP analysis identified multiple suggestive novel loci and two of them were also significant in gene-based analysis (CCDC85C and NARS2) that survived after controlling for false-discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05. In summary, we have identified two novel genes for survival in AD that need to be replicated in independent samples. Our findings highlight the importance of focusing on AD-related phenotypes that may help to identify additional genes relevant to AD.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), especially the late-onset form (LOAD), is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia among the elderly [1]. Currently, there are approximately 5 million AD cases in the United States, and about 81.1 million cases worldwide [2]. Due to its long clinical course, AD is a major public health problem. Genetic susceptibility at multiple genes and interactions among them and/or environmental factors likely influence the risk of AD, which has a strong genetic basis with heritability estimates up to 80% [3]. Previous studies have shown that the mean survival in patients with AD ranges from 4 to 9 years [4–18]. While demographic, clinical and environmental factors associated with survival in AD patients have been implicated [19–21], the role of genetic factors affecting survival in AD has not been explored extensively. The effect of APOE*4 allele of APOE on survival in AD has been explored in previous studies [22–26]; however, results have not been conclusive. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified &gt;20 additional susceptibility loci, including BIN1, INPP5D, MEF2C, CD2AP,HLA-DRB1/ HLA-DRB5,TREM2,EPHA1,NME8, ZCWPW1, CLU, PTK2B, CELF1, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, PICALM, SORL1, FERMT2, SLC24A4/ RIN3, DSG2, ABCA7, CD33,TRIP4,TP53INP1, IGHV1-67 and CASS4 [27–34]. In addition to AD risk, genetic variations at these loci may also affect the survival in AD. We have tested this hypothesis by examining the role of known LOAD genes in AD survival. In addition, studies focusing on AD-related phenotypes, like survival in AD, may help to identify additional AD-relevant genes [35] Thus, we have also examined a genome-wide data set to determine if genomic regions contain novel loci associated with AD survival. We have performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and gene-based association analyses and have identified two novel loci for AD survival.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

The AD patients were recruited from Alzheimer’s Research Program (ARP; 1983–1988) and the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at the University of Pittsburgh (1988 to present). A total of 1,886 Probable AD patients were examined between April 1983 and December 2005; details of the cohort are described elsewhere [36]. All subjects received an extensive neuropsychiatric evaluation including medical history and physical examination, neurological history and examination, semi-structured psychiatric interview, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological assessment. Among these patients, 983 had available follow-up data and they are included in this study. Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of these 983 patients. The overall survival time was calculated from the study entry.

Genotyping and quality control of genotype data

Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip as described previously [37, 38]. SNPs with call rate &lt;98% and minor allele frequency (MAF&lt;1%), and failing to adhere to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test (P&lt;1E-06) were removed. Genotypes for two APOE SNPs, rs429358 (E*4) and rs7412 (E*2) were determined either as previously described [39] or using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. For GWAS, a total of 803,323 QC-passed SNPs were selected for analysis.

Statistical analysis

The proportional hazard model was used to examine the risks associated with time to death. The survival analysis was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression under an additive genetics model with adjustments for baseline MMSE score, gender, psychosis (the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms; psychosis was included as a time-dependent covariate), education level and the first four principle components. Single SNP association analyses were performed first in candidate genes and then on the genome-wide data. We also performed the versatile gene-based association (VEGA) analysis [40], which incorporates information from a full set of SNPs within a gene region and accounts for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs and it may provide more power than single SNP analysis to detect novel associations[33]. Survival analyses were done in R. We applied Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control false-discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing correction[41] and used a FDR threshold at 0.05.

Results

Demographic and Clinical Risk factors of AD Survival

The base-line MMSE scores were strongly associated with time to death with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93 to 0.96, P=1.09E-10, Table 2), indicating that AD patients with a higher MMSE score at baseline would have a better survival than patients with a lower baseline MMSE score. Females had a longer survival than males (HR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.86, P=2.76E-04, Table 2). AD patients who had diabetes (HR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.91; P=2.73E-02) and experienced more psychotic symptoms (psychosis) (HR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.65, P=7.63E-04) had a shorter survival than patients without diabetes and psychosis. Age, education level, blood pressure, heart disease, and depression did not relate to survival (Table 2).

Single SNP association analysis in known LOAD genes

We first examined the associations of AD survival with genetic variations in known 27 LOAD genes and the results are presented in Table 3. SNPs in 7 genes (BIN1, INPP5D, HLA-DRB1, RIN3, TRIP4, APOE and CASS4) were associated with AD survival at P&lt;0.01. While SNPs in 4 genes were associated with shorter survival (BIN1/rs12476995, HR=1.25, P=4.75E-04; INPP5D/rs3792117, HR=1.55, P=4.53E-04 RIN3/rs7160605, HR=1.35, P=4.05E-03, and TRIP4/rs1163552, HR=1.46, P=6.61E-03), SNPs in 3 genes were associated with longer survival (HLA-DRB1/rs9392025, HR=0.83, P=2.76E-03, APOE/rs429358, HR=0.83, P=5.02E-03 and CASS4/rs2426622, HR=0.83; P=4.61E-03). However, none of these associations were significant after controlling for FDR at 0.05.

Genome-wide single SNP association analysis

Next we examined our genome-wide data in order to identify potential novel loci for survival in AD patients. Quantile-quantile plot of the observed and expected P values is shown in Supplementary Figure 1, and the Manhattan plot showing association signals is presented in Supplementary Figure 2. In the genome-wide SNP analysis, the genetic inflation factors with and without principal components as covariates, were 1.021 and 1.023, respectively, which indicates that population stratification did not inflate the significance of the test statistics in our data. The top SNP, rs2243170 (P=6.62E-07), was located in the intronic region of IL19 on chromosome 1. There were 4 additional SNPs with P&lt;0.05 in this region (Table 4). Supplementary Figure 3 shows the Linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of IL19. The other top SNPs were, NCKAP5/rs7588354 (P=1.37E-06) on chromosome 2, CCDC85C/rs2400749 (P=2.25E-06) on chromosome 14, NARS2/rs4474465 (P=3.41E-06) on chromosome 11, PKNOX2/rs11601321 (P=8.03E-06) on chromosome 11, SDR9C7/rs840163 (P=2.42E-06) on chromosome 12, and ALDH4A1/rs6695033 (P=3.245E-06) on chromosome 1(Table 4). The regional association plots containing SNPs within 500kb on either side of the top SNP in the top loci are shown in Supplementary Figures 4–10.

Genome-wide gene-based association analysis

Supplementary Figure 11 presents the Manhattan plot of the gene-based P-values. We identified two genes which remained significant after controlling for FDR at 0.05: CCDC85C (P=4.00E-06, FDR=0.03) and NARS2 (P=4.00E-06, FDR=0.03). Interestingly, these two genes are also suggestive loci in genome-wide SNP analysis (see Table 4). Supplementary Figures 12–13 show the LD structure of these two genes. Gene-based analysis also identified ANLN as a suggestive gene (P=8.20E-05, FDR=0.13), but this was not among the top hits in genome-wide SNP analysis (ANLN/rs2392436, P=1.76E-04).

Discussion

In this study we have used a recently described GWAS data of LOAD to examine: 1) if variants in known LOAD genes are associated with survival in AD patients, 2) if additional novel variants in the genome also affect AD survival, irrespective if they are genome-wide significant or not, for hypothesis generation, and 3) if gene-wide analysis provides better power than genome-wide SNP analysis to detect new genes for AD survival. In our primary analysis, we observed 7 significant associations at P&lt;0.01 with survival in AD in known LOAD genes (BIN1, INPP5D, HLA-DRB, RIN3, TRIP4, CASS4 and APOE). These data suggest that at least some of the known LOAD genes may be relevant to affecting survival in AD patients; however, none of these associations remained significant after controlling for FDR at 0.05. Previously, the effect of APOE*4 on survival of AD has been explored in several studies, however, the results were conflicting. Male APOE*4 carriers were found to have a shorter survival than non-carriers but not in females[22], while others found longer survival among APOE*4 carriers [23, 42]. However, in other studies APOE*4 was not found to be related to survival of AD [25, 26]. We found that APOE*4 was significantly associated with longer survival (P=5.02E-03, HR=0.83) in our sample after adjusting for sex, baseline MMSE score, education level and psychosis. A previous study has suggested that the processes increasing the risk of AD may differ from those that determine its clinical course [43]. Thus, although the presence of APOE*4 increases the risk of AD, it may have a different effect on survival among AD patients. This seems to be a plausible interpretation of our findings in which APOE*4 was associated with longer survival among AD patients.

In our genome-wide SNP analysis, we identified multiple novel suggestive loci associated with AD survival, including the top hit at P=6.62E-07 (IL19 on chromosome 1) and 6 loci at P&lt;1E-05 (CCDC85C on chromosome 14 NARS2 on chromosome 11, NCKAP5 on chromosome 2, PKNOX2 on chromosome 11, SDR9C7 on chromosome 12, and ALDH4A1 on chromosome 1). Although these loci are not genome-wide significant and wait confirmation in future studies, we believe they provide insight for future studies as many of them may affect survival through their known associations with AD and other diseases. Especially the top hit, IL19 is a cytokine that belongs to the IL10 cytokine subfamily, which may modulate AD progression[44]. A systemic meta-analysis has suggested an association between IL110 polymorphisms and AD [45, 46]. Furthermore, significant associations between AD and IL10 polymorphism have been reported in Chinese and Italian populations [47, 48]. Polymorphisms in the IL10 gene cluster have also been found to be involved with major depressive disorder [49].

Interestingly, in the genome-wide gene-based analysis, two of these suggestive genes (CCDC85C and NARS2) were gene-wide significance at FDR &lt;0.05. This indicates that gene-based analysis provides additional useful information not captured in the genome-wide SNP analysis, as has also been recently shown in another study [33]. The two genes are biologically relevant to AD. The CCDC85C (coiled-coil domain containing 85C) gene is highly expressed in different brain regions and may play important role in cortical development, especially in the 7 maintenance of radial glia [50]. NARS2 is located immediately adjacent to the GAB2 gene, which has been previously reported to be associated with AD [51]. The NARS2 and GAB2 genes occur in a strong LD block that spans the full lengths of both transcripts.

Our study has few limitations. First, inferences from our results must be interpreted with caution because the actual cause of death was not investigated. Second, the procedure of disease death is very complex and many unknown demographic and clinical variables not included in this study could have confounded our results. Although our gene-based analysis has identified two novel genes that remained significant after controlling for FDR at &lt;0.05, further studies in large and independent samples are needed to replicate these findings.

In summary, our results indicate that genetic variation in some genes associated with LOAD risk may also affect survival of AD. Our study also implicates two novel loci as possible genetic regions associated with overall survival among AD patients. Additional large independent studies are needed to confirm our findings and to further establish the genetic basis of survival in AD.
