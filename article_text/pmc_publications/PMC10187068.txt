The current descriptive qualitative study explored the perceived impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on sleep disturbances and nighttime agitation; the reported use of antipsychotics and other sedating medications; and the overall well-being of older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and their caregivers. One investigator conducted in-depth, phone interviews with care-givers of nursing home residents with ADRD (four family caregivers [FCs], three nurse practitioners [NPs]) and seven FCs of older adults with ADRD who lived with them at home. Caregivers described multiple sleep disturbances. Nighttime agitation symptoms were perceived to continue or worsen, and sedating medications and nonpharmacological interventions were required. Adverse impacts on reported well-being were significant, and impacts were grouped into emotional, social, and physical themes. Caregivers said, “Please don’t forget us,” and requested telehealth support for those at home and technology and human resources for nursing homes to reduce adverse impacts.


pmcBehavioral symptoms and sleep disturbances are pervasive in older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), and their manifestation distresses and burdens caregivers (Alzheimer’s Association, 2021; Roland &amp; Bliwise, 2021). The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased the complexity of providing care for these older adults, leaving providers and policymakers with the realization that the impact is not going away in the foreseeable future. A recent systematic review concluded that COVID-19 social isolation led to exacerbation or manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in older adults with dementia, but the studies reviewed were case studies (n = 2) or surveys (n = 3) with limited outcomes (Manca et al., 2020). A 2022 systematic review of 22 studies (five in the Americas) found that neuropsychiatric symptoms increased during the pandemic (Soysal et al., 2022); however, most studies had small samples and no pre-pandemic evaluation.

In the current study, we aimed to describe the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on two neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbances and nighttime agitation; the reported use of antipsychotics and other sedating medications; and the overall well-being of older adults with ADRD living in nursing and private homes and their caregivers. In addition, we asked caregivers to identify priorities for mitigating any perceived impacts.

METHOD

Design and Setting

The current descriptive qualitative study explored care-givers’ experiences and was performed in the south-central United States during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 pandemic. Visitation in nursing homes (NHs) was restricted in March 2020 to prevent spread of the virus. Procedures for isolation of residents positive for COVID-19 varied, with most facilities either moving residents with COVID-19 to specific units or another facility. Visitation restrictions were partially eased in August 2020 for facilities without active COVID-19 cases in the past 2 weeks, but few facilities met this requirement until May 2021.

Recruitment and Participants

Participants were a convenience sample of family care-givers (FCs) of older adults with ADRD who lived with them at home in the community (FC-Com), FCs of residents with ADRD who lived in nursing homes (FC-NH), and nurse practitioners (NPs) providing care for older adults with ADRD in NHs. After Institutional Review Board approval, volunteers were recruited from geriatric practices, radio advertisements, and professional newsletters. The inclusion criterion was self-designated caregiver for an older adult with ADRD. Additional criteria for NPs were: (a) advanced practice licensure, and (b) full-time NH employment. Inclusion criteria for older adults with ADRD were: (a) aged ≥55 years, (b) residing in a private home or NH, and (c) caregiver reported behavioral symptoms, such as aggression.

Twenty-three individuals expressed interest, and 16 consented. Reasons for declining were not interested, unreachable, or undecided. Two consented caregivers did not meet inclusion criteria. The final sample comprised 11 FCs (mean age = 63.82, SD = 45.03, range = 26 to 78 years, nine females) and three NPs (mean age = 49.67, SD = 4.2, range = 44 to 54 years, all female) who practiced in several NHs.

FCs were not Hispanic or Latino, 10 were White, and one was Asian. Seven were FC-Com and four were FC-NH. Relationship to the older adult with ADRD was spouse or partner (n = 3, 27%), child (n = 4, 36%), or other (n = 4, 36%). Most caregivers were retired (64%) and described their health as good (82%) but reported depressive symptoms. Two FC-Com (18%) and the two older adults they cared for, none of the FC-NH, three (27%) NH residents they cared for, and one (33%) NP contracted COVID-19.

NPs were White; one NP was Hispanic. NPs reported an average of 20.7 years (SD = 9.1) of nursing, 8 years (SD = 4.55) of NH practice, and good health. One NP felt down, depressed, and hopeless with little interest or pleasure in doing things several days per week.

Data Collection and Analysis

The semi-structured interview and follow-up questions were developed by K.C.B., a female RN and doctoral candidate. The guide and questions were refined by K.C.R., a doctorally prepared nurse scientist and specialist in sleep, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and dementia care, and K.R., a doctorally prepared nurse scientist-engineer and specialist in gerontological nursing and technology. Questions were reviewed by the other investigators to guarantee they were appropriate, and pilot tested with a non-participant caregiver volunteer.

Example questions include: (1) “How has COVID-19 affected your loved one?”; (2) “Have there been any changes in their medications?”; and (3) “What could be helpful for your patients/loved ones?” Questions for FCs asked about “your loved ones,” and questions for NPs asked about “your patients.” Investigator K.C.B. conducted one 45- to 75-minute phone interview with each participant. K.C.B. did not provide nursing care to participants and was not known to them. Before the pandemic, she was a FC for an older adult with ADRD and a care manager for older adults. Although her background was useful for understanding what participants were talking about, she made a conscious effort to clarify participants’ perceptions instead of making assumptions. Field notes were made during and after each interview. The investigator and participants were at home during the interviews. Only the caregiver and K.C.B. participated in each phone interview. Participants were informed of the study purpose and that the results would help inform future support for ADRD caregivers. Data were collected from October 2020 to May 2021 and analyzed. Recordings were transcribed by Rev transcription services. Two authors (A.V.-L., E.P.) checked transcripts for accuracy. Demographics were collected using an online survey.

Three investigators (K.C.B., A.V.-L., E.P.) independently coded transcripts using descriptive, thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clark, 2006). Investigator K.R. trained A.V.-L. and E.P. to use the software Dedoose to code the transcripts through demonstration and sharing links to online resources. Data were analyzed concurrently with collection. Investigators (K.C.B., K.C.R., K.R., A.V.-L., E.P.) met weekly to review the transcripts and coding, reach consensus, and develop and refine a code tree. Experienced qualitative coders (K.C.B., K.C.R., K.R.) trained investigators (A.V.-L., E.P.) using a coding tree guide, discussion and feedback, and interrater reliability checks. Investigators discussed the codes inductively, generating categories (themes) to describe perceived impacts of the pandemic and recommendations to mitigate these impacts. Themes were defined collectively. Subsequent transcripts were open coded using deductive thematic analysis and the established code tree. Main coding categories (themes) were created for the tree based on emerging content. Themes were organized under these categories as additional codes were identified; discussion resolved coding disagreements. Data collection and analysis ceased once all items relevant to the study questions were incorporated, themes were coherent, and additional participants or refinements were not yielding any further add-ons.

Discussion of the interviews and evolving coding helped ensure interrater reliability. Bias was minimized by checking for audibility prior to recording, verbatim transcription, comparing transcripts and audio recordings before coding, and reliability checks after coding. Purposive sampling enhanced authenticity and credibility. Member checking increased the credibility of responses.

RESULTS

All 14 interviews were audible and sufficient for coding. Participants gave abundant descriptions of their lives and experiences, their perceptions of the impacts of the pandemic on them and older adults with ADRD, and recommendations for what could be done to mitigate the impacts. Themes associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms were sleep disturbances and nighttime agitation. Impacts associated with well-being were grouped into emotional, social, and physical themes. Overall themes for caregiver recommendations to mitigate the impacts were education and resources, improved technology, more support, and visitation. Findings are presented in Tables 1–3 by group and summarized below.

Sleep Disturbances, Nighttime Agitation, and Sedating Medications and Other Interventions

We grouped the interrelated themes of sleep disturbances, nighttime agitation, and sedating medications and other interventions together because sleep disturbances and nighttime agitation were often described together, and both symptoms were connected to medications and other interventions.

According to FC-NH, some older adults with ADRD had no changes in sleep/wake patterns, some had excessive sleep, and others experienced a new onset of wakefulness accompanied by nighttime agitation behaviors of verbalizations, wandering, and increased falls.

“Her roommate would say that at nighttime, sometimes she’s talking to people, really getting deep into conversations.” [FC-NH #4]

“She has fallen out of bed several times trying to get up at night.” [FC-NH #4]

Other FCs reported ongoing sleep problems that led to nighttime wandering and safety concerns.

“His sleeping patterns have always been strange. He was always up till the wee hours of the morning wandering around. When he was here [at home with caregiver]…we actually had to lock him in the house to keep him from wandering outside.” [FC-NH #3]

In the NH, the FC reported that he continued to wander into other residents’ rooms at night.

FCs requested or gave melatonin:

“And I had him started on melatonin…because that was something that seemed to work without putting him on drugs that would make him more confused.” [FC-NH #3]

One FC described nighttime wakefulness and new medications that reduced awakenings:

“She was getting up a lot more at night until they changed her medication and then that helped.” [FC-NH #4]

FCs expressed concern that NHs would not allow older adults with ADRD to stay because of their nighttime agitation, and sedatives might be needed:

“And they [the NH] can’t keep him if he doesn’t stop it…but they can send him for an evaluation or whatever in order to give him a sedative at night.” [FC-NH #2]

NPs and FC-NH perceived that older adults with ADRD slept excessively:

“Most of them are sleeping a lot more during the day and just overall longer times sleeping…because they’re just bored.” [NP #2]

“…And the lady that’s with her (she has a roommate and she’s ‘all there’) and I asked her one day, I said, ‘Does she keep you up at night?’ And she says, ‘No, not really. She sleeps… and if you let her, she’ll sleep all day.’” [FC-NH #1]

Other residents, previously categorized as good sleepers, experienced disturbed sleep, but the disturbances resolved.

“We did have patients that, they were very good sleepers prior to COVID-19, then they were having broken sleep. As COVID-19 wore on, it seemed like they got a little bit more adjusted and their sleep patterns started to come back.” [NP #3]

NPs reported prescribing non-pharmacological interventions, such as bedtime routines and a regular sleep/wake schedule, and melatonin:

“Try sleep routines. Try to keep on a schedule So it wasn’t really a big change that we did, it was just our normal things, but we just had a little bit more requests for them.” [NP #3]

NPs also reported mixed results for the effectiveness of melatonin:

“We tried melatonin for a few of them. A few of them it helped, majority it didn’t really seem like it helped.” [NP #3]

FC-Com reported that older adults with ADRD had sleep and nighttime agitation problems before the pandemic, the problems worsened during the pandemic, and did not resolve. They described irregular sleep-wake rhythms, increased napping, more nighttime wakefulness and agitation, and loss of day/night sense. One FC-Com described agitation most of the night, without recollection the next morning:

“…He hollered just non-stop in the night. And then in the morning I’d say, ‘Please stop this. You can’t do this. I’ve got to have some sleep in the night.’ He said, ‘What are you talking about? I don’t do anything.’” [FC-Com #2]

FC-Com reported that their sleep was disturbed:

“For about 4 months I didn’t get any sleep and I was just exhausted…. It’s really hurting me because I need to sleep so bad.” [FC-Com #2]

Nighttime awakenings of older adults awakened care-givers and affected their health:

“…Because of…waking up from 1:30 to 3:30 or 4 a.m…it’s really making me very weak, you know, because my system is slowing down.” [FC-Com #6]

NPs also reported sleep issues, leading to general exhaustion and decreased well-being.

Emotional Well-Being

FC-Com were overburdened and verbalized uncertainty, frustration, stress, anger, depression, and isolation, with many reporting using antidepressants and mental health counselors:

“I started a few Zoom counseling sessions. I did some of that in the fall and that helped a lot.” [FC-Com #5]

“It makes me feel like everyday life is uncomfortably constantly changing and I don’t have any way to predict what’s coming. Everything is so uncertain. It is the role of the caregiver, unpredictable and then on top of that, the COVID is also unpredictable.” [FC-Com #1]

For FC-NH, guilt and helplessness dominated. They worried about the health of their older adult with ADRD, and that they felt abandoned in NHs. These feelings were overwhelming:

“But it crushed me. It did. And then you couldn’t go see her for a couple more days, and then I tried to get back in there and make sure everything was okay, and then we got cut off again…. So, it’s been hard on me because I wanted to be there, especially when I go back and find out she’s sick and they wouldn’t have known it.” [FC-NH #1]

NH residents with ADRD experienced increased anxiety and confusion, and misunderstood precautions:

“Trying to keep a mask on an elder patient, it’s almost impossible for them to understand why you’re doing it…. I feel very sad for them because you can’t explain to them, especially the very [cognitively] diminished ones, what’s going on and they just feel hungry for attention.” [NP #2]

FC-NH described a worsening of dementia:

“Everything about her has changed. She doesn’t have her verbal skills, no social skills, no interaction. So, it’s affected her…because I feel like that if COVID didn’t happen and we could still occasionally visit her more, that it wouldn’t be this bad.” [FC-NH #1]

The roles of NPs shifted, as they substituted for family at end-of-life with great emotional costs:

“For the ones that their family cannot be there and they’re passing, it’s just the nursing staff that’s there with them.” [NP #1] In addition, NPs handled misinformation:

“I run into a good portion of people and patients that don’t believe this is real. It’s emotionally draining, dealing with someone who is yelling and screaming cause ‘this is not real.’” [NP #1]

This emotional drain, combined with COVID-19 mortality, was stressful for NPs.

Social Well-Being

Overall, FCs and NPs felt isolated and forgotten. FC-Com reported that they limited going outside their homes to protect the health of the older adults they cared for. One FC reported quitting her job because paid caregivers were no longer available:

“I’m doing a lot better now but I feel depressed but I think it’s mostly because my job was working with people and I don’t get that opportunity to be with people.” [FC-Com #1]

Isolation possibly contributed to adverse health outcomes:

“I never realized how much the patients relied on interaction with a family or friends coming to visit. Especially the ones with advanced dementia, short-term memory, I didn’t think they noticed. But I remember one lady that was very active and happy go lucky. And as soon as the restriction started within, I’d say a couple of months…she just kind of gave up and passed away.” [NP #1]

NPs reported that the long-term care facilities implemented changes to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as more time in rooms, less physical therapy, and fewer activities:

“Activities were suspended for a while…so that, too, had an effect on them. Some of them really enjoy bingo, and now they can’t even go out and bingo, they were stuck in their rooms feeling like they did something wrong, even though they really didn’t…” [NP #4]

“They were isolated in their rooms and couldn’t get out for I don’t know how many months. All she did was sit in a wheel-chair. She was just staring at the walls. I mean, there wasn’t a lot she could do, because she can’t move. She couldn’t wheel herself out.” [NP #3]

“They’ve been more secluded from family, even though they were doing window interviews. It’s just the lack of a touch and lack of their support system from seeing them has definitely made a difference…. So we’ve seen a lot of different aspects of our patients really taking a decline because of this social distancing and very much isolation.” [NP #3]

Physical Well-Being

Caregivers reported less time for self-care with serious health consequences. One FC-Com shared:

“And then…I wasn’t doing my same exercising or taking care of my eating…it was kind of because I was putting more into them, I think, worried about them more. And then, I ended up…about 3 weeks ago…I had emergency surgery…” [FH-Com #3]

Caregivers reported that the emotional toll of stress and worry on top of increased caregiving responsibilities left them exhausted. Some caregivers contracted COVID-19, which affected their caregiving and their health:

“I am really caught between the devil and the deep blue sea because I can’t take care of him anymore…. I came out of COVID on a walker and oxygen. About 10 years aged is what I felt, from before to after.” [FC-Com #2]

Some NH residents with COVID-19 were transferred to different facilities, and their FCs perceived that the transfer exacerbated their anxiety and confusion:

“And she had no symptoms. And she actually had already had, I think, the first COVID shot…and then a bunch of people in her place got it…so they ended up taking them out of the facility because they don’t keep any positives there. And they moved her to another facility that they just have positives…. That probably was the worst part for her because I could go visit her through the window occasionally. And she lost her mind.” [FC-NH #5]

NPs reported that some residents did not eat, had indigestion or other stomach upset requiring medication, and experienced physical decline:

“Some patients have even not wanted to eat, because now they’re not eating in a group, they’re eating separately in their rooms.” [NP #3]

“She was in a wheelchair, but she could move her legs and stuff. Now her legs are in a fetal position because I guess they didn’t do any physical therapy on her.” [NP #3]

“Unnecessary medications were stopped…to reduce the number of pills, and Pepcid® was added.” [NP #1]

Caregiver Recommendations for Mitigating Effects on Older Adults With ADRD and Themselves

Caregivers advocated for increased caregiving and coping support and education. Actions specific for NHs were more visitation, better accessibility for essential health care services, better technology and technology support, and additional health care personnel. Overall, FCs and NPs felt forgotten, and they perceived that older adults with ADRD felt isolated and alone, and they asked that the world “Please not forget us.”

Caregiving Support.

Caregivers were grateful for family and friends, they reported that help from trusted paid caregivers was difficult to obtain, and in-home health care workers were profoundly helpful:

“I can’t leave him alone. I could only go when that aide was here. It would have to be somebody I felt I could trust that wouldn’t rob me blind while I’m gone. You just can’t, well, I need this. I’ll just zip up and run to the store. No, you’ve got to wait.” [FC-Com #2]

FC-NH recommended virtual visitation using appointments and meeting platforms. They stated a need for more NH staff who could assist with virtual visits and provide status updates.

Coping Support.

Respondents reported a variety of coping methods. Self-educating on COVID-19 helped caregivers feel more at ease and capable. Caregivers “recharged” with quiet activities or sitting alone. Exercising, working on projects, virtual meetings with a friend, religion or spirituality, counseling, and “finding the silver lining” were coping mechanisms. Future recommendations included requests for churches to create an active social support network.

Education.

Caregivers believed more education on resources and discussion forums would help:

“…Somebody told me about Meals on Wheels. And they just started that 2 months ago. They started helping us, which that stopped me going to the store.… And I was worried about leaving him.” [FC-Com #7]

“Learning as much knowledge as possible and talking with others who, kind of think like I do, and so we can share that common bond.” [NP #1]

Nursing Homes: More Visitation, Better Accessibility for Essential Health Care Services, Better Technology, and More Time.

NPs recommended protocols that allowed scheduled visitation by family members wearing personal protective equipment and improving accessibility for essential services, such as laboratory tests:

“If our patients need labs, trying to figure out how we can get labs, because we tried to pair up with a company, but it fell through most of the time and we got labs back so, so late…” [NP #4]

FC-NH and NPs suggested use of virtual meeting technology on televisions to help residents stay connected with their families. One FC-NH suggested electronic medical record access for families:

“The thing that would be helpful…and I could’ve got through this with my dad so much easier if they had this, is some kind of electronic log in.” [FC-NH #5]

In addition, NPs spent a large portion of their time trying to connect residents with their family using technology:

“And it takes a lot more time to take care of them, too, because you’re spending more time trying to get the family connected with patients, so if you see them you might FaceTime with family while you’re in the room with the patient.” [NP #4]

DISCUSSION

The current study explored the perspectives of caregivers on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neuropsychiatric symptoms of sleep disturbances and night-time agitation and sedating medications in older adults with ADRD. We also inquired into the well-being of older adults and their caregivers, and their recommendations to diminish any perceived negative impacts. Caregivers perceived that sleep was more disrupted in some older adults with ADRD, agitated behaviors increased, and sedating medications and nonpharmacological interventions were needed to manage these symptoms. Emotional, social, and physical well-being of caregivers, both family and professional, were perceived to be affected as evidenced by their exhaustion, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and worsened physical health. In NHs, providers regretted that they had little time for technology support for family, and some residents were reported to have had a decline in their conditions, perhaps from loneliness. In some situations, health services, such as laboratory tests, were difficult to obtain.

Healthy sleep patterns are synchronized and supported by bright light; regular physical activity; social activities, such as visits with friends and family; regular bedtimes and risetimes; limiting time in bed; and cognitively stimulating activities (Wilfling et al., 2021; Ye &amp; Richards, 2018). Pandemic-imposed social isolation and the increased burden expressed by caregivers at home and in NHs made providing nonpharmacological healthy sleep interventions difficult. Older adults required melatonin and/or sedating medications to manage their sleep problems and nighttime behaviors. NPs reported that melatonin helped some residents but was ineffective for most. Their report is consistent with a recent review that reported low-certainty evidence that melatonin ≤10 mg had little or no positive impact on sleep parameters (McCleery et al., 2016).

FC-Com reported that sleep disturbances and night-time agitation did not resolve over time. Sleep disruption and nighttime agitation compounded the burden of direct caregiving on families (Roland &amp; Bliwise, 2021), perhaps further straining relationships that could lead to suboptimal care (McCurry et al., 2006; Roland &amp; Bliwise, 2021). In a recent review of 35 studies with data from 3,268 caregivers, relative to age-matched control non-caregiver adults, caregivers had significantly lower sleep durations akin to losing 2.42 to 3.5 hours of sleep each week (Gao et al., 2019). The lockdown imposed by the pandemic worsened the ongoing caregiver sleep debt (Merikanto et al., 2022; Pépin et al., 2021).

Caregivers reported that the emotional, social, and physical well-being of older adults with ADRD deteriorated during the pandemic. Increased confusion, anxiety, cognitive decline, physical weakness, and loneliness were reported. Cognitive decline has been reported by others. In a recent literature review of 15 studies examining 6,442 older adults with dementia residing in Europe, South America, and the United Kingdom, nine (60%) studies reported worsened cognition during and after lockdown (Suárez-González et al., 2021). NH residents were often isolated in their rooms. Social isolation increases risk of mortality (Naito et al., 2021). Not only have older adults with ADRD been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2021), but our results and those of others suggest that some residents may have experienced adverse health outcomes from loneliness.

Surprisingly, a recent review reported no existing studies in the United States on the impact of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of FCs of community-dwelling older adults with ADRD (Hughes et al., 2021). In England, a study reported loss of control, uncertainty, and worry (Giebel et al., 2021). A qualitative study of 23 FCs of persons with dementia living at home in the United Kingdom reported negative impacts on caregiver physical health and well-being (Sriram et al., 2021). One cause was withdrawal of formal caregiver support to help with physical care, such as bathing (Sriram et al., 2021). The authors recommended better support, including formal care, respite services, and access to telecare (Sriram et al., 2021). In China, 160 caregivers of persons with neurocognitive disorders were surveyed (Li et al., 2021), and the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and sleep problems was 46.9%, 36.3%, and 9.4%, respectively. Similar to our study, the authors reported that caregivers experienced mental stress and felt isolated and helpless (Li et al., 2021). Caregivers in our study reported that social distancing limitations decreased their ability to provide care and exacerbated their existing challenges, which were already considerable. They reported that their emotional, social, and physical health suffered and that little caregiver assistance was available to relieve them. Our findings suggest that caregivers’ decreased emotional and physical health prompted health decline.

NPs in the current study reported impacts on their sleep, and their emotional, social, and physical well-being. They reported sleep disturbances, high levels of stress, emotional burden, and difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities. A recent meta-analysis estimated the mental health status of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic (Marvaldi et al., 2021). Seventy studies were included, with four from the United States. A high prevalence of anxiety, depression, acute stress, post-traumatic stress, and sleep disorders was present among physicians and nurses (Marvaldi et al., 2021). The authors recommended studies to examine the long-term mental and physical health effects on professional caregivers (Marvaldi et al., 2021).

In the current study, nine of 11 FCs identified as female. Caregiving, especially in persons with dementing illness, may result in physical and mental health burdens for caregivers (Su et al., 2022), and caregivers of older adults with dementia are disproportionately female. Unfortunately, the sample in the current study was too small to examine any gender differences in caregiving experiences, but other studies provide insight. A systematic review of 22 (pre-pandemic) studies reported that female caregivers of older adults with dementing illnesses had higher caregiver burden or care-related stress, and greater impacts on mental and physical health, such as increased psychological distress and depression, compared to male caregivers (Xiong et al., 2020). Similar results were found in a cross-sectional study of 261 informal caregivers (165 female) in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic (Del Río-Lozano et al., 2022). Compared to male caregivers, female caregivers were more likely to experience increases in caregiving intensity and burden and a decline in self-perceived health (Del Río-Lozano et al., 2022). In a study of 84 caregivers of people with dementia in Italy, caregivers’ levels of depression significantly worsened during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown (Altieri &amp; Santangelo, 2021). These findings lend support that the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated gender inequalities in caregiving.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS

In addition to filling a critical gap in our understanding of how caregivers and older adults with ADRD were affected in the United States by the COVID-19 pandemic, strengths of the current study are the inclusion of perspectives of FCs of NH and community-dwelling older adults with ADRD and professionals, focus on two populations at high risk for lasting pandemic-related consequences (i.e., caregivers and older adults with ADRD), and incorporation of caregiver recommendations on how to mitigate the impact. We recognize that behavioral symptoms, cognition, and physical health may worsen over time in older adults with ADRD, and the study design did not allow separation of any ADRD progression versus perceived changes related to the pandemic. Other limitations are those inherent in qualitative design, such as recall bias. Although we acknowledge these limitations, we have attempted to diminish their influence by triangulation from multiple informants, awareness of our biases, and reliability and validity of the study methods.

CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS

Our results provide insight into the lingering distress of older adults with ADRD and their caregivers, family and professional. Health care providers should assess for long-term health conditions associated with chronic caregiver stress, such as sleep disturbances and depression. We recommend mental and physical health interventions involving problem focus, acceptance, and social-emotional support because they have shown health benefits and reduced caregiver depression (Wiegelmann et al., 2021). Because ADRD impacts the entire family, caregiver burden should be considered in evaluating the risk/benefit ratios of treatments for sleep disturbances and makes finding effective solutions of even greater importance.

FC-Com were grateful for the help of friends and family and paid caregivers, but not enough help was available. Caregivers were clear that they felt forgotten. More support is needed, including social service supports, widespread sharing of available resources, respite care options, and advanced digital solutions. Our findings suggest an urgent need for policy and funding decisions that better support older adults with ADRD and their caregivers during the pandemic and normalcy. Priorities include better technology in NHs for virtual visitation, personnel to provide technology assistance, and caregivers, either volunteer or paid, to provide basic needs, such as nutrition and human connection. Volunteer organizations, such as churches or emergency preparedness groups, should consider expanding support for older adults with ADRD and their caregivers.
