Domestic cats (felix catus) are known to develop cognitive impairment and several small series have demonstrated both β-amyloid and tau aggregation, including neurofibrillary tangles, with age, making them a promising physiologic model of AD. We therefore report the largest feline autopsy cohort to date of 32 cats ranging from 1.5 to 22.1 years of age, with systematic neuropathologic assessment according to NIA-Alzheimer’s Association Criteria. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections of brain were obtained retrospectively from cats autopsied at the Iowa State College of Veterinary Medicine. We found β-amyloid staining, predominantly in cortical layers IV and VI in 27 of the 32 cats used in the study, with 4 of these animals showing tau-positive tangles and neuropil threads. In 75% of these cases (3/4) tau deposition was limited to entorhinal cortex while one case showed diffuse positive staining throughout the hippocampal formation and neocortex. This last case showed positive staining for all phospho-tau specific antibodies tested, similar to the pattern seen in human AD. Interestingly, we saw a higher ratio of pre-tangles to tangles than seen in human AD, and none of the cases showed neuritic plaques on any of the stains used. Our findings indicate that aging domestic cats spontaneously develop both β-amyloid and tau pathology similar, but not identical to that seen in human AD. This suggests that the domestic cat may serve as a potential model for mechanistic and therapeutic AD studies, but that additional research is needed to identify differences between the neuropathology of aging in humans and felines.

Introduction

Development of new therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer disease (AD) is handicapped by the lack of naturally occurring animal models. Although transgenic AD models such as the 3xTG-AD mouse have been extremely helpful in early preclinical studies of AD candidate drugs, these models are not physiologic and the limited behavioral complexity of rodents makes phenotypic characterization difficult. As a result candidate drugs validated in rodents have a high rate of failure in clinical trials. Most recently, despite encouraging pre-clinical and early clinical data, aducanumab failed to improve cognitive function in Phase III AD clinical trials (Sevigny et al., 2016, 2017).

Non-human primates pose ethical and logistical challenges, and do not reliably recapitulate human tau pathology. Interestingly, both β-amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles have been reported in both wild Tsushima leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis euptilurus) and captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) (Chambers et al., 2012; Serizawa, Chambers, &amp; Line, 2012). Domestic cats (Felix catus) develop spontaneous β-amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary tangles, in addition to exhibiting signs of cognitive impairment (Chambers et al., 2015; Gunn-Moore et al., 2006; Head et al., 2005; Youssef et al., 2016). However, only a single systematic study of a domestic cat autopsy cohort exists and detailed data on tau phosphorylation patterns and the distribution of β-amyloid pathology is lacking (Chambers et al., 2015).

Because felines have shown promise as a suitable model of AD, we therefore sought to systematically assess AD neuropathologic changes according to standard NIA-Alzheimer’s Association Criteria in a large retrospective cohort of aging community-dwelling domestic cats.

Methods

Brain Samples:

Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue was obtained by searching the necropsy archives of the Iowa State University Department of Veterinary Pathology for all feline autopsies with sampling of the brain from 2012-2018. All animals were domesticated community living pets who were brought to be autopsied after death or euthanasia at the request of either a veterinarian or the owner. The cases used are summarized in Table 2. We identified thirty-two domestic cats ranging from 1.5 years of age to 22.1 years (mean= 14.4 years old) who underwent necropsy during the study period and had suitable formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue available. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, frozen tissue was not available from any of these animals. Twenty-four animals were euthanized under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian using AVMA-approved methods, and 8 died naturally. The most common reasons for euthanasia were chronic kidney disease and neoplasia, and cardiac disease was the most common cause of natural death. Necropsies were carried out by board-certified veterinary pathologists, and were reviewed by one of the authors (JDS), a board-certified veterinary pathologist with particular expertise in veterinary neuropathology, to rule out the presence of any grossly or microscopically evident central nervous system lesions and to identify a suitable coronal section including the hippocampus and thalamus.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed by the Mount Sinai Neuropathology Brain Bank &amp; Research Core. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks were cut at 4-5 um in thickness, placed on charged slides, and baked overnight at 70°C. Utilizing the manufacturer’s directions, IHC was performed on a Ventana Benchmark XT. Antigen retrieval was done using CC1 (Tris/Borate/EDTA buffer, pH 8.0–8.5) for 1 hr followed by primary antibody incubation for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies used include RZ3 (P. Davies Albert Einstein College of Medicine; New York; USA Cat# RZ3, RRID: AB_2716721), PHF1 (P. Davies Albert Einstein College of Medicine; New York; USA Cat# PHF1, RRID: AB_2315150), CP13(P. Davies Albert Einstein College of Medicine; New York; USA Cat# CP13, RRID: AB_2314223), AT8 (Fisher Scientific, Cat# MN1020, RRID: AB_223647), S214 (Invitrogen, Cat#44-742G, RRID: AB_1502105), THR205 (Invitrogen, Cat#44-738G, RRID: AB_2533738), and β-amyloid (BioLegend, Cat# 803003, RRID: AB_2564652) (Table 1). Slides were visualized using an Olympus VS120 6-Slide slide scanner with Olympus OlyVIA software.

Assessment of β-amyloid and tau pathology

All slides were reviewed by a board-certified human neuropathologist with expertise in neurodegenerative neuropathology (MMH). Assessment of β-amyloid and tau pathology was done by adapting the standard NIA-Alzheimer’s Association recommended criteria (Montine et al., 2012). This included assessment of β-amyloid distribution by Thal phase (Alafuzoff et al., 2009) and neuritic plaque density by CERAD criteria (Montine et al., 2012). Tau pathology was assessed by Braak stage (Braak, Alafuzoff, Arzberger, Kretzschmar, &amp; Del Tredici, 2006).

Bielschowsky Staining

Bielschowsky staining was performed at the Mount Sinai Neuropathology Brain Bank &amp; Research Core. Slides were prepared as for immunohistochemistry above. Slides were deparaffinized to distilled water and washed three times. Pre-warmed (45 C) 20% silver nitrate solution was used to stain slides for 30 minutes, followed by a distilled water wash. Slides were heated in 45 C oven for 20 minutes in 20% silver nitrate solution with concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Slides were then placed in 1% ammonium hydroxide for 2 minutes, followed by incubation in developer working solution (40% formaldehyde, citric acid, nitric acid, ammonium hydroxide, distilled water) for 5 minutes. Slides were dipped in 1% ammonium hydroxide and immediately washed with distilled water (3 × 5 mins). 5% sodium thiosulfate solution was used for incubation for 5 minutes, followed by distilled water washes (3 × 5 mins). Finally, slides were dehydrated with 95% ethyl alcohol, absolute alcohol, and xylene, then mounted with resinous medium.

Results

Aging felines show diffuse cortical β amyloid staining

β-amyloid immunohistochemistry was performed on coronal sections including hippocampus for all 32 cats. Staining was positive in 27 of 28 cats over 14 years of age, and negative in all those less than age 14 (Table 2). Positive staining was most prominent in cortical layers IV and VI (Thal phase I, Figure 1). In 9 animals, β-amyloid staining extended into the hippocampus corresponding to Thal Phase II (Figure 2). Extension into the hippocampus, however, did not correlate with age. Some animals showed extension of β-amyloid staining into the basal ganglia (Thal Phase III) but this region was not available in all animals. Assessment of Thal Phases IV-V was not possible due to lack of available sections of the relevant neuroanatomic structures.

A subset of β-amyloid positive animals show tau aggregates

We then examined tau aggregation using an anti-S202/S205 phospho-tau antibody (AT8) commonly used in human neuropathology. We found that four cats, all over 14 years old, showed tau aggregation in hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex. This included tau-positive threads, pre-tangles, and neurofibrillary tangles, although no definite dystrophic neurites were seen. In three cases, staining was limited to the entorhinal cortex with rare tangles seen in the hippocampal formation proper (Braak Stage II). In the 22.1 year old cat, neurofibrillary tangles were seen extending throughout the neocortex (Braak Stage V) although no sections of primary visual cortex were available for staining to identify Braak Stage VI. The tau aggregates seen in this last case showed a phosphorylation pattern similar to that seen in human AD brains using a panel of antibodies to different phospho-tau epitopes (Table 1, Figure 3). Interestingly, this animal also showed a higher proportion of pre-tangles and a lower proportion of mature neurofibrillary tangles than a human AD control by AT8 and Bielschowsky staining (Figure 4).

β-amyloid does not appear to form neuritic plaques in the aging feline brain

Cats with β-amyloid and AT8 staining were assessed for the presence of neuritic plaques using Bielschowsky, β-amyloid, and AT8 staining. No neuritic plaques were seen on β-amyloid or Bielschowsky stains, and there was no evidence of dystrophic neurites on either Bielschowsky or on AT8 immunohistochemistry (Figure 4). All cases therefore received a CERAD neuritic plaque density score of zero, although, as noted above, most showed frequent, diffuse non-neuritic plaques.

Discussion

We found that diffuse β-amyloid deposition is a common pathology in aging domestic cats, seen in 27 of 28 cats 14 year or older. Tau aggregates are seen more rarely (4 of 28 cats age ≥ 14 years) and appear to follow the same pattern of spread seen in human AD patients and have a similar phosphorylation pattern. Interestingly, however, we did not observe any evidence of neuritic plaque formation in any of the animals we studied.

Our findings are broadly in agreement with previous studies showing β-amyloid and tau aggregates in smaller cohorts. In all existing cohorts, β-amyloid deposition, but not neuritic plaque formation, seems to be near-universal in the aging feline brain. The only other large cohort of felines over age 14 reported that 60% of animals showed tau aggregation, whereas we report a rate of 14%. The reason for this difference is unclear. Our study has a larger number of aged animals (28 over age 14 vs. 15) but this is unlikely to account for such a dramatic difference. It is also possible that this difference is due to differences in referral patterns for autopsy, or in sampling. More interestingly, it is also possible that they represent genetic differences in the domestic cat population in different geographic regions (Japan for Chambers et al, and North America for ours). Although specific genetic data on Japanese random-bred domestic cats is lacking, a large phylogenetic study of 596 random-bred domestic felines showed significant genetic differences between populations in East Asia and North America (Lipinski et al., 2008).

Our study is limited by its retrospective nature and by the lack of detailed neurologic information on the deceased cats. Use of surveys such as that designed by Gunn-Moore et al (Gunn-Moore et al., 2006) is unfortunately rare in routine veterinary practice, making it difficult to correlate clinical and neuropathologic findings. Our tissue sections were also limited to those sampled by the original veterinary pathologists, although we were able to obtain sections encompassing thalamus, neocortex and hippocampus in all cases. The lack of sections including primary visual cortex, cerebellum and brainstem also limits our ability to fully stage tau and β-amyloid pathology. Our study is also limited by its reliance on antibodies raised to human phospho tau and β-amyloid. While these antibodies have not been specifically validated in cats, AT8 has been previously used in feline brain (Chambers et al., 2015). In addition, based on the Uniprot database (RRID: SCR_002380), there is 92% overall sequence identity between the human and feline tau and amyloid precursor (APP) proteins, and the region of the tau protein containing all examined phosphoepitopes (190-441) has &gt;99% homology (UniProt Consortium, 2018).

Our findings suggest that aging domestic cats develop both β-amyloid and tau pathology with age, and that the pattern of distribution of both may be similar to what is seen in humans with Alzheimer disease. Interestingly, however, we did not see true neuritic plaques in any of the feline brains we examined and no such plaques have ever been reported in the literature. This suggests that, as has been suggested by some investigators in other domestic animals, β-amyloid and tau aggregation may be unrelated processes in cats, or, alternatively, that β-amyloid can trigger fetal tau aggregation by mechanisms similar, but not identical to those seen in humans. Answering these questions will require large-scale systematic studies of aging cats, with associated neurologic, biochemical and genetic data.

1 Thal phases &gt; III could not be assessed due to lack of available sections.

2 Braak phase VI could not be assessed due to lack of available sections.

3 No sections of striatum were available, precluding assessment of Thal Phase III.

We looked at β-amyloid and tau deposition in the largest published autopsy cohort of aged domestic cats (32 total animals). We found diffuse β-amyloid staining in cortical layers IV and VI in 84% of the cohort overall and 96% of animals over age 14, but there was no presence of the neuritic plaques typically seen in human Alzheimer disease. Tau aggregates, including tangles, were present in the hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex of four animals that also showed β-amyloid pathology (14%).
