The brain noradrenergic system is critical for normal cognition and is affected at early stages in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here we reveal a previously unappreicated direct role of norepinephrine signaling in connecting amyloid β (Aβ) and tau, two key pathological components of AD pathogenesis. Our results show that Aβ oligomers bind to an allosteric site on α2A adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) to redirect norepinephrine-elicited signaling to glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activation and tau hyperphosphorylation. This norepinephrine-dependent mechanism sensitizes pathological GSK3β/tau activation in response to nanomolar accumulations of extracellular Aβ, which is 50–100 fold lower than the amount required to activate GSK3β by Aβ alone. The significance of our findings is supported by in vivo evidence in two mouse models, human tissue sample analysis and longitudinal clinical data=. Our study provides translational insights into mechanisms underlying Aβ proteotoxicity, which might have strong implications for the interpretation of Aβ clearance trial results and future drug design, and for understanding the selective vulnerability of noradrenergic neurons in AD.

One Sentence Summary:

Noradrenergic signaling sensitizes pathological GSK3β/tau activation to nanomolar Aβ


INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia affect nearly 50 million people globally, and there is currently no effective therapy to cure this devastating disease or to slow its progression. Strong genetic and experimental evidence indicates toxic amyloid β (Aβ) peptides as a key driving factor of AD pathogenesis (1–4). However, the failure of multiple clinical trials that directly target Aβ in the brain suggests that simply reducing Aβ burden does not necessarily result in alleviation of cognitive impairment (5). The microtubule-associated protein tau is an essential mediator of Aβ toxicity (6, 7). Hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau disrupts neuronal functions and plasticity, and spreading of tau pathology positively correlates with cognitive impairment in AD (8–10). Yet, the molecular pathway from Aβ to tau pathology remains elusive, presenting a major gap in in-depth understanding of the pathological cascade of AD.

Brain locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons are highly vulnerable in AD and degenerate at early stages of the disease (11–13). Noradrenergic degeneration often leads to compensatory changes (12–14) and enhanced responses to norepinephrine (NE) that likely underlie agitation, aggressive behaviors and sleep disturbance in early AD (14–16). Whereas the noradrenergic system is well-recognized as a sensitive target of Aβ and tau toxicity, our study reveals an unexpected direct etiological role of NE in AD pathogenesis. We report that Aβ oligomers at nanomolar concentrations hijack NE-elicited signaling through α2A adrenergic receptor (α2AAR) to activate GSK3β, resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation. GSK3β is a prominent tau kinase (17–20) and serves as an integral regulator in the development of AD pathophysiology and cognitive deficits (21–23). Thus, NE/α2AAR directly mediates Aβ toxic effects. This NE-dependent mechanism dramatically increases the response sensitivity of GSK3β/tau signaling to Aβ by nearly two orders of magnitude, and provides a possible role for NE in failures of clinical trials targeting Aβ clearance. Given the enriched expression of α2AAR in noradrenergic neurons, this mechanism may also render this neuronal population selectively vulnerable in AD. Our data obtained from human tissue samples and longitudinal clinical analysis, and two mouse models collectively support hyperactive noradrenergic signaling in AD as a critical element linking Aβ to the pathogenic GSK3β/tau cascade that ultimately leads to cognitive impairment.

RESULTS

α2AAR activity is elevated in AD patients and mouse models

α2AAR is broadly expressed in both noradrenergic and non-noradrenergic neurons in the brain and controls both norepinephrine input and its resulting responses (24, 25). As a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, α2AAR activates heterotrimeric G proteins to trigger signal transduction. Our pharmacological characterization of α2AAR in postmortem prefrontal cortex (Supplementary Table 1) revealed a significant increase (p&lt;0.01) in α2AAR activity [Emax/Bmax, reflecting maximum G protein activation in response to NE per receptor (26)] in AD cases compared to non-demented, low pathology control subjects (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, our analysis of cases from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database (Supplementary Table 2) revealed that usage of clonidine, an α2AAR activator, was associated with worsened cognitive function in patients with cognitive deficits whereas it had no effect in subjects with normal cognition (Fig. 1B). The adverse effect of clonidine was stronger in patients with more severe dementia (Fig. 1C). Combined, these data suggest that α2AAR signaling is hyperactive in AD patients, and activation of this receptor is detrimental to cognitive function.

We recapitulated the AD-related increase in α2AAR activity in mouse models. We first compared APP(Swe)/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice (27) and their age-matched non-transgenic littermates at 7.5 months of age, well after initiation of Aβ deposition. There was a leftward shift of the ex vivo NE dose-response curve that indicates enhanced efficiency of α2AAR-mediated G protein activation in the brains of APP/PS1 mice compared to their age-matched non-transgenic littermates (Fig. 1D). In addition, the α2AAR-elicited sedation response was potentiated in 7.5-month-old APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the increase in G protein activation efficiency by α2AAR indeed results in enhancement of in vivo α2AAR function in experimental AD. G protein activation by another Gi/o-coupled receptor, the adenosine A1 receptor, is not altered in APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 1F), suggesting specific enhancement of α2AAR activity in these mice. Similarly, we observed enhanced efficiency of α2AAR-mediated G protein activation in an independent AD mouse model, AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in (APP-KI) (28), at 7.5 months of age compared to age-matched wild type (WT) controls (fig. S1). There was no change in α2AAR density in transgenic or KI mice compared to their respective controls (fig. S2).

We found no difference in α2AAR-mediated G protein activation nor α2AAR density between APP/PS1 and non-transgenic mice at 5 weeks of age, prior to the development of Aβ-related pathology (fig. S3), suggesting that the change in α2AAR response efficiency in 7.5-month-old transgenic mice is likely attributed to Aβ accumulation in the brain. In support of this notion, addition of Aβ42 oligomers (AβO, 100nM, monomer equivalent, fig. S4), which are the primary toxic species in AD, sufficiently increased the efficiency of NE to induce G protein activation through α2AAR (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, Tris-based saline buffer (TBS) extracts from AD prefrontal cortex (AD-TBS extracts), which contain soluble Aβ oligomers (29), also increased the efficiency of α2AAR-mediated G protein activation (Fig. 1H, and fig. S5).

AβO acts as an allosteric ligand of α2AAR

The direct effect of AβO on α2AAR function motivated us to test whether AβO could bind to α2AAR directly. Flow cytometry assays showed binding of AβO, but not Aβ42 monomers, to cells expressing α2AAR (Fig. 2, A–C). Bound AβO was colocalized with α2AAR on the cell surface (Fig. 2D). Binding of AβO to immunopurified α2AAR showed a saturable curve with a dissociation constant (Kd) less than 30nM (monomer equivalent concentration of total Aβ42 peptide, Fig. 2E). We could not detect substantial binding of AβO to two other GPCRs, α2CAR (another α2AR subtype) and adenosine A1 receptor (Fig. 2F and fig. S6), demonstrating the specificity of the AβO-α2AAR interaction.

We next determined the nature of AβO binding to α2AAR. Our in silico docking result indicated that AβO likely binds to the third extracellular loop (3eL) of α2AAR (Fig. 2G). Indeed, alanine mutations of 9 amino acids (aa399–406) in the 3eL (3eL-9A) abolished AβO binding to the receptor (Fig. 2H, and fig. S7) without affecting binding of an orthosteric ligand, RX821002 (fig. S8). Conversely, a mutation at D113 of α2AAR (D113A) that eliminates binding of orthosteric ligands [(30), fig. S8] did not alter binding of AβO to α2AAR (Fig. 2H). These data demonstrate that AβO binds to an allosteric site of α2AAR involving the 3eL. Furthermore, NE enhanced the binding affinity of AβO to α2AAR in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 2I). These results, along with the fact shown above that AβO enhanced the potency of NE (reflecting its binding affinity to the receptor) to elicit α2AAR-mediated G protein activation, clearly demonstrate the reciprocal nature of the regulation between a GPCR orthosteric ligand (NE) and an allosteric ligand (AβO). Moreover, our data suggest that AβO actions can be sensitized by an endogenous neurotransmitter (NE). To examine the endogenous interaction between AβO and α2AAR, we crossbred the APP/PS1 line with the HA-tagged α2AAR knock-in line (α2AARHA/HA) that we generated previously (31) to acquire APP/PS1,α2AARHA/HA mice. Using these mice, we detected stable complex formation between the endogenous α2AAR and AβO in the brain (Fig. 2J).

AβO binding to α2AAR redirects receptor signaling to activate the GSK3β/tau cascade

Binding of an allosteric ligand to a GPCR often alters signaling through the same receptor (32, 33). We therefore searched for AβO-induced changes in α2AAR signaling using protein kinase arrays. Among the kinases tested, we found a change in GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 (indicating an increase in activity) (p&lt;0.05, Fig. 3A and fig. S9). In cultured primary neurons, we observed a significant reduction (p&lt;0.01) in GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 only in cells co-treated with AβO and NE, but not in cells treated with either agent alone (Fig. 3, B and C). When co-applied with clonidine, AβO sufficiently induced GSK3β dephosphorylation/activation at a concentration of 20nM (monomer equivalent, Fig. 3, B and D). This amount is less than 1% of the concentration required for GSK3β activation in neurons by AβO alone (34, 35). Furthermore, naturally secreted oligomeric Aβ at nanomolar concentrations (36) also induced GSK3β dephosphorylation/activation in neurons in the presence of clonidine (fig. S10). Concurrent with GSK3β activation in cells co-treated with NE and AβO, we observed a significant increase (p&lt;0.01) in tau hyperphosphorylation at AD-relevant sites, Ser202 and Thr205, detected by AT8 antibody (Fig. 3E, fig. S11, Fig. 4A and Fig. 4C). This change in tau could not be detected in cells where GSK3β expression was suppressed by siRNAs (Fig 3E and fig. S11), suggesting that GSK3β activation is required for tau hyperphosphorylation in response to NE and AβO co-treatment. Together, these data demonstrate that Aβ aberrantly redirects NE-induced α2AAR signaling to GSK3β activation and subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation. This NE/α2AAR-dependent pathway can increase the response sensitivity of GSK3β/tau signaling to Aβ by two orders of magnitude.

We further examined the role of endogenous α2AAR activation by NE in Aβ-induced GSK3β/tau signaling in vivo. AβO (100 pmol, monomer equivalent) or vehicle was microinjected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of WT C57BL/6 mice, which then received treatment with either saline, idazoxan (an α2AAR blocker), or lithium (a GSK3β blocker). AβO injection induced a decrease in GSK3β phosphorylation and a concurrent increase in tau hyperphosphorylation (detected by AT8 antibody) in dorsal hippocampi when compared to vehicle sham controls (Fig. 3, F–H). AβO-induced tau hyperphosphorylation was diminished by lithium treatment (Fig. 3, F and H), indicating an essential role of GSK3β in this process. When α2AAR was blocked by idazoxan, AβO-induced changes in GSK3β and tau were abolished (Fig. 3, F–H). These data suggest that endogenous α2AAR activation is required for Aβ-induced GSK3β/tau signaling in vivo, providing strong evidence for an essential role of noradrenergic signaling in Aβ-induced tau hyperphosphorylation.

To validate that AβO indeed acts through allosteric binding to α2AAR to activate the GSK3β/tau signaling, we performed experiments with cells expressing the 3eL-9A mutant α2AAR which cannot interact with AβO (Fig. 4A). Mutations in the 3eL did not affect binding of orthosteric ligands to α2AAR (Fig. S8), and this mutant receptor was still able to mediate G protein signaling in response to NE (Fig. 4D). However, in cells expressing the 3eL-9A mutant receptor, co-treatment with AβO and NE failed to alter either GSK3β or tau phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A–C). These data suggest that allosteric binding of AβO to the 3eL of α2AAR is required for activation of the pathogenic GSK3β/tau cascade. Collectively, our data reveal a previously unappreciated molecular mechanism, namely hijacking NE/α2AAR signaling, that enables nanomolar concentrations of extracellular Aβ to activate the pathogenic GSK3β/tau cascade, and that this pathway can be effectively blocked by α2AAR inhibitors (fig. S12).

Blockade of α2AAR reduces GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation, and ameliorates AD-related pathological and cognitive deficits

Our results reveal a NE/α2AAR-dependent mechanism connecting Aβ to the pathogenic GSK3β/tau cascade. We therefore hypothesized that blocking α2AAR in the presence of Aβ pathology would have therapeutic potential. To test this, we treated APP/PS1 mice with idazoxan for 8 weeks starting at 7.5–8 months of age when Aβ plaques were present and α2AAR activity was enhanced. Compared to saline treatment, idazoxan reversed hyperactivation of GSK3β in APP/PS1 mouse brains (Fig. 5, A and B), providing additional support for the critical role of α2AAR in mediating Aβ-induced GSK3β activation in vivo. In the cerebral cortex of idazoxan-treated APP/PS1 mice, the extent of Aβ load was lower than that in saline-treated mice (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating that blocking α2AAR slows the progression of Aβ pathology. This effect likely results both from the reduction in GSK3β activity, given that GSK3β can promote Aβ generation (37), and from regulation of Sorting-related receptor with A repeats (SorLA)-mediated APP trafficking, as we previously reported (38). Similarly, idazoxan treatment of APP-KI mice also reduced Aβ plaque load (fig. S13) and GSK3β activation (fig. S14) in the brain. We further examined another important feature of AD pathology, microglial activation (39). Idazoxan treatment decreasedthe density of Iba-1 positive microglial cells (Fig. 5, E and F), suggesting reduction of neuroinflammation.

In the cerebral cortex of APP/PS1 mice, we detected accumulations of pretangle phosphor-tau clusters (detected by AT8 antibody) in areas with Aβ accumulation (detected by an Aβ antibody) (Fig. 5G), and the intensity of AT8 staining positively correlated with the size of Aβ depositions (Fig. 5H), consistent with the idea that the Aβ plaque environment promotes pathological changes in tau (40). In idazoxan-treated APP/PS1 mice, the appearance and intensity of AT8-positive signals were markedly reduced compared to those in saline-treated littermates (Fig. 5, G–I). Furthermore, idazoxan treatment caused a significantly lower level (p&lt;0.01) of tau hyperphosphorylation induced by the same amount of Aβ deposition (Fig. 5, H and I), suggesting that blockade of α2AAR effectively alleviates Aβ-induced tau pathology. In APP-KI mice, idazoxan treatment also reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain (fig. S14).

Reduced Aβ pathology and tau hyperphosphorylation would result in enhanced preservation of cognitive function. Indeed, saline-treated APP/PS1 mice showed clear deficits in the Morris water maze task when compared to their age-matched non-transgenic littermate controls, whereas idazoxan-treated APP/PS1 mice were significantly improved (p&lt;0.01, Fig 6, A and B). Despite the presence of a substantial Aβ burden (Fig. 5C), idazoxan-treated APP/PS1 mice behaved similarly to their non-transgenic littermates on the last day of training (Fig. 6, A and B). Idazoxan treatment did not alter the baseline activity or anxiety (figs. S15 and S16). Cognitive changes in APP-KI mice were also mitigated by idazoxan treatment. Compared to age-matched WT controls, APP-KI mice showed reduced latency to the dark on day 2 in passive avoidance task (Fig. 6C), which was normalized by idazoxan treatment (Fig. 6D). These behavioral changes were not due to acute drug effects, but are interpreted as a result of the reduction in GSK3β/tau signaling by idazoxan treatment, since a one-week drug washout period was incorporated before testing the mice. These data collectively demonstrate that blocking NE signaling through α2AAR is an effective strategy to ameliorate pathological and cognitive deficits associated with Aβ.

DISCUSSION

Our current study provides strong evidence for an essential role of noradrenergic signaling in Aβ proteotoxicity. We show that AβO can hijack NE-elicited signaling through α2AAR to induce activation of the pathogenic GSK3β/tau cascade (fig. S12), resulting in tau hyperphosphorylation and accelerated cognitive decline. This NE/α2AAR-dependent mechanism allows AβO to induce GSK3β activation at a concentration as low as 1% of that required for GSK3β activation by AβO alone, and thus could be engaged in early stages of AD when Aβ concentrations are low. In fact, normal physiological concentrations of Aβ are in picomolar ranges (41, 42), and oligomers start to form when Aβ concentrations reach a critical aggregation concentration of 90 nM (43). At this concentration, AβO can sufficiently induce the pathogenic GSK3β/tau cascade through the mechanism identified here, providing a route for Aβ to initiate the disease process. We thus speculate that the noradrenergic system, α2AAR in particular, could play a critical role in establishing the Aβ-dependent tipping point at which hyperphosphorylation of tau accelerates. Interventions targeting this NE/α2AAR-dependent mechanism of Aβ action would be helpful in slowing or even halting the transition from normal physiology to the earliest stages of disease. Our study may also inform interpretation of failed clinical trials targeting Aβ. Considering that Aβ in human AD brains can reach micromolar concentrations (44), it would be difficult to reduce Aβ to below nanomolar concentrations in order to prevent activation of the α2AAR/GSK3β/tau cascade.

We show that α2AAR activity is enhanced in AD, which would further sensitize neurons to Aβ-induced tau pathology and cognitive dysfunction. This notion aligns with results reported here from unbiased epidemiological analysis of the NACC database and preclinical studies using two mouse models of experimental AD. Given that α2AAR is highly expressed in LC noradrenergic neurons, the Aβ/α2AAR/GSK3β/tau cascade also provides a possible mechanism for these neurons to be exquisitely vulnerable in AD.

Our preclinical studies demonstrate that pharmacologically blocking endogenous NE/α2AAR signaling can effectively reduce activation of the GSK3β/tau cascade, resulting in mitigation of behavioral deficits. α2AAR blockers such as idazoxan have been developed for use in other disorders, and repurposing these drugs could be a potentially effective, readily available strategy for AD treatment. In addition, our data suggest that the Aβ-α2AAR interaction represents an attractive disease-specific therapeutic target for AD, since the α2AAR/GSK3β/tau cascade can only be activated in the presence of Aβ oligomers. Directly targeting the Aβ-α2AAR interface would not interfere with normal α2AAR functions, and therefore be less likely to result in complications associated with an extended dosing period necessary for AD treatment. Furthermore, from a pharmacological perspective, simultaneously targeting both the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites would create a synergistic effect on receptor-mediated responses (45). Thus, the combined use of α2AAR blockers (targeting the orthosteric site) and drugs that reduce Aβ load (decreasing the allosteric binding of Aβ to α2AAR) may lead to an enhanced therapeutic effect.

We are aware of limitations of our study. Our analysis of the clonidine effect on cognition in human patients is not a controlled study and the sample size is relatively small. Nonetheless, our unbiased epidemiological analysis of the longitudinal clinical data supports the notion that chronic α2AAR activation exacerbates AD disease progression in human patients. It would also be useful to analyze the effect of α2AAR blockers in patients. Unfortunately, the sample size of subjects using other α2AAR agonists or antagonists in the NACC database is too small for statistical tests. Another limitation of the study is that a homology model of α2AAR was used in the in silico docking study, as the α2AAR crystal structure is not available. A precise view of the structural base of the Aβ-α2AAR interaction would be necessary for the design of compounds to disrupt the interaction interface.

In summary, our current study demonstrates that Aβ rewires norepinephrine signaling to induce activation of the pathogenic GSK3β/tau pathway, providing new insights into mechanisms underlying Aβ proteotoxicity, which have strong implications for the interpretation of Aβ clearance trial results and future drug design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design

The overall goal of our study is to address the potential role of the brain noradrenergic system in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. We focused on α2AAR, a key component of the noradrenergic system. We first examined the potential disease relevance of this receptor to AD using human tissue samples and longitudinal clinical data, and then recapitulated the AD-related increase in α2AAR activity in two independent AD mouse models. Next, we determined properties of amyloid β oligomer (AβO) binding to α2AAR using combined biochemical, cell biological, pharmacological and computational methods. We then investigated the biological consequence of the AβO-α2AAR interaction on intracellular signaling in neuronal cells and in the brain. Finally, we performed preclinical studies to explore the therapeutic potential of blocking α2AAR in ameliorating AD-related pathological and cognitive deficits. Throughout the study, we exploited an interdisciplinary approach, used multiple technical controls, and included both technical replicates and biological repeats in our assays. Littermate mice were randomly assigned to different treatment groups. Experimenters were blinded with phenotypes or treatments in animal studies. Sample sizes were determined based on previous experience with similar studies. The number of samples indicated in the figure legends reflects independent biological repeats. Conclusions were drawn based on careful statistical analyses.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. In general, Student’s t test was performed to determine differences between two groups, and one-way or two-way ANOVA was performed to determine variations in multiple groups with one or two variances. For Fig. 1A, age- and gender-matched control and AD samples were paired and analyzed in parallel, and paired t-test was performed to determine the difference between the two groups. For Fig. 1C, one-way ANOVA was performed, and for the rest of the panels in Fig. 1, two-way ANOVA was used. For Fig. 3, C, G and H, one-way ANOVA was performed and post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons were used to determine the difference between two groups. For Fig. 4, B and C, two-way ANOVA and post hoc Sidak’s multiple comparisons were performed. For Fig. 6, A, C and D, two-way ANOVA was performed and post hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons. For all statistical tests, p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Non-linear regression curve fit for saturation binding and dose-response curves was also performed using GraphPad Prism.
