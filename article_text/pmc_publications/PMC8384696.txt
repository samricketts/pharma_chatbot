Background:

Accumulation of iron is a consistent feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. The underlying cause, however, remains debatable.

Objective:

To explore whether local hepcidin synthesized by brain cells contributes to iron accumulation in AD brains.

Methods:

Brain tissue from the cingulate cortex of 33 cases of AD pre-assigned to Braak stage I–VI, 6 cases of non-dementia, and 15 cases of non-AD dementia were analyzed for transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR. Change in the expression of ferritin, ferroportin (Fpn), microglial activation marker Iba1, IL-6, and TGFβ2 was determined by western blotting. Total tissue iron was determined by colorimetry.

Results:

Significant transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin was observed in Braak stage III–VI relative to Braak stage I and II, non-AD dementia, and non-dementia samples. Ferritin was increased in Braak stage V, and a significant increase in tissue iron was evident in Braak stage III–VI. The expression of Iba1 and IL-6 was also increased in Braak stage III–VI relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia samples. Amyloid-β plaques were absent in most Braak stage I and II samples, and present in Braak stage III–VI samples with few exceptions.

Conclusion:

These observations suggest that upregulation of brain hepcidin is mediated by IL-6, a known transcriptional activator of hepcidin. The consequent downregulation of Fpn on neuronal and other cells results in accumulation of iron in AD brains. The increase in hepcidin is disease-specific, and increases with disease progression, implicating AD-specific pathology in the accumulation of iron.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common dementia of the elderly [1, 2], and its incidence is expected to increase as the world population ages. Though limited progress has been made, the development of effective treatment options poses significant challenges because of the multi-dimensional nature of this disorder. Neuropathologically, AD is mainly characterized by extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) and intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid deposits contain aggregated Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42, peptides released from the aberrant processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). NFTs are comprised of hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau), a microtubule stabilizing protein [3, 4]. Chronic neuroinflammation and glial cell activation accompany AD pathology and are partly mediated by neuronal death that follows the development of Aβ plaques and NFTs [5–7]. Accumulation of iron in the brain tissue accompanies these changes [8–10] and amplifies neuronal toxicity due to its redox-active nature since deferiprone, an iron chelator, improved AD pathology in mouse models [11]. The cause of iron accumulation, however, has remained unclear. Recent reports indicating local synthesis of hepcidin by astrocytes and other brain cells [12–14] raise the possibility that dysregulation of hepcidin synthesis may initiate neuronal iron accumulation, contributing to neuronal dysfunction and death.

Hepcidin is a peptide hormone secreted mostly by hepatocytes and maintains systemic iron within a narrow range by downregulating ferroportin (Fpn), the only known iron export protein. Secretion of hepcidin is mainly regulated by the iron saturation of serum transferrin (Tf-iron). Increase in Tf-Iron stimulates secretion of hepcidin, which limits uptake of additional iron and release of stored iron from macrophages by downregulating Fpn [15–17]. The opposite scenario occurs in iron deficiency. The brain is protected from fluctuations in serum iron by the blood-brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barriers, which allow regulated uptake of serum iron through specific receptors. Synthesis of local hepcidin by astrocytes probably helps in maintaining stringent regulation of iron in the brain in response to CSF Tf-iron [12–14, 18, 19]. However, hepcidin is also upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, in particular Interleukin (IL) IL-6, IL-1β, and transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 and β2. It is notable that the signal from cytokines supersedes that from Tf-iron and is partly responsible for the anemia of chronic inflammation [20–24]. A similar upregulation of astrocyte hepcidin by cytokines released from activated microglia is likely to increase intracellular iron in cells that express Fpn, on particular neuronal cells. Since CSF Tf is 95–100% saturated with iron [25] in contrast to 35–45% saturation of serum Tf, there is little buffering capacity for excess iron in the brain. Moreover, the high metabolic rate of neurons promotes the generation of toxic hydroxyl radical by Fenton chemistry, leaving these cells highly susceptible to toxicity.

To explore whether brain hepcidin contributes to iron accumulation in AD, we analyzed frozen brain tissue from Brodmann areas 24 and 32 of the anterior cingulate cortex. Of these, 14 cases were from Braak stage I and II, and 19 from Braak stage III–VI [26, 27]. Six cases of non-dementia from the same brain region were analyzed in parallel as controls. In addition, 15 cases of non-AD dementia, 4 from Brodmann area 7 and others from unknown brain region were analyzed. (Sample details are provided in Supplementary Table 1). We chose this option for two reasons. First, Braak staging is believed to correlate with cognitive decline and is a better marker of disease progression than Aβ plaque load [28], and second, microglial activation correlates spatially with p-tau aggregates and soluble oligomeric Aβ, an observation supported by in vivo imaging studies [29–32]. Two different parameters were analyzed: transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin with increasing Braak stage and its downstream effects and correlation of hepcidin upregulation with microglial activation and cytokine release.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethics statement

Human brain tissue from non-dementia, dementia, and AD cases segregated into Braak stages was obtained from Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Centre, University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank, and Mount Sinai NBTR Tissue Distribution sponsored by NIH NeuroBioBank. All experiments were performed in compliance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Sample details

We analyzed frozen tissue from 6 non-dementia, 15 dementia, and 33 cases of AD preassigned to Braak stage I−VI. Control and AD cases were of similar age and included samples from both males and females. Details are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

SDS-PAGE and western blotting

Western blotting was performed essentially as described [33–37]. Briefly, 10% brain homogenates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail), and equal amount of protein (30 μg) was fractionated by reducing SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with specific antibody. Reactive bands were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (34580, Thermofisher, USA) and visualized on an X-RAY film (JPI Healthcare Co., Ltd, USA) maintaining a fixed exposure time for non-dementia, dementia, and AD brains. Quantification of protein bands was performed by densitometry using UN-SCAN-IT gels (version6.1) software (Silk Scientific, USA) and ImageJ Software. Results were presented graphically using GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0) software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA) and Microsoft Excel. A complete list of primary antibodies is provided in Supplementary Table 2. HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse (NA931V) and anti-rabbit antibodies (NA934V) were obtained from GE Healthcare (supplied by Sigma Aldrich, USA).

Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg of frozen brain tissues with TRIzol® (15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as described [38], and RNA quality and concentration were assessed by Nano-drop 2000c (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA). Traces of genomic DNA were removed with DNAse, and the RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase Kit (18090200, Invitrogen, USA).

RT-qPCR was performed on a Biorad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (CFX96™Real-Time System). All analyses were carried out in triplicates, in 20 μL reaction containing 2 μL cDNA (100–200 ng) with BrightGreen 2X QPCR MasterMix (MasterMix-R) obtained from Applied Biological Materials Inc. (abm), USA and 10 μM of gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 3). Negative controls included cDNA samples without reverse transcriptase. Cycling conditions for all analyses consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and annealing at 60°C for 60 s. Melting curve analysis was performed by heating from 60°C to 95°C in increments of 0.3°C/s. Relative quantification (2−ΔΔCt) of dementia, non-dementia and AD (Braak I–VI) was conducted. The results were assessed and graphically presented using GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0) software (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).

RT-PCR was performed using InvitrogenTM PlatinumTM Taq DNA polymerase (10966–018, Invitrogen, USA) using specific primers (Supplementary Table 3). Samples from non-dementia, dementia, and Braak stage I–VI brain tissue were randomly selected and were run together on a 2% agarose gel. Specific bands were imaged using a Molecular Imager® Gel DocTM XR + (1708181, BIO-RAD, USA) keeping a fixed exposure time for all the samples. Quantification of amplified bands was performed by densitometry using UN-SCAN-IT gels (version6.1) software (Silk Scientific, USA).

Total iron in brain homogenates

A colorimetric method (Teco Diagnostics, Anaheim, CA) was used to estimate total iron in brain homogenates as described previously [33]. In short, 20 μl of 10% brain homogenate prepared in PBS was dissolved in 1 ml of acetate buffer containing 220 mM Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, pH 4.5, and 50 μl of 16.6 mM Ferrozine was added. The change in color was recorded at 560 nm after 10 min of incubation at 37°C using 500 mg/dl FeCl2 solution as standard. Negative controls were recorded without the addition of ferrozine and background was subtracted from test samples [33].

Statistical analysis

Quantification of bands from WB and RT-PCR was performed and presented as mean ± SEM of the indicated n. Level of significance was calculated using t-test or one-way ANOVA between the non-AD dementia, non-dementia, and AD Braak stage I and II and Braak stage III–VI brain groups.

Power analysis to estimate the sample size to detect a 0.3 minimal difference in experimental and control groups with 80% power and 95% confidence level of statistical testing was performed using the MGH Biostatistics Center calculator (Harvard University, http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/sample_size/js/js_associative_quant.html). Since we expect the experimental group to show greater variability than controls, we used a 3-fold spread in population standard deviations for the power analysis (0.05 versus 0.15). Based on these inputs, a sample size of 12 was recommended for a two tailed test. Since our hypothesis is directional, significance was calculated by one-tailed t-test, and our observed power is likely to be higher with fewer samples than 12 established by this analysis (using two-tailed 95%).

RESULTS

Transcription of hepcidin increases with disease progression in AD brain tissue

The increase in brain hepcidin in AD brain tissue was evaluated by quantifying relative expression of hepcidin mRNA in AD and control brain tissues by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR. Thus, total RNA was extracted from equal amount of brain tissue from non-AD dementia, Braak stage I and II, and Braak stage III–VI samples selected randomly, and mRNA for hepcidin was amplified by RT-qPCR using specific primers. Relative quantification of the change in hepcidin expression relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls was conducted using β-actin as the housekeeping gene. Surprisingly, hepcidin showed a 2.4-fold upregulation in Braak stage III–VI samples relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls (Fig. 1A). A significant increase in hepcidin from Braak stage I and II to Braak stage III–VI samples suggested an increase with disease progression.

To evaluate the relative distribution of hepcidin mRNA in Braak stage III–VI relative to Braak stage I and II and controls, RT-PCR was performed, and band intensity quantified by densitometry after normalization with GAPDH amplified in parallel. Samples from Braak stage III–VI and Braak stage I and II showed a wide distribution, suggesting variable upregulation of hepcidin within each Braak stage of AD. Non-AD dementia and non-dementia samples, on the other hand, displayed a tight distribution with little variability despite differences in the underlying cause of death, age, and sex. As in RT-qPCR, there was a significant increase in hepcidin expression in Braak stage III–VI relative to non-AD dementia controls. The difference between Braak stage III–VI and Braak stage I and II and non-dementia controls was substantial, but statistically insignificant (Fig. 1B).

The above results suggest that transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin is specific to AD and increases with disease progression.

Change in iron modulating proteins with disease progression in AD brain tissue

To evaluate the downstream effects of hepcidin upregulation, expression of Fpn was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting (WB) since Fpn is regulated at both the transcriptional and translational levels [39–41]. Amplification of Fpn mRNA with specific primers followed by quantification of band intensity by densitometry showed downregulation in Braak stage III–VI relative to Braak stage I and II and non-dementia samples. Distribution of individual cases showed decreased expression in the majority of Braak stage III–VI cases relative to a more spread-out pattern in Braak stage I and II and non-dementia cases (Fig. 2A). Expression at the protein level revealed decreased expression in Braak stage III–V samples relative to non-dementia controls of two different age groups (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8 versus 1–4, &amp; lanes 13–16 versus 9–12). Additional samples were analyzed similarly, and quantification by densitometry after normalization with β-actin showed a significant decrease in Fpn expression in Braak stage III–V relative to non-dementia controls (Fig. 2C).

Since Fpn is the only known iron export protein, its downregulation is expected to increase intracellular iron and upregulate ferritin, an iron storage protein. To determine whether this is indeed the case, brain lysates from Braak stage V and non-dementia controls were analyzed by WB. Probing for ferritin showed increased expression in Braak stage V relative to non-dementia samples (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8 versus 1–4). Bovine liver lysates were fractionated in parallel as a positive control (Fig. 3A, lane 9). Evaluation of additional samples followed by densitometric analysis after normalization with β-actin confirmed significant upregulation of ferritin in Braak stage V relative to non-dementia controls (Fig. 3B).

Since ferritin is an acute phase protein, it can be upregulated by other conditions besides accumulation of iron. To evaluate this possibility, the iron content of brain lysates was determined as described [33]. A 2.3-fold increase in brain iron was observed in Braak stage III–VI samples relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls of similar age and sex (Fig. 3C).

IL-6 is upregulated in AD brain tissue

To explore whether upregulation of hepcidin is due to transcriptional activation by cytokines, total mRNA extracted from non-dementia, non-AD dementia, Braak stage I and II, and Braak stage III–VI samples was amplified with IL-6-specific primers, and quantified by densitometry after normalization with GAPDH. A significant increase of IL-6 was noted in Braak stage I and II samples relative to non-dementia and non-AD dementia controls. Braak stage III–VI samples showed an increase in IL-6 mRNA relative to non-dementia and non-AD dementia samples, but it was statistically insignificant (Fig. 4A).

Evaluation of mature IL-6 protein by WB showed quite the opposite. There was an abrupt and significant increase in IL-6 in Braak stage III–VI relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–9 versus 4–6 &amp; 1–3). Increased expression of IL-6 in one sample of Braak stage I was reproducible and is not an artifact (Fig. 4B, lane 5). Quantification by densitometry after normalization with β-actin showed a significant increase in IL-6 in Braak stage III–VI relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia samples.

A similar evaluation of bioactive Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFβ2), another cytokine that triggers transcription of hepcidin, showed increased expression in Braak stage V brain lysates relative to non-dementia controls (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–6 and 10–13 versus 1–3 and 7–9). Evaluation of additional samples followed by densitometry after normalization with β-actin showed significant upregulation of TGFβ2 in Braak stage V relative to non-dementia controls (Fig. 5B).

Evaluation of the microglial activation marker Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule (Iba1) by WB showed a prominent band in brain lysates from Braak stage III–VI samples relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls (Fig. 5C, lanes 7–9 versus 4–6 &amp; 1–3). A positive reaction for Iba1 in lane 5 was observed in the same sample that reacted for IL-6 and is not an artifact. Quantification by densitometry after normalization with β-actin showed a significant increase in Iba1 in Braak stage III–VI samples relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia samples (Fig. 5D).

DISCUSSION

We report transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin in Braak stage III–VI AD brain tissue and its downstream effects on brain iron accumulation. As expected, the increase in hepcidin was followed by decreased expression of Fpn, upregulation of ferritin, and increase in total iron. The increase in IL-6 was noted in Braak stage III–VI AD brains and was accompanied by activated microglia and amyloid plaque deposition. It is therefore likely that the release of IL-6 from activated glial cells or transport from the periphery triggers transcriptional upregulation of hepcidin, leading to the cascade of events resulting in iron accumulation in AD brains. The presence of Aβ plaques, NFTs, and the degree of dementia largely correlate with one another [42]. Our observations add accumulation of brain iron as another variable that correlates with AD pathology.

A significant increase in the transcription of hepcidin in Braak stage III–VI brain tissue relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls is indicative of a response that is specific to AD and increases with disease progression. Differences in sex or age had no discernible effect. It is likely that upregulation of hepcidin is driven by IL-6, which is known to upregulate the transcription of hepcidin by the JAK/STAT pathway [43]. Other cytokines known to upregulate hepcidin through this pathway include IL-1β and TGFβ1 and β2. Though their level increased in Braak stage V samples, the increase in IL-6 was most striking. Microglial activation was also prominent in these samples, and so were deposits of Aβ. It is likely that Aβ-induced activation of microglia increased the synthesis and secretion of IL-6 in Braak stage III–VI, resulting in the upregulation of hepcidin. Accumulation of soluble tau and oligomeric Aβ in neurons has been reported to increase the synthesis and release of IL-6, activating and mobilizing the surrounding microglia [44]. Secretion of non-fibrillar p-tau from neurons has also been reported early in the course of AD [45–47], and could contribute to microglial activation and the release of cytokines including IL-6. Our data indicating transcriptional upregulation of IL-6 in Braak stage I and II is probably a reflection of this phenomenon. However, this increase is not sustained through Braak stage III–VI and is unlikely to have a significant effect on hepcidin synthesis which occurs mainly in Braak stage III–VI samples. It is likely that leakage of IL-6 from the periphery due to a breach in the BBB drives the increase in hepcidin observed in Braak stage III–VI samples.

The above scenario may also explain the specificity of hepcidin upregulation in AD brain tissue, and its increase with disease progression. Activation of microglia and release of IL-6 in response to accumulation of Aβ or p-tau in neurons could explain the disease-specificity and increase in IL-6-mediated release of hepcidin with disease progression. Extracellular amyloid plaques also appear to play a role, since the increase in microglial activation marker Iba1 and IL-6 coincided with accumulation of amyloid plaques in Braak stage III–VI AD brains. This correlation, though apparently strong, was not without exceptions since one Braak stage I sample from 11 examined had no plaques, and yet showed increased levels of IL-6, while another had abundant plaques but no increase in Iba1 or IL-6. Surprisingly, reactivity for Iba1 increased from Braak stage III–VI, while IL-6 levels decreased in the same samples, suggesting that other cytokines take over as the disease progresses. Whether IL-6 is transported to the brain from the periphery through a leaky BBB is unclear from our observations. Further studies are necessary to resolve this question.

Upregulation of hepcidin is expected to down-regulate Fpn on neighboring cells by its paracrine activity, blocking iron export and increase in intracellular iron. We observed no change in Fpn expression in Braak stage I and II samples relative to non-dementia controls, but a significant decrease in Braak stage III–VI samples, coinciding with the increase in hepcidin. Since neuronal cells express Fpn on their plasma membrane, hepcidin-mediated downregulation of Fpn is likely to increase neuronal iron, resulting in upregulation of ferritin as observed in Braak stage V samples. A significant increase in iron is also noted in Braak stage II–VI samples relative to Braak stage I and II and non-AD dementia controls. The increase in iron is likely to be compounded by reduced transport of AβPP, a protein known to stabilize Fpn on the plasma membrane, due to dysfunctional tau [48, 49]. Although upregulation of ferritin protects the neurons by storing iron in the relatively inert ferric form, the catalytic sites required for Fenton reaction are exposed in ferritin from AD brains, making it redox-active and neurotoxic [50]. Aβ peptides are also known to interact with ferritin and reduce ferric iron to the highly reactive ferrous form [51, 52], increasing the potential for iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Moreover, iron has an affinity for β-sheet rich Aβ peptides, and is known to accumulate in extracellular neuritic plaques [53], which were abundant in Braak stage III–VI AD brains.

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that brain hepcidin contributes to accumulation of iron in AD brain tissue. These observations are limited to the cingulate cortex, and though highly suggestive, fall short of proving that hepcidin secreted by astrocytes is sufficient in itself to alter brain iron. Neither is the role of IL-6 in upregulating hepcidin conclusive. Regardless of these limitations, our observations are provocative, and are likely to stimulate further studies on the functional role of hepcidin in the brain.

Fig. 6. Hepcidin-mediated accumulation of iron in AD brains. Accumulation of intracellular oligomeric soluble Aβ and p-tau and extracellular amyloid plaques (1) activates microglia, triggering the release of IL-6 (2). This leads to glial cell activation (3) and the release of additional IL-6 (4). IL-6 binds to its receptors on neurons (5), activating the JAK/STAT pathway (6) [18, 20, 21, 43] and transcriptional activation of hepcidin (7). Increased synthesis and secretion of hepcidin (8) results in downregulation of Fpn (9), accumulation of iron, and upregulation of ferritin (10) [54]. IL-6-mediated upregulation of hepcidin occurs in glial cells as well and is not limited to neurons as depicted here.
