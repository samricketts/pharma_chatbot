INTRODUCTION:

Sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD) is the leading type of dementia. Brain glucose hypometabolism, along with decreased O-GlcNAcylation levels, occurs before the onset of symptoms and correlates with pathogenesis. Heretofore, the mechanisms involved and the roles of O-GlcNAcylation in sAD pathology largely remain unknown due to a lack of human models of sAD.

METHODS:

Human cortical neurons were generated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and treated with glucose reduction media.

RESULTS:

We found a narrow window of glucose concentration that induces sAD-like phenotypes in PSC-derived neurons. With our model we reveal that dysregulated O-GlcNAc, in part through mitochondrial dysfunction, causes the onset of sAD-like changes. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting O-GlcNAcase in alleviating AD-like biochemical changes.

DISCUSSION:

Our results suggest that dysregulated O-GlcNAc might be a direct molecular link between hypometabolism and sAD-like alternations. Moreover, this model can be exploited to explore molecular processes and for drug development.

pmc1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegeneration. Due to its heterogeneity and complex pathobiology, the etiology of AD, especially sporadic AD (sAD), is not fully understood, and AD drug development has thus far largely failed 1. Indeed, owing to a lack of a human sAD model, current knowledge about disease mechanisms is driven by analyses of cellular and animal models, which replicate familial AD (fAD) and represent only a small fraction of AD cases 2. Thus, developing a human neuron model to study sAD may be helpful for elucidating molecular mechanisms of sAD and for identifying therapeutic targets for AD drugs.

sAD has multifactorial etiologies with apparent involvement of metabolic alterations in the brain, unlike fAD in which specific gene mutations have been identified 3,4. Evidence shows that detectable impairment of brain glucose metabolism occurs years before onset of AD symptoms and worsens with disease onset 5. The involved brain areas are concordant with neurological disabilities, and the cognition decline is more correlated with brain glucose hypometabolism than it is with aβ levels 6. Dysregulated glucose metabolism in AD may result from faulty glucose uptake and utilization due to brain insulin resistance and/or downregulation of brain glucose transporters 4,7. Another possibility is compromised cerebral perfusion by aging in the microvasculature that affects the optimal delivery of glucose and results in energy failure and mitochondrial dysfunction 8,9. Although the evidence that associates glucose hypometabolism and AD pathologies is compelling, the underlying molecular mechanisms causing sAD are still lacking.

O-GlcNAcylation is a regulatory post-translational modification involving the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue to specific serine/threonine residues on over nine thousand human nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial proteins. UDP-GlcNAc, the precursor to this addition, is produced through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) which integrates glucose, amino acid, fatty acid, and nucleotide metabolism. About 2-5% of all metabolized glucose goes through the HBP, providing a direct link to glucose flux and cellular O-GlcNAcylation levels 10. Therefore, O-GlcNAcylation serves as a nutrient sensing mechanism that couples metabolic status with cellular responses. Although the dynamic cycling of the modification is governed only by a single pair of enzymes, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), O-GlcNAcylation and its effects on protein function are in a context-dependent and cellular compartment-specific manner 11. Evidence from a multitude of laboratories support the hypothesis that dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation contributes to the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease 12,13. O-GlcNAcylation of brain proteins, including tau, is dramatically decreased in AD brain, and this reduction likely arises from impaired glucose metabolism 14. It is known that O-GlcNAcylation levels are lower in AD brains. However, how diminished O-GlcNAcylation directly affects mitochondrial and neuronal functions in the context of AD, and the molecular mechanisms leading to pathogenesis remain largely unknown, especially in human neuron models.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can be differentiated into several neural cell types, including neurons, allow modeling of the disease using neurons derived from both healthy donors and patients with AD 15. However, to-date, very few studies have used iPSC-derived neural cells to study sAD as a metabolic disease 16. Herein, we took advantage of iPSC and differentiation techniques to generate human cortical neurons from several healthy lines. The effects of glucose deficiency on neurodegenerative status and AD-like hallmarks were analyzed to study if PSC-derived neuronal models may provide a useful human model to study sAD. We found a narrow range of glucose concentration that induces neurodegeneration along with AD-like characteristics, including increasing p-tau and aβ levels. We further exploited the model to reveal the molecular roles of reduced O-GlcNAcylation in AD-like phenotypes. Together, we have established a human neuron model for studying sAD as a metabolic disease. This model could serve as a cellular tool to investigate mechanisms involved in the early stages of sAD and to screen for potential therapeutic targets.

2 METHODS

2.1 PSC cell lines and maintenance

Human iPSC lines K3 (Sex: male), a kind gift from Dr. Michael Tiemeyer, and iPSC lines C1 (Sex: female) as well as embryonic stem cell H9 (Sex: female), gifts from Dr. Nadja Zeltner, were previously derived and characterized 17,18 and were cultured as described previously 19.

2.2 Cortical neuron differentiation

Cortical neuron differentiation was carried out based on established protocols 20,21.

2.3 Quantification and statistical analysis

Data was collected from at least three independent experiments (biological replicates). The GraphPad Prism software was used for statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Student’s t-test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Dunnett’s test, Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or Šídák’s multiple comparisons test as indicated in figure legends. Data in graphs are expressed as mean values ± standard deviation of the mean (mean ± SD). Error bars represented denote the SD.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Lowering the glucose concentration to a critical level induces AD-like biochemical changes in human cortical neurons but not cerebellar neurons

To study sAD using human neuronal cells, we generated and characterized mixed cortical neurons from healthy human K3 iPSCs with no known genetic mutation associated with AD (Figure S1 and supplemental result). Given that compromised glucose uptake and metabolism, as well as limited glucose availability, may be involved in the initiation for sAD 22,23, we hypothesized that chronic and moderate glucose deficiency could induce AD pathologies. To address this question, we replaced neural maintenance media with glucose reduction media, which was adapted from neural maintenance media with lower glucose concentrations ranging from 0.5mM to 5mM, for different periods of time (Figure 1A). The medium was changed daily and glucose concentrations in media were monitored to ensure there were no glucose fluctuations exceeding 0.5mM (Figure S2). The effects of reducing glucose on the degenerative status of mature cortical neurons were screened by Fluoro-JADE C staining and cell viability assays (Figures 1B and 1C). Neurons maintained in neural maintenance media containing 25mM glucose were used as the control. Lowering glucose levels to 1 mM and 0.5 mM induced neuron degeneration within 6 hr and death within 72 hr, as revealed by Fluoro-Jade C staining and cell viability assays, respectively. On the other hand, neurons treated with glucose levels above 3 mM didn’t show any sign of degeneration or apoptosis. Interestingly, low glucose treatment at 2mM leads to dramatic increases in degenerative neurons after 2 days of treatment and decreased cell viability on day 7. These results suggest that neurodegeneration induced by 2mM glucose treatment might better represent the AD-like changes under chronic and moderate glucose deficiency as occurs in AD patient brains. Therefore, low glucose treatment at 2mM was used to induce neurodegeneration in the following study, while glucose concentration at 5mM served as the control instead of 25mM, which is a significant departure from physiological glucose concentrations.

To study whether low glucose-induced neurodegeneration is associated with AD-like characteristics and could potentially serve as a model to study sAD, two main AD-related changes, including tau phosphorylation and Aβ levels, were analyzed. Given that the highest percentage of degenerative neurons appeared on day 3 and 5 after low glucose treatment (2mM), neurons treated with glucose reduction medium were harvested at these time points. p-tau levels at several phosphorylated sites that are found to be involved in AD pathologies were measured by western blotting (Figure 1D). The tau phosphorylation levels of 2mM glucose treatment at day 3 were unchanged as compared to 5mM. However, they were significantly elevated on day 5, specifically on Thr181, Ser202, Thr231 and Ser404 (Figures 1D and 1E, Figure S3A). The increase of p-tau levels by 2mM glucose treatment lasted until day 7 of treatment and started fading on day 10 (Figure S4), which might be due to increased levels of RIPA-insoluble tau and Aβ fractions. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is accountable for its toxicity and aggregation to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and these types of tau are found to be accumulated in Alzheimer’s disease affected brains 24. Thus, immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect the deposition of hyperphosphorylated paired helical filament (PHF)-positive tau and NFT-positive tau using AT8 and NFT antibodies, respectively (Figures 1F and 1H). The percentage of AT8-positive neurons was increased to 13.3% (Figure 1F) and 10.5% for NFT-positive neurons (Figure 1H) by 2mM glucose treatment. Furthermore, NFT-positive neurons revealed a ballooned phenotype (Figure 1I) but not AT8-positive neurons (Figure 1G). The results may indicate that AT8-positive neurons and NFT-positive neurons are at different stages of tau pathology. Next, we accessed the effects of low glucose treatment on intraneuronal Aβ levels using MOAB-2 antibody which reacts with the N-terminal end of Aβ (amino acids 1-4). The major Aβ bands detected in our model that have molecular weights below 30 kDa were approximately 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 kDa, which correspond to trimers (or C99), tetramers, pentamers, hexamers, and heptamers, respectively, and thus are the ones we quantified. 2mM glucose significantly induced intraneuronal Aβ levels by 2.1-fold as compared to 5mM glucose on day 5 of treatment (Figure 1J and Figure S3B). The extracellular levels of different Aβ variants were further analyzed by multi-array electrochemiluminescence ELISA (Figure 1K). Lowering glucose to 2 mM increased both Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels without altering Aβ1-42 to Aβ1-40 ratio, which is more common in fAD 25. Interestingly, neurons maintained at constant high glucose (25mM) didn’t alter p-tau levels but induced higher Aβ levels in cortical neurons as compared to 5mM glucose treatment (Figures 1D–1E and 1J–1K). This observation is in line with previous studies that suggested hyperglycemia could increase APP and Aβ levels 26–28. Collectively, these data demonstrate that lowering glucose to 2mM could induce tau phosphorylation and Aβ levels in human cortical neurons.

To study if low glucose-induced AD-like biochemical changes could be reproduced in cortical neurons derived from other stem cell lines, cortical neurons were generated from two additional healthy human PSC lines, C1 iPSC and H9 embryonic stem cell (ESC). Both C1 iPSC and H9 ESC lines could be successfully induced to differentiate into cortical neurons, as confirmed by increased gene expression of neuronal markers and cortical lineage markers (Figure S5). 2mM glucose treatment induced p-tau as well as Aβ levels in cortical neurons derived from both C1 (Figure S6A) and H9 lines (Figure S6D). On top of that, increasing accumulation of AT8-positive tau and NFT-positive tau was also observed in 2mM glucose treated neurons (Figures S6B–S6C for C1 neurons &amp; Figures S6E–S6F for H9 neurons). Furthermore, AD affects brain regions and neuronal populations in a different and specific manner 29. The Cerebellum is well known to be relatively resistant to AD pathology, therefore, we tested our model on cerebellar neurons to investigate whether it recapitulates the predictable region-specific manner of AD. We generated cerebellar neurons from human PSCs based on established protocols 30 (Figure S7A). The identity of cerebellar neurons was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using the Purkinje cell marker, Calbindin, and granule cell marker, PAX6 (Figure S7B). The mixed cerebellar neurons were treated with either 5mM or 2mM glucose medium for 5 days, and the levels of p-tau and Aβ were detected by western blot. Interestingly, unlike in cortical neurons, low glucose treatment did not alter p-tau or Aβ levels in cerebellar neurons (Figure S6C). Taken together, our results demonstrate that glucose concentration around 2mM is a critical level to induce neurodegeneration and AD-like biochemical changes in cortical neurons, but not cerebellar neurons, derived from multiple cell lines.

3.2 Lowering the glucose concentration to a critical level alters neuronal structure and activities

In addition to p-tau and Aβ pathologies, neurite damage and loss of synapses are other key features observed in brains with sAD, and they are the major correlation with cognitive impairment 31. We asked whether neurite damage and synaptic loss could be recapitulated in our model. To evaluate the effects of lowering glucose concentration on neurites, we performed Tuj1 staining on cortical neurons treated with either 5mM glucose or 2mM low glucose medium for 5 days. The result showed that neurite coverage was dramatically decreased in low glucose-treated neurons, compared to 5mM glucose treated neurons (Figure 2A). Correspondingly, neurite fragmentation, a sign of neurodegeneration, was observed in 2mM treated neurons. The effects of low glucose on synapses were analyzed by western blotting, which showed synapsin-1 levels were reduced by low glucose treatment (Figure 2B and Figure S8). Consistent with the western blotting results, significant reduction of synaptic density was also observed by immunofluorescence staining in low glucose-treated neurons (Figure 2C). These results indicate that our current model could recapitulate key AD-like alternations, not only p-tau and Aβ but also neurite damage and synaptic loss.

Multiple studies have implicated altered neuronal functions in AD 32,33. Thus, we also assessed the effects of low glucose treatment on neuronal activities by multi-electrode array (MEA) assays. We were able to detect spontaneous firing spikes and bursts, which are indicators of neuron maturation in the differentiated cortical neurons prior to treatment, as well as neuronal network activity as indicated by the synchrony index (Figure S9). After being treated with different glucose concentrations, the neuronal activities were measured daily. Interestingly, we observed a decreased neuronal activity in 2mM low glucose treated neurons on day 2 followed by a gradual increase in activity which reached a 2.5-fold increase of mean firing rate as compared to neurons treated with 5mM glucose after day 5 (Figure 2D). The augmentation in mean firing rate by 2mM glucose treatment might indicate neuronal hyperexcitability, which is one of the neurodegeneration phenotypes and is reported in other in vitro and in vivo AD-like models as well as in patient brains during initial stages of sAD 34. In contrast, the synchrony index, which indicates synaptic function, was diminished along with altered neuronal activity by low glucose treatment and reached significant differences on day 7 (Figure 2E). These results together indicate that low glucose exposure could impair neuronal structure and functions in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. In summary, this system replicated the pathological features of AD, including p-tau accumulation, increased Aβ and compromised synaptic function, and could serve as a platform to explore the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in sAD, especially in early stages of sAD.

3.3 Dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation plays an important role in inducing AD-like phenotypes under low glucose treatment

Reduced O-GlcNAcylation levels have been observed in post-mortem brains of AD patients and are correlated with AD pathologies and progression 12,35. However, the molecular roles of O-GlcNAc in disease initiation and progression remain largely unclear. We employed our newly established model to answer these questions. We first investigated the O-GlcNAc levels at different time points after reducing glucose concentrations by western blotting using an antibody which specifically recognizes O-GlcNAc when attached to proteins. We found that O-GlcNAcylation levels were significantly diminished after 6 hours of low glucose treatment (Figure 3A and Figure S10A). Although the O-GlcNAc levels rebounded at 12 hours of low glucose treatment, the levels went down again significantly and maintained low levels until the end the experiment (Figure 3A and Figure S10A). In addition to O-GlcNAcylation levels, low glucose treatment also significantly raised the OGT to OGA ratio as compared to neurons in normal glucose media on day 5 of treatment, which might further indicate changes in O-GlcNAc homeostasis (Figure S11A). Moreover, the day 5 samples were further resolved by 2-dimentional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) which separates proteins based on charge in the first dimension and further by mass in the second dimension. The 2-DE was followed by detecting O-GlcNAc using anti-O-GlcNAc antibody (Figure 3B). While O-GlcNAc levels were globally decreased by low glucose treatment as shown by SDS-PAGE and western blotting (Figure 3A and Figure S10A), 2-DE provided more information that the O-GlcNAcylation on each spot was differentially regulated (Figure 3B).

Next, to validate the role of O-GlcNAc in low glucose-induced AD-like biochemical alternations, a potent and selective OGA inhibitor, Thiamet-G (TMG), was used to artificially raise O-GlcNAcylation levels in low glucose treated neurons. TMG treatment elevated O-GlcNAcylation levels in a dose-dependent manner and plateaued (around 4.5-fold increase as compared to vehicle) when used at concentrations above 1 µM (Figure 3C and Figure S10B). Additionally, OGT expression level and OGT/OGA ratio were decreased while OGA expression level was increased by TMG treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S11B). To go a step further, we asked whether increasing O-GlcNAcylation levels reverse low glucose-induced AD-like biochemical changes. Cortical neurons were treated with low glucose together with different concentrations of TMG, and p-tau and Aβ levels were detected by western blotting. We found that specifically raising O-GlcNAcylation levels by inhibition of OGA, even in low glucose treated neurons, rescued low glucose-induced AD-like biochemical changes (Figure 3D and Figure S10C). Among different concentrations, TMG treatment at 10 nM was most effective in rescuing low glucose-induced AD-like biochemical changes, while treating neurons with concentration above 10nM negated the beneficial effects. These data suggest the importance of precisely regulated O-GlcNAcylation levels in cortical neurons. The therapeutic effects of TMG on low glucose treated neurons were further supported by reduced AT8-positive tau (Figure 3E and Figure S12A) and NFT-positive tau (Figure 3F and Figure S12B) deposits, as well as by decreased extracellular Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels (Figure 3G). To further confirm that reduced O-GlcNAcylation is responsible for low glucose-induced AD-like changes observed in our model, a small molecule OGT inhibitor, OSMI-4, was used to lower O-GlcNAcylation levels in neurons. Cortical neurons were treated with normal glucose media (5mM) along with OSMI-4 at 20nM or 200nM, and the changes in p-Tau and Aβ were determined by western blotting (Figure S13). We found that 5 days of OSMI-4 treatment could induce both p-tau and Aβ levels concentration-dependently. Since other cellular pathways might also be responsive to glucose deficiency, we asked if there were any other cellular processes, such as AMPK and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, affected by low glucose treatment. The levels of AMPK activation and ER stress were measured in neurons under low glucose treatment after 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours (Figure S14). Interestingly, no noticeable increase was observed in neither AMPK nor ER stress levels, which was determined by phosphorylation levels of PERK and EIF2α, under glucose reduction. These results suggest that AMPK activation and ER stress might not be involved in the early stages of low glucose-induced AD-like alternations. To summarize, these results demonstrate for the first time in a human cortical neuron system that dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation, which serves as a nutrient sensor to regulate myriad cellular processes 10, is a molecular linkage between glucose deficiency and AD-like biochemical changes. Decreased O-GlcNAcylation on a large number of neuronal proteins might play critical roles in the initiation of AD-like alternations.

3.4 Mitochondrial anomalies are strongly correlated with decreased O-GlcNAcylation levels and precedes AD-like biochemical changes

Compelling evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play important roles in the progression of AD pathologies 35. In addition, O-GlcNAcylation has profound effects on mitochondria proteins involved in controlling many aspects of mitochondrial functions 36. Therefore, we asked whether dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation by low glucose treatment results in mitochondrial dysfunction and further contributes to AD-like biochemical changes. First, to elucidate if low glucose treatment affects mitochondrial O-GlcNAcylation levels, we separated mitochondria from cytosol and analyzed O-GlcNAc levels in both fractions by western blotting. We observed a substantial decrease in O-GlcNAcylation levels in not only cytosolic but also the mitochondrial fraction (Figure 4A and Figure S15A). Next, to evaluate the effects of low glucose treatment on mitochondrial health and function, membrane potential and oxidative stress were detected by JC-1 and CM-H2DCFDA staining, respectively. Low glucose treatment decreased mitochondrial membrane potential on day 1 and a more dramatic reduction after day 2 (Figure 4B). The diminished membrane potential was accompanied by increased oxidative stress started from day 2 after treatment and lasted till day 5 (Figure 4C). Both mitochondrial abnormalities could be rescued by elevating O-GlcNAcylation levels by 10nM TMG treatment (Figures 4B and 4D). These results indicate that reduced O-GlcNAcylation levels by low glucose treatment is strongly correlated with mitochondrial abnormalities and could be among the initial causes underlying AD. To assess key parameters of mitochondrial functions, we further employed a Seahorse XF cell mitochondrial stress test. Cortical neurons were treated with either 5mM or 2mM glucose medium and the mitochondrial functions were analyzed on day 2 and day 5 (Figures 4E–4G). The changes of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in response to different mitochondrial stress test compounds were measured (Figures 4E and F). We observed a remarkable decrease in both basal and ATP-linked respiration rates, which became more significant on day 5 of treatment, along with abated maximal and spare respiratory capacities on both day 2 and 5 of low glucose treatment (Figure 4G). The decrease in these indicators suggests damages to the respiratory chain which might further lead to bioenergetic exhaustion, predisposing neurons toward degeneration. Interestingly, TMG treatment at 10nM partially restored the low glucose-induced decreased mitochondrial functions on day 2 and exerted a further improvement on day 5 of treatment (Figure 4E–4G).

To further understand the interrelationship among dysregulated O-GlcNAc, compromised mitochondrial function and AD-like biochemical changes, several compounds that exhibit protective effects against different AD pathological features were investigated. J147 has neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration condition associated with aging by targeting ATP synthase 37. CHIR-99021 is a highly selective GSK-3β inhibitor that is reported to inhibit tau phosphorylation, while LY2886721, a β-secretase inhibitor, can lower Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid during clinical trials. The protective effects of these compounds were evaluated by the expression of p-tau, Aβ and synapsin-1. Cortical neurons were treated with low glucose along with TMG, J147, CHIR-99021 or LY2886721, and the AD hallmarks were detected using western blotting (Figure 4H and FigureS15B). TMG treatment significantly reduced both p-tau and Aβ levels and restored synapsin-1 levels under low glucose treatment (Figure 4H and FigureS15B). To our surprise, J147 treatment showed similar effects on Aβ and synapsin-1 levels to TMG treatment but failed to lower p-tau levels (Figure 4H and FigureS15B). CHIR-99021 and LY2886721 treatments profoundly diminished low glucose-induced p-tau and Aβ levels as expected, respectively (Figure 4H and FigureS15B). However, decreased p-tau levels by CHIR-99021 treatment did not reduce Aβ levels and vice versa. Correspondingly, the treatment of CHIR-99021 or LY2886721 failed to restore synapsin-1 levels. Together, these results demonstrate that low glucose-induced AD-like biochemical changes are partly attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction (Figure 4I). Mitochondrial dysfunctions seemed to increase Aβ levels and impair synapses, which is a hallmark of neurodegeneration, while decreased O-GlcNAcylation could increase tau phosphorylation independently of mitochondrial abnormalities. Interestingly, our results also suggest that the neurodegenerative phenotype, p-tau and Aβ could be observed in parallel without association with each other. To sum up, our model recapitulates different aspects of AD-like alternations which makes it a more attractive platform not only for studying the molecular mechanisms of AD but also for testing the therapeutic potential of compounds.

3.5 Artificially raising O-GlcNAcylation level alleviates the progression of low glucose-induced p-tau and Aβ

As we have shown the critical roles that O-GlcNAc plays in the initiation of sAD-like alternations (Figure 3), we wondered if raising O-GlcNAcylation after the development of AD-like changes could slow down progression and have therapeutic effects. To answer this question, different treatments were applied on cortical neurons treated with low glucose medium for 5 days (Figure 5A). After that, low glucose medium was either changed to 5mM or low glucose medium with TMG for additional 2 days. Neurons treated with 5mM glucose or 2mM glucose medium with or without simultaneous TMG treatment were also harvested for negative and positive controls. The beneficial effects of post-AD TMG treatment on alleviating AD-like biochemical changes, including p-tau and Aβ levels, were analyzed by western blotting (Figure 5B and Figure S16). P-tau levels were reduced by TMG treatment (2mM+TMG) and to a lesser extent by post-AD TMG treatment (2mM→TMG), while the abatement of p-tau levels by 2mM→5mM treatment is not obvious. The result was confirmed by AT8 and NFT staining, which showed post-AD TMG treatment (2mM→TMG) had a better effect on decreasing tau accumulation than 5mM glucose medium (2mM→5mM) (Figures 5C and Figure S17A for AT8, Figure 5D and Figure S17B for NFT). However, both 2mM→5mM and 2mM→TMG treatments failed to reduce Aβ levels, thus we asked if delayed TMG treatment altered Aβ deposition without altering its production. The deposition of Aβ plaques is one of the most important indicators of AD diagnosis, nevertheless, it is very difficult to observe extracellular Aβ aggregates in a two-dimensional in vitro culture system. Therefore, we exploited a three-dimensional culture system, in which cortical neurons were mixed with Matrigel to form a thin-layer three-dimensional gel, that allows the deposition and aggregation of Aβ peptides in the extracellular matrix 38 (Figure 5E). Using this culture model, we were able to evaluate the effects of low glucose treatment and TMG treatment on Aβ aggregates formation. We found that low glucose treatment resulted in an increase in both the number and size of Aβ aggregates as compared to 5mM glucose treatment (Figure 5F). Interestingly, the low glucose induced Aβ aggregates formation could be rescued by both simultaneous TMG (2mM+TMG) and post-AD TMG (2mM→TMG) treatments. Switching to 5mM medium (2mM→5mM) only slightly decreased Aβ aggregation number and size. These data demonstrate that simultaneous TMG treatment could stop the cascade leading to AD-like alternations at early stages, while with post-AD hallmarks, TMG treatment could slow down progression by alleviating tau phosphorylation and Aβ aggregate formation (Figure 5G). In summary, our results support the idea of using OGA inhibitors as a treatment for AD to slow down the progression and alleviate the symptoms.

4 DISCUSSION

Herein, we established a platform to study sAD using human iPSC-derived cortical neurons by glucose deficiency, mimicking limited glucose availability resulting from impaired brain glucose delivery, uptake and metabolism in aged individuals. The AD-like features, including tau phosphorylation, elevated Aβ levels, neurite and synaptic loss, and impaired neuronal function, were well recapitulated in this human neuronal model. We further demonstrated that glucose reduction dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation levels in neurons and thus hindered mitochondrial functions, which could be one of the early events of AD pathogenesis. Our results also support the notion that post-AD TMG treatment could have therapeutic effect on attenuating progression and could be a potential therapeutic strategy for sAD patients.

Neural cells generated from patient-derived iPSCs have been widely used in modeling both fAD and sAD, which provides valuable information of genetic factors in human AD pathogenesis 39. While iPSC-derived neural cells are perfect models to study genetic diseases, it is more challenging to model aging and metabolic diseases, since the reprogramming of iPSCs may erase aging-associated signatures 40. In this study, we established a model to study sAD as a metabolic disease by lowering glucose availability of human iPSC-derived cortical neurons, which mimics compromised glucose metabolism resulting from aging in AD brains. This model can also be applied to different types of neurons to study selective vulnerability and their unique molecular characteristics in AD. In addition to neurons, other types of cells in brain, such as astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes are also reported to play roles in AD pathogenesis 41. By using iPSCs derived neural cells and co-culture system, our current model provides a platform to study how glucose deficiency affects these cell types individually and collectively with neurons in contribution to AD pathogenesis.

The lack of sufficient glucose leading to neurodegeneration and neuronal loss has been reported in many studies. However, the vast majority of these studies focused on very low glucose or even glucose deprivation mimicking severe hypoglycemia or ischemic conditions in brain 42. Glucose concentrations that are very low (below 2mM) resulted in neuronal death within hours. Herein, we showed that chronic and moderate glucose insufficiency causes neurodegeneration together with AD-like biochemical changes in human cortical neurons (Figure 1 &amp; 2). To the best of our knowledge, we have provided the first evidence that glucose deficiency could directly induce AD-like alternations in human neurons. Our study is in line with previous findings that show glucose deprivation accelerating tau pathology and amyloid deposition in transgenic mice or rodent neurons carrying tau or APP mutations 43,44. Since our model uses cortical neurons derived from healthy donors without gene mutation associated with fAD, and since the AD-like changes were replicated only by limiting glucose availability, our approach is a more attractive model for studying sAD in human neurons.

O-GlcNAcylation levels are lower in postmortem brain samples from both sAD and fAD patients than ones from healthy subjects 45. In this study, we showed that lowered O-GlcNAcylation by glucose insufficiency is associated and preceded AD-like alternations in cortical neurons. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we further demonstrate differential regulation of O-GlcNAcylation on individual proteins under glucose deficiency (Figure 3B). These results suggest that dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation levels might play direct roles in AD pathology in many aspects. There are more than 20 O-GlcNAcylation sites on full-length tau protein. O-GlcNAcylation on these sites can compete reciprocally with phosphorylation on the same or neighboring residues 46. APP protein is also a target of O-GlcNAcylation which increase the non-amyloidogenic secretase processing of APP 47. Moreover, O-GlcNAcylation enhances the anti-amyloid chaperone activity of small heat shock proteins to inhibit the amyloid formation of both Aβ and α-synuclein 48. Finally, O-GlcNAcylation occurs on nearly 2000 proteins in the synapse alone, and synaptic development, cycling and receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane are all regulated by O-GlcNAcylation 49. Therefore, dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation likely hampers synaptic function and results in neurodegeneration. These findings support the notion that maintaining O-GlcNAcylation levels could exert neuroprotective effects against AD pathology. Together, our model provides a platform to study how dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation is involved in AD pathology, especially in the early stages, in human neurons. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of TMG treatment, which starts after the development of AD-like hallmarks, on alleviating progression of AD-like biochemical changes was also demonstrated in our model (Figure 5). These findings suggest not only that this model can serve as an AD drug screening tool but also that pharmacologically increasing O-GlcNAcylation may be beneficial to AD patients.

Declined mitochondrial functions, primarily as electron transfer and respiration, and increased oxidative stress are associated with aging and AD 50. In agreement with previous studies, we also showed mitochondrial defects precede low glucose-induced AD-like alternations (Figures 4B–4C and 4E–4G). These mitochondrial abnormalities likely arise from O-GlcNAc dysregulation and could be reversed by TMG treatment (Figures 4B, 4D and 4E–4G). It is noteworthy that O-GlcNAcylation is shown to be highly enriched on mitochondrial proteins and thus regulates many aspects of mitochondrial functions. Respiratory chain complex I, III, IV and V along with several components of oxidative phosphorylation are modified by O-GlcNAcylation suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation modulates electron transport chain activity and energy production 36. It has been found recently that the levels of various complexes are significantly decreased in various regions in AD brains in company with generally reduced activity 50. Moreover, mitochondrial and impaired mitochondrial axonal transport fragmentation observed in AD brains might also arise by dysregulated O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation can regulate mitochondrial fusion and fission by modifying DRP1 as well as mitochondrial axonal transport by controlling Milton 36,51. Accordingly, these mitochondrial abnormalities resulting from dysregulated O-GlcNAc are similar to those that are reported in AD brains and cell models, strongly suggesting the involvement of altered O-GlcNAcylation through, in part, mitochondrial dysfunction in AD pathogenesis.

As we demonstrated that TMG treatment at 10nM could restore mitochondrial respiration rates (Figure 4E–G), previous studies have shown conflicting outcomes. For example, short-term high-dose TMG treatment (2mM) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes has been reported to significantly increase basal oxygen consumption and ATP-linked oxygen consumption, while lowering reserve respiratory capacity, total cellular ATP levels and membrane potential 52. Prolonged and high TMG dosage (10 µM) treatment alters mitochondrial bioenergetic capacity and reduces NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response in neuroblastoma cells 53. Similarly, sustained high O-GlcNAcylation by TMG treatment in cytoplasmic hybrid cells, in which AD subject mitochondria were transferred to mtDNA-depleted SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, worsens the metabolic functions 54. Conversely, isolated cardiac mitochondria from rats with acute treatment of TMG possess higher mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates and ATP production rates. As O-GlcNAcylation and its effects on protein function are context-dependent 11, the controversial effects of TMG on mitochondrial functions could be a result of differences in cell type, dosage, and duration of treatment.

On the other hand, studies have reported that hyperglycemia could be associated with tau and Aβ pathology in vivo and in vitro 26–28,55. In our model, we also noticed that cortical neurons treated with constant high glucose concentration (25mM) had higher Aβ levels than the ones treated with 5mM (Figure 1J). In addition, treatment with TMG dosage above 10nM abolished its beneficial effects on reversing AD-like alternations (Figure 3D). On top of that, elevated O-GlcNAcylation levels by genetic or pharmacological means impair memory as well as learning function and accelerates aging 56,57. These results might suggest that high glucose, elevated O-GlcNAcylation levels and imbalanced OGT/OGA have adverse effects on neuronal health and functions. The bidirectional effects of O-GlcNAcylation might be partially through altering mitochondrial function, ROS production and proteome composition 58. Studies have reported that sustained alterations in O-GlcNAcylation either by genetic or pharmacological means could result in significant metabolic reprogramming and dysfunctions 54. These metabolic alternations in neurons might be the link between diabetes and neurodegeneration. Also, O-GlcNAcylation interacts with other nutrient-sensitive pathways and stress response pathways, such as AMPK and ER stress 59,60, which are also associated with neurodegenerative diseases and AD. Collectively, these studies again demonstrate the optimal O-GlcNAcylation levels and O-GlcNAc homeostasis are important for maintaining neuronal health and functions, while imbalanced OGT/OGA and O-GlcNAc are associated with pathogenic changes.

In conclusion, we showed for the first time that lowering glucose availability alone recapitulates AD-like hallmarks in human cortical neurons, supporting the notion that sAD is largely a metabolic disease. The phenotypes observed in this model are highly consistent with that observed in sAD patient neurons. Through this model, we support the hypothesis that glucose hypometabolism in brain could be a potential sAD cause directly producing the aberrations seen in both amyloid and tau. We hypothesize that abnormally reduced O-GlcNAcylation, which is caused by glucose deficiency, is directly involved in early stages of sAD pathogenesis and is a direct molecular link to impaired glucose metabolism and to the onset of AD pathology. Collectively, we demonstrated a human neuronal model, which could serve as a tool for better understanding the molecular mechanism of AD pathology, especially in the early stages of sAD, and this system could also be a powerful tool for drug screening.
