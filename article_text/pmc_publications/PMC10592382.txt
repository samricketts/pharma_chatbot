INTRODUCTION:

Neuronal health as a potential underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of exercise has been understudied in humans. Furthermore, there has been limited consideration of potential moderators (e.g., cardiovascular health) on the effects of exercise.

METHODS:

Clinically normal middle-aged and older adults completed a validated questionnaire about exercise engagement over a 10-year period (n=75; age 63±8 years). A composite estimate of neuronal injury was formulated that included cerebrospinal fluid-based measures of visinin-like protein-1, neurogranin, synaptosomal-associated protein 25, and neurofilament light chain. Cardiovascular risk was estimated using the Framingham Risk Score.

RESULTS:

Cross-sectional analyses showed that greater exercise engagement was associated with less neuronal injury in the group with lower cardiovascular risk (p=0.008), but not the group with higher cardiovascular risk (p=0.209).

DISCUSSION:

Cardiovascular risk is an important moderator to consider when examining the effects of exercise on cognitive and neural health, and may be relevant to personalized exercise recommendations.

pmc1. Background

Engaging in regular exercise and physical activity has been associated with reduced Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology (e.g., [1,2]), as well as higher brain structure integrity [3] and cognitive health [4]. However, the mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial effects of exercise on brain health are not well understood. One potential mechanism that has been less examined in humans is neuronal injury, beyond the context of AD biomarkers. While several validated biomarkers of neuronal injury have been identified in which higher levels of these biomarkers signify greater levels of neuronal injury, these have infrequently been examined in relation to physical activity or exercise.

Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) is a neuronal calcium sensor protein [5]. Neurogranin (Ng) is a post-synaptic protein involved in long-term potentiation via binding with calmodulin and subsequently regulating calcium/calmodulin-driven enzymatic activity [6]. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), a component of the SNARE complex, is involved in activity-dependent neurotransmitter release via synaptic vesicle fusion with the pre-synaptic membrane [7]. Finally, neurofilament light chain (NfL) represents a subunit of the neurofilament component of the cytoskeleton and is highly abundant in myelinated axons, as well as in soma and dendrites [8]. Elevated levels of these biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are associated with brain amyloidosis, hippocampal atrophy, and worse cognitive performance [9–17]. A few observational studies have found associations with exercise for SNAP-25 and NfL in plasma and brain tissue [18–20] while one study failed to find an association [21]. Another study did not find an effect of exercise training on CSF VILIP-1, NfL, or Ng [22]. Overall, there is limited data in the literature regarding the associations between exercise and these biomarkers of neuronal injury.

In addition to the relatively few published studies, there have been mixed findings in the observed effects of physical activity/exercise on biomarkers of neuronal injury, as well as significant heterogeneity in the studies with respect to AD pathology, cognitive functioning, and brain health effects [e.g., 1, 2, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Most of the studies examined individual biomarkers of neuronal injury rather than using a neuronal injury composite which might be more sensitive in detecting the effects of exercise. In addition, there is generally significant variability in response to exercise and a need for a more thorough examination of moderators that might influence the effect of exercise/physical activity on these outcomes [27]. One potential moderator is cardiovascular risk, which has not been extensively examined. There is some evidence that greater obesity can attenuate the benefit of physical activity on cognition [for review see 28]. Even within the very limited literature, most of these studies have used one cardiovascular risk factor (e.g., obesity), rather than a more comprehensive risk score. In addition, the prior literature has not directly examined whether cardiovascular risk factors moderate the association between exercise and biomarkers of a potential underlying mechanism of the effects of exercise, such as neuronal health. The goal of this study was to examine whether cardiovascular risk moderated the effect of exercise engagement on neuronal injury. We hypothesized that greater exercise engagement would be associated with less neuronal injury particularly for individuals with smaller cardiovascular risk.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants.

Older adults aged 46 to 79 years were enrolled from the Adult Children Study (ACS) at Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University. The ACS is a longitudinal study designed to develop and validate markers of AD pathology prior to the onset of clinical symptoms to identify individuals at higher risk of developing symptomatic AD [29]. ACS participants who are 65 years or older undergo an annual clinical assessment; those aged 45 to 64 years undergo a clinical assessment every 3 years. The Clinical Dementia Rating® (CDR®) was used to assess for dementia, and if present, to rate the severity of dementia symptoms [30]. All participants included in the present cross-sectional study were clinically normal (CDR=0) at the time of their assessment. CSF samples were collected within one year of physical exercise assessment (Mean=0.06, SD=0.44 years). Analyses between exercise engagement and brain structure, cognitive function, CSF-, and PET-estimates of AD biomarkers have been published previously [31, 32, 2, 23]. Participants underwent an informed consent process and signed consent was completed in accordance with Washington University Human Research Protection Office guidelines.

2.2 Neuronal injury.

Briefly, cerebrospinal fluid (20–30mL) was acquired by lumbar puncture at 8am after an overnight fasting period, as described previously [33]. Samples were gently inverted, centrifuged at low speed to pellet any cellular elements, and frozen at −80°C after aliquoting (0.5 mL) into polypropylene tubes. Prior to analysis, CSF samples were thawed on wet ice and vortexed briefly to mix. VILIP-1, SNAP-25, and Ng were measured via the microparticle-based immunoassay, Single Molecule Counting Erenna system (EMD Millipore, Bulrington MA) and employed antibodies developed in the laboratory of Dr. Jack Ladenson at Washington University [13]. NfL was measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from Uman Diagnostics (Umea, Sweden). CSF biomarker values were transformed with the natural logarithm to approximate normality, then standardized using the mean and standard deviation in the entire cohort. Use of composites have shown to increase the sensitivity for detecting the effects of interest over individual measures [e.g., 34]. Hence, the standardized values for VILIP-1, SNAP-25, Ng, and NfL were averaged to create a composite CSF measure of neuronal injury. Lower score on the composite and each of the individual biomarkers represents greater neuronal health.

2.3 Physical exercise.

History of engaging in a walking, running, and jogging formal or self-guided exercise program over the past 10 years was assessed with a reliable, validated questionnaire to estimate physical exercise [35]. The questionnaire was administered by telephone with participants reporting number of months per year, number of workouts per week, average number of miles per workout, and average time per mile for each year they engaged in a walking, running, or jogging program. By obtaining this information, the questionnaire accounts for both frequency and intensity of exercise. Since there were four questions per year, the number of questions can range from 0–40 depending on the number of years they endorsed engaging in the program. The questionnaire takes approximately 10 minutes to complete on average. Metabolic equivalent (MET) values were estimated using the compendium of physical activities to derive the physical exercise score [35–36]. The average MET-hours/week over each of the past 10 1-year assessment periods was used as the index of physical exercise.

2.4 Cardiovascular risk.

The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was calculated for each participant based on the previously published algorithm [37]. This algorithm includes age, body mass index, blood pressure, treatment of blood pressure, smoking history, and diagnosis of diabetes. The FRS primarily represents the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease [37] and thus represents one aspect of cardiovascular risk. Height and weight were measured with a Brecknell scale to calculate the body mass index. After at least 5 minutes of sitting, blood pressure was measured once while sitting using the ProBP 3400 device. A higher FRS score represented greater risk of future vascular incident. For the primary analyses, FRS incorporated history of smoking in the last 30 days while lifetime history of smoking was used for sensitivity analyses.

In order to have equal sample size between groups, participants were divided into low and high cardiovascular risk groups by a median split (FRS score of 14).

2.5 Statistical analyses.

In primary analyses using cross-sectional data, linear regression models done in R [38] examined the effect of the interaction between exercise engagement and cardiovascular risk on the CSF neuronal injury composite. Secondary analyses examined the effect of physical exercise and cardiovascular risk on each transformed and standardized CSF biomarker individually.

Notably, in the calculation of FRS, prior studies sometimes used the history of smoking in the last 30 days [e.g., 39], sometimes lifetime history of smoking [e.g., 40], and often it was not clearly defined [e.g., 41–42]. Hence, there is significant variability in the operationalization of smoking across the literature. Although smoking cessation significantly reduces risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality, there is some evidence to suggest that even lifetime history of smoking confers cardiovascular risk [e.g., 43–44]. Since there has been no systematic examination of the impact of smoking operationalization (e.g., past 30 days versus lifetime history) in FRS calculation on brain and cognitive outcomes, sensitivity analyses were done to examine the same models using lifetime history of smoking in the calculation of the FRS versus history of smoking in the last 30 days.

All models controlled for age, sex, years of education, APOE ε4 carrier status, and family history of AD dementia. Outliers were defined as values of the individual variables that were above 3.5 standard deviation. For exercise engagement, there was one outlier that was Winsorized (set at the highest value that was not an outlier) in order to maximize the sample size. For neuronal integrity variables, there was one outlier for NfL. This outlier was excluded for the calculation of the composite, which was then calculated based on other available variables. For the purposes of the secondary individual analyses, the NfL outlier was Winsorized. Results are described with the outliers handled. See Supplementary Tables for statistical output with outliers. All results were the same when examined with outliers.

Based on the suggestions by the reviewers, we conducted post-hoc analyses to examine whether the associations of cardiovascular risk, exercise engagement, and neuronal injury differed by age and/or sex. More specifically, we included the 3-way interaction in models predicting the CSF neuronal injury composite.

3. Results

3.1 Sample characteristics

See Table 1 for characteristics of the full sample, as well as low and high cardiovascular risk groups. The high cardiovascular risk group was significantly older than the low cardiovascular risk group. The groups did not differ based on sex distribution, years of education, APOE ε4 carrier status, family history, exercise engagement scores, or any of the outcomes.

3.2 Neuronal injury.

3.2.1 Primary analysis.

Cardiovascular risk significantly moderated the association between exercise engagement and CSF neuronal injury composite (interaction: p=0.008; Cohen’s f2=0.11, see Table 2). Greater exercise engagement was associated with lower CSF neuronal injury composite in the low cardiovascular risk group (β=−0.03, SE=0.01, CI (−0.06, −0.01), p=0.019; Cohen’s f2=0.16) but not in the high cardiovascular risk group (β=0.03, SE=0.02, CI (−0.02, 0.07), p=0.209; Cohen’s f2=0.02), see Figure 1.

3.2.2 Secondary analyses.

The same moderation effect of cardiovascular risk was observed for CSF Ng (p=0.039; Cohen’s f2=0.08; see Table 3 and Figure 2A). Greater exercise engagement was associated with lower Ng in the low cardiovascular risk group (β=−0.06, SE=0.02, CI (−0.11, −0.01), p=0.021; Cohen’s f2=0.18) but not in the high cardiovascular risk group (β=0.02, SE=0.03, CI (−0.05, 0.09), p=0.538; Cohen’s f2=0.01). For CSF VILIP-1, there was not an interaction between cardiovascular risk and exercise engagement (p=0.062; Cohen’s f2=0.07). However, greater exercise engagement was significantly associated with lower VILIP-1 across cardiovascular risk groups (p=0.045; Cohen’s f2 = 0.01), see Figure 2B. For CSF NfL, there was neither an interaction with cardiovascular risk (p=0.729; Cohen’s f2=0.002; see Table 3) nor a main effect of exercise (p=0.248; Cohen’s f2=0.01), see Figure 2C. Similarly for CSF SNAP-25, neither the cardiovascular risk interaction (p=0.166; Cohen’s f2=0.04; see Table 3), nor the main effect exercise was significant (p=0.250; Cohen’s f2=0.03; see Table 3), see Figure 2D.

3.2.3 Sensitivity analyses.

Sensitivity analyses were done to examine the same models but using lifetime history of smoking in the calculation of the FRS instead of history of smoking in the last 30 days. There was a trend for the same effect of cardiovascular risk moderation on the association between exercise engagement and the CSF neuronal injury composite (p=0.057; Cohen’s f2=0.06; see Table 4). Cardiovascular risk did not significantly moderate the association between exercise engagement and any of the individual markers (all p’s &gt; 0.194; see Table 5). In addition, there was no significant effects of exercise engagement on the CSF neuronal injury composite or the individual biomarkers (all p’s &gt; 0.087; see Table 5).

3.3 Post-hoc analyses

3.3.1 Interaction with age.

Age did not significantly interact with cardiovascular risk and exercise engagement in predicting the CSF neuronal injury composite (p=0.407; Cohen’s f2=0.01; see Supplementary Table 6).

3.3.2 Interaction with sex.

Sex significantly impacted the associations of cardiovascular risk and exercise engagement with the CSF neuronal injury composite (p=0.016; Cohen’s f2=0.10; see Supplementary Table 7). Cardiovascular risk moderated the association between exercise engagement and CSF neuronal injury composite in males (β=0.15, SE=0.05, CI (0.06 −0.26), p=0.003; Cohen’s f2=0.52) but not females (β=0.02, SE=0.02, CI (−0.03, 0.07), p=0.331; Cohen’s f2=0.03). In males, greater exercise engagement was associated with lower CSF neuronal injury composite in the low cardiovascular risk group (β=−0.11, SE=0.03, CI (−0.19 −0.03), p=0.011; Cohen’s f2=0.89) but not in the high cardiovascular risk group (β=0.06, SE=0.05, CI (−0.05, 0.17), p=0.232; Cohen’s f2=0.17).

4. Discussion

We examined whether cardiovascular risk influenced the degree to which exercise engagement was associated with neuronal injury. Our results indicated that greater exercise engagement was associated with less neuronal injury in the low cardiovascular risk group but not the high cardiovascular risk group. Thus, neuronal health likely represents a relevant underlying mechanism of the effects of exercise on cognitive and brain health. Furthermore, this finding also provides further support that increased risk of vascular disease can potentially attenuate the beneficial effects of exercising on cognitive [28] and brain health outcomes, as well as AD. While prior studies mostly focused on obesity as an indicator of cardiovascular risk, our study shows that this finding can be extended to a more comprehensive measure of cardiovascular risk, such as the FRS. Hence, failing to consider individual differences in cardiovascular risk may be one contributor to the heterogeneity in reported effects of exercise. A significant effect of exercise and physical activity on cognitive and brain outcomes, including AD pathology, might depend on the overall cardiovascular risk of the sample, indicating a need to clearly describe the characteristics of the sample, in addition to considering the interacting effect of exercise/physical activity with cardiovascular risk.

A similar, albeit smaller in magnitude, pattern of moderation by cardiovascular risk was observed when smoking history was defined in terms of lifetime smoking history rather than recent smoking. One possibility is that recent smoking history might be particularly salient in attenuating the potential beneficial effects of exercise on brain health. Thus, considering that there is variability in the operationalization of smoking history and detail provided in the literature [e.g., 39–42], these findings highlight the importance of detailed specifications of FRS calculations in the methods section. A future review or meta-analytic study that examines how the moderating effect of cardiovascular risk varies by the differing operationalizations of individual factors might be beneficial.

Our primary analyses focused on a composite of neuronal injury, whereas prior work has examined individual markers. When we examined each marker individually in secondary analyses, exercise engagement was associated with lower CSF Ng only in the low cardiovascular risk group, and exercise engagement was associated with lower levels of CSF VILIP-1 across cardiovascular risk groups. There were no associations of exercise with CSF NfL or CSF SNAP-25. This is in contrast with the limited prior observational work, which did find associations of physical activity with NfL measured in blood plasma in individuals without dementia [19–20] and SNAP-25 measured in brain tissue in clinically normal individuals and those with dementia [18]. In addition, an exercise intervention was not associated with change in CSF VILIP-1, NfL, or Ng measured via CSF in individuals with symptomatic AD [22]. These authors noted that one potential reason for the null effect was insufficient duration of the exercise training (i.e., 16 weeks). It is unclear whether markers of neuronal injury are more likely to be associated with exercise when a more sustained, regular exercise engagement behavior for 10 years is examined as in our study compared to a briefer period such as an exercise intervention. Overall, the discrepancy across studies might stem from differences in design (intervention versus observational), clinical status of the participants (i.e., clinically normal, subjective memory complaints, vs dementia), examination of exercise versus physical activity, operationalization of exercise/physical activity (self-report versus objective measures, i.e., actigraphy), and failure to consider important moderators.

Our results do suggest that the use of composites might provide a more robust estimate of the degree of neuronal injury, and thus show greater sensitivity to associations with exercise engagement and cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless, the markers of neuronal injury do represent different aspects of neuronal health and pathways. We observed exercise associations with VILIP-1 and Ng, which are proteins involved in calcium-mediated pathways. Animal work has suggested that peripheral calcium levels can increase following exercise and, subsequently, be transported to the brain [45, 46], while the results have been mixed in terms of observing decrease, increase, or any change in peripheral calcium levels following one bout of exercise in humans (for review see [47]). However, these are initial observations and future studies could consider that the individual neuronal injury markers might represent different mechanisms for the beneficial effects of physical activity and/or exercise on cognitive and neural health. Finally, we conducted post-hoc analyses to examine the impact of age and sex on these associations. While age did not influence the interaction between cardiovascular risk and exercise engagement, there were differences based on sex. The moderating effect of cardiovascular risk on the association between exercise engagement and neuronal injury was observed in males but not females. However, given the post-hoc nature of the analyses, these results should be interpreted with caution. This result does highlight sex as one potential moderator of the associations between cardiovascular risk, exercise, and brain outcomes. Future studies should aim to specify a priori hypotheses and examine this question more thoroughly.

One strength of the current study is the use of a comprehensive measure of cardiovascular risk, such as the FRS. In addition, we had measurement of several markers of neuronal injury allowing for the possibility to create a robust neuronal injury composite. This study also has several limitations. First, our sample size was relatively modest, although larger than the sample size of some prior studies [e.g., 20, 21]. Second, while we used a reliable and validated self-report, objective measures of exercise engagement, such as actigraphy and cardiorespiratory fitness, would be beneficial in future work. In addition, our estimate of exercise engagement focused on aerobic activities rather than other types (e.g., resistance training). Third, while FRS is a comprehensive measure of cardiovascular risk, additional objective measures, such as blood measures of CRP, HbA1c, lipids, etc. would be beneficial in improving the characterization of cardiovascular risk. Future studies should utilize larger sample size and examine whether greater duration, greater intensity, and/or different type of exercise might be necessary to observe association between exercise engagement and neuronal injury in individuals with higher cardiovascular risk. In addition, future research could examine whether cardiovascular risk might play a moderating effect in the associations between physical activity/exercise and cognitive functioning and AD biomarkers. Finally, another important line of work should examine other potential moderators of the effects of physical activity and exercise, such as genetic profile [48], diet [49], and sleep [50].

This is one of the first studies to directly examine and demonstrate that increased cardiovascular risk might attenuate the beneficial association between exercise and neuronal injury. These results provide some evidence that the degree of the beneficial effects of a given amount of exercise for AD pathology, brain, and cognitive health might depend on the individual’s vascular health. These findings provide novel insight into potential individual differences in responses to exercise and have important implications for tailoring recommendations for each individual.
