INTRODUCTION:

This pilot study aims to explore the psychometric properties of the Cognitive Function Instrument as a measure of subjective cognitive complaints and its performance in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal control (NC) in comparison to an objective cognitive screen (Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA).

METHODS:

194 community-dwelling non-demented older adults with racial/ethnic diversity was included. Unidimensionality and internal consistency of CFI were examined using factor analysis, Cronbach’s alpha, and McDonald’s Omega. Logistic regression models and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to examine the performance of CFI.

RESULTS:

The CFI demonstrated adequate internal consistency; however, the fit for a unidimensional model was suboptimal. The CFI distinguished MCI from NC alone or in combination with MoCA. ROC analysis showed comparable performance of the CFI and the MoCA.

DISCUSSION:

Our findings support the use of CFI as a brief and easy-to-use screen to detect MCI in culturally/linguistically diverse older adults.


pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a chronic progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and other important thinking skills, resulting in decrements in daily function [1]. AD has been reported as the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60–80% of dementia cases across the world [2]. While there is currently no cure for AD, medication intervention or cognitive training have been able to slow down the progression of the disease [3, 4]. As the AD pathology is suspected to start long before the onset of the disease, diagnosis of AD at earlier stages is of great clinical importance. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered to be a translational stage between normal aging and AD [5]. While it does not meet the clinical criteria for AD [6], individuals with MCI are more likely to develop AD [7]. Screening for MCI in older adults is important for identifying those who require a formal neuropsychological assessment and early management [8]. There is a need to develop an approach for the detection of MCI, with the hope that early intervention could delay or even prevent the onset of AD. Additionally, approaches that can be used to monitor ongoing cognitive changes can be used to evaluate prevention and treatment of AD.

Currently, the detection of diagnosis of MCI relies primarily on clinical evaluations [9]. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed as a cognitive screen for the detection of cognitive impairment [10]. It is one of the most commonly used cognitive screens in a variety of settings [11]. The MoCA is available in more than 60 languages and has been validated for use in older adults, particularly in the detection of MCI and AD [12, 13]. The screening tool correlates well with comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries [14, 15] and assesses most cognitive domains described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th Edition [16]. It also revealed high sensitivity to cognitive decline in longitudinal monitoring [17]. However, the MoCA has a limited ability to identify MCI in individuals with low intellectual function and/or limited educational attainment [18] because certain test items (e.g., visuoconstructional tasks) are biased by education [19, 20]. Performance on the MoCA also varies by age [21] and across different cultures and languages [12, 21]. Using the cutoff of &lt;26 can result in very high sensitivity but low specificity in detecting MCI in diverse, community-dwelling populations [21–23]. Other drawbacks of the MoCA are the length of time and availability of trained providers required for standardized administration (&gt;10 minutes) [18], scoring, and interpretation, resulting in a considerable cost for each administration. Because objective screening tools can be challenging to administer in busy medical settings and the cutoffs can be biased by education, age, native language, etc., MCI is significantly misdiagnosed in clinical practices [9, 24, 25]. Thus, a robust screening for cognitive impairment that is relatively free of cultural, linguistic, and educational bias can be advantageous due to easy administration and low-cost [26].

Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) refer to a self-reported experience of cognitive decline compared to previous levels [27]. SCC is a form of cognitive impairment and one of the earliest clinical manifestations of AD [27]. In clinical practice, cognitive evaluations of older adults with limited schooling and low acculturation often rely on SCC because of the educational, language, and cultural bias in formal cognitive testing. There is increasing interest in SCC as a marker for MCI/early AD. It is speculated that the predictive value of SCC will be higher and the predictive value of objective tests lower at earlier disease stages [28]. Emerging evidence shows that SCC can be used to identify older adults with MCI given its sensitivity to subtle changes in everyday function that cannot be captured in cognitive testing [29, 30]. SCC are associated with poorer performance on cognitive testing and longitudinal cognitive decline [31, 32]. There is growing data suggesting that older adults with SCC have an increased likelihood of biomarker abnormalities consistent with AD pathology, including cerebral amyloid pathology [26, 33] and cortical atrophy [34, 35]. The apolipoprotein ε4 gene (ApoE ε4), known as the strongest genetic risk for AD [36] has been associated with a greater prevalence of SCC [37, 38].

Although the relationship between SCC and objective cognitive impairment has been examined in numerous studies [32, 39–41], only a handful of studies have explored the utility of SCC as a screening tool or have compared measures of SCC with scores on objective cognitive screening tools in older adults. While some studies confirmed the association between SCC and poorer performances on objective cognitive screens, such as MMSE [42, 43], other studies found little or no association between SCC measures and objective cognitive screen [44]. In a recent cross-cultural study, only memory-specific SCC were associated with lower MoCA scores in Hispanics but not in African Americans [45]. These mixed findings could be explained by the fact that SCC can vary greatly in terms of content and severity [46, 47]. There is a considerable degree of variability regarding measures of SCC, and no single gold standard instrument or sufficiently validated cutoff on any scale has been established [29]. A more harmonized operationalization of SCC is needed to enhance comparability and generalizability across studies, settings, and ethnic/cultural groups [48]. Furthermore, most prior investigations on SCC were carried out exclusively on English speakers with limited racial/ethnic diversity. Since 2016, Chinese Americans and Hispanic Americans together account for 12% of the aging populations in the U.S [49]. Other than English, Spanish and Chinese are the two most spoken languages in the U.S [50]. Translation of the SCC measure for use as a quick, easily available, and inexpensive tool capable of detecting MCI in a culturally and linguistically diverse older population has significant impacts on research and clinical care. Additionally, many previous studies were conducted in clinical samples but fewer in community samples. Thus, it remains unclear how results might generalize to the larger population, as there may be linguistic and cultural differences in subjective reporting as it relates to risk for cognitive impairment.

A concise set of questions that serve to screen for MCI can be of significant value to determine if a further neuropsychological assessment is required. The cognitive function instrument (CFI) was developed by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) to capture change in participants’ cognitive function over the past year [51]. Unlike the commonly used objective screening tools, the CFI does not require an in-person interview or clinical judgement. The CFI is also easy to use and can be administered in 5 minutes. The CFI was found to be sensitive in tracking early changes of cognitive function in older adults without clinical impairment at baseline [52]. Greater reporting of CFI items was found to be associated with elevated amyloid levels in the brain [53]. The CFI demonstrated a similar effect size between Aβ groups as that of detailed neuropsychological testing in a recent study [54]. In the current study, we sought to build upon previous findings that SCC, measured by the CFI was associated with concurrent and longitudinal cognitive performance in older adults without dementia [51, 55] and aimed to examine the CFI’s utility as a potential screening tool for MCI. Specifically, using a cohort of racially/ethnically diverse older adults with linguistic diversity, we aimed to: (1) investigate the psychometric properties of CFI; (2) examine the use of CFI for differentiating MCI from normal control; and (3) compare its performance to MoCA.

Methods

Data Source

The current study utilized data from a cohort of older adults recruited to the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRC) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). Participants were recruited through mass media, community talks, word-of-mouth, and clinical services. Each participant completed a standard dementia evaluation, including the MoCA. Upon completion of the evaluation, participants were assigned a research diagnosis at clinical consensus conference using criterion developed at the ADRC at ISMMS based on accepted research criteria [7] for normal aging, MCI [56] and dementia [57]. The consensus conference was conducted by a geriatric psychiatrist and a neuropsychologist, during which diagnoses were assigned to participants after review of available medical and clinical information which did not include the CFI or MoCA scores. Blood samples were collected as part of the dementia evaluation for ApoE ε4 genotyping. Participants at Mount Sinai’s ADRC participated in the study using their preferred language (i.e., English, Spanish, Chinese). Clinical research coordinators were trained to follow a structured protocol for administration and were supervised by qualified clinicians to evaluate participants. In addition to the neuropsychological battery, the CFI was added to the local data collection effort in January 2019. Participants with a consensus diagnosis of NC or MCI who were administered CFI and MoCA within the same visit were included in the analyses.

Data collection was impacted by the pandemic of COVID-19 and some of the participants completed MoCA-Blind (described below) over telehealth visits. MoCA-Blind scores were prorated to allow for harmonization of the in-person and telehealth test administration mode. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Measures

SCC were measured by the CFI [51]. The instrument was derived from a standard clinical dementia assessment covering changes in cognitive and functional abilities over the previous year with yes/no/maybe as available responses to 14 questions. For questions about driving, handling finances, and work performance, an additional option of not applicable was available. Total scores on the instrument range from 0 to 14 (Yes=1, No=0, and Maybe=0.5), with higher scores indicating greater SCC. The CFI was translated to Spanish and Chinese following a protocol for multinational translation [58]. Forward and backward translations were performed by qualified professionals, and the final adjudication was made by expert reviewers to maximize the semantic/idiomatic and experiential/conceptual (the relevance and validity of the concept explored in the target culture) equivalence between the original and translated measures. Towards the end of 2020, the Mount Sinai ADRC revised the original CFI and split two compound questions into separate sub-items (i.e., item #6. Do you have more trouble a) recalling names, b) finding the right word, and c) completing sentences? item #14. Compared to one year ago, do you have more difficulty a) using household appliances, such as washing machine or microwave or b) electronic devices, such as computer or cell phone?). At the time of this study, approximately half of participants completed the revised version of the CFI. In an effort to maximize sample size and statistical power, the scores on the revised version of CFI were converted back to the 14-item scheme by using the highest value of the sub-questions of item #6 (i.e., 6a, 6b, 6c) and item #14 (i.e., 14a, 14b). Analyses of psychometric properties were performed with the original and the converted versions separately to ensure the comparability of the two versions before presenting results of the combined sample. Participants included in this study completed the CFI with a clinical research coordinator using their preferred language during their research visits. If missing values or “does not apply” responses were present, prorated total score was calculated using the formula (sum of item scores / number of valid items) * 14.

Objective cognitive performance was measured by MoCA, a commonly used performance-based screen to detect early cognitive changes [11]. The MoCA is a 30-point screening tool that evaluates aspects of attention, orientation, language, verbal memory, visuospatial, and executive function. Chinese and Spanish translation of the MoCA have been previously validated [59, 60]. The MOCA-Blind, which has been validated for screening MCI [61], do not require visual input and has a maximum possible score of 22. The MoCA-Blind was used for participants who completed tele-visits. Their scores were prorated using the formula (MoCA-Blind total score / 22) * 30.

ApoE exists as three major alleles: ε2, ε3, and ε4 [62]. ApoE ε4 genotype analysis were conducted using Qiagen kits and blood tubes. Participants were defined as ε 4 allele carriers (with one or two ε4 alleles) or non-carriers.

Known risk factors for dementia were included as covariates. These included age, gender, years of education, depressive symptoms [63] measured with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [64], cardiovascular risk factors [65], presence of sleep disorders [66], and ApoE ε4 [67].

Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using R [68]. Demographic variables of the participants (i.e., sex, age, education), language of the CFI measure, and relevant clinical variables (i.e., depression, cardiovascular risk factors, sleep disorder) were summarized. The two-sample t-test and Chi-square statistics from analyses of mean and categorical response categories, respectively, were used to compare demographic characteristics, clinical variables, the CFI and MoCA total scores between NC and MCI groups. Unidimensionality of the CFI was examined with factor analysis to support the use of a single total score. The ratio of the first to second eigenvalue was calculated as well as fit statistics such as the comparative fit index (recommended value of &gt;0.95) and the root means square error of approximation (recommended threshold of &lt;0.05). Internal consistency was examined with Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega [69]. Correlations among the variables examined for inclusion in multivariate models were estimated using the Spearman rank method. Logistic regression models and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (R package pROC) [70] were used to examine the utility of CFI as a screen to detect MCI and to compare its performance with MoCA.

Results

Sample Characterization

The sample used for Aim 1 and 2 included 194 adults (NC = 156, MCI = 38) aged between 56 and 95 years (M = 74.7, SD = 7.9), with a mean of 15.2 years of education (SD = 3.39); 60.8% of the sample identified as female; 38.1% of the sample identified as White, followed by Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic, and Other; 64.9% of the participants completed the evaluation in English, 29.9% in Chinese, and 5.2% in Spanish. See Table 1. 95.9% of the participants completed the CFI scale without missing items (excluding “Does Not Apply” responses). The completion rates in English-speaking, Chinese-speaking, and Spanish-speaking subsamples were 93.7%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Chinese-speaking and Spanish-speaking participants endorsed higher level of symptomology on most of the CFI items, resulting in significantly higher total scores of CFI compared to the English-speaking participants (F = 12.31, p &lt; .001; Supplemental Table 1). 38.1% of the participants completed in-person MoCA. Prorated MoCA score was statistically comparable between those who completed in-person MoCA and those who completed MoCA-blind (t = −0.52, p = 0.60). NC and MCI groups were statistically comparable in age, gender, education level, racial/ethnic composition, proportion of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, sleep apnea, hyposomnia, and CFI language. The MCI group scored significantly higher on the GDS (greater depressive symptoms) and CFI (greater cognitive complaints) while significantly lower on the prorated MoCA (poorer cognitive performance) (Table 1). 82.0% of the participants completed CFI and MoCA within 3 months (M=67.4 days, SD=125.1 days).

Aim 1. Psychometric Properties of CFI

To support the use of a single total score of CFI, unidimensionality of CFI was assessed with principal component analysis (PCA). PCA revealed a ratio of 2.52 between the first two components which is below the commonly used cutoff of 4. Exploratory factor analysis with a one-factor solution showed reasonable model fit statistics (comparative fit index of 0.92, just under the recommended threshold, and RMSEA of 0.06, slightly above the recommended threshold; Table 2). Overall internal consistency reliability of CFI as measured by the Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega was acceptable (standardized α = 0.85, ω total = 0.85). These analyses were replicated in subgroups of participants who completed the original versus the converted version of the CFI and the results were found to be similar (Supplemental Table 2). On the item level, one item (item #9, are you less involved in social activities?) demonstrated a relatively lower corrected item-total correlation (correlation of the item with the sum score after removal of the item from the sum) (r = 0.29). The overall internal consistency of CFI would increase slightly if item 9 was dropped (Table 3). Additionally, item #7 (trouble driving) and item #10 (trouble with work performance) evidenced high percentages of ‘Does Not Apply’ responses (49.0% and 55.2%, respectively).

Aim 2. Distinguishing participants with MCI from NC using CFI

The correlation matrix (Table 4) of all independent and dependent variables showed that gender, geriatric depression scale, sleep apnea, CFI and MoCA were significantly related to the dependent factor of diagnosis at the p=0.1 level. Other demographic variables including age, education, and language, clinical variables, and ApoE ε4 were not significantly related to the dependent variable even at a significance level of 0.1, and therefore, were not entered in the regression analyses.

The CFI total score was used to distinguish MCI from NC using logistic regression and ROC analyses. A logistic regression model applied to the sample of 194 participants demonstrated that the CFI total score was a significant, unique predictor of MCI diagnosis (b=−0.25, p&lt;0.001) when gender, GDS score, and presence of sleep apnea were controlled (Table 5). In ROC analyses, we demonstrated that CFI produced acceptable AUC statistics of 0.73.

Aim 3. Distinguishing MCI from NC using CFI and MoCA

The likelihood ratio test of the two models indicated that MoCA alone is a better predictor of MCI than CFI alone (x2 = 10.41, p &lt;0.001). When CFI and MoCA were entered simultaneously, both were found to be significant predictors (Table 5). Not surprisingly, the model containing both CFI and MoCA had significantly stronger model fit than the models containing MoCA (x2 = 4.24, p =0.04) or CFI alone (x2 = 14.65, p &lt;0.001).

ROC analyses of MoCA revealed an AUC of 0.76, which is statistically comparable to the AUC of CFI (0.73, Table 6 and Figure 1). With estimated optimal cutoff scores of 3.5 and 24.5, respectively, CFI and MoCA demonstrated similar values of sensitivity and specificity (Table 6). Positive predictive value of both measures in the current sample were relatively low (0.34), highlighting that these measures are meant to be used as screeners as opposed to confirmative diagnostic tools.

Discussion

Comprehensive neurocognitive evaluations to detect MCI are expensive, time-consuming, and not always readily accessible to older adults, particularly racial/ethnic minorities. There is a need to develop low-cost, brief, and easily available instruments to screen for MCI in diverse older populations. Translation of cognitive tests has been empirically validated for detecting cognitive deficits in older adults across cultural and linguistic backgrounds [71]. Yet, translation of SCC measures to flag for potential cognitive impairment are understudied. SCC are often used in clinical practice, especially among older adults against whom traditional objective cognitive tests have been found to be biased [72]. This study examined the psychometric properties of CFI, a simple, easy-to-use cognitive tool measuring SCC, and its performance to distinguish MCI from normal cognition in a sample of racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse older adults without dementia. We found that SCC were reported in both cognitively normal and MCI groups, with significantly higher CFI scores in the MCI group than the cognitively normal group. The result is consistent with Petersen’s diagnostic criteria, which defines MCI as the presence of both subjective and objective cognitive impairments [7, 56]. We also found that cognitive complaints were endorsed at a higher rate by Chinese- and Spanish-speaking older adults compared to their English-speaking peers; however, small subgroup sample sizes preclude formal statistical analyses of the observed differences.

The CFI was completed by over 95% of the participants in the current study (100% in Chinese- and Spanish-speaking subgroups), suggesting its feasibility and practicality as a clinical tool. Results of the principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis showed that the ratio of the first to second eigenvalue and the amount of variance explained was suboptimal; however, the fit indices for the one-factor model of CFI were close to recommended thresholds. This result is likely related to a relatively small sample size (and resulting relatively low item prevalence) that does not support a stable model fit assessment [73]. In addition, we identified a few items with either high rates of inapplicable responses or lower corrected item-total correlations. Unfortunately, in this preliminary study, we were not able to investigate the factor structure and reliability in each language subgroup due to the sample size limitations. The overall higher level of symptom endorsement in the non-English speaking subgroups may suggest that SCC manifests differently for individuals with different cultural background. However, this conclusion is speculative, given the small subgroup sample sizes and thus requires continued culturally informed investigation. Despite the somewhat less than optimal psychometric performance, our preliminary results showed that CFI was relatively accurate for detecting cognitive impairment at the very early stage. Specifically, the use of CFI alone was able to distinguish MCI from the normal controls while controlling for confounding factors including sex, sleep apnea, and depression. It should be noted that the role of depression in the relation between SCC and objective cognitive impairment has long been investigated yet remains inconclusive. However, a recent meta-analysis [74] found that SCC tends to be independently associated with both objective cognitive function and depressive symptoms when measured by comprehensive measures rather than single-item questions, which is consistent with our finding of SCC’s predictive role of diagnosis independent of depression symptomology. Using ROC analysis, we obtained statistics demonstrating CFI’s performance as a screener, including its sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with an optimal cut point estimate (≥3.5). However, caution is advised with the use of CFI with individuals with more advanced cognitive impairment and dementia because the accuracy of self-reported SCC is lower at later stages in the disease process due to declined insights. The informant version of the CFI may be clinically valuable in this situation, but we were unable to validate the informant version in this current study. Of note, in contrast to some reports [72], for this sample, ApoE ε4 was not associated with the diagnosis of MCI. These results highlight the heterogeneity of MCI in older adults, and limited clinical applicability of ApoE for detecting MCI. Further research with larger cross-validation samples is needed.

Additionally, this study compared the CFI to the MoCA as a screening tool for MCI in older adults. Our findings suggest that the CFI and MoCA have comparable performance for detecting MCI in a diverse cohort of community-dwelling older adults with significant medical comorbidity. In fact, the performance of these two measures on the ROC analyses was quite similar. Several advantages of the use of SCC measures such as the CFI are noted. The CFI can be self-administrated, thus eliminating the time-consuming need for testing provided by health care practitioners while also increasing the availability of cognitive screening. Additionally, the measure is brief, easily accessible, and suitable for routine clinical practice and for large clinical studies of cognitive outcome. Finally, CFI and objective cognitive assessments as reflected in the MoCA may measure different aspects of cognitive function and thus can be complementary to each other to improve screening efficiency. It must be emphasized that the CFI and MoCA are both designed to be screening measures and cannot substitute for expert clinical evaluation. A diagnosis of MCI cannot be based solely on a brief self-report instrument, but CFI appears to be effective for identifying individuals who might benefit from further diagnostic assessment.

Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size. Factor structure analyses were limited, and logistic regression power is affected by the number and types of covariates. Thus, validation with a larger sample is recommended. In addition, the sample on average was highly educated (15 years) and predominantly native-English speaking (69%). It may be useful in research studies to enrich study samples with a higher rate of minority group members. Additionally, given the imbalanced language composition, and relatively low subgroup sample sizes, this study was unable to establish measurement equivalence in different language versions of the CFI or to compare screening performance in each language-based subgroup. We plan to continue collecting data to perform meaningful comparison of psychometric properties of the English original version with the translated versions to better serve the non-English speaking populations. Furthermore, we established a cut-off score estimate for the CFI that captures complaints specific to older adults with normal cognition and MCI. SCC measures likely incorporate detection of true cognitive decline, but is limited in its usage to speculate etiology and is subject to the effects of confounding physical, psychological, and mood factors, all of which are critical to investigate through clinical evaluation. Lastly, we were unable to investigate informant reported cognitive decline in this cohort, which can be clinically meaningful given the diminished insights in some neurodegenerative diseases and the family involvement often seen in non-English speaking individuals. Future research may consider collecting information for both self-report and informant-report CFI and explore their potential clinical utilities.

Conclusion

There is a need to develop a simple, easy to use, and sensitive tool for detection of MCI in older adults. The CFI, a measure of SCC, might be one such tool. Here, the CFI evidenced acceptable internal consistency, and has practical utility for use with a racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse cohort of older adults without dementia. Specifically, we have preliminary data to support that CFI may be used to distinguish MCI from NC in older adults of varying cultural and language backgrounds, and its performance is comparable to that of a cognitive screening instrument for cognitive impairment. We emphasize that these cognitive screeners are limited by their relatively low positive predictive value and should not be used as substitute for expert clinical evaluations. Given the relatively small sample size and the research setting, the results may not be generalizable to a larger population in primary care settings. Continued testing and test-retest reliability analysis in a larger sample that is more representative of the intended setting of use is needed to examine further the validity and screening accuracy of the measure.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review:

The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (eg, PubMed) sources. Subjective cognitive complaint (SCC) may indicate an early risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and may function as a low-cost, efficient screening tool to identify older adults who need further evaluation. Although prior reports have suggested an association between SCC and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, known as the early stage of AD), research on the sensitivity and specificity of using SCC measures for the detection of MCI in older adults across racial/ethnic groups is lacking. We reviewed the literature on the evidence supporting SCC’s prediction value of dementia as well as the association between SCC and AD pathology. These relevant citations are appropriately cited.

Interpretation:

Findings suggest that CFI, a 14-item measure of SCC, can be a useful tool for differentiating MCI and NC in an older sample with linguistical and cultural diversity. The specificity and sensitivity of the CFI are comparable to those of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA, an objective cognitive screening tool).

Future directions:

Future research should determine the validity and reliability using a larger sample to examine further the diagnostic accuracy of the measure.

Highlight

What is the key scientific question or problem of central interest of the paper?

Subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) are considered the earliest sign of dementia in older adults. However, it is unclear if SCC are equivalent in different cultures. Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) is a 14-item measure of SCC. This study provides pilot data suggesting that CFI is sensitive for detecting mild cognitive impairment in a cohort of older adults with racial/ethnic diversity. In comparing performance, CFI demonstrates comparable sensitivity to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, an objective cognitive screening test. Overall, SCC may provide a non-invasive, easy to use method to flag for possible cognitive impairment in both research and clinical settings.

The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.
