Fractionating performance of a verbal list-learning test can provide a nuanced interpretation of the relationship between brain networks and learning and memory abilities. Within older adult samples, including those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, cortical volumes for attention and executive functioning networks correlate more strongly with neuropsychological performance measures of early learning trials relative to late learning and delayed recall. In contrast, medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures, such as the hippocampus, are more strongly correlated to performance on late learning and delayed recall measures relative to early learning. We sought to extend these findings by evaluating the contributions of simple attention, executive function (EF), and MTL structures to learning and recall in a cognitively heterogeneous sample of older adults that included healthy controls (n = 54), adults with MCI (n = 63), and those with dementia (n = 13). We used canonical correlation analyses to test the hypotheses that the contributions of EF, simple attention, and the MTL to verbal memory would differ across phases of learning and recall. Results showed that relationships between the MTL and memory were the only ones to demonstrate a graded pattern of association, ranging from r = .46 to .57 across early learning, late learning, and delayed recall. Simple attention and EF were both significantly and moderately related to learning and recall, but those relationships did not vary across phases as hypothesized. We explore alternative interpretations for our discrepant findings, including the influence of sample characteristics and methodology, advocating for multivariate approaches.

pmcDisruptions to learning and memory processes are common within neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Within older adult samples, declines in verbal episodic memory are a sensitive symptom of pathological aging, specifically Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Weissberger et al., 2017). Within the most common AD presentation, patients evidence declines in episodic memory, resulting in an amnestic syndrome defined by the inability to learn new information or recall episodes. This amnestic presentation is typically followed by declines in other cognitive domains, such as semantic language ability and executive functioning. The pattern of cognitive declines follows the progression of pathology in the brain. The medial temporal (MTL) lobe, specifically the hippocampus, exhibits functional connectivity changes that portend changes in additional subcortical networks and cortical regions (Veitch et al., 2019). Accurate measurement of early and subtle declines in episodic memory is therefore useful for diagnosis and initiation of treatment (Grober et al., 2021).

For this reason, measurement of verbal episodic memory is a highly researched and widely accepted criterion for establishing risk and diagnosis. Neuropsychological assessment provides a means for quantifying episodic memory declines in functioning, but can fall short when patient performance is summarized through a single, total score measure of functioning (Wolk et al., 2011). Summary score measures of functioning can obscure nuanced relationships among cognitive abilities or between cognitive abilities and the underlying pathology (Balthazar et al., 2010). The cognitive domains of learning and memory are most frequently measured through auditory verbal episodic paradigms, including list-learning and story recall measures (Tremont et al., 2000; Weissberger et al., 2017).

The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is one of the most commonly used list learning measures of episodic memory, as it is within the public domain and has a long history of robust literature supporting its association with learning and memory (Rey, 1958). Story recall is most commonly assessed using the Wechsler Memory Scales Logical Memory subtest, which assesses immediate and delayed recall of story passages as well as recognition of story details (Drozdick, Raiford, Wahlstrom, &amp; Weiss, 2018; Wechsler, 1955). Fractionation of multi-trial measures of episodic memory, like the RAVLT, has been used previously to define early and late phases of learning. Through fractionation of the RAVLT, early learning is defined as performance on trials 1 and 2 and late learning is defined as performance on trials 4 and 5 (Putcha et al., 2019; Wolk &amp; Dickerson, 2011). The concepts of early and late learning have also been reflected in previous research evaluating individual learning slopes across multi-trial assessments. The four commonly used methods for calculating learning slope, simple slope (Jones et al., 2005), regression-based (Tulving, 1964), peak slope (McMinn et al., 1988), and two-slope (Delis et al., 2000) each weight the importance of the 5 trials in slightly different ways, with the equations of each method suggesting the presence of distinct learning processes. When comparing learning slope equations in their associations with cortical volumes, previous research has found evidence that both medial temporal lobe structures and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may contribute to learning performance (Gifford et al., 2015).

Consistent with these findings, multi-trial learning performance is often interpreted in the context of both executive functioning (EF) and memory performance. List-learning measures, relative to story recall measures, lack explicit context or organizing structures; they require participants to impose their own structure or strategy during the task in order to learn list elements (Gavett et al., 2016). Previous research has suggested that performance on neuropsychological measures of episodic memory is dependent upon coordination of multiple brain networks (Putcha et al., 2019). Numerous studies have examined the relationship between EF and episodic memory in healthy older adults (Crawford et al., 2000; Moreira et al., 2015; Salthouse, 2017; Troyer et al., 1994) as well as in samples with MCI (Chang et al., 2010; Putcha et al., 2019) and AD (Wolk &amp; Dickerson, 2011). Statistically significant positive associations are consistently observed between the domains, though the strength of association may vary as a result of the population studied and the statistical method used (Moreira et al., 2015). Although the use of multivariate analytic techniques has been limited in this literature to date, research suggests that a more comprehensive assessment of learning and memory abilities requires multiple cognitive measures, including tests of other domains, especially attention and EF (Duff et al., 2005; Salthouse, 2017; Troyer et al., 1994).

The contribution of EF to learning and memory has been assessed through memory performance comparisons between those with and without executive functioning impairments (Tremont et al., 2000; Zahodne et al., 2011). By comparing performance on word list paradigms to performance on story recall paradigms, in light of executive functioning performance, multiple studies have suggested that executive functioning relates strongly to encoding. Executive dysfunction may not significantly relate to delayed recall, but does influence measures of total learning and immediate recall (Tremont et al., 2000), or what can be thought of as short term acquisition and retrieval (Brooks et al., 2006). Similarly, simple attention has been most frequently associated with encoding, particularly as it relates to the consistency and intensity with which a participant may be attuned to stimuli (Miller &amp; Unsworth, 2021).

Others suggest that episodic memory performance is best understood in the context of brain volumes and metabolism, as with structural and functional imaging approaches (Putcha et al., 2019). These studies argue that use of neuropsychological measures in isolation produces an imprecise understanding of brain functioning (Wolk &amp; Dickerson, 2011). Wolk and Dickerson (2011) examined neural correlates of different phases of learning and memory within patients with Alzheimer’s disease using the RAVLT and other similar measures. They identified strong associations between early and late learning and the temporal pole, delayed recall and the hippocampus, and between recognition discrimination and the perirhinal and entorhinal cortex. Putcha and colleagues (2019) also found evidence that episodic memory performance was coordinated through a series of differing brain networks. Using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), they fractionated RAVLT performance into early learning, late learning, delayed recall, and retention and identified associations of each learning phase to different brain structures and cortical networks. Early learning related most strongly to the dorsal attention network, while late learning, delayed recall, and retention all related strongly to hippocampal volume. Late learning was also related to the dorsal attention network, default mode network, and frontal pole network. Delayed recall was also related to the frontal pole network and default mode network (Putcha et al., 2019). Overall, these findings demonstrate that fractionating performance on complex tests adds to our understanding of episodic memory, particularly when combined with measures of brain volume.

In the present study, we sought to further examine the relationships between the phases of episodic memory and other cognitive domains (simple attention and executive functioning) and MTL structures. Using the multivariate method, canonical correlation analysis (CCA), we created latent constructs for each domain, and investigated the associations between them, moving beyond the use of single measures and simple correlations, to more accurately characterize these relationships. We created cognitive factors for simple attention, EF, early learning, late learning, and delayed recall using two or more measured values from neuropsychological tests. We also created a factor for MTL, using bilateral volumetric MRI values of the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and entorhinal and perirhinal cortex. The present study operationalized the phases of learning and memory through fractionation of the RAVLT and the Logical Memory subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scales within a cognitively heterogeneous sample of older adults. In line with previous work with AD (Wolk &amp; Dickerson, 2011) and MCI (Putcha et al., 2019), we expected the contribution of EF to verbal episodic memory to differ across phases of learning and recall, with stronger relationships occurring between EF and early learning relative to relationships with late learning and delayed recall. We expected to see a similar pattern between simple attention and learning and memory phases, but also hypothesized that simple attention abilities may underlie all other cognitive performance, resulting in weaker, but consistent associations across the phases of learning and memory. We expected the opposite pattern between MTL volumes and learning phases, with weaker relationships occurring between MTL and early learning and stronger relationships occurring between MTL and late learning and delayed recall, as has been found in prior research.

Methods

Participants

Study participants were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal clinical cohort study through the Center for Neurodegeneration and Translational Neuroscience (CNTN). Study design and participant enrollment procedures have been described elsewhere (Miller et al., 2018). Briefly, CNTN participants receive annual evaluations that include comprehensive neurologic exam, expanded neuropsychological testing, biomarker characterization, and multimodal neuroimaging. Study participants are clinically diagnosed through a consensus conference that reviews the neurologic exam and neuropsychological testing. De-identified participant data were accessed through a data-use agreement with the CNTN, which was approved by the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health institutional review board; all enrolled CNTN participants have consented to the public access of their de-identified project data. Participants analyzed for the present study are cognitively heterogeneous older adults (N=130) with baseline clinical diagnoses of normal cognition (N=54), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; N=63), and dementia (N=13). The present study sample was identified based on the following: complete data on all neuropsychological measures, and for those with MCI or dementia, a presumed neurodegenerative etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Only baseline visit data were utilized in the present study.

Materials

Neuropsychological tests measuring the three cognitive domains, EF, simple attention, and episodic memory broken into the phases of early learning, late learning, and delayed recall were utilized to define the cognitive constructs within the CCA models. To create the EF construct, we utilized the Digit Span Backward and Digit Span Sequencing subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Drozdick, Raiford, Wahlstrom, &amp; Weiss, 2018; Wechsler, 1955), the letter/phonemic fluency score totaled from performance across letters F-A-S (Clark, et al., 1998), the Symbol-Digit Modalities Test (Smith, 1973), and Trail Making Test Part B (Reitan, 1958). To create the simple attention construct, we utilized the Color Naming and Word Reading subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System’s Color-Word Interference test (D. C. Delis et al., 2001), Digit Span Forward (Bowden, Saklofske, &amp; Weiss, 2011), and Trail Making Test Part A (Reitan, 1958). To create the constructs for the phases of learning and memory, we fractionated the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Logical Memory subtest from the Wechsler Memory Scales (Drozdick et al., 2018), consistent with previous research (Putcha et al., 2019). Specifically, early learning was defined as performance scores on learning trials 1 and 2 of the RAVLT; late learning was defined as performance scores on learning trials 4 and 5 of the RAVLT, and delayed recall was defined as performance scores from the RAVLT delayed free recall trial and the Logical Memory delayed recall.

Volumetric MRI and Data Processing

All patients were scanned on a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Malvern, PA, USA). T1-weighted images were obtained allowing for cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation via the FreeSurfer image analysis suite, version 6.0 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The technical details of these procedures have been described previously (Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 2004; Fischl &amp; Dale, 2000). Following reconstruction and segmentation, scans were visually inspected for accurate segmentation. Cortical thickness measurements were then extracted from FreeSurfer. Our MTL construct was defined as bilateral volumes of the hippocampus, parahippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and entorhinal cortex, corrected for total cranial volume.

Statistical Analysis

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a multivariate analysis based on Pearson’s r that examines the relationship between two sets of variables by identifying patterns within data sets (e.g., Moreira et al., 2015). It allows for the creation of synthetic variables, or constructs, that are formed out of component tests that measure that construct (or aspects of it). Constructs can represent independent and dependent sets of variables within the analysis (see Sherry &amp; Henson, 2005 for further explanation of CCA). We used SPSS version 26 to examine the relationships between latent constructs of early learning, late learning, and delayed recall, and latent constructs of EF, simple attention, and MTL. Comparisons between reliable canonical correlations were examined using cocor (Diedenhofen &amp; Musch, 2015), available in R and in an online application (http://comparingcorrelations.org/). In cocor, we compared dependent overlapping correlations with one-tailed tests, and relied on Pearson’s r to Filon’s z to make inferential decisions. Alpha was set at .05. We used the raw scores of all the measures, with the exception of the MTL volumes, which were corrected for total cranial volume.

Results

Participant characteristics

The 130 participants were demographically homogeneous, mostly non-Hispanic, White, and with some college education (see Table 1). Healthy control subjects were younger than the other diagnostic groups, F(2, 127) = 3.885, p = .023, but there were no differences between the groups in years of education, F(2, 127) = 2.422, p = .093. Overall cognition is characterized here through the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005) and the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975). Differences in the MoCA and MMSE total scores were as expected, with the healthy controls outperforming the MCI group (Bonferonni corrected tests, MOCA p &lt; .001; MMSE p &lt; .001), and the MCI group outperforming the Dementia group (MOCA p = .030; MMSE p = .038), MOCA F(2, 127) = 61.109, p &lt; .001, and MMSE F(2, 127) = 31.792, p &lt; .001. In order to achieve a large diagnostically heterogeneous sample, we did not differentiate or account for diagnostic group in the following CCA analyses. A small subset of included participants were missing MRI data (N=9) and were excluded from the CCA models relating MTL to learning and recall. For those analyses only, the analyzed sample consisted of 52 healthy controls, 57 participants with MCI, and 12 participants with dementia, for a total N of 121.

Executive Functioning

Figure 1 shows the relationships between EF and the phases of learning and recall (see Tables 2 and 3 for descriptive statistics on the component EF and memory tests, respectively). The left side of the figure shows the canonical correlations, and the right side depicts individual participants’ scores on the two synthetic constructs (e.g., EF scores and early learning scores in panel A). The relationship between EF and memory was expected to be strong for early learning, weaker for late learning, and weakest for delayed recall. We found a moderate relationship between EF and early learning, r = .533, 28.4% of variance explained, F(10, 246) = 4.780, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .701, a similarly-moderate relationship between EF and late learning, r = .582, 33.9% variance explained, F(10, 246) = 5.841, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .653, and another moderate relationship between EF and delayed recall, r = .611, 37.3% variance explained, F(10, 246) = 6.828, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .595. Comparison of the correlations showed no significant differences among the three, early vs. late learning z = −1.023, p = .153, late learning vs. delayed recall, z = .792, p = .214, and early learning vs. delayed recall z = 1.45, p = .074. Although the trend was in the predicted direction, the results did not confirm our hypothesis, but instead showed that the relationships between EF and memory were similar across the different phases of learning and recall.

Simple Attention

Figure 2 shows the relationships between simple attention and the phases of learning and recall (see Tables 3 and 4 for descriptive statistics on the memory measures and on simple attention, respectively). The relationship between simple attention and memory was expected to decline from early learning to late learning and delayed recall. We found a moderate relationship between simple attention and early learning, r = .486, 23.6% variance explained, F(8, 278) = 5.368, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .750, a similarly-moderate relationship between simple attention and late learning, r = .508, 25.8% variance explained, F(8, 278) = 5.367, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .740, and another moderate relationship between simple attention and delayed recall, r = .443, 19.6% variance explained, F(8, 278) = 4.287, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .787. Comparison of the correlations showed no significant differences among the three, early vs. late learning z = −.431, p = .331, late learning vs. delayed recall, z = −1.60 p = .055, early learning vs. delayed recall z = −.730, p = .767. Thus, the results did not confirm our primary hypothesis, but instead showed that simple attention was consistently and moderately related to memory performance across the learning and recall trials.

MTL

Figure 3 shows the relationships between MTL and the different learning and delayed recall stages (see Table 2 for memory measures and Table 5 for MTL values). The relationship between MTL and memory was expected to increase from early learning to late learning and delayed recall. We found a moderate relationship between MTL and early learning, r = .463, 21.4% variance explained, F(16, 250) = 2.317, p = .003, Wilks’ Λ = .758., a slightly stronger relationship between MTL and late learning1, r = .520, 27.0% variance explained, F(16, 250) = 3.960, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .636, and another stronger relationship between MTL and delayed recall, r = .569, 32.4% variance explained, F(16, 250) = 3.714, p &lt; .001, Wilks’ Λ = .653. Comparison of the correlations showed that there was a significant difference between the correlations for early learning and delayed recall, indicating that MTL was more strongly related to delayed recall, z = 1.86, p = .031. The other comparisons of correlations showed no significant differences, early learning vs. late learning z = −1.26, p = .130, late learning vs. delayed recall, z = 1.272, p = .102. These results confirmed our hypothesis and showed that MTL volume was associated with learning and memory but had a greater influence on recall than to the learning phases.

Discussion

We hypothesized that the strength of association, as measured through CCA (r), between EF, simple attention, and MTL constructs and the three constructs for learning and memory would trend in different directions, across the phases of learning and recall. Consistent with prior research, we expected to observe strong relationships between EF and early learning and simple attention and early learning, and for the strength of these relationships to decrease when evaluating associations between EF and simple attention with late learning and delayed recall. We also expected strong relationships between MTL and late learning and between MTL and delayed recall, with a relatively weaker association occurring between MTL and early learning. Our hypotheses were only partially supported. For EF, the trend of associations across learning and memory phases was in the predicted direction, but the strength of association did not significantly differ across learning and recall phases, and thus, the results did not confirm our hypothesis. Associations across the learning and memory phases showed similar contributions of EF across early and late phases, ranging from r = .53 to .61. For simple attention, CCA values ranged from r = .44 to .51 between simple attention and the phases of learning and recall. Similar to the EF results, CCA values between simple attention and the different phases of learning and recall did not significantly differ from one another. Both the EF and simple attention constructs showed roughly equivalent associations across the learning and recall trials. Although all association with EF and simple attention were statistically significant, they all fell within the moderate range and did not significantly differ from one another. Our hypothesis that EF and simple attention would be more relevant for early learning trials, relative to later phases, was not supported. Our hypothesis about the association between MTL and memory performance was supported; MTL was a significant contributor to memory performance across the learning and recall phases and this relationship increased in association strength from early learning to delayed recall, with association values ranging from r = .46 to .57.

Our results are broadly consistent with studies of normal aging, in which EF mediates the relationship between age and episodic memory performance (Crawford et al., 2000; Salthouse et al., 2003; Troyer et al., 1994). Though studies of normal aging use a variety of different cognitive tests to measure EF, many of them find evidence for the contribution of EF to memory performance, ranging from partial (Crawford et al., 2000; Salthouse et al., 2003) to complete mediation (Troyer et al., 1994). In studies of pathological aging, findings suggest a more complex pattern of association between EF, simple attention, and learning and memory, which vary by approach and sample. Chang and colleagues (2010) noted differences in association patterns between two groups of participants with MCI, those with high EF and those with low EF. Those with low EF demonstrated worse performance on all learning and memory measures, particularly early learning. Though we did not find different association strengths across the learning and memory phases for the CCA models with EF or simple attention, our sample was cognitively heterogeneous and not differentiated according to cognitive profile or diagnostic severity. It may be that such relationships are stronger in homogeneous samples of cognitively impaired participants than in a heterogeneous sample.

Another possibility is that EF is in fact important to all the phases of learning and memory in list-learning tests like the RAVLT, at least as measured in a cognitively heterogeneous sample. For instance, working-memory capacity has been shown to be important to strategy use during encoding and retrieval, such that those with lower executive functioning use fewer and poorer strategies than those with greater executive functioning (Unsworth, 2016; Unsworth &amp; Spillers, 2010). Strategy use may be particularly important during memory tests with relatively few trials, and especially after an interference trial, as in the RAVLT. Similarly, another CCA study (Duff et al., 2005) found evidence for strong relationships between EF and both immediate and delayed memory using a cognitively heterogeneous, mixed neurologic sample. Participants performing better on tests of EF also performed better on tests of memory, but there were minimal differences in CCA association strength between the models for immediate and delayed recall (Duff et al., 2005). These findings support our results as well as our secondary hypothesis for simple attention. Consistent relationships across the learning and recall phases for both attention and EF may represent the necessary underlying contributions of attention and strategy selection during unstructured cognitive tests.

Our analyses supported our hypothesis that the MTL is more strongly related to delayed recall than early learning. This is a well-established finding across neuroimaging studies (see review by (Banks et al., 2018), including those that served as a basis for our methodology, as with Putcha and colleagues who found significant associations between hippocampal volume and late learning, delayed recall, and retention, as measured through fractionation of the RAVLT (2019). However, we also observed significant positive associations between early learning and MTL, which is less established in previous research. Wolk and Dickerson (2011) did not find evidence of a relationship between MTL and early learning within a sample of participants with AD. Instead, early learning was related to the inferior parietal lobe, middle frontal gyrus, and temporal pole. Putcha and colleagues (2019) found evidence of early learning associations with the dorsal attention network, but not with MTL regions.

However, our results are consistent with the broader literature on free recall, EF, and MTL. In young adults, both EF and MTL are critical to one-trial learning. Many studies have shown that MTL is involved at both the encoding (e.g., Brassen et al., 2006; Dickerson et al., 2007) and retrieval stages of free recall (e.g., Chadwick et al., 2010; Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008; Machulda et al., 2003), similar to the first and second trials of the RAVLT. Typically, free recall is found to rely on an MTL-frontal lobe circuit (e.g., Dickerson et al., 2007; see Polyn &amp; Kahana, 2008 for a review). It is not yet clear if the patterns found for young adults in free recall hold for older adults as well. Evidence of dedifferentiation and compensatory mechanisms found in healthy older adults in recognition memory (Koen &amp; Rugg, 2019) may suggest that they are not. Further work will be important to address this issue and determine how the contribution of different regions in the MTL-frontal lobe circuit change in healthy and pathological aging.

Most of the previous research evaluating the relationships between neuropsychological functioning and brain imaging has relied upon bivariate correlation or simple regression analyses. While these are useful statistical approaches for initial investigation, multivariate methods evaluate multiple variables in a single model, providing greater nuance (Duff et al., 2005; Moreira et al., 2015). Our use of a multivariate approach within a heterogeneous sample may be the reason for our somewhat disparate findings, relative to other studies. Though neuropsychological research using CCA is limited, where available, these studies point to robust findings, including moderate (Moreira et al., 2015) and even strong (Duff et al., 2005) associations between EF and memory. We consider these factors strengths in our approach, as our findings are generalizable across a range of cognitive health and speak to domain-general abilities rather than test-specific effects. Use of multivariate approaches, including CCA, is increasing within neuroimaging research, as these approaches can identify complex patterns and networks among variables (Kwak et al., 2020), provide superior classification accuracy for clinical populations (Habeck et al., 2008), and quantify phenotypic disease signatures (Nazem et al., 2018).

Limitations

Study limitations relate to sample-specific characteristics; we have interpreted our results in light of this factor. We utilized an existing data source to analyze our hypotheses. As a result, our cognitive and MTL constructs were defined by available neuropsychological and MRI values. Though we selected tests based on evidence of construct validity for measuring simple attention, EF, and episodic memory abilities, we recognize that the measures selected may not be the most representative of their respective domains. We defined learning and recall constructs by tests that are verbal/auditory in nature; they do not capture visual contributions to memory. In contrast, about half of the tests making up the attention and EF constructs involve visual processing abilities. Therefore, the strength of our associations may be related to aspects of neuropsychological functioning not accurately or fully captured by the tests making up the two constructs within each CCA model. Though we acknowledge this weakness, findings from previous research support the existence of generally moderate (Moreira et al., 2015) or even small associations between cognitive domains (Tremont et al., 2000) and between neuropsychological measures and cortical volumes (Putcha et al., 2019), consistent with our findings. In fact, one of the main strengths of our approach is the use of a multivariate statistic that allows for the construction of latent factors, which more accurately estimate domain-general abilities as compared to single test measures. Constructs in the CCA models capture shared variability among the test values within the canonical function, and provide a more robust estimate of the cognitive domain and its associations (Moreira et al., 2015). There is considerable variability in neuropsychological measures across aging and dementia studies, particularly within the domain of EF. Future research should consider consensus approaches to test selection or robust harmonization techniques to reduce study-specific effects and allow for direct comparisons across study samples.

Finally, the homogeneity and size of our sample limits the generalizability of our findings. Our sample of primarily non-Hispanic white participants did not allow us to consider the influence of race or ethnicity. Other studies have highlighted ethnoracial differences in neuropsychological performance (Blankson &amp; Mcardle, 2017), lifestyle factors (Forrester et al., 2020), symptom-reporting (John et al., 2019), and diagnostic outcomes (Babulal et al., 2019). Our sample was also homogenous in terms of educational attainment. Education has been shown to relate strongly to concepts such as brain reserve, total intracranial volume (Neth et al., 2020), cognitive reserve (Stern et al., 1999), and neuropsychological performance (Weintraub et al., 2018). Increasing sociodemographic diversity among research participants remains a critical need in AD research. Although our sample represents cognitive heterogeneity, reflecting mixed diagnostic status and a continuum of performance levels, the relatively small sample size prevented us from exploring the influence of diagnostic group or other relevant factors, such as sex and gender identity, genetic risk, and comorbid disease.

Future Directions

Future research can address the limitations of the current analyses. Previous research, including the papers cited within, explored the relationship between brain networks and phases of learning and memory using the ADNI data set. However, these projects did not utilize CCA, nor did they take into account the influence of pathological risk and disease markers, such as APOE genotype and amyloid and tau status. Replicating our approach using the larger, etiologically similar ADNI data set would allow us to explore the associations between cognitive domains within diagnostic groups, helping to parcel out the influence of both disease severity and heterogeneous cognitive profiles. Volumetric data, though useful for measuring degeneration is limited in its ability to explain functional and network-based relationships. Future research should consider utilizing functional MRI within healthy samples to evaluate these same associations. Doing so would help elucidate cognitive network contributions to learning and memory, which may be both altered in clinical neurologic samples and obscured by mechanisms of compensation not readily assessed through volumetric MRI. We also intend to explore the longitudinal associations between cognitive and MTL constructs and the phases of learning and memory as the CNTN cohort continues to expand and collect additional follow up evaluations.

Note. MMSE = Mini-Mental State Exam; MOCA = Montreal Cognitive Assessment; F = Number of females. Values are frequencies or means (with standard deviations); MMSE and MOCA Total are raw scores. The MCI group was significantly older than the controls, p = .021, but no other differences were found for age. Education did not differ across groups, F(2,129) = 2.42, p = .093. MMSE, F(2,129) = 31.79, p &lt; .001, and MOCA, F(2,129) = 61.11, p &lt; .001, differed significantly across diagnostic groups. Paired comparisons showed that all three groups differed from each other on the MMSE and the MOCA Total.

Declaration of Interest

The authors have no potential competing interests to report.

1 A second function was also significant with a canonical correlation of r = .358, 12.8% variance explained, F(16, 250) = 2.643, p = .014, Wilks’ Λ = .872. This function represents variance that is independent of that accounted for in the first function; because this was unexpected, explains little variance, and it is not clear what constructs it represents, we refrain from interpreting it.
