Stroke and dementia are the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Cerebrovascular disease, particularly cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is implicated in both, and the two main types of CSVD (hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy) account for the majority of cerebrovascular contributions to stroke and dementia. Current knowledge of CSVD may influence treatment decisions and preventive efforts. Although the causes of CSVD are not entirely elucidated, ongoing research of the pathophysiology of CSVD, such as the role of inflammation, is helping identify potential treatment targets, evaluate prediction models and develop preventive strategies. Given the detectability of CSVD in preclinical stages using brain MRI, a long window of opportunity is presented to implement existent preventive measures. This review considers CSVD including its subclinical manifestations detected using brain MRI, clinical manifestations, use of markers of CSVD as predictors of clinical outcomes such as dementia and stroke, and presents potential management strategies when seeing patients with cerebral small vessel disease to reduce its disease burden and clinical consequences. Clinical trials have evaluated some aspects of CSVD treatment and are beginning to recognize CSVD as endpoint in subclinical stages. Future studies will clarify if this approach is able to delay onset of dementia and prevent stroke occurrence, meanwhile implementation of existent recommendations for the prevention and treatment of stroke and dementia may reduce disability and clinical outcomes related to CSVD.


pmcIntroduction

Stroke and dementia are the most common neurological disorders, affecting millions of individuals every year around the world.[1] The costs implied in health care are enormous and are expected to increase, due to the high prevalence of both disorders in the elderly and the trend of rising global life expectancy.[2] Cerebrovascular disease, particularly cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), is implicated in both stroke and dementia.[3, 4] CSVD contributes to both types of stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic[5] with some studies suggesting that it causes approximately 25% of all ischemic strokes and the majority of intracerebral hemorrhages.[6] CSVD refers to cerebral vascular disorders that affect the small arteries and arterioles of the brain supplying cortical and subcortical regions (Figure 1). Advancements in neuro imaging have allowed the visualization of CSVD both in subclinical and in clinical stages, and characterization of the two main pathologic subtypes: ischemic and hemorrhagic (Table 1). Measures of subclinical ischemic CSVD include covert (“silent”) brain infarcts (CBI), white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS), while subclinical hemorrhage-prone CSVD includes cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) (Figure 2). When CSVD becomes clinically manifest, ischemic CSVD can present as lacunar infarcts, which represent approximately 25% percent of all ischemic strokes;[7] meanwhile hemorrhage prone CVSD can become symptomatic and cause most primary intracerebral hemorrhages.[5] Both forms can cause transient neurological symptoms. Although no specific treatment for CSVD exists, detection of CSVD, even incidentally, is highly relevant: 1) persons with severe forms of subclinical CSVD may be at highest risk for clinical events, 2) modifiable risk factors have been strongly associated with several forms of subclinical CSVD, 3) there is a window of opportunity to implement careful and close supervision of existent preventive treatments for individuals with established CSVD, and 4) several therapeutic targets for CSVD are being evaluated, including interventional clinical trials that use incidence of some forms of CSVD detected on MRI as end points.

The present manuscript reviews CSVD, discussing the role of inflammation in its pathophysiology, use of markers of CSVD as predictors of clinical outcomes such as dementia and stroke, and presents potential management strategies when seeing patients with cerebral small vessel disease to reduce its disease burden and clinical consequences.

What is CSVD?

Histopathology studies have characterized CSVD in two main subtypes: Type 1 arteriolosderosis, and Type 2, cerebral amyloid angiopathy.[8] Type 1 involves loss of smooth muscle cells from the tunica media, deposition of fibro-hyaline material, narrowing of the lumen, and thickening of the vessel wall. It is strongly associated with modifiable vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, smoking and with aging.[9] This type is represented on brain MRI by white matter lesions and microinfarcts/lacunar infarcts whereas Type 2 CSVD is thought to correlate with cerebral microbleeds and lobar hemorrhages.[10] Type 2 CSVD correlates with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and is characterized by the progressive accumulation of congophilic, beta amyloid protein in the walls of small-to-medium sized arteries and arterioles. There is the typical green birefringent appearance with Congo red stain as well as “double barrel” appearance of cerebral vessel wall under light microscopy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy involves cerebral cortical vessels and leptomeningeal arteries where focal accumulation of amyloid weakens vessel wall and causes either localized luminal occlusion or wall fragmentation with hemorrhage. Thus, this angiopathy has been associated with both, cerebral ischemic lesions such as white matter hyperintensities[11] and microinfarcts,[12] and with hemorrhagic lesions including cerebral microbleeds[13] and lobar hemorrhages.[14] Mild degrees of cerebral amyloid angiopathy are almost always seen in Alzheimer’s disease.[15]

Epidemiology and Imaging Markers of CSVD

The prevalence of subclinical ischemic CSVD in the general population, ranges between 8-28% for covert brain infarcts,[16] up to 80% for white matter hyperintensities,[17] and up to 30% in the case of cerebral microbleeds.[18] In persons with stroke and dementia, these markers are even more frequent.[19] Further, both ischemic and hemorrhage-prone CSVD frequently coexist, which may complicate management decisions when severe.

Subclinical CSVD (Figure 2)

Covert Brain Infarcts (CBI) are focal lesions in the brain tissue that can cause symptoms but may be overlooked by patients themselves and therefore have been called “silent”. The infarcts are usually small between 3 and 15 mm diameter, but may also be larger.[20, 21]

Based on eight population-based studies, the prevalence of CBI ranges between 8-28% in the general healthy population.[16, 22, 23] In contrast, patients with a history of stroke have prevalence, up to 57%.[24] CBI can also be microinfarcts, smaller than lacunar infarcts, and can be seen in cortical and subcortical regions, sometimes detected in acute stages on diffusion-weighted imaging.[25] While CBI were originally termed “silent” they have been consistently associated with cognitive impairment, dementia[26] and stroke.[27]

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are defined by regions of high intensity seen on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences, usually seen around the ventricles and deep white matter. WMH are seen in 11-21% persons in the general adult population, increasing with age and observed in 64-94% of the population by age 82.[28, 29] Both WMH and CBI have been shown to increase risk of intracerebral hemorrhage[30] and more than 3-fold increase risk for ischemic strokes.[31]

Enlarged perivascular space (ePVS) or Virchow-Robin spaces are detected on MRI around small penetrating cerebral arterioles, corresponding to subarachnoid space extensions.[32] ePVS are seen on T1 and T2-weighted sequences throughout the brain and can mimic small lacunar infarcts, but are generally smaller than 3 mm in size, with round or linear shape, and most frequently lacking a surrounding rim of gliosis.[33, 34] They are increasingly accepted as neuroimaging findings of CSVD[35] and thought to represent routes of interstitial fluid and solute drainage in the brain (“glymphatic system”).[36] Severe ePVS have been associated with vascular risk factors, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and dementia.[35]

Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a type of subclinical hemorrhagic marker of CSVD, characterized as small foci of hemorrhage and tissue necrosis detected on gradient echo (T2*weighted [T2 “star” weighted]) MRI sequences, usually measuring less than 10 mm.[37] CMB are detected in about 5 to 30% of the general population, however can be detected in 23-44% in patients with history of ischemic stroke, and 52-83% in patients with a history of intracerebral hemorrhages.[37] CMB are markers for one or both of the two most common arteriopathies causing intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly: hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Hypertensive vasculopathy is associated with vascular risk factors and cause hemorrhages in the deep regions of the brain, while cerebral amyloid angiopathy is associated with superficial or cortical hemorrhages and shows a strong association with APOE-ε4 genotype.[38, 39] CMB can be detected incidentally in asymptomatic persons; however they are associated with cognitive decline, dementia, stroke and mortality.[40–43]

Cortical superficial siderosis (CSS) is another subclinical hemorrhagic marker of CSVD detected on MRI representing subpial deposits of hemosiderin in the cerebral convexities. Recent studies have shown a strong potentiating association of CSS with cerebral amyloid angiopathy: the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients without CSS, with mild CSS and with severe CSS increases from 25% to 29% and 74% in a 4 year period, respectively.[44] In addition, CSS is associated with poor cognitive function. Patients with CSS and Alzheimer’s disease have lower MMSE scores compared to those without CSS.[45]

Clinical Manifestations

Clinical manifestations of CSVD include acute events (stroke and transient neurological events) and chronic consequences such as dementia and disability. Ischemic strokes ascribed to CSVD are typically lacunar strokes corresponding to stereotypical clinical syndromes depending on their location. Lacunar infarcts range in size from 3 to 15 mm.[20] The classic lacunar syndromes were initially described by Dr. CM Fisher: pure motor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, ataxic hemiparesis and dysarthria clumsy hand syndrome, but other less frequent syndromes are also seen.[46] CSVD also causes intracerebral hemorrhages; those in deep regions are typically due to hypertensive arteriopathy and are associated with traditional vascular risk factors, while cortical or lobar hemorrhages are attributed to cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the elderly.[47]

Among the chronic clinical manifestations of CSVD are progressive cognitive, gait and mood decline.[48, 49] Its association with dementia usually follows a slow progressive course, but may have step-wise decline when clinical strokes occur.[48, 49] In the VANTAGE trial, the majority of vascular dementia (75%) was attributed to CSVD, versus 18% to large vessel and 8% to a combination of small and large vessel disease.[50] CSVD is also associated with risk of stroke, with higher burden of CSVD correlating to higher stroke risk.[51] The burden of CSVD is also a predictor for age-related disability. The LADIS study (a multicenter Leukoaraiosis and Disability study), found that at 3-yr follow up of patients with mild, moderate, severe WMHs on MRI, patients with severe white matter disease were nearly three times more likely to transition to disability and death (29.5% vs. 10.5%) compared to the mild group.[52]

The chronic clinical symptoms are correlated with the severity of CSVD. Those with mild degrees detected on MRI[52] may have mild cognitive decline including impairments in executive functions and attention, and experience late onset depressed mood. Patients may also show slower gait and speech, and postural instability. In patients with moderate evidence of CSVD on MRI cognitive functions continue to deteriorate, and may qualify for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment. Patients’ gait becomes slower, showing some parkinsonian features (i.e. wide-based, shuffling, steppage gait). Patients may also exhibit pseudo-bulbar signs including inappropriate laughing/crying, dysphagia and dysarthria. In patients with severe evidence of CSVD on MRI, patients may be diagnosed with clinically evident dementia.[52]

CSVD and stroke risk stratification

Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases are the main contributors to mortality globally, about 1 in 3 Americans will die either from cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease every year; stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the U.S. (2013 and 2014) and 2nd leading cause in the world,[2, 53] but the leading cause of disability in America.[2] For patients over the age of 65, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease emerge as leading causes of death.[53] Hence, cerebral small vessel disease becomes an important category of cerebrovascular diseases worth understanding and preventing. In a 10-year prospective study from Netherlands, Poels, et al. found that MRI evidence of CSVD (“silent” brain infarcts and periventricular WMH), improved stroke risk prediction over traditional risk factors from 0.73 to 0.75 in men and 0.69 to 0.77 in women.[54] Another study by Staals et al, showed that MRI markers of CSVD can be used to predict cognitive decline; in this study, 4 MRI markers of CSVD (WMH, lacunes, CMBs and perivascular spaces) were used to create a composite cerebral small vessel disease burden score (scaled 0-4); Generally, 1 point is assigned for each of the 4 imaging markers above when they reach a certain imaging threshold, i.e. confluent deep WMH (Fazekas score 2 or 3 [79]) and or irregular periventricular WMH with Fazekas score 3, lacunes, 1 or more CMBs, and moderate to severe basal ganglia perivascular spaces. The MRI load score was then used as risk predictor, showing that CSVD disease burden as reflected by higher score predicts lower cognitive ability in older patients.[55] Similarly, a separate group evaluated a scoring system representing overall burden of CSVD, finding an association of higher CSVD score were associated with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage attributed to cerebral amyloid angiopathy.[56]

Inflammation in the pathophysiology of CSVD (Figure 3)

Although the pathophysiology of CSVD is not entirely elucidated, inflammation has been associated with the main types, CAA and hypertensive arteriopathy, with the MRI markers of CSVD and with the main clinical outcomes associated with CSVD including cognitive impairment,[57] dementia[58] and stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic).[59, 60]

Cellular and molecular inflammatory mechanisms may play a role in the various stages of CSVD. For instance, the matrix metalloproteinases, a large family of enzymes capable of degrading the extracellular matrix produced by inflammatory cells, have been linked to disruption of the blood brain barrier and hemorrhage.[61] MMP-9 in particular has been linked to intracerebral hemorrhage and higher risk of hemorrhagic complications following thrombolytic therapy.[62] Inflammation may also complicate immune therapies for removal of beta amyloid from the brain of Alzheimer disease patients, a process linked to pre-existent CSVD.[63] It is thought that removal of beta amyloid from brain parenchyma induced by immune therapy may overwhelm diseased small cerebral vessels and trigger an inflammatory response that may be life threatening (cerebral amyloid angiopathy related inflammation – ARIA).[64]

A recent report by Framingham Heart Study investigators also related inflammation biomarkers to CSVD in subclinical stages. Shoamanesh et al, related circulating levels of 15 inflammatory biomarkers and brain MRI measures of CSVD MRI (CBIs, CMBs, and WMHs) in 1,763 asymptomatic individuals. Of all, 4 biomarkers (C-reactive protein, Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, vascular endothelial growth factor and homocysteine) were associated with CSVD. Further, results of this study suggested that the inflammatory biomarkers (hence molecular mechanisms) differ between ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of CSVD: elevated circulating myeloperoxidase and TNFR2 levels were seen in patients with CMBs, whereas elevated circulating levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 mass and lower myeloperoxidase were associated with presence of CBIs).[65] Importantly, some of these markers are potential therapeutic targets. For instance, TNF based therapy is currently used for treatment of rheumatologic disorders.[66]

On the other hand, some inflammatory mediators may participate in both ischemic and hemorrhage-prone CSVD. For instance, release of cytokines and neopterin has been shown to weaken the extracellular matrix of the endothelium of the blood brain barrier,[67] which leads to blood brain barrier breakdown and hemorrhage, but have also been implicated in the pathologic changes in small arteries and arterioles that overtime can be visualized as WMH, enlarged perivascular spaces or CMBs.[68]

Recent reports have also shown that prominent microglial activation, the main inflammatory cell type in the brain, is involved in CSVD, stroke and dementia.[69] The site of inflammation includes small vessel wall, perivascular spaces and adjacent brain parenchyma.[70] Imaging of microglial activation is being evaluated as tool for preclinical identification of AD patients.[71]

In addition, inflammatory biomarkers may have a role as predictors of stroke risk in asymptomatic individuals. For instance, in the Framingham Heart study, investigators evaluated whether a panel of 15 inflammation biomarkers improved stroke risk prediction in asymptomatic persons beyond the traditional Framingham stroke risk profile. Four of the biomarkers (CRP/C-reactive protein, TNFR2/Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, VEGF/vascular endothelial growth factor, homocysteine) were associated with incident ischemic stroke, and led to improved stroke risk prediction.[72] However, further studies are required to establish clinically relevant thresholds.

Beyond inflammation in the cerebrovascular system, alternative inflammatory mechanisms have been proposed that may play a role in the pathophysiology of CSVD. The brain-gut axis is one of such mechanisms, which proposes that gastrointestinal and oral infections can increase the risk of neurodegeneration.[73] In support of this hypothesis prior reports have shown an association of the oral bacteria S. mutans with atherosclerotic plaques[74] and CMBs.[75]

Lastly, a subset of uncommon forms of inflammatory CSVD may present with acute manifestations, such as stroke, seizures or encephalopathy. These include infections such as meningovascular syphilis, HIV vasculopathy, and idiopathic vasculitides such as isolated CNS vasculitis.

Considerations for Clinical Practice and Management

Sporadic cerebral small vessel disease is an often overlooked, but important form of cerebrovascular disease. Although previously only recognized on post-mortem pathology studies, CSVD is now readily visualized in brain MRI, before occurrence of clinical events. With time and accumulation of CSVD lesions, CSVD increases risk for stroke, dementia and disability. Thus, incidental finding of imaging markers of CVSD (i.e. WMH, CBI, ePVS, CMB, CSS), should serve as clinical indicators to prompt more stringent control of traditional vascular risk factors. A summary of therapies aimed at various clinical stages and manifestations of the disease burden based on a comprehensive review by Bath and Wardlaw, is presented in Table 2.[76]

Two major management strategies for CSVD are secondary stroke prevention and dementia management. In terms of secondary stroke prevention, practitioners should focus on managing traditional vascular risk factors including: hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking. A recent large clinical trial specifically studied the prevention of recurrent events in patients with clinically manifest CSVD. The SPS3 trial (Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes), assessed strict blood pressure management (&lt;130 vs. 130-149), and single vs. dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin vs. aspirin + clopidogrel). The authors concluded that there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death, myocardial infarction or stroke in both arms; however, the more intense blood pressure reduction arm was well tolerated and had reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage[77] while the dual antiplatelet arm showed increased risk of bleeding and was stopped.[78] The PROGRESS trial studied the effect of a combination of ACE-I perindopril + diuretic indapamide, and showed reduced amount of white matter disease on MRI with strict blood pressure management.[79] Although previous clinical trials have not evaluated subclinical CSVD as outcomes, the landscape is changing and such markers are now the object of clinical trials including consideration of incident covert brain infarct and cerebral microbleeds.

In addition, the presence of concurrent ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of CSVD, present a clinical dilemma. In patients with severe CSVD, the concomitant use of anticoagulation (along with age &gt;65 years old) portends increased risk for bleeding, compared to those without CSVD.[80] In the case of acute stroke management, there is an increased risk of hemorrhagic conversion of an ischemic brain infarct of up to 10% in the presence of moderate to severe small vessel disease on neuroimaging[81] vs. 6.4% risk found in the original NINDS trial.[82] Although in most instances the presence of severe forms of CSVD do not contraindicate use of anticoagulation or thrombolysis in patients where clear indications exist, the type and burden of CSVD may inform of higher risks and assist in discussion of the risk and benefits with patients. On the other hand, if there is no definite indication for long term use of such therapies, detection of CSVD may lead to reassessment of the risk/benefit ratio. With regards to antiplatelet therapy, the clinical event guides the decision to use it for long term. Several clinical trials have shown efficacy of antiplatelet agents for secondary stroke prevention in patients with CSVD.[83] However, long term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is not effective in reducing recurrent ischemic stroke risk and increases risk of hemorrhagic complications, thus it is not used for this purpose.[78] Presence of hemorrhagic CSVD may also affect decisions to use statin therapy. A controversial risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with statin therapy and very low cholesterol levels has been debated. In the Framingham Study, use of statin therapy was independently associated with the presence of CMB.[84] However, when there is a clear indication for use of statin therapy, evidence from numerous randomized clinical trials support their long term use. Last, CSVD also modifies perioperative risk for procedures such as carotid endarterectomy and other major vascular surgery: the NASCET trial (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) showed three times increased risk of stroke and death within the 30-day perioperative period in patients with leukoaraiosis.[85]

The management of dementia symptoms in patients with vascular dementia proves similar to other forms of dementia. There are a few available therapies for improved dementia symptoms, including memantine (an NMDA receptor, improvement in cognition),[86] acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine,[87] donepezil[88] (tested in patients with a genetic form of CSVD, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy – CADASIL) and rivastigmine.[50] Low vitamin B12 level has been correlated with white matter lesion volume,[89] and the VITAPTOPS trial showed some benefits in managing WMH change in patients with severe disease burden at baseline,[90] although there was no clear benefit of Vitamin B supplementation for stroke risk reduction.[91]

Conclusion

Cerebral small vessel disease is a major contributor to the most devastating neurological disorders, stroke and dementia. Current knowledge of CSVD may influence treatment decisions and preventive efforts. Ongoing research of the pathophysiology of CSVD, such as the role of inflammation, is helping identify potential treatment targets, evaluate prediction models and develop preventive strategies. Given the detectability of CSVD in preclinical stages using brain MRI, a long window of opportunity is presented to implement existent preventive measures; clinical trials are beginning to recognize CSVD as endpoint in subclinical stages. Future studies will clarify if this approach is able to delay onset of dementia and prevent stroke occurrence.
