Brain accumulation of soluble oligomers of the amyloid-β peptide (AβOs) is increasingly considered a key early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A variety of AβO species have been identified, both in vitro and in vivo, ranging from dimers to 24mers and higher-order oligomers. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding which AβO species are most germane to AD pathogenesis. Antibodies capable of specifically recognizing defined subpopulations of AβOs would be a valuable asset in the identification, isolation, and characterization of AD-relevant AβO species. Here, we report the characterization of a human single chain antibody fragment (scFv) denoted NUsc1, one of a number of scFvs we have identified that stringently distinguish AβOs from both monomeric and fibrillar Aβ. NUsc1 readily detected AβOs previously bound to dendrites in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, NUsc1 blocked AβO binding and reduced AβO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and tau hyperphosphorylation in cultured neurons. NUsc1 further distinguished brain extracts from AD-transgenic mice from wild type mice, and detected endogenous AβOs in fixed AD brain tissue and AD brain extracts. Biochemical analyses indicated that NUsc1 targets a subpopulation of AβOs with apparent molecular mass greater than 50 kDa. Results indicate that NUsc1 targets a particular AβO species relevant to AD pathogenesis, and suggest that NUsc1 may constitute an effective tool for AD diagnostics and therapeutics.

Graphical abstract

Many different species of Aβ oligomers (AβOs) have been identified in the Alzheimer’s diseased brain but it is unclear which of these species are most relevant to the disease. Here we describe a single chain antibody (scFv), NUsc1, that preferentially targets a subset of AβO species. Neutralization of these species by incubation with NUsc1 prevents the AD hallmarks of Tau hyperphosphorylation and oxidative stress. Thus, NUsc1 may be considered a strong new candidate for anti-Alzheimer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

Evidence obtained during the past two decades implicates the accumulation of soluble Aβ oligomers (AβOs) in the brain, rather than fibrillar Aβ deposits in plaques, as the primary synaptotoxic form of Aβ (Klein 2013, Selkoe &amp; Hardy 2016, Hayden &amp; Teplow 2013, Ferreira &amp; Klein 2011). Although the toxicity of AβOs was identified almost twenty years ago (Lambert et al. 1998), the identity of the most Alzheimer’s Disease-relevant AβO species remains unknown (Benilova et al. 2012, Viola &amp; Klein 2015). Dimers, trimers, and other low molecular weight AβOs have been implicated in AD pathogenesis (Walsh et al. 2005, Cleary et al. 2005, Figueiredo et al. 2013, Li et al. 2011). Others have proposed a primary pathogenic role for higher molecular weight soluble AβOs, i.e., greater than 50 kDa (Gong et al. 2003, Velasco et al. 2012, Lesne et al. 2006, Mc Donald et al. 2015, Savioz et al. 2016).

Due to the non-abundance of AβOs in AD brain as well as their instability and molecular heterogeneity (Teplow 2013), antibodies have played a prominent role in the identification and characterization of AD-relevant AβOs. A number of anti-Aβ conformational-specific antibodies have been developed (Murakami 2014, Goure et al. 2014, Viola &amp; Klein 2015) and utilized to characterize distinct AβO conformations, including annular protofibrillar oligomers (Kayed et al. 2009), amylospheroids (Noguchi et al. 2009, Matsumura et al. 2011), and globulomers (Hillen et al. 2010), among others. Notably, it is now recognized that distinct AβO conformations have differential neurotoxicity (Figueiredo et al, 2013). In line with this notion, Ashe and colleagues have classified AβOs isolated from the brains of AD mice as “Type I” and “Type II” AβOs (Liu et al. 2015), with Type I AβOs being involved in cognitive impairment. This type of conformational classification is in harmony with our previous demonstration that AβOs of molecular mass greater than 50 kDa are AD-relevant, while those less than 50 kDa are not (Velasco et al. 2012, Sebollela et al. 2014, Lacor et al. 2007).

In addition to full-length IgG antibodies, conformation-specific antibody fragments against Aβ have been developed. Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) phage-display technology allows screening of hundreds of scFvs for the ability to bind an antigen of interest with relatively little effort, in a process termed biopanning (Ahmad et al. 2012, Azzazy &amp; Highsmith 2002). Solomon and colleagues first demonstrated that a scFv produced by phage-display retained the ability to block Aβ fibril formation, similar to its parent IgM (Frenkel et al. 2000). The same group subsequently demonstrated that filamentous phage could be used as a vector to deliver scFvs to Aβ plaques in the brain when introduced intranasally in mice (Frenkel &amp; Solomon 2002, Solomon &amp; Frenkel 2002). Since then, many groups have developed anti-Aβ scFvs (Liu et al. 2004, Medecigo et al. 2010, Solorzano-Vargas et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2016). Conformation-specific anti-Aβ scFvs in the literature include those specific for AβOs (Wang et al. 2009, Zameer et al. 2008, Meli et al. 2009), AβOs and protofibrils (Zhang et al. 2015), and AβO subpopulations (Kasturirangan et al. 2013, Kasturirangan et al. 2012).

Here, we present the characterization of a human scFv antibody specific for a particular sub-species of AD-relevant AβOs. This scFv, termed NUsc1, is one of a set of scFvs we isolated by biopanning against AβOs, which stringently distinguish AβOs from both monomeric and fibrillar Aβ. The relevance to AD of the AβO species targeted by NUsc1 is demonstrated by the finding that NUsc1 distinguishes AD brains from non-demented controls and AD mouse brains from wt mice. Furthermore, NUsc1 reduced neuronal oxidative stress and tau hyperphosphorylation in hippocampal cultures exposed to AβOs. Results further indicated that NUsc1 selectively binds a small subset of oligomer species in the ensemble of AβOs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Screening and isolation of anti-AβOs scFvs

Anti-AβO scFv selection was performed as previously reported (Velasco et al. 2012). Briefly, AβOs were prepared using Aβ1–42 (American Peptide) as in (Chromy et al. 2003). When separated by HPLC-SEC, AβO preparations displayed a typical 2-peak profile comprising low and high molecular mass oligomers (Sebollela et al. 2014). Freshly prepared AβOs were immobilized in immunotubes (Nunc) at 10 µg/mL (mass refers to Aβ1–42 monomer) overnight at 37 °C. Clones with high affinity for AβOs were selected from the Tomlinson I + J human scFv library (Nissim et al. 1994) by phage display after four rounds of panning. Selected E.coli TG1 clones were used to produce phage displaying scFvs after co-infection with helper phage KM13. Supernatants containing phage-bound scFvs were directly used or partially purified by polyethylene glycol (MW 6000)/NaCl precipitation (Barbas III et al. 2004).

Production of phage-free NUsc1

Phage-free NUsc1 was produced by expression in the HB2151 E.coli strain with IPTG induction essentially as described in (Barbas III et al. 2004). Phage-free NUsc1 was purified from both the supernatant and cell lysate of the HB2151 cells using a Protein A affinity column (Nissim et al. 1994). The concentration of soluble protein in the supernatant was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm, assuming that the A280 of a 0.7 mg/mL solution is equal to 1 (Griffiths et al. 1993). Purified NUsc1 was stored in PBS (Dulbecco’s PBS without calcium or magnesium; Corning), pH 7.4 at −80 °C. After analysis by SDS-PAGE and SEC, the following were added to NUsc1 for cryoprotection: 15% glycerol, 0.1% casein, and 1 mM PMSF (Brichta et al. 2003).

SDS-PAGE and SEC analysis of phage-free NUsc1

Purified phage-free NUsc1 (1 µg) was resolved on a 4–15% Tris-Glycine gel (BioRad). Coomassie dye (Imperial Protein Stain, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for total protein detection. Alternatively, protein was transferred to nitrocellulose, which was probed by anti-c-myc (1 µg/mL, clone 9E10 from ATCC) followed by anti-mouse-IgG-HRP (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or anti-6xHis-HRP (1:5,000; Pierce). FPLC-SEC was conducted at 4 °C on a Superdex 200 Increase SEC column (GE Life Sciences), calibrated with seven protein standards ranging from 6.5–669 kDa, with PBS (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) as the mobile phase. Blue dextran was used to determine the column void volume.

Dot immunoblotting with phage-free NUsc1

AβOs were titrated in PBS (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Phage-free NUsc1 or NU2 (Lambert et al. 2007) primary antibodies, both at 8 µg/mL, were incubated overnight at 4 °C. HRP-linked antibodies against the 6xHis tag (for NUsc1 detection; Proteintech Group Inc) or mouse-IgG (for NU2 detection; GE Lifesciences) were used for 1 hour at room temperature. Chemiluminescent signal was developed using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoScientific).

ELISA with phage-free NUsc1

AβOs (100 µL at 200 nM in PBS per well, or variable concentrations, where indicated) were incubated in high-adsorption 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, ThermoFisher Scientific) overnight at 4 °C with gentle orbital agitation. The next day, the plate was washed/blocked three times with 3% BSA/PBS (2 × 10 min; 1 × 30 min). NUsc1 was added at 16 µg/mL (or variable concentrations, where indicated) in 3% BSA/PBS and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate was washed three times with 0.1% Tween 20/PBS using a plate washer (BioTek). HRP-conjugated antibody against 6xHis diluted 1:1000 in 3% BSA/PBS were added for 45 min at room temperature. The plate was washed again three times with 0.1% Tween 20/PBS. Colorimetric signal was developed with TMB (tetramethylbenzidine; Sigma). Reaction was stopped by addition of 10% phosphoric acid. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured on BioTek Synergy plate reader.

Immunoprecipitation of AβOs with NUsc1

Magnetic beads for His-tag isolation (Dynabeads; Invitrogen) were functionalized with phage-free NUsc1 following manufacturer’s instructions. Functionalization was confirmed by reactivity to HRP-conjugated anti-c-myc (9E10; RRID: AB_627268) as measured by colorimetric conversion of peroxidase substrate TMB (Sigma) (not shown). For immunoprecipitation, freshly prepared AβOs were fractionated by centrifugal filtration using 50 kDa MWCO membranes (Microcon YM-50; Amicon) as in (Velasco et al. 2012). 1.2 µg of the resulting filtrate or retentate were diluted in 0.1 % BSA/PBS and incubated with NUsc1-functionalized or non-functionalized beads (10 µL) for 16 h at 4 °C. Next, beads were washed twice with 0.1 % BSA/PBS, resuspended in denaturing SDS-PAGE buffer, and loaded onto a 10–20% Tris-Tricine gel (Life Technologies). Total protein was detected on the gel by silver staining (SilverXpress, Invitrogen).

Oligomerization of tau

Oligomerization of tau was performed as described (Ward et al. 2013). Briefly, the 2N4R isoform of human recombinant tau (rPeptide) was incubated at 4 µM with 75 µM of arachidonic acid in aggregation buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 5 mM DTT) for 6 h at room temperature with no agitation. To stop the reaction, the buffer was exchanged to PBS via 3 rounds of buffer exchange in a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter (Millipore Ultrafree-MC). The sample was stored at −80 °C until analysis. Successful oligomerization was confirmed by Western immunoblotting (Supp. Fig. 1). For this, samples were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer without addition of a reducing agent or sample boiling. 10 ng of tau was loaded per well of a 4–20% Tris-Glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex, ThermoFisher Scientific). After transfer, tau was detected using the DA31 total tau antibody (Acker et al. 2013) diluted to 1.5 µg/mL.

AβO-Tau competition sandwich ELISA

AβOs were stabilized by the chemical cross-linker DFDNB (1,5-Difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; Sigma) by incubating with a 5-fold molar excess of DFDNB over Aβ peptide for 10 min at room temperature (Grimm et al. 2007). The cross-linking reaction was quenched by incubation with DTT at a 1:1 molar ratio with DFNDB for 30 min at room temperature. For ELISA, high-adsorption 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, ThermoFisher Scientific) were coated by overnight stationary incubation with 100 µL of monoclonal anti-AβO antibody NU2 (Lambert et al. 2007) at 1.0 µg/mL in PBS at 4 °C. The next day, the plate was blocked with 200 µL of 3% BSA/PBS (2 × 10 min, 1 × 30 min) without agitation. 100 µL of DFDNB-AβOs were added at 16–1000 nM for AβO dose-response, or 125 nM for tau-competition, diluted in 3% BSA/PBS and incubated 2 h at room temperature, with no agitation. Wells were then washed 3x with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS and incubated with phage-free NUsc1 at 16 µg/mL either without tau (AβO dose-response) or with 25–800 nM tau (tau competition) in 3% non-fat milk/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-6xHis (Proteintech). Plates were developed using TMB (Sigma). Absorbance at 405 nm was measured on a BioTek Synergy plate reader.

Primary neuronal cultures and immunocytochemistry

Hippocampal neurons from rat embryos were cultured according to (Brewer et al. 1993). Briefly, a pregnant Sprague−Dawley rat (gestation day 18) was anesthetized, decapitated, embryos removed, and the embryonic hippocampi were dissected and dissociated. Dissociated cells were plated and maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) for at least 18 days before treatment. Animals were handled in accordance with national guidelines laid down by the NIH regarding care and use of animals for experimental procedures. After maturation of the cultures, cells were exposed to AβOs (250 nM) for 30 minutes at 37 °C, washed twice with medium, and fixed using 4% formaldehyde/4% sucrose. Cells were blocked with 5% normal goat serum/PBS, and incubated with indicated primary antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor®-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) at 1:500 – 1:1,000. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold containing DAPI (Life Technologies), air-dried, and imaged using a Nikon TE-2000 inverted microscope.

Neuroprotection by NUsc1

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated in live neurons as described previously (Saraiva et al. 2010, Figueiredo et al. 2013, De Felice et al. 2007) using the fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen). Mature hippocampal cultures were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with vehicle or 500 nM AβOs in the presence of NUsc1, as indicated. In the last 40 minutes of exposure to AβOs, cells were incubated with 2 µM CM-H2DCFDA at 37 °C. Cells were then rinsed three times with warm PBS and imaged. Quantitative analysis of DCF fluorescence data was performed using Image J (NIH), as previously described (Figueiredo et al. 2013). The ability of NUsc1 to prevent AβO-induced tau hyperphosphorylation was also evaluated. Primary hippocampal cultures were exposed to AβOs (500 nM) in the absence or presence of phage-free NUsc1 (25 µg/mL), or to phage-free NUsc1 alone, for 5 hours. Prior to addition to cell culture, AβOs and NUsc1, alone or mixed, were incubated in Neurobasal medium for 30 minutes at 37 °C. After treatment, cells were fixed with 1.85 % formaldehyde for 10 min followed by 3.7 % formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were washed 3 × 5 min in PBS, then blocked with 10% normal goat serum/PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with anti-pTau[T205] (Sigma; diluted 1:500 in 10% normal goat serum/PBS) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the appropriate Alexa Fluor-linked secondary antibodies (1:2000 in 1% normal goat serum/PBS) for at least 3 hours. To visualize nuclei, Hoescht (Invitrogen) was added at 2 µg/mL immediately prior to imaging at 40x on the ImageXpress High Content Imaging Robotic Platform (Molecular Devices). 25–100 images were collected per condition. Image analysis was performed in ImageJ (NIH). To quantify tau phosphorylation, corrected total cell fluorescence was normalized by cell count, determined by Hoescht staining of nuclei.

Brain extracts

A procedure based on (Gong et al. 2003) was utilized to prepare extracts from the cortices of 5xFAD transgenic mice (Oakley et al. 2006), as well as from the frontal cortex of AD or age-matched cognitively normal human subjects. 5xFAD heterozygous males were purchased from MMRRC (RRID: MMRRC_034840-JAX). 5xFAD mice were bred in house on a C57BL/6J background (approved IACUC protocol # 2013–3508). Postmortem human brain tissue was obtained from Northwestern University’s Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease Center (CNADC) (http://www.Brain.northwestern.edu/research/brain/autopsy.html). Briefly, brain fragments of approximately 100 mg (mouse) or 200 mg (human) were homogenized in 20 volumes of Ham’s F12 medium (Caisson Labs) containing protease inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-free, Roche) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The pellet was re-homogenized in 10 volumes of the same medium and centrifuged again. In the case of mouse brains, medium was supplemented with 0.5 % Triton X-100. Supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to remove insoluble material, including fibrils. Protein concentration in the AβO-rich supernatant fractions was determined using the 660 nm protein assay reagent (Pierce).

Sandwich ELISA for brain extracts using phage-bound NUsc1

High-adsorption 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, ThermoFisher Scientific) were coated by overnight incubation with 100 µL of monoclonal anti-pan Aβ antibody (6E10, Covance, RRID AB_2564653) at 1.0 µg/mL in PBS at 4 °C. The next day, the plate was blocked with 200 µL of 2% milk/PBS. Brain extracts were added at 0.5 mg/mL (total protein) diluted in 2% milk/PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS and incubated with phage-bound NUsc1 at 1:100 dilution in 2 % milk/PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-phage M13 (GE). Plates were developed using TMB (Sigma).

Immunohistochemistry

APP/PS1 mice (RRID: MMRRC_034832-JAX) were purchased from Jackson Labs and were bred in house on a C57BL/6J background (approved CEUA/UFRJ protocol # 01200.001568/2013-87). Mice were transcardially perfused with saline followed by fresh 4% formaldehyde. Brains were removed and fixed for 24 h in the same solution, and then embedded in paraffin after dehydration and diaphanization. Sections (10 µm) were immersed in xylene for 10 min, rehydrated, and incubated with 3% H2O2 in methanol. After antigen reactivation by treatment with 0.01 M citrate buffer (40 min at 95°C) and blocking, sections were incubated with phage-bound NUsc1 (1:1 in blocking buffer) overnight at 4°C. Slides were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody for 2 h and incubated with streptavidin–biotin–peroxidase for 30 min. Finally, reactivity was developed using DAB solution (0.06% DAB in PBS containing 2% DMSO and 0.018% H2O2) for 1–5 min. Reaction was stopped by immersion of slides in distilled water. Counterstaining was performed with Harris hematoxilin. Alternatively, immunofluorescence was carried out. In this case, slices were blocked with 3% BSA and incubated for 2 h at RT with Alexa 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000). Slices were mounted on coverslips using Prolong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen) and imaged on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 Microscope equipped with an Apotome module. Postmortem human brain tissue was also used. In this case, autopsied brain sections from AD patients and cognitively normal subjects (Northwestern University CNADC) were immunolabeled as described in (Lacor et al. 2004). Briefly, tissue was fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and transferred to a 10–40% sucrose gradient. Free-floating 40-µm-thick serial sections were obtained from frontal cortex. Sections were rinsed with TBS (20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2 M NaCl), blocked with 5% horse serum in TBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% milk (40 min at RT), and were incubated with phage-bound NUsc1 (1:1), NU1 (1.5 µg/mL; Lambert et al. 2007) or m70 (1.5 µg/mL; Lambert et al., 2001) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then incubated for 90 min at RT with secondary antibodies anti-M13 (GE; 1:250 dilution) and Alexa Fluor anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:500 dilution). Images were acquired on a Nikon T3000 microscope. Sections were counterstained with DAPI. Control sections with primary or secondary antibodies omitted showed no fluorescent signal (not shown).

Statistical analysis

Statistical significance in the difference between population means was determined by the Student’s t-test or a two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test, where indicated. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all cases.

RESULTS

Screening and characterization of anti-Aβ oligomer scFvs

Selection of anti-Aβ oligomer (AβO) scFvs was performed by panning a phage display library of human IgG-derived scFvs (Nissim et al. 1994) against immobilized AβOs. A set of 11 scFvs (henceforth referred to as NUscs) thus isolated was found to efficiently distinguish oligomers from both monomeric and fibrillar Aβ (Fig. 1A). Aβ1–40 was used to prepare monomeric Aβ since it is known to self-assemble into oligomers/fibrils at a much slower rate than Aβ1–42 (e.g., Vandersteen et al. 2012) and would remain predominately monomeric under our experimental conditions. Among the selected NUscs, in the current study we have focused on NUsc1, which we previously reported to target a small subset of synapse-binding AβOs that are &gt;50 kDa in molecular mass (Velasco et al. 2012).

To investigate further the specificity of NUsc1, we asked whether it also reacted with toxic oligomers formed from non-Aβ proteins, as previously demonstrated for other anti-oligomer antibodies such as A11 (Kayed et al. 2003). To this end, neurotoxic lysozyme oligomers were prepared as previously described (Vieira et al. 2007) and the immunoreactivity of phage-bound NUsc1 towards oligomers from Aβ or lysozyme was compared by ELISA. At equal concentrations of Aβ or lysozyme oligomers, NUsc1 detection of AβOs was 75-fold stronger than detection of lysozyme oligomers (Fig. 1B). As expected, measurements with the A11 antibody showed immunoreactivity to both AβOs and lysozyme oligomers, but no binding to lysozyme monomers. The reactivity of NUsc1 towards oligomers from the neuronal protein tau was further investigated using a competition ELISA sandwich assay against cross-linked AβOs. Titration of AβOs in the absence of tau revealed a dose-response curve with an EC50 = 94 nM Aβ for NUsc1 in this assay (Fig. 1C). When the AβO concentration was held constant at 125 nM, addition of increasing concentrations of tau oligomers (TauOs) did not lead to a dose-dependent decrease in signal, indicating no significant binding of TauOs to NUsc1. A tendency to decrease in signal was observed only at the highest concentration of TauOs tested (800 nM). Control measurements showed that the capture antibody, NU2, did not bind monomeric tau or tau oligomers (data not shown).

Phage-free NUsc1 retains its structure and AβO binding activity

NUsc1 was expressed free of bacteriophage using the HB2151 E. coli strain. Expression of intact NUsc1 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Supp. Fig. 1A), which revealed a major protein band migrating between the 25 and 34 kDa standards, in agreement with the expected molecular mass of 28 kDa for human scFvs. Expression of phage-free NUsc1 was further confirmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against the c-myc and 6xHis affinity tags included in the construct (Supp. Fig. 1B).

Because the stability of scFvs is reported to be a common problem (Worn &amp; Pluckthun 2001), the aggregation state of phage-free NUsc1 was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Figure 2A shows that phage-free NUsc1 elutes as a single peak corresponding to a molecular mass of 24 kDa in the calibrated column, in agreement with the expected molecular mass for the scFv.

The AβO-binding capacity of phage-free NUsc1 was analyzed next. Dot immunoblotting revealed that phage-free NUsc1 retained AβO binding activity (Fig. 2B). Compared to the full-length anti-AβO monoclonal antibody NU2 (Lambert et al., 2007), however, NUsc1 yielded a weaker signal and a higher detection limit. Analysis of AβO binding activity by ELISA showed dose-dependent signals as a function of the concentrations of both AβOs (Fig. 2C) and phage-free NUsc1 (Fig. 2D). Fitting the data with a 4-parameter non-linear binding equation yielded an EC50 of 20 pmol AβOs (Fig. 2C) and 123 µg/mL NUsc1 (Fig. 2D). Each of the assays presented in Figure 2 was conducted with phage-free NUsc1 that had been stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month. This indicates that phage-free NUsc1 is stable during at least this time frame.

NUsc1 detects AβOs bound to neurons in culture

We next examined whether NUsc1 targets neuron-bound AβOs. Indeed, phage-bound NUsc1 labeled AβOs that had been previously added and were bound to cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3, right). The punctate dendritic labeling pattern obtained with NUsc1 closely resembles the pattern obtained using our AβO-selective polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (Lambert et al. 2007, Lambert et al. 2001) and indicates targeting of AβOs bound to synapses. No dendritic binding was detected by NUsc1 in vehicle-exposed cultures (Fig. 3, left). A combination of phage-bound NUsc1-based immunofluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy clearly showed NUsc1 targeting of AβOs bound to dendrites (Fig. 3D). By contrast, no AβO-dependent labeling was observed in cultures labeled with phage-bound NUsc16, an scFv that shows no interaction with AβOs by ELISA (data not shown).

NUsc1 detects AβOs in Tg mouse brain

Next, we investigated the capacity of NUsc1 to recognize AβOs in brain extracts from two distinct mouse models of AD. Phage-bound NUsc1 reacted with Aβ oligomers in fixed brain sections from APP/PS1 mice (Jankowsky et al. 2004) (Fig. 4A), as detected by both immunofluorescence (left) and DAB staining (right). Little-to-no signal due to NUsc1 was observed in WT mouse brains (Fig. 4A). Phage-bound NUsc1 also readily discriminated brain extracts from 5xFAD (Oakley et al. 2006) or WT mice in an ELISA assay, similar to the polyclonal anti-AβO IgG m70 (Lambert et al. 2001) (Fig. 4B).

NUsc1 detects AβOs in AD brain

The capacity of NUsc1 to detect AβOs in AD brain was investigated. Donors were male and diagnosed with either probable or definitive AD based on the CERAD score. The ability of NUsc1 to detect AβOs in fixed slices from AD or control brains was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Strong AD-dependent reactivity of phage-bound NUsc1 was observed, with intensity of labeling increasing with patient diagnosis from probable to definitive AD (Fig 5A–C). In addition, NUsc1 discriminated between brain extracts from age-matched, non-demented controls and the majority of AD subjects in an ELISA assay (Fig. 5D). The lack of significant interaction of NUsc1 with Tau oligomers (Fig. 1C) indicates that the labeling seen in AD brain, where Tau aggregates are expected to be present, is indeed derived from Aβ aggregates.

Neuroprotection by NUsc1

Based on its capacity to bind AβOs in Tg mouse and AD brains, as well as in vitro, the ability of NUsc1 to block AβO-elicited neurotoxicity was examined. Neuroprotection by NUsc1 was tested by analyzing its capacity to block or reduce AβO-induced toxic events in rat hippocampal neurons, namely excessive ROS accumulation (De Felice et al. 2007, De Felice et al. 2009) and tau hyperphosphorylation (De Felice et al. 2008). While cultures challenged with AβOs presented a robust increase in ROS levels compared to vehicle-treated cultures (Fig. 6A–B), pre-incubation with phage-bound NUsc1 significantly reduced AβO-induced ROS accumulation (Fig. 6C). Control measurements showed lack of oxidative stress induced by NUsc1 itself (Fig. 6D).

Similar results were obtained by measuring AβO-induced tau hyperphosphorylation. Hippocampal cultures challenged with AβOs presented a 2-fold increase in levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) (Fig. 7). Pre-incubation with phage-free NUsc1 completely blocked AβO-induced p-tau. Importantly, post-treatment total cell counting revealed that phage-free NUsc1 itself did not instigate cell death in this assay (data not shown). These results strongly support the notion that NUsc1 neutralizes toxic AβOs in solution.

NUsc1 targets a subset of AβOs

Finally, to identify the AβO species detected by NUsc1, AβOs were fractionated by SEC and fractions were probed for NUsc1 immunoreactivity by dot immunoblotting. NUsc1 predominantly reacted with high molecular weight AβOs (above 60 kDa; Fig 8A). Interestingly, specific detection of a subpopulation of AβOs with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (corresponding to a single eluted fraction at ~2.3 mL) was also evident. Presence of low molecular weight oligomers (showing as a robust peak centered at an elution volume of ~ 2.6 mL) in the AβO preparation was confirmed by NU1 detection. Low molecular weight oligomers reacted weakly with NUsc1.

The AβO size-dependence of NUsc1 immunoreactivity was further evaluated in an immunoprecipitation assay using purified, phage-free NUsc1-functionalized magnetic beads, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 8B). Functionalization of the beads with NUsc1 was confirmed by the presence of a ~30 kDa band, similar to the NUsc1 standard. Note that no 30 kDa band was present in beads not functionalized with NUsc1. Before incubation with NUsc1-functionalized beads, AβOs were fractionated by centrifugal filtration through a 50 kDa MWCO membrane. AβOs in the resulting filtrate (F; &lt; 50 kDa species) or retentate (R; &gt; 50 kDa) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 8B). Bands corresponding to Aβ, identified by comparison with a synthetic AβO standard (shown in the right-hand side of the gel as 3–4 bands ranging from &lt; 10 to ~ 20 kDa) were only detected in the retentate, substantiating the previous observation that NUsc1 preferentially targets AβOs larger than 50 kDa (Velasco et al. 2012). Importantly, Aβ-associated bands were not present in the filtrate, indicating a lack of interaction of NUsc1 with low molecular weight oligomers (&lt; 50 kDa), in agreement with the SEC data in Figure 8A and previously published work (Velasco et al. 2012).

DISCUSSION

In the present study, multiple human scFvs, termed NUscs, have been identified that effectively distinguish oligomers of the Aβ1–42 peptide (AβOs) from the less toxic forms of Aβ, monomers and fibrils. One of those NUscs, NUsc1, was specific for an epitope present in Aβ oligomers but not common to generic amyloid oligomers, such as oligomers formed from lysozyme or Tau. We further demonstrated that, in addition to the phage-bound form, Nusc1 can be expressed as a stable, functional scFv devoid of the bacteriophage vector. NUsc1 was shown to target AβOs in AD and AD model systems, and to prevent the neurotoxicity of AβOs to hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, NUsc1 appears specific for a small subpopulation of toxic AβOs.

The current identification of 11 Aβ conformation-specific scFvs represents an extension of our previous work with Aβ conformation-specific scFvs (Wang et al. 2009, Velasco et al. 2012) and full-length IgGs (Lambert et al. 2007). Other groups have developed Aβ conformation-specific scFvs (Meli et al. 2009, Meli et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2016). Solomon and colleagues presented the first example with scFvs specific for Aβ fibrils (Frenkel et al. 2000). Those scFvs, expressed by phage-display, were able to engage Aβ plaques in the brains of mice when introduced through intranasal injection (Frenkel &amp; Solomon 2002, Solomon &amp; Frenkel 2002, Solomon 2008). In another notable example, Sierks and colleagues presented multiple scFvs targeting variants of AβOs that are differentially expressed in AD brain, CSF and serum (Zameer et al. 2008, Kasturirangan et al. 2012, Kasturirangan et al. 2013, Williams et al. 2016). It is becoming increasingly apparent that, for greatest efficacy, Aβ-directed immunotherapies must target only the most toxic Aβ species, so as to prevent off-target engagement of the antibodies and/or undesirable side effects. This is evident from reports showing that Aβ immunotherapies employing antibodies with significant affinities for less toxic Aβ species, including monomers and fibrils, consistently exhibit amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA; vasogenic edema and microhemorrhages) (Farlow &amp; Brosch 2013, Sevigny et al. 2016, Goure et al. 2014).

The specificity of NUsc1 for an epitope specific to oligomers of Aβ, and not general amyloid oligomers, is significant in that it increases its utility for AD-related studies. Other antibodies have been shown to target an epitope shared by oligomers formed from different amyloid proteins, such as the A11 antibody developed by Glabe and colleagues (Kayed et al. 2003). In addition to AβOs, A11 is known to detect soluble oligomers implicated in multiple diseases, including α-synuclein (Parkinson’s disease), islet amyloid polypeptide (type II diabetes), polyglutamine (Huntington’s disease), and the prion protein (spongiform encephalopathies). In the present study, we found that NUsc1 does not bind significantly to oligomers from either lysozyme or Tau. These findings are significant for the following reasons. First, in the case of lysozyme, although not a mammalian neural protein, soluble oligomers formed in vitro are well characterized, measuring about 10 nm, thus somewhat larger than high molecular mass AβOs (~ 3.5 nm; Sebollela et al. 2014) and are neurotoxic (Vieira et al. 2007). Secondly, tau oligomers are relevant because of their increasingly recognized role in AD pathology (e.g., Patterson et al. 2011). Along with the observation that the NUsc1 binding pattern to both AβO-treated neurons (Fig. 3) and AD human tissue (Fig. 5) is mostly peri-neuronal and closely resembles the patterns obtained using other anti-AβO IgGs such as NU4 (Lambert et al. 2007, Lacor et al. 2007), our findings lead us to conclude that NUsc1 preferentially targets AβOs. While pan-amyloid antibodies have great utility in studying common pathogenic mechanisms in the corresponding amyloid diseases, they cannot be useful in distinguishing between specific neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, we show that Nusc1 can be expressed as a stable, functional scFv antibody free of its bacteriophage vector. Analysis by SEC showed phage-free NUsc1 to be monodisperse. Its ability to bind AβOs was confirmed in dose-response dot immunoblotting and ELISA assays. This binding activity was retained for at least 1 month of storage at 4 °C. The stability of phage-free NUsc1 is significant as scFvs are known to be prone to aggregation or cleavage at the flexible linker connecting the variable domains (Worn &amp; Pluckthun 2001, Frenkel et al. 2000, Rivera-Hernandez et al. 2013, Cheng et al. 2016). Free from the large bacteriophage, soluble scFvs may have greater utility than their phage-bound counterparts in experiments designed for high-resolution structural characterization of their targets.

The relevance of NUsc1 targeted oligomers to AD was established in the present study. This is shown by the fact that NUsc1 reacts with AβOs in both AD brain extracts and in fixed AD brain tissue, but not in control brain slices or extracts. It is important to note that NUscs were initially selected for their specificities towards a synthetic preparation of AβOs (Lambert et al. 1998, Chromy et al. 2003). The fact that NUsc1 recognizes AβOs in AD brain further strengthens previous observations that this synthetic preparation of oligomers is indeed AD-relevant (Gong et al. 2003).

The notion that NUsc1 targets AD-relevant oligomer species is further supported by results in AD model systems. In culture, NUsc1 detected synthetic AβOs previously bound to neurons in a punctate pattern along dendrites, similar to previous observations using anti-AβO IgGs and suggesting that the AβOs targeted by NUsc1 bind synapses (Lacor et al. 2007). In both Tg mouse and AD brain, the pattern of NUsc1 labeling is similar to the labeling obtained using full-IgG AβO antibodies to diffuse plaques, which are distinct from dense core plaques (Viola et al. 2015). As previously noted, this diffuse binding pattern is suggestive of NUsc1 binding to neuronal dendritic arbors (Ferreira &amp; Klein, 2011). Furthermore, NUsc1 was found to reduce ROS accumulation in AβO-exposed cultured neurons. Here it is important to mention that although ROS production is physiological under certain levels/circumstances (e.g., Sena &amp; Chandel 2012), excessive ROS production is toxic to most cells, and is a toxic event implicated in the pathogenesis of AD (Perry et al. 2002) and known to be induced by AβOs (De Felice et al. 2007, De Felice et al. 2009). We have also demonstrated that NUsc1 completely blocked tau hyperphosphorylation induced by AβOs in cultured neurons. Taken together, these data support the notion that NUsc1 targets AD-relevant AβOs.

An interesting property of NUsc1 is its apparent specificity for a small subpopulation of AβOs. This specificity was first apparent in a previous study, in which NUsc1 was found to target a subset of AβOs that are greater than 50 kDa in molecular mass and bind to synapses in cultured neurons (Velasco et al. 2012). Data in the current study further substantiate these conclusions. In dot immunoblotting assays, NUsc1 detected a subset of AβO species detected by the full-IgG anti-AβO monoclonal antibody NU2. In an immunoprecipitation assay, only AβOs greater than 50 kDa were co-precipitated with NUsc1. Using SEC, NUsc1 was found to recognize AβO species in fractions greater, but not less, than 60 kDa. This is in contrast to NU1 targeting SEC fractions of AβOs both larger and smaller than 60 kDa. Importantly, the SEC and immunoblotting assays were performed under non-denaturing conditions, crucial to allow identification of AD-relevant AβO species. Data regarding NUsc1 specificity towards oligomers of particular sizes support previously published data indicating that AβO targets of NUsc1 are larger than 50 kDa (Velasco et al. 2012).

Altogether, we show here that the human scFv NUsc1 targets AβOs that are larger than 60 kDa in non-denaturing conditions and appear to be AD relevant, i.e., they are present in AD and Tg mouse brains, bind neuronal synapses, and induce excessive ROS accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in neuronal culture. According to these observations, we propose that the oligomer targets of NUsc1 are a subset of “Type I” AβOs (Liu et al. 2015). In addition, we predict that NUsc1 may be useful in phage-free form to isolate and stabilize this particular Type I AβO subspecies for future high-resolution structural studies, e.g., cryo-electron microscopy or X-ray crystallography.

It is further possible that other NUscs, amongst the 11 identified in our biopanning screen, target different AβO species from NUsc1. If this turns out to be the case, those NUscs, in addition to NUsc1, would be quite valuable to characterize AβO structure-neurotoxicity relationships, as well as for differential AD diagnostics and therapeutics, given that distinct AβO species have been found to be differentially expressed in brain and CSF throughout AD progression (Bao et al. 2012, Lesne et al. 2013). In this regard, NUscs may prove powerful diagnostic imaging probes. We recently demonstrated the diagnostic utility of our AβO-specific monoclonal antibody NU4 as an MRI imaging probe in Tg mice (Viola et al. 2015). Further characterization of NUsc1 and NUscs2–11 is thus warranted to determine their potentials as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in AD.

Figure 1 Specific binding of NUscs to Aβ oligomers

(A) Aβ monomers, fibrils or AβOs (10 µg/mL) were immobilized on microplate wells and probed by ELISA with either pan anti-Aβ antibody (6E10; Covance) or scFvs (NUscs). No reactivity to the vehicle control was detected for 6E10 or any of the NUscs (not shown). (B) ELISA detection of lysozyme monomers (LysM) or oligomers (LysO) using NUsc1 (blue bars) or anti-amyloid oligomer antibody A11 (Kayed et al., 2003; red bars). Antigen concentration for NUsc1 was 10 nM, while A11 detection was carried out with 333 nM AβOs and 1 mM lysozyme (monomeric or oligomeric). The increase in antigen concentration for A11 was necessary to detect its expected preference for oligomeric over monomeric lysozyme. Bars correspond to averages +/− S.D for absorbance values in triplicate samples. (C) Competition ELISA sandwich assay to compare NUsc1 affinity for oligomers of Aβ or tau (TauOs). As a positive control for AβO binding, AβOs were titrated in the range from 16 to 1000 nM in the absence of tau (blue). The data was fit by a 4-parameter non-linear binding equation (4PL), yielding an EC50 of 94 nM AβOs. To compare affinities, AβOs were held constant at 125 nM and tau was varied from 25–800 nM (orange). The NUsc1 response to 125 nM AβOs in the absence of tau is indicated by a dashed line. Error bars represent standard error of the mean from duplicates.

Figure 2 Phage-free NUsc1 is monomeric and retains AβO binding activity

NUsc1 was expressed free of bacteriophage using the HB2151 E. coli strain. (A) Apparent molecular mass and aggregation state of phage-free NUsc1 were assessed by SEC. (B) AβO binding activity of phage-free NUsc1 was confirmed using dot immunoblotting. AβO-selective monoclonal antibody NU2 (Lambert et al. 2007) was included for comparison. AβO binding activity was further confirmed in dose-response ELISA assays where the concentration of either AβOs (C) or NUsc1 (D) was varied. A 4-parameter non-linear binding equation was fit to the data in both plots, yielding an EC50 of 20 pmol AβOs (C) and 123 µg/mL NUsc1 (D). Error bars represent standard error of the mean from triplicates.

Figure 3 NUsc1 detects AβOs bound to cultured hippocampal neurons

Primary hippocampal neuronal cultures were exposed to vehicle (A) or 250 nM AβOs (B) for 15 min. Unbound AβOs were washed away and cells were probed with phage-bound NUsc1 (green). DAPI was used to visualize nuclei (blue). Scale bar = 20 µm. Overlaid DIC and fluorescence images from an independent culture treated with vehicle (C) or 100 nM AβOs (D) are also presented. Fluorescence images were labeled as described above. Scale bar = 20 µm.

Figure 4 NUsc1 detects AβOs in AD mouse brain

(A) Detection of AβOs in APP/PS1 mouse brain by NUsc1. Hippocampal sections from transgenic (Tg) or WT mice were probed with phage-bound NUsc1 and imaged at low (left, epifluorescence) or high (right, DAB) magnification. Scale bars correspond to 200 µm (left, white bar) or 50 µm (right, black bar). (B) Extracts (frontal cortex) were prepared from 5xFAD mice or wild type (WT) littermates. ELISA sandwich assays were carried out using 6E10 as capture antibody and phage-bound NUsc1 as the detection antibody. Bars represent means +/− SEM of results from extracts from at least 3 mice in each group. Difference between WT and 5xFAD mice extracts was statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.05, Student’s t-test) and larger than the difference obtained using polyclonal anti-AβO IgG m70.

Scale bar = 50 µm. (D) Extracts (frontal cortex) were prepared from frozen postmortem human brain tissue obtained from independent donors. ELISA sandwich assays were carried out using 6E10 for capture and phage-bound NUsc1 for detection. Control = non-demented age-matched donors. Horizontal lines indicate mean values for each group (n = 3–4 donors/group).

Figure 6 NUsc1 alleviates AβO-induced excessive ROS accumulation in hippocampal neurons

Hippocampal cultures were exposed to vehicle (A), 500 nM AβOs (B), AβOs + NUsc1 (C) or NUsc1 alone (D) for 3 h. NUsc1 (phage-bound, diluted 10x in culture medium) was added immediately before AβOs. ROS levels were determined using the ROS-sensitive probe DCFDA, as described (De Felice et al., 2007). (E) Averaged integrated fluorescence determined from two experiments in triplicate. *p-value &lt; 0.05 (two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test).

Figure 7 NUsc1 blocks AβO-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in hippocampal neurons

Cultures were exposed to either vehicle, 500 nM AβOs, or 500 nM AβOs + 25 µg/mL NUsc1 for 5 h. Tau phosphorylation levels were evaluated using an antibody against tau phosphorylated at residue T205. Signal was quantified by pixel area above an intensity threshold and normalized to cell number. Error bar represents standard error of the mean (n = 25 images per group covering 354 × 354 µm). *p-value &lt; 0.005 (Student’s t-test). Scale bar = 25 µm.

Figure 8 NUsc1 selectively targets a subset of AβOs

(A) NUsc1 and NU1 immunoreactivities (detected using a dot immunoblot assay) to AβO fractions separated by SEC-HPLC on a GPC100 column. Apparent MWs corresponding to fractions of interest were estimated based on a calibration curve constructed using six protein standards ranging from 13 to 200 kDa. Elution volumes for three of those MW standards and the column void volume (as determined by elution of plasmid DNA) are indicated by arrows. (B) AβOs were fractionated by filtration using a 50 kDa MWCO filter and subjected to immunoprecipitation using phage-free NUsc1-functionalized magnetic beads. Filtrate (F, &lt; 50 kDa) or retentate (R, &gt; 50 kDa) were incubated with NUsc1-functionalized or non-functionalized (control) magnetic beads. Presence of Aβ bound to beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Control lanes containing either purified NUsc1 or unfractionated AβOs (“standards”) were included to facilitate identification of individual bands.
