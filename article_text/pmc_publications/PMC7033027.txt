Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) - related neuropathology, characterized by amyloid plaques with amyloid β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles with tau accumulation. Peripheral inflammation and the innate immune response are elevated in DS. Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) genetic variants are risk factors for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. A soluble cleavage product of TREM2 (sTREM2) is elevated in AD cerebrospinal fluid and positively correlates with cognitive decline. There is relatively little information about TREM2 in DS. Our objective was to examine the relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory markers in young adults with DS, prior to the development of dementia symptoms. Since TREM2 plays a role in the innate immune response and has been associated with dementia, the hypothesis of this exploratory study was that young adults with DS pre-dementia (n=15, mean age 29.5 years) would exhibit a different relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory markers in plasma, compared to neurotypical, age-matched controls (n=16, mean age 29.6 years). Indeed, young adults with DS had significantly elevated plasma sTREM2 and inflammatory markers. Additionally, in young adults with DS, sTREM2 correlated positively with 24 of the measured cytokines, while there were no significant correlations in the control group. Hierarchical clustering of sTREM2 and cytokine concentrations also differed between the groups, supporting the hypothesis that its function is altered in people with DS pre-dementia. This preliminary report of human plasma provides a basis for future studies investigating the relationship between TREM2 and the broader immune response pre-dementia.

1. Introduction

In the last half of the 20th century, the life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome (DS) has increased to 60 years 1–3, highlighting the importance of understanding age-related disease in this population 4. Most individuals with DS carry three full copies of chromosome 21. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, located on chromosome 21, is processed into amyloid-β (Aβ). The overabundance of Aβ resulting from three copies of APP leads to Aβ plaque deposition in about 50% of people with DS over age 30 and subsequently increases their risk for dementia in middle age (around age 40) 5,6. The study of early adulthood in DS potentially provides a unique model for the early biology of AD in the general population.

Assessment of subtle cognitive changes is challenging in DS, partly because of the presence and variability of intellectual disability 7,8. Therefore, defining biomarkers of dementia progression are critical in this population of individuals. AD neuropathology, amyloid and tau, accumulates early in DS, and plasma Aβ and tau represent potential biomarker candidates 9–11. In DS, the variable severity of Aβ deposition within age groups and age of onset of dementia suggest that factors other than the presence of triplication of the APP gene contribute to the timing and severity of amyloid deposition and therefore the onset of AD 5,12–14.

Biomarkers of peripheral inflammation and the innate immune response are elevated in DS 15–18. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) is a pattern recognition receptor that can be activated by both pathogen- and danger- associated molecular patterns in the innate immune response 19,20. Loss-of-function genetic variants in TREM2, located on chromosome 6, are risk factors for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases 21–23. The soluble cleavage product of TREM2 (sTREM2) is elevated in AD cerebrospinal fluid and positively correlates with Aβ and cognitive decline 24–32. There is relatively little information about TREM2 in DS, though one group describes elevated TREM2 protein levels in young adults and declining levels with aging 33,34.

The hypothesis of this investigation was that there is a relationship between soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) and inflammatory markers in DS, prior to the development of dementia symptoms. We found that young adults with Down syndrome displayed an altered immune profile compared to neurotypical controls, with increased levels of sTREM2 and inflammatory markers in plasma. In young adults with DS, sTREM2 correlated positively with 24 of the 38 measured cytokines, while there were no significant correlations in the control group. In addition, sTREM2 clustered with different cytokines in the two groups. The results of this preliminary report implicate an altered relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory markers in young adults with DS pre-dementia.

2. Material and Methods

2.1 Study Design

Fifteen young adults with DS (mean age 29.5 years, range 26–34 years; 5 females) and 16 neurotypical age-matched controls (mean age 29.6 years, range 25–36 years; 4 females) were enrolled in the study under a protocol approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. We have reviewed the medical histories of the participants, and found that none have reported systemic inflammatory diseases or known infections at the time of enrollment. No participants reported use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which could have impacted their cytokine profiles. For participants with DS, inclusion criteria included a medical diagnosis of DS, age 25–35 years, and the ability to assent to participation and complete the study procedures. Participants were excluded for a history of major neurological or psychiatric illness other than DS or documented symptoms of dementia. Participants with DS provided verbal or written informed assent as appropriate, and their guardians provided written informed consent. Control participants provided written informed consent. Biospecimens were collected and processed through the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Biobank (LRCBH-Biobank). Prior to additional study interventions, participants with DS underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment in order to minimize the chance of including participants that were showing subtle signs of dementia. This assessment was completed by a psychiatrist specializing in developmental disabilities, and included a psychiatric diagnostic interview with participant and caregiver, medical history, and mental status examination 35. Participant caregivers also completed the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID) 36 and the Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities (DLD) 37. No participants were judged to be showing signs of dementia.

2.2 Complete Blood Counts

Venipunctures were performed for the collection of whole blood, and plasma was isolated from lavender-top EDTA tubes. Complete blood counts (CBC) were performed on most participants (n=14 DS and n=15 controls) via microscopy by trained technicians blinded to sample group.

2.3 APOE4 genotyping

APOE4 genotyping was performed from blood samples using the 7500 Real Time PCR System and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (rs429358, rs7412) (Thermo Fisher) as previously described 38.

2.4 Plasma Biomarkers

Plasma soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels were measured using a Luminex 200 3.1 xPONENT System (EMD Millipore, Chicago, IL, USA) and a custom detection method designed to capture the soluble portion of TREM2 protein as previously described 27. Briefly, a capture antibody bound to MagPlex beads binds sTREM2 (R&amp;D #MAB1828 human TREM2 antibody monoclonal mouse IgG2B Clone #263602; Immunogen His19-Ser174). A biotinylated antibody with a SAPE conjugate was used for detection (R&amp;D: #BAF1828; human TREM2 biotinylated antibody; antigen affinity-purified polyclonal goat IgG; Immunogen His19-Ser174). Inflammatory markers were measured with a human cytokine/chemokine panel utilizing Luminex 200 xMap technology and the MILLIPLEX MAP ® multiplex kits (Luminex xMAP technology; EMD Millipore, Chicago, IL, USA: HNABTMAG-68K and HCYTMAG60PMX41BK, respectively) following the manufacturer’s instructions for analyte detection in human plasma. The inflammatory markers in the panel were: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF-2), eotaxin, Transforming Growth Factor alpha (TGF-α), Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L), Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), Fractalkine (also known as CX3CL1), interferon (IFN) alpha 2 (IFNα2), IFNγ, growth-regulated oncogene (GRO), interleukin (IL) 10, (IL-10), Monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3, also known as CCL7), IL-12 40kDa (IL-12p40), Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), IL-12 70kDa (IL-12P70), IL-13, IL-15, soluble CD40-ligand (sCD40L), IL-17A, IL-1 receptor agonist (IL-1RA), IL-1α, IL-9, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10), MCP-1 (also known as CCL2), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1α (MIP-1α also known as CCL3), MIP-1β (also known as CCL4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha (TNFα), TNFβ), and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).

2.5 Statistical Analyses

DS and control demographics were compared using unpaired t-test for age and Fisher’s exact test for APOE4 status and sex distribution. Plasma sTREM2 and inflammatory markers were measured in plasma on plates that also contained buffer-alone background wells (containing zero pg/ml of each protein) and standard curve wells containing known concentrations of each protein measured. Concentrations of analytes were determined based on fluorescence of the standard curves for the respective proteins. Concentration values were log10 transformed for comparison. Values below fluorescence levels of the background wells were considered to be physiologically zero pg/ml, and set equal to 0.001pg/ml in order to be able to log transform the data. Individual plasma samples were run in duplicate on two different plates, and the overall mean of the 4 replicates was determined. Replicates with a high coefficient of variation (&gt;30%) were analyzed to identify outliers, which were then removed from the analysis. CBC, biomarker, and inflammatory marker data were compared between groups using unpaired t-tests, and false discovery rates (FDR) were determined using the Original FDR method of Benjamini and Hochberg, with Q = 1%. Linear regression was used to determine correlations between analytes using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Correlograms were made using the “corrplot” function in the corrplot package 39 and arranged according to hierarchical clustering using the Ward’s method in R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Heat maps, including hierarchical clustering with the Ward’s method, were produced using the “heatmap.2” function in the gplots package 40 in R 3.6.1. Data were scaled using the “scale” function in R prior to input into the “corrplot” and “heatmap.2” functions. All other data analysis utilized GraphPad Prism version 8.1.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

3. Results

3.1 Cohort characteristics

Young adults with DS did not differ significantly from neurotypical controls in terms of age (mean 29.5 years vs. 29.6 years, p=0.89), distribution of sex (33.3% vs. 25.0%, p=0.70) or presence of the AD risk allele APOE4 (13.3% vs. 18.8%, p&gt;0.99) (Table I).

3.2 Complete blood counts and inflammatory markers

Plasma sTREM2 was significantly elevated in DS compared to neurotypical controls (p=0.000966) (Figure 1A). Markers of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were compared; CRP was elevated in DS (p=0.0169) and ESR trended toward being elevated in DS (p=0.05098) compared to controls (Figure 1B–C). Participants with DS had significantly higher percentages of basophils (p=0.000185) and trended towards higher percentages of neutrophils (p=0.087), compared to controls, while percentages of lymphocytes and monocytes did not differ between groups (Figure 1D). Participants with DS had fewer lymphocytes (p=0.037) and more basophils (p=0.001) compared to controls (Figure 1E) when comparing cell counts.

3.3 Levels of Plasma sTREM2 and Plasma Inflammatory Markers in Down Syndrome Pre-dementia

Given prior observations of elevated peripheral immune factors 15,16,18,41 and our own finding of elevated sTREM2 in DS, we addressed the question of whether other plasma inflammatory markers (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) were elevated in our DS cohort using an immune profiling panel. Inflammatory markers were grouped based on known function into the general categories “pro-inflammatory”, “immunoregulatory/ pleiotropic”, and “anti-inflammatory” 42–51. Values below assay background levels were determined to be physiologically zero pg/ml, and set = 0.001 pg/ml for the purpose of log transformation and analysis. Out of the 38 factors tested, 32 were significantly higher in DS compared to age-matched controls (Figure 2A–B); the exceptions were IL-4, FGF-2, MDC, IL-17A, GRO, and MCP-1. In order to determine if it was valid to set values below background equal to 0.001, we repeated the analysis after removing all values that had been below background detection levels (Supplemental Figure 1A). We found that 30/38 cytokines were significantly higher in DS compared to controls; the exceptions were IL-13, G-CSF, IL-6, MDC, IL-17A, GRO, sCD40L, and MCP-1 (Supplemental Figure 1AB).

3.4 The Relationship between Peripheral sTREM2 and Peripheral Inflammatory Markers

Pearson correlations were plotted and the correlation matrix was clustered based on the Ward’s method of least variance. Importantly, sTREM2 showed statistically significant correlations only in the group with DS, and in each instance the correlations were positive. We observed significant positive correlations with sTREM2 and 24/38 measured cytokines in the DS group (MDC, sCD40L, TNFα, TGF α, IFNα2, IL-6, Flt-3L, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-12p70, IFNγ, MIP-1β, IL-17A, VEGF, IL-5, eotaxin, IL-8, IL-3, IL-4, IL-12p40, IL-9, IL-7, Il-10, and IL-15), and 0/38 measured cytokines in the control group (Figure 3A–B, Pearson correlation coefficients (r) and p-values are shown in Supplemental Table I). Additionally, the clustering showed distinctly different patterns in neurotypical controls compared to the DS group (Figure 3A–B).

To further investigate this relationship, hierarchical clustering of the scaled log10 transformed immune factor concentration values was performed on each group. Lower sTREM2 levels in neurotypical controls (Figure 1A) clustered closest to GRO, Flt-3L, MDC, and IP-10, while higher sTREM2 in the DS group (Figure 1A) clustered with MDC, sCD40L, and TNFα (Figure 4A–B).

4. Discussion

In this preliminary report, we found evidence of peripheral inflammation and elevated sTREM2 in a group of young adults with DS without symptoms of dementia. These participants with DS had increased levels of anti-inflammatory, proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines compared to neurotypical controls, which cannot be explained by known acute or autoimmune illnesses in our cohort. In fact, the DS participants had lower levels of lymphocytes compared to controls. While the observed basophilia has been reported in DS 52, significantly decreased lymphocyte count and elevated (or trending towards elevated) neutrophils has been reported in AD 53,54.

Plasma sTREM2 was significantly elevated in DS; interestingly, sTREM2 is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in the mild cognitive impairment stage of AD and in early onset forms of AD, but not in peripheral biofluids, such as plasma 24,25,27,28,55. The elevation of sTREM2 in young DS pre-dementia in plasma (Figure 1A) suggests that peripheral sTREM2 may increase very early in individuals with elevated Aβ. Our previous work showed a relationship between plasma sTREM2 and CRP in AD-related mild cognitive impairment (pre-dementia). 27 This was not observed in this DS pre-dementia cohort. This discrepancy may be related to differing stages of AD-related progression in DS pre-dementia compared to AD-related mild cognitive impairment. An important next study would be to compare peripheral sTREM2 in adults with DS pre-dementia to adults with DS and dementia. These future analyses would help elucidate the role of the innate immunity in the variable age-at-onset of dementia in DS. Additionally, it would be helpful to include other neurotypical control groups, such as APOE ε4 non-carriers at low risk for AD, or individuals with systemic inflammatory diseases that are not associated with dementia.

We observed elevated cytokines in the group with DS compared to the neurotypical group. Our findings were similar to another study that found elevated TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 in adults with DS pre-dementia 15. Interestingly, this previous report predicted AD development when these inflammatory markers were combined with measures of Aβ 15. In further support of our findings, another report describes increased IL-6, VEGF-A, MCP-1, IL-22, and TNFα in adults aged 20–65 with DS 56. In contrast, a previous study of adults (mean age 30 years in DS and controls) found elevated serum MIP-1α, but not IFNγ, TNFα, MIP-1β, RANTES, or IL-6 57. The similarities across these studies and our own preliminary report support the notion that in general the immune response is altered in DS, which may contribute to the development of AD.

Our novel finding was that sTREM2 differed in its clustering and correlation patterns between neurotypical and DS groups. Hierarchical clustering linked sTREM2 to different inflammatory markers within the control and DS groups. Because the controls had lower levels of sTREM2, a logical conclusion is that they had more functional, membrane-bound TREM2, an important immune factor for normal innate immunity function 19,20. This remains to be determined, but may have important implications for the cluster analysis results observed. The clustering of sTREM2 with Flt-3L and GRO in neurotypical controls (Figure 4A) is novel information and interesting because Flt-3L is important for proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. Knockout mice models have shown that it is crucial for the development of hematopoietic progenitor cells, B cells, and dendritic cells 58,59. Flt-3L was elevated in our DS pre-dementia cohort, suggesting that normally the role of TREM2 cleavage and consequent production of sTREM2 may be related to Flt-3L activity. Although GRO grouped with sTREM2 in controls, it was not significantly elevated in our DS cohort suggesting a weaker role in DS than Flt-3L. GRO is expressed in monocytes and neutrophils and has proinflammatory and mitogenic functions 60,61, and may have an important TREM2-related role in normal innate immunity function. TREM2 is similarly involved in cell proliferation, specifically of microglia and macrophages through an interaction with the adapter protein DNAX activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) 62.

In contrast, elevated sTREM2 in the DS group clustered with TNFα, sCD40L, and MDC (Figure 4B). While MDC had a similar concentration in both the DS and control groups, TNFα and sCD40L were significantly elevated in DS. TNFα is an acute-phase cytokine secreted by cells including activated macrophages and brain microglial, which also express TREM2 58,63,64. TNFα has been implicated in AD pathology numerous times and is reportedly associated with AD progression 65,66. Soluble CD40 ligand (CD154) is an inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated platelets. It has been shown to be elevated in early AD and there is evidence that it contributes to disease progression 67–69. Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC, or CCL22) is expressed by activated T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and monocytes, and has chemoattractant and inflammatory properties 70. Few studies to date have looked at MDC in the context of AD, but one study found that levels of MDC in CSF decreased after one year of resveratrol treatment in AD compared to the placebo group 71, which may implicate MDC in neuroinflammatory pathways. Together, it was clear that people with DS had an altered relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory markers, which could be contributing to the accelerated onset of AD in this population.

This is a preliminary report that is limited by the small sample size and potential for false negative results. DS biomarker studies, including our study, are limited by samples size and should be considered with caution until replicated in larger populations 10,15,72,73. Covariates such as age and APOE4 status did not differ between our two groups but are important to control for in larger future studies. Another limitation of this study is that karyotypes were not available for the DS participants. Although unlikely, given the unique clinical presentation of these two types of patients, it is possible that some of the DS participants had mosaic DS or chromosome 21 translocations, rather than full trisomy 21. This could lead to heterogeneity of the subjects. Additionally, we were not able to collect CSF from these subjects. CSF has been studied more in-depth in AD studies compared to plasma, and could lend additional evidence of the contribution of sTREM2 and the observed immune state in DS. Furthermore, inclusion of DS with dementia was beyond the limits of this preliminary report. However, future studies of progressive changes in inflammatory markers in not only young adults with DS pre-dementia, but also DS of multiple ages, including children with DS and DS with dementia, will greatly enhance our understanding of the role of inflammation in progressive neurodegeneration.

The results of this preliminary report strongly suggest a relationship between plasma sTREM2 and inflammatory markers in DS pre-dementia. We observed significantly elevated inflammatory markers in DS, in agreement with previous reports 16,18,41,74. Notably, we observed a strong positive correlation between many of the tested immune factors and sTREM2 in the group with DS that was not observed in controls. Given that our cohort of young adults with DS were all pre-dementia, these observed correlations with sTREM2 may be early predictors of dementia onset. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a correlation between sTREM2 and multiple inflammatory markers in DS. This novel result is supported by previously described dysregulation of the immune response in DS 16,18,41,74 and suggests that TREM2 plays a role in the peripheral immune response in DS pre-dementia.
