Background and Purpose:

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are typical in older adults and have been linked to several poor health outcomes, including cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The presence and severity of WMH have traditionally been attributed to occlusive arteriopathy, but recent evidence also implicates deep medullary venule collagenosis and associated vasogenic edema.

Historically, post-mortem analyses have been the sole way to analyze cerebral veins, but MRI susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) can be now used to examine cortical veins in vivo. The aim of the current study was to determine if there is an association between diameters of the large draining cerebral veins/sinuses and WMH volume.

Materials and Methods:

T2-weighted FLAIR and SWI MRI were obtained in 682 older, nondemented adults (mean age=73.9±5.9, 59.1% women). Total and regional WMH volume was derived. The diameters of five regions of the cerebral venous draining system were measured: internal cerebral veins, basal veins of Rosenthal, superior sagittal sinus, vein of Galen, and straight sinus terminus.

Results:

Increased diameter of the internal cerebral veins was associated with greater total WMH volume (β=0.09, p=0.02), and regionally in the parietal (β=0.10, p=0.006), frontal (β=0.09, p=0.02), and temporal (β=0.09, p=0.02) lobes. Increased diameter of the basal veins of Rosenthal was associated with greater total (β=0.10, p=0.01), frontal (β=0.11, p=0.003), and temporal (β=0.09, p=0.02) WMH volume.

Conclusion:

Our results suggest that caliber of the internal cerebral veins and of the basal veins of Rosenthal relates to regional white matter disease.

Introduction

Chronic ischemia of the brain’s white matter can result in demyelination and axonal loss, manifesting primarily as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), or “leukoaraiosis,” on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.1,2 Increased WMH volume is associated with a number of suboptimal health outcomes, including cognitive decline, elevated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, AD-related genetic profiles, bipolar disorder, and stroke risk.3–8

The importance of vascular dysfunction and AD is increasingly appreciated, but the underlying mechanisms behind this relationship remain unclear.9 Although periventricular venous collagenosis was linked with WMH more than 20 years ago,10 the clinical observations associating vascular disease with WMH typically assume that they are solely arterial in origin. The idea that venous pathology contributes to the radiological manifestation of WMH is now being revisited, and contemporary hypotheses suggest that pathology of the veins and venules may at least partially mediate the association between WMH and AD.11 Periventricular venous collagenosis and large caliber venous stenosis may be one mechanism through which WMH and AD are associated, and venous collagenosis may increase overall resistance in the veins, leading to reduced blood flow to the deep white matter.12 Venous outflow obstruction may also lead to decreased clearance of metabolic byproducts and toxic misfolded proteins as seen in AD, resulting in ischemic stress.12

Cerebral veins have typically been distinguished from the arterial and capillary systems by postmortem analysis with complex immunostaining. Studies of postmortem tissue noted that concentric collagen deposition in the deep medullary venular system (e.g. luminal stenosis or occlusion) correlates with WMH severity.10,13 Historically, the cortical veins have been difficult to distinguish on brain imaging, but MRI susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) can detect cortical veins that are difficult to visualize on T2-weighted or proton density images. With this technique, venous vessels become hypointense due to the magnetic susceptibility difference between oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Even without contrast administration, SWI is particularly sensitive for the visualization of periventricular veins.14 In this study, we used SWI to visualize and measure the diameters of large draining veins in the brain to test the hypothesis that cerebral basal vein dilatation is related to WMH volume.

Methods

Study subjects

The Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) is an ongoing epidemiological study of cognitive aging and dementia in the racially/ethnically diverse community surrounding Columbia University Medical Center in upper Manhattan. It includes randomly sampled adults ≥65 years, as such there are no specific inclusion/exclusion criteria other than age. Over 6,000 participants have been recruited into WHICAP since its inception in 1992. Neuropsychological, medical, neurological, demographic, and psychosocial data are collected on all active participants at approximately 24-month intervals. Neuroimaging was incorporated into WHICAP in two waves, beginning in 2004 and in 2009. For the neuroimaging substudies, participants were enrolled who did not meet diagnostic criteria for dementia at their previous or closest longitudinal visit. In the current study, we analyzed participants with MRI data from the second wave, which included 3 Tesla scans with T1-weighted, T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and SWI sequences. We ascertained vascular risk history based on chart review and participant interview/self-reported history of heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Each vascular risk factor was established by a diagnostic history and/or documentation or report of treatment for the condition, including medication or other medical intervention. These three dichotomous variables were added to create a vascular risk factor summary score that ranged from 0 to 3, as we have done in past studies.15–17. The study was approved by the Columbia University Medical Center ethics committee; all participants gave written informed consent.

Magnetic resonance imaging

MRI scan acquisition was performed using a 3 Tesla Philips Intera scanner. Images included T1-weighted (repetition time [TR] = 6.6 ms, echo time [TE] = 3.0 ms, flip angle = 8 degrees, field-of-view [FOV] = 256 × 256 × 165 mm, slice thickness = 1.0 mm), T2-weighted FLAIR (TR = 8,000 ms, TE = 337 ms, inversion recovery time = 2,400 ms, flip angle = 90 degrees, FOV = 240 × 240 × 180 mm, slice thickness = 2.0 mm), and SWI (TR =16 ms, TE = 22 ms, flip angle =15 degrees, FOV = 512×512× 150 mm, slice thickness = 1.0 mm) sequences.

T1-weighted images were used to estimate total intracranial volume using Freesurfer (v6.0). FLAIR sequencing was used to derive total WMH volume using previously described techniques developed in our laboratory (Figure 1).18,19 In short, FLAIR images were skull stripped and normalized, and a Gaussian curve was fit to map the voxel intensity values. If the voxels were more than 2.1 standard deviations above the mean FLAIR image, they were labeled as WMH. This threshold of 2.1 standard deviations was selected based on greatest sensitivity and specificity of detection across participants, as determined by trained experts. White matter hyperintensity volume in cm3 was calculated as the sum of labeled voxels multiplied by voxel dimensions. All labeled images were visually checked for error and manual corrections were made in the case of false positive errors; the most common false positive errors were small “speckles” of voxels labeled as hyperintense in cortex, likely due to subtle intensity inhomogeneity that is common on T2-weighted images. The brain’s major lobes were derived by applying a standard spatial “lobar” atlas, and regional WMH were defined as the intersection of labeled voxels and each segmented cerebral lobe.

Vein and sinus measurements

3D Slicer 4.8.1 (www.slicer.org) was used to measure the veins and sinuses on SWI (Figure 2).20 In the axial plane, the ruler function was used to measure the diameters of the left and right internal cerebral veins in millimeters. Due to variations in venous morphology and image quality, we visually identified the region of the vein that appeared most continuously linear and measured the diameter of the vein there. In each image, the measurements for the left and right internal cerebral veins were averaged for one value. Also in the axial plane, the base and the anterior-posterior diameter of the superior sagittal sinus were measured immediately above the confluence of sinuses. These measurements were then averaged for one value. We also measured the widths of left and right basal vein of Rosenthal in the axial plane just before they converged with the internal cerebral veins into the vein of Galen. These values were averaged for a singular measurement. In the sagittal plane, the vein of Galen was measured directly inferior to the splenium, where the vein’s width appeared most consistent. Also in the sagittal plane, the straight sinus was measured at its terminus immediately anterior to the confluence of sinuses. Intra-rater reliability of all measurements was confirmed with intraclass correlation coefficients (see following section).

Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics were generated to describe participant demographic data. To test for intra-rater reliability of the vein and sinus measurements, 40 subjects were randomly selected, and their veins and sinuses were re-measured without knowledge of the previous measurement. Of the ten forms of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), a single-rating, absolute-agreement, 2-way random-effects model was chosen based on recently described selection and reporting guidelines.21,22

Linear regression was used to test the primary hypotheses of this study. Each vein/sinus measurement was entered as the independent variable, and total WMH volume was set as the dependent variable. We performed another linear regression with the same variables, adjusting for age at time of scan, estimated intracranial volume, and the aforementioned vascular risk factor score. These linear models were run again separately for each cerebral lobe (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) as dependent variables. After, all regression analyses were repeated separately for all of the measured vein/sinus diameters. Z-scores were also derived for all variables, and these values were used to calculate confidence intervals (Cl) for the standardized beta values.

Results

Sample characteristics

Six hundred eighty-two participants from the WHICAP study had complete SWI, WMH, and demographic data. Participants had a mean age at scan of 73.9 (SD 5.9), and 59.1% were women. There was a fairly even distribution of race/ethnicity among whites, blacks, and Hispanics. The median time interval between the closest clinical follow-up visit and MRI scan was 38 days. Complete demographic data, including vascular disease and primary MRI measurements, are displayed in Table 1.

Intra-rater reliability

All five measurements had ICC values indicating either moderate or good reliability (internal cerebral veins: 0.81 [95% confidence interval 0.67–0.90], basal vein of Rosenthal: 0.73 [0.54–0.85], superior sagittal sinus: 0.68 [0.37–0.84], vein of Galen: 0.76 [0.50–0.88], and straight sinus: 0.76 [0.60–0.87]).22

Relationship between vein/sinus measurements and WMH volumes

In the unadjusted model, increased diameters of the internal cerebral vein, basal vein of Rosenthal, and the superior sagittal sinus were associated with higher total WMH volume (Table 2). Regionally, internal cerebral vein diameter was associated with greater WMH volume across all brain lobes, the basal vein of Rosenthal was associated with greater WMH volume in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, and the superior sagittal sinus was associated with greater WMH volume in the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.

When controlling for age, estimated intracranial volume, and vascular risk factors in the adjusted model, the association between the internal cerebral veins and occipital lobe WMH volume was attenuated, the association between the basal vein of Rosenthal and parietal lobe WMH volume was attenuated, and all associations pertaining to the superior sagittal sinus were attenuated (Table 3). We found that increased diameter of the internal cerebral veins maintained associations with higher total, frontal, temporal, and parietal WMH volume. Increased diameter of the basal vein of Rosenthal maintained associations with higher total, frontal, and temporal WMH volume. The diameters of the vein of Galen and straight sinus terminus were not associated with WMH volume in any of our analyses, either globally or regionally.

Discussion

There is strong evidence that links cerebrovascular disease with WMH. Although current models do not typically implicate veins or venules in the development of WMH, recent data suggest that they may play a role.11 In this cross-sectional study of older adults, we hypothesized that increased venous diameter would be associated with increased WMH volume. We found that increased diameters of the internal cerebral veins and the basal veins of Rosenthal were associated with greater WMH volume (Table 3). The strongest association for the internal cerebral veins was in the parietal lobe, the brain region where past studies have most consistently identified a correlation between WMH and AD.23 The strongest association for the basal veins of Rosenthal was in the frontal lobe.

Our study builds on past studies that identified a relationship between periventricular venous collagenosis and WMH.10,12 In the first description of this phenomenon over 20 years ago, Moody and colleagues studied 22 autopsy brains from older adults and showed that 65% had significant periventricular venous collagenosis of the small deep venules identified by trichrome staining; of these, 77% had severe WMH, as detected on antemortem scans.10 More recently, Keith and colleagues extended these results, primarily implicating the large caliber (&gt;200 μm in diameter) deep penetrating venules in an autopsy sample of 24 dementia patients known to have periventricular white matter disease and 18 controls without dementia. While collagenosis of venules (small and medium caliber deep medullary venules) and myelin pallor (a marker of demyelination) also correlated with WMH volume, in a multivariate analysis, stenosis of the large diameter venules best predicted WMH volumes.12 The same lab group also previously corroborated these results in vivo, using novel imaging techniques to visualize intraparenchymal venules or perivascular spaces, similarly describing an association between enlargement of these vessels and WMH volume.24

Yan and colleagues used SWI MRI to quantify venulopathy of the deep medullary veins based on voxel intensity projection images.25 They found a relationship between WMH volume and large caliber deep medullary vein visibility, which may be a manifestation of venous collagenosis.25 In a follow-up study, this same group created a visual grading score of deep medullary veins, based on the venous continuity and homogeneity, and found that scores were higher in subjects with higher WMH volume.26

Our study is the first to find an association between WMH and larger cerebral veins, namely the internal cerebral veins and the basal veins of Rosenthal. In the brain, the veins are valveless and the draining system begins in the postcapillary venule and drains into venules, collecting veins, major parenchymal veins, the extraparenchymal veins, and finally the major dural sinuses. In particular, the periventricular veins drain into both the deep medullary veins as well as the internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal. Moody and colleagues hypothesized that periventricular venous collagenosis increases venous pressure, thus shunting blood away from these larger veins.10 Understanding the pathophysiology underlying the association between venous diameter and increased WMH, a traditional marker of small artery disease, may help us broaden the vascular contributions to AD and related dementias. We must interpret this association cautiously, as we do not have histologic data to provide evidence as to what may be contributing to this increased diameter.

It is likely that venous collagenosis in aging is driven by chronic ischemia in the periventricular white matter from chronic occlusive arteriopathies, resulting from vascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, but also possibly amyloid angiopathy, arteriolar tortuosity related to age, and other arterial pathologies.27,28 Arterial occlusive diseases exacerbate the gradient of diminishing cerebral blood flow toward the periventricular white matter, and this is especially evident in the watershed zones at the frontal and posterior horns of the ventricles.29 This chronic ischemia leads to venous collagenosis, which makes the deep medullary venules leaky and less able to absorb fluid. Collagenosis also increases venous resistance, which can further impair perfusion and interstitial flow and also may impede perivascular clearance of toxic proteins such as amyloid.12 The resulting venous hypertension could also increase pressure in the adjacent internal cerebral veins and basal veins, enlarging their diameter, thus causing them to become dilated in some individuals. This effect may be dampened in the vein of Galen, as it is quite larger and drains venous blood from a number of other regions including the basal ganglia, thalamus and occipital regions. The straight sinus and superior sagittal sinus are lined by dura and would therefore not be expected to change in size with increased venous pressure.

Typically, cerebral venous dilatory anomalies are described as developmental in nature, usually resulting in severe complications that present neonatally or in early childhood. To our knowledge, the only descriptions of enlarged internal cerebral veins or basal veins of Rosenthal in the older population have been in cases of cerebral venous thrombosis, a clinically symptomatic condition that often presents with headache, stroke symptoms, and seizures.32–34 Some type of pathology downstream of the veins, such as increased resistance, stenosis, or vessel tortuosity, could result in reflux and subsequent dilation, similar to what is seen in varicose veins. Vein of Galen malformations and aneurysmal dilations, for example, both congenital anomalies, result in dilation of the internal cerebral veins and basal veins of Rosenthal due to reflux.35

Another possibility is that a larger vein diameter may result from dilated perivascular space around it. Enlarged perivascular space has been described as a feature of cerebral small vessel disease, with specific association with lacunar ischemic stroke and WMH.36 Likewise, a strong association has been observed between the severity of dilation of perivascular spaces and severity of AD, and this relationship correlates to beta-amyloid load in the cortex.37 Interestingly, venous collagenosis in the deep white matter has been observed in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL),28 a syndrome that also exhibits dilated perivascular spaces.38 Furthermore, perivascular spaces are thought to be involved in the clearing of interstitial solutes such as beta-amyloid via the glymphatic system.39 Thus, if venous dilatation were a surrogate marker of dilated perivascular spaces, the associations that we found would have biological plausibility as suggested by current literature. We are currently developing techniques for perivascular space quantification, which we hope to use in future studies.

Overall, this study provides evidence of the relationship between WMH and both the internal cerebral veins and the basal veins of Rosenthal. It is unclear whether this association is merely correlative, or if there is a causative nature between these pathologies. The issue of multiple comparisons is a potential limitation to the study, but most of the observed effects were similar in magnitude and predicted direction; therefore we do not believe that they were merely a result of a type I error. Susceptibility weighted imaging MRI is a non-invasive modality that allows for vein visualization in vivo. The “blooming effect” is a phenomenon known to occur in SWI scans, in which certain hypointense signals become amplified. Although blooming may have played a role in the absolute values that we were able to measure, as all SWI scans were acquired under identical, controlled parameters, any blooming impact should be consistent across all subjects.

There are many avenues that can expand on this research in the future. As mentioned above, our lab is in the process of developing methods for perivascular space quantification, which could be used to determine if these spaces relate to cerebral venous diameter. Longitudinal comparative analyses and/or comparisons across age groups could provide evidence of a temporal relationship. We could also examine specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD to see if there is an association between vein/sinus diameter and CSF amyloid and tau. Our cohort consists of randomly recruited individuals without dementia diagnoses; an analysis of subjects with MCI and AD could provide a more nuanced understanding of this relationship. Other techniques such as angiography could depict what is happening internally within the vasculature to help delineate the pathology, although costs and physical risks could provide significant limitations. With the aging population, the clinical implications are clear: understanding the etiology of this relationship might lead to therapeutic and preventative techniques to combat vascular disease and its downstream effects.
