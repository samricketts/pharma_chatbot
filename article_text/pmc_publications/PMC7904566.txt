Objective:

We sought to evaluate early clinical differences between cerebral arteriolosclerosis (pARTE), Alzheimer’s disease (pAD), and AD with arteriolosclerosis (ADARTE).

Methods:

Using National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) neuropathology diagnoses, we defined pARTE (n=21), pAD (n=203), and ADARTE (n=158) groups. We compared demographics, medical history, psychometrics, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele variants across neuropathology groups. Retrospective time points were first evaluation with Global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 and 1.0, via the CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument, corresponding to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia, respectively.

Results:

In MCI, clinical differences were minimal but pARTE subjects were older, had later onset cognitive decline, and progressed less severely than pAD. In mild dementia, pAD subjects were younger and had earlier onset of decline. Neuropsychiatric (depression) and psychometric (Logical Memory Delayed Recall, Trails B) differences also emerged between the groups. In MCI, APOE4 associated with worse Logical Memory Delayed Recall in pAD and ADARTE. In mild dementia, APOE4 associated with better animal fluency in pAD, but with better Trails A performance and more neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPIQ) in ADARTE.

Conclusions:

Differences between pARTE, pAD, and ADARTE emerge at mild dementia rather than MCI. APOE4 has varied cognitive and psychiatric impact dependent on neuropathology group and stage.

Introduction:

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease are common causes of age-related cognitive decline. Cerebral small vessel disease refers to subcortical infarcts or white matter changes, not large cortical infarcts. They often coexist but can be difficult to distinguish and their exact clinical interactions are unclear, especially at earlier stages1. Clinically differentiating AD and cerebrovascular related cognitive decline can help guide therapeutics and prognosis, as mortality, comorbidities, progression, and cognitive phenotype may differ2, 3. AD typically features prominent episodic memory loss while cerebral small vessel disease may produce a dysexecutive pattern with less severe memory loss4. Both pathologies may have variable courses and severity, highlighting the challenge in clinical diagnosis.

Prior studies have used community longitudinal cohorts of autopsy-confirmed cases with non-uniform results at more advanced, dementia stages2–6. Further, less is known about earlier stages such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), when strategies targeting certain pathologies may prevent or slow cognitive decline. Therefore, we sought to evaluate differences in clinical profiles at MCI and mild dementia stages between those with arteriolosclerosis alone (pARTE), AD alone (pAD), and AD with arteriolosclerosis (ADARTE) using retrospective clinical data on autopsy-confirmed cases from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database, a multicenter and nationwide collection of longitudinal clinical information on cognitive decline. To better distinguish pathologies, we wished to isolate clinical characteristics specific to cerebral small vessel disease and Alzheimer’s disease, therefore examined only “pure” pathology states. Additionally, as AD and cerebrovascular disease share apolipoprotein E allele (APOE) 4 as a risk factor, which has less understood impact in cerebrovascular disease7, we also evaluated the phenotypic effects of APOE4 within each neuropathology group.

Methods:

Over 30 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADC) throughout the United States of America enroll subjects and collects data for NACC. Since 2005, a Uniform Data Set (UDS) has been used to collect standardized and longitudinal clinical information on a wide range of patients from cognitively normal to demented. Trained clinicians and clinic personnel collect UDS data from the participant and co-participant, usually a close friend or family member. Diagnoses are made by a team consensus or single physician8. The neuropathology data set is a subsample of UDS participants who died and underwent autopsy with standardized data collection9. We acquired NACC data for UDS visits conducted between September 2005 and April 2019, which comprised of about 40,032 participants and 5,637 subjects in the neuropathology subset.

We collected retrospective clinical data on autopsy-confirmed cases from the NACC database (n=5,637) to define neuropathology groups of pure arteriolosclerosis (pARTE), pure AD (pAD), and AD with arteriolosclerosis (ADARTE) who also had apolipoprotein E allele genotyping. Subjects included had moderate to severe arteriolosclerosis and/or National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) ABC score for AD of 2–3, without other major neuropathology including stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases. Neuropathologic assessments in the NACC database are made by minimum sampling of brain regions with hematoxylin and eosin stains10. Arteriolosclerosis is defined as concentric hyaline thickening of the media of arterioles with possible intimal fibrosis. Global arteriolosclerosis severity is judged qualitatively on a scale of none, mild, moderate, or severe. AD pathology is further assessed with immunohistochemistry (preferred), Thioflavin S, or sensitive silver histochemical stains to derive an ABC score by ranking Aβ plaque score, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage, and CERAD neuritic plaque score. ABC scores range from 0–3, with scores 2 and 3 as intermediate and high AD pathology considered as sufficient explanation for dementia.

We then identified the first UDS evaluation with Global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 and 1.0, corresponding to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia stages respectively, using the CDR® Dementia Staging Instrument. The CDR score assesses the functional and cognitive status of a participant with any degree of clinical cognitive impairment, not limited to Alzheimer’s disease, through domains or ‘boxes’ of memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care11. Subjects could be included in both CDR 0.5 and 1.0 stages. Ultimately, 382 unique participants were included (6.8% of all available autopsy confirmed cases). To assess our sample composition, we compared demographics and comorbidities against all excluded subjects. Included subjects were enrolled from 26 ADCs.

At CDR 0.5 and 1.0, we compared demographics, vascular risk factors, CDR progression, and available cognitive testing and neuropsychiatric symptoms across neuropathology groups and subgroups of APOE4. We also compared total number of vascular risk factors, represented as “vascular risk factor composite”, which is a summation ranging from 0 to 4 based on number of comorbidities from hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or any smoking history. Subjects were dichotomized as either APOE4 carrier or non-carrier. We determined CDR progression from all available CDR scores from initial to final evaluation of each subject. We used CDR Sum of Boxes to determine the highest Sum of Boxes score at any visit (highest sum), greatest absolute difference between highest and lowest CDR Sum of Box scores (greatest change), change of CDR Sum of Boxes from initial to final evaluation (first to last visit change), and the change per year (“first to last visit change” divided by years followed). Of all included subjects, we also evaluated clinical characteristics at CDR 0, corresponding with no functional impairment.

All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). For categorical variables, we used Pearson Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. We applied post-hoc pairwise categorical comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. For continuous variables, we assessed distribution normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Neuropsychiatric battery tests were non-normally distributed. We used one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test or Kruskal-Wallis H test with post-hoc Dunn’s test with Bonferroni adjustment to compare neuropathology groups and independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare APOE subgroups. Neuropsychiatric tests in neuropathology groups and APOE4 subgroups were then analyzed using multinomial logistic regression and binomial logistic regression respectively to adjust for confounders through 3 models: (1) unadjusted, (2) adjusted for age, sex, education, and (3) additionally adjusted for vascular risk factor composite sum (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or smoking history), depression, and selectively APOE carrier status in neuropathology models or ABC score/arteriolosclerosis severity in APOE models. The values p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results:

From the 5,637 available autopsy-confirmed cases in the NACC database, we identified neuropathology groups of pARTE (n=21), pAD (n=203), and ADARTE (n=158) who had apolipoprotein E allele genotyping and a first UDS evaluation with CDR 0.5 or 1.0. There were 156 participants in both CDR 0.5 (62%) and 1.0 (54%) stages (21 pARTE, 81 pAD, and 69 ADARTE subjects). Compared to all excluded participants (not shown), our sample of 382 subjects had similar age, sex, race, education, and vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking history), but were followed for longer within NACC (5.3 vs 2.9 years, p&lt;0.001) and had less depression (29% vs 38%, p=0.001) (not shown). In CDR 0.5, there were 17 pARTE, 128 pAD, 107 ADARTE subjects. There were 29.4%, 52.3%, and 51.4% APOE4 allele positive subjects in pARTE, pAD, ADARTE, respectively (p=0.199). In CDR 1.0, there were 10 pARTE, 156 pAD, 120 ADARTE subjects, which had 40.0%, 53.2%, and 60.0% APOE4 allele carriers respectively (p=0.318) (See Table 1). Of all 382 included subjects, there were 11 pARTE, 39 pAD, and 32 ADARTE subjects who also had an evaluation with CDR 0 stage. At CDR 0, there were no differences in demographics, comorbidities, or neuropsychiatric metrics (not shown).

In CDR 0.5, or MCI, pARTE subjects were older (mean age pARTE/pAD/ADARTE, 84.6/75.8/78.4, p=0.001) and were older at initial noted cognitive decline (mean age pARTE/pAD/ADARTE, 81.9/72.4/74.7, p=0.011). There were no other differences in demographics including vascular risk factors. At CDR 1.0, or mild dementia, pAD subjects were younger (74.1 vs 85.0 and 78.6 for pARTE and ADARTE, p&lt;0.001) and also younger at first noted cognitive decline (68.9 vs 79.3 and 73.0 for pARTE and ADARTE, p&lt;0.001). At this mild dementia stage, there was a difference in proportion of diabetes between the three groups (p=0.036), with a trend towards more diabetes in the ADARTE group than pAD subjects (Bonferoni correction p&gt;0.05). At CDR 1.0, the pAD group had more depression (p=0.032, Bonferoni correction p&lt;0.05) (Table 1).

For functional and neuropsychiatric measures, neuropathology groups at CDR 0.5 did not show many significant differences (Tables 2, 3). pAD subjects seemed to have worse functional status and decline than pARTE subjects as measured by CDR Sum of Boxes (Table 2). This was dependent on demographic and medical factors, as it was attenuated after adjustment for such confounders (Supplemental Table 1). We found no differences in the time from CDR 0.5 to &gt;0.5 between neuropathology groups (median days [IQR]: pARTE: 778 [546–1042], pAD: 778 [546–1042], ADARTE: 896 [425–1312], p=0.713) (not shown). At CDR 1.0, more clinical differences emerged. The pARTE subjects showed more depressive symptoms on the Geriatric Depression Scale scores than pAD subjects (4.7 vs 2.2, p=0.044), and performed better on Logical Memory Delayed Recall than pAD and ADARTE subjects (5.5 vs 1.7 and 2.0 for pAD and ADARTE, p=0.024). In addition, pAD subjects were slower on Trail-Making Test - Part B than ADARTE (246 vs 197, p&lt;0.001) (Table 3). When adjusting for confounders, these statistical differences remained (Supplemental Table 1).

When evaluating for genotypic effects of APOE4 status, there were varied associations between cognitive stages. In pAD and ADARTE groups, there were no differences in functional status or progression of functional decline at both CDR 0.5 or 1.0 (Supplemental Table 2a, 2b). In MCI, APOE4 related to demographics only in the ADARTE group: those with APOE4 were younger (77 vs 80 years), were more likely to be male (53.8% vs 34.5%), and were younger at first cognitive decline (73 vs 76 years) (Table 4). Psychometric performance was impacted in both pAD and ADARTE groups, with worse Logical Memory Delayed Recall performance in those with APOE4 allele, after adjustment for confounders (Supplemental Table 3). In mild dementia, APOE4 positive subjects had younger age of first cognitive decline (71 vs 76 years) again only in the ADARTE group. Psychometric impact was different, with APOE4 associating with better Trail-Making Test Part A performance (not significant in regression models) and higher neuropsychiatric inventory totals in the ADARTE group, and better performance in animal fluency in the pAD group (10.6 vs 8.6) (Table 5).

Discussion:

Our results from this retrospective analysis of autopsy-confirmed cases in the NACC database suggest that more clinical differences in age-related cognitive decline between AD and cerebral small vessel disease emerge at mild dementia rather than MCI. At CDR 0.5 or MCI, we find those with pure arteriolosclerosis neuropathology were older and had later reported first cognitive decline in life than the AD pathology groups, but no differences in any neuropsychiatric profiles. At CDR 1.0 or mild dementia, the pure AD pathology group were younger and had earlier reported first cognitive decline in life than other pathology groups. We identified various differences in neuropsychiatric testing at this stage including higher GDS and better Logical Memory Delayed Recall performance in pARTE subjects, and worse verbal fluency and trail-making performance in pAD group compared to pARTE group.

MCI, or the intermediate but not necessarily transitional, cognitive state between normal cognition and dementia, is heterogenous in the community and has been the focus for identifying early and modifiable risk factors of further cognitive decline. In a large community-based population cohort, those more likely to progress from MCI to dementia had characteristics matching a typical prodromal AD profile of memory impairment and APOE4 genotype. Those that did not progress or reverted to normal cognition were more likely to take prescription medications and had more vascular risk factors, suggesting these groups represent potentially reversible MCI12. Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lower signature AD region volumes (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and surrounding structures), brain microhemorrhages, and higher white matter hyperintensity volumes were associated with dementia, but vascular changes were more important in the development of MCI than its progression to dementia13.

Several prior studies have sought to clinically differentiate cognitive decline between AD and cerebrovascular disease using neuropsychological profiles in pathologically defined groups. Specifically, AD pathology had prominent amnestic memory impairment while cerebral small vessel disease showed tendency towards worse performance in phonemic fluency and executive function but better in recognition memory3, 4. Pure AD and mixed pathology subjects in our study had worse memory performance in the Logical Memory Delayed Recall testing than pure arteriolosclerosis. Neuroanatomically, this may be explained by the predominant failure of the limbic diencephalic memory system in AD and dysfunction of the frontal-subcortical loops between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in cerebral small vessel disease, though overlaps may exist14.

AD and vascular pathologies frequently co-exist throughout clinical course, especially in later age, and across all Braak stages, with vascular pathology generally thought to provide an additive deleterious effect15. This exact effect, however, has been controversial as the cognitive effects of cerebral small vessel disease may be variable and indistinct4. Mixed pathology cases with more advanced Braak stages were found to have similar neuropsychiatric testing as pure AD subjects suggesting effects of AD overwhelm cerebral small vessel disease2. Therefore, cerebral small vessel disease may have more modest impacts on cognition3, 4. We similarly find mixed ADARTE subjects did not clearly have earlier cognitive decline or worse neuropsychiatric performances than AD subjects without significant cerebrovascular disease burden. We also did not find a difference in time between first visit with MCI (CDR 0.5) and CDR&gt;0.5 or difference in change in CDR per years followed between neuropathology groups. Some studies suggest vascular pathology may increase odds or lower threshold for dementia in AD pathology15, 16, while others have not17. Other studies have shown varied relationships between cerebrovascular disease and AD, suggesting either additive or synergistic effects18–20. The Einstein Aging Study showed that macrovascular brain pathology had an effect on cognitive decline even after adjustment for AD pathology, highlighting the need to treat modifiable vascular risk factors regardless of exact interaction between AD and cerebrovascular disease5.

In our study, pure arteriolosclerosis subjects had non-statistically significant higher prevalence of diabetes at the mild dementia stage than other neuropathology groups. When evaluating cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, any smoking history) combined, there were no differences between neuropathology groups at any cognitive stage. However, at both MCI and mild dementia, a majority of subjects in all neuropathology groups had either hypertension or hyperlipidemia, representing potentially early modifiable risk factors. A Swedish retrospective autopsy-confirmed study could not identify any association between vascular risk factors and AD, cerebrovascular dementia, or mixed dementia suggesting pathologically dissimilar groups with complex risk factor associations6. Interestingly, this study and others also find lower prevalence of diabetes in AD groups21, 22. Some studies have suggested metabolic syndrome, or grouping of cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, was associated with an increased incidence of MCI and progression to dementia23, 24.

Late life depression is linked with increased risk in all-cause dementia, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease25. There may be a bi-directional relationship between depression and cerebrovascular disease with depression as a modifiable independent risk factor specifically for subcortical cerebrovascular disease and vascular dementia26, 27. Further, different dementias may have different progression of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Clinically followed dementia cohorts revealed depression may occur more frequently in vascular dementia than Alzheimer’s dementia at the same cognitive level28, 29 and depression became more severe with progressive cognitive decline in vascular dementia than other dementias30. Interestingly in our pathologically confirmed cohort, we find the pAD group had significantly higher depression starting at CDR 1.0 than the ADARTE group. This may reflect varied relationships with depression at earlier rather than later cognitive stages.

When evaluating for effects of APOE4 genotype, we find varied associations in clinical profiles and neuropsychologic performance between neuropathology groups at different cognitive stages. We find at both CDR 0.5 and 1.0, APOE4 carriers in ADARTE group were younger and had earlier first reported cognitive decline. We found that APOE4 carriers had lower prevalence of hypertension than non-carriers in some neuropathologic and CDR sub-groups. APOE4 carrier subjects were often younger and possibly received medical care for longer, which could reflect enrollment bias and affect comorbidities. In MCI, subjects with APOE4 genotype in both pAD and ADARTE groups had worse memory performance testing. We did not find APOE genotype had an effect in those with arteriolosclerosis alone, but this analysis may be limited due to smaller sample size. Though well established in AD31, the influence of APOE4 genotype on vascular or mixed pathology is less clear but may play an important role in development of vascular related dementia32, 33. Vascular risk factors, history of stroke, and APOE4 genotype may all contribute independently to cognitive decline as early as fifth decade of life34. In some studies, APOE4 allele has been linked to white matter lesions on MRI but not others7, 35. Of the few pathological studies specifically examining APOE4 and vascular dementia, APOE4 genotype and arteriolosclerosis or cerebral white matter damage show varied associations7, 36. In both AD and vascular dementia patients, APOE4 genotype has been linked with poorer cognitive functioning, specifically impairment in information processing speed and attention37.

Further, APOE4 may have varied anatomic effects, which may be why we saw better performance in certain domains at the dementia stage (executive, semantic) but worse in the MCI stage (recall). In a study comparing autopsy confirmed amnestic AD, primary progressive aphasia AD, and normal controls, the proportion of APOE4 carriers was elevated in amnestic AD but not aphasic manifestations of APOE4, suggesting anatomic factors conferring vulnerability to AD pathology in memory-related medial temporal areas rather than language-related neocortices38. After the first year of stroke, APOE4 carriers had delayed recovery of verbal memory function and reduced entorhinal cortex volumes than compared to non-carriers, also suggesting a role for anatomic factors in vascular pathology39.

Strengths of this study include an autopsy-confirmed cohort from a nationwide multicenter database and analysis at MCI where potentially modifiable risk factors may be recognized and treated earlier. Clinical criteria for vascular dementia have low diagnostic sensitivity40, made especially difficult with co-existing pathologies, therefore utilizing an autopsy confirmed sample adds diagnostic certainty. Weaknesses include the cross-sectional study design and limitations in generalizability to the community, which include our selection of pure pathology states and possible enrollment bias. While our study sample had similar demographics and vascular risk factors from the NACC neuropathology subset, the selected pure pathology states may not likely reflect true community pathology, which is probably more heterogenous. Certain populations may be more likely to enroll from tertiary care centers, participate in a research study, and consent for autopsy, which is likely reflected in the predominantly white and higher educated composition of our study sample. Enrollment bias may also apply to APOE4 carriers, who may be more medicalized and introduced to NACC earlier in life through early genetic testing due to known family carriers. Together, these factors may have impacted neuropsychiatric testing comparisons. Additionally, there is the possibility of variable data collection between NACC sites, which we were unable to statistically account for in our analysis. Most vascular risk factors were only available as categories that can reflect clinician diagnosis, but the diagnostic criteria may not be exact. Also, several subjects did not have complete neuropsychiatric testing or variable tests used partly due to implementation of new neuropsychiatric batteries in updated versions of UDS. Lastly, we had relatively smaller sample sizes after subject selection, particularly in pure arteriolosclerosis.

In conclusion, we find in neuropathology defined groups from the NACC database that clinical differences between pARTE, pAD, and ADARTE emerge at mild dementia rather than MCI. This may have implications in early targeted treatment, trial recruitment, and patient guidance on MCI when these pathologies cannot be easily distinguished. Further, it may underscore a need for adjunctive diagnostics such as MRI, positron emission tomography, or cerebrospinal fluid analysis in MCI to distinguish pathologies. APOE4 allele has varied associations within neuropathology groups at different stages but notably worsened memory performance in pAD and ADARTE groups at MCI, better animal fluency in pAD at mild dementia, worse neuropsychiatric symptoms and trail-making performance in ADARTE subjects at mild dementia. Taken together in context of prior studies, our findings underscore complex clinical interactions between AD and subcortical cerebrovascular disease pathologies and in APOE4 genotypes.
