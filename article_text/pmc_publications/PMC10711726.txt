Introduction:

Biomarker testing for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) brings new opportunities for nurses to foster shared decision-making by leading pre-test counseling (PTC) for patients and families.

Methods:

Audio-recordings of 18 nurse-led PTC sessions were analyzed to characterize questions posed by patient and family members dyads considering whether to pursue amyloid positron emission tomography.

Results:

Sessions lasted 20 to 75 minutes and generated rich discussion of the purpose and potential implications of amyloid imaging. Dyads posed questions regarding: basic neuroanatomy; the spectrum of normal cognitive aging to dementia; clinical phenotypes and pathological hallmarks of ADRD; secondary prevention of ADRD; and advance planning. In response, PTC facilitators provided disease-specific education, clarification of overt misconceptions, caregiver support, and emotion de-escalation.

Conclusion:

Nurses conducting PTC for AD biomarker testing should be equipped to answer questions about topics both directly and indirectly related to testing, and also provide emotional support.

pmcIntroduction

Advances in research on biomarker testing for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have led to a new era where pathological changes associated with AD can be identified in living individuals, including those who may have no, or minimal, symptoms of cognitive decline.1,2 Nurses practicing in geriatric and other dementia specialty care settings may play a critical role in educating and supporting patients and families who are considering such testing. To inform best practices in this emerging role, we present findings from a qualitative analysis of nurse-led, pre-test counseling sessions conducted in a randomized controlled trial of reactions to AD biomarker testing.

Background

A biomarker, or biological marker, is a substance or process within the human body that can detect or predict a disease process or an outcome using blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or a brain image.3 Similar to genetic testing,4 biomarker testing for AD can evoke a range of psychological and emotional responses in both patients and care partners of those undergoing testing.5,6 The ratio of benefits (e.g., knowledge) to risks (e.g., emotional upset) must be carefully weighed by those considering predictive or diagnostic testing for AD, especially in light of the devastating implications of, and limited treatments for, AD and related disorders. One way of ensuring that individuals carefully weigh the pros and cons of testing is through a process called pre-test counseling.7

Modeled after practice guidelines in the field of genetic counseling, pre-test counseling for AD biomarker testing can be performed by nurses to provide patients and their family members with the information and support needed to make an informed decision about AD biomarker testing.7 One key difference from the setting of genetic testing for AD is that fluid and imaging-based biomarkers for AD can function serve both predictive and diagnostic purposes, with imaging-based markers like amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scans allowing for the visualization of AD pathology in patients’ brains revealing the potential etiology of cognitive changes and informing real-time treatment decisions. Unlike genetic testing which is more commonly performed to determine the AD risk status of a cognitively healthy person,8 some candidates for AD biomarker testing may already be experiencing symptoms of cognitive impairment. Conducting pre-test counseling with cognitively impaired persons requires a high level of communicative skillfulness to ensure adequate comprehension of the information presented, including ample opportunities to pose questions and seek clarification. Newly published appropriate use practice guidelines suggest that candidates for recently approved anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody therapies for AD will include amyloid positive persons with early stage dementia or those meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI),9,10 a syndrome widely regarding as an intermediate clinical state between normal cognitive aging and dementia.11 AD biomarker testing will play a critical role as the field enters this new era of disease modifying treatment, making it imperative to develop best practices for pre-test counseling.

The objective of this paper is to describe the nature and frequency of questions raised by cognitively symptomatic patients and their family care partners during pre-test counseling sessions that were conducted, primarily by nurses, as part of a randomized clinical trial on reactions to AD biomarker disclosure. Our goal is to identify unmet information needs and opportunities to improve the process of nurse-led pre-testing counseling for AD biomarker testing.

Methods and materials

Design

We conducted a qualitative descriptive analysis12 of audio-recorded pre-test counseling sessions from the [blinded for peer review] trial. This method allowed us to code and analyze the real-time interactions of patients and family members with pre-test counselors to characterize the questions and concerns arising during these sessions and, in turn, the knowledge and skills required to meet the information and support needs of patient and family members.

Sample and setting

All participants were recruited for the parent study through the University of [blinded] Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) using criterion sampling. The Return of Amyloid Imaging Results (RAISR; NIH AG046906) study enrollment criteria, consent procedures, and study design have been previously described. Briefly, eligible patient participants had to have a consensus-based diagnosis of MCI and be free of active, untreated mood disorders. A willing adult study partner, typically a family member, was also required. In the parent study, 37 patients of the 119 screened were excluded; 8 were ineligible, 18 declined to participate, and 11 were lost to contact.13,14 The first eighteen dyads (patient + care partner) to undergo pre-test counseling in the parent study were included in this secondary analysis, with data saturation achieved.14

Procedures

Pre-test counseling sessions were conducted by a master’s-prepared registered nurse or counselor to educate dyads about amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and explore their thoughts and concerns about the opportunity to pursue this form of AD biomarker testing. Amyloid PET scans use radioligands to detect the presence of neuritic plaques, a neuropathological hallmark of AD.15 As previously described, the counseling sessions included information regarding MCI, AD, and amyloid imaging, along with an opportunity for questions, reflection, and support for the dyad undergoing testing.13

Data and analysis

Data consisted of audio recordings of face-to-face pre-test counseling (PTC) sessions, which included opportunities for dyads to pose questions to the pre-test counselor. Recordings were transcribed verbatim. Length of the visits varied depending on participants’ concerns and comments, with the shortest counseling session lasting 20 minutes and the longest being just under 75 minutes. Tran-scripts were coded line by line, with a focus on questions posed by both participants and their care partners. Using the principles of qualitative description,12 codes were grouped into categories and labeled using terms that reflected shared discussion features emerging within different portions of the counseling sessions. Discussions of motivations for pursuing amyloid PET are excluded from this report as they were the focus of an earlier analysis of data from an overlapping sample.7 Questions concerning the logistics of the study (e.g., “when is our next appointment”) were also excluded from this analysis.

Results

Table 1 provides an overview of participants and their care partners. The following paragraphs describe questions and concerns arising during each portion of PTC, and Table 2 shows the role of the nurse during PTC.

Establishing context: personal definition of MCI

All sessions began with an invitation for dyads to share what MCI meant to them personally. Subjective definitions of MCI were given by both participants and study partners. Most dyad members defined MCI by its symptoms and described difficulty remembering faces, names, or directions, as well as difficulty concentrating, for example, at work. Others defined MCI in what has previously been described as a prognosis-focused way,16 drawing comparisons to an AD diagnosis or describing it as a first step to inevitably developing AD. One participant required clarification of an overt misunderstanding MCI after describing MCI to mean, “.. .a person has some sort of dementia.” Conversations of this nature evoked strong emotion from some participants. Several participants described MCI as being stressful and frustrating. One participant with MCI expressed his frustration with the diagnostic label itself, stating, “.. .to me the word ‘mild’ is ridiculous because nothing about cognitive impairment.. .is mild.. .it affects your life every single day.” One participant described feeling, “useless,” and another described an “inability to keep control.” There were also instances of participants expressing fear. Some care partners also expressed emotional concern, stating that this diagnosis is stressful and that being a care partner can be time consuming.

MCI as distinct from AD and normal aging

During this portion of PTC, dyads often raised questions about AD. Topics included defining AD, how it relates to dementia, and risk factors for AD. Four dyads expressed confusion regarding the relationship between intelligence and AD. One participant stated, “People that are smart.. .I’ve known a few of them, that once they get that certain age.. .they’re into Alzheimer’s. How does that have—does that have anything to do with it.. .?”

Dyads also inquired about the relationship between MCI and AD, discussing the progression and shared risk factors between MCI and AD. Many participants expressed difficulty discerning whether their symptoms signal MCI or normal aging. Regarding decline in depth perception, one participant stated, “I don’t know if I grab a cup or something and I miss the distance of it.. .I don’t know if that’s—part of this MCI or is it just—maybe I need new glasses I don’t know.” Several dyads also asked if MCI is the first manifestation of AD and whether progression is inevitable. Two participants assumed that MCI is a normal part of aging.

AD prevention

Eleven out of eighteen counseling sessions led to conversations regarding the prevention of dementia. Discussions of this nature encompassed lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions undertaken in hopes of slowing the progression of their decline. This type of dialogue was most often initiated during the risk factor and the pathology portions of counseling sessions and was often initiated by participants rather than their study partners. Participants often began this discussion by describing their personal strategies for prevention of AD or dementia. One dyad asked how exercise improves brain health, while others expressed a basic understanding of lifestyle interventions for improving cognitive function. However, dyads also expressed frustration concerning the difficulty of getting daily physical exercise. Of note, discussions of pharmacologic interventions were initiated by only three dyads.

Mechanism of disease/general brain anatomy

Counseling sessions included information concerning the pathophysiology of AD and the manifestations of dementia. This teaching led to further discussion from twelve dyads regarding either the mechanism of AD or general brain anatomy and physiology questions. Questions of this nature touched upon the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, the changing of neurons in the brain related to AD, the location and concentration of plaque buildup, the role of genetics, and the physical manifestations that accompany this diagnosis. Questions were typically direct in nature and more often initiated by the participant with MCI.

Several dyads had brain anatomy questions extending beyond Alzheimer’s pathology. These general brain anatomy and physiology concerns were related to the functions and processes of the brain as a whole or a specific region, as well as the composition of neurons and how they relate to cognitive operations. Dyads asked questions such as where memory was controlled and how many neurons are in the brain.

Scan-related

Pre-test counseling sessions included education for dyads regarding amyloid imaging and the function of the PET scan. This education led to discussion points surrounding the imaging agent, risk, what it indicates, and purpose of the scan for the study. Though it was stated in counseling that scanning involves minimal radiation, some dyads were concerned with the effect of radiation exposure on their health. Clarification was also sought concerning the need and timing of a future amyloid PET scan, for follow-up purposes.

Drawing on previous experience with AD

Twelve dyads referred to previous experiences with AD during counseling. This includes comments made by the participant or the study partner concerning personal encounters with AD, including family history and its impact on decisions and opinions related to the participant’s MCI. Experiences varied among dyads, as one participant stated her physician suggested research participation and another participant expressed frustration with having to find the study herself. Some dyads also discussed experiences, generally positive, of family members who participated in brain health studies.

Discussion of results with others

The PTC session explored who the participant will decide to share the results with, and if these results would be shared with the participant’s physician. This section encompassed comments made by either the participant or the care partner regarding whether to share scan results with others or not and rationale for this decision, as well as with whom the results will be shared if the decision to share the scan results has been made along with reasoning for this decision. Analysis of this section found that sixteen participants stated they would want to tell others the scan results, but preferences regarding who to tell, and why, varied.

Stigma was frequently discussed. Stigma-related comments were made by both participants and care partners and focused on the fear of being viewed negatively or differently by the sharing of the diagnosis of MCI and/or the amyloid PET results with others. Some participants spoke from experience, stating once they discussed their diagnosis of MCI with others, they were treated differently. One participant said, “.. .As soon as I tell people that I’m in this research to begin with, they treat me WAY different.” Other participants were hesitant to tell people because they didn’t want pity as demonstrated by statements such as, “I don’t think it’s their business and I don’t want people feeling sorry for me or, you know, treating me differently than—because I think they would.” One participant was afraid to share the results for fear that because she was older, she would be viewed as a “hysterical woman,” illustrating her fears of sexism and ageism.

Planning ahead

PTC sessions included advising dyads regarding advance planning for health care (including long-term care insurance) and financial decision-making. This led to active discussions between dyad members regarding what advance planning is already in place and in some cases, extended to discussions regarding preferences for future health care.

The final part of the session covered more general plans for action upon receiving scan results. This content did not generate many questions, but rather stimulated discussions within 8 dyads about either immediate or long-term decision-making, time management, and resource allocation after the PET scan results are disclosed. Several dyads explained that their planning will be based upon the type of result received and some dyads stated it is difficult to anticipate how they will plan until they have the results. Many dyads discussed immediate planning activities upon receiving scan results. Immediate planning most often encompassed allocation of time and resources. Some dyads reported they would take a trip or pursue bucket list activities to maximize their high quality time. One participant exemplified stating, “If I want a fancier car, I would get a fancier car! That kind of thing. There’s things I want to do while I have the [faculties] to appreciate it.” Others were more pragmatic. For example, another participant stated if the scan result showed that she had a significant buildup of amyloid, she would consider lessening her responsibilities at work.

Discussion

Our analysis found that nurse-led education and counseling yields rich exchanges of information, and expressions of thoughts and feelings, among patients and families considering AD biomarker testing. We also found that upon providing comprehensive, protocolized education about amyloid imaging, its indications, and the implications of possible results, a number of patient-specific questions remained. Addressing the questions that matter most to individual patients and families is critical to fostering informed decisions about any clinical or research test or procedure. Our findings showed that nurses who are conducting pre-test counseling for amyloid imaging should, in particular, be equipped to answer questions about: basic neuroanatomy; the spectrum of normal cognitive aging to dementia syndromes; clinical phenotypes and pathological hallmarks of AD and related disorders; secondary prevention of AD and related disorders; and advance planning for persons at risk for cognitive decline. Our findings of concerns about stigma and expressions of fear suggest that emotional support is a key function of nurses providing pre-test counseling. While our analysis focused on amyloid imaging, it is reasonable to expect these findings to extend to other types of AD biomarker testing, including the rapidly developing group of plasma-based AD biomarkers.17

Finally, the high level of engagement by family care partners in this study provides evidence of the crucial role that such individuals play in facilitating informed decision making among persons experiencing cognitive decline. This finding validate calls for ensuring that every effort should be made to include patients’ families in discussions about AD biomarker testing.18

Limitations of this work included the limited ethno-racial diversity of the sample and the collection of data prior to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of anti-amyloid monoclonal therapeutic agents, suggesting that findings may not extend to all individuals who may be seeking pre-test counseling for AD biomarker testing moving forward.

Conclusion

Given the growing number of FDA approved biomarker tests for AD pathology and increasing evidence of its clinical utility,19,20 nurses who practice in settings where dementia evaluations are conducted may be ideally suited to perform pre-test counseling if biomarker testing is being considered. Thus, there is need for continuing nursing education programming to ensure that the workforce is equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide comprehensive education about AD biomarker testing in an emotionally supportive manner.
