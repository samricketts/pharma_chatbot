The spread of neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau protein aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s and related neurodegenerative diseases. Early oligomerization of tau involves conformational reorganization into parallel β-sheet structures and supramolecular assembly into toxic fibrils. Despite the need for selective inhibitors of tau propagation, β-rich protein assemblies are inherently difficult to target with small molecules. Here, we describe a minimalist approach to mimic the aggregation-prone modules within tau. We carried out a backbone residue scan and show that amide N-amination completely abolishes the tendency of these peptides to self-aggregate, rendering them soluble mimics of ordered β-strands from the tau R2 and R3 domains. Several N-amino peptides (NAPs) inhibit tau fibril formation in vitro. We further demonstrate that NAPs 12 and 13 are effective at blocking the cellular seeding of endogenous tau by interacting with monomeric or fibrillar forms of extracellular tau. Peptidomimetic 12 is serum stable, non-toxic to neuronal cells, and selectivity inhibits the fibrilization of tau over Aβ42. Structural analysis of our lead NAPs shows considerable conformational constraint imposed by the N-amino groups. The described backbone N-amination approach provides a rational basis for the mimicry of other aggregation-prone peptides that drive pathogenic protein assembly.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The higher-order assembly of proteins rich in β structure is correlated with poor prognosis in several neurodegenerative diseases.1-4 Intracellular accumulation of the tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is linked to cognitive dysfunction in over 20 disorders collectively termed “tauopathies”.5-9 The normal function of tau is to stabilize microtubules (MTs), the support structures in axons.10,11 Pathogenic misfolding and aggregation can be caused by mutations in the MAPT gene that encodes for tau or by aberrant post-translational modifications.12-16 While toxicity has been associated with various forms of aggregated tau, current data support oligomeric species as a primary driver of neuronal death.17 It is now accepted that tau pathology becomes self-perpetuating, with the capacity to spread from neuron to neuron and cause normal tau to become misfolded (Figure 1A).18-24 Controlling the processes that govern tau fibrilization and cellular propagation is critical for understanding the progression of tauopathies.

Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein harboring up to four MT-binding repeat domains (R1–R4) in the C-terminal half. Like many amyloidogenic proteins, tau fibrilization involves conformational reorganization into β-rich folds, followed by supramolecular assembly into layered parallel β-sheets (Figure 1B).4,25-28 This assembly is driven by favorable H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions between well-defined aggregation-prone hexapeptide motifs in the R2 (275VQIINK280; PHF6*) and R3 (306VQIVYK311; PHF6) domains, which are also essential for MT binding. Short peptide models have long been used to study the structure and function of tau aggregates in vitro. However, direct inhibitors of tau fibrilization are largely limited to dyes and other redoxactive aromatic compounds.29 Conformationally rigid and proteolytically stable peptidomimetics may hold particular promise as ligands of tau and other amyloidogenic proteins that are difficult to target in a sequence-specific manner. The aggregation-prone R2/R3 segments have more recently been used in the structure-based design of modified peptides that inhibit the aggregation of a PHF6 hexapeptide or truncated forms of recombinant tau.30-34 One group recently described a series of peptides capable of blocking the aggregation of full-length tau, as well as seeding in cells.35,36

Despite examples of peptidomimetic disruptors of β-sheet-mediated protein interactions, strategies to translate conformationally extended peptide leads into inhibitors remain limited.37,38 This is due in part to the flexibility and proteolytic instability of short-peptide sequences, coupled with the large surface areas and diverse interaction modes associated with β-sheets.39 The propensity for conformationally extended peptides to aggregate via exposed H-bonding edges presents another significant challenge in the design of soluble β-strand mimics.40 Presentation of a β-strand epitope for protein recognition typically relies on the templating effect of an auxiliary β-strand (as in linear and macrocyclic β-hairpins), intra-strand conformational restriction through covalent tethering, or backbone amide N-alkylation to preclude strand self-aggregation. While backbone amide substitution allows for preservation of side chain functionality, N-methylation (or incorporation of Pro) can promote main chain torsions incompatible with β-sheet mimicry.41-43 So-called “β-breaker” peptidomimetics featuring amide substitutions have previously been developed to target β-amyloid assembly; however, there are currently no such examples capable of blocking the fibrilization or propagation of full-length tau.44-46 Despite numerous studies employing PHF6 and other truncated forms of tau to screen for new ligands, these model systems lack the residues required to adopt disease-associated folds and are incapable of seeding tau aggregation in cells.47,48

We recently described an approach to β-strand stabilization based on peptide backbone N-amination (Figure 1C).42 The conformational and non-aggregating characteristics of N-amino peptides (NAPs) are consistent across distinct models of β-sheet folding and are attributed to cooperative non-covalent interactions involving the Nα-NH2 substituent. These qualities distinguish NAPs from N-alkylated peptides that do not readily adopt or stabilize β-strand conformations. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of NAPs that block tau fibrilization and seeding. Our N-amination strategy enables the use of a tau filament structure to guide the design of its own peptidomimetic ligands. Using biophysical and cellular propagation assays, we demonstrate the utility of a minimalist β-strand mimicry approach to target β-rich amyloids.

RESULTS

Design and Synthesis of NAP-Based Tau Ligands.

The R3 306VQIVYK311 hexapeptide motif is widely accepted as the key amyloidogenic core of tau because filaments formed from this motif closely resemble those observed from Alzheimer’s disease tau.27,47,49 However, recent crystal structures of the R2 275VQIINK280 motif show tighter side chain packing and strand interdigitation relative to the R3 hexapeptide, suggesting it to be a more powerful driver of tau aggregation.35 Since the specific contribution of individual residues in these sequences has not yet been studied, we chose to perform a complete backbone N-amino scan along the length of each hexapeptide. Our NAP-based library included mono-, di-, and tri-N-aminated analogues. We limited poly-N-amino peptides to those harboring amide substitutions on a single H-bonding edge, thus retaining a fully intact edge for interaction with tau.

We synthesized 14 NAP β-strand mimics on a solid support, as described in Figure 2. We excluded analogues harboring N-amino glutamine (aGln) or N-amino asparagine (aAsn) residues since these undergo rapid intraresidue cyclization via the hydrazide during cleavage.50 Our strategy relied on the incorporation of orthogonally protected N-amino dipeptide building blocks that are available in three steps from the corresponding α-amino benzyl esters. Notably, this dipeptide fragment approach allows for Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) of NAPs using automated, microwave-assisted HCTU/NMM condensation protocols on a Rink amide MBHA resin. In contrast to canonical dipeptide (or larger) fragments, N-aminated building blocks are highly resistant to racemization during activation owing to the electron-withdrawing NHBoc substituent.51 Following elongation, NAPs were cleaved from the resin and purified by preparative RP-HPLC. All NAPs were characterized by 1H NMR and HRMS. The parent unmodified hexapeptides AcPHF6 and AcPHF6* were also synthesized for comparison with backbone-aminated variants.

NAP Tau Mimics Inhibit Tau Fibrilization In Vitro.

We chose thioflavin T (ThT), an amyloid specific fluorescent dye that binds to β-sheet assemblies, to first evaluate the effect of NAPs on recombinant tau aggregation. For these studies, we expressed and purified full-length tau featuring a P301L mutation (Figure S1) frequently observed in patients with frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromo-some 17 (FTDP-17).52 This missense mutation leads to local structure destabilization around the amyloid-forming region resulting in faster aggregation. Recombinant tauP301L aggregated in the presence of equimolar heparin sulfate (t1/2 = 6.5 ± 0.4 h) starting with a very short 0.5 h lag phase, followed by a 24 h exponential growth phase. Of the 14 NAPs tested, 6 were found to significantly reduce the end-point ThT fluorescence of tauP301L when incubated at 2-fold molar excess (Figures 3A and S2A). Compounds 2 and 4 are mono- and diaminated hexapeptides derived from the R2 PHF6* aggregation-prone sequence, whereas compounds 5, 6, 12, and 13 are all derived from the R3 PHF6 sequence. Several other NAPs had no effect on end-point ThT fluorescence or lacked consistent inhibition across repeated experiments (Figure S2B,C). In agreement with previous reports,35,53 we observed significant aggregation of both the R2 and R3 parent peptides (AcPHF6* and AcPHF6) when incubated alone in aq. NaOAc buffer, as evidenced by intense ThT fluorescence after 48 h (Figure 3B). In contrast, the six NAP inhibitors mentioned above (2, 4–6, 12, and 13) exhibited no such fluorescence, suggesting that even a single backbone N-amino group was sufficient to confer resistance to self-aggregation.

Although useful in identifying NAPs that have an effect on tauP301L fibrilization, ThT fluorescence data suggested that the formation of tau oligomeric assemblies can still occur in the presence of NAPs. This is consistent with previous reports showing that the end-point ThT fluorescence and fibrilization lag time for full-length tau are particularly resistant to perturbation by inhibitors.35,36 Several peptidomimetic and small-molecule tau aggregation inhibitors are thus highly effective in ThT assays using 3R or other truncated tau isoforms and less so in the presence of 4R tau. To confirm the effect of NAPs on the growth of mature tau fibrils, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualize the morphology and maturity of fibrillar species. Heparin-induced tauP301L fibrils were allowed to grow over 96 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Untreated tauP301L afforded large, helical, and amyloid-like filamentous fibrils. In contrast, we did not observe mature fibril networks in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of the six NAP inhibitors mentioned above. Di-N-aminated peptides 4, 12, and 13 were particularly effective at attenuating fibril growth, resulting in aggregates similar to control wells containing tauP301L without heparin (Figure 4). In the case of the mono-N-aminated peptides (2, 5, and 6), we observed short, immature rod-like fibrils, indicative of a more modest effect on tau assembly (Figure S3).

Di-N-aminated Hexapeptides Block the Cellular Transmission of Tau Fibrils.

Recent studies show that extracellular tau fibrils spread in a prion-like fashion from one cell to the next.18-24 This mode of propagation is important for the spread of NFTs, neuropil threads, and plaque-associated neurites—all of which contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. To test whether NAP inhibitors are able to block the seeding activity of recombinant tauP301L, we employed HEK293 biosensor cells that stably express a tau-yellow fluorescent protein fusion [tau-RD(LM)-YFP].21,22 When we treated these cells with preformed heparin-induced fibrils of tauP301L, we observed a large number of intracellular tau aggregates, as indicated by punctate fluorescence after 48 h. These wells exhibited a mean of 38% aggregate-containing cells over three separate experiments, demonstrating the ability for fibrillar tauP301L to enter cells and seed the aggregation of the endogenous tau-RD(LM)-YFP (Figures 5 and S4). Given their superior anti-fibrillar activity by TEM and reduced peptide character, we elected to carry out cell-seeding experiments with di-N-aminated peptides 4, 12, and 13. Pre-treatment of monomeric tauP301L with 1.9 μM di-NAPs 12 and 13 (derived from the R3 PHF6 motif) significantly reduced seeding capacity. This effect was less pronounced at 0.009 μM. Inhibitor 4, derived from the R2 domain PHF6* motif exhibited far weaker anti-seeding activity at both high and low concentrations (Figures 5 and S4).

Given that pathogenic tau can be secreted from cells in various forms (as oligomers, aggregates, or mature fibrils54), we tested whether NAPs could block the cellular transmission of pre-formed fibrils. In this experiment, NAPs were incubated with mature tauP301L fibrils for 36 h prior to treatment of cells expressing tau-RD(LM)-YFP. Indeed, we found that compounds 12 and 13 were able to effectively inhibit propagation in a dose-dependent manner. We determined a fibril capping IC50 in cells in the 5 μM range across three repeated experiments (Figures 6 and S5). These results demonstrate that our structure-based NAP mimicry approach endows ligands with anti-seeding activity irrespective of the tau aggregation state.

Consistent with the seeding experiments performed above using monomeric tauP301L, di-NAP 4 was generally ineffective at blocking the propagation of pre-formed fibrils (Figures 6 and S5). We then considered the possibility of di-NAPs 12 and 13 entering cells and inhibiting seeding by interacting with endogenous tau-RD(LM)-YFP, rather than with extracellular pre-formed fibrils. We thus repeated the experiment without the 36 h inhibitor + mature fibril co-incubation period. Both di-NAPs 12 and 13 failed to inhibit endogenous tau aggregation in this experiment, suggesting that the compounds interact with extracellular tauP301L to block cellular transmission (Figure S6).

Di-NAPs Are Stable in Human Serum and Non-toxic to Neuronal Cells.

Compounds 12 and 13 feature two hydrazide bonds within the peptidomimetic backbone. Their utility as tau ligands in cell-based experiments would benefit from resistance to proteolytic degradation. We carried out stability studies in human serum and monitored degradation by RP-HPLC (Figure 7A). Both 12 and 13 were found to be remarkably stable in 25% human serum (&gt;83% intact after 24 h). In contrast, an eight-residue control peptide was rapidly degraded over 24 h in the same assay. Although the parent AcPHF6 peptide could not be used as a control due to rapid self-aggregation, the stability of 12 and 13 demonstrates the ability of N-amination to protect against peptide backbone degradation.

Cellular seeding experiments with tauP301L in the presence or absence of di-NAPs 12 and 13 did not result in detectable toxicity to HEK293 biosensor cells (Figure S7A). We carried out MTT assays to ensure that inhibitors 12 and 13 are not toxic to human neural cells. As shown in Figure 7B, 12 and 13 exhibited no appreciable toxicity toward SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells up to 50 μM, or 10-fold their anti-seeding IC50 values.

N-Amination Imparts Backbone Conformational Constraint in Solution.

Di-NAPs that potentially cap mature tau fibrils would be expected to adopt parallel β-sheet-like conformations. X-ray crystallography of a model di-N-aminated tripeptide previously demonstrated its self-association as a dimeric species with extended backbone geometries.42 To gain an insight into the solution structure of our lead tau ligands, we carried out 2D-NMR spectroscopy, followed by simulated annealing. Although AcPHF6 was insoluble in water, we were able to obtain gradient correlation spectroscopy (gCOSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (ROESY) NMR spectra in 9:1 H2O/D2O for 12 and 13. 1H NMR spectra were remarkably well resolved and devoid of significant minor rotamers despite the presence of two N-substituted amide bonds. Moreover, inter-residue nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) were limited to correlations consistent with an extended solution conformation (CαHi → NHi+1). Though short linear peptides are expected to be highly flexible in solution, we observed no NOE correlations characteristic of turn conformations. Distance-restrained simulated annealing and clustering based on backbone dihedral angles afforded ensembles of the three most populated conformers of 12 (Figure 8). These clusters revealed a high convergence of ϕ and ψ torsions within the Gln2 and Val4 residues to the β-sheet region of Ramachandran space. In contrast, the N-aminated aIle3 and aTyr5 residues exhibit greater conformational heterogeneity. This pattern was also observed in the case of di-NAP 13 (Figure S8). To specifically parse the conformational impact of N-amination, we carried out unrestrained conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 12 and AcPHF6. Ramachandran plots for the 400 ns simulation again showed that N-amination severely restricts accessible backbone torsions of the preceding residue (Figure S9). We previously showed that NAPs readily engage in intraresidue C6 H-bonds between the N–NH2 donor and the carbonyl O acceptor, even in protic solvents.55 Coupled with the constraint imposed on the preceding residue, the hydrazide bond thus may serve to further stabilize β-sheet-like conformations that recognize fibrillar tau.

Di-NAP 12 Does Not Inhibit Aβ42 Aggregation In Vitro.

Many small-molecule protein aggregation inhibitors exhibit undesired promiscuity. A peptidomimetic approach to tau inhibition offers prospects for achieving selectivity over other amyloids rich in β structure. As a preliminary test, we selected our best-performing aggregation-inhibitory tau mimic, 12, and determined its effect on Aβ42 aggregation in vitro (Figures 9 and S10). Incubation of synthetic, full-length Aβ42 (40 μM) in the presence of ThT and various concentrations of 12 resulted in strong fluorescence indicative of aggregation. Di-NAP 12 exhibited no inhibitory effect on Aβ42 aggregation up to a 4-fold molar excess (160 μM). We similarly observed no effect on aggregation kinetics at any of the concentrations tested. Compound 12 thus exhibits in vitro selectivity for tau over Aβ42, an amyloid whose parallel β-sheet assembly is also driven by a hydrophobic hexapeptide core motif.

CONCLUSIONS

We have described the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a novel class of β-strand mimics that block tau fibrilization and propagation. Since the physiological relevance of truncated tau fibrilization models has recently been called into question,47 the current study focused on targeting tauP301L, which harbors cross-β residues that are important for adopting pathogenic folds. Using an amide-to-hydrazide replacement strategy, we carried out a positional scan of aggregation-prone peptide sequences derived from the R2 and R3 domains of tau. Several NAP analogues inhibited the fibrilization of recombinant full-length tau as well as its seeding capacity in an in-cell aggregation assay. Key features of the described NAP inhibitors include increased conformational rigidity, resistance toward self-aggregation, and remarkable stability toward serum proteases.

The cell-to-cell propagation of fibrillar tau has emerged as an important target for structure-based ligand design. The majority of small-molecule anti-tau approaches have relied on modulating disease-associated post-translational modifications, targeting intracellular tau to prevent aggregation, or disaggregating mature fibrils.29,56 Ligands such as 12 can block the seeding capacity of extracellular tau fibrils, thus enabling studies on the role that propagation plays in the progression of tauopathies. Importantly, it is estimated that over 99% of endogenous tau is bound to microtubules leaving only a small fraction as free tau within neurons.57,58 Extracellular seed-competent tau is estimated to exist in only picomolar or low nanomolar concentrations in the human brain, even in a pathological state.59,60 Ligands that require stoichiometric quantities to block tau fibril transmission therefore represent viable chemical probes of propagation in cells and in vivo.

Seminal work from the laboratories of Doig44 and Meredith45 demonstrated the utility of peptide backbone N-methylation for the development of inhibitors of Aβ aggregation. Derived from aggregation-prone β-strand sequences, these and related β-breaker peptidomimetics feature backbone substitutions designed to interrupt canonical β-sheet H-bonding patterns on one edge. Although N-methylated PHF6 analogues with anti-aggregation activity against tau are not known, Nowick and co-workers reported β-hairpin macrocycles that bind to AcPHF6 via a recognition strand while inhibiting higher-order assembly.30 More recently, Segal and co-workers developed a proline-containing analogue of PHF6 (Ac-VPIVYK-NH2) that inhibits the aggregation of AcPFH6 in vitro.34 Structure-based side chain mutational strategies35,36 and phage display selection32,61 have been employed to identify larger peptide-based inhibitors of tau with cellular and in vivo efficacy. To our knowledge, NAP-based tau ligands such as 12 and 13 represent the first PHF6 peptidomimetics capable of blocking the fibrilization and cellular propagation of full-length tau.

In using the sequence of tau to guide the design of its own inhibitors, our work also sets the stage for the development of ligands that are selective for other pathogenic amyloids. Our most effective inhibitor of tau fibrilization and seeding showed no effect on the in vitro aggregation of Aβ42. Discrimination between structurally related β-rich assemblies is potentially enabled by NAPs, which exhibit a full complement of side chains in a minimalist single-strand design. Given that disease-associated conformational strains of tau are known to propagate in vivo with high fidelity, we expect that an NAP-based strategy may be used to target unique structural motifs within such polymorphs.62,63

METHODS

Solution-Phase Synthesis Notes.

Unless stated otherwise, reactions were performed in flame-dried glassware under a positive pressure of argon or nitrogen gas using dry solvents. Commercial grade reagents and solvents were used without further purification except where noted. Anhydrous solvents were purchased directly from chemical suppliers. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using silica gel 60 F254 pre-coated plates (0.25 mm). Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel (60 μm particle size). Reaction progress was judged by TLC analysis (single-spot/two-solvent systems) using a UV lamp, CAM (ceric ammonium molybdate), ninhydrin, or basic KMnO4 stain(s) for detection purposes. NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 or 800 MHz spectrometer. Proton chemical shifts are reported as δ values relative to residual signals from deuterated solvents (CDCl3, DMSO-d6, and D2O).

General Procedure for N-Amino Dipeptide Synthesis.

To a solution of amino benzyl ester (HCl salt, 1.0 equiv) in a biphasic mixture of THF and sat. aq. NaHCO3 (1:1), 2-(tert-butyl)-3,3-diethyl-1,2-oxaziridine-2,3,3-tricarboxylate64 (1.1 equiv) was added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at rt for 4 h. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc and the aqueous layer drained. The organic layer was washed with additional water, then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification by flash chromatography over silica gel (15–50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the hydrazino ester as a clear oil (75–95% yield).

A solution of Fmoc amino acid (1.2 equiv) in DCM was treated with 1-chloro-N,N,2-trimethyl-1-propenylamine65 (1.6 equiv) and stirred for 10 min. The solution was then transferred into a flask containing a mixture of the hydrazino ester prepared above (1 equiv) and NaHCO3 (3 equiv) in DCM. The reaction was stirred for 6 h and quenched with water. The organic layer was collected and the aq. phase extracted with additional DCM. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification by silica gel flash chromatography (15–75% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the protected N-amino dipeptide as an off-white solid (73–82% yield).

To a solution of the protected N-amino dipeptide prepared above (1.0 equiv) in EtOAc was added 10% Pd/C (150 mg/mmol), and the mixture was stirred under a H2 atmosphere at rt for 6 h. The reaction was diluted with additional EtOAc, filtered through Celite, and concentrated. Purification by flash chromatography (25–100% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the aminated carboxylic acid as a white solid (68–94%).

Solid-Phase Synthesis of NAPs.

The SPPS was carried out on CEM’s Liberty Blue peptide synthesizer with an Fmoc-capped polystyrene Rink amide MBHA resin (100–200 mesh, 0.05–0.15 mmol scale). The following amino acid derivatives suitable for Fmoc SPPS were used: Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Asn(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Val-OH, and Fmoc-Ile-OH. The dry resin was washed with DMF three times and allowed to swell in DMF for 5 min at elevated temperature prior to use. All reactions were carried out using gentle agitation. Fmoc deprotection steps were carried out by treating the resin with a solution of 20% piperidine/DMF (5 min × 2). Coupling of Fmoc-protected amino acids as well as Fmoc-(N′-Boc)-hydrazino dipeptide acids was effected using 5 equiv of HCTU (0.5 M in DMF), 10 equiv. of NMM (1.0 M in DMF), and 5 equiv of the carboxylic acid in DMF at 50 °C (10 min). After each reaction, the resin was washed with DMF two times and DCM two times. N-Terminal acetylation was carried out with 20 equiv of Ac2O and 40 equiv of pyridine at rt in DCM (10 min, two times), followed by washing with DCM five times. Peptides were cleaved from the resin by incubating with gentle stirring in 2 mL of 95:2.5:2.5 TFA/H2O/TIPS at rt for 2 h. The cleavage mixture was filtered, and the resin was rinsed with an additional 1 mL of cleavage solution. The filtrate was treated with 8 mL of cold Et2O to induce precipitation. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was removed. The remaining solid was washed two more times with Et2O and dried under vacuum. Peptides were analyzed and purified on C12 RP-HPLC columns (preparative: 4μ, 90 Å, 250 × 21.2 mm; analytical: 4μ, 90 Å, 150 × 4.6 mm) using linear gradients of MeCN/H2O (with 0.1% formic acid), then lyophilized to afford white powders. All peptides were characterized by LC–MS (ESI), HRMS (ESI-TOF), and 1H NMR. Analytical HPLC samples for all purified peptides were prepared as 1 mM in MeCN. Linear gradients of MeCN in H2O (0.1% formic acid) were run over 20 or 12 min, and the spectra are provided for λ = 220 nm.

tauP301L Expression and Purification.

Human tauP301L (0N4R) was cloned into pET28b with an N-terminal His6 tag. Briefly, transformed BL21 (DE3) cells were grown in LB + kanamycin medium at 37 °C until OD600 reached 0.8 and was then induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 16 °C. Cells were then harvested, resuspended, and lysed by probe sonication in the lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and Roche cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail, with the pH adjusted to 8.0. The lysate was then boiled for 20 min in a water bath, and the debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000g for about 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained was then injected into a 5 mL IMAC Ni-charged affinity column and eluted over a gradient of 10–200 mM imidazole. Eluted tau-containing fractions were further purified using GE HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 high-resolution size exclusion chromatography columns in a storage buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT, with the pH adjusted to 7.6. The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis, and the concentration was estimated using BCA assay.

ThT Fluorescence Aggregation Assay.

Recombinant tauP301L (10 μM final concentration) and NAP inhibitors (20 μM final concentration) were mixed in an aggregation buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, 10 μM ThT, 10 μM heparin, 2 mM DTT, and 0.5% DMSO, pH: 7.4) in a 96-well clear bottom black plate with a final reaction volume of 200 μL. The plate was then sealed with a clear sealing film and allowed to incubate at 37 °C with continuous shaking in a Biotek Synergy H1 microplate reader. An automated method was used to carry out ThT fluorescence measurements at an excitation wavelength of 444 nm and an emission wavelength of 485 nm at an interval of every 5 min for 48 h. Experiments were carried out in technical replicates on at least 2 different days. Every experiment included control wells that lacked tauP301L, heparin, or NAPs. The average signal from control wells lacking tau was used to subtract the background fluorescence, and the average of the first and last 10 data points of tau + heparin (no inhibitor) wells, after blank subtraction, was used to normalize the data. All data plots were generated with SigmaPlot.

Transmission Electron Microscopy.

For analyzing fibrils by TEM, aggregation was carried out under conditions similar to the assay performed above but with ThT excluded and a final reaction volume of 100 μL. Samples were incubated in a microcentrifuge tube for 4 days at 37 °C with a mixing speed of 100 rpm. A 10 μL aliquot of the sample was then applied to 400-meshed formvar-/carbon-coated copper grids and negative-stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Micrographs were obtained on a JEOL 2011 transmission electron microscope at 200 kV.

Cellular Seeding Assay.

The tauP301L was diluted to a final concentration of 10 μM in an aggregation buffer containing 100 mM sodium acetate, 10 μM heparin, and 2 mM DTT, pH: 7.4. The protein was incubated in a microcentrifuge tube for 4 days at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 100 rpm. Control vials included those wherein (1) buffer was added in place of tauP301L and (2) buffer was added in place of heparin.

HEK293 cells stably expressing tau-RD (LM)-YFP were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% Glutamax in a 75 cm2 cell culture flask under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For each experiment, cells were plated at a density of 15,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates.

For seeding by monomeric tau, freshly purified recombinant tauP301L was co-incubated with heparin and NAPs for 4 days in an aggregation buffer at 37 °C (see the above section). Following incubation, the reaction mixture was diluted in the low-serum Opti-MEM medium, mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 in a 20:1 ratio (complex/Lipofectamine) and allowed to incubate for an additional 20 min at rt. A mixture of 0.19 μM tau + 1.9 μM or 0.009 μM inhibitors (final concentrations) was added to the cells. Cells were incubated for an additional 48 h before taking measurements on a BioTek Cytation 5 cell imager and a microplate reader. 10 × 10 pictures/well were taken at 20× magnification under an FITC channel, and the punctate counting was carried out using built-in software. Each data set was collected from technical replicates on at least 2 different days. Every experiment included control wells (no tau, no heparin, and no NAP). All data plots were generated with SigmaPlot. Error bars shown are standard deviation from technical replicates.

For seeding experiments with fibrillar tau, recombinant tauP301L fibrils were prepared as described above (see the section on fibril formation) and sonicated for 3 min prior to use in this assay. In a reaction volume of 40, 8 μL of fibrils was diluted with 31 μL of low-serum Opti-MEM medium and then mixed with 1 μL of NAPs (DMSO concentration was constant across various concentrations of inhibitors). The reaction mixture was then allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 36 h, then mixed with 2 μL of Lipofectamine 2000, and further incubated for 20 min at rt. A 10 μL aliquot of this mixture was then added to 90 μL of cells (15,000 cells/well). Cells were incubated for additional 48 h before taking measurements on a BioTek Cytation 5 cell imager and a microplate reader. 10 × 10 pictures/well were taken at 20× magnification under an FITC channel, and the punctate counting were carried out using built-in software. Each data set were collected from technical replicates on at least 2 different days. Every experiment had a tau control well (no tau but rest all), a heparin control well (no heparin but rest all), and a Tau alone well (no inhibitors but rest all). Every experiment included control wells (no tau, no heparin, and no NAP). All data plots were generated with SigmaPlot. IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data set using the sigmoidal logistic four-parameter equation. Error bars represent standard deviation from technical replicates.

Human Serum Stability Assay.

The stability of NAPs in 25% human serum (MilliporeSigma) was assessed by HPLC. The reaction was started by adding NAPs at a final concentration of 500 μM in pre-warmed serum. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A 100 μL aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken out at 0, 1, 4, and 24 h and was mixed with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min to precipitate serum proteins. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and mixed with an internal standard (1 mg/mL Cbz-Tyr-OH dissolved in MeCN) and stored at −20 °C. Samples were then analyzed by LC–MS, and the percentage of peptide remaining was calculated by integrating peaks.

MTT Cell Viability Assay.

MTT cell viability assays were carried out on both HEK293 cells stably expressing tau-RD (LM)-YFP and SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were cultured in the DMEM/F12 complete medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% Glutamax in a 75 cm2 cell culture flask under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined using the MTT reduction assay. Briefly, 15,000 cells/well were plated in a 96-well tissue culture plate and were allowed to incubate overnight in a CO2 incubator. The medium was aspirated and the NAP inhibitor prepared in complete medium was added at a given final concentration. The plate was then allowed to incubate for additional 48 h in a CO2 incubator, and the medium was aspirated again and replaced with 0.5 mg/mL MTT prepared in complete medium and incubated for additional 3 h. The medium was then replaced with DMSO to dissolve formazan crystals, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Synergy H1 microplate reader. Each data set was collected from technical replicates on at least 2 different days.

NOESY NMR Acquisition Parameters.

Purified peptides 12 and 13 were dissolved in 9:1 H2O/D2O or DMSO-d6. The final peptide concentration was 1 mM, determined by mass. Data were collected at 25 °C on a 500 MHz Bruker ASCEND, 11.74 T; narrow bore, 54 mm; BOSS-3 36 shim system; BSMS shim and digital lock control units with a 5 mm direct detect SMART probe (1H/13C/15N with Z axis PFG), or an 800 MHz AVANCE II with UltraStabilized and UltraShield (18.79 T), 54 mm bore, a BOSS-2 34 shim system, and a 5 mm broad band (BBO) 15N-31P, 1H decoupling, Z-axis PFG. The TOCSY used a mixing time of 80 ms, and the ROESY had a mixing time of 200 ms. In the f2 direction, the TOCSY and ROESY had 2048 complex points collected, and in the f1 direction, 512 complex points were collected. Watergate 3-9-19 was used for solvent suppression where appropriate. Bruker TopSpin 4.0 or Mestrenova 10.0 software was used to process the data, and Gaussian functions were used before Fourier transformation.

MD Simulations.

Simulated annealing was done with NOE distance and dihedral restraints. The simulated annealing protocol includes the following steps: (1) initial structures of 12 and 13 were prepared using Maestro (version 12.6.149, Schrödinger, LLC). (2) Each initial structure was first energy minimized in vacuum. (3) Next, beginning with the minimized structure, 100 replicas were generated with different initial velocities, and each replica was heated from 300 to 800 K in 100 ps and simulated at 800 K for another 100 ps. (4) After annealing, each replica was solvated. The dimensions of the box were chosen such that the distance between the walls of the box and any atom of the compound was at least 1.0 nm. Minimal counterions were added to neutralize the net charge of the system. The entire system was then energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm to remove any bad contacts. (5) Next, the system underwent a 500 ps NVT equilibration at 300 K. (6) Lastly, the system was annealed from 300 to 500 K and then subsequently down to 5 K over 1 ns in an NPT ensemble (the temperature was increased from 300 to 500 K in the first 100 ps, maintained at 500 K for 100 ps, decreased to 300 K in the following 500 ps, maintained at 300 K for 100 ps, and then decreased to 5 K in the last 200 ps). (7) After all the simulation steps, the final frames from each of the 100 trajectories were used for the analysis.

GROMACS 4.6.7 suite with the OPLS2005 force field with a TIP4P water model was used for the simulations.66-68 The topology file for each compound was generated using the Schrödinger utility ffld_server and converted to the GROMACS format using the ffconv.py script.69 Throughout the simulated annealing protocol, NOE-derived distance restraints were applied to the compound with a force constant of 10,000 kJ·mol−1·nm−2. The force constant for dihedral restraints was 1000 kJ·mol−1·rad−2. The temperature was regulated using a v-rescale thermostat, with a coupling time constant of 0.1 ps. The pressure was regulated using a Berendsen barostat, with a time coupling constant of 2.0 ps and an isothermal compressibility of 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1. The leapfrog algorithm with an integration time step of 2 fs was used to evolve the dynamics of the system. The linear constraint solver (LINCS) algorithm was used to constrain all bonds containing hydrogens to the equilibrium bond lengths. For simulations in vacuum, the cutoffs of all non-bonded (electrostatic and van der Waals) interactions were set to 999.0 nm, and the neighbor list was constructed only once and never updated. For simulations in solvent, all non-bonded interactions as well as neighbor searching were truncated at 1.0 nm. Long-range electrostatics beyond 1.0 nm were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method with a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm and an interpolation order of 4. To account for truncation of the Lennard-Jones interactions, a long-range analytic dispersion correction was applied to both energy and pressure.

Dihedral principal component analysis was performed on the backbone (ϕ, ψ) angles of residues V, Q, I, V, Y, and K of 12 and 13. The first three principal components were used for further cluster analysis.70,71 The population for each cluster was calculated. For 12, 99 structures were grouped into 18 clusters. For 13, 87 structures were grouped into 16 clusters.

Conventional MD Simulations.

Conventional MD simulations were performed for AcPHF6 and 12. The initial structures were built using Maestro (version 12.6.149, Schrödinger, LLC). All MD simulations in this study were performed using the GROMACS 4.6.7 suite with the OPLS 2005 force field and the TIP4P water model.66-68 The topology file for each compound was generated using the Schrödinger utility ffld_server and converted to the GROMACS format using the ffconv.py script.69 Each initial structure was first energy minimized for 10,000 steps and then solvated in a cubic box of water molecules. The box size was chosen such that the distance between the compound and the box wall was at least 1.0 nm. Minimal explicit counterions were also added to neutralize the net charge of the system. With all heavy atoms restrained, the solvated system was further energy minimized for 5000 steps. With all the heavy atoms remaining restrained to their initial coordinates, a 50 ps NVT equilibration at 300 K was performed, followed by a 50 ps NPT equilibration at 300 K and 1 bar to adjust the solvent density. Then, the position restraints on heavy atoms were removed. The system underwent a further equilibration process in the NVT ensemble for 100 ps and in the NPT ensemble for 100 ps. The equilibrated system then underwent a 500 ns production run in the NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar. In all the simulations, the temperature was regulated using the v-rescale thermostat with a coupling time constant of 0.1 ps. To avoid the “hot solvent/cold solute” artifacts, two separated thermostats were applied to the solvent (water and ions) and the compound. For the NPT simulations, the pressure was maintained using the isotropic Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a coupling time of 2.0 ps and a compressibility of 4.5 × 10−5 bar−1. Bonds involving hydrogen were constrained using the LINCS algorithm. A 2 fs time step was used with the leapfrog integrator. The nonbonded interactions (Lennard-Jones and electrostatic) were truncated at 1.0 nm. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald summation method with a Fourier spacing of 0.12 nm and an interpolation order of 4. A long-range analytic dispersion correction was applied to both the energy and pressure to account for the truncation of Lennard-Jones interactions. The last 400 ns of each production run was used for further analysis..

Figure 3. Inhibition of tau P301L aggregation and monomeric nature of inhibitors examined using ThT fluorescence: (A) Incubation of 20 μM inhibitors with 10 μM heparin-treated tauP301L significantly reduced ThT fluorescence. (B) N-Amino substitution completely abolished the aggregation propensity of AcPHF6 and AcPHF6*, as determined by negligible ThT fluorescence after 48 h.

Figure 4. Fibril morphology under a transmission electron microscope. Left to right: Incubation of 10 μM tauP301L resulted in large, mature, and filamentous fibrils only in the presence of heparin. Addition of 20 μM NAP inhibitors 4, 12, and 13 afforded non-fibrillary amorphous aggregates similar to control. Scale bar represents a distance of 500 nm in the tau + hep panel and 2 μm in the other panels.

Figure 5. Inhibition of tauP301L aggregation and seeding. Soluble monomeric tauP301L (0.19 μM) in the presence of heparin was co-incubated with 0.009 μM or 1.9 μM inhibitors for 4 days and then added to HEK293 cells stably expressing tau-RD (P301L/V337M)-YFP. Fibrillar tauP301L can induce the aggregation of endogenous tau in cells seen as focal puncta with high fluorescence. Shown here are representative images of cells, at 20× magnification under FITC channel. Treatment with 1.9 μM of either 12 or 13 was sufficient to prevent seeding; however, 4 was found to be ineffective. Scale bar represents 200 μm. Bar graphs show the number of intracellular fluorescent puncta relative to control infection wells lacking the inhibitor.

Figure 6. Concentrations of NAP inhibitors required to block seeding by pre-formed 0.19 μM tauP301L fibrils in HEK293 cells expressing tau-RD (P301L/V337M)-YFP. Mature fibrils were treated with various concentrations of NAPs for 36 h, added to cells, and incubated for an additional 48 h. Punctate fluorescence was quantified to derive % tau infection relative to fibrils untreated with NAPs.

Figure 7. Serum stability and cytotoxicity of NAP inhibitors: (A) NAPs 12 and 13 remained &gt;80% intact after 24 h of incubation in 25% human serum, whereas the control peptide (H-LITRLENT-NH2) was rapidly degraded, as measured by HPLC. (B) NAPs 12 and 13 did not exhibit any appreciable toxicity toward human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells at low (10 μM) or high (50 μM) concentrations after 48 h, as determined by MTT assay.

Figure 8. Solution NMR-derived structural ensemble of 12: (A) Sequential and medium- to long-range NOEs observed in the ROESY spectrum along with the 3JNH-CαH coupling constant were used to derive distance and dihedral restraints for simulated annealing. About 100 energy-minimized structures were calculated and grouped into 18 clusters. Structures of top three clusters are shown with their populations and average backbone root-mean-square deviation relative to the cluster average.
