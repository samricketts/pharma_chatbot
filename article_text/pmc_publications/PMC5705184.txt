The World Alzheimer Report 2015 estimates that dementia has a prevalence of 46.8 million and an incidence of 9.9 million individuals worldwide, costing $ 818 billion (USD) a year [1]. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, presumed to representing 60-80% of all dementia cases. Yet, this progressive neurodegenerative disorder is presently incurable and treatable only with medications that address symptoms but not progression. The need for more effective AD therapeutic interventions is becoming more pronounced as the patient population is expected to double every 20 years [1].

While Dr. Alois Alzheimer reported the first case of AD in 1906, the next breakthrough only occurred in the mid-1980's when amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) were identified as the major constituent of brain senile plaques [2]. The following years saw the development of the amyloid cascade hypothesis which places Aβ as the factor causing or contributing AD pathogenesis and other downstream pathological changes [3]. Based on this hypothesis, preventing Aβ deposition and removing senile plaques should halt AD and patients would recover cognitive abilities.

For more than a decade, anti-Aβ approaches have dominated the arena of AD therapeutics. These include anti-production based approaches (e.g. beta amyloid cleaving enzyme 1 [BACE1] inhibitors, and gamma secretase inhibitors and modulators), and aggregation prevention/ clearance-based approaches (e.g. monoclonal antibodies in passive immunizations and vaccines in active immunizations). As of 2015, BACE1 inhibitors have yet to demonstrate clinical efficacy in Phase III trials. Gamma secretase inhibitors (e.g. semagacestat) and modulators (e.g. tarenflurbil) have failed to reach cognitive improvements [4, 5]. Several anti-Aβ humanized monoclonal antibodies have been tested, including bapineuzamab, solanazumab, gantanerumab, crenezumab, ponazumab, BIIB037 and others. However, on the basis of Phase III studies for bapineuzamab [6] and solanazumab [7], neither passive, nor active immunizations paradigms have met primary pre-specified endpoints in the already completed clinical trials nor have they been shown to alter the course of AD-related dementia in a statistically significant manner. Because of the lack of clinical efficacy, anti-Aβ approaches are being reconsidered in terms of timing [8] and specificity of treatment [9].

Thus, there is a need and a growing interest in pursuing novel AD therapeutics that are not anchored in amyloid. Given the pitfalls in the amyloid cascade hypothesis in providing a robust class of disease modifying drugs against AD progression, alternative therapeutic targets have emerged for the possible treatment of AD. In this special edition of CAR, researchers and investigators review and present treatments at the leading edge of AD clinical trials that are not anchored in the anti-amyloid approach.

The first two papers present new perspectives on the device-based treatments for AD; a relatively novel and under-explored area in AD therapeutics. The report by Xu and Ponce [10] reintroduces and expands upon the burgeoning topic of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for AD. DBS is already approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and tremors, and was shown to be effective in dystonia. Because DBS was found to stimulate memory circuitry serendipitously, it is now being explored as a putative treatment for AD metabolism and cognition. Another device-based treatment reviewed by Gonsalvez, et al. [11] is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is currently approved for the treatment of depression. Preliminary studies show that TMS is safe and well tolerated, with the potential to induce a clinical signal in less than 90 days. Mechanistically, the approach that is speculated is that it increases metabolism and potentially long term potentiation (LTP).

In returning to pharmacotherapy, some of the compounds at the forefront of drug discovery and development are reviewed and presented. Kamkwalala and Newhouse [12] revisit cholinergically based pharmacotherapies. Since acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstay of approved pharmacological treatments for AD and are marketed as symptomatic treatments, it will be interesting to the readership to learn about the development of novel cholinergic-based drugs for AD. Specifically, there are novel nicotinic agonists and other classes of cholinergically stimulating compounds that are involved in the development of the treatment of AD. They might improve the specificity of this approach or augment current treatment.

In their review, Krishnan and colleagues [13] explore an innovative approach to treatment by evaluating the conformations of misfolded proteins. Currently, targeted pharmacotherapy tends to focus on the termini of proteins or receptor channels in their primary structure. Instead, this paper discusses the development of therapeutics recognizing the conformation of homomeric and heteromeric targets.

Next, a paper from our group reports data from a Phase II randomized clinical trial assessing the safety, tolerability and efficacy of thalidomide in the treatment of AD. In a dose escalation approach, it is apparent that thalidomide is poorly tolerated in subjects with AD [14]. Building up on our experience with thalidomide, we discuss the rationale for inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, and its receptor I (TNFRI), to manage the chronic central inflammation associated with AD [15].

Finally, there is a rationale for intervening earlier in the disease, perhaps preceding or at the advent of symptoms. In a provocative paper by Hsu and Marshall [16] (2015), the authors summarized the rapidly emerging and changing field of prevention research. This is a hot topic since many trials underway and soon to begin are testing the principle of risk reduction or delay in the onset of symptoms.

In summary, the development of novel pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions would be more fruitful if multi-target therapies were introduced and unexplored mechanisms of action were expanded upon. In point of fact, the future of AD therapeutics might be akin to chemotherapy where there is not one drug to treat the disease but several simultaneously. What is unknown at this time is the combination of drugs, the doses and durations and the potential side effects above and beyond the known side effects of currently approved medications.
