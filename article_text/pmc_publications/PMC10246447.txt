Background:

Some studies suggest that ambient particulate air pollution is associated with cognitive decline. However, the findings are mixed, and there is no relevant research examining the influences of ultrafine particles (UFP), which may have more toxicity than larger particles. We therefore conducted this study to investigate whether residential UFP exposure is associated with cognitive decline using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers in the United States.

Methods:

This is a longitudinal study of participants who were aged 65 years and older and had normal cognitive status at baseline. Residential UFP exposure, expressed as particle number concentrations (PNC), was assessed in 2016–2017 using a nationwide land use regression model, and was assigned to each participant using their 3-digit residential ZIP codes. Cognitive functions including memory, attention, language, executive function, and global function were assessed annually using 15 neuropsychological tests from March 2015 to February 2022. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the associations after adjustment for covariates including baseline age, sex, APOE ε4 status, race, education, smoking status, history of diabetes, quartiles of neighborhood median household income, and interaction terms of follow-up time with each covariate.

Results:

This study included 5646 participants (mean age 76 years, 65% female). On average, each participant had 4 annual visits. When PNC was treated as a continuous variable, there were no statistically or clinically significant changes in annual decline of each cognitive function in relation to an interquartile range elevation in PNC (4026 particles/cm3). Similarly, when PNC was treated as a categorical variable including five exposure groups, there were no linear exposure-response trends in annual decline of each cognitive function across the five exposure groups.

Conclusions:

This study found no meaningful associations between residential UFP exposure and cognitive decline in global and domain-specific functions. There is a need for further research that assigns UFP exposure at a finer geographic scale.

pmc1. Introduction

Age-related cognitive decline and dementia is an emerging public health problem worldwide, imposing enormous health, social, and economic costs [1]. Dementia is a major cause of disability and dependency among older people age 65 and older [2]. The World Health Organization estimated that currently more than 55 million people live with dementia globally, and about 10 million new cases are diagnosed every year [1,2]. With the increase in life expectancy and the older population, age-related cognitive decline and dementia will become increasingly important. It is projected that worldwide the number of people with dementia will increase to 153 million by 2050 [3]. The risk of dementia increases with age, and there is currently no effective cure for the condition. However, increasing evidence has suggested that it is plausible to prevent or delay cognitive decline and dementia by targeting various modifiable risk factors including environmental risk factors [4–6].

Ambient particulate air pollution is a major environmental risk for public health [7], and has been associated with multiple chronic conditions including cardiovascular diseases [8–11], chronic lung diseases [12,13], diabetes [14,15], and chronic inflammation and oxidative stress [10,11,16,17]. Some longitudinal studies have found that ambient particulate air pollution is associated with cognitive decline [18–21]. However, it is notable that the previous findings are heterogeneous [22], some longitudinal studies did not find the association [23–26]. Furthermore, the previous studies have assessed exposure to particulate air pollution using particle mass concentration.

To our knowledge, there is no existing research examining the association between ultrafine particles (particles smaller than 100 nm, UFP) and cognitive decline. Some evidence has shown that UFP may have more toxicity than larger particles due to their greater ability in penetration and deposition, and larger surface area to interact with cell membranes [27,28]. Therefore, we conducted this longitudinal analysis to investigate whether residential exposure to higher levels of UFP is associated with accelerated decline in global and domain-specific cognitive functions using a sample of participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) in the United States [29].

2. Material and methods

2.1. Study participants

In collaboration with ADRCs across the United States, the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) at the University of Washington has regularly collected standardized clinical and neuropathological research data from 2005 using the Uniform Data Set (UDS) forms [30]. The participants were recruited by each ADRC from multiple sources including clinician referral, self-referral by participants or family members, and active recruitment in the community organizations. There were two groups of participants in the sample: one group included individuals with impaired cognition ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia; the other group included individuals who had normal cognitive function and were used as healthy controls for studying age-related cognitive decline and transitions to dementia. During annual visits at ADRC clinics, participants’ demographics, medical history, neurological examination, and neuropsychological assessment data were collected by trained clinic personnel [31]. This was an open cohort, participants could dynamically enter or leave the cohort at different points of time. We acquired data from the NACC, which cover a follow-up period from 2005 until February 2022. This study was conducted using publicly accessible de-identified data, thus institutional ethics approval was not required.

In March 2015, the ADRCs implemented the UDS version 3 [32], which included substantial revisions on the neuropsychological test battery [33]. We thus restricted our analysis to participants who used the UDS version 3 or later. Starting from March 2015, the first visit was treated as baseline visit for each participant. During the follow-up period from March 2015 to February 2022, we selected participants and the data records according to the following criteria: (1) aged 65 years and older at baseline; (2) had normal cognitive status at baseline (clinical diagnosis of cognitive status was normal [NACCUDSD = 1] and the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating was 0 [CDRSUM = 0]); (3) had complete residential ZIP codes and the exposure data (lived in the contiguous US); (4) had complete data on covariates; and (5) had at least 2 visits and relevant neuropsychological tests during the follow-up period (Figure 1).

2.2. Study design

Our analysis is longitudinal with repeated measures of cognitive functions. Residential UFP exposure was assessed in 2016–2017 using a nationwide land use regression model (LUR) [34]. The exposure estimates were assigned to participants using their 3-digit residential ZIP codes. Global and domain-specific cognitive functions were assessed every year using 15 neuropsychological tests during the follow-up period from March 2015 to February 2022 [33]. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the associations of UFP exposure with annual decline of each cognitive function [35].

2.3. Ultrafine particles assessment

UFP are too small for mass-based measurement to appropriately reflect the levels of UFP in the air, they are better measured using particle number concentrations (PNC). Residential UFP exposure was assessed using a nationwide LUR model [34], which was developed in 2016–2017 to estimate annual average outdoor PNC at census block level in the contiguous United States. The model was able to explain 77% of spatial variability of annual average PNC (R2 = 0.77, root-mean-square error = 2400 particles/cm3) [34]. We obtained the census-block-level PNC and population data, assigned the data to the corresponding 3-digit ZIP code areas, and calculated population-weighted average annual PNC at each 3-digit ZIP code area: C=∑Pi×Ci∑Pi

where Pi is the number of people living in a census block, Ci is census-block-level PNC. The exposure data were assigned to each participant using their 3-digit residential ZIP codes. The population-weighted average PNC at each 3-digit ZIP code area took into account both the PNC and the number of people at each census block, and thus could more accurately (vs arithmetic mean PNC) reflect human UFP exposure at each 3-digit ZIP code area.

2.4. Cognitive function assessment

Numerous neuropsychological tests were administered for participants during annual visits at ADRC clinics between March 2015 and February 2022 [33]. Following the previous studies [18–21], we assessed four domain-specific cognitive functions including memory (4 tests), attention (4 tests), language (5 tests), and executive function (2 tests) using 15 tests available in the UDS version 3 or later (Table 1). For each test, we calculated standardized z scores using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the original measures at baseline. For the Trail Making Test Part A and Part B, the distributions of the original scores were right skewed, thus log-transformed data were used to calculate z scores. Furthermore, we calculated means of z scores of all 15 tests or relevant tests in each domain to assess global and domain-specific cognitive functions at the time of each visit (Table 1).

2.5. Covariates

We retrieved baseline information on the potential confounding factors including age, sex (male, female), apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status defined as the presence of at least one ε4 allele (yes, no), race/ethnicity (white, black, other), education (years), smoking status (current, former, never), and history of diabetes (yes, no). In addition, we added quartiles of neighborhood median household income at 3-digit ZIP code areas to reflect neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), which were developed using the 2010 census-tract-level median household income data [36].

2.6. Statistical analyses

We divided study participants into quintiles according to their average PNC levels during the follow-up period, and compared personal and neighborhood characteristics at baseline and average cognitive scores during the follow-up period between the five exposure groups. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine the associations of UFP exposure with annual decline of each cognitive function after accounting for the repeated measures correlation [35]. Exposure-related change in annual decline of each cognitive function was expressed in the model using an interaction term between follow-up time and the exposure variable. We first treated PNC as a continuous variable to examine linear relationships, we examined changes in annual decline of each cognitive function in relation to an interquartile range (IQR) elevation in PNC during the follow-up period. Furthermore, we treated PNC as a categorical variable including five exposure groups to examine potential nonlinear relationships and exposure-response trends. We calculated differences in annual decline of each cognitive function during the follow-up period for each exposure group by using the group with the lowest exposure as the reference group.

We used three models to examine how covariates would influence effect estimates. Model 1 was an unadjusted model including participant-specific random intercept, participant-specific random slop for follow-up time, PNC, follow-up time, and an interaction term between PNC and follow-up time. Model 2 was based on model 1 and additionally adjusted for baseline age, sex, APOE ε4 status, and 3 interaction terms of follow-up time with each covariate. Model 3 was based on model 2 and additionally adjusted for race, education, smoking status, history of diabetes, quartiles of neighborhood median household income, and 5 interaction terms of follow-up time with each covariate. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and were conducted using the R statistical computing environment, version 4.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The lme4 package (version 1.1–31) for linear mixed-effects models was used in the main statistical analysis [35].

3. Results

3.1. Characteristics of study participants

During the study period, there were 8685 participants who were aged 65 years and older and had normal cognitive status at baseline, and had complete PNC exposure data. After excluding those with missing data on covariates and those with less than 2 visits and neuropsychological tests (n = 3039), leaving 5646 participants for the analysis of global function (the sample size was 4939 for memory, 4953 for attention, 5645 for language, and 5422 for executive function) (Figure 1). Compared with excluded participants, included participants were more likely to be White, and had better global and domain-specific cognitive functions at baseline (eTable 1).

These participants lived in 451 different 3-digit ZIP code areas during the follow-up period (Figure 2); the median of surface areas was 3310 km2 (IQR 754 – 7495 km2) (1278 mi2, 291 – 2894 mi2). There were a total of 22,517 visits; each participant, on average, had 4 visits; the average follow-up time was 3.5 years (SD 1.6 years). Based on individual visits, the average PNC was 8196 particles/cm3 (IQR 6305 – 10,331 particles/cm3, range 2342 – 14,663 particles/cm3).

At baseline, the average age was 76.0 years (SD 7.3 years), average education was 16.2 years (SD 2.8 years). The five exposure groups had similar average age and education (Table 2). Overall, 65% of the participants were female, 81% were White, 29% carried at least one APOE ε4 allele, and 16% had diabetes. Compared with those in the lowest exposure quintile, participants in the highest exposure quintile were less likely to be White or be an APOE ε4 carrier, and were more likely to be female, Black, and live in a higher SES neighborhood. The distributions of smoking status and history of diabetes were similar across the five exposure groups (Table 2). For the five cognitive functions, the highest exposure quintile consistently had worse global function and domain-specific functions including memory, attention, language, and executive function compared with the lowest exposure quintile (Table 2).

3.2. Ultrafine particles and cognitive decline

When PNC was treated as a continuous variable and adjusted for the covariates (Table 3), there were no significant changes in annual decline of memory, attention, language, and global function in relation to an IQR elevation in PNC (4026 particles/cm3). Executive function was significantly improved, but the magnitude was small and not clinically meaningful (Table 3). In addition, APOE ε4 status and age were consistently associated with faster annual declines of each domain-specific and global cognitive function. History of diabetes was associated with faster annual decline in language. Current smokers had faster annual decline in memory and executive function, former smokers had slightly faster decline in language. Whereas living in the highest or third quartile of neighborhood median household income was associated with slower annual decline in executive function (Table 3).

When PNC was treated as a categorical variable including five exposure groups (Table 4), there were no linear exposure-response trends in differences of domain-specific and global cognitive declines across the five exposure groups. In addition, the magnitudes of the differences in annual cognitive declines were small, and mostly not statistically significant.

3.3. Sensitivity analyses

The relationship of PNC with each specific neuropsychological test in a domain was not completely consistent with the relationship between PNC and the domain-specific function (eTable 2). When cognitive functions were measured using the original scores, the results were similar to those based on standardized z scores (eTable 3). Furthermore, the results did not substantially change across the three statistical models with different adjustments for covariates (eTable 2, eTable 3).

4. Discussion

In this longitudinal analysis of older people with normal cognitive status at baseline, we used a nationwide LUR model to estimate residential UFP exposure, and investigated whether UFP exposure was associated with cognitive decline. We found no meaningful associations between residential UFP exposure and annual decline in global and domain-specific cognitive functions.

Our findings are consistent with some previous longitudinal studies [23–26], which also suggested null associations between particulate air pollution and cognitive decline. Based on the same cohort and similar study methods, Cleary et al. did not find significant associations between residential fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and cognitive decline [23]. Similarly, two large longitudinal studies in the US [24] and UK [25] found no significant associations between residential PM2.5 and cognitive decline.

In addition, some longitudinal studies reported no significant associations of cognitive decline with traffic-related air pollution indicated by traffic proximity [19], black carbon [20], nitrogen dioxide [20], and nitrogen oxides [26]. In urban areas, UFP mainly originates from motor vehicle exhaust, PNC concentrations decrease exponentially with increasing distance from major roadways and reach background levels within about 200 m [37]. These previous findings on traffic-related air pollution are somewhat consistent with the null associations observed in our study.

However, there are some longitudinal studies showing that particulate air pollution is associated with cognitive decline [18–21]. Scrutinizing these findings may be useful to better understand the discrepancies between individual studies. In the Nurses’ Health Study [18], Weuve et al. found that coarse particulate matter (PM2.5–10) and PM2.5 were associated with faster decline in global cognition. The association was stronger for PM2.5–10 than PM2.5 in terms of effect sizes and linear exposure-response trends [18]. These findings are not consistent with the general consensus that PM2.5 is more strongly associated with chronic health outcomes than coarse particles [10].

In a longitudinal study including two cohorts in New York City [19], Kulick et al. found that in one cohort, residential PM2.5 was associated with cognitive decline in global function as well as memory, language, and executive function. However, when PM10 was used as the exposure, the associations were largely null (except for global cognition). Furthermore, these significant associations were not observed in another cohort with smaller sample size [19].

In the French Three-City Cohort Study [20], Duchesne et al. found that residential PM2.5 was associated with slightly faster decline in global cognition, but not with domain-specific cognition [20]. Recently, Younan et al. found that greater reduction in residential PM2.5 was associated with slower decline in global cognition and episodic memory among older women, and the associations remained stable after adjustment for covariates [21]. Although these previous studies suggest significant associations, it is notable that the findings are not consistent across the individual studies, and there is currently no sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between particulate air pollution and cognitive decline.

Our study has some strengths. First, we included a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, which quantitatively characterized annual changes in global and four domain-specific cognitive functions during the follow-up period. In addition, we used both standardized z scores and original scores as the outcome variables in the statistical analysis, and the results are consistent. Second, previous studies have used particle mass concentrations to assess exposure to particulate air pollution. To our knowledge, the current study is the first investigating the associations between UFP exposure and cognitive decline. Finally, the study participants were recruited by ADRCs across the US, making the findings broadly generalizable.

This study has some limitations to be considered. First, our UFP exposure was assessed using a nationwide LUR model rather than actual measurement, the LUR model was able to explain 77% of spatial variation in UFP [34]. In addition, because of privacy protections, only the first 3 digits of the residential ZIP codes were available to assign the exposure data. A 3-digit ZIP code may cover a large area, especially in rural and remote regions. The PNC levels at 3-digit ZIP code areas would miss near roadway scale elevation of UFP [37]. Second, our exposure assessment aimed to approximately reflect exposure levels outside the residences rather than actual personal exposure. Many factors such as air infiltration, individual mobility, and outdoor activity might affect actual personal UFP exposure [38]. It is possible that exposure assessment errors were nondifferential, which would lead to underestimation of the true associations [39,40]. Finally, higher levels of UFP may indicate higher levels of urbanization, which may in turn indicate potential better education, higher-level occupations, higher income, and improved access to social and health services. These protective factors may play a role in slowing the process of age-related cognitive decline. Our multivariable analysis may not be able to disentangle the influences of these factors. This limitation may partly explain the null association in our study if the association is truly existent.

5. Conclusions

In this 4-year longitudinal analysis, we found no meaningful associations between residential UFP exposure and cognitive decline in global and domain-specific functions. In addition, it is notable that the previous findings on the associations between particulate air pollution (e.g., black carbon, PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM10) and cognitive decline are mixed. Even among studies reporting significant associations, the findings are not consistent across the individual studies. Given the potential importance of ambient UFP with respect to cognitive decline, more research is needed to clarify the relationship using finer grain exposure assessment that captures near highway UFP gradients.

Highlights

APOE ε4 carriers had faster annual decline in every cognitive function.

Smoking was associated with faster decline in memory and executive function.

Higher income neighborhoods had greater exposure to ultrafine particles.

No meaningful association was found between ultrafine particles and cognitive decline.
