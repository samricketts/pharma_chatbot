Introduction:

Four years ago this Autumn, pioneering neurologist Prof. Allen. D. Roses passed away. Hence, we have taken time to reflect on his work and legacy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research. Prof. Roses rejected the widely accepted amyloid hypothesis, which identifies amyloid beta (Aβ) protein accumulation within the brain as the cause of AD. Instead, he proposed that the epsilon type 4 allele of apolipoprotein (APOE- Ɛ4) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) were preeminent factors in the pathogenesis and progression of AD, particularly in late-onset AD (LOAD). This rejection of the amyloid hypothesis has generated new investigations into APOE and TOMM40 as risk factors for AD.

Areas covered:

We discuss the contributions of Prof. Roses to AD research, describe how APOE-Ɛ4 and TOMM40 have been posited to trigger neuropathological changes leading to AD, and explore paths to future clinical applications built on the foundations of his research.

Expert opinion:

The unconventional methodology of targeting APOE and TOMM40 offers great potential for the development of effective preventive and disease-modifying AD interventions. Future preclinical and clinical investigations will greatly benefit from the groundbreaking scientific discoveries of Prof. Roses.

pmc1. Introduction

The passing of Prof. Allen Roses in October of 2016 has left behind a legacy of discovery and innovation in the field of medical research, particularly in the search for a fuller understanding of and effective therapeutics against Alzheimer’s disease (AD), for which the neuroscience community owes a debt of gratitude. Prof. Roses (1993) described apolipoprotein epsilon type 4 allele (APOE-ε4), a known genetic trait linked to heart disease located on chromosome 19q13.2, as a region associated with heritability of late-onset AD (LOAD) and noted that the presence of APOE-ε4 in this region appeared to associate with LOAD. Thus, the synthesis of these two factors, genetic and this allele within the chromosome coding for this gene, could predispose an individual to have an AD diagnosis with this particular biochemical pattern [1]. Prof. Roses later pointed out (2016) that Genome-Wide Association Screening (GWAS) for APOE-ε4 had successfully been applied for slightly longer than one decade following the publication of this previous manuscript, thereby further evincing the reliability of his argument in favor of a methodology targeting this genetic configuration [2]. Here, we will explore Prof. Roses’ most significant contributions to AD research: his rejection of amyloid theory and advocacy for considering APOE-ε4 and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) as the dominant genetic factors driving LOAD.

2. The APOE ε4 allele is involved in AD onset and pathology

Prof. Roses’ observation of the genetic influence on AD pathology has prompted a multitude of researchers to shift their focus accordingly. While senile plaques had previously been considered as the origin of AD, Prof. Roses instead viewed these neurological abnormalities as symptoms of the disease. The origin, therefore, must lie elsewhere, and Prof. Roses posited chromosome 19q13.2 as the locus. Presence of the APOE-ε4 allele increased risk of developing AD, whereas the APOE-ε2 allele decreased risk relative to the most-common APOE-ε3 allele. Yet it is important to keep in mind that the carrying of an APOE-ε4 allele does not necessarily lead to clinical AD, and neither is its presence sufficient to definitely diagnose AD. Therefore, additional, potentially interacting, genetic, and non-genetic factors must be involved in disease pathogenesis and progression. These originators and their interactions along the path toward AD have not yet been identified, and the search to identify all of the pieces that will fit together each component within the AD puzzle continues [3].

As the number of APOE-ε4 alleles increases, risk proportionately increases to 90%, and approximately 68 years of age is the mean age at onset. Individuals with at least one APOE-Ɛ4 allele face increasing risk of suffering AD by the age of 80 [4]. In a study of twins drawn from the Swedish Twin Registry investigating the genetic factor on twins where at least one counterpart was living with either All Dementia, AD Only, or Non-AD Dementia, female twins were identified as highest at risk of all forms of dementia, thus suggesting that both genetics and biological sex at birth are factors that must be considered together when tracing a chromosomal/genetic origin for AD [5]. Because no indication was given that any of the twins included in the study did not identify as the gender they were assigned at birth, perhaps future studies might consider gender identity, in addition to sex, and include participants who identify as transgender, non-binary, or other, lesser known and understood gender identities for a clearer insight into the interactions between genetics, biological sex, and gender. Given that lifetime risks (LTRs) for AD remain largely unknown and that by 85 years of age the LTR of AD for males is 11% and 14% for females [5], such a question might be worth considering.

As shown by Levi et al. (2003), learning and memory, combined with an environment leading to cognitive development, improves for individuals with the APOE-Ɛ3 allele [6]. However, no cognitive improvement occurs for individuals with APOE-Ɛ4, whose learning and memory remain equivalent to individuals with APOE-Ɛ3 in unenriched environments, when both sets of individuals have been exposed to the same enriched environment. Levels of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin and the polypeptide neural growth factor (NGF) were elevated in APOE-Ɛ3 individuals but not in APOE-Ɛ4 individuals. For both sets of individuals, an enriched environment increased levels of cortical synaptophysin and NGF. This study by Levi et al. indicates that APOE-Ɛ4 prevents neurogenesis within the hippocampus and restricts the beneficial influence of a stimuli-rich environment by inhibiting neural cell growth and thereby impeding learning and memory [7]. APOE-Ɛ2 and APOE-Ɛ3 can mitigate neurodegeneration by stimulating neurogenesis in enriched environments, while APOE-Ɛ4 can trigger apoptosis in similar environments [8]. The question of what constitutes an enhanced environment, in terms of human life, society, and disease pathology requires a global perspective that takes into account culture, biological sex, genetic background, and a broad spectrum of diverse ways and means by which humans interact with their world. We can touch on a few of them as we continue our discussion.

Makker et al. observed that APOE-Ɛ4 is associated with a more rapid general cognitive decline in women, it is associated with a more rapid memory decline in men, and homozygotes tend to experience both a more rapid decline in memory and other cognitive function than heterozygotes. Furthermore, older Asians experience a greater decline than Caucasians in memory, not taking sex into account. Although APOE-Ɛ4 relates to cognitive decline in both men and women, age and APOE-Ɛ4 homozygotes increase AD risk for both sexes, and women and individuals of Asian ethnicity carry a higher risk than Caucasian men [8]. Relative to Caucasian men, both Caribbean Hispanics and Mexican Americans also experience a higher prevalence of AD. AD risk increases significantly when individuals have family members with the disease, with an LTR close to 50%, suggesting that, for these individuals, risk increases proportionately with age. Genetic mutations in chromosomes 1, 14, and 21 associate with early-onset AD, and chromosomal influence from chromosomes 12 and 19 may also contribute additional risk factors, with the extent and mechanisms of influence not yet fully understood [9]. Furthermore, African American individuals have shown a lower frequency of APOE-Ɛ4 allele but a higher risk and prevalence of AD. This inverse relationship between APOE-Ɛ4 and AD complicates the notion that a lower APOE-Ɛ4 frequency results in a - decreased AD risk [10]. What remains unknown is the interplay between genetic factors, environment, and genetic and ethnic differences among diverse populations in determining an individual’s susceptibility for either early or late onset AD.

Understanding the molecular progression of AD and its attendant characteristics, most strikingly exemplified by extracellular amyloid β plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. APOE-Ɛ4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for LOAD, increasing the risk of AD by 3 ~ 4 times in heterozygotes and by ~12 times in homozygotes [11]. The APOE-Ɛ4 allele has been shown to reduce the clearance and increase the seeding of Aβ−42 [12]. Saunders et al. found that APOE-Ɛ4 frequency increases not only in late-onset familial and sporadic AD but also in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, and Down syndrome. This study found no differences between controls and subjects whose data was included in the database under investigation, further evincing APOE-Ɛ4 as a high-risk factor in LOAD [13].

A study by Liraz, Boehm-Cagan, and Michaelson (2013) showed that APOE-Ɛ4 accelerates the accumulation of Aβ42 and explained how the effects of APOE-Ɛ4 begin to manifest and can be detected even at young age, years before symptoms. However, the presynaptic glutamatergic vesicular transporter, VGlut, in the CA3, CA1, and DG hippocampal (HC) subfields were lower in HC neurons of APOE-Ɛ4 mice than these levels were in APOE-Ɛ3 mice. APOE-Ɛ4 had no effect on inhibitory GABAergic nerve terminals and perikarya [14]. Aβ metabolism associates with familial AD, a rare autosomal diseased marked by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin genes. In contrast, more than 15 million individuals throughout the world suffer from the more common form of AD, sporadic AD, a heterogeneous disease caused by an interaction between neural cellular degeneration during the aging process, genetic influences, and environment, yet the extent and proportionality to which these influences cause the disease remain unknown [11]. These findings appear to correlate with findings by Cacciaglia et al. which trace the mechanisms driving elevated risk for AD to dose-dependent elevated Aβ42 levels and APOE-Ɛ4 working in synchrony [15].

3. Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40), in particular TOMM40’523, shares influence on AD with APOE

Prior to the discovery of APOE-Ɛ4 in 1973, the foundation for Prof. Roses’ rejection of amyloid as the cause of AD, and support for a new theory which hypothesized that APOE-Ɛ4, in tandem with a secondary protein, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40), the neural plaques and tangles which characterize AD were thought to cause AD. He claimed that the true risk allele on chromosome 19q13 was not APOE-Ɛ4 itself, but the adjacent TOMM40 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial outer membrane protein. Discovering a variable length polyT region within an intron in TOMM40, Roses reported the longest variant to be associated with an earlier onset of AD and co-inherited with the APOE-Ɛ4 allele. In further work, he tied the longer TOMM40 alleles to brain atrophy and cognitive decline.

These two proteins have gained prominence in contemporary AD research as working in concert to alter neuronal structure and function, leading to the neurodegeneration seen in AD and other associated forms of dementia. 58–79% of risk for LOAD is due to genetic factors, and APOE-Ɛ4 has the strongest association with LOAD and disease onset at a younger age. Together, three genes, APOE, translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) and APOC1, have the strongest influence on LOAD [16]. A study by Zeitlow et al. found that over-expression of TOMM40 associates with a higher AD risk, but in elevated but non-excessive levels can protect the mitochondria which, in turn, preserve a degree of normal brain function [17]. The TOMM’523 variant, neighboring the APOE gene on chromosome 19 is of particular interest in AD research and in need of further investigation. A study by Yu et al. demonstrated that study participants with the S/S poly-T (TOMM40 S/S) genotype experienced faster cognitive decline and deficiencies in episodic and semantic memory [18]. Burggren et al [19]. explain that both the TOMM40 and APOE-Ɛ4 alleles tend to be mutually heritable and therefore inextricably linked. Perhaps, based on this finding, a fuller understanding of one requires a fuller understanding of the other. Returning to the question of how factors such as genetic background and ethnicity can shape AD genesis and progression, Caucasians and African Americans, in a study by Yu et al. [20] displayed different patterns of APOE-Ɛ4 and ‘523 poly-T alleles in TOMM40. African Americans had a lower prevalence of APOE-Ɛ4 yet higher incidence of AD. Both Caucasians and African Americans displayed remarkably low levels of TOMM40’523 L, possibly indicating the necessity of examining these two proteins together to analyze their influence on AD pathology [20]. Such a study could confirm Prof. Roses’ hypothesis that genetic factors must be factored into the search for AD therapeutics and could emphasize a greater focus on environmental conditions as well. Taken together, these proteins could constitute accurate biomarkers for AD [21]. In addition, HC volume is a strong indicator of the potential presence of AD, and a study of senior citizens living in assisting living facilities by Lyall et al. found no decrease in HC volume when investigating the independent effects of APOE-Ɛ4 and TOMM40’523, a discrepancy that calls for further in-depth analysis [22]. An earlier study of HC volume and genetic risk factors by Potkin et al. showed that carriers of the TOMM40’523 gene had a 200% higher risk when compared to non-TOMM40’523 controls [23]. HC atrophy rate, along with HC volume, appears to originate from the genes coding from APOE-Ɛ4 and TOMM’523. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs4420638 and rs56131196 in the APOC1 gene and rs157582 in the TOMM40 gene on chromosome 19 associate with HC atrophy rate, as demonstrated by Guo

et al. [24]. This finding connects with Prof. Roses’ focus on the genetic foundations for AD, particularly in the late stages, when physiological changes most profoundly manifest and morphological abnormalities are consistent with expectations for AD pathology. A 2019 MRI study by Malykhin et al. recruited 127 participants ranging from 18 to 85 years of age, all of whom were in good health, to investigate the interaction between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and APOE polymorphisms and HC subfields and the influence of these factors on episodic memory (EM). In younger participants, a one-way ANOVA test did not show an association between BDNF polymorphisms and HC volume. In older participants, HC volume and HC subregion volume was greater than seen in those without BDNF. However, HC subfields volume was approximately equivalent for both subsets. BDNF did not appear to affect performance on tasks measuring memory for either younger or older participants with APOE polymorphism. However, while participants with APOE-Ɛ3 and APOE-Ɛ4 showed no major difference in HC subfield size, APOE-Ɛ2 and APOE-Ɛ4 showed a significant difference [25]. This difference may be explained by the capacity of APOE-Ɛ2 to mitigate neurodegeneration in contrast to the elevated risk of AD and associated dementias presented by APOE-Ɛ4, further illustrating the genetic influence on these alleles and these alleles influence on the development and pathology of AD. Ferencz et al. examined the influence of TOMM40 SNPs on HC volume and EM in order to more clearly ascertain its effects on older adults without dementia. The results of this study did not find a causal connection between the APOE-Ɛ4 allele and HC volume and EM or between TOMM40 SNPs and EM performance. The authors acknowledge, however, the possibility that APOE and TOMM40 may display various effects depending on age. In other words, these alleles may display deleterious effects when a combination of advanced age and a genetic profile at elevated risk of AD occur, so that it cannot be conclusively determined that HC volume and EM are not beyond the influence of TOMM40 and APOE-Ɛ4 [26]. In addition to HC volumes, mitochondrial function is impacted in AD. Mitochondrial function is affected by AD family history (FH), defined as maternal or paternal LOAD onset between ages 65 to 80. Family history FH AD affects mitochondrial function, and may influence memory decline related to TOMM40’523 [27]. These physiological alterations in AD further stress the crucial nature of continuing to investigate genetic factors as AD research advances.

4. Clinical applications influenced by the lifelong work of prof roses

Neuronal changes that characterize AD can begin to occur years, or even decades, before onset of the disease. The association between APOE and Aβ has been well established and could assist in the creation of reliable biomarkers for AD risk analysis and diagnosis. A recent single-center, longitudinal observational study by DuBois et al. used neuroimaging to illustrate that presence of the APOE ε4 allele is directly correlated with Aβ deposition in individuals with preclinical AD [28]. As Yamazaki et al. also note that APOE-Ɛ4 consistently associates with greater Aβ deposition in older individuals without cognitive impairment, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with AD [29]. The presence of APOE-Ɛ4 is a reliable indicator for elevated AD risk, particularly that which arises from FH, and individuals can be alerted far in advance of onset of symptoms, thereby being given a chance to make the necessary arrangements for themselves, and, if applicable, their families. It must be noted that AD genetic screening can be both a scientifically and ethically complex topic, as APOE-Ɛ4 signals a risk of AD but does not guarantee with 100% accuracy that an individual is certain to face a future AD diagnosis and no cure is available. Individuals may experience undue stress and strain upon learning that they carry this allele. However, for some who choose to undergo screening, opportunities to participate in research studies and clinical trials may be a rewarding experience.

One such study is the TOMORROW study, which was designed to assess AD risk based on participants’ genetic profiles and investigate the safety and efficacy of therapeutics to delay onset of AD-related MCI. Information detailing subjects’ TOMM40 rs 10,524,523 genotype, APOE genotype, and age was collected, and based on their profiles, they received either a trial medication or a placebo. This study aimed to match subjects’ genetic profiles with therapeutics targeting the specific risk factors associated with those genes [30].

Another study that investigated APOE-Ɛ4, specifically individuals who carry two copies of this allele, is the Alzheimer’s Prevention Initiative (API) GENERATIONS study. Enrollment in the study can take place online, at API’s website, or through referral by a health-care provider. The study included three main components: tau PET imaging, remote genetic counseling, and expansion of the API’s registry [30]. Although the GENERATIONS study was halted due to safety concerns, it offered a great deal of insight into the future of BACE-1 inhibitors as potential AD prevention therapies in APOE-Ɛ4 carriers. Further investigation is needed to establish a safe and efficacious dose for the AD population [31].

Differential efficacy has been noted for APOE-Ɛ4 carriers vs non-carriers in response to cholinesterase inhibitors [32]. The presence or absence of APOE-Ɛ4 has been associated with differing rates of ARIA-E in bapineuzumab and aducanumab [33]. Tramiprosate, the active agent in ALZ-801, was evaluated in a Phase 3 study of Mild to Moderate AD that enrolled all APOE genotypes and did not show efficacy in the overall study population. Subgroup analyses showed clinical efficacy in the high-risk APOE-Ɛ4 carriers [34]. Additionally, De Beaumont et al. showed that carriers of the APOE-Ɛ4 and butyrylcholinesterase genes with amnestic mild cognitive impairment exhibited a greater donepezil drug response determined by a reduction in cholinergic activity [35].

An open-label, dose-ranging study was started in 2018 to evaluate gene therapy to treat patients who are APOE-Ɛ4 homozygotes with a clinical diagnosis of AD. The study will assess the safety and toxicity of intracisternal administration of AAVrh.10hAPOE2, serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer vector expressing the cDNA coding for human apolipoprotein Ɛ2 (APOE-Ɛ2), directly to the CNS/ CSF of APOE-Ɛ4 homozygotes with AD [36].

5. Conclusion

Observations made by Prof Roses that (i) the APOE-Ɛ4 allele associates with elevated risk of AD, and (ii) that individuals with two APOE-Ɛ4 alleles face an even greater risk of the disease, challenged the predominant theories that centered on Aß as a theoretical cause of AD. This shifted the focus toward the examination of the genetic basis of AD and other associated dementias. His discovery of the link between APOE-Ɛ4 and AD subsequently shaped neuroscientific research in AD, MCI, and other age-related diseases and disorders of the brain. Because of his contributions to the field, interest in proteins such as APOE and TOMM40 has burgeoned, opening new thought conduits involving genetics, heritability, and the biological and environmental factors that mediate genetic expression. Appeals by Prof. Roses for greater attention to the genetic components that drive AD genesis and pathology were timely with the Human Genome Project, merging scientific understanding about human biology and concepts regarding the brain and the mind. This new emphasis on the genes as modulators of AD progression also arose during the historical period in which the Internet became a chief means of communication, interaction and shared knowledge, enabling studies such as GENERATIONS, where participants could enroll and participate in remotely. His work has benefited medical practitioners and patients, by allowing the creation of a more personalized health-care profile for each patient with a genetic profile available and physicians to target their efforts toward the specific needs of each patient. In the future, because of Prof. Roses’ innovation and drive to go beyond the dominant medical paradigms of his time, a plethora of new methodologies and expansions of current methodologies based on his work may arise, including more individualized care designed to address the unique needs of each patient, more studies in which participants can enroll and even take part online, and therapeutic interventions tailored to patients’ personalized genetic profiles, to name a few possibilities opened up by his legacy. Prof. Roses will be remembered and honored as a dedicated, forward-thinking researchers and physician who endeavored, with monumental success, to go beyond the limitations of medical thought during his time and shape AD basic and applied research and clinical applications of today, and of tomorrow.

6. Expert opinion

By considering the relationship between genes, environment, and AD pathology, Prof. Roses built a methodological framework for investigating in greater depth the neurodegenerative processes leading to AD. Over the two decades following his rejection of amyloid theory in favor of a genetics-based perspective toward AD, and LOAD in particular, insight into the genetic mechanisms that guide neural function and that can herald neurological dysfunction and degeneration has expanded to show a clearer view of the infinitesimal components that converge to define the human brain as a whole.

Yet, as monumental a project as mapping genetic factors such as TOMM40’523 and APOE, with a specific focus on the risk levied against individuals with the APOE-Ɛ4 allele in comparison to individuals who do not carry this allele, genes are one part of a puzzle with many other interlocking pieces which, when assembled, illustrate any given individual’s likelihood of developing AD or other associated forms of dementia. More information remains necessary before an accurate picture of the interconnected facets contributing to a clinical AD diagnosis can be drawn. While a genetic profile is helpful in determining AD risk, additional factors, including living environment and lifestyle, socioeconomic status, sex, and race, also contribute to an individual’s risk of AD and must also be considered in the context of risk assessment.

The proportionate influence of genetics relative to these factors remains indeterminate and in need of further analysis. Prof. Roses’ work has enabled a plethora of clinical trials and ongoing research studies, such as the TOMORROW and GENERATIONS studies noted above, which allow individuals to participate with a lower commitment to on-site time with clinicians and researchers. Instead, the majority of time participants dedicate to these studies is spent online, by responding to questionnaires and engaging remotely with interactive projects. Future studies might follow a similar path, thereby allowing researchers to collect both genetic samples and data regarding participants’ lifestyles and demographics.

Modern technology certainly allows for the flexibility studies of this nature offers and can be leveraged to acquire more detailed information and a more accurate picture of each participant on both a microscopic and macroscopic level. Consequently, a treatment plan fully personalized for each individual can be designed and implemented according to their unique medical needs. Prof. Roses pointed toward these possibilities when he centered AD research on genetics as the dominant influence of disease genesis and pathology. As clinical understanding advances and therapeutics show greater promise for safety and efficacy, Prof. Roses’ contributions to the field must be remembered as foundational to unlocking the potential applications of genetics-based AD research and therapeutics.

Article highlights

Prof. Allen D. Roses challenged the prevalent hypotheses that identified senile plaques (caused by the accumulation of amyloid beta protein 42 [Aß42]) as the primary cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

When compared with carriers of APOE-ε2 or APOE-ε3, carriers of the APOE-ε4 allele face a significantly higher risk for developing late-onset AD (LOAD). This provides compelling evidence for more extensive investigations into the role of genetic background in AD pathology.

The contribution of APOE and TOMM40 to the physiological changes that lead to AD continues to be an area of scrutiny.

Clinical applications of the findings of Prof Roses include several clinical trials such as the GENERATIONS and TOMORROW studies.

•• This phase 3 double-blind, parallel-group study used TOMM40 rs 10524523 genotype,Apolipoprotein E genotype, and age to stratify individuals into high-risk and low-risk groups inorder to assess efficacy of a potential drug to delay onset of mild cognitive impairment due toAD. Prof. Roses’ previous work served as the foundation of this trial.
