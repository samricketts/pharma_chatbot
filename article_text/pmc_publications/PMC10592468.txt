Background:

Home health services are an important site of care following hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries, providing health assessments that can be leveraged to detect diagnoses that are not available in other data sources. In this work, we aimed to develop a parsimonious and accurate algorithm using home health outcome and assessment information set (OASIS) measures to identify Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD).

Methods:

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with a complete OASIS start of care assessment in 2014, 2016, 2018, or 2019 to determine how well the items from various versions could identify those with an ADRD diagnosis by the assessment date. The prediction model was developed iteratively, comparing the performance of different models in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of prediction, from a multivariable logistic regression model using clinically-relevant variables, to regression models with all available variables and predictive modeling techniques, to estimate the best performing parsimonious model.

Results:

The most important predictors of having a diagnosis of ADRD by the start of care OASIS assessment were a prior discharge diagnosis of ADRD among those admitted from an inpatient setting, and frequently exhibiting symptoms of confusion. Results from the parsimonious model were consistent across the four annual cohorts and OASIS versions with high specificity (above 96%), but poor sensitivity (below 58%). The positive predictive value was high, over 87% across study years.

Conclusions:

The proposed algorithm has high accuracy, requires a single OASIS assessment, is easy to implement without sophisticated statistical models, and can be used across four OASIS versions and in situations where claims are not available to identify individuals with a diagnosis of ADRD, including the growing population of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.

pmcIntroduction

The number of Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is increasing, with an estimated 6.2 million older adults living with Alzheimer’s dementia in 2022.1 Beyond prevention and pharmacological treatments, significant resources are being invested to improve their lives and better support their families. The development of pragmatic clinical trials using behavioral interventions, such as music to manage behavioral symptoms, or decision support tools to promote advance care planning is particularly promising.2,3 Pragmatic trials have the potential to demonstrate the impact of interventions directly among their target population. Pragmatism can be increased by relying on healthcare-generated data to identify persons living with dementia (PLWD) rather than relying on research staff to assess participants.4

Home health services are an important site of care following hospitalization among beneficiaries enrolled in traditional Medicare, with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reporting that 8.6% of beneficiaries used these services in 2019. Many have ADRD; over 43.9% were identified as having some cognitive impairment between 2011–2016,5 and dementia represents a known risk factor for home health visit intensity6 and potentially preventable hospital readmission among those receiving post-acute care in this setting.7 Focusing on home health recipients provides opportunities to develop care improvement interventions outside of institutionalized post-acute care settings like nursing homes.

There is substantial effort to leverage healthcare data to improve prediction of a diagnosis of dementia in various populations.8–12 These algorithms tend to be complex, requiring many data points and substantial computing power, making them harder to implement, with limited accuracy across varying populations. Comparing algorithms’ performance is challenging across populations with different levels of symptoms, especially when health organizations use unique data elements. In a systematic review, Kumar and colleagues examined 64 studies applying predictive modeling algorithms to clinical and electronic health records (EHR) data to predict the progression of ADRD, finding only seven with sample sizes over 100,000.13 Among US-based studies with large samples, a predictive modeling approach to identify incident ADRD (N=590,539) using medical and pharmacy claim data yielded a 50-variable model with an area under the curve (AUC) of 69.3, sensitivity of 9.9% and specificity of 98.6%.14 Another study using the same dataset employed case-control design matching, and yielded an AUC of 0.63 including 31 predictors.15 Comparing deep neural network models to traditional predictive modeling approaches improved detection, with an AUC of 94.4%, with 3–8 year prediction models resulting in AUCs 80–85%.16 Although deep neural network models performed better than traditional predictive modeling techniques, they require specialized hardware and expertise, and larger, multisource datasets to do so.16

Our research objective was to develop a simple and accurate algorithm using the home health Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) to identify a diagnosis of ADRD among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. This algorithm could be used to identify individuals with ADRD among all home health users.

Methods

Study Population and Data Sources

Our retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries aimed to determine how well items available in OASIS could identify those with an ADRD diagnosis. Using the annual Medicare Enrollment Summary Files (MBSF), we excluded beneficiaries without continuous fee-for service Medicare coverage during each study year and matched them to 100% OASIS assessment files, retaining beneficiaries with a start-of-care OASIS assessments in 2014, 2016, 2018, or 2019. Approximately 20% of the annual cohorts had more than one start-of-care assessment per year; for these, we selected one at random.

Reference Standard for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia

The reference standard of an ADRD diagnosis prior to the OASIS assessment date was based on the first ADRD diagnosis present in the 27 Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) chronic conditions dataset. The CCW definition generated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) detects diagnoses across Medicare administrative claims data.

OASIS Covariates and Versions

OASIS assessments are primarily completed by registered nurses and include many domains such as patient history and diagnoses, risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, risk factors for hospitalizations, living arrangements, sensory, respiratory and elimination status, neuro/emotional/behavioral status, ADL (Activities of Daily Living) and IADL (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living), medication/care management, and therapy needs. The OASIS instrument has changed significantly over time. Major changes between 2014 and 2019 included removing procedure codes and relying on the ICD-10 for diagnostic fields; adding active diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus, measurements of height and weight, and an ADL item for mobility from lying to sitting, and 25 fewer measures in OASIS D than previous versions with al section assessing functional ability and goals, laying groundwork for more standardized measures across post-acute care settings. Each set of assessments was thoroughly reviewed and coded to ensure all observations and available variables were retained in analyses despite numerous skip patterns.

Statistical Analyses

The predictive model was initially developed with data from OASIS Version C in 2014. First, we selected clinically important variables (e.g. having a discharge diagnosis of ADRD in the prior 14 days, level of cognitive impairment, memory issues as a prior condition, depressive symptoms, and confusion) based on prior literature to estimate a multivariable logistic regression model. We then identified additional variables that most improved the prediction accuracy by using all available OASIS variables in a logistic regression model and predictive modeling algorithms including LASSO regression,17 ridge regression,18 classification and regression trees (CART),19 and random forests.20 Our final, parsimonious model maintained important variables detected through these steps in a simple logistic regression model that can be applied without processing all available covariates or applying sophisticated predictive modeling algorithms. Variables retained in this final model rose to the top of predictive modeling algorithms and increased the area under the curve (AUC) of logistic regression models by 0.01 or more. Logistic regression models were developed in a training sample comprising a 75% random sample from 2014. Their performance was validated in the remaining 25% of the sample in 2014, and re-estimated in subsequent years to examine performance across different OASIS versions.

For each model, we generated predicted classifications (considering a probability equal/above 0.5 as having an ADRD diagnosis) to determine accuracy in the testing sample as shown by the specificity, sensitivity, and the positive predictive value (PPV, i.e., the proportion of beneficiaries correctly identified as having ADRD diagnosis by their first OASIS assessment). We carried out sensitivity analyses (see supplemental materials for further details), estimating our final model with recurring annual end-of-year diagnosis of ADRD as the reference standard, and stratifying these estimates by discharge origins prior to home health (inpatient stay, community, or nursing home), and by sex and race/ethnicity.

Results

Table 1 shows sociodemographic and OASIS characteristics across study years. The proportion of persons with a first diagnosis of ADRD recorded in the CCW prior to their OASIS assessment ranged from 30.1%−35.6% between 2014 and 2019. Supplementary Table S1 compares Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health services in 2014 to the overall Medicare population, showing the former were older and more likely to have an ADRD diagnosis. Among the predictive modeling algorithms employed (output not reported), the CART and Random Forest models yielded the highest overall AUCs, with the latter yielding a value of 87.3. Comparison of the variable importance plots generated from Random Forest to the variables deemed of importance from LASSO and ridge regression indicated a large degree of agreement with variables including age, discharge diagnosis of ADRD in the previous 14 days, cognitive function, frequency of confusion, and inability to take oral medication without supervision important across approaches. The final parsimonious models (see Table 2) contain the most important predictors of having an ADRD diagnosis, combining clinically important variables with predictive modeling algorithms. Figure 1 shows the confusion matrix and AUC obtained when estimating this parsimonious model with a predicted probability of ≥0.50 as indicative of ADRD in the 2014 testing sample and re-estimated across subsequent OASIS versions. Results were consistent across OASIS versions with high specificity (above 96%), but poor sensitivity (not exceeding 58%). The proportion of beneficiaries correctly identified as having the diagnosis was high (above 87%) across study years. Sensitivity analyses (see supplemental materials) show higher accuracy for prediction with a recurring diagnosis of ADRD as the reference standard (Table S2) and slight variation in accuracy by discharge origin (Table S3) and sex and race/ethnicity (Table S4). Over half (56.8%) of those with a false positive prediction in 2014 had an incident diagnosis of ADRD in 2015, compared to 9.6% with a negative prediction (data not shown).

Discussion

Our objective was to develop a simple OASIS-based algorithm with minimal data requirements to accurately identify Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of ADRD. The proposed parsimonious model was very specific, albeit with low sensitivity, with a PPV over 87%. The simplicity, stability over time despite changes to OASIS instruments, and availability to health systems providing home health services make it an appealing option to identify beneficiaries likely to have an ADRD diagnosis for enrollment in pragmatic trials of behavioral interventions or other targeted quality improvement measures,4 or in populations like Medicare Advantage beneficiaries where encounter claims are recently available to researchers but no claims-based ADRD diagnosis models currently exist.21 Although our original model identifying clinically-relevant indicators associated with dementia in other populations performed well, predictive modeling algorithms identified additional variables that improved accuracy, such as inability to take oral medication without supervision.

Many different algorithms have been proposed to predict ADRD diagnoses, but few leverage OASIS assessments specifically, varying in methodology, performance, complexity, and target population. Tradeoffs between accuracy and the complexity and span of data that they require should be considered based on the needs of each study or intervention. A study using clinical assessments from the Health and Retirement Study demonstrated that an algorithm with a one-year look back may improve the PPV among specific groups (e.g., members of racial and ethnic minority groups and those with advanced dementia), but has lower sensitivity for detecting mild disease.22 Racial and ethnic diversity23,24 and disease severity are known factors shaping the ability of algorithms to distinguish true positives.25 Enduring concerns about the lack of consistent information provided across studies make it challenging to compare predictive modeling algorithms to analyze EHR and administrative data between studies in geriatric mental health.26

The prediction of recognized dementia, operationalized as a CCW diagnosis of ADRD, has implications for the measurement of cognitive impairment across post-acute care settings and in home health specifically. Knox and colleagues developed a clinically-informed equivalence between the Functional Assessment Staging Tool as a method for staging individuals with dementia using various OASIS items, and showed a significant relationship between increased severity and the risk of potentially preventable hospital readmission.7 When looking at participants in the National Health and Aging Trends Study using home health, Burgdorf and colleagues found the prevalence of cognitive impairment ranged from 18.4% of the sample with probable dementia, as measured by NHATS, to 43.9% with some level of impaired cognitive function as documented in OASIS.5 The most appropriate measure depends on the specific research question and application. Efforts to standardize measures of cognitive function across post-acute care assessments are ongoing,27,28 and the adoption of the Brief Interview for Mental Status into the latest OASIS Version E in 2023, given its usability and high interrater agreement,29 is promising. Until this measure becomes widely available, and for any analyses using earlier data, our proposed algorithm fills a need to identify beneficiaries with a diagnosis of ADRD.

This work is not without limitations. We relied on a single reference standard of diagnosed ADRD captured in claims data as part of the CCW. Recent work has shown that this standard’s three-year look back period may no longer be necessary to address underdiagnosis, given improved documentation of ADRD diagnoses in administrative claims data.22 Future steps include testing the proposed algorithm among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries for whom there are encounter claims data available, examining its performance in predicting severity of cognitive impairment, and improving predictive validity by relying on repeated OASIS assessments over time for the same beneficiary.

In conclusion, our OASIS-based algorithm achieves high accuracy with a single OASIS assessment without requiring sophisticated statistical algorithms for implementation, and can be used across four OASIS versions and in situations where claims to identify individuals with a diagnosis of ADRD are unavailable.

Key Points:

Home health assessments represent an underutilized source of administrative data to identify persons living with dementia for a variety of purposes, including pragmatic trials and other population health surveillance and interventions.

Our research proposes a parsimonious and accurate algorithm utilizing measures from the home health outcome and assessment information set (OASIS) to identify Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD.

Why does this paper matter?

The algorithm we propose in this article is both accurate, correctly identifying over 87% of beneficiaries with ADRD, and parsimonious, not requiring modeling expertise or substantial computing power. These qualities make this algorithm highly relevant and beneficial for identifying those living with ADRD for pragmatic clinical trials, reporting, and interventional purposes.
