The basal forebrain contains a phenotypically-diverse assembly of neurons, including those using acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter. This basal forebrain cholinergic system projects to the entire neocortical mantle as well as subcortical limbic structures that include the hippocampus and amygdala. Basal forebrain pathology, including cholinergic dysfunction, is thought to underlie the cognitive impairments associated with several age-related neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease. Basal forebrain dysfunction may stem, in part, from a failure of normal afferent regulation of cholinergic and other neurons in this area. However, little is understood regarding how aging, alone, affects the functional regulation of basal forebrain afferents in the context of motivated behavior. Here, we used neuronal tract-tracing combined with motivationally salient stimuli in an aged rodent model to examine how aging alters activity in basal forebrain inputs arising from several cortical, limbic and brainstem structures. Young rats showed greater stimulus-associated activation of basal forebrain inputs arising from prelimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area compared with aged rats. Aged rats also showed increased latency to respond to palatable food presentation compared to young animals. Changes in activation of intrinsic basal forebrain cell populations or afferents were also observed as a function of age or experimental condition. These data further demonstrate that age-related changes in basal forebrain activation and related behavioral and cognitive functions reflect a failure of afferent regulation of this important brain region.

pmc1. Introduction

The basal forebrain (BF) gives rise to ascending projections involved in cognitive functions including attention, wakefulness, arousal, and motivational salience[1]. The BF is neurochemically and anatomically heterogeneous but includes a functionally-prominent group of cholinergic neurons distributed among several contiguous nuclei including the substantia innominata, ventral pallidum, nucleus basalis, medial septum and diagonal band of Broca [2]. Collectively known as the basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS), these neurons are the principle source of acetylcholine (ACh) in the neocortical mantle and subcortical limbic structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala[3,4]. Behavioral manipulations or attentional tasks motivated by physiological drives suggests the BFCS is a crucial component of the neural substrates by which interoceptive states modulate salience attribution to exteroceptive cues [5–8]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that BFCS neurons in aged animals are less responsive to cues with physiological and motivational salience [9,10] or to homeostasis-related growth factors such as IGF-1 [11], deficiencies with potential relevance to age-related cognitive decline.

The BFCS is regulated by diverse afferents as revealed by traditional tracing approaches [12–14]. Pharmacological and optogenetic approaches have further revealed the neurotransmitters and circuits that mediate afferent control of BF forebrain function [7,15]. However, the specific sources of afferent signals that mediate cholinergic or non-cholinergic BF activation in response to motivated physiological states, and how these interactions are altered with aging, is not fully understood.

Here, we compared activation of BF afferents in response to food-paired cues in young and aged rats, with a focus on components of circuits underlying motivated behavior, attention and emotional processing.

2. Methods

2.1. Animals and entrainment

Young (2–3 month) and aged (26–28 month) male F344/Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats (National Institute of Aging Colony, Baltimore, MD, USA) were initially pair-housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00 h) with standard laboratory chow and water freely available. All animal experimental protocols accorded with the guidelines of the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of South Carolina. Every effort was made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.

Animals were handled daily during the first week after arrival. During the second week each animal underwent surgery for injection of cholera toxin B (CTb) into the basal forebrain (see below). After recovery from surgery, animals were individually housed for measurement of food intake under ad libitum conditions. One week post-surgery, animals were placed on a restricted diet consisting of 80 % of their ad libitum intake while receiving daily habituation to the testing chambers (parabolic clear plastic bowls; Bioanalytical Systems, Inc., West Lafayette, IN, USA).

Rats were divided into three experimental conditions. An experimental group (E1; n = 6 young + 9 old) received daily pairings of sudden darkness with palatable food reward (“bacon softie”; Bioserve, Fleming, NJ). After seven consecutive days of training, the latency of young animals to consume the palatable treat was generally less than five seconds (Fig. 1). E1 animals received a final presentation of the paired stimulus on the last entrainment day, two hours prior to euthanasia. A control group (C1; n = 8 young + 6 old), received identical training to the E1 group, but did not receive the paired food stimulus on the final test day prior to euthanasia. A second control group (C2; n = 5 young + 6 old) was food-restricted and handled similarly to the E1 and C1 groups, but never received the paired food stimulus.

2.2. Surgery

Under isoflurane anesthesia, 1.0 μl of a 1 % solution of the retrograde neuronal tract tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTb; Lot #10331A1; List Biological Laboratories, Inc., Campbell, CA) was unilaterally deposited into the basal forebrain (n = 6–8/group) using the following stereotaxic coordinates, relative to Bregma [16]: anterior (AP) −0.8 mm, lateral (L) +/− 2.5 mm, ventral (DV) −8.0 mm (from skull surface). Left and right hemispheres were equally represented. CTb was pressure injected over a 10 min interval (0.1 μl/min) and the needle remained in place for an additional 10 min post-infusion to allow diffusion away from the needle tract. Animals whose CTb deposits were not centered in the VP/SI, based on post-mortem immunohistological labeling, were excluded from analysis. Prophylactic buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg, s.c.; Med-Vet International, Mettawa, IL) was given at the conclusion of surgery to minimize post-operative pain during emergence from anesthesia. Animals were allowed one week recovery from surgery, while handling, habituation, and food intake measurement continued.

2.3. Euthanasia and immunohistochemistry

Two hours after the final presentation of the paired stimulus animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized via transcardial perfusion. After post-fixation and cryoprotection, brains were coronally sectioned (44 um) on a freezing microtome. All tissue for immunohistochemical analysis was processed according to previously described protocols with minor modifications [17,18]. Representative sections through the rostrocaudal extent of the brain were first mounted and stained for CTb to verify retrograde tracer deposit placement. Free-floating sections were incubated in goat anti-CTb antibody (1:7500; List Biological Laboratories) for 48 hr at 4 °C followed by biotinylated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1.5 hr at room temperature, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1600; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) for 1 hr at room temperature. Staining was visualized by addition of 3 % hydrogen peroxide to sections incubating in diaminobenzidine, yielding brown CTb-immunopositive labeling.

2.3.1. Double-label immunohistochemistry

Examination of activation of basal forebrain afferents focused primarily on those inputs originating from rostral limbic cortex (prelimbic, infralimbic and agranular insular cortices), extended amygdala (central amygdala and claustrum), and mesolimbic/diencephalic regions important for feeding (ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and lateral hypothalamus). While a comprehensive examination of all sources of basal forebrain afferents was beyond the scope of this study, the above nuclei represent a broad sampling of brain regions known to provide significant inputs to the BF related to cognition and motivated behavior.

To examine activation of BF afferents, representative sections from these regions were initially processed for immunolabeling of the neuronal activation marker, c-Fos by incubating in rabbit anti-c-Fos primary antisera (1:5000; Millipore Corp.,Temecula, CA; Cat.# ABE457; Lot#3041795) followed by biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:1600; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Development in a nickel/cobalt-enhanced diaminobenzidine solution resulted in blue-black immunolabeling confined to the nuclei of c-Fos-expressing neurons.

To demonstrate the anatomical or phenotypic source of basal forebrain afferents activated by the food-paired stimulus, c-Fos immunohistochemistry was followed by incubation in either goat α-CTb (see above), goat α-ChAT (1:3000; Millipore; Lot# 2762374, Cat#AB144), mouse α-parvalbumin (PV; 1:3000; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO; Cat#P3088, Batch# 016MA847V), or mouse α-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:3000; Immunostar, Hudson, WI; Lot# 907001; Cat.#22941) to identify activated basal forebrain afferents, cholinergic neurons, PV-positive GABAergic neurons, or dopaminergic neurons, respectively. Incubation in the second primary antibody was followed by the appropriate unlabeled secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and then peroxidase anti-peroxidase tertiary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Tissue was developed in plain diaminobenzidine solution, generating a brown cytoplasmic immunoprecipitate in CTb-, ChAT-, PV-, or TH-positive neurons. After dehydration and coverslipping, tissue sections were examined by light microscopy. For basal forebrain, two serial sections corresponding to the VP/SI component of this brain region (identified in reference to [16]) per animal, separated by approximately 200 um, were analyzed. All immunopositive neurons within the defined region were counted on each section. Tissue labeling was visualized using a Nikon E600 microscope with ‘CoolSNAP’ digital camera (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). Photomicrographs captured using IP Lab Software (Scanalytics; Trenton, NJ) were imported into Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems; San Jose, CA) where minor adjustments for brightness and contrast were made.

3. Statistical analysis

Latency (seconds) to feed was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Activation data for basal forebrain afferents (CTb + Fos) or phenotypically-characterized neuronal populations (Fos + ChAT/PV/TH) were summed for each region in each animal and expressed as percent double-labeled (number of double-labeled neurons divided by the number of phenotypically- or retrogradely labeled neurons within the region of interest). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with age and treatment condition as between-subjects variables. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.02 (GraphPad Software Inc.; San Diego, CA). Semi-quantitative assessment of single-labeled Fos + neurons in selected brain regions was based on cell counts within a defined area using a 0.49 mm2 reticle superimposed over the region of interest in two sections per animal. These data were binned according to Fos + cell density and expressed as absent (0), minimal (+, &lt;40 cells/mm2), moderate (++, 40–100 cells/mm2) and dense (+++, &gt;100 cells/mm2). See Table 1.

4. Results

4.1. Aged rats show increase in feeding latency

Old rats were slower to respond to the food-paired stimulus compared to their younger counterparts (F1,14 = 130.6; P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 1), consistent with our previous findings [9]. This difference became significant on entrainment day 3 and persisted across the 7-day training cycle (Fig. 1; day 1).

4.2. Ctb deposit sites

Basal forebrain CTb infusion produced labeling in and around the substantia innominata with some spread into adjacent nuclei such as the ventral pallidum (VP), medial septum(MS), or globus pallidus (Fig. 2B). Afferents labeled by BF CTb injection were found in medium- to high-density in cortical areas that included subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex, limbic structures that included the nucleus accumbens and central amygdala, claustrum, the lateral hypothalamus and ventral tegmental area (Fig. 2C). Aged and young rats showed qualitatively and quantitatively similar patterns of CTb labeling.

4.3. Phenotypic description of basal forebrain activation

The basal forebrain contains cholinergic, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons that may play different roles in attention and motivated behavior [19–23]. We found a significant age-related difference in activation of PV + GABAergic neurons in the BF following the food-paired stimulus, with aged rats showing significantly fewer activated neurons (p &lt; 0.05; Fig. 3A). There were no age-related differences in activation of PV + neurons in either control condition (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we did not observe any effect of the food-paired stimulus on activation of BF cholinergic neurons in either young or aged rats, nor did young and aged animals differ from each other on this measure (Fig. 3D). Similarly, in glutamatergic (vGluT1 + ) BF neurons, the food-paired stimulus did not significantly increase the percentage of neurons positive for c-Fos relative to either control group (all P’s &gt; 0.05), nor were there any age-related differences in activation of this neuronal population (Fig. 3G).

4.4. Activation of basal forebrain afferents originating from cerebral cortex

Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons project widely throughout the cerebral cortex but reciprocal cortico-basalis inputs originate preferentially from limited areas that include the PFC and (primarily agranular) insular cortex [14,22]. Thus, we examined the potential for age-related changes in activation of these afferents in our food-paired stimulus paradigm. Moderate-to-dense retrograde labeling of BF afferents was observed in prelimbic and infralimbic divisions of the medial PFC, with CTb + cells most abundant in deep (primarily layer V) layers (Fig. 4B-C, E-F,H-I). These neurons primarily exhibited a pyramidal morphology with prominent apical dendrites, consistent with the source of most prefrontal projections to subcortical regions, including the BF. Interestingly, young E1 rats showed significant increases in activation of basal forebrain afferents originating from the prelimbic cortex, but decreased activation of infralimbic inputs to basal forebrain (Fig. 4A-F). Aged rats failed to show activation of prelimbic inputs to basal forebrain relative to age-matched control groups (F2,33 = 12.1; p &lt; 0.05; Fig. 4A), leading to a significant difference between aged and young E1 animals. Like their young counterparts, aged rats showed a significant decrease in c-Fos expression in basal forebrain inputs originating from infralimbic areas (Fig. 4D).

Although robust retrograde labeling was seen in the insular cortex, there was no effect of experimental condition or age on activation of these BF afferents (Fig. 4G). Similarly, numerous retrogradely-labeled neurons were observed in the claustrum but there was no increase in activation of these afferents by the food-paired stimulus in either young or aged rats (F2,33 = 2.812; P &gt; 0.05; Fig. 5A).

4.5. Central amygdala

The central amygdala was the only brain region where we saw a significant difference between the two control groups, with young C2 animals (rats repeatedly exposed to the food-paired stimulus during entrainment, but not on the test day) showing significantly less c-Fos expression in basal forebrain projections compared to young C1 animals (F2, 33 = 4.183; P = 0.0240; Fig. 5D). This effect was not observed in aged rats.

4.6. Activation of basal forebrain afferents from components of motivated behavior circuits

Basal forebrain afferents originating from the lateral hypothalamus, which encompasses the classical “feeding center” as well as neuronal groups involved in regulation of wakefulness and other behaviors, were not activated by the food-paired stimulus in either young or aged rats (Fig. 6A). Both young and aged E1 rats showed activation, relative to age-matched controls, of basal forebrain afferents from the nucleus accumbens (F2,33 = 10.16; P &lt; 0.01; Fig. 6D). However, the magnitude of this increase was smaller in aged rats, leading to a significant effect of age within the E1 condition. Similarly, ventral tegmental area projections to basal forebrain were significantly activated in young, but not old, E1 rats (Fig. 6G).

Because VTA dopamine neurons are important for motivated behavior, we performed separate analysis of the percentage of TH-positive (putatively dopaminergic) neurons expressing c-Fos in the different ages and experimental conditions. Although Tukey’s post-hoc comparison revealed a trend for age-related differences in activation of dopamine neurons in the E1 condition, this did not reach significance (p = 0.08; Fig. 7).

4.7. Neuronal activation outside of basal forebrain afferents

A brain-wide assessment of age-related differences in neuronal activation associated with the different experimental conditions was beyond the scope of our work. However, as a general indicator of neuronal activity induced by the food-paired stimulus, we qualitatively assessed single-label c-Fos expression (i.e., c-Fos labeling outside of retrogradely-labeled basal forebrain afferents) in several brain regions from all three treatment conditions in both young and old rats. The highest levels of neuronal activation were observed in the prelimbic cortex, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area of animals in the E1 condition. Young and aged animals showed generally similar patterns of cFos expression, although aged rats showed qualitatively mild reductions in the aforementioned brain regions (Table 1).

5. Discussion

We used functional anatomical methods to examine how aging may alter afferent regulation of the basal forebrain in a rat model. Consistent with previous reports, we showed that aged, food-restricted rats are slower to respond to a food-paired stimulus than their young counterparts[9]. We have previously shown that manipulations that attenuate the cholinergic response to a food-paired stimulus in young animals also increase behavioral latency to approach and consume the food, whereas manipulations that enhance cholinergic signaling in aged or otherwise ACh-deficient animals decrease this behavioral latency[9,23,24]. While not a cognitive task, per se, a reasonable interpretation of these findings is that cholinergic signaling mediates, in part, the attentional component of motivated behavior. Thus, we further examined how basal forebrain afferents may be differentially activated in this paradigm in young and aged rats. Our findings demonstrate an age-related deficit in activation of basal afferents originating from prefrontal cortical and mesolimbic regions.

Intrabasalis deposits of CTb produced patterns of afferent cell labeling consistent with known sources of projections to basal forebrain [12,14,25,26]. We targeted the anterior portion of the basal forebrain, including the VP/SI, as this is the source of most reciprocal connections with anterior cortical and limbic structures [14]. In anterior cortex, for example, we observed robust labeling in prefrontal and insular areas—known sources of basal forebrain afferents[12,22]—but little or no labeling in somato-motor regions. While some reports suggest impaired retrograde transport in aged rodents, many of these focus on transport of neurotrophic substances within cholinergic neurons themselves [27–31] rather than transport of basal forebrain-projecting neurons. Thus, we saw qualitatively and quantitatively similar patterns of retrograde labeling in young and aged rats.

Some reports show modest loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons purely as a function of aging in rodent models, while others show no significant change [30–36]. However, abundant evidence suggests deficits in responsiveness of these neurons to stimuli relevant to homeostatic drives [32,37–39]. Using a similar food-paired stimulus, we have previously shown that aged rats show increased response latencies and attenuated ACh release elicited by the stimulus[9].

Interestingly, in prefrontal cortex we observed opposite responses of prelimbic and infralimbic activation (Fig. 4). These two regions play different, often opposing, roles in other behavioral paradigms including those involving fear learning [38]. In our young animals the stimulus elicited an increase in activation of prelimbic inputs to basal forebrain but a reduction in activation of infralimbic inputs (Fig. 4), perhaps consistent with promotion of appetitive motivated behavior. Thus, the limited activation of prelimbic inputs in our aged animals—with preserved reductions in infralimbic activation—may result in net failure to engage basal forebrain attentional circuits that mediate important cognitive aspects of motivated behavior. Functionally, this may contribute to the increased behavioral response latencies to the food-paired stimulus in the aged E1 rats.

Non-cholinergic basal forebrain neurons may also promote appropriate behavioral and cognitive responses to homeostatically-relevant environmental stimuli[39]. Parvalbumin (PV) is a calcium-binding protein which, in the basal forebrain, labels the majority of corticopetal GABAergic projection neurons PFC [20]. Our food-paired stimulus increased c-Fos expression in these PV-positive neurons in young, but not aged rats. Optogenetic studies demonstrate that PV-positive, cortically-projecting basal forebrain neurons promote cortical gamma band oscillations and default mode network-associated behaviors [40,41] whereas glutamatergic neurons of the basal forebrain may mediate arousal and avoidance-related behaviors [42]. Interestingly, aging and Alzheimer’s disease have been associated with decreased gamma rhythms in both humans and rodent models [43,44]. In addition, reduced activation of basal forebrain PV-positive neurons that project to cortex may reflect age-related loss of hypothalamic (specifically, orexin/hypocretin) inputs to basal forebrain, as we have previously shown [9,45].

Basal forebrain afferents from the amygdalar complex originate primarily from the central nucleus [46]. Electrophysiological studies suggest that the firing rate of central amygdala neurons is diminished when an expected reward is omitted [47]. Consistent with this idea, our young C2 rats (for which the food-paired stimulus was omitted on the final testing day) showed reduced c-Fos expression, relative to C1 rats (which never received the food-paired stimulus) in central amygdala neurons that project to basal forebrain. Thus, these inputs may relay information related to reward expectancy versus outcome to the basal forebrain. Importantly, we did not observe these differences in activation of central amygdala projections to basal forebrain in aged rats, suggesting that old animals may be less sensitive to mismatches between reward expectancy and outcome.

Finally, given the role of the mesocorticolimbic DA system in motivated behavior, we performed a first-pass general assessment of age-related differences in activation of these neurons in our paradigm. We saw a strong trend for aged animals to show reduced activation of dopaminergic VTA neurons in the E1 condition relative to their young counterparts. DA neurons in aged rodents are less responsive to reward cues than those from young animals[48], consistent our trend. Further studies examining projection-specific patterns of activated DA neurons will be necessary to determine how deficits in DA signaling contribute to altered behavioral response to food-paired stimuli that we observed in our aged rats.

In conclusion, aged rats are less responsive to a rewarding food-paired stimulus than their young counterparts and show altered patterns of activation in components of limbic and cognitive circuits that project to the basal forebrain. Diminished responsiveness to indicators of physiological homeostasis is a phenomenon that often precedes and predicts age-related cognitive decline in humans. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these deficits may lead to novel targets for intervention.
