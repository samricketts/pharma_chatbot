Introduction

We examined differences in the timeliness of the initiation of home health care by race and the quality of home health agencies (HHA) among patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).

Methods

Medicare claims and home health assessment data were used for the study cohort: individuals aged ≥65 years with ADRD, and discharged from the hospital. Home health latency was defined as patients receiving home health care after 2 days following hospital discharge.

Results

Of 251,887 patients with ADRD, 57% received home health within 2 days following hospital discharge. Black patients were significantly more likely to experience home health latency (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11–1.19) compared to White patients. Home health latency was significantly higher for Black patients in low-rating HHA (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.22–1.37) compared to White patients in high-rating HHA.

Discussion

Black patients are more likely to experience a delay in home health care initiation than White patients.

pmc1 BACKGROUND

There are about 6.5 million adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the United States.1 People with ADRD have significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality, emergency department use, hospitalization, and prolonged stays during inpatient hospitalizations compared to non-ADRD individuals.2 ADRD leads to more frequent hospitalizations due to a combination of comorbid conditions and the onset of (new) acute events, such as falls and infections.2–7 Hospitalizations for those with ADRD results in hospital-associated physical deconditioning, higher morbidity, and increased risk of mortality.8, 9

The post-hospitalization care transition to home is an especially vulnerable period for individuals with ADRD.10 If adequate, appropriate, and timely post-acute care (PAC) is not provided, the risk of unwarranted outcomes (e.g., re-hospitalization) increases.11 After acute hospitalization, PAC may mitigate the risk of negative outcomes, restore functional status, and improve quality of life. PAC can be provided in both institutional settings (e.g., skilled nursing facilities), and in homes, including home health services (HH). HH are coordinated by certified home health agencies (HHA) to provide medical, nursing, occupational and physical therapy, social work, and other services for an extended period.

For individuals with ADRD, there are several advantages of receiving HH. First, care is provided in the patient’s home, which may be less expensive than facility-based care and allows patients to remain in a familiar environment and in the community. Also, home-based settings reduce the risk of facility-acquired infections in these high-risk older adults, which is particularly important in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.12–14

The timely initiation of HH after hospital discharge has many benefits, such as reducing the risk of 30-day hospital readmission.15–17 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) define “timely” as initiation of HH within 48 hours of the referral or discharge (from the previous care) date.18 This has been developed into a quality measure—“How often the home health team began their patients’ care in a timely manner”—for HHA as part of the CMS Quality Reporting Program (QRP).19 Despite these benefits, previous studies reported &gt; 30% of their study population receiving HH services outside of the 2-day time period.15, 20 Other reports suggest that these rates are even lower for minority populations, individuals dually enrolled under Medicare and Medicaid, and those living in rural areas and impoverished neighborhoods.15, 16, 20–23

Some recent evidence has shown high HH use by individuals with ADRD, although this use varies by demographics.12 In rural areas, where there is limited availability of skilled nursing facilities and inpatient rehabilitation facilities,24, 25 HH is vital for providing multidisciplinary home-based nursing and rehabilitation care. Therefore, the timeliness of initiating HH is even more critical for those living in rural areas, after acute hospitalization,26–30 and for individuals with ADRD.31 While the initial evidence suggests that minority populations receive HH from lower-quality HHA,21, 32–34 the cumulative impact for racial and ethnicity minorities with ADRD and those referred to lower rated HH agencies on timely initiation of HH after acute hospitalization is unknown.

As the role of HH continues to grow, it is crucial to examine differences in timely coordination of care and identify modifiable factors to improve timely delivery of home-based clinical care and health outcomes for individuals with ADRD. This study aimed to investigate differences in the timing of initiating HH following hospitalization for older patients with ADRD by race/ethnicity and home health star ratings. In patients with ADRD receiving HH, we hypothesize that there will be a delay in starting HH care for racial and ethnic minorities receiving care from a poorly rated HHA.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design and ethics

This is a retrospective cohort study that used secondary data analysis (2016–2017). We obtained institutional review board approval and established a data use agreement with the CMS before conducting this study.

2.2 Study sample population

The study included patients with ADRD admitted to HH after discharge from an acute hospitalization between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2017. The study cohort included Medicare fee-for-service patients diagnosed with ADRD, aged 66–100, and went directly to home after hospitalization. From hospital claims and Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), patients were excluded if they (1) died during the index hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge from the hospital, (2) left against medical advice, (3) had a missing length of stay during acute hospitalization, (4) were transferred to another acute care hospital, or (5) were enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans (we did not have complete data for these patients). In addition, patients were excluded if they did not directly go to HH after hospital discharge or had a hospital stay or interruption during their HH episode. Patients were followed for 14 days after hospital discharge and were included in the study if they were discharged to HH to begin a new episode of care. Other exclusions are detailed in the cohort exclusion chart in Figure 1.

2.3 Data source

The Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) file was used to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with ADRD. We used Medicare inpatient claims data in a standard analytical file (SAF) format for 2016–2017 to identify acute hospital episodes for beneficiaries with ADRD before being discharged to HH. These files were linked with MBSF to obtain patient demographics (age, sex, race, enrollment in Medicaid, dual eligibility, and patient zip code). Finally, SAF files were linked to the PAC assessment file: Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS, version C1ICD10 and C2) for HH, SAF files for HH claims, and revenue center file for HH. OASIS is a federally required standardized assessment tool for HH patients. Information on functional status, pain, respiratory, and living status were obtained from the OASIS file. From the revenue center file, revenue center codes were used to identify the type of service provided during HH.

The Provider of Services file was used to retrieve HHA characteristics, such as profit status and whether the HHA is part of a larger chain. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database was used to obtain information on social determinants of health variables in the zip code of the HHA, defined by proportion of population in poverty. In addition, Medicare data were linked with the 2018 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data to obtain information on the concentration of nurse practitioners and physicians in the zip code of the HHA.

2.4 Variables

2.4.1 Primary outcome

The primary outcome of interest was latency in initiating HH after acute hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD, defined as receiving care &gt; 2 days after hospital discharge. We used Start of Care date from OASIS to identify initiation of HH services. We examined distribution of HH latency using latency as a continuous variable (with 14 days as the upper limit). We created a binary outcome: patients received care within 2 days of hospital discharge or more than 2 days after discharge.

2.4.2 Explanatory variable

We used publicly reported star ratings published on the CMS Care Compare website. The HHA star ratings use risk-adjusted outcome measures and process-of-care measures. Ratings range from 1 star (lowest quality) to 5 stars. We classified HHAs into two quality categories: low (≤ 4 stars) and high (&gt; 4 stars). From the MBSF file, race/ethnicity was categorized into non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, or Other (Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, or unknown), using Research Triangle Institute (RTI) International race variable. While previous evidence suggests higher sensitivity and specificity with self-reported race/ethnicity variable that is available in OASIS, we opted for RTI International race variable,35, 36 as our start point was acute hospitalization. We created six mutually exclusive groups to quantify the contribution by race and HHA star ratings: White patients + low HHA rating, White patients + high HHA rating, Black patients + low HHA rating, Black patients + high HHA rating, Hispanic patients + low HHA rating, and Hispanic patients + high HHA rating. We created these mutually exclusive groups to: (1) better interpret the data, (2) understand the cumulative effect of star ratings, and (3) test interactions in the analytical model (e.g., race/ethnicity and star ratings).

2.5 Statistical analyses

We used descriptive statistical procedures to analyze the association of covariates with latency in initiating HH. We reported continuous variables with means ± standard deviations and categorical variables with percentages. Bivariate analysis was used to examine the association between HH latency and patient-, institution-, and community-level characteristics. Factors that differed at a 5% level were incorporated into a multilevel, multivariate, logistic-regression model to examine the relationship between race/ethnicity and HH latency, adjusted for other covariates. Bivariate analyses are reported in Table 1. Factors with P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all analyses. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results from the two regression models are reported in Table 2. All analyses were done using SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc.).

3 RESULTS

Our sample identified 262,525 Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD receiving HH. We examined distribution of HH latency, using HH latency as a continuous variable. Approximately 57% received HH within 2 days following acute hospital discharge, 22% between 3and 7 days, 8% between 8 and 10 days, and 13% between 11 and 14 days. Patients with ADRD with higher HH latency (&gt; 2 days) were more likely to be female, Black, living in a rural setting, and provided services by a lower quality rating HHA (Table 1 and Figure 2). Other characteristics associated with HH latency were complications during hospital stays, intensive care unit admission, higher pain levels, and living alone. Patients admitted to for-profit HHA and not part of a chain also were associated with HH latency. Finally, community-level characteristics, such as the concentration of HHA, poverty status, and physician/nurse practitioner concentration, were associated with HH latency (Table 1). Differences in patient-, institution-, and community-level characteristics are presented in Table S1 in supporting information.

Table 2 presents the results from two multivariate multilevel logistic regression models with HH latency. Model 1 shows the main effect of race and HHA rating on HH latency. There is a significant association between Black patients with HH latency relative to White patients, adjusting for all the other covariates (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.11–1.19). Compared to patients treated by high-rating HHA, there was a significant association between low-rating HHA and HH latency (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02–1.11). We calculated the likelihood of HH latency using the mutually exclusive groups mentioned previously, using White patients in high-rating HHA as a reference group and adjusting for all the covariates (Model 2). Relative to White patients treated by high-rating HHA, the likelihood of HH latency was significantly higher for Black patients treated by low-rating HHA (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.22–1.37) as well as Black patients treated by high-rating HHA (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.05–1.13).

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we examined the association between HH latency with race and HHA quality ratings for Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. Our evidence reveals racial disparities in the initiation of HH services by both low- and high-rated HHAs. Even when we adjusted by clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, Black patients with ADRD experience higher HH latency. Among Black patients treated in low-rated HH agencies, the likelihood of HH latency was the highest.

Given that the gap in HH latency was wider among low-quality agencies, it is critical to improve access to high-quality HH among racial and ethnic groups. While we cannot determine whether these differences are related to HH practices, logistical barriers, or patient preferences, it is unlikely that patient preferences fully explain the observed gaps. Disparities in HH latency may be driven by systemic and structural racism that continues to perpetuate unfair access to timely and high-quality care for Black populations.37 For example, there is a lack of equitable access to high-quality HHA for older Black patients and limited availability of HHAs in areas with high concentrations of minority populations.33 Moreover, members of racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely to reside in areas with limited resources and lower socioeconomic status, and have health professional shortages, including shortages of physicians, nurses, and rehabilitation providers.38 A first step in addressing these disparities would be to improve access to high-quality HHAs and timely access to care among racial and ethnic minorities with ADRD.

Our results have policy implications. First, the timely initiation of HH is an important quality indicator, which has demonstrated a positive effect on individual’s health outcomes.15, 17, 20, 32, 39, 40 With the implementation of the Patient-Driven Groupings Model, a value-based payment model for HH, the issue of timely initiation of HH service has become even more critical.41 Also, HH initiation is a quality measure that, along with other quality measures, formulates a composite scoring system for HH agency, also known as the 5-star rating system. The HH rating system is a publicly available platform, as part of the Care Compare initiative of Medicare, to compare performances of HHA.19, 42 Timely initiation of HH is one of the important quality measures, and person-centric for individuals with ADRD, who are even more vulnerable after acute hospitalization, and any delay in the start of home-based services could trigger negative health outcomes.

Second, hospital discharge is often overwhelming for patients and caregivers, especially those with ADRD. Steering patients to a particular PAC facility or referral to a specific HH agency is not allowed, and the discharge planners are required to provide choices to patients/caregivers. Furthermore, some of the recent legislative changes (e.g., Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014) mandate that in addition to providing a list of HH agencies (in this instance), information related to quality of services provided at these agencies needs to be part of the process.

Third, the quality of care provided by HH agencies is measured and reported using the HH star rating system, and that information is publicly available under the Medicare’s (Care) Compare web portal.43 The HH star rating is a composite rating system that ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score indicative of higher care quality. The rating system includes: quality of patient care (derived from Medicare claims and home health assessment data) and patient survey (using Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems).43 While a composite measure like the HH star rating system is very useful for comparing the performance of different HH agencies, and is particularly useful for developing new payment models that are value based rather than volume based, they often are inadequate for identifying modifiable factors for developing performance improvement plans. For example, HH latency, our primary variable of interest, can serve as an actionable and modifiable factor for improving care services. Health systems and clinicians can use HH latency as a “process of care” to enhance care coordination between upstream (hospitals) and downstream providers (HHA). Initiation of discharge process (to home with HH) while individuals are still in acute hospitals, with emphasis given to individuals from minority backgrounds, can eliminate unintended delay in the start of HH. With known relationships between delay in initiation of (HH) services with negative outcomes, our selection of HH latency as the primary variable of interest is a patient-centric variable. Future work examining the association between HH latency with health outcomes, and how this relationship differs for people of color with ADRD receiving HH in low- versus high-rated systems, is needed.

Our study has limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the study sample only included individuals enrolled under the traditional Medicare fee-for-service plan, and using 1 year of data (2016–2017). With a significant growth in Medicare Advantage plans and enrollees, it is important to examine whether this association holds. Also, it would be important to examine this association over time, and to examine COVID-related disruptions in HH services. Second, our study also did not account for acute and HH ownership or contractual arrangements. Care coordination between hospitals and HHA has grown significantly in recent years with several acute hospital-based health systems developing their own HH. Such relationships and how that is associated with early versus late initiation of HH need to be examined in future work. Third, this study does not include other patient-level barriers and home health logistical challenges such as (e.g., clinician safety, caregiver communications, patient autonomy), which may explain care delays. Fourth, we did not examine any patient-level outcomes, (e.g., impact on functional status, hospital readmission, etc.), as the primary purpose was to investigate the differences in timely initiation of HH, by race/ethnicity and quality of HH agencies. Finally, we did not develop a separate measure of HH quality ratings omitting—“How often the home health team began their patients’ care in a timely manner.” Developing such a measure was beyond the scope of this paper. However, by not doing so, we may have induced an endogeneity, which could have also affected our estimates. We acknowledge this as one of the major limitations of the study design and the findings need to be interpreted with that caveat. Future research must examine the impact of differences in the process of care variable (HH latency) on patient health outcomes, for individuals with ADRD.

In conclusion, our study found that Black patients with ADRD who were discharged from acute hospitals to lower rated HH agencies had a significant delay in initiation of HH services, compared to White and Hispanic patients. Our results are consistent with other studies that have identified differences in access to high-quality HH agencies by race/ethnicity, types of insurance, and other patient-level attributes.33, 44, 45 Delay in the initiation of HH services for individuals with ADRD could result in negative short- and long-term health outcomes. This impact can be exacerbated for people of color, for whom access to quality care remains to be a significant road-block in the care continuum. While identification of HH latency as a modifiable factor is the first important step, a qualitative investigation examining facilitators and barriers for early versus late initiation of HH services is needed.

Note: Model 1 was adjusted for- Age, Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Dual enrollment status, hospital length of stay, Elixhauser comorbidity index, hospital acquired conditions, respiratory status, mobility, selfcare and cognition scores at admission, beneficiary’s rural vs urban location, distance between beneficiary zip code and HHA service provider zip code, pain status, ICU admission status, living status, HHA rating, volume of ADRD patients in HHA for 2016-2017, poverty level in beneficiary neighborhood, physician availability in beneficiary neighborhood, concentration of HHA in beneficiary neighborhood. Model 2 was adjusted for all the same variables used in Model 1 except race/ethnicity and beneficiary location; race/ethnicity and HHA rating was combined to create 8 mutually exclusive groups.

Abbreviation: ADRD, Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; HHA, home health agencies; ICU, intensive care unit.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic Review:

We conducted a thorough review of literature, using PubMed, reports, conference proceedings, and presentations. While studies have examined delay in initiation of home health (HH) services, they were not done for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Also, while the issue of access to quality HH services has been examined in some recent studies, looking at a cumulative effect of racial/ethnic minority status with early access to HH services for individuals with ADRD has not been done previously.

2. Interpretation:

Our study findings indicate that Black patients with ADRD who were discharged from acute hospitals to lower rated HH agencies received HH services at a significantly delayed rate compared to White and Hispanic patients. This delay in the initiation of HH services for individuals with ADRD can negatively impact health outcomes.

3. Future Directions:

While identification of HH latency as a modifiable factor is the first important step, examining its impact on health outcomes is needed. Also needed is the identification of facilitators and barriers for early initiation of HH services.
