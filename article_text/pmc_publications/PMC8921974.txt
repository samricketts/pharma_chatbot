Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases without effective therapies. Immunotherapies using antibodies to lower assembled Aβ provide a promising approach and have been widely studied. Anti-amyloid antibodies are often selective to amyloid conformation, and the lack of amyloid-antibody structural information limits our understanding of these antibodies’ conformation selection. Gantenerumab and crenezumab are two anti-Aβ antibodies that bind multiple forms of Aβ with different Aβ epitope preferences. Here, using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we study the binding of these two antibodies to the Aβ1–40 fibril, whose conformation is derived from an AD patient’s brain tissue. We find that gantenerumab recognizes the Aβ1–11 monomer fragment only at slightly lower pH than the physiological environment where His6 of Aβ1–11 is protonated. Both gantenerumab and crenezumab bind with integrated Aβ fibril rather than binding to monomers within the fibril. Gantenerumab preferentially binds to the N-terminal region of the Aβ1–40 fibril, and the binding is driven by aromatic interactions. Crenezumab can recognize the N-terminal region, as well as the cross-section of the Aβ1–40 fibril, indicating its multiple binding modes in Aβ fibril recognition. These results demonstrate conformation-dependent interactions of antibody–amyloid recognition.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that causes impairment in brain functions such as memory and cognition.1 The amyloid hypothesis and tau hypothesis2,3 argue that amyloid-β (Aβ) senile plaques, formed by aggregated Aβ, and neuron fibril tangles, formed by highly phosphorylated tau proteins, are two main driving forces of AD.4 Aβ aggregates include dimers, oligomers, and fibrils according to their sizes and structures.5 Both Aβ oligomer and fibril contribute to the pathological process, while oligomeric Aβ species are reported to have stronger cytotoxicity.6–8 Therefore, clearing aggregated Aβ, especially oligomers, has emerged as a major therapeutic goal. The candidates for anti-Aβ drugs9,10 include nanoparticles,11 peptides,12 small molecules,13,14 and antibodies.15

Immunotherapies using antibodies to reduce assembled Aβ provide a promising approach and have been widely investigated since 1999.15 Both active and passive16 anti-Aβ immunotherapies are able to clear Aβ plaques17–20 with a possible mechanism of first antibody binding to Aβ followed by receptor-mediated efflux or Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis of antibody–Aβ complexes.19,21–23 While for a long time no success was achieved in clinical trials because of the unsatisfactory curative effect24–28 or several side effects,29 an anti-amyloid antibody aducanumab30 recently showed modest but significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial. Even though there is an ongoing debate about the results,31,32 it nevertheless provided important validation of amyloid as a therapeutic target.33

There are at least two factors causing the inconsistent results with antibody drugs against Aβ: the limited brain penetration and lack of selectivity for the soluble Aβ oligomers.33 Amyloids are known for their polymorphic conformations.34 As expected, as an intrinsically disordered protein, Aβ forms multiple structures of oligomers and fibrils under different conditions.35–40 Different soluble Aβ aggregates can give rise to cellular toxicity through different mechanisms.41 Because an amyloid-directed antibody may target only one or a few related potentially toxic protein variants, this could explain why such therapeutics have had little clinical impact.42 The situation is complicated further by the lack of structural details of antibody–amyloid recognition. The related crystal structures resolved so far are antibodies binding monomeric Aβ. There may be different characteristics between assembled Aβ and highly flexible monomeric Aβ when interacting with antibodies. Complementary to experiments, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can describe the Aβ-antibody interaction at an atomic level of detail. Zhao et al.43 simulated the recognition of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibril Aβ by three homologous antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab (C-mab), and CreneFab) and successfully identified stable complexes of C-mab with Aβ pentamer (oligomer model) and 16mer (fibril model). MD simulation showed that C-mab recognizes the oligomer’s lateral and edge residues, with CDR loops effectively binding to the Aβ fibril lateral surface around the same region spanning residues 13–16. A representative three-layered model of Aβ oligomer and fibril were used in Zhao’s study (PDB ID 2MXU40). While Zhao’s pioneering study provided insights into the antibody–amyloid interaction, further investigations are needed to cross-examine different amyloid conformations with different antibody interactions for better understanding the mechanisms of Aβ-based immunotherapy.

In this work, we focus on two antibodies, gantenerumab (G-mab) and crenezumab (C-mab) and their interactions with the amyloid conformers derived from the patienťs brain tissue (PDB ID 2M4J37). As the first full human anti-Aβ antibody, G-mab was reported to recognize Aβ fibrils, oligomers, and monomers in vitro, with the highest affinity for fibrils and lowest affinity for monomers.22 Studies in transgenic mice found that G-mab can effectively bind and reduce brain Aβ plaques but does not affect plasma Aβ.22,44 Phagocytosis of Aβ plaques induced by G-mab was observed in AD brain slices.22,23 Clinical studies showed a dose-dependent reduction in brain Aβ, but no benefit in cognition has been reported yet.23,45–47 Though vasogenic edema developed in several patients,23 G-mab was reported having an acceptable safety profile at a higher dose of 1200 mg.46 It has been shown that G-mab can reduce Aβ plaques in patients with prodromal to moderate AD.46 Epitope mapping revealed that G-mab can recognize both N-terminal (residues 1–12) and the middle segment (residues 23–28) of Aβ, but only structures of G-mab Fab binding with Aβ1–11 or Aβ3–11 monomers have been determined by X-ray diffraction method (PDB ID 5CSZ).22 In this complex, Aβ1–11 monomer contacts extensively with CDRs (H1, H2, H3, and L1) and with F4Aβ deeply buried in a hydrophobic pocket.

C-mab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is able to recognize Aβ monomer, oligomer, and fibril, with higher affinity for aggregated forms.48 C-mab can bind to Aβ plaques in the brain sections of both AD patients and transgenic mice.17 Compared to other antibodies, C-mab was not outstanding in lowing Aβ level but caused minimum inflammatory reactions in transgenic mice.18 The high safety performance was also confirmed by clinical studies.21 Lower oligomer level and higher monomer level were reported by Yang et al. in a 69-week clinical study,49 but no improvement of cognition has been observed as of now. Crystal structure of CreneFab (C-mab with different constant domain) in complex with Aβ13–24 monomer was resolved by Ultsch et al. in 2016 (PDB ID 5KNA).48 Aβ13–24 monomer, with an extended conformation, interacted with H1, H2, and L3. Solution NMR analysis revealed that CreneFab binds with Aβ1–42 monomer at the same epitope.48

The G-mab and C-mab have different preferred Aβ binding locations in aqueous solution. The G-mab can interact with both N-terminal and central regions of Aβ peptide, while the C-mab binds to the central motif of Aβ peptide. However, both of them can bind to monomeric, oligomeric, and fibril forms of Aβ, with increased affinities. In order to delineate the underlying mechanisms, we systematically simulate and examine the interactions of C-mab and G-mab with Aβ1–40 fibril consisting of 16 chains (PDB ID 2M4J,37 hereinafter referred to Aβ4016mer or Aβ40 fibril). We choose 16 chains to construct Aβ fibril because 16 chains can well represent fibril instead of oligomer and also for the purpose of binding energy comparison with previous study.43 We find that the protonation of His6 in Aβ is necessary for G-mab’s recognition of monomeric Aβ. Our results show that the G-mab–Aβ1–11 complex with neutral histidine is energetically unstable, which may explain the low affinity of G-mab with monomeric Aβ. In addition, on the basis of multiple MD simulations of 9 G-mab-Aβ4016mer complexes and 7 C-mab–Aβ4016mer complexes, we find that (1) G-mab binds to the N-terminus of the fibril mainly by π–π and salt bridge interactions, (2) C-mab binds to the N-terminal region of the fibril through Arg59L2–Ser8Aβ H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions, and (3) C-mab displays a strong interaction with the cross-section of the Aβ40 fibril by hydrophobic interactions with Met35Aβ. Our study demonstrates that antibody–Aβ fibril recognition depends on the amino acid sequences of antibody and the conformations of Aβ fibril.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Protonation of His6 of Aβ1–11 Controls G-mab–Aβ1–11 Interaction.

We first examine the structure of G-mab-Aβ1–11 complex (PDB ID 5CSZ). In the X-ray structure, there is a sulfate anion located near the His6Aβ. The distance between the N atom of the imidazole ring and the S atom of the sulfate anion is only 0.36 nm (Figure 1a), indicating that the His6 could be protonated. The weakly acidic crystallization conditions (25% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris 6.5, and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate)22 can further provide evidence for the protonation of His6. Therefore, we simulate two different G-mab–Aβ1–11 complexes, with His6Aβ in either protonated or neutral state. The average binding energies between Aβ1–11 and G-mab are calculated using the data from 50 to 100 ns. We find that the complex with neutral His6Aβ has a positive binding energy of 12.5 kcal/mol while the one with protonated His6Aβ has a negative binding energy of −24 kcal/mol (Figure 1b). These data demonstrate that G-mab can bind to Aβ1–11 with protonated His6 in low pH environment. The RMSF of G-mab is plotted in Figure 1c (light chain) and Figure 1d (heavy chain). The six CDR regions are highlighted by boxes. As can be seen in Figure 1c,d, both LC and HC regions in the complex with neutral-His6Aβ display obviously higher RMSF values than those in the complex with protonated-His6Aβ, suggesting that the protonated-His6Aβ complex is more stable than the neutral-His6Aβ complex. Interestingly, the residues with higher RMSF values are mainly located in regions outside the CDR domains, which do not interact directly with Aβ1–11, indicating the existence of an allosteric effect.

It has been found that G-mab could bind to Aβ monomer with a high dissociation rate (kd = 1.2 × 10–2 s−1),22 suggesting rapid exchange of antibody-bound monomeric Aβ. The pH sensitivity and high flexibility of the G-mab–Aβ complex observed in our simulations are consistent with the experimental findings.22 It should be noted that the 1–11 segment used in our simulation cannot replace the full-length peptide in G-mab–Aβ monomer recognition, since there were two epitopes (N-terminal and central region) revealed by experiment but only the complex of G-mab and Aβ1–11 was resolved. However, with the pH change from 7.4 to 6.4, only the charge of the histidine is altered. Since Aβ1–11 is the strongest epitope of G-mab, we can still conclude that the nonprotonation of His6Aβ at neutral pH will decrease the affinity of Aβ1–40 monomer and G-mab.

G-mab and C-mab Bind with Integrated Aβ40 Fibril Rather than Binding Monomer within the Fibril.

We searched the stable structures of G-mab/C-mab binding with Aβ40 fibril by a combination of initial docking and subsequent MD simulations. Since G-mab mostly binds to Aβ40 N-terminal region, a large number of combinations are generated due to the 3-fold symmetry of the Aβ40 fibril conformation. Three clusters of docking poses were selected based on Aβ404 fibril epitope, and we chose 2–3 structures with the lowest energy from each cluster. (Figure S1). In the first group (G-MD1, G-MD2, and G-MD3), G-mab binds to the joint region between two Aβ monomers, where the N-terminal residues of one Aβ monomer interact with the middle region residues of the other Aβ monomer. The second group (G-MD4, and G-MD5) includes the conformers in which G-mab only binds to Aβ N-terminal residues. In the third group (G-MD6, G-MD7, and G-MD8), G-mab binds to the cross-section A40β fibril, rather than the lateral surface. Similarly, 6 structures of C-mab-A40 16mer complex were selected as the initial states (data not shown).

We then performed 20 ns MD simulations starting from these structures and discarded some systems in which the antibody and Aβ were obviously separated from each other. The remaining 10 systems were extended to 100 ns, including two C-mab-Aβ4016mer complexes (C-MD1, C-MD2) and eight G-mab-Aβ40 16mer complexes (G-MD1–8).

In order to examine the possibility of antibody binding to only one monomer within fibril, we used the Chimera software50 to construct two antibody–Aβ4016mer complexes (C-MD0 and G-MD0), in which the epitope fragments (residue 13–22 in C-MD0 and residue 1–11 in G-MD0) in the 16th chain (the edge chain) of Aβ40 fibril were replaced by the Aβ segment in the crystal structure. These two complexes, together with the above ten complexes, were subjected to 100 ns MD simulations.

We first examined if the antibody can bind one monomer within the fibrils and keep the binding interactions in the same ways as in the crystal structure. This question can be answered using the data from the 100 ns simulations of the G-MD0 and C-MD0 systems. The results are shown in Figure 2a; the LC and HC regions of antibodies are colored in pink and green, respectively. The Aβ segments binding to antibodies are highlighted in yellow, and the remaining regions of Aβ40 fibrils are shown in blue. Their binding energies are positive (Figure 2b), indicating that extracting one monomer from Aβ40 fibril by these antibodies is energetically unfavorable.

The structures of the ten systems with the antibodies binding with integrated fibril can be seen in Figure S1. We examined the average binding energy between Aβ40 fibril and antibodies using the conformations in the last 50 ns. Systems with positive binding energy are considered to be unstable. As seen in Figure 3a, three systems with negative binding energy are considered to be the stable structures: (1) G-mab binding with the of the N-terminal residues of Aβ40 fibril on the lateral surface (G-MD4), (2) C-mab binding with the N-terminal residues of Aβ40 fibril on the lateral surface (C-MD1), and (3) C-mab interacting with the cross-section of Aβ40 fibril (C-MD2). Snapshots of the three stable structures at 0 and 100 ns are shown in Figure 3b. These results indicate that G-mab and C-mab preferentially bind to integrated fibril, rather than monomer within fibril.

The Binding of G-mab to the N-Terminal Region of Aβ40 Fibril Is Driven by Aromatic Interactions.

Bohrmann et al.22 proposed a model of G-mab binding to the Aβ fibril surface in their experiment study: G-mab first binds to the disordered N-terminus, followed by its binding to the 19VFFAEDVG26 segment on the fibril surface. However, in the last section, we have shown that binding to the disordered N-terminus is energetically unfavorable. For the Aβ fibril structure in the 2M4J conformation, we find that G-mab binds on the lateral surface of Aβ fibril in the N-terminal region. The contact map between each residue of Aβ and G-mab is plotted in Figure 4a to gain an overall understanding of G-mab-Aβ4016mer interactions. The epitope revealed by X-ray experiment is highlighted in the blue box. As can be seen in Figure 4a, the Aβ interaction region from simulation (residue 1–15) is highly maintained as that in crystal structure (residue 1–13), indicating that G-mab recognizes a similar epitope for both Aβ monomer and Aβ fibril. H2 and H3 regions contribute the most contacts among all the residues of the CDR.

We examine residue-residue interactions within the binding site by summing up the contact numbers of each kind of residue for Aβ and G-mab (Figure 4b). The residue with the highest contact number in Aβ is Tyr, significantly larger than the second one (His). Similarly, His and Tyr in G-mab contribute the largest and second-largest contact numbers, respectively. Furthermore, most residue pairs with top contact numbers are Tyr–Tyr, Tyr–His, or His–His (Table 1). Both Tyr and His are aromatic residues, indicating that π–π interactions play an important role in G-mab-Aβ4016mer interaction. To further characterize the π–π interactions, we calculate the average π–π stacking numbers and distance for each aromatic residue pair between Aβ and G-mab. As seen in Figure 4d, the six aromatic residue pairs with the top π–π stacking number are Tyr107H3-His6Aβ, Tyr93L3-Tyr10Aβ, Tyr109H3-Tyr10Aβ, Tyr59H2-Tyr10Aβ, His104H3-His6Aβ, and Tyr33L1-Tyr10Aβ, and their angle distributions are plotted in Figure 4e. A snapshot of the interface is presented in Figure 4f to show the importance of π–π stacking intuitively. A large amount of π–π interaction pairs can be seen at the interface. The snapshots of the top two pairs (Tyr107H3-His6Aβ and Tyr93L3-Tyr10Aβ) are placed on the right side of panel Figure 4f. There are also many polar or charged residues located at the N-terminal of Aβ. Thus, H-bonding and electrostatic interactions also play roles in the G-mab-Aβ4016mer interactions. The H-bond number matrix is plotted in Figure 4g. H2 loop of G-mab can form strong H-bonds with segment Ser8–Tyr10Aβ, while H3 loop can form H-bond extensively with Aβ1–11 segment. Three salt bridges exist between Aβ and G-mab: Lys105H3-Glu3Aβ, Lys105H3-Asp1Aβ, and Arg57H2–Glu11Aβ. The PDF of the distance of the three pairs with opposite charges is plotted in Figure 4h, and the snapshots are given in Figure 4i. All three curves exhibit sharp peaks in distance = 0.28 nm, indicating the formation of salt bridges in the three pairs. In short, the binding of G-mab to the lateral of Aβ40 fibril is stabilized by π–π stacking, H-bonding, and salt bridge interactions. It is interesting to note that these interactions are shared for small molecules binding with Aβ fibrils as well, similar binding sites and mechanism were also observed in several computational works.51–55 We also calculate the above interactions in G-MD5 system, which has similar structures with G-MD4 but positive binding energy (Figure S1). Data show that the number of both π–π stacking and salt bridges in G-MD5 are significantly smaller than that in G-MD4 (Figure S2), further underlining the importance of π–π stacking and salt bridges on the binding between G-mab and N-terminal region of Aβ.

Interestingly, our simulations showed that Aβ1–11 monomer with neutral histidine (HSD6) cannot form a stable complex with G-mab, while Aβ fibril with HSD6 can be recognized by G-mab in the N-terminal region, indicating that the pH dependence is specific to the binding of G-mab to Aβ1–11. Currently, there is no report about the protonation state of histidine residues in the Aβ fibril. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we compared the G-mab–Aβ1–11 interaction between system G-Aβ1–11(HSD6) and system G-MD4. The contact maps in Figure S3 show different binding modes of G-mab to Aβ1–40 fibril and Aβ1–11 monomer. In system G-MD4, the interaction concentrates on residues 6–11Aβ and CDRs H2/H3, while in system G–Aβ1–11(HSD6), G-mab mainly recognizes residues 1–5 with L3/H1/H2/H3.

Multiple Binding Modes of C-mab in Aβ40 Fibril Recognition.

The binding characteristics of C-mab in recognizing Aβ40 fibril with the 2M4J conformation through the lateral interface are summarized in Figure 5 and Table 2. Even though the C-mab is an antibody that was reported to mainly recognize the central region of Aβ fibril (residues 12–28),48 we find that it can also bind to Aβ4016mer N-terminal region in the 2M4J conformation (Figure 5a). The main epitope residues are Tyr10, Ser8, and His6 of Aβ (Figure 5b), interacting with paratope residues Ser, Asn, and Arg of C-mab (Figure 5c). The top six residue pairs with the highest contact numbers are listed in Table 2. The first pair is Arg59L2 and Ser8Aβ, maintained by an extremely stable H-bond (the existence probability is 100%), which can also be seen in the H-bond number matrix in Figure 5d. Further calculation reveals that the Arg59L2–Ser8Aβ H-bond is mainly formed between the main-chain of Arg59L2 and the side-chain of Ser8Aβ (~91%). The other five pairs are Asn33L1–Tyr10Aβ, Ser31H1–His14Aβ, Ser61L2–Tyr10Aβ, Asn58L2–Ser8Aβ, and Phe60L2–Tyr10Aβ. Interestingly, despite the existence of polar residues Asn, Ser, and His and aromatic residues His, Tyr, and Phe, almost no hydrogen bond or π–π stacking is formed among the five pairs (Table 2), which illustrates that the main stabilizing force is hydrophobic interaction (for example, between the aromatic ring of Tyr10Aβ and the nonpolar aliphatic groups of Asn33L1). Albeit with very low formation stabilities, π–π stacking interactions are observed in three pairs of aromatic residues: Tyr31L1–Tyr10Aβ, Phe60L2–Tyr10Aβ, and Tyr32H1–His14Aβ (Figure 5e). The PDF of angles in π–π stacking are plotted in Figure 5f. The snapshots of typical π–π stacking are shown in Figure 5g. No salt bridge is observed between Aβ and C-mab. To sum up, the binding of C-mab to the N-terminal region of Aβ40 fibril is primarily by Arg59L2–Ser8Aβ H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In system C-MD1, C-mab recognizes the N-terminal region of Aβ40 fibril mainly by L1 and L2 loops (Figure 5a), two CDRs with relatively high content of aromatic and charged residues. However, the π–π and electrostatic interactions in C-MD1 are not as important as those in G-MD4, which can be explained by the sequence difference of C-mab and G-mab. According to Figure 5h, most of the aromatic and charged residues in H2 and H3 of G-mab are centered around the middle of CDRs, while those in L1 and L2 of C-mab are located in the ends of loops, which greatly reduce the freedom of C-mab aromatic and charged residues that interact with Aβ40 fibril. The similar N-terminal binding position of Aβ40 fibril but totally different mechanisms between C-MD1 and G-MD4 indicate the importance of sequence specificity for antibody in recognizing Aβ fibril.

Previously, we studied the C-mab binding to the central region of Aβ11–42 fibril (16mer) with the S-shaped 2MXU conformer.43 It is interesting to see that C-mab used different paratope residues to interact with Aβ fibril with different conformations, with similar binding energies (−195.8 kcal/mol for C-mab and Aβ11–4216mer and −201.2 kcal/mol for C-mab and Aβ1–4016mer). In the C-mab/Aβ11–42 binding pattern, the C-mab mainly uses its heavy chain, while in the C-mab/Aβ1–4016mer with the 2M4J conformation, the C-mab mainly uses the light chain. We find that only S31H1 is involved in both binding modes.

In this study, we also examine the possibility of an antibody to bind with Aβ40 fibril on its cross-section. While we do not find an energetically favorable binding mode for G-mab, the system C-MD2 is found to be a stable C-mab–Aβ4016mer complex of C-mab and Aβ. The binding energy for the C-mab binding on the cross-section of Aβ is very low (−366.7 kcal vs −201.2 kcal/mol for C-MD1), indicating strong binding interactions.

We calculated the contact numbers between each residue of C-mab and Aβ (Figure 6a). Data show that residues in all of six CDRs participate in contact with the Aβ40 fibril, while the involved residues of Aβ are mainly distributed in the C-terminal region (29GAIIGLMVGGVV40). Total contact number for each residue of Aβ with C-mab in Figure 6b shows that Met35 contributes most to C-mab–Aβ4016mer interactions, followed by Val40 and Gly33. Remarkably, Met35 plays an important role in stabilizing the Aβ fibril (PDB ID 2M4J).37 Previous studies also reported that the oxidation or mutation of Met35 can greatly reduce the formation rate and neurotoxicity of Aβ aggregates.56,57 The top six contact pairs in Table 3 indicate that M35Aβ mainly contacts aromatic residues Tyr31L1 and Tyr32H1, and the representative snapshots are presented in Figure 6c. The hydrophobic interactions between Tyr residues in C-mab and Met35Aβ help CDR loops stretch into and firmly bind to the cross section of the Aβ40 fibril, which may disaggregate the fibril.

Polar interactions are also essential in C-mab recognizing the Aβ40 fibril. As shown in Table 3, Asn33L1–Gly33Aβ form strong hydrogen-bonding interactions mainly between main-chains (~84.2%). H-bonds for Asn33L1–Ile32Aβ and Asn33L1–Gly33Aβ are relatively weak. More H-bond pairs can be seen in Figure 6d. Salt bridges are observed for the Arg59L2 and Glu11Aβ pair (Figure 6e). Snapshots showing the Arg59L2–Glu11Aβ salt bridge and Asn33L1–Gly33Aβ H-bond are given in Figure 6f. In a word, C-mab in C-MD2 can firmly bind with the cross section of Aβ40 fibril by hydrophobic interactions between Tyr residues of C-mab (Tyr31L1 and Tyr32H1) and Met35Aβ, Arg59L2–Glu11Aβ salt bridge, and Asn33L1–Gly33Aβ H-bonds. In comparison with the binding of C-mab on the lateral surface of the Aβ40 fibril, binding on the cross section of Aβ40 fibril, though with the small binding surface area, would effectively recognize Aβ40 fibril and block the elongation of Aβ40 fibrils.

CONCLUSIONS

The recognition ability of an antibody to the disease-related amyloid conformers may determine its potential effectiveness toward amyloid inhibition in a patients’ brain. In this study, we compare two different antibodies, gantenerumab (G-mab) and crenezumab (C-mab), focusing on the structure of the antibody–Aβ complexes and interaction features with the amyloid conformer 2M4J derived from a patient’s brain. Using all atom MD simulations, we investigate the influence of two protonation states of His6Aβ on G-mab binding with Aβ1–11 monomer and screen the possible binding modes of G-mab/C-mab with Aβ4016mer. We find that G-mab recognizes Aβ1–11 monomer fragment only in slightly lower pH than that of the physiological environment, when His6 of Aβ1–11 is protonated. Since His6 is most likely to be neutral under physiological conditions, our results may explain the low affinity of G-mab and Aβ monomer in vitro and in mouse experiments.22,44

Through extensive search of possible binding modes of antibodies with the Aβ4016mer in the 2M4J conformation, we identify three stable structures of antibodies binding to Aβ40 fibril (one G-mab–Aβ4016mer complex (G-MD4) and two C-mab–Aβ4016mer complexes (C-MD1 and C-MD2)). G-MD4 and C-MD1 share a common feature of antibody binding on the lateral part of the Aβ40 fibril N-terminal region but with totally different molecular mechanisms. The binding of G-mab to Aβ N-terminus is mainly through many of π–π interactions and three pairs of salt bridges (Lys105H3–Glu3Aβ, Lys105H3–Asp1Aβ, and Arg57H2–Glu11Aβ), while the binding of C-mab to Aβ N-terminus is mainly through Arg59L2–Ser8Aβ H-bond and hydrophobic interactions. Their interaction difference results from distinct CDR sequences between the G-mab and the C-mab, reflecting the sequence specificity of antibodies. In the C-MD2 system, the C-mab binds on the cross section of the Aβ40 fibril, with CDR loops stretching into and interacting extensively with the hydrophobic C-terminal region of Aβ, especially with Met35Aβ. Arg59L2–Glu11Aβ salt bridge and Asn33L1–Gly33Aβ H-bond also contribute greatly to C-mab–Aβ4016mer interactions. It is noteworthy that both G-mab and C-mab are able to recognize the central region of Aβ as reported by experiments. However, stable structures of antibodies binding at the central region are not available in our simulations. According to the experiments, residues His13, His14, Lys16, Phe19, Phe20, Glu22, and Asp23 in Aβ contribute significantly to C-mab–Aβ interactions in crystal structures.48 Despite the lack of information about atomic structure, we can infer from system G-MD4 that the aromatic residues Phe19 and Phe20 and charged residues Glu22 and Asp23 will play an important role in G-mab recognition of the Aβ central region. However, the side chain of residues His13, Phe19, Phe20, and Asp23 are pointing toward the interior of the Aβ40 fibril with structure 2M4J, making it unfavorable for antibodies binding with the central region of Aβ. To investigate if our simulation results can be extended to other fibril structures, we compared the exposed residues of four full-length Aβ fibril models (2M4J,37 6SHS,58 5OQV,36 2NAO59). It can be seen in Figure S4 that some residues in the N-terminal region (residues 1–6) in fibril 2M4J are exposed and available to antibodies, while fibril 2NAO has a longer exposed N-terminal region (residues 1–14) than 2M4J. Models 6SHS and 5OQV exhibit very similar solvation-exposure mode in the N-terminal region (residues 1–14): half of the residues are exposed to solvent. According to the different solvent-exposure, the order of antibody–N-terminal region binding affinities can be estimated as follows: 2NAO &gt; 2M4J &gt; 6SHS = 5OQV. In addition, our simulations reveal that C-mab can bind to the cross-section of fibril 2M4J through hydrophobic interaction mainly with M35Aβ (C-MD2). Both 5OQV and 2NAO have a packed C-terminus with the side chain of M35Aβ pointing toward the inner surface, indicating that they may adopt a similar binding mode with C-MD2. It is noteworthy that the side chains of M35Aβ point outward in 6SHS, which might result in a new complex structure in which C-mab binds to the lateral part of the fibril at the C-terminus. It is known that amyloid antibodies are amyloid conformation sensitive, and we are going to examine these differences and antibody/amyloid conformation selection in future studies.

Overall, both C-mab and G-mab bind with integrated Aβ40 fibril rather than binding to monomers within the fibril. The binding of G-mab at the N-terminal region of the Aβ40 fibril is driven by aromatic interactions. C-mab may have multiple binding modes in Aβ fibril recognition. The interaction energy of C-mab with the N-terminal region of the Aβ1–40 fibril is comparable to that of C-mab binding to the central region of Aβ17–42 fibril in S-shaped three β-sheet conformation. These results clearly demonstrate conformation-dependent antibody-Aβ recognition.

METHODS

System Preparation.

The structure of G-mab is taken from the crystal structure 5CSZ22 with the Aβ1–11 fragment removed. The missing sequences are modeled by SWISS-MODEL.60 The structure of C-mab is modeled using the Web server PIGSPro61 with a template of 5KNA, as the CreneFab in that crystal structure is a mutant version of the C-mab with 9 mutated residues.48 The CDR loops are defined according to the Kabat62 definition and listed in Table 4. The structure of Aβ40 fibril (16mer) is constructed according to the ssNMR structure (PDB ID 2M4J37).

Using the web server HADDOCK,63 we perform antibody–Aβ4016mer complex molecular docking to search for their potential binding modes. The active residues during docking processes are those in the CDR loops of antibodies and the residues 1–6, 7–15, and 15–24 of Aβ40 fibril.

MD Simulations.

The four disulfide bonds in antibodies are kept according to the IgG subtypes. Both the N-termini and C-termini in antibodies/Aβ are charged as NH3+ and COO− groups. We first solvate the complex structures using TIP3P water molecules64 with a rectangular box, followed by adding Na+/Cl− with a concentration of 0.15 M to mimic a neutral condition.

Each solvated system is gradually relaxed by performing energy minimizations with 10000 steps using conjugate gradient method,65 in which proteins are first restrained and then set flexible to optimize the protein–water interactions. After all the systems achieve equilibrium, we perform a 100 ns MD simulation for each system using the NAMD software66 with CHARMM36 force field.67 All simulations are carried out in the NPT ensemble at a temperature of 310 K and a pressure of 1 bar. The MD trajectories are saved every 2 ps for analysis. A summary of all simulation systems is listed in Table 5.

To check the convergence and repeatability of our simulations, we perform another 100 ns simulation for each of the three stable antibody–Aβ fibril systems (C-MD1, C-MD2, and G-MD4). Convergence check is given in Supporting Information (Figures S5 and S6) and shows that our simulations are reasonably converged.

Analysis.

All the analyses are based on the last 50 ns trajectories using our in-house-developed codes and tools in the NAMD/GROMACS software package.66,68 Here we employ the widely used MM-GBMV (molecular mechanism-generalized born with molecular volume) method69 to calculate the free energy. The binding energy between antibody and Aβ is calculated using 〈Ebind〉 = 〈Ecomplex〉 − 〈Eantibody〉 − 〈EAβ〉, where 〈Ecomplex〉, 〈Eantibody〉, and 〈EAβ〉 all consist of the gas phase energy and the solvation free energy. The conformational entropy is not accounted in MM-GBMV method as done in previous works,43,70–73 because the contribution of entropy to total free energy is much smaller than the other items.74–76 Overall, the binding energy calculated by MM-GBMV without entropy provide a reasonable estimate.43,70 The dielectric constant of water is set to 80. Simulations of isolated C-mab, G-mab, Aβ40 fibril, and Aβ1–11 monomer are performed for the calculation of GBMV energy.

We define a contact as the distance between two heavy atoms being within a distance cutoff. The contact cutoff for two carbon atoms is 0.54 nm; otherwise it is 0.46 nm. Two conditions are needed to define a hydrogen bond (H-bond): (i) the N–O distance is less than 0.35 nm and (ii) the angle of N–H···O is larger than 150°. Positively charged residues and negatively charged residues can form salt bridges when the minimal distance between the N atom of NH3+ group and the COO− group is less than 0.4 nm. For the case of Arg, we include all three side-chain N atoms. Two aromatic rings are considered to form a π–π stacking if their central distance is less than 0.65 nm.77–79 The structure representations are drawn using the VMD software.80
