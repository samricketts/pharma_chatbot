Introduction:

The ATN framework provides an in vivo diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of pathologic amyloid plaques (A), tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N). ATN is rarely evaluated in pathologically confirmed patients and its poor sensitivity to suspected non-Alzheimer’s pathophysiologies (SNAP), including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), leads to misdiagnoses. We compared accuracy of ATN (ATNTAU) using CSF total tau (t-tau) to a modified strategy (ATNNfL) using CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) in an autopsy cohort.

Methods:

ATNTAU and ATNNfL were trained in an independent sample and validated in autopsy-confirmed AD (n = 67) and FTLD (n = 27).

Results:

ATNNfL more accurately identified FTLD as SNAP (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.94) than ATNTAU (sensitivity = 0.44, specificity = 0.97), even in cases with co-occurring AD and FTLD. ATNNfL misclassified fewer AD and FTLD as “Normal” (2%) than ATNTAU (14%).

Discussion:

ATNNfL is a promising diagnostic strategy that may accurately identify both AD and FTLD, even when pathologies co-occur.

1 | INTRODUCTION

The 2018 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association ATN research framework is a flexible algorithm that combines biomarkers to provide a diagnosis along a continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based ATN uses amyloid beta 1-to-42 peptide (Aβ1–42), tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), and total tau (t-tau) to determine positive (+) or negative (−) status for amyloid deposition (A), tangle formation (T), and neurodegeneration (N), respectively. While individual biomarkers provide a binary diagnosis of AD or non-AD, the innovation of ATN is that it aims to provide a more detailed biologically based profile. Individuals negative for “Alzheimer’s continuum disease” (A−) can be classified as normal or suspected non-Alzheimer’s pathophysiology (SNAP); individuals positive for “Alzheimer’s continuum disease” (A+) can be classified as early Alzheimer’s pathologic change, AD, or even concomitant SNAP and AD. This diagnostic detail has the potential to inform eligibility criteria in treatment trials or disease management strategies. However, evaluations of CSF-based ATN mainly focus on prediction of clinical outcomes,2–4 and all have overlooked the detection of SNAP. Investigations of ATN are still needed because only rare studies have tested diagnostic accuracy in a pathologically confirmed sample.5

Stratification of a heterogeneous cohort during life is challenging, especially in the face of commonly co-occurring pathologies6 and phenotypic overlap,7–9 such as with AD and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In the ATN framework, distinguishing SNAP from AD is critically dependent on N status. However, our previous study in autopsy patients showed that CSF-based ATN profiles poorly detect FTLD as SNAP,5 due in large part to relatively low t-tau in FTLD compared to AD.10–12 As such, FTLD and other forms of SNAP are likely to be overlooked in the presence of secondary AD pathology,13 because biomarkers for SNAP are lacking. Moreover, because t-tau concentrations are highly correlated with p-tau,14 there may be little added value of t-tau when diagnosing AD using ATN.15–17

This study tested CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) as an alternative marker of N.4 NfL is an axonal protein, and elevated CSF NfL is a marker of several neurodegenerative conditions18,19 including AD and FTLD.20–23 One previous study has tested ATN using NfL in a clinically defined population, showing NfL was associated with neuroimaging metrics of N and might be a valuable marker in pre-clinical patients.4 In this study, we compared two CSF-based ATN strategies in autopsy-confirmed AD and FTLD, including patients with mixed pathology: CSF Aβ1–42 and p-tau markers of A and T were combined with either t-tau (ATNTAU) or NfL (ATNNfL) as alternative markers of N. First, we established cut-points for NfL and t-tau in an independent sample of controls and patients with familial forms of FTLD (fFTLD) or AD (fAD). Cut-points were then validated in autopsy-confirmed AD and FTLD patients to test classification accuracy of ATNTAU and ATNNfL. To provide a more accurate diagnosis along the AD continuum, a successful framework will be sensitive to both FTLD as SNAP and AD, even when pathologies co-occur.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Independent training subjects

Using the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Database (INDD),24,25 we identified an independent sample of healthy controls (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]≥2826 and/or modified Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] scale = 027) and symptomatic patients with fFTLD or fAD, and thus known underlying FTLD28 and AD29,30 neuropathology, respectively. Eligibility criteria included completed assays for CSF biomarkers and propensity score matching was used to select controls that were age- and sex-matched to familial patients. In total there were 22 controls and 22 familial symptomatic cases, including 17 fFTLD patients (10 C9orf72; 2 GRN; 2 MAPT; 3 TARDBP) and 5 fAD patients (4 PSEN1; 1 PSEN2). One fFTLD patient had a completed assay for CSF NfL but not t-tau. Table 1A provides descriptive statistics for controls and familial patients. Participants’ consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Penn Institutional Review Board (IRB).

2.2 | Autopsy patients

Patients were autopsied at the Penn Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research and selected through INDD. Inclusion criteria were a primary pathological diagnosis of AD or FTLD and completed assays for CSF biomarkers (67 AD; 27 FTLD). Patients with co-occurring neurologic conditions were excluded (eg, stroke, hydrocephalus, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or secondary cerebrovascular disease at autopsy). Consent for antemortem data was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Penn IRB. This is a retrospective study, and subsets of these data have appeared in previous publications.5,31

Primary pathological diagnosis was based on the judgment of experienced neuropathologists (JQT, EBL). FTLD pathology was determined by accumulations of misfolded tau (FTLD-Tau) or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43; FTLD-TDP).32,33 Severity of AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) was rated using “ABC” criteria (not/low/intermediate/high)34; AD pathology was defined by intermediate or high ADNC. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) GT-7 and GT-38 immunohistochemistry determined Braak stage for FTLD-tau, because these mAbs are specific for AD-tau pathology.35,36 Patients were systematically assessed for the co-occurrence of other pathologic conditions. For AD, 50 of 67 (75%) had mixed pathology, including three cases with co-occurring FTLD-tau. Other co-pathological conditions included hippocampal sclerosis, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), and α-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies.32,37 AD patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy were considered to have “negligible” co-pathology. For FTLD, 7 of 27 (26%) had mixed pathology, 2 with co-occurring AD (1 high ADNC, 1 intermediate ADNC); the remaining had negligible ADNC (13 low, 12 not). Other co-pathological conditions for FTLD included α-synuclein, co-occurring FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, and hippocampal sclerosis. If negligible/no form of clinically meaningful co-pathology was detected, pathology was considered “pure.”

Table 1B describes characteristics of AD and FTLD autopsy patients, including age of disease onset (earliest reported symptom), age at CSF, disease duration (years from onset to CSF), interval to death (years from CSF to death), MMSE, survival (years from onset to death), and education.

2.3 | CSF analysis

CSF samples were collected and measured for NfL using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of UmanDiagnostics (UmanDiagnostics, Umeå, Sweden), and for Aβ1–42, p-tau, and t-tau using the xMAP Luminex platform38 (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium). Laboratory technicians performed CSF analyses blinded to clinical data.

2.4 | Statistical analysis

2.4.1 | Independent sample

Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) performed between-group comparisons, with age and sex as covariates. Because t-tau and NfL are not normally distributed, log(t-tau) and -NfL−½ transformations were applied. Effect size for ANCOVAs was calculated using partial η2 (0.01 is considered small, 0.09 medium, and 0.25 large).

While established cut-points from an autopsy-confirmed sample exist for CSF Aβ1–42, p-tau, and t-tau,39 the variability in measurement techniques across different sites for NfL limits establishment of broadly applicable cut-points. To minimize bias, we calculated optimal cut-points for t-tau and NfL based on Youden’s index in an independent sample of control and familial patients (fFTLD and fAD). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and area under the curve (AUC) assessed diagnostic accuracy of each biomarker when discriminating familial patients from controls; sensitivity and specificity for optimal cut-points are reported. DeLong’s test for two correlated ROC curves compared biomarkers pairwise.

2.4.2 | Autopsy patients

ANCOVAs (type II sum of squares) performed group-wise comparisons of t-tau and NfL across pathologies (AD, FTLD). Covariates included co-pathology (pure, mixed), age at CSF, interval to death, sex, and MMSE. MMSE was not available for two AD and two FTLD patients. As above, log(t-tau) and -NfL−½ transformations were applied.

Cut-points established in the independent sample determined NTAU and NNfL status for each autopsy patient. Interpretation of ATN profiles are as follows1: Normal = A−T−N−; Alzheimer’s continuum = A+T−N−, A+T+N−, A+T+N+; Alzheimer’s and SNAP = A+T−N+; SNAP = A−T+N−, A−T−N+, A−T+N+. Fisher’s tests compared classification accuracy for ATNTAU and ATNNfL. ROC and AUC assessed diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers when discriminating FTLD from AD, and DeLong’s test compared CSF biomarkers.

Analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment,40 using MatchIt,41 Companion to Applied Regression (car),42 multcomp,43 and partial ROC (pROC)44 packages.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | CSF t-tau and CSF NfL in training sample of controls and familial disease cases

3.1.1 | Between-group comparisons

ANCOVAs show familial patients had significantly higher t-tau (F[1,39] = 9.6, P = .0036) and NfL (F[1,40] = 23.4, P = 2.0 × 10−5) than controls (Figure 1); age and sex were included covariates (all P &gt; .2). Effect size was medium for t-tau (partial η2 = 0.2) and large for NfL (partial η2 = 0.37).

3.1.2 | Diagnostic comparisons

ROC analyses tested discrimination of familial patients from controls (Table 2). DeLong’s tests confirmed that NfL had better performance than Aβ1–42 (Z = 2, P = .044) and p-tau (Z = 4.7, P = 2.4 × 10−6); there was no difference between NfL and t-tau (P = .24). ROC analyses were repeated to examine discrimination of fFTLD from controls, excluding fAD. Optimal cut-points were the same for both t-tau (51.5 pg/mL) and NfL (1073.781 pg/mL), but discrimination of fFTLD from controls was higher for NfL (AUC = 1.0, sensitivity = 1.0, specificity = 0.95) than t-tau (AUC = 0.74, sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.73), confirmed by DeLong’s test (D = 3.1, P = .002).

3.2 | Comparisons of t-tau and NfL concentrations across AD and FTLD

3.2.1 | Demographic comparisons

AD patients were significantly older at CSF than FTLD, consistent with their older onset age; they also had a longer interval to death, lower MMSE, and higher rates of co-pathology than FTLD (Table 1B).

ANCOVAs showed that both t-tau (F[1,83] = 13.6, P = 4.0 × 10−4, partial η2 = 0.14) and NfL (F[1,83] = 36.4, P = 4.3 × 10−8, partial η2 = 0.30) significantly differed across pathologies (Figure 2). Because NfL is generally higher in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) than other forms of FTLD,31,45 we repeated NfL analyses excluding FTLD-ALS cases. Results were consistent, with significantly higher NfL in FTLD than AD (F[1,77] = 36.1, P = 5.8 × 10−8, partial η2 = 0.32).

Between-group comparisons covariates included co-pathology (pure, mixed), age, interval from CSF to death, sex (male, female), and MMSE. Co-pathology was not significant in either model (both P &gt; .5), nor was interval to death (both P &gt; .1). Age was associated with NfL (F[1,83] = 8.9, P = .0037) but not t-tau (P = .69). Males had lower t-tau levels than females (F[1,83]) = 5, p = .028), but sex was not significant for NfL (P = .22). Lower MMSE was associated with higher NfL (F[1,83] = 4.4, P = .040), but not t-tau (P = .26).

3.3 | ATN classifications in autopsy AD and FTLD

3.3.1 | ATN classifications

We compared the classification of AD and FTLD patients using ATNTAU (Table 3A) and ATNNfL (Table 3B). ATNNfL correctly identified SNAP in 25 of 27 FTLD patients, and was more sensitive to SNAP (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.94) than ATNTAU (sensitivity = 0.44, specificity = 0.94), confirmed by Fisher’s test (n = 12; odds ratio [OR] = 14.8, confidence interval [CI] = 2.8–153.6, P = 2.7 × 10−4). When diagnosing AD, ATNNfL (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 1) and ATNTAU (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 0.85) were highly accurate; ATNTAU and ATNNfL were equally sensitive to “Alzheimer’s continuum disease” because this was determined by A+ status (Aβ1–42 ≤ 192 pg/mL) for both strategies. Finally, fewer patients were misclassified as “Normal” under ATNNfL (specificity = 0.98) than ATNTAU (specificity = 0.86), confirmed by Fisher’s test (OR = 0.14, CI = 0.01 −0.63, P = .0053).

Detailed ATN classifications are provided in Table S1 in supporting information. CSF Aβ1–42 misclassified four FTLDpure cases as A+, despite little AD pathology detected at autopsy (ADNC low or not). Of these, 100% were misdiagnosed by ATNTAU as early “Alzheimer’s pathologic change” (A+T−N−), missing the primary pathology of FTLD, while ATNNfL classified all four A+ FTLD cases as “concomitant Alzheimer’s and SNAP” (A+T−NNfL+). All three AD with co-occurring FTLD-tau were NNfL+ and NTAU+.

ROC analyses compared diagnostic accuracy of individual biomarkers when discriminating FTLD from AD: CSF Aβ1–42 (AUC = 0.96), p-tau (AUC = 0.94), t-tau (AUC = 0.85), and NfL (AUC = 0.87). DeLong’s tests comparing ROC curves pairwise showed that CSF t-tau had a significantly lower AUC than both CSF Aβ1–42 (D = −2.3, P = .018) and p-tau (D = −2.4, P = .017); no other pair of biomarkers differed from each other (NfL vs Aβ1–42 P = .059; all other P &gt; .1)

3.4 | Post hoc analyses in AD

Because ATNNfL had excellent performance identifying FTLD as SNAP, follow-up analyses investigated the interpretation of NNfL status in AD. We tested if pathological subtype related to NNfL status in AD (see supporting information for full analyses). The majority of AD had concomitant α-synuclein (n = 38; 57%); the remaining had TDP (n = 9; 13%), FTLD-tau (n = 3; 4%), or negligible co-pathology (n = 17; 25%). Logistic regression showed that AD with α-synuclein was more likely to be NNfL− (β = −2.01, standard error [SE] = 0.84, p = 0.016) than ADpure. In addition, older AD patients were more likely to be NNfL+ (β = 0.11, SE = 0.04, P = .0081).

4 | DISCUSSION

The ATN framework aims to use biomarkers to identify AD pathology during life, and to distinguish AD from SNAP and controls. N status is critical to detecting SNAP, such as FTLD, especially when it co-occurs with AD. In patients with autopsy-confirmed AD and FTLD, we compared ATN strategies using CSF t-tau as a traditional marker of N (ATNTAU) and CSF NfL as an alternative marker of N (ATNNfL). ATNNfL was highly accurate for detecting both AD and FTLD primary pathology, even in the context of co-pathology, classifying 94% of AD patients as “Alzheimer’s continuum disease” and 93% of FTLD patients with SNAP. When classifying FTLD as SNAP, ATNNfL was more accurate than ATNTAU (44%), which had poor performance and classified a large percentage of FTLD as “normal” (41% A−T−NTAU−) or “Alzheimer’s pathologic change” (15% A+T−NTAU−). As found previously,31,46,47 we observed higher NfL in FTLD than AD autopsy patients. In addition, sex was a significant factor for t-tau concentrations,48 while age21 and MMSE22 were significant factors for NfL.

A potential strength of the ATN framework is its intention to identify cases with SNAP or “concomitant Alzheimer’s and SNAP,” providing a more detailed in vivo diagnosis beyond traditional binary stratification by individual AD biomarkers or ratios (ie, AD or non-AD). This is an important issue because co-occurring proteinopathies are common,6,49 and cases with secondary AD pathology are likely to have positive AD biomarkers,5,13 obscuring the presence of the primary non-AD pathology. Indeed, FTLD-specific biomarkers are lacking and thus, AD biomarker positivity does not preclude a diagnosis of non-AD neurodegenerative disease. Such misclassifications can increase noise in clinical treatment trials, because cases with mixed pathology might be less responsive to AD-specific pharmacological targets. Our results indicate that ATNNfL was highly sensitive to FTLD pathology, whether it was primary or secondary pathology. We found that all three AD with co-occurring FTLD-tau were NNfL+. In addition, CSF Aβ1–42 misclassified four FTLDpure cases as A+, despite little AD pathology detected at autopsy (ADNC low or not). Of these, 100% were misdiagnosed by ATNTAU as early “Alzheimer’s pathologic change” (A+T−N−), missing the primary pathology of FTLD, while ATNNfL classified all four A+FTLD cases as “concomitant Alzheimer’s and SNAP” (A+T−NNfL+). This is a very small number of cases, so we can only modestly speculate about a more generalized application of this finding. Still, FTLD may be well captured by ATNNfL designations of “SNAP” or “concomitant Alzheimer’s and SNAP,” indicating that NfL in the context of ATN may help inform diagnostic decisions.

While both N metrics were elevated in familial patients compared with controls in our training sample, the effect size was larger for NfL, explaining in part the high accuracy of ATNNfL when identifying FTLD as SNAP in autopsy patients. Notably, our sample-specific cut-point for t-tau (51.5 pg/mL) was lower than the previously published cut-point established in AD (93 pg/mL;39 specificity = 0.92, sensitivity = 0.70). We have previously demonstrated that the cut-point of t-tau &gt;93 pg/mL is not sensitive to FTLD, and erroneously classifies a large majority of FTLD as “normal.”5 While the lower cut-point in this study improved the classification of FTLD as SNAP and classified more AD patients as N+, the lower specificity (0.73) would likely produce many false-positives in healthy controls. By comparison, NfL was nearly perfect when discriminating fFTLD from cognitively unimpaired controls (sensitivity = 1, specificity = 0.95). Examining biomarkers individually, NfL was no more accurate discriminating FTLD from AD (AUC = 0.87) than traditional Aβ1–42 (AUC = 0.96) and p-tau (AUC = 0.94), which consistently show excellent discrimination of AD.10,11 Our results indicate that combining biomarkers that are sensitive to AD pathologic hallmarks (Aβ1–42 and p-tau) with markers sensitive to neurodegeneration in FTLD (NfL), ATNNfL is able to successfully discriminate AD continuum from SNAP, and to identify primary pathology accurately even in the context of mixed pathology.

In addition to the role of NNfL status in detecting FTLD as SNAP, we investigated the interpretation of NNfL status in AD. While higher NfL concentrations are found in FTLD diseases,31,46,47 previous work indicates NfL is a promising prognostic indicator of disease severity and survival in AD.21–23 A study comparing plasma NfL levels by ATNTAU profiles found elevated plasma NfL in tau-positive groups (T+ and/or N+) compared to tau-negative, suggesting that plasma NfL may be higher in clinically diagnosed AD patients with more severe disease,50 although the presence of co-pathology in this non-autopsy cohort is unclear. However, a limitation to NNfL as a marker of disease severity in AD may be the somewhat lower proportion of NNfL+ AD cases we observed (52%) compared to NTAU (91%), a finding also seen by another study that tested ATNNfL.4 A second observation in AD was that co-occurring α-synuclein pathology was highly common and was associated with NNfL− status. Thus as biomarkers for α-synuclein are developed, they should be tested in AD and Lewy body disorders in the context of ATNNfL to improve interpretation and capture commonly co-occurring AD and α-synuclein.

We do note important limitations to ATNNfL. In terms of likely errors, ATNNfL classified two patients as “normal” (0 AD; 2 FTLD). While NfL was sensitive to primary FTLD, a minority of ADmixed cases were NNfL+ (see supporting information; 33%). Designation of ADmixed as “concomitant Alzheimer’s and SNAP” (A+T−NNfL+) was low (14%), and equivalent to AD with negligible co-pathology (12%). This highlights an important caveat: we do not expect NNfL to be equally sensitive to all forms of SNAP, some of which (eg, α-synuclein) may be associated with relatively low concentrations of NfL.19,31 Our results indicate that AD patients with secondary pathologies like α-synuclein, LATE, or hippocampal sclerosis are not more likely to be NNfL+ than ADpure. Thus, while CSF NfL well identifies FTLD as SNAP, it does not appear to be sensitive to all forms of SNAP. Conversely, NNfL+ status may not be specific to FTLD, and other diseases with severe axonal damage, including vascular forms of dementia, are likely to have elevated CSF NfL.19,21 Thus, interpretation of ATNNfL status may require consideration of other diagnostic hallmarks, such as the presence of parkinsonian motor features, FTLD-associated clinical features, or white matter hyperintensities on neuroimaging. As informative biomarkers are developed for additional conditions, these may be combined with ATNNfL to provide more accurate and specific diagnoses within a heterogeneous population.

There are additional caveats to our findings. First, this was a retrospective study with limited data availability and we were unable to compare CSF t-tau and NfL to imaging markers of N.51–53 Second, while a strength of this study was the use of an independent sample with known pathology to determine cut-points for NTAU and NNfL status, fAD is rare29,30 and only five fAD were available; additional AD cases in the training set might have improved classification of AD autopsy patients for t-tau or NfL. Third, these findings must be validated in a large, well-defined autopsy-series that includes analysis of secondary pathologies, such as LATE and hippocampal sclerosis. While the current study focused on detection of FTLD as SNAP, future investigations should include additional forms of SNAP, such as Lewy body disorders and vascular forms of dementia, to better define the potential scope of ATNNfL. Finally, we cannot be certain of the pathological status of autopsy patients at the time that CSF was obtained, and it could be that some cases were true negatives for neurodegeneration at CSF collection. To account for this confound, we included only symptomatic patients in analyses. While we assume that most symptomatic patients are positive for neurodegeneration (N+),54 this cannot be confirmed, and with no standardized method to compare severity of neurodegeneration across a heterogeneous population, we are unable to assess how N status in AD and FTLD relates to severity of degeneration.

In summary, we find that NfL is a useful marker of N that is highly sensitive to FTLD pathology; critically, this is true even in cases with concomitant AD pathology. ATNNfL had excellent classification performance, correctly identifying 94% of AD patients as AD continuum disease and 93% of FTLD patients as SNAP. These results indicate NfL in the context of ATN may help inform diagnostic decisions.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: Scientific literature was reviewed using Google Scholar. ATN successfully stratifies Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from healthy controls, but may not well discriminate other forms of neurodegeneration, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Modified strategies of ATN have been previously tested, including ATN using CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL), but these studies test ATN’s ability to predict clinical outcomes in subjects without known pathology. Evaluations of diagnostic accuracy in pathologically-confirmed samples are needed.

Interpretation: In autopsy-confirmed AD and FTLD, ATN using CSF NfL is more accurate than traditional CSF total tau at diagnosing FTLD as suspected non-Alzheimer’s pathology (SNAP).

Future directions: By detecting FTLD as SNAP, even when it co-occurs with AD, we might better define inclusion criteria for treatment trials and control pre-analytical factors. Findings highlight the need for biomarkers that are specific to non-AD proteinopathies, and future studies should investigate strategies to detect other forms of SNAP, including α-synuclein.
