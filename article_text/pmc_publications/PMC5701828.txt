OBJECTIVES

To survey the current methods used to ascertain dementia and MCI in longitudinal cohort studies, in order to categorize differences in approaches and to identify key components of expert panel methodology in current use.

METHODS

We searched PubMed for the past 10 years, from March 6, 2007–March 6, 2017 using a combination of controlled vocabulary and keyword terms to identify expert panel consensus methods used to diagnose MCI or dementia in large cohort studies written in English. From these results, we identified a framework for reporting standards, and describe as an exemplar the clinical consensus procedure used in an ongoing study of elective surgery patients (the Successful AGing after Elective Surgery study).

RESULTS

Thirty-one articles representing unique cohorts were included. Among published methods, membership of experts panel varied significantly. There was more similarity in what types of information was use to ascertain disease status. However, information describing the diagnostic decision process and resolution of disagreements was often lacking.

CONCLUSION

Methods used for expert panel diagnosis of MCI and dementia in large cohort studies are widely variable, and there is a need for more standardized reporting of these approaches. By describing the procedure in which our expert panel achieved consensus diagnoses, we hope to encourage the development and publication of well-founded and reproducible methods for diagnosis of MCI and dementia in longitudinal studies.

Introduction

In longitudinal studies of aging, tracking progression of cognitive changes over time often requires detection of the onset of clinically significant mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. The reference standard diagnosis of MCI or dementia requires direct evaluation by a clinician, integrating information obtained through history from patient and family members, physical examination, laboratory testing, and neuroimaging, to determine if the findings meet established clinical criteria – such as the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria for all-cause dementia,1 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) criteria for major neurocognitive disorders.2 However, in large epidemiologic or cohort studies, this approach may not be feasible due to expense and/or logistical constraints. An alternative method utilizes expert panels for diagnosing MCI or dementia in cohort studies. However, there is currently no standardized approach and limited evidence on preferred methodology.3

For our own large-scale, prospective epidemiologic study of cognitive outcomes following major surgery, we wanted to implement rigorous methods for a clinical consensus procedure for cognitive outcomes following accepted approaches by expert panels. Thus, we first conducted a systematic literature review on expert panel consensus diagnosis methods for MCI and dementia used in cohort studies to provide detailed information on each of the approaches, and to identify key components of the expert panel methodology. Next, we provide a description of the clinical consensus procedure we developed for the Successful AGing after Elective Surgery Study (SAGES),4 and describe its alignment with and extension of the other approaches. Finally, based on lessons learned, suggested reporting standards are presented.

Materials and Methods

Literature Review

A systematic literature review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines.5,6 To identify relevant papers on the expert panel diagnosis of MCI or dementia, a PubMed search using the search strategy ([dementia] AND [diagnosis] AND ([expert panel] OR [consensus methods] OR [consensus diagnosis])) was performed by one of the authors (TGF). The search was limited to papers published in the past 10 years (March 6, 2007–March 6, 2017), in human subjects, and written in English. Studies were required to be original investigations that included diagnosis of MCI or dementia as an outcome measure, for example, cohort studies of dementia prevalence or incidence. We specifically excluded studies where a clinical diagnosis of MCI or Alzheimer’s disease was supported by biomarkers, such as in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) or Australian Imaging, Biomarker &amp; Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) studies7, or studies which use pathologic results from autopsy to confirm diagnoses, such as in the Nun study8 or the Rush Religious Orders Study.9 In addition, we excluded review articles, papers that described consensus guidelines intended for diagnostic use in clinical practice, letters, and case reports (Figure 1).

We identified a total of 1168 articles. After exclusion of articles based on title and abstract (Figure 1), 56 remaining full-text articles were reviewed. It is important to note that the overall goal of this review was to identify varying approaches to consensus methods, not to provide an exhaustive review of all studies of incident dementia. In addition, following Institute of Medicine (IOM) standards for systematic reviews,10 three articles describing the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and Honolulu Asian-American Study (HAAS) cohort, were added based on hand-review of references, since these cohorts are frequently referenced by other studies and are considered to be important among longitudinal studies on aging.

Information on the consensus method for diagnosing MCI or dementia was abstracted for each study by one of three study authors (EYK, EM, TTH) into a table capturing key categories of interest. Data were confirmed and cross-checked by another author for inclusion in the table (TGF). For several papers identified by the literature search, details on the expert panel methods were obtained from or verified with additional articles, since some papers were follow-up analyses of long-standing longitudinal studies, with more detailed methods having been published earlier.

Results

Systematic Review

We categorized expert panel methods in 31 studies (Table 1) in detail. Specifically, we examined the composition of the expert panel, the information available to the panel, and the decision process. For the decision process, we examined who performed the initial review, which criteria were used and how they were applied, and how disagreements were handled. Variability in the detail of the consensus methods was notable, with the number or expertise of the panel members not defined in nearly half of the studies (15/31, 48%). For those studies reporting such details, the number of panel members ranged from 2 to 7. A third of studies with panel descriptions explicitly included 5 or more experts (5/15, 33%). Around half of the studies (15/31, 48%) noted the composition of their expert panels, typically one or more members from the following disciplines: neurology, geriatric medicine, neuropsychology, geriatric psychiatry, nursing, gerontology, or neuroscience. All studies included cognitive or neuropsychological testing data for panel review. However, other measures were not universally included; for example, functional measures were included in 87% (27/31), proxy measures in 93% (28/31), and direct patient assessments in 77% (24/31).

The decision process used by each expert panel was variably reported. Once a case was brought to the panel, the initial evaluation was performed individually in 21 (68%) studies, by the entire group in 3 (10%) studies, or not specified in 5 (16%) studies. Most panels (22/31, 71%), relied on published diagnostic criteria, for example Diagnosis and Statistical Manual – version 5 (DSM-5),2 National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA),11 or National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer’s Association Diagnostic Guidelines (NIA-AA),1 but some studies used their own definitions. Specific details on how diagnostic criteria were met by the available data were not provided in most cases. The decision process was specified as “majority vote” or “consensus” in 21 of 31 studies reviewed (70%), but few studies provided specific criteria required to achieve consensus. Furthermore, handling of disagreements was not well described, with only 6 of 31 studies (20%) reporting methods used to reach a final decision. One exception to this is in WHIMS, which provides a useful example reporting details of their consensus approach. The authors specifically describe how 2 adjudicators independently evaluated the data and assigned a classification, which was then matched with the diagnostic classification made by a field physician; all 3 adjudicators needed to be in agreement for consensus diagnosis. If the adjudicators disagreed, they discussed the case and if consensus was still not achieved, the 3 adjudicators plus a geriatric psychologist familiar with the neuropsychological measures discussed the case until a consensus was reached.12

Clinical Consensus Procedure for the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery (SAGES) Study

SAGES is an ongoing prospective cohort study of older adults undergoing major elective non-cardiac surgery, which examines the contribution of delirium to long-term outcomes, including cognitive decline. Incident dementia or mild cognitive impairment are secondary outcome measures. The study design and methods have been described previously.4 The expert panel procedure for classification of MCI or dementia is summarized in Table 2. In brief, a seven-member interdisciplinary expert panel chaired and coordinated by a non-voting neurologist (TGF) reviewed detailed demographic and clinical data, which provided a framework for interpreting the cognitive, functional, and proxy-rated outcome measures. Keeping these factors in mind, the next step in the individual diagnostic procedure was to review specific data that was used to score the NIA-AA criteria.1 These criteria provided a conceptual “checklist” for establishing a research diagnosis of dementia or MCI (eTable 1). In the case of dementia, for example, the NIA-AA requirement for a symptom “that interferes with usual activities, is a decline from a prior level of functioning, and is not explained by delirium or other psychiatric factor” to be present was evaluated by review of the following data: impairment in memory or other cognitive patient-reported Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) (disruption in usual activities), proxy Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) (decline from a prior level of functioning), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (presence or absence of delirium), and Short Form-12/Geriatric Depression Scale (presence or absence of other psychiatric factor). For evidence of cognitive decline, the expert panel chose to focus the adjudication process on selected neuropsychological tests that represented domains largely affected by MCI and dementia diagnosis, including the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Discrimination Index (HVLT-DI) and HVLT-Percent Retention, Boston Naming Test (BNT) category fluency, and Trails B. Cut points for MCI were defined as impairment more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below mean (age-adjusted norm) on HVLT-DI or percent retention, or impairment more than 1.5 SD below mean (age-adjusted norm) on two or more of the selected tests.13,14 For dementia, cognitive performance had to be more than 2 SD below mean (age-adjusted norm) on two or more of the selected tests.15,16 When longitudinal data was available, trends over time were considered in diagnosis.

After completing initial individual review for each case, panel members entered their preliminary diagnoses and any comments about the case to assist adjudication into a centralized database developed in REDCap.17 Panel members were advised to consider factors that could potentially affect cognitive performance, such as the presence of a delirium, depression, anxiety, medications, vision/hearing impairment, medical co-morbidities, and developmental disabilities. Table 2 provides details of the SAGES clinical consensus protocol, which included a modified Delphi consensus process,18 along with the number of patients undergoing each step. The SAGES procedure is summarized and compared descriptively with other studies from the systematic review (Table 3).

Discussion

Methods to identify incident dementia and related cognitive disorders are crucial for many large-scale longitudinal studies, which aim to enhance our understanding of the cognitive aging process. The ability to compare and reproduce methods across studies is important to enhance and speed the advancement of scientific understanding in this important area. In our systematic review, we have demonstrated that the methods and the level of detail in reporting of the methods are highly variable across studies. The variability in approaches combined with inconsistency in reporting makes comparison of findings across studies quite challenging. Moreover, since none of the reported methods in this review have been validated against a reference standard, such as cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer’s biomarkers, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, or pathological confirmation, comparison of the relative diagnostic efficacy of these approaches was beyond the scope of the present study.

Some of the studies from the systematic review used a two stage approach, where the first stage utilized a brief cognitive screen on all study participants, followed by a clinical examination by skilled clinicians (often neurologists) of those participants who show evidence of cognitive impairment by the screen. Inclusion of a clinical examination, however, also does not guarantee accuracy of a diagnosis, and for many large cohort studies, direct clinical assessments are not always feasible. For these reasons, large cohort studies often apply epidemiologic tools and an expert panel to approximate a clinical diagnosis because using multiple pieces of information can improve classification of the presence or absence of the disease 3. Our review indicates that these methods are often highly variable, and to date no minimum standards have been established for reporting 19.

Based on our findings and prior work,3 we have proposed some summary recommendations for reporting of expert consensus procedures (Table 4) across 4 domains: expert panel constitution; data provided to panel; decision process; and validity of diagnosis. In terms of the panel constitution, Bertens et al3 have recommended assuring the same panel members throughout the study, using an odd number of members if voting is part of the process (to avoid ties), and defining how panels will resolve disagreements prior to initiating the study. We recommend including members from 4 expert disciplines if possible – neurology, geriatrics, psychiatry, and neuropsychology – to cover the breadth of the clinical expertise for optimal evaluation of the study data. Ensuring diversity of expertise among panel members improves accuracy of the modified Delphi approach, compared with ratings of a single clinician.20 Neuropsychologists are especially helpful to assist in interpreting the neuropsychological testing data, which can be extremely useful in complex cases. The inclusion of a non-voting coordinator for the process can help to minimize bias in results. In terms of data provided to the panel, well organized, clearly formatted reports providing all relevant demographic, background, clinical, and proxy-rated information to the panel along with embedded instructions maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. For neuropsychological testing, provision of both raw and adjusted scores, along with population norms, can greatly assist in interpretation.

Criteria for entering the adjudication process and for review by the full panel should be pre-specified for the decision process. As a first step, a blinded review by individual panel members is recommended. When full consensus is not achieved, then the case goes to second stage review by the full panel. Panel members utilize pre-specified decision rules to classify diagnoses. Clinical judgment is required to consider the influence of factors such as comorbidity, low educational level, or developmental disabilities; and to thoughtfully evaluate cognitive performance without relying solely on cut-points. Establishing the rules for handling disagreements and to achieve consensus should be completed á priori. The diagnostic accuracy for this approach, a modified Delphi method--which requires expert panels to first individually review a uniform set of data, followed by a group discussion and final group decision--has been shown to be superior to individual diagnosis, and is considered to provide sufficiently accurate diagnoses in cases where histopathological data are not available.17

Enhancing the validity of diagnoses can be achieved through the following steps. Use of accepted, published diagnostic criteria (e.g., NIA-AA criteria) maximizes accuracy, and evaluation of inter-rater agreement across panel members in the blinded ratings enhances reliability and reproducibility of diagnoses. Diagnoses can be further supported by longitudinal trends and clinical data (e.g., neuroimaging). True validation requires comparison with a reference standard, such as cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer’s biomarkers, amyloid PET imaging, or pathological confirmation.

In creating the SAGES clinical consensus procedure, we incorporated as many of these features (Table 4) as possible. The SAGES clinical consensus procedure was a structured and iterative diagnostic process, first undertaken individually by the seven members of the panel, and subsequently affirmed by group consensus adjudication using a modified Delphi method.18 This process takes advantage of a large panel with an odd-number of members, which provides a wider range of experience and expertise in approaching the data, particularly when the diagnosis may not be straightforward. As with other studies, SAGES uses published criteria for diagnosis, and the data available to our expert panel is explicitly aligned to address each component of the criteria (eTable 1), which is a strength of our process. Finally, the SAGES adjudication process facilitates consideration of other important factors such as developmental disability, comorbidity, or delirium. Although our SAGES method is not validated against a reference standard, it provides a means to approximate the NIA-AA criteria in an epidemiologic study.

Several caveats about this study are worthy of mention. First, as with any systematic review, some articles may have been missed. For a review of study methods, as opposed to study results, a particular challenge is in the ability of the search to identify studies, when specific details of the methods are not always part of the title, abstract or keywords. While we acknowledge this important limitation, it is unlikely that we missed a large number of additional methodologies that would differ substantially from the 31 approaches identified in the current review3,6. In addition, while we present SAGES as a representative example, it is not a validated approach. We did not intend for it to serve as a reference standard for these methods, only to provide a useful framework to demonstrate more detailed reporting of key steps in the expert panel process.

Conclusion

Methods used for expert panel diagnosis of MCI/dementia in large cohort studies are highly variable and often poorly described. Based on the studies reviewed here, the description of the expert panel methods should include at minimum both the number and expertise of the panel members, data available to the panel, definition of how established criteria are met, and details of the diagnostic decision making process, including the handling of disagreements. By describing the procedure in which our SAGES expert panel achieved consensus diagnoses, we hope to encourage development and publication of well-described and reproducible methods for the diagnosis of incident MCI/dementia in clinical and epidemiologic studies.
