Heterogeneity of subtle functional difficulties in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains poorly understood. We characterized patterns of informant reports of functional abilities among participants with MCI and the relation between functional ability pattern and cognitive abilities and subsequent decline. Data from 4,273 MCI participants from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS) were included in latent profile analyses (LPA) of informant responses on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Profiles from the best fitting model were compared on demographic, clinical, and cognitive variables. The best fitting model supported three profiles varying by level and type of difficulty: intact function (n=3,299), intermediate (n=769), and high ratings of difficulty (n=205). For the Intermediate profile, items related to finances, remembering dates, and travel were rated as most difficult. The High Ratings profile also had elevated ratings on the meal preparation item. Participants with either the Intermediate or High Ratings profile demonstrated a three-fold increase in conversion to dementia as compared to participants with the Intact profile. Demographically, the Intact profile was younger and consisted of a higher proportion of minorities. On cognitive tests, the Intact profile showed the best performance, and the Intermediate profile performed comparably to or better than the High Ratings profile. There is meaningful heterogeneity in informant ratings of function in MCI, though individuals with MCI whose informants report even intermediate-level functional difficulties are more likely to progress to dementia, suggesting that even subtle functional difficulties place individuals at higher risk for future decline.

Difficulties in completing activities of daily life, such as cooking a meal and managing medications, have consistently been considered a core diagnostic criterion for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but there has been less clarity regarding functional difficulties in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an earlier stage in the neurodegenerative disease process [1,2]. Early diagnostic criteria for MCI distinguished the condition from dementia in part by requiring individuals with MCI to have intact functional abilities [3]. However, later empirical data demonstrated that functional difficulties are indeed present at the MCI stage [e.g., 4–8], necessitating that updated diagnostic criteria allow for the presence of mild difficulties as long as “functional independence” is maintained [1]. It is now acknowledged that similar to cognitive abilities, problems with functional activities start with subtle problems and decline gradually to the point when older adults lose their autonomy [1,9–11]. These subtle changes have been found to predict conversion from MCI to dementia and even from normal aging to MCI [5,12,13]. As IADL impairment is an important early indicator of future cognitive decline, it is critical for research to go beyond quantifying functional difficulties in MCI relative to dementia and healthy cognition and begin to understand and characterize subtle changes in everyday functioning at the stage of MCI.

Two neuropsychological theories been proposed to explain IADL impairment in dementia but have not been explicitly evaluated in people with MCI. The resource theory posits that everyday performance of IADL requires attentional resources for the smooth execution of the multiple cognitive processes involved in everyday tasks [14–17]. Decline in IADLs is thus best explained as a decline in global cognitive status, irrespective of the type of cognitive abilities (e.g., executive functioning, episodic memory) impaired. This theory suggests heterogeneity in functional difficulties is largely observed in the level of impairment and accounts for the observation that as dementia severity increases, cognitive performance declines and ability to complete activities of daily living grows more impaired. When considering individuals with a similar overall level of cognitive impairment, this theory predicts that the pattern of error types committed during performance-based measures of everyday functioning is uniform, differing only in severity of impairment in accordance with overall level of cognitive functioning.

However, later studies revealed qualitative heterogeneity in patterns of errors in everyday functioning. In studies using performance-based measures of everyday functioning, dissociations are observed between individuals exhibiting a pattern of errors characterized by omissions of critical task steps or by commission errors (i.e., performing task steps incorrectly, such as using the wrong tool or repeating an already completed task step) [18]. Furthermore, these differing patterns of errors are associated with differing cognitive processes. For example, individuals with subcortical vascular dementia and individuals with dementia due to Parkinson’s disease, who showed impaired executive functioning but relatively spared episodic and semantic memory, commit a higher rate of commission errors, while individuals with Alzheimer’s dementia, who display the reverse pattern of cognitive impairment, commit more omission errors [18]. This dissociation was observed despite the groups having the same overall level of cognitive performance. Further work has shown that specific cognitive impairments in episodic memory and semantic memory and temporal lobe volumes are associated with errors of omission on IADL. By contrast, impairment on tests of executive function and white matter volumes are associated with errors of commission [19]. These studies and others [20–22] have contributed to the Omission-Commission Model of functional disability. This model posits that omission errors are caused by episodic memory deficits, as individuals are unable to recall the correct task steps, whereas commission errors result from problems with planning and organization because of executive functioning deficits. Importantly, the Omission-Commission Model has implications for intervention, as a recent study showed reminder cues improved performance by reducing only omission errors and led to meaningful IADL performance only among participants with an “omissive” pattern of performance errors [23].

Although not directly tested in MCI, there is some support for both the resource theory and the omission-commission model. Reports that individuals with multi-domain MCI demonstrate greater functional difficulties than individuals with other types of MCI generally support the resource theory [24,25]. Although there is no evidence that individuals with different MCI subtypes demonstrate distinct error patterns on IADL, individuals with different MCI subtypes have been shown to differ in their ability to perform different IADL tasks. For example, Bangen and colleagues (2010) found that amnestic MCI participants were impaired on a performance-based measure of financial ability, whereas non-amnestic MCI participants were impaired on measures relating to health and safety [26]. Additionally, Kim and colleagues (2009) found that, on self-report measures of everyday function, individuals with different MCI subtypes differed on the items for which they reported poorer functioning compared to controls [27]. Non-amnestic single domain participants were impaired on items relating to using the telephone and using household appliances, whereas amnestic multiple-domain participants were impaired on items relating to using the telephone, using transportation, and managing finances. These results suggest that different IADLs may be differentially reliant upon specific cognitive processes, and thus individuals with differing patterns of cognitive performance may differ accordingly in their pattern of functional performance. If true, then this heterogeneity would have implications for intervention and prevention strategies to promote IADL among people with MCI.

The primary goal of the present study was to characterize the heterogeneity of IADL abilities in older adults with MCI on a widely used informant-report measure, the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [28], using a person-centered statistical approach (i.e., latent profile analysis; LPA). In contrast to variable-centered statistical approaches, such as regression, which examine the relationship of variables of interest to each other (e.g., functional abilities, cognitive abilities), person-centered approaches examine how variables combine across individuals and may be useful in identifying subgroups with similar functional profiles within a larger, heterogeneous sample [29–31]. In accordance with this goal, we hypothesized that we would observe both quantitative (i.e., level of difficulty in performance) and qualitative (i.e., patterns of items endorsing difficulty) differences in patterns of functional performance. Based on past work by Bangen and colleagues (2010) and Kim and colleagues (2009) [26,27], we hypothesized that subgroups revealed by the LPA would be related to MCI subtype. As a secondary goal, we sought to externally validate the identified groups by testing whether and to what extent profiles differed based on demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and domains of cognitive performance.

METHODS

Participants

Data were acquired from the publicly available National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database. The NACC consists of approximately 31 National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer’s disease centers (ADCs) from throughout the United States collecting a longitudinal, standardized protocol of clinical and neuropathological research data [32–34]. ADCs were overseen by their local Institutional Review Boards, and informed consent was obtained accordingly. Participants completed approximately yearly examinations by a trained clinician involving collection of a Uniform Data Set (UDS) [33], including information on demographics, medical history, clinical evaluations, functional assessment, and neuropsychological data. Diagnosis of MCI or AD was made by a clinician or consensus conference at each ADC [34–36]. Cognitively healthy participants are those without a diagnosis of MCI or dementia. Access to the NACC database is available to researchers at ADC and non-ADC institutions by request [32,33].

We utilized data up to the December 2016 data freeze, including data collected from September 2005 to December 2016. Participants were those classified as MCI at the initial UDS appointment. Inclusion criteria included native English speaker, at least 50 years old, and no doubts as to the reliability of the informant, which was determined by consensus of staff who interacted with the informant. Individuals with diagnosed neurological conditions, including history or presence of stroke, Parkinson’s disease, traumatic brain injury, seizures, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, primary progressive aphasia, frontotemporal dementia, Down’s syndrome, or central nervous system neoplasm were excluded. Sample characteristics are described in Table 1. Study participants completed an average of 3.20 yearly visits (SD = 2.29; range 1–11 visits).

Everyday Functioning

The ability to independently perform instrumental activities of daily life (IADLs) was evaluated with the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [28], an informant questionnaire that is frequently used for older adults in both clinical and research settings. The FAQ consists of 10 items evaluating the following skills: (1) writing checks, balancing a checkbook, and paying bills; (2) organizing tax, business, and insurance papers; (3) shopping for clothes, household goods, and groceries; (4) playing a game of skill such as chess or bridge or working on a hobby; (5) heating water for coffee/tea and turning off the stove; (6) preparing a meal; (7) following current events; (8) understanding a TV show, book, or magazine; (9) remembering appointments, family events, and medications; and (10) planning travel away from the home by car or bus. Each item is rated as follows: 0 (can complete independently), 1 (has difficulty but performs task independently), 2 (requires assistance), or 3 (completely dependent upon a caregiver) [28]. The NACC dataset additionally allows responses of “never did” or “not applicable;” these responses were coded as missing in the present study. The FAQ has good validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specificity [28,37–39]. The FAQ was administered to an informant as part of the UDS at each annual visit [34–36]. Informant-ratings on the FAQ for participants diagnosed as MCI at the initial visit were used for this study. Mean overall and item ratings for the sample are depicted in Table 2.

Demographic Variables

The following demographic variables were obtained at the time the FAQ was completed: age (in years), number of years of education completed, sex (man, woman), race (White, non-White), living situation (i.e., whether the co-participant lives with the participant: yes, no), and primary reason for presenting to the ADC (to have a clinical evaluation, participation in a research study, both or another reason). The reason for participation variable was dichotomized to indicate whether the participant was motivated to receive a clinical assessment (i.e., clinical exam OR both research and clinical exam v. participating in a research study).

Clinical Variables

The following clinical variables were obtained at the time the FAQ was completed: depression (total score on the Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS [40]) and MCI subtype (single domain amnestic, multiple domain amnestic, single domain non-amnestic, multiple domain non-amnestic). The incident dementia variable identified whether the participant was diagnosed with dementia at any follow-up visit during study participation.

Cognitive Variables

Cognitive tests of global cognitive status, episodic memory, executive functions, and processing speed were examined, because these cognitive abilities are known to be affected in aging and MCI and have been associated with everyday functional abilities in past research (e.g., [18,41,42]. A description of the neuropsychological tests and the dependent variables used for the present study are shown in Table 3.

Statistical Analyses

To investigate the primary aim of this study, a latent profile analysis (LPA) was performed using the FAQ informant data in Mplus version 7.4 [43]. LPA yields relatively homogeneous sub-groups that for the present study could be based on types of activities impaired, level of impairment within activities, or both from a heterogeneous sample [29–31]. LPA has advantages over related classification approaches, such as cluster analysis and k-means clustering, in that it uses model-based, probabilistic classification and provides statistical fit indices to guide selection of the best-fitting model; additionally, LPA can accommodate predictor and outcome variables of differing scales and variances [30,31,44–46]. LPA assumes that latent profiles are homogenous and that relationships between variables are due to the underlying latent profile [44]; other common statistical assumptions such as normality are not required.

LPA modeling starts by specifying one profile, then adding one profile at a time until there is no further improvement in the fit of the model [30,31]. To determine the best fitting model, multiple statistical fit indices are examined, including the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [47], Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [48], and sample-size adjusted BIC (ABIC) [49]. Lower scores on these indices suggest better model fit. We also considered the Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT), which examines the fit of the model with k profiles to the fit with k – 1 profiles [30,31]. Entropy, an index of how well participants fit into profiles, was also considered. The size of the smallest profile was also considered; profiles that are too small (e.g., &lt; 5%−10% of the sample) suggest overfitting of the model to the data, which could limit generalizability. Last, theoretical implications and consistency with conceptual models were also considered.

Following identification of profiles, tests of equality of means were conducted to determine whether and to what extent profiles differed in terms of demographic features, clinical variables, and cognitive abilities. The test of equality of means holds sub-group membership constant and provides chi-square statistics for omnibus and pairwise comparisons across latent profiles. Pairwise comparisons were examined only if the omnibus tests were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected p value of .0083 for demographic variables, .0167 for clinical variables, and .0071 for cognitive variables. Pairwise comparisons were determined to be significant when p &lt;.05. Effect sizes were estimated using phi (φ; small = .1; medium = .3; large = .5)

Mplus uses listwise deletion in these auxiliary analyses; however, full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation was used to address missing data in the LPA. FIML uses all available data to estimate model parameters but does not impute values. This approach allows for use of participants with missing data in model estimation and generates less error in parameter estimates and standard errors relative to other missing data strategies.

RESULTS

LPA was conducted with informant-ratings on the FAQ. A total of 4,302 participants met inclusion/exclusion criteria; however, 29 participants were missing informant ratings on all FAQ items and were thus not included in further analyses, leaving a total of 4,273 participants in the final analysis. A one profile model was fit first, followed by models with two, three, and four profiles (see Table 4). Guidelines for determining the best-fitting model suggest selecting the model that is conceptually coherent, with a statistically significant BLRT and the smallest BIC, AIC, and ABIC values [30]. Fit statistics are depicted in Table 4. Though the AIC, BIC, and ABIC were lowest for the four-profile model, there were statistical and theoretical reasons the three-profile model was identified to best reflect meaningfully different groups. First, the four-profile model included a sub-group consisting of two percent of the participants or less, which does not support the goodness of fit of this model. Second, comparison of the three- and four-profile models indicated that the fourth profile was not conceptually meaningful and likely better conceptualized as part of a larger profile that was represented in the three-profile model. We therefore selected the three-profile model as the model of best fit, as it led to decreases in AIC, BIC, and ABIC, as well as a significant BLRT, and identified profiles of sufficient size that are meaningfully distinct from each other.

Mean scores for each FAQ item by profile are shown in Figure 1. The first profile (Intact) consisted of 3,299 individuals whose informant-rated performance on the FAQ is relatively intact. Average FAQ score for an individual in this profile was 0.13. On average, none of the items were rated one (i.e., has difficulty) or greater. The item with the greatest elevation was related to memory (i.e., remembering appointments, family occasions, holidays, and medications), though the mean for this item was only 0.37 for individuals in this profile. The second profile (Intermediate Ratings), comprised of 769 participants, was characterized by an intermediate level of impairment ratings on the FAQ. Average FAQ score for an individual in this profile was 0.86. On average, four items were rated as one (i.e., has difficulty) or higher: paying bills, organizing tax and business papers, remembering appointments, and planning travel by car or bus. The third profile (High Ratings), consisting of 205 individuals, was characterized by the highest level of impairment ratings on the FAQ. Average FAQ score for an individual in this profile was 1.79. Only a single item, understanding a TV show, book, or magazine, had a mean rating of less than one (has difficulty). Additionally, the pattern of elevated items in the High Ratings profile differed from the pattern of four elevated items in the Intermediate Ratings profile. For the High profile, five items had the highest ratings among all profiles, with a mean greater than two (i.e., requires assistance): paying bills, organizing tax and business papers, shopping, meal preparation, and travel. The rating for remembering appointments was also elevated compared to the remaining items, with the average just below two. A unique feature of the High Ratings profile was that the average rating for meal preparation (M = 2.1- requires assistance) was as high as ratings for remembering appointments (M rating = 1.9 - requires assistance). By contrast, for the Intermediate Ratings profile, remembering appointments was rated higher (M = 1.2 - has difficulty) than meal preparation (M = .44).

Demographic Variables

Means, standard deviations, and omnibus between-group statistics for demographic variables are reported in Table 5. Follow-up pairwise comparisons indicated that the Intact profile was significantly younger than both the Intermediate Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 5.04, p = .03, φ = .04, and the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 10.08, p = .001, φ = .05. The age difference between the Intermediate Ratings and High Ratings profiles failed to reach significance, χ2 (1) = 3.35, p = .07, φ = .06, though the trend suggests an expected relation between increasing age and increasing impairment.

The Intact profile had a lower percentage of White participants than either the High Ratings, χ2 (1) = 15.34, p &lt; .001, φ = .07, or Intermediate Ratings, χ2 (1) = 30.87, p &lt; .001, φ = .09, profiles. The racial composition of the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles did not differ, χ2 (1) = 0.26, p = .61, φ = .021.

The Intact profile had a lower percentage of live-in informants than either the Intermediate, χ2 (1) = 16.05, p &lt; .001, φ = .06, or the High Ratings, χ2 (1) = 22.05, p &lt; .001, φ = .08, profile. The difference between the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles did not reach statistical significance, χ2 (1) = 3.47, p = .06, φ = .06.

The Intermediate profile differed from both the Intact and High Ratings profiles in terms of reason for presenting to the ADC, with the Intermediate profile having a greater proportion of individuals presenting for a clinical evaluation (Intermediate v. Intact: χ2 (1) = 31.43, p &lt; .001, φ = .09; Intermediate v. High Ratings: χ2 (1) = 4.09, p = .04, φ = .06). The Intact and High Ratings profiles did not differ in reasons for presenting to the study, χ2 (1) = 1.26, p = .26, φ = .02.

Clinical Variables

Means, standard deviations, and omnibus between-group statistics for clinical variables are reported in Table 6. The Intact profile exhibited fewer depressive symptoms than the High Ratings, χ2 (1) = 21.85, p &lt; .001, φ = .08, and the Intermediate Ratings, χ2 = 28.42, p &lt; .001, φ = .08, profiles. The difference in GDS scores between the High and Intermediate Ratings groups failed to reach significance, χ2 (1) = 3.13, p = .08, φ = .06.

Regarding rates of incident dementia, while only 26% of the Intact profile received a dementia diagnosis at a later visit during study participation, 54% of the Intermediate Ratings and 56% of the High Ratings profile were found to convert to dementia. These rates of incident dementia significantly differed between the Intact profile and Intermediate Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 147.01, p &lt; .001, φ = .19, and the Intact profile and the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 54.02, p &lt; .001, φ = .12. The High and Intermediate Ratings profiles did not differ, χ2 (1) = .27, p = .60, φ = .02. Odds of converting to dementia were 0.36 for the Intact profile, 1.15 for the Intermediate Ratings profile, and 1.28 for the High Ratings profile. In comparison to the Intact profile, the odds ratio for conversion to dementia for the Intermediate Ratings profile was 3.20 (95% CI, 2.72 – 3.76), while the odds ratio for conversion in the High Ratings profile was 3.56 (95% CI, 2.67 – 4.74). The odds ratio for incident dementia in comparing the High Ratings profile to the Intermediate Ratings profile was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.82 – 1.52).

Given these differences in incident dementia, we further examined profile-group differences in time to dementia onset and total number of yearly study visits completed. Time to dementia onset was calculated using the first yearly visit in which a participant was diagnosed with dementia. On average, participants in the Intact profile who progressed to dementia did so in 2.36 years (SD = .06) from the baseline study visit, in 1.66 years (SD = .06) in the Intermediate Ratings profile, and in 1.60 years (SD = .11) in the High Ratings profile. Omnibus tests indicated that the between-group mean differences were significant, χ2 (2) = 75.28, p &lt; .001, φ = .24. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the Intact profile took longer to progress to dementia than either the Intermediate Ratings, χ2 (1) = 64.27, p &lt; .001, φ = .23, or High Ratings, χ2 (1) = 34.72, p &lt; .001, φ = .19, profiles, whereas the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles did not differ, χ2 (1) = .20, p = .65, φ = .02. Additionally, the Intact profile completed the highest average number of follow-up visits (M = 3.25, SD = .04), followed by the Intermediate Ratings (M = 3.15, SD = .08) and High Ratings (M = 2.79, SD = .14) profiles. Omnibus tests indicated that these between-group differences were significant, χ2 (2) = 10.25, p = .006, φ = .05. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the High Ratings profile completed significantly fewer visits than the Intact, χ2 (1) = 9.67, p = .002, φ = .05, or Intermediate Ratings, χ2 (1) = 4.56, p = .03, φ = .07, profiles. The Intact and Intermediate profiles did not differ, χ2 (1) = 1.28, p = .26, φ = .02. These findings suggest that the higher rates of incident dementia in the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles cannot be accounted for by differences in number of follow-up visits or time to dementia. Along with higher rates on incident dementia in the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles, these two profiles progressed to dementia more quickly than the Intact profile and, in the case of the High Ratings group, completed a fewer number of study visits.

Cognitive Variables

Means, standard deviations, and omnibus between-group statistics for cognitive variables are reported in Table 7. Follow-up pairwise analyses for most tests (i.e., MMSE, digits backward, Trails A, WAIS Digit Symbol) showed that the Intact profile was less impaired than the Intermediate Ratings profile, which was less impaired than the High Ratings profile. Specifically, analyses for the MMSE scores indicated that the Intact profile was less impaired than either the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 48.35, p &lt; .001, φ = .13, or Intermediate Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 65.56, p &lt; .001, φ = .12, whereas the Intermediate Ratings profile was less impaired than the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 6.88, p = .009, φ = .09. On digits backward, the Intact profile performed better than the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 15.85, p &lt; .001, φ = .07, and Intermediate Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 7.32, p = .007, φ = .04, whereas the Intermediate Ratings profile performed better than the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 4.04, p = .04, φ = .07. On trails A, the Intact profile performed better than the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 33.20, p &lt; .001, φ = .10, and the Intermediate Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 32.55, p &lt; .001, φ = .09, and the Intermediate Ratings profile performed better than the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 6.57, p = .01, φ = .08. On the WAIS digit symbol task, all three profiles differed from each other. The Intact profile performed better than the High Ratings, χ2 (1) = 120.80, p &lt; .001, φ = .20, and Intermediate Ratings, χ2 (1) = 58.97, p &lt; .001, φ = .13, profile, whereas the Intermediate Ratings profile performed better than the High Ratings profile, χ2 (1) = 29.49, p &lt; .001, φ = .19.

Pairwise comparisons for delayed recall and Trails B showed the Intact group was less impaired than the other groups, but the Intermediate and High Ratings groups did not differ from each other. Specifically, the Intact profile performed better than the High and Intermediate Ratings profiles on delayed recall (Intact v. High: χ2 (1) = 48.80, p &lt; .001, φ = .13; Intact v. Intermediate: χ2 (1) = 72.08, p &lt; .001, φ = .14), whereas the High and Intermediate Ratings profiles did not differ, χ2 (1) = 1.82, p = .18, φ = .05. On trails B, the Intact profile performed better than the High Ratings, χ2 (1) = 27.10, p &lt; .001, φ = .09, and Intermediate Ratings, χ2 (1) = 43.79, p &lt; .001, φ = .11, profiles. The High and Intermediate Ratings profiles did not differ, χ2 (1) = 1.99, p = .16, φ = .05.

DISCUSSION

Informant ratings of performance of everyday activities in individuals with MCI can be classified according to the level of difficulty and the specific tasks that are affected. In the Intact profile, the mean rating for all FAQ items indicated intact performance on all everyday activities, with the highest elevations (suggesting the most difficulties) found on an item related to remembering dates and appointments. Most participants (77%) in this sample of individuals with MCI were placed in this profile. The Intermediate Ratings profile included elevated ratings of difficulty on remembering dates and appointments as well as three additional items: paying bills, organizing tax papers, and traveling outside the home. Mean ratings on these items indicated that participants required some assistance in completing these four items. The pattern of difficulties in the High Ratings profile included impairment (i.e., individuals were somewhat dependent on a caregiver) on the four FAQ items that were difficult for participants in the Intermediate profile: remembering dates, paying bills, organizing tax papers, and traveling outside the home. In addition, the High Ratings profile showed impairment on a fifth item pertaining to meal preparation.

Profiles identified by our LPA meaningfully differed in terms of demographic, clinical, and cognitive variables. Overall cognitive performance varied between the profiles in a predictable pattern, with the Intact profile exhibiting the highest level of performance and the High Ratings profile the worst performance, supporting the validity of the profiles identified in our analysis. Effect sizes for auxiliary variables were generally small; however, the present study was limited to a sample of individuals with MCI, which involves a restricted range of cognitive performance.

Perhaps most importantly, our analysis found that individuals in both the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles were more likely to progress to dementia than individuals in the Intact profile, with rates of conversion of approximately 25% in the Intact profile and greater than 50% in the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles. Our study adds to the robust body of literature on functional difficulties in MCI and the predictive utility of functional difficulties in identifying individuals at risk for further cognitive decline [e.g., 4–8]. Prior work by Nowrangi and colleagues [12] utilizing the NACC dataset found that higher informant ratings of everyday functioning on the FAQ are associated with conversion to MCI or dementia in healthy older adults [12]. Our study expands on this finding by showing that higher informant ratings on the FAQ are associated with conversion to dementia among older adults with MCI. Furthermore, our findings suggested little evidence for a simple linear relation between functional difficulties and risk for dementia, as greater risk was not observed in those with the most functional difficulties. Instead, the results indicate a threshold effect, such that even subtle functional difficulties increase risk for dementia.

Our results are consistent with past research noting that handling finances is one of the earliest domains of everyday functioning to decline in individuals who present with mild cognitive difficulties [8,26,50,51]. FAQ items related to finances were elevated in both the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles in our analysis. Both profiles also included elevated ratings on the item related to travel outside the home, which similar to financial tasks, is a complex task that may be more sensitive to subtle changes in cognitive functioning.

Qualitative differences in functional difficulties also were observed between the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles, with the High Ratings profile including elevated impairment on an item related to meal preparation without a corresponding increase in severity in other areas of everyday functioning, such as remembering appointments. This finding is consistent with a study by Schmitter-Edgecombe, Parsey, and Lamb [52] which found that difficulties in functioning related to daily home life distinguished individuals with dementia from those with MCI. This observation may also be related to the ease of adopting compensatory strategies within differing domains of everyday functioning. For example, difficulties in remembering appointments may be more effectively managed by adopting use of a day planner. Other everyday tasks, such meal preparation, may not lend themselves to straightforward compensatory strategies, or the compensatory strategies themselves may require a more intact level of cognitive ability. In support, individuals with MCI engage in more compensatory strategy use compared to healthy older adults and people with dementia [52].

In contrast to our expectations, we did not find differing patterns of difficulties on the FAQ according to MCI subtype, and the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles did not differ significantly on a measure of episodic memory or consistently on tests of executive control. These results were surprising given the importance of these cognitive processes to everyday functioning in dementia and they do not support the Omission-Commission Model of everyday functioning. It is important to note that ADCs utilize additional neuropsychological tests beyond those included in the NACC UDS to diagnose and classify MCI subtypes. Thus, it remains possible that Intermediate and High Ratings profiles may differ on measures of episodic memory and executive functioning that were not included in the publicly available NACC dataset. The profiles identified differed on overall level of cognitive impairment, as well as cognitive domains of interest (executive functioning, episodic memory, and processing speed), which is more consistent with the Resource Theory of everyday functioning. Further work is needed to map the observed heterogeneity of functional difficulties to cognitive abilities in people with MCI.

In contrast to past studies that supported the Omission-Commission Model and showed significant functional differences between MCI subtypes, the present study utilized an informant questionnaire to assess everyday functioning. Although questionnaires such as the FAQ assess an individual’s overall ability to complete a task, they fail to provide information regarding the specific difficulties an individual encounters while completing a task. For example, an individual may have difficulty completing a task because he or she fails to complete essential task steps or, alternatively, because he or she performs task steps incorrectly. The extent to which sensory, motor [53] or other non-cognitive challenges impeded everyday function also is not captured by the FAQ. As the FAQ only records only whether an individual can complete a task independently, with help, or not at all, this important information as to why an individual experiences difficulty completing a task is lacking. Previous studies supporting the Omission-Commission Model used performance-based measures of everyday functioning involving unique error-coding systems to identify patterns of errors reliant upon different cognitive processes and responsive to different behavioral interventions [20–22]. Future studies of the Omission-Commission model in MCI should incorporate performance-based measures, such as the Naturalistic Action Test (NAT; [54]), or specialized questionnaires/interviews that focus on the reasons for difficulty with everyday tasks (e.g., omission errors vs. commission errors) to inform interventions [55]. The limitations of standard questionnaires in assessing cognitive abilities, however, does not imply that questionnaires lack clinical utility. Questionnaires administered to a patient or caregiver in medical settings are an efficient and cost-effective way for clinicians to assess ADL and IADL functioning, which inform risk for dementia. Additionally, our results suggest that even mild functional difficulties should be taken seriously and that interventions to promote the smooth and accurate performance of financial tasks, ability to remembering dates, and travel outside of the home should be implemented early.

An unusual finding from the present study relates to some of the demographic and clinical variables, namely, the racial composition, living situations, and reason for study participation of individuals in the different profiles. Our analysis found that the Intact profile differed from both the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles in terms of racial composition, with the Intact profile consisting of a higher percentage of racial and ethnic minorities. This finding is unexpected given that minority groups have higher rates of dementia [56] and generally lower raw scores on traditional neuropsychological tests [57]. Importantly, the FAQ is an informant-based questionnaire, and thus reporting of functional difficulties depends upon a variety of informant variables as well as the participant’s objective functional performance. It is possible that older adults in minority groups are more integrated into the family system and are therefore better able to preserve social roles for a longer period of time. When responsibility for everyday tasks are shared among members of a household, minor changes in the distribution of responsibility may occur without rising to the level of awareness. Reporting of functional difficulties is also affected by cultural beliefs regarding age-related decline [58]. However, the sample in the present study was predominantly White. Future studies should continue to examine racial disparities in diverse samples to evaluate the generalizability of the present findings and determine whether, like cognitive test scores, informant report scores should be adjusted for demographic variables.

Additionally, the Intact profile consisted of a higher percentage of study informants who did not live with the participant, whereas the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles did not differ from each other in terms of informants living with the participant. It is possible that informants who do not live with the participant may be less familiar with their functioning, and consequently may underreport the level of functional difficulty. However, this hypothesis is contradicted by the finding that the Intact profile was less likely to progress to dementia at a follow-up visit. Second, individuals in the Intact profile may be less likely to live with an informant because they are functioning at a higher level. Alternatively stated, these individuals, because they can function independently, may be less likely to move in with a caregiver.

In contrast to the Intact and the High Ratings groups, the Intermediate group included more individuals who were seeking a clinical evaluation. This result is generally consistent with past work showing higher rates of conversion in clinic versus community samples. The finding that the most functionally impaired MCI subgroup was less likely to be seeking clinical evaluation suggests the possibility of diminished insight in this subgroup. However, we acknowledge that the classification of participants as “seeking a clinical evaluation” may include some individuals who were responding to a request by family/friends and not because of personal concern. Also, participants who were simply interested in participating in research may have been motivated by some concern regarding their abilities. Our result suggests that insight and reason for study participation in people with MCI are important factors to explore in future studies.

The strengths of the present study include its use of data from a large-scale, longitudinal dataset and person-centered analyses to expand on a body of literature that typically uses variable-centered statistical approaches to compare individuals with MCI to controls and/or people with dementia. Systematic examination of the heterogeneity of functional abilities in people with MCI and whether this heterogeneity is relevant to predicting future cognitive decline showed that individuals with MCI whose informants reported even minor difficulties with IADL were at higher risk for conversion to dementia, supporting the clinical utility of functional questionnaires in healthcare settings.

1 The analysis was repeated using the following categories: White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Asian, and Other. Results were similar: the omnibus analysis was significant for race, χ2 (10) = 52.19, p &lt; .001, φ = .11. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the Intact profile differed from the High Ratings profile, χ2 (5) = 26.11, p &lt; .001, φ = .09, and Intermediate Ratings profile, χ2 (5) = 33.74, p &lt; .001, φ = .09. The racial composition of the Intermediate and High Ratings profiles did not differ, χ2 (5) = 2.31, p = .80, φ = .05.
