Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) may provide information on pathophysiological changes associated with tau deposition in cognitively unimpaired older adults. In this study, the associations of posterior cingulate gyrus tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition on PET with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) metabolite ratios acquired from bilateral posterior cingulate gyri were investigated in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Participants (n = 40) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging underwent single-voxel sLASER 1H MRS from the posterior cingulate gyrus at 3 Tesla, 18F-flortaucipir and 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET. An increase in posterior cingulate gyrus tau deposition, but not elevated Aβ, was associated with lower N-acetylaspartate/total creatine (tCr) and glutamate (Glu)/tCr ratios, and a sex by tau interaction was observed in association with Glu/tCr. Higher tau levels in cognitively unimpaired older adults are associated with biomarkers of neural and synaptic injury even in the absence of cognitive impairment and these relationships appear to be stronger in women than in men.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common dementia pathology observed in older adults. Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles accumulate years and sometimes decades before AD dementia is diagnosed (Knopman et al., 2003; Price and Morris, 1999). The presence of AD pathology in cognitively unimpaired adults has been confirmed not only by autopsy studies (Knopman et al., 2003) but also in vivo by cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) (Fagan et al., 2009), tau (Johnson et al., 2016) and Aβ (Aizenstein et al., 2008) positron emission tomography (PET) studies. While the presence of AD pathologies in a proportion of the cognitively unimpaired older adults is confirmed, our understanding of the biological consequences of these pathologies in cognitively unimpaired older adults is limited.

Proton (1H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides non-invasive measurements of the alterations in brain biochemistry associated with early features of neurodegeneration (Kantarci et al., 2008; Rose et al., 1999), and potentially of tau-related pathology in early AD (Chen et al., 2019). The applications of 1H MRS in central nervous system disorders has been described (Oz et al., 2014). The commonly evaluated brain metabolites using conventional 1H MRS at 3 tesla (T) or lower field strength include the glial metabolite myoinositol (mIns) (Brand et al., 1993), neural health and viability metabolite N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) (Murray et al., 2014; Urenjak et al., 1993), glutamatergic metabolites glutamate (Glu) and glutamine (Gln) (Oz et al., 2014), and membrane integrity marker total choline (tCho = glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine) (Oz et al., 2014). The metabolite total creatine (tCr = phosphocreatine + creatine) is commonly used as an internal reference. Previous studies showed that Aβ deposition is associated with 1H MRS metabolite ratios from the posterior cingulate gyrus in cognitively unimpaired older adults (Nedelska et al., 2017; Voevodskaya et al., 2016). For example, a higher mIns/tCr ratio was associated with a higher Aβ load on PET imaging with 11C Pittsburgh compound B (henceforth, PiB) (Kantarci et al., 2011), increased Aβ accumulation over time (Nedelska et al., 2017), and decreased CSF Aβ42 (Voevodskaya et al., 2016). While correlation of Aβ pathology on in vivo PET imaging with 1H MRS metabolite ratios in cognitively unimpaired adults have been studied (Kantarci et al., 2011; Nedelska et al., 2017; Voevodskaya et al., 2016), less is known about the association of 1H MRS biomarkers with in vivo tau burden.

The relationship between 1H MRS metabolites and AD tau pathology was studied only with tau transgenic rodent models (Kim et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2011), antemortem 1H MRS, postmortem autopsy studies (Kantarci et al., 2008; Murray et al., 2014) or in vivo CSF biomarkers of tau which lack spatial specificity (e.g., total tau, phosphorylated tau) (Bittner et al., 2013). In a tau transgenic mouse model (i.e., rTg4510 mice = a model of progressive neurofibrillary tangle pathology), alterations in brain metabolites (e.g., NAA, GABA, Glu) compared to wild-type mice were reported (Kim et al., 2017). in the tissue (Klunk et al., 1992). Supporting these findings, NAA/tCr correlated with postmortem Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (Kantarci et al., 2008). Posterior cingulate mIns/Cr was related to CSF total tau in AD (Bittner et al., 2013). Further research is needed to study the relationship between regional in vivo tau-pathology on PET and local tissue biochemistry, measured by in vivo 1H MRS.

One of the most widely used tau PET ligands is 18-F-flortaucipir (18F-AV-1451, henceforth, flortaucipir) (Chien et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2013). Ex vivo studies confirmed high affinity of flortaucipir to AD tau (Lowe et al., 2016; Marquié et al., 2015). Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrated that regional quantitative estimates of flortaucipir PET binding align with the Braak staging of the neurofibrillary tangle pathology of AD in a majority of the patients (Cho et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Schwarz et al., 2016). In addition, elevated tau deposition on flortaucipir PET has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline over time (Lu et al., 2021; Ossenkoppele et al., 2021). AD tau aggregates are composed of all three-repeat (3R) and four-repeat (4R) tau isoforms (Goedert et al., 1992). Flortaucipir strongly binds to mixture of three-3R/4R tau isoforms that are commonly observed in AD dementia, but it does not strongly bind to homogeneous 3R or 4R tau isoforms (Jones et al., 2018; Lowe et al., 2016). In vivo imaging of tau pathology overcomes some unavoidable disadvantages of postmortem studies, such as the time lag between clinical and imaging data and postmortem pathology data.

Recent studies have suggested that pathological tau may be more closely linked to neuronal injury and cognitive deficits than Aβ deposition, which occurs earlier in the pathological cascade (Coomans et al., 2021; Ossenkoppele et al., 2016). For example, lower NAA/Cr ratio (a MRS marker of neural integrity) was associated with worsened synaptic integrity, measured with SV2A synaptic vesicle protein, and higher phospho-tau pathology (neurites, pretangles, neurofibrillary tangles), but not with Aβ in an antemortem 1H MRS and neuropathology correlation study (Murray et al., 2014). Investigating the association of regional tau pathology, as measured by in vivo tau PET with the metabolic biomarkers of proton 1H MRS in cognitively unimpaired older adults, may shed light on the biological mechanisms associated with early AD.

In this study, we employed an advanced sLASER 1H MRS protocol (Terpstra et al., 2016), to quantify 1H MRS metabolites from posterior cingulate gyrus (Zeydan et al., 2017). 1H MRS can aid our understanding of Aβ and tau related neuronal changes since 1H MRS provides sensitive measure of metabolic homeostasis established by neurons and their surrounding cell partners (e.g., astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocyte)(Graff-Radford and Kantarci, 2013; Piersson et al., 2021; Su et al., 2016). The posterior cingulate gyrus was chosen as the 1H MRS voxel location for both technical and biological reasons. Technically, this region is sufficiently distant from tissue-air-CSF interfaces for optimal shimming and spectral quality. Biologically, this region shows structural, metabolic, and functional alterations early in the onset of AD (Kantarci et al., 2008; Leech and Sharp, 2014).

The overall objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the correlation of flortaucipir and PiB PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) with 1H MRS metabolite ratios acquired from the posterior cingulate gyrus in cognitively unimpaired older adults. We also evaluated whether these relationships between the brain metabolite ratios and PET SUVrs are modified by sex due to the reports of sex differences in tau deposition and cognitive outcomes (Buckley et al., 2019; Buckley et al., 2020). Determining posterior cingulate gyrus brain 1H MRS metabolites correlations with tau and Aβ deposition can provide us several insights into pathophysiological neural changes such as neural injury, neuroinflammation, and membrane turnover.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Subjects

We conducted a single voxel 1H MRS study in cognitively unimpaired older adults (n = 40; mean age (standard deviation, SD) = 77.1 (6.7)), who consequatively participated in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), a prospective population-based study of aging (Roberts et al., 2008). Participants of the current study underwent clinical evaluations, MRI, PiB PET and flortaucipir PET during the same visit. PET scans were performed on average within 1.5 (SD, 0.4) years before the 1H MRS exams. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and informed consent for participation was obtained from every participant and/or an appropriate surrogate.

2.2 Diagnostic criteria

Participants underwent an interview with a nurse or study coordinator, a neurological evaluation, and neuropsychological testing. The final decision on whether a person was cognitively unimpaired (not meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia) was made after a consensus agreement among the physician, study coordinator, and neuropsychologist who evaluated the participant. Visual or hearing deficits, demographic data such as age, education, and prior education, and all other relevant information on the participant were also considered during the decision process (Petersen et al., 2010). MCSA participants with neurological disorders such as a brain tumor, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or stroke, that would influence 1H MRS measurements, were excluded. Also, participants were excluded if they had a contraindicator to MRI and/or were unable to participate in imaging studies because of claustrophobia or other safety-related reasons.

2.3 MR acquisition and analysis

All MR imaging and spectroscopy data were acquired on a 3.0 T whole-body Verio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) at the Mayo Clinic Rochester. The body coil was used for RF transmission and a 32-channel head array coil was used for signal reception.

The three dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE) image volumes were obtained using the following parameters: repitition time/echo time = 2530/3.65 ms, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, field-of-view = 256 x 256 mm2, matrix size = 256 x 256, flip angle =700, spatial resolution = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. The single voxel 1H MRS data were acquired from a volume of interest (VOI) (20 × 20 × 20 mm3) in the posterior cingulate cortex. The VOI was automatically prescribed by an automated VOI prescription pipeline (AutoVOI) (Park et al., 2018). AutoVOI uses user-defined VOI on an atlas (i.e., MNI152) and transforms them into the subject’s native space during the scan. AutoVOI therefore reduces the need for expertise in manual voxel prescription and has been demonstrated to improve localization precision and reproducibility of 1H MRS metabolite measurements (Park et al., 2018). An example of the posterior cingulate gyrus VOI, returned by autoVOI, is shown in Fig. 1.

2.4 1H MRS Protocol

The 1H MRS acquisition and processing techniques were previously described in detail (Deelchand et al., 2015; Oz and Tkáč, 2011). Briefly, a single voxel 1H spectrum was acquired in the same session using a modified sLASER sequence (Oz and Tkáč, 2011) with VAPOR (Tkác et al., 1999) water suppression (TR/TE= 3000/30 ms, 80 water-suppreseed averages, 8 embedded unsuppressed water references, 70 Hz water suppression bandwidth, 2048 complex points and a spectral width of 6 kHz). B0 shimming was achieved using FAST(EST)MAP (Gruetter and Tkáč, 2000; Oz and Tkáč, 2011). The embedded unsuppressed water spectra were used for spectral quantification and for residual eddy current correction (Deelchand et al., 2015). After MRS data acquisition was complete, the raw MRS data were given an identification number. These data were de-identified and transferred to the University of Minnesota for quality control and quantification. For pre-processing, single-shot sLASER spectra were eddy-current, frequency and phase-corrected before summation using MRspa, a Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick in MA) tool box for processing 1H MRS data (Deelchand, 2016).

2.5 Metabolite ratio quantification

The pre-processed summed sLASER spectra were quantified using LCModel 6.3 (Stephen Provencher, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), a user-independent fitting routine based on a library of model spectra of all individual metabolites (Provencher, 2001), which was interfaced with MRspa. The basis set included model spectra for alanine (Ala), aspartate (Asp), ascorbate (Asc), glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PC), creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glucose (Glc), glutamine (Gln), glutamate (Glu), glutathione (GSH), myo-inositol (mIns), lactate (Lac), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), phosphoethanolamine (PE), scyllo-inositol (sI), taurine (Tau), and experimentally obtained macromolecules (Deelchand et al., 2012).

2.6 Quality control criteria for 1H MRS data

Based on the output of LCModel, the Cramér-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB), estimated errors of metabolite quantification, were assessed. Metabolites that had mean CRLBs ≤20 % across all participants were selected for statistical analysis. All concentrations except those for which the fitting failed and standard deviation (SD) could not be estimated (designated with a CRLB of 999% in LCModel) were used when calculating mean CRLBs for the group analysis. Since the absolute concentrations are prone to effects of brain atrophy, tissue relaxation time effects, and several other experimental conditions, we employed internal referencing using the tCr level in the denominator for metabolite ratio calculations. All preprocessing steps, quality control, and quantification protocols for the 1H MRS protocol were performed according to experts’ consensus recommendations for data acquired with sLASER MRS protocol (Öz et al., 2020). We did not have to reject any spectra due to a poor water line width since all water spectra had a full-width-at-half maximum smaller than 13 Hz (the mean associated water reference (n = 40) ± SD was measured as 7.0 ± 0.5 Hz). Concentrations of the metabolites with mean CRLB values (≤ 20) were reported relative to tCr. Since glucose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid is above the MRS detection limit, additional analysis steps are needed to estimate glucose concentration (Joers et al., 2017). Therefore, Glc/tCr ratio was not reported. If the % CRLB of metabolite sum (e.g., PCho/tCr + Cho/tCr) was lower than those of the components, we ignored the values of the components and reported only the sum (e.g., tCho). We reported Glu instead of the sum (Glu + Gln) since Glu, but not Gln, was reliably quantified, and the sum did not have lower % CRLB compared to Glu. If the covariance between two metabolite ratios was consistently high (correlation coefficient &lt;-0.7, such as GPC + PCho, and Cr + PCr) their sum was used. Based on these reliability critiera four metabolites were evaluated: Glu, NAA, tCho, and mIns. Total Cr was also reliably quantified and used as denominator for metabolite ratio calculations.

2.7 Flortaucipir and Pittsburgh compound B PET preprocessing and image analyses

Tau deposition was measured using 18F-flortaucipir tracer, and Aβ deposition was measured by using 11C PiB tracer on a PET/computed tomography scanner (DRX or DMI; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) operating in 3D mode. Tau PET images were acquired using four 5-minute dynamic frames that began 80 minutes post-injection of 370 MBq (range, 330–406 MBq) of flortaucipir. Aβ PET images were acquired using four 5-minute dynamic frames that began 40 minutes post-injection of 627 MBq (range, 384–722 MBq) of PiB.

The MPRAGE images collected at the same visit were used for the anatomical segmentation and labeling of PET images. The technical quality of PET images were inspected visually by a trained PET technician. Pre- and post-processing steps of PET images were performed as described earlier (Kantarci et al., 2017). Each tau PET image was rigidly registered to its corresponding MPRAGE using Statistical Parametric Mapping version 12 (SPM12) (Ashburner, 2009), and regional uptake values are extracted from automatically labelled regions of interest (ROIs) propagated from the MRI template (MCALT) (Schwarz et al., 2017) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt) using SPM12 and advanced normalization tools (Avants et al., 2011). The regional flortaucipir PET SUVr values were calculated by dividing the median uptake value in each ROI to the median uptake in cerebellar crus gray matter (Jack et al., 2017). The regional PiB SUVr values were calculated by dividing the median uptake value in each ROI to the median uptake in cerebellar crus gray matter. The PiB SUVr and flotauicipir PET SUVr were obtained from the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus ROI.

2.8 Statistical analysis

Participant characteristics were summarized using mean (± standard deviation, SD) for continuous variables and count (percentage, %) for the categorical variables. All PET SUVr values were log-transformed before conducting the analysis due to skewness.

We used partial Pearson correlations adjusted for age and sex to study the strength and direction of linear relationships between 1H MRS metabolite ratios and posterior cingulate gyrus PET SUVrs (PiB and flortaucipir). In addition, correlation of NAA and Glu was examined by partial Pearson correlation, controlling for age and sex. For partial Pearson correlations the direction can be positive or negative. In a positive relationship both variables tend to move in the same direction: If one variable increases, the other tends to also increase. Tests of significance were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR). FDR q-values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant. Both unadjusted p-values and adjusted q-values were reported. Because age has been associated with both Aβ and tau accumulation on PET (Jack et al., 2020) and 1H MRS metabolite alterations (Reyngoudt et al., 2012), age was included as a covariate to adjust for confounding. Since sex differences in tau deposition and cognitive outcomes have been reported, sex x PET SUVr interaction was added into the linear regression models (Buckley et al., 2019; Buckley et al., 2020).

To assess predictors of 1H MRS metabolite ratios, we fit linear regression models with 1H MRS metabolite ratios as responses. The models included PET SUVr (flortaupicir, PiB), PET SUVr (flortaupicir, PiB) x sex interaction term, sex and age. When an interaction term was not significant, it was dropped from the linear regression model, but sex was kept in the model as a covariate. Statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software version 3.6.2 (R-project.org).

3. Results

Demographics and clinical characteristics, PET imaging and 1H MRS findings of the participants are shown in Table 1, (n = 40). The mean age (SD) of the participants at the time of 1H MRS was 77.1 (6.7). Fig. 2A illustrates a representative 1H MR spectrum acquired from the posterior cingulate gyrus, and Fig. 2B shows the cortical uptake pattern of flortaucipir and PiB PET images of a cognitively unimpaired woman (age = 81) participant. The spectrum was acquired with an advanced single voxel sLASER 1H MRS protocol. The participant whose data are shown in Fig. 2 had relatively low NAA/tCr = 1.20 and Glu/tCr = 0.99 ratios, and elevated posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir SUVr = 1.22, and PiB SUVr = 3.06 compared to the mean values of the entire cohort displayed in Table 1.

Fig. 3 demonstrates age and sex-adjusted partial Pearson correlation coefficients (95% confidence intervals) as a measure of partial association of 1H MRS metabolite ratios with posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir and PiB PET SUVr (log-transformed). There was a negative partial correlation between the posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr and metabolite ratios [NAA/tCr (r = −0.431; p = 0.007) and Glu/tCr (r = −0.472, p = 0.011)], which remained statistically significant after FDR correction for multiple comparisons. Decreased N-acetylaspartate and glutamate are typically associated with neuronal injury. Partial correlations between the posterior cingulate gyrus PiB PET SUVr and metabolite ratios did not reach to statistical significance (p ≥ 0.41). Scatterplots of the association of NAA/tCr and Glu/tCr with flortaucipir PET SUVr are displayed in Fig. 4. Since both Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr correlated with tau deposition, we also investigated the partial correlation between Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr. There was a positive correlation between Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr (r = 0.50, p=0.001).

There was a significant posterior cingulate gyrus sex by tau (flortaucipir PET SUVr) - interaction (p = 0.04) only with the Glu/tCr ratio. When stratified by sex, the partial correlation between posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr and Glu/tCr ratio remained statistically significant in women (r = −0.66; p = 0.003) but not in men (r = −0.34; p = 0.15) (Fig. 5). The demographics and clinical characteristics of men and women were listed in the Supplementary Table 1. Demographics and clinical characteristics and 1H MRS metabolite ratios were not different between women and men. Although on average women exhibited a higher level of posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr than men, this difference did not reach statistical significance. The statistical summary of regression analysis is presented in Supplementary Table 2.

4. Discussion

The objective of the current study was to understand the association of posterior cingulate gyrus 1H MRS metabolite ratios with tau and Aβ pathologies, as measured by flortaucipir PET and PiB PET, in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Posterior cingulate gyrus tau deposition correlated strongly with lower Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr. In addition, we found that sex modified the correlation between flortaucipir PET SUVr and Glu/tCr ratio. The association between Glu/tCr and posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr was stronger in women than in men. Finally, a strong positive correlation was observed between NAA/tCr and Glu/tCr ratios. No significant association was observed between PiB PET SUVr and metabolite ratios.

The flortaupicir PET tracer has a high affinity to regional deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau isoforms with an equal balance of 3R + 4R microtubule-binding repeats in the brains of patients with AD (Xia et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012). Quantitative tau PET measurement is associated with the neuropathological staging of the neurofibrillary tangle tau pathology of AD (Fleisher et al., 2020; Lowe et al., 2020). We treated both flortaucipir and PIB PET SUVr as a continuous variable in this study. While previously established abnormality SUVr cutoffs can be used to define tau and Aβ normal (-) and abnormal (+) groups (Jack et al., 2017), the cutoffs may create a gray zone for values close to the cutoff point which can obscure the important relationships between biomarkers and pathophysiology across the entire spectrum (Nedelska et al., 2017).

We demonstrated that a decrease in NAA/tCr metabolite ratios correlated with elevated posterior cingulate gyrus tau deposition. This was particularly noteworthy for the regional correlation in the posterior cingulate gyrus considering the relatively small sample size. NAA, which is synthetized in mitochondria, is abundant in neurons. Higher NAA is considered a marker of neural health and synaptic integrity (Murray et al., 2014). A variety of studies demonstrated a decrease in NAA levels in AD compared with non-AD controls (Catani et al., 2001; Jessen et al., 2000; Kantarci et al., 2000; Klunk et al., 1992). In autopsy samples, NAA/tCr negatively correlated with the density of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the tissue (Klunk et al., 1992). Supporting these findings, NAA/tCr correlated with postmortem Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (Kantarci et al., 2008). Our results are also consistent with the earlier antemortem 1H MRS and postmortem histopathology study, which demonstrated that lower NAA/tCr is associated with higher tau density and lower synaptic integrity measured with synaptic vesicle (SV)2A marker in patients with a varying severity of AD pathology (Murray et al., 2014). We confirmed this finding in vivo by demonstrating lower NAA/Cr with increasing tau deposition in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Higher posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr was associated with impaired synaptic function measured by magnetoencephalography and synaptic density measured by SV2A using [11C]UCB-J PET in AD dementia (Coomans et al., 2021). These findings were further supported by CSF studies demonstrating higher CSF total tau and p-tau associated with lower NAA/tCr (Bittner et al., 2013), and elevated mIns/tCr ratios in probable AD (Bittner et al., 2013; Mullins et al., 2018) and mild cognitive impairment (Voevodskaya et al., 2016). Taken together with our findings, the biological mechanisms underlying the correlation between elevated tau pathology and decreased NAA/tCr ratio can be explained by tau-mediated neural injury with loss of synaptic function in cognitively unimpared older adults.

We demonstrated that lower Glu/tCr ratios correlated with elevated posterior cingulate gyrus tau deposition. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning, excitotoxicity, synaptic plasticity, synaptic transmission, neural growth, and differentiation (Danbolt, 2001; Ross, 1991). Glutamate from the synaptic cleft is transported into astrocytes where it is converted to glutamine. After glutamine is taken up by the neurons, it serves as a major precursor of glutamate in the neural compartment. This sequence of events is called the glutamate - glutamine cycle. While glutamate is primarily present in neurons, glutamine is mainly compartmentalized in astrocytes. It is challenging to separate glutamate from glutamine using conventional 1H MRS performed at 3 T and lower magnetic field strength due to overlapping spectra of glutamate and glutamine (Ramadan et al., 2013). In the present study, Glu/tCr ratio was reliably quantified by using an advanced 1H MRS protocol sLASER, at 3 T.

Our findings demonstrate an association between posterior cingulate gyrus tau deposition with decreased Glu/tCr ratio in cognitively unimpaired older adults. The decrease in glutamate level in the brain was thought to be linked to neuronal dysfunction (Segovia et al., 2001). A reduction in glutamate reported in patients with AD (Hyman et al., 1987; Rupsingh et al., 2011; Sasaki et al., 1986) and MCI (Riese et al., 2015; Zeydan et al., 2017) compared to cognitively unimpaired controls might be related to neuronal dysfunction. Glutamate transporters interact with phosphorylated tau and localize in neurofibrillary tangles in patients with AD dementia (Sasaki et al., 2009), and deficits in glutamate transporters are associated with neural injury or death of glutamatergic neurons through apoptotic and necrotic pathways (Revett et al., 2013). In a triple transgenic mouse model of AD, which forms Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and synaptic deficits, a disturbance in glucose mechanisms and a decrease in tricarboxylic acid cycle-related metabolites including glutamate and NAA was demonstrated (Sancheti et al., 2014). These results suggest that the balance of glutamatergic metabolites (i.e., glutamate, glutamine) will be steady as long as neural health, synapses and glutamate-glutamine cycle between neuron-astrocyte complex is preserved (Zeydan and Kantarci, 2021). Based on this consideration, our results support the concept of tau mediated loss of synaptic integrity involving glutamate neurotransmission in cognitively unimpaired older adults, as an indication of neural damage associated with tau deposition.

In this study, posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr was significantly associated with Glu/tCr and had a significant interaction with sex on Glu/tCr. Sex differences in tau levels (Altmann et al., 2014; Buckley et al., 2018; Buckley et al., 2019; Buckley et al., 2020; Damoiseaux et al., 2012; Hohman et al., 2018; Mosconi et al., 2017) and Glu levels (Hädel et al., 2013; O’Gorman et al., 2011; Wickens et al., 2018; Zahr et al., 2013) have been demonstrated, but whether sex modifies the correlation of flortaucipir PET SUVr with Glu/tCr has not been studied. Accumulating evidence suggests that sex differences exist in the pathologic trajectory of AD (Mielke et al., 2014). There is a higher prevelance of AD in women than in men (Mielke et al., 2014). It has been suggested that depletion of neuroprotective steroids such as estrogen and progesterone at natural and/or surgical menopause may influence the risk for AD in women (Paganini-Hill and Henderson, 1994; Zeydan et al., 2019). The role of estrogen on glutamate-glutamatine metabolism has been demonstrated suggesting that alterations in sex steroids (e.g. estrogen and progesterone) may not only influence AD pathology but may also influence the glutamatergic system (Haghighat, 2005). Furthermore, women with higher tau deposition on PET exhibit faster cognitive decline than men, suggesting vulnerability of women to tau-related cognitive decline (Buckley et al., 2020). In congruence, our findings suggest that in women, tau pathology has a stronger relationship with the loss of glutamatergic integrity than men. Long-term deprivation of ovarian hormones may be one of the promoters of a sex by tau (flortauipir PET SUVr) interaction on glutamatergic integrity, which needs further investigation.

In our study neither mIns/tCr nor tCho/tCr ratios correlated with in vivo tau load in cognitively unimpaired older adults. Our results are in line with earlier CSF studies measuring total tau and p-tau, and autopsy studies measuring p-tau which demonstrated that tau pathology was not correlated with mIns/tCr and tCho/tCr ratios (Bittner et al., 2013; Mullins et al., 2018). In microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutation carriers, elevated mIns/tCr ratio was associated with estimated or actual proximity to symptom onset (Chen et al., 2019). MAPT mutations result in filamentous accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons and glia (Chen et al., 2019). Individuals with MAPT mutations might have a more advanced stage of tau pathology compared with those without these mutations. Since flortaucipir PET SUVr levels were not measured in individuals with MAPT mutations, it is challenging to compare our study with this earlier study. Elevated Aβ burden, as measured by PiB PET, was associated with higher mIns/tCr ratio in cognitively healty older adults (Kantarci et al., 2011), however we did not find an association of tau deposition with mIns/tCr.

In our study the partial Pearson correlations of posterior cingulate gyrus PIB PET SUVr with 1H MRS metabolite ratios in cognitively unimpaired patients were not significant. These results are in line with one of our earlier studies (Zeydan et al., 2017). But in another study, performed in a larger cohort, we demonstrated a signficant correlation of mIns/tCr with PiB SUVr (Kantarci et al., 2011). The differences in statistically significant findings of these two studies might be attributed to the sample size differences. It is noteworty that the correlation coeffients between mIns/tCr and PiB SUVr were similar in both studies.

We found a strong correlation between Glu/tCr and NAA/tCr. Our results are in line with earlier studies, which demonstrated a positive correlation of NAA with glutamate (Kaiser et al., 2005; Waddell et al., 2011; Zahr et al., 2013) or glutamate plus glutamine (Kraguljac et al., 2012; Kraguljac et al., 2013), but not with another study (Klunk et al., 1992). A strong positive correlation between glutamate and NAA supports the notion that glutamate that is detectable by 1H MRS is primarily associated with the synaptic integrity (Zahr et al., 2013).

Our study has several strengths. First, well-optimized imaging and spectroscopy pipelines were used in a well characterized cohort from an epidemiological study. Second, we used an advanced 1H MRS protocol, which allowed us to reliably quantify four metabolites including glutamate. A limitation of this study was the modest sample size. Despite this, it is noteworthy that we could demonstrate significant partial correlations between tau pathology and metabolite ratios. Since the design of the study was cross-sectional, a cause-and-effect relationship could not be established. Another limitation of the study was the time interval between PET and MRS exams, which was approximately 1.5 years. Even though the time gap may be a confounding factor, it would not have impacted participants differently. Since all participants had the 1.5 year gap between MRS and PET exams. Therefore, even if tau pathology had increased in the interim, that increase in tau deposition would not have been different across the cognitively unimpaired participants.

Overall, the current data demonstrates that a decrease in NAA/tCr and Glu/tCr ratios are associated with elevated posterior cingulate gyrus flortaucipir PET SUVr, but not with PiB SUVr, suggesting the presence of neuronal and synaptic dysfunction in relation to tau accumulation in this region. In the future, the correlation of 1H MRS alterations with tau pathology needs to be confirmed in larger studies, and longitudinal studies are needed to investigate how these relationships evolve in those who develop mild cognitive impairment and AD compared to those who remain cognitively unimpaired

The thick red curve on the representative MR spectrum is the LCModel fit to the data. The thin curve under the spectrum is the fitted baseline. The residual (data minus the fit to the data) is shown at the top of the spectrum. The chemical shift axis is labeled in parts per million (ppm) unit. The Y axis is an intensity scale of each spectral line with no unit. (B) The representative cortical flortaucipir PET and PiB PET scans were acquired from the same participant. The participant had low NAA/tCr = 1.20 and Glu/tCr = 0.99, high PCG flortaucipir standard value uptake unit ratio of 1.22, and high PCG PiB standard value uptake unit ratio of 3.06. The PET scans were registered to the T1-weighted MR image and displayed together. We observed flortaucipir uptake in the skull of this participant. The meningeal and bone uptake of flortaucipir is known manifestation of off-target binding. The cause is unknown. In contrast such off-target uptake in PiB is not seen except with rare cases of bone uptake in diseases with high rates of bone remodeling (e.g., hyperostosis frontalis interna). The representative color scale shows the standardized uptake value ratios.
