pmcIntroduction

To fully appreciate the broad spectrum of benefits that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system offers as key treatments for various neuropathologies, we need to delineate how its expression profile is systematically orchestrated throughout the life span. Research scientists take advantage of well-established discoveries that have been made using a myriad of animal models and human clinical trials. However, an emergent scenario that invites us to look at innovative ways of understanding the mechanisms behind the cannabinoid’s (CBs) optimal effects is the presumptive association of the eCBs with distinct brain pathologies that arise throughout human brain development.

Since the discovery of the medicinal properties of the plant Cannabis sativa to alleviate pain, inflammation, and appetite disorders (Baron, 2015; Zou &amp; Kumar, 2018) its consideration as a treatment to manage numerous diseases continue to evolve. Its potential clinical application is susceptible to the recreational and illicit use of marijuana. Over 60 phytocannabinoids, naturally synthesized molecules from the cannabis plant, have been identified (Aizpurua-Olaizola et al., 2016; Zou &amp; Kumar, 2018) with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the main psychoactive component (Cohen &amp; Weinstein, 2018), yet one that has clinically served as an anti-emetic agent or appetite stimulator (Darmani, 2010; Di Marzo &amp; Matias, 2005) after its discovery in 1964 (Gaoni &amp; Mechoulam, 1964; Pertwee &amp; Ross, 2002). In contrast, two other compounds that were isolated and found to be nonpsychoactive are Cannabinol (Wood, Spivey, &amp; Easterfield, 1899) and Cannabidiol (CBD) (R. Mechoulam &amp; Shvo, 1963) (Table 1). CBD is currently approved as Nabiximol (Sativex) in Canada as a 1:1 ratio after combined with THC for pain management in patients with multiple sclerosis and cancer (Howard, Twycross, Shuster, Mihalyo, &amp; Wilcock, 2013). The broad effects that these and other phytocannabinoids have in humans rely on their action on two cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) and the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) which were characterized and cloned shortly after the identification of the THC binding sites in the brain (Table 1). CB1Rs and CB2Rs are members of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the couple to Gαi/o proteins. In association with endogenous ligands that bind to these CBRs, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA: anandamide), and their synthetic enzymatic machinery, these CBRs are key constituents of the eCB system (Lu &amp; MacKie, 2016; Pertwee &amp; Ross, 2002).

Pharmacological modulation of the eCB system provides unique opportunities to control the symptomatology and advancement of multiple diseases ranging from cancer and neuropathic pain to disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) (Kendall &amp; Yudowski, 2017; Robson, 1996). These benefits, however, can be masked by the complexity of the properties that distinguish the eCB system. For example, the polypharmacology of these ligands, the ability to activate multiple receptors, with non-specific binding to other GPCRs, ion channels and nuclear receptors (Glass &amp; Northup, 1999; McAllister &amp; Glass, 2002) expands the effects that CB ligands have in a system to the point of augmenting unwanted adverse effects or perhaps inducing metabolic disorders (Silvestri &amp; Di Marzo, 2013). Besides, CBRs can form heterodimers and although these tend to enhance signaling outcomes, this benefit is compromised by the lack of knowledge of which receptors dimerize in tissue areas which limit the development of selective CB treatments that target specific signaling pathways (Atakan, 2012; Hudson, He, &amp; Kelly, 2010).

This chapter reviews the clinical relevance of the eCB system, comprised of the CBRs, lipid-based endogenous CBs, and the enzymes responsible for their synthesis and hydrolysis. We will discuss the role of the CBRs in the physiology and pathology of the CNS. Particularly, in accordance with previous findings that show that the eCB system systematically expresses from early stages of development through adulthood in different cells of the CNS (Zurolo et al., 2010), we postulate that the aberrant alteration of this expression leads to the emergence of distinct neurological disorders discussed herein (Figure 1).

Cannabinoid Receptors, CB1Rs and CB2Rs

Following the discovery of Cannabinol, CBD and THC (Table 1), the identification of CBR1 as the binding site of THC led to the cloning of the CB1Rs and later CB2Rs (Matsuda, Lolait, Brownstein, Young, &amp; Bonner, 1990; Munro, Thomas, &amp; Abu-Shaar, 1993). CB1Rs and CB2Rs are two members of the large family of GPCRs. These receptors have seven transmembrane spanning domains accompanied by a large extracellular N-terminal domain and an intracellular C-terminal tail. Despite displaying a 44% amino acid sequence homology at the amino acid sequence level (Zou &amp; Kumar, 2018), CBRs display distinct characteristics, from tissue expression levels to their signaling and function.

CB1Rs was first described in the brain (Devane, Dysarz, Johnson, Melvin, &amp; Howlett, 1988), being most abundant in the cerebellum, substancia nigra pars reticulata, globus pallidus, neocortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus and at very low levels in the brainstem (Herkenham, Lynn, Little, Johnson, Melvin, De Costa, 1990; Herkenham et al., 1991; Mackie, 2005; Van Sickle et al., 2005). Their expression has also been detected to a lesser extent in the periphery, particularly in the testis (Howlett et al., 2002), the liver (Osei-Hyiaman et al., 2005), and other areas throughout the human body. While in humans they consist of 472 amino acids, in rodents they consist of 473 amino acids (Zou &amp; Kumar, 2018). Considered to be key constituents of retrograde signaling, CB1Rs locate at presynaptic sites of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons (Lu &amp; MacKie, 2016).

Upon synthesis of endogenous eCBs by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and diacylglycerol (DAG), CBRs become activated and lead to the inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Activation of CB1Rs is also accompanied by the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which in turn results in a drastic reduction of the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and of extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERK) signaling pathways, all of which regulate the expression of genes critical for cellular function (Benovic, 2004; Howlett, 1987; McAllister &amp; Glass, 2002). These signaling events converge in the inhibition of neurotransmitter release, hence reducing normally-induced depolarization of postsynaptic neurons (Bauer &amp; Göthert, 1999; Gessa, Mascia, Casu, &amp; Carta, 1997; I. Katona et al., 1999; Shen, Piser, Seybold, &amp; Thayer, 1996).

Although the function of CB1Rs is mainly confined to regulate CNS synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release (Mechoulam &amp; Parker, 2013), studies in these past decades have elucidated a myriad of functions in distinct populations of CNS cells that include cognition, learning, memory, pain perception and motor activities (Howlett et al., 2002). This is not surprising, considering the widespread CB1R expression on the brain and the presumptive role of glial cells in regulating CNS homeostasis and neuronal activity (Scheller &amp; Kirchhoff, 2016).

CB2Rs are prominently expressed in the immune system, specifically in B and T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and monocytes/macrophages (Basu &amp; Dittel, 2011; Cabral &amp; Griffin-Thomas, 2010; Tanasescu &amp; Constantinescu, 2010). They have also been described at lower levels than the CB1R, in microglial brain cells and against the past view, in hippocampal neurons (Li &amp; Kim, 2017; Mackie, 2005). Comprised by 360 amino acids in humans (Zou &amp; Kumar, 2018), given their high expression profile in the immune system, CB2Rs are thought to play a modulatory role in cytokine release during inflammation, especially resulting from tissue injury (Malfitano, Basu, Maresz, &amp; Bifulco, 2014). Although in the brain the function of CB2R appears to be unclear (Pertwee &amp; Ross, 2002), recent studies support a possible role in synaptic plasticity, addiction and diseases such as schizophrenia (SCZ) which tend to develop during late teen ages the to early 30s (Bonomo, Souza, Jackson, Crippa, &amp; Solowij, 2018; Cohen &amp; Weinstein, 2018; Gomes, Guimaraes, &amp; Grace, 2015; Stempel et al., 2016; Xi, Peng, Li, Song, &amp; Zhang, 2012).

The Endocannabinoid System in the Cells of the CNS

The endogenous ligands of the CBRs are referred to as “endocannabinoids” (eCBs). Out of the three eCBs known, AEA, 2-AG, and 2-arachidonyl-glycerol ether, AEA and 2-AG secondly, are best characterized (Devane et al., 1992; Hanus et al., 2001; Sugiura et al., 1995). Both endogenous ligands, AEA, and 2-AG, are derivatives from arachidonic acid and are considered fatty acid-derived neuronal neurotransmitters (Pertwee &amp; Ross, 2002). The classical view is that AEA and 2-AG which predominate in the brain (Stella, Schweitzer, &amp; Plomelli, 1997), are deactivated after hydrolysis by FAAH and/or the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) (Di Marzo, 1999; Howlett et al., 2002, 2004; Ulugöl, 2014). ECBs are released to the synaptic cleft on-demand following increase synaptic activity (Zou &amp; Kumar, 2018). Despite the long-held belief that establishes eCB’s function as retrograde messengers of presynaptic CB1Rs and mediators of synaptic plasticity inhibition (Lu &amp; MacKie, 2016), evidence also shows an unexpected postsynaptic neuronal localization of CB1Rs (Netzeband, Conroy, Parsons, &amp; Gruol, 1999; Salio, Fischer, Franzoni, &amp; Conrath, 2002). Should this postsynaptic expression of receptors translate into presynaptically localized eCBs or perhaps glia-derived eCBs (Romero-Sandoval, Horvath, Landry, &amp; DeLeo, 2009; Walter et al., 2003), remains to be further investigated.

In a recent study, the association of the CBRs with glial cells in the CNS was examined (Scheller &amp; Kirchhoff, 2016). Astroglia cells mainly express CB1Rs at perisynaptic processes and perivascular endfeet, and CB2Rs in response to inflammation during neurodegenerative disorders (Benito et al., 2003). Microglial, on the other hand, express CB2Rs (Li &amp; Kim, 2017; Maresz, Carrier, Ponomarev, Hillard, &amp; Dittel, 2005; Stempel et al., 2016; Walter et al., 2003; J. Zhang et al., 2003). While in astrocytes activation of the CB1Rs seem to play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity and modulating CNS blood flow during energy demands (Stella, 2013), microglia cells activation of the CB2Rs induces neuroprotection during CNS inflammatory processes or brain injury (Massi, Valenti, Bolognini, &amp; Parolaro, 2008) and it regulates microglia migration and proliferation (Carrier et al., 2004; Walter et al., 2003). Surprisingly, neuronal roles for the CB2Rs have also been described in the literature (Van Sickle et al., 2005), mainly as a cell-type-specific modulator of neuronal plasticity, memory, anxiety and of drug-seeking behaviors (D. Chen, Gao, Gao, Su, &amp; Wu, 2017; Morgan, Stanford, &amp; Woodhall, 2009; Quraishi &amp; Paladini, 2016; Stempel et al., 2016; H.-Y. Zhang et al., 2014). According to these and other studies, CB2Rs can no longer be excluded from the repertoire of potential therapeutic targets that improve the management of CNS pathologies, especially when their immunomodulation might open new avenues for the development of agents that treat inflammatory neuropathologies like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and ischemia (Aso &amp; Ferrer, 2016; M. Zhang et al., 2007). Whether targeting the prominently expressed CB1Rs or the CB2Rs, the goal is to manipulate the eCB system such that the cells of the CNS can selectively activate or deactivate targeted CBR pathways without promoting unwanted side effects.

General Downstream Signaling Mediated by CB1Rs and CB2Rs

Following ligand-induced receptor activation, is the stimulation of heterotrimeric Gαi/o proteins, adenylyl cyclase, and ion channels, among others (Howlett, 1987). Downstream signaling, however, can be differentially defined by multiple factors, all of which are part of the three different waves that mediate diverse activation of intracellular pathways (Gong et al., 2006; Lohse &amp; Calebiro, 2013; Nogueras-Ortiz &amp; Yudowski, 2016). The first wave is initiated at the plasma membrane by stimulation of immediate effectors such as G proteins. Although Gαi/o mainly drive the first wave of intracellular signaling, this may vary according to the receptor and the cell type. For example, activated CBR1 has been shown to stimulate Gs (Glass &amp; Northup, 1999). The second wave is initiated by CBR desensitization resulting from phosphorylation at the CBRs C-terminal loop and subsequent recruitment of different isoforms of the β-arrestin scaffold protein (Flores-Otero et al., 2014; Carlos Nogueras-Ortiz et al., 2017), which reinforces receptor desensitization and promotes internalization via clathrin-coated pits and β-arrestin mediated signaling (Flores-Otero et al., 2014; Carlos Nogueras-Ortiz et al., 2017; Priestley, Glass, &amp; Kendall, 2017). The third and final wave entails the activation of downstream pathways from CBRs that are located at endosomal compartments (Nogueras-Ortiz et al., 2017; Thibault et al., 2013; Tsvetanova, Irannejad, &amp; Von Zastrow, 2015).

Whether CB1R activation stimulates one wave over another, will strongly depend on the pharmacology of the ligand, its bias towards unique receptor conformations, and selected signaling pathways activated downstream (Kendall &amp; Yudowski, 2017). Emerging research has expanded our knowledge concerning how CBR ligands can induce these pathways for example by inducing unique receptor phosphorylation “bar-codes” (Delgado-Peraza et al., 2016) and arrestins (Benovic, 2004). A comprehensive study demonstrated that mutation of the CB1R at the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation sites, S426/S430, to alanine residues, not only decreased receptor internalization, but also reduced receptor desensitization via β-arrestin 1-dependent ERK1/2 activation (Ahn, Mahmoud, Shim, &amp; Kendall, 2013; Delgado-Peraza et al., 2016). These findings argue for a more elaborated, but targeted development of therapeutic compounds that are purposely prone to prevent CBR desensitization, which is responsible for the development of CB tolerance (Rubino et al., 2006).

Downstream signaling of CBRs is also reliable on the receptor’s activation by endogenous or synthetic ligands. While one particular ligand may selectively activate both CBRs, the “dwell time” of the receptor (i.e. the time during which β-arrestin coupled-CBRs are clustered in endocytic coated pits before internalization) may also vary (Flores-Otero et al., 2014; Glass &amp; Northup, 1999). Literature findings demonstrate that 2-AG exposure to hippocampal neurons induces prolonged CB1R dwell times accompanied by sustained β-arrestin signaling, while WIN 55,212–2 exposure induced shorter CB1R dwell times accompanied by G-protein signaling (Flores-Otero et al., 2014). These findings present the first level of complexity of ligand-induced CBR1 functional selectivity. Moreover, they indicate a mechanism through which β-arrestin and G-protein signaling can be modulated by CB1R endo- and synthetic CBs to control downstream pathways critical for neuronal activity, such as the ERK1/2 pathway (Rubino et al., 2006). Additional downstream cascades regulated by CBR activation include pathways associated with cellular growth, proliferation, migration, and cell death. These are the MAPK including the previously mentioned ERK family, p38-MAPK, and the c-jun-N-terminal Kinase (JNK) (McAllister &amp; Glass, 2002; Stella et al., 1997).

The Endocannabinoid System and CNS Disorders: Traumatic Brain Injury, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Epilepsy, and Autism

Cannabinoids and Traumatic Brain Injury

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating disease caused by blows or damage in the head that result in brain impairment. The depth of the impairment largely depends on the intensity of the mechanical force inducing the TBI, the brain area affected, and the duration of the impact (Dinsmore, 2013). Symptoms that are aimed during treatments are determined by the location and duration of brain damage, and these include thinking impairment, loss of consciousness, movement problems, sensory problems (hearing and visual), amnesia, dizziness, headaches, depression, personality changes, seizures and others (Corrigan, W., &amp; Orman, 2010; Roozenbeek, Maas, &amp; Menon, 2013).

Given the nature of TBI and the complexity of the mechanisms that abnormally alter after physical brain damage, the therapeutic approaches intend to minimize secondary brain injuries and manage the disease. Patients with mild or moderate TBI are therapeutically treated with medications that improve neurobehavioral, motor and cognitive functions, or surgery, while patients with severe TBI which are often paralyzed, receive neurocritical care.

Neither of these treatments is effective, and many TBI events are accompanied by internal secondary brain injuries such as cerebral neurochemical and metabolic changes, inflammation resulting from increases in intracranial pressure, hypoxia, neuronal and glial cell dysfunction, aberrant brain homeostasis, vasculature problems or even loss of brain tissue (Kinoshita, 2016; Madikians &amp; Giza, 2006; Park, Bell, &amp; Baker, 2008; Prins, Greco, Alexander, &amp; Giza, 2013). Lack of therapies that prevent these internal manifestations in TBI patients contributes to disease progression. For instance, following brain necrosis, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by polarized M1 macrophages results in a harmful cerebral inflammatory response which in turn increases the intracranial pressure (Braun et al., 2018). Patients whose cerebral edema is not controlled within a few hours of the brain trauma, are highly predisposed to suffer secondary neurological outcomes that may extend to permanent loss of brain function and therefore, physical disability (Madikians &amp; Giza, 2006; Prins et al., 2013).

The role of the eCBs as neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective therapeutic sources have attracted great attention to the scientific and clinical community (Mechoulam D; Shohami E., 2002; Shohami, Cohen-Yeshurun, Magid, Algali, &amp; Mechoulam, 2011). TBI-induced edema is not only characterized by the transition of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages to pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (Braun et al., 2018), but also by an exacerbation of the eCB system’s constituents after trauma (I. Katona et al., 1999; Panikashvili et al., 2001; Tchantchou et al., 2014). In a recent study, Braun M. and colleagues confirmed upregulation of the CB2R in a cortical impact TBI model (Braun et al., 2018) as previously shown (Donat et al., 2014). Over 50% of this CB2R was detected in macrophages in the peri-contusional cortex. Interestingly, CB2R receptor activation with a selective agonist, GP1a, not only provoked a transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, but brain infiltration of peripheral macrophages and cerebral inflammation was decreased. These effects were counteracted by inhibition of the CB2R with the antagonist AM630, therefore suggesting this receptor as a potential target to prevent pro-inflammatory macrophage-associated cytokine/chemokine release at sites of brain injury. In contrast to this study where no changes of CB1R expression were observed post-TBI, a different group demonstrated a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role for CB1R after its modulation by the eCB 2-AG (Lopez-Rodriguez, Mela, Acaz-Fonseca, Garcia-Segura, &amp; Viveros, 2016; Panikashvili, Mechoulam, Beni, Alexandrovich, &amp; Shohami, 2005; Panikashvili et al., 2006).

CBR activation does not only show promise as a potential TBI agent due to its anti-inflammatory effects but also due to their neurodegenerative actions. Although neurodegeneration has been linked to CB1R increases in oxidative stress (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010), an increase of the neuroinflammatory response following TBI seems to be the leading reason for this cellular death (Cruz-Haces, Tang, Acosta, Fernandez, &amp; Shi, 2017; DeKosky &amp; Asken, 2017; Faden &amp; Loane, 2015). Ligand-induced activation of CB2Rs, as well as the intracellular accumulation of endogenous ligands, attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and decreased neurodegeneration (Amenta, Jallo, Tuma, &amp; Elliott, 2012). However, a limiting factor should one envision therapies that accumulate endogenous ligands is that even when intracellular increases of eCBs ameliorate TBI outcomes, inhibiting CBR-ligand hydrolysis to achieve this increase could make patients more prone to suffer from CB-related adverse effects (Tchantchou &amp; Zhang, 2013).

Notably, the activation of the CBRs or an augment of their endogenous ligands by strategic inhibition of their metabolizing enzymes could be an effective therapeutic approach to prevent CNS deterioration after TBI. However further studies need to address the mechanisms through which components of the eCB system alter during the development of TBI as patients transition from a mild to a severe state. In addition to differences in the expression levels of the CBRs following brain trauma, variations in AEA and 2-AG eCBs have been documented after TBI (Panikashvili et al., 2006; Tchantchou et al., 2014). This is critical given that the eCB’s expression varies even under basal conditions in different brain areas (Mackie, 2005), and the extensive physiological and pathological roles of the whole eCB machinery are still being revealed. Considering the findings discussed, CB2Rs hold promise as an alternative approach to manage and prevent the progression of TBI. An advantage that exists for the CB2R is its nonpsychoactive properties that could serve patients with a better life quality as brain functioning is preserved after a traumatic impact.

Cannabinoids and Multiple Sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis (MS), is a chronic disease of the CNS characterized by the loss of motor and sensory function, due to an immune-mediated inflammation, demyelination resulting from focal lymphocytic filtration, and further axonal damage of neurons located in the brain and the spinal cord (Boyko &amp; Boyko, 2018; Hemmer, Kerschensteiner, &amp; Korn, 2015; Milo &amp; Miller, 2014; Przybek, Gniatkowska, Mirowska-Guzel, &amp; Członkowska, 2015; Sand, 2015; Trapp &amp; Nave, 2008).

Current treatments for MS are tailored to speed a patient’s recovery from attacks, delay disease progression, and relieve the symptoms which may vary among patients. However, there is currently no cure and given the lack of effectiveness of current treatments, many patients continue to present relapses and symptoms that put them at risk of increased disability (Rice, Cameron, &amp; Cameron, 2018), hence highlighting the need for novel treatments.

The use of CBs to alleviate MS symptoms has obtained attention over the past years (Colfiel et al., 2017; Rice et al., 2018). In a placebo-controlled clinical trial led by John Zajicek and colleagues, although spasticity was not improved after patient treatment with THC, patients reported an improvement in pain relief (Zajicek et al., 2003). Later in 2012, the clinical trial of Multiple Sclerosis and Extract of Cannabis aimed to investigate a standardized oral cannabis extract for the relief of muscle stiffness and pain (Zajicek, Hobart, Slade, Barnes, &amp; Mattison, 2012). Their results showed that patients that received the cannabis extract presented a significant relief in muscle stiffness in comparison with patients in the placebo group (Zajicek et al., 2012). Although it is not clear how CBs relief pain in MS patients it has been suggested that these positive effects are mediated by the brain’s CB1Rs (Rice et al., 2018). To support this view, a study conducted using a mouse model of MS demonstrated that CBRs antagonism worsens the spasticity and muscle stiffness, while CB agonist inhibits spasticity (Baker et al., 2001). Besides, this study suggests that the equilibrium of CBs is affected during spasticity in response to defective neuronal signaling (Baker et al., 2001).

Not surprisingly, the use of CBs in MS is considered from the perspective of an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective approach. (Tanasescu &amp; Constantinescu, 2010). Despite the predominance of CB2Rs in the immune system, the immunosuppressive actions of CBs which decreases T cell proliferation (S. Katona, Kaminski, Sanders, &amp; Zajicek, 2005), inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines (Jean-Gilles, Gran, &amp; Constantinescu, 2010), and induces apoptosis of T-cells (Rieder, Chauhan, Singh, Nagarkatti, &amp; Nagarkatti, 2009), appear to be mediated by the independent endogenous activation of CB2Rs expressed in immune cells and activation of CB1Rs in neurons (Croxford et al., 2008; Maresz et al., 2007). Hence, the idea is to develop a combination of distinct therapeutic modalities for MS, one that augments that endogenous activation of CB2Rs to counteract the pro-inflammatory aspects of the disease and another that activates the CB1Rs to delay disease progression by reducing the speeding process of the symptoms as patients deteriorate. The anti-inflammatory effect is one that will attenuate pain, while the neuroprotective approach mediated mainly by CB1R activation will prevent neurodegeneration (Baker &amp; Pryce, 2008; Pryce et al., 2003).

One challenge in MS is dose-escalation, possibly making patients more vulnerable to psychiatric side effects (Semple, McIntosh, &amp; Lawrie, 2005) or cognitive impairment (Pavisian et al., 2014; Rice et al., 2018). Future work should focus in defining the dose-dependent effects that CBs exert in the different types of MS, given that the expression of the CB1Rs and the CB2Rs, and perhaps their endogenous ligands, may vary according to the stage of the disease. Should there be a correlation between the expression of the eCB system components and the different stages of MS, patients could receive a targeted and more personalized treatment that improves motor and sensory functions, hence preventing MS progression.

Cannabinoids and Alzheimer’s Disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative illness considered the most common cause of dementia (Korolev, 2014). It affects brain areas including the hippocampus, the neocortex, the limbic system, the frontal, and the temporal lobes (Masters et al., 2015). AD is distinguished by the lack of amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance from the CNS, the presence of abnormally folded tau and Aβ-associated plaques and tangles, hyperphosphorylated tau, oxidative stress, increase in cerebrospinal fluid Aβ oligomers and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglia and astrocytes (Hölttä et al., 2013; Karran &amp; De Strooper, 2016; Cabezas, Batista, &amp; Rol, 2014; Maccioni et al., 2018; Wang, Gu, Masters, &amp; Wang, 2017). Presentation of AD symptoms vary according to the stage of the disease as it progresses, from the mild to moderate stage and finally, to severe late stage. As a result, treatment for AD is multimodal as it involves a combination of clinical and caregiver care along with pharmacological management. Despite the presumptive effect of these therapies in treating dementia, they do not prevent progression to late stages of the disease (Korolev, 2014; Scheltens et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). The development of multitarget agents is highly needed given the complex pathogenesis of this disease that has shown to integrate contribution from the CNS as well as the peripheral system (Wang et al., 2017).

Post-mortem samples of AD brains have served as a tool to delineate whether CB use is an ideal option to treat AD patients. Concerning receptor expression, research findings show overexpression of CB2R levels, yet a downregulation of CB1R levels (Solas, Francis, Franco, &amp; Ramirez, 2013), although for CB1Rs, findings are controversial (Lee et al., 2010) and may be dependent on disease progression or their role in regulating cognitive functions (Manuel, De San Román, Giralt, Ferrer, &amp; Rodríguez-Puertas, 2014; Ramirez, 2005). Also, eCBs as well as exogenous CBs have demonstrated to be neuroprotective by preventing Aβ-induced neurotoxicity in cellular and animal models of AD (Koppel &amp; Davies, 2008; Maroof, Pardon, &amp; Kendall, 2013). Interestingly, although memory retention has been achieved in animal models that received brain injections of Aβ peptide, the subsequent increases of the 2-AG and CB2R levels detected appear to be dependent on elevations in the expression of the CB1R which increases at later stages halting the improvement in memory retention (Bisogno &amp; Di Marzo, 2008). Another possibility for the early CB2R increases is the result of an immediate inflammatory response activation (Ehrhart et al., 2005; Koppel &amp; Davies, 2008). This is consistent with the presence of high levels of CB2R in microglia surrounding senile plaques analyzed from post-mortem AD brains (Aso &amp; Ferrer, 2016).

Despite the evidence of eCBs as potential regulators of AD pathology and progression, further studies are required to clarify the mechanisms through which CBR modulation by agonists or antagonists regulate brain cognitive functions, neuroprotection, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Up-to-date, CB-derived therapeutic interventions (Nabilone and Dronabinol), in clinical trials pipeline for AD, are tailored to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as agitation, as well as improve appetite and relieve pain effects (Cummings, Lee, Ritter, &amp; Zhong, 2018). However, since 2003 no drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AD (Cummings, Lee, Ritter, &amp; Zhong, 2018), thereby highlighting the need for novel interventions that enable the proper diagnosis and prevention of AD progression.

Cannabinoids and Parkinson’s Disease

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder (Ferreira &amp; Romero-Ramos, 2018) distinguished by a decrease in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (Ferreira &amp; Romero-Ramos, 2018; Obeso et al., 2008) and the appearance of Lewy bodies (i.e. aggregations of α-synuclein in brain areas). The loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to a malfunction of the basal ganglia circuitry (Obeso et al., 2008), and results in the classic symptoms of PD: tremors, bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and postural instability (Aarsland et al., 2018; Chen-Plotkin et al., 2018; Gopalakrishna &amp; Alexander, 2015). For these symptoms to reflect in movement and motor function impairment, loss of dopaminergic neurons needs to exceed over 60% (Rodriguez-Oroz et al., 2009). Nevertheless, individuals with PD can present non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive decline and dementia (Aarsland et al., 2018).

Currents treatments for PD aim to decrease the symptoms and the progression of the condition. A dopamine agonist (Levodopa) is the goal standard drug prescribed to PD patients to help control the tremors (Connolly &amp; Lang, 2014). Non-pharmacological treatments are also available to can be provided to PD patients if the sole intake of pharmaceutical agents is not efficient. Examples include cognitive training, physical exercise, and neurostimulation (Aarsland et al., 2018).

Studies done in mice and humans have improved our understanding of the mechanistic factors leading to PD pathology (Bilkei-Gorzo, 2012) and the potential effects of CBs in improving the outcomes of this disease (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2007; García-Arencibia, García, &amp; Fernándezruiz, 2009; Lago &amp; Fernandez-Ruiz, 2007; Lim, See, &amp; Lee, 2017; Price et al., 2009; Sagredo et al., 2007). The rationale for this relies on the well-supported findings that show a significant increase of CB1R in PD-associated brain areas, such as the basal ganglia where neurons interact with excitatory, inhibitory and dopaminergic neural circuits responsible for the control of movement (Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2013; Turner, Chueh, Ortiz, Stokes, &amp; Small-Howard, 2017) and the cerebellum (Price et al., 2009). Furthermore, CBs are capable of disrupting protein aggregation (Cao et al., 2014), serving as preclearance and as an anti-oxidant agent (Dando et al., 2013; Silvestri &amp; Di Marzo, 2013). In contrast to the CB1R expression in pre- and postsynaptic neuronal sites and to a lesser level in glial cells (Pazos, Núñez, Benito, Tolón, &amp; Romero, 2005; Stella, 2013), CB2Rs localize in the dorsal root ganglia, in granules and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Beltramo et al., 2006; Hsieh et al., 2011; Rodríguez-Cueto et al., 2014; Skaper et al., 1996). Despite the discrepancy in published reports, CB2Rs have also been documented in perivascular microglial cells of the cerebellum, in pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex, in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, in inhibitory GABAergic neurons as well as in neurons localized in the CA1 hippocampal and substantia nigra (Benito et al., 2003; den Boon et al., 2012; Lanciego et al., 2011; Morgan et al., 2009; Núñez et al., 2004; Onaivi, 2011; Sagredo et al., 2009; Stampanoni Bassi, Sancesario, Morace, Centonze, &amp; Lezzi, 2017). When considering the expression profile and potential functional implications, the best therapeutic target for PD appears to be the CB1Rs which if absent in PD animal models and humans, results in motor deficits that improve after modulation of dopaminergic pathways (Lane, Chan, Lupica, &amp; Pickel, 2010; Pérez-Rial et al., 2011). However, a neuroprotective role is strongly imparted by CB2Rs. They not only obstruct the production of neurotoxins by glia cells, but they also counteract the high oxidative stress atmosphere that results from dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD and prevents blood-brain barrier leakage (Chung et al., 2016; Javed, Azimullah, Haque, &amp; Ojha, 2016).

Research areas that explore the possibility of using CBs are an alternative or adjuvant therapy for PD need to consider remaining challenges. First, even when studies show that nicotine and marihuana smoke improves motor functions (Babayeva, Assefa, Basu, Chumki, &amp; Loewy, 2016; Page, Verhoef, Stebbins, Metz, &amp; Levy, 2003), smoke in itself is a risk factor for the development of other diseases like cancer (Al-Obaide, Ibrahim, Al-Humaish, &amp; Abdel-Salam, 2018). Second, although CBs ameliorates motor dysfunction, in the case of PD, surviving dopaminergic neurons compensate for the disease-induced dopaminergic neuronal loss, hence enabling dopamine availability in the brain (Turner et al., 2017) which in turn reduces the need for a possible cannabinoid demand. Third, non-cannabinoid receptors that can be activated by cannabinoid ligands (Stampanoni Bassi, Sancesario, Morace, Centonze, &amp; Lezzi, 2017; Turner et al., 2017) and may mask the efficiency of CB1 or CB2 activation in PD models.

Despite these challenges, the studies discussed in this section as well as others argue for therapeutic value in the modulation of the CBRs for controlling PD symptoms.

Cannabinoids and Epilepsy

Epilepsy (Epi) is a brain disorder that predisposes an individual of any age, to generate epileptic seizures due to excessive neuronal activity (Duncan, Sander, Sisodiya, &amp; Walker, 2006) and unpredicted interruptions of normal brain function (Fisher et al., 2005). Risk factors involved in the development of epilepsy include head trauma, infections in the CNS, cerebrovascular disease, and tumors (Duncan et al., 2006). Although seizures can occur at any age during development, they are more common in children than are less than 2 years and adults older than 55 years of age (Epilepsy Foundation, 2018).

Seizures can be presented according to the location of onset in the brain, dissemination patterns, brain maturity, among other factors (Fisher et al., 2005). The most common symptoms in epilepsy are loss of consciousness, impaired movements, impaired vision and hearing, a deficit in cognitive functions, and sudden extension or flexion of the body extremities (Stafstrom &amp; Carmant, 2015).

Current treatment for this neurological disorder is based on anti-epileptic actions, the goal is to decrease the abnormal exacerbated neuronal activity, hence resulting in a reduction of the patient’s symptoms. Anti-epileptic drugs work by blocking sodium or calcium channels, which prevents the depolarization of neurons while enhancing the function of the potassium channels (Stafstrom &amp; Carmant, 2015). A primary outcome of the anti-epileptic drugs is that they promote gamma–aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter to inhibit neuronal activity, and inhibit glutamate neurotransmitter, which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter responsible for the induction of neuronal activity (Stafstrom &amp; Carmant, 2015). Although there are various treatments for seizures, no drug fully prevents the development of epilepsy (Rosenberg, Tsien, Whalley, &amp; Devinsky, 2015).

Throughout history, cannabis has been used to treat seizures. Mechanistically, CBs regulate neuronal activation and excitability (Soltesz et al., 2015) and this has shown promise in disorders like epilepsy. In a survey conducted in Australia, the principal reason for the use of cannabis in patients with epilepsy was to have better control of treatment-resistant epilepsy and to reduce the side effects that are induced by the majority of anti-epileptic drugs (Suraev et al., 2017). In animal models, administration of THC to treat seizures induced anti-epileptic actions (Devinsky et al., 2014) consistent with the effects observed in humans exposed to CBD (Hill, Williams, Whalley, &amp; Stephens, 2012). To support this view, a study conducted by Jones and colleagues (2010) was able to validate the anti-seizure properties of CBD using both in vitro and in vivo models (Jones et al., 2010). In the in vitro model using extracellular multi-electrode array recordings, the results showed that CBD was able to decrease the epileptiform activity in the mammalian hippocampus, decreasing the amplitude and duration of the local field potential burst, therefore, decreasing the neuronal hyperactivity. In an animal model, CBD also exerted anti-epileptic effects, lowering the incidence of seizures when compared to the untreated animals (Jones et al., 2010). In this report, the CBD-induced anti-epileptic role was surprisingly independent of mechanisms mediated by CB1R, which is highly expressed in the hippocampus (Jones et al., 2010). Instead of binding to CB1R, CBD activates CB1R non-associated pathways (Devinsky et al., 2014).

Following the use of CBD for epilepsy, a recent clinical study aimed to determine the effect of highly purified CBD (Epidiolex) in epileptic patients, characterized the adverse effects, seizure severity, and seizure frequency in the individuals (Szaflarski et al., 2018). The outcomes of the trial showed that during week twelve there was a significant improvement of adverse effects, seizure severity, and seizure frequency in patients (Szaflarski et al., 2018). Extending other studies that suggested CBD as an alternative treatment for patients that are resistant to standard therapies for epilepsy, Devinsky and colleagues investigated the effects of CBD in children and young adults that were not optimistically affected by anti-epileptic drugs (Devinsky et al., 2016). The results of this study show that CBD reduces seizure frequency in patients (Devinsky et al., 2016), and complementary clinical work that evaluated the safety of CBD in epileptic children showed safety and efficacy (Chen et al., 2018). Overall, these findings demonstrate that CBD adverse effects can be manageable, and that some of the adverse effects reported by patients and caregivers may not be related to CBD (Chen et al., 2018).

In a separate study, a group of scientists determined the role of CB2R using the maximal dentate activation (MDA) rat model of human partial epilepsy (Rizzo et al., 2014). The authors evaluated the anti-epileptic action of the agonist WIN 55,212–2 and the antagonist AM630, which is specific for CB2R. Results demonstrated that distinct from animals that displayed a decrease in epileptic activity after treated with WIN 55,212–2 alone, or in combination with AM630, those exposed to AM630 alone did not have an anti-epileptic effect (Rizzo et al., 2014). These outcomes could imply that when CB2R is antagonized by AM630, more WIN 55,212–2 is linking to the CB1R (Rizzo et al., 2014), enhancing the response of CBRs as anti-epileptic agents, consistent with previous studies that suggested CB1R involvement in the reduction of seizures (Deshpande et al., 2007). According to these findings, the authors suggested that CB2R has no direct effect in the reduction of epileptic activity in the MDA model (Rizzo et al., 2014). Even when further research needs to define if CB1R, CB2R, or both are good regulators of epileptic events, convincing evidence highlight the potential of CBs as a treatment for epilepsy.

Cannabinoids and Autism Spectrum Disorder

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized mainly by repetitive patterns of behaviors, impaired reciprocal social interactions, impaired communication, stereotypical motor behaviors, restricted interests, and cognitive deficits (Gu, 2017; Habib, Al-Regaiey, Bashir, &amp; Iqbal, 2017; Khalil, 2012; Quattrocki &amp; Friston, 2014).

The signs and symptoms of patients with ASD vary, but there are two important areas affected in these patients: social communication and sensory-motor behaviors (Lord, Elsabbagh, Baird, &amp; Veenstra-Vanderweele, 2018). Other indicators for ASD are attention deficit, affective behavior deficit, poor response to his/her name, poor visual attention, and mood variation (Zwaigenbaum, 2009).

The gold standard treatment for ASD is directed toward occupational and physical therapy in combination with antipsychotic drugs. The drugs used in ASD patients target mostly agitation, irritability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Lord et al., 2018). However, none of these therapies for ASD are completely effective (Gu, 2017).

The use of CBs in patients with ASD is quite controversial when compared to its use in other brain disorders, since the majority of individuals are diagnosed during childhood or at times, adolescent periods (Figure 1). In 2010 a case-study of an autistic child aimed to evaluate the use of THC as a supplementary therapy. Results demonstrated a reduction in hyperactivity, lethargy, irritability, and improvement in the child’s speech (Kurz &amp; Blaas, 2010). Anecdotal reports suggested that the use of CBD is a viable treatment for anxiety, convulsions, and the motor and behavioral dysfunctions observed in ASD patients (Gu, 2017). Consistent with this, a study using an animal model showed that small doses of CBD improved social interactions that are characteristics of this disorder (Kaplan, Stella, Catterall, &amp; Westenbroek, 2017).

Currently, different theories suggest that a dysregulation or dysfunction in the oxytocin system, could be involved in the development of ASD (Quattrocki &amp; Friston, 2014). Oxytocin is a neuropeptide hormone indispensable for social behavior, and so far it seems to improve social behavior in humans (Yatawara, Einfeld, Hickie, Davenport, &amp; Guastella, 2016) and animal models (Peñagarikano et al., 2015). Previous evidence supports the idea that the activation of CB1R via anandamide is necessary for an improvement in social interaction (Wei et al., 2015). Moreover, the signaling mechanism mediated by anandamide and CB1R is associated and driven by oxytocin (Wei et al., 2015). The exposure to oxytocin improves anandamide mobilization to the nucleus accumbens, which is a vital region of the CNS involved in the reward circuit (Wei et al., 2015), and critical for normal social skills. The dysfunction of this signaling mechanism and the reward circuit could explain impaired social behaviors in patients with ASD.

Consistent with previous studies of the CBR’s role in the immune system, their anti-inflammatory actions in ASD are also a target considering that neuroinflammation has been identified in the post-mortem brains of ASD patients (Vargas, Nascimbene, Krishnan, Zimmerman, &amp; Pardo, 2005). In examining peripheral inflammatory responses, a study in children with ASD sought to determine the association between the eCB system and the immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Researchers found that the mRNA and protein levels of CB2R were upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ASD patients (Siniscalco, Sapone, Giordano, &amp; Cirillo, 2013). Although these results may be indicative of a role of CB2Rs in ASD pathogenesis (Siniscalco et al., 2013), another interpretation of the findings is that CB2Rs could be imparting a protective role in ASD, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (Pacher, 2012). Overall, better understanding and validation of this data could help in the development of a diagnostic tool using CB1R and/or CB2R expression as potential biomarkers for ASD.

Conclusion

The studies discussed in this chapter support the involvement of CBR activation regulating CNS disorders that develop throughout the life span. Their altered expression during the development and progression of neuropathologies seems to be in many cases the result of the brain system’s defense mechanisms against threatening events. As part of this defense mechanism, CBR stimulation is apt to protect the cells of the brain, as well as to encourage an appropriate homeostatic environment that enables proper neuronal function partly facilitated by the dynamic supporting role of glia cells. Due to the high level of complexity of the eCB system, major challenges that need to be addressed in future research include a full characterization of the system that helps us understand first, how are the components of the eCB system expressed in neurons and glial cells in distinct brain regions throughout development? How can CBs activate non-CBRs? Is it possible that the activation of non-CBRs mask the stimulation of CBRs after a pathological manifestation of the CNS? Is there a correlation between the expression levels of CBRs or their ligands with specific stages of a disease? What determines if one CBR overexpresses to compensate for the loss of the other CBR? These are some questions that need attention. Should they be answered, they could prompt the beginning of a new era for the development of personalized CB-based medicines that target CNS disorders from a neuroprotective and/or inflammatory approach.
