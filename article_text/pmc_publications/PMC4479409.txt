To the Editor

The extent to which older adults use technological devices while driving is understudied. Currently, there are 35 million adults over the age of 65 years who are licensed drivers in the United States (U.S.)1 and this number is expected to rise to more than 40 million by 2020.1 In a 2007 report, it was estimated that a quarter of all crashes in the U.S. is related to distracted driving due to interaction with communication devices, entertainment systems, etc.2 Despite an increase in the number of older drivers1 and in crash rates due to distracted driving,2 research has not focused on older adults and distracted driving as related to the use of electronic devices3. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and frequency of technology usage while driving in a sample of older adults.

Methods

Participants enrolled in a study that examined factors associated with driving performance among older adults (R01-AG043434) at Washington University in Saint Louis School of Medicine. Participants met these inclusion criteria: at least 65 years of age, speak English, currently drive at least once per week, has a valid driver’s license, does not require adaptive equipment to drive, and cognitively normal as indicated by a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)4 of 0 determined at their yearly clinical assessment. Each participant completed a general physical and neurological examination, health and medication histories, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 5 at their clinical assessment, and tests of driving and additional cognitive assessment at the time of their annual driving evaluation. This study was approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board. The Electronic Drive Survey (EDS) was administered verbally at the time of cognitive assessment during their annual driving evaluation. The survey consists of 37 questions and evaluates the type and degree of electronic device usage while driving. The survey is separated into six categories, which include use of: a radio, dashboard controls, global positioning system (GPS), cellular telephone (including hands-free), text messaging, and smart phone capable phones (for e-mailing purposes). Each category contains an initial “yes or no” question to determine if the participant engages in the activity; within the category are questions responded to on a three point Likert scale (never, sometimes, and always). See Table 1.

Demographic characteristics were calculated using descriptive statistics. Percentage of responses and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all 37 questions of the EDS. Logistic regression was conducted for the six category-of-use questions with binary responses (e.g. yes or no) while age, education and gender were included in the models as predictors. Differences in age and education on frequency of use for the 31 remaining questions were calculated using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), where the categorical response (never=0, sometimes=1, always=2) was the independent variable, while age and education were dependent variables. Chi-square statistics were generated to determine whether there were gender differences in responses to the 31 questions. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 21 (Chicago, Illinois, USA).

Results

There were 100 participants who completed the EDS. Participants mean (SD) age was 73.4 ± (4.7) years, about one-half were women (51%), their mean education level was 16.1 (2.6) years, they were all cognitively normal (MMSE 29.4±1; CDR 0±0), and were predominantly Caucasian (91%). Table 1 presents responses for all 37 questions of the EDS. While driving, 91% of participants used the radio, 79% adjusted dashboard controls, 56% used a cellular phone, 39% used a GPS, 3% reported texting while driving, and 2% e-mail with a smart phone while driving. Age was a significant predictor of using a cellular phone while driving and owning a smart phone; with younger age being associated with cellular phone use (t (98) = 2.24, p = .027) and ownership of smart phones (t (98) = 3.32, p = .001). Women were more likely than men to own a smart phone ((X2(1, 100) = 4.84, p = &lt;.028).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this survey is the first to capture the use of several electronic devices among older adults (≥65 years) while driving. We found that older adults are engaging with a variety of potentially-distracting electronic devices while driving. Given the hazards of distracted driving found in other research2,6,7,8,9, together with the frequency of distracted driving activities due to in-car technologies found in this study, electronic device use may be placing older adults and society at increased risk for motor vehicle crashes. The benefits and risks of these devices in a growing aging population needs further study.
