Objective

To examine the effect of race in driving performance and behavior prospectively among cognitively normal older adults.

Methods

Cognitively normal participants (Clinical Dementia Rating 0), ≥ 65 years of age (n=177) were selected from prospective, longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Washington University. Self-reported driving behavior (Driving Habits Questionnaire (DHQ)) and driving performance (road test) were annually assessed. Daily driving behavior data were collected using the Driving Real World In-Vehicle Evaluation System (DRIVES). Baseline differences between African Americans and Caucasians were tested using t-tests and general linear models. Amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers were compared across groups. Linear mixed models examined change in daily driving behavior over time. Survival analyses tested time to a marginal or fail rating on the road test.

Results

There were no differences between African Americans (n=34) and Caucasians (n=143) in age, sex, education or vascular risk factors. Baseline self-reported driving behavior and road test performance were largely similar for both races. Longitudinal analyses using the DRIVES data aggregated monthly showed that African Americans had a greater reduction in number of trips made per month, miles driven per month and trips with aggressive behavior compared to Caucasians. These effects remained after controlling for AD biomarkers, age, education, and sex.

Conclusions

In this sample of cognitively normal older adults, African Americans had a greater reduction of daily driving behavior compared to Caucasians. Observed racial differences may reflect differences in environmental/social factors, changes in cognition, and/or physical functioning.

Introduction

By 2050, the population of the United States (U.S.) will increase to 400 million, when the number of older adults will double to 88 million, and one in five Americans will be age 65 or older [1]. This increase will be accompanied by greater racial and ethnic diversity, such that more than one-half of the US population will belong to a minority group [2]. This accelerated population growth has a plurality of societal implications. Economic trends suggest that 35% of older adults are not retiring at the traditional age of 65, but remain employed in full/part-time jobs into their 70s [3]. Continued participation in the labor force after conventional retirement (age 65) has been associated with workers who had better physical health but lower savings/net worth [3, 4]. Life-expectancy for older adults has also increased such that a 65 year-old can expect to live 19+ years and an 85 year-old can expect to live on average six to seven years [4].

As a corollary outcome of the growing population, there will also be a notable increase in older (≥ 65 years old) drivers on the road—it is estimated by 2050, one in four drivers will be an older adult [5, 6]. In the U.S., transportation is necessary for sustained employment, access to healthcare and services, and social participation. Older adults are retaining and using their driving licenses longer, and driving more miles than they have in the past [7]. The percentage of older adults who hold a driver’s license continues to increase over time, counter to the overall trend of decline, particularly among young adults [8]. Crash, injury, and fatality risk is higher for older drivers, when exposure is accounted for [7], due to increases in frailty [9] and low mileage bias [10]. Even with the availability of other mobility options, older drivers more often prefer to drive themselves or be transported in a personal vehicle [11]. Relatedly, there were 260,000 injures and over 6,800 deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes in 2015 among drivers ≥ 65 years old [12]. Fatal crashes in 2015 progressively grew with age starting at 70, were most frequent for those ≥ 85 years old and associated with gender—male drivers were three times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash compared to female drivers [5]. Since older adults are working and driving longer, motor vehicle crashes will likely increase especially with age.

Adults age 65 and older have an increased risk of developing dementia. Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is expected to more than triple from 5.3 million to 14 million older adults by 2050, with half of the prevalence being attributed to persons age 85 or older [13]. Over the past 30 years, a number of clinical studies have shown that compared to healthy controls, persons with symptomatic AD are at an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes [14–16], have a higher likelihood of failing a road test and/or crashing during simulator tests of driving performance [17–19], and demonstrate faster decline in driving performance when dementia is more severe [20–22]. A recent meta-analysis found that patients with mild cognitive impairment were more likely to fail a road test compared to healthy controls. In addition, worse driving performance was associated with deficits in multiple domains including executive function, attention, and visuospatial performance [23]. The availability of molecular AD biomarkers offers insight into the long, preclinical stage where a person remains asymptomatic (i.e. cognitively normal) but the pathophysiological process of AD has started.

Recent studies have explored the relationship between preclinical AD via biomarkers (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], imaging) and driving decline in cognitively normal individuals. One study found that cognitively normal older adults with preclinical AD (abnormal CSF and PET amyloid) made 2.5 more errors on average [24]. A follow up study using the same sample found that those with preclinical AD were faster to receive a marginal or fail rating on a road test compared to those with lower levels [25]. Most importantly, there were no statistically significant differences between groups on neuropsychological measures at baseline representing cognitive function or self-reported driving. A third study found a higher number of traffic violations and crashes in cognitively normal older adults with preclinical AD [26]. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in driving performance are evident in preclinical AD. However, these studies did not explicitly examine the effect of race on driving performance.

Emerging studies are beginning to examine the effect of race and ethnicity in AD [27] because African Americans have a two-fold increased risk of AD compared their Caucasian counterparts [13]. African Americans have significant barriers with regards to access, diagnosis, treatment, and utilization of medical care [28]. Barriers are associated with factors like discrimination, and stress [29], which lead to cumulative disadvantage throughout the life course, and have particularly harmful outcomes among older African Americans [30, 31]. A study of African American women using telomere length as a biological aging marker showed that perceived stress and poverty aged African American women prematurely [32]. This evidence suggests social forces result in shorter life expectancies among African Americans compared to their Caucasian counterparts [33]. When it comes to transportation, African Americans express greater concerns for finding alternative transportation options as they age compared to Caucasians [34]. A systematic review examining differences in driving decline among community dwelling older adults found that African Americans have a greater risk for driving and mobility reduction, and driving cessation compared to Caucasian Americans [35]. Assessing race differences in driving is a critical step to identifying how individual differences are related to early changes in this functional activity. In this study, we examined both cross-sectional and longitudinal differences between African Americans and Caucasians on driving performance and behavior, and secondary analyses controlled for AD biomarkers on driving outcomes.

Materials and Methods

Design and Participants

Participants were enrolled in longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Washington University School of Medicine. Participants are required to have a collateral source accompany them—an individual who knows him or her well, which may be a friend, spouse, child or extended family member. Annual Knight ADRC assessments include a medication review and health history, neuropsychological and clinical assessments, and direct questioning concerning daily activities, skills, and factors that may jeopardize safety. Due to cost and participant burden, biomarker testing (CSF and imaging) is complete every two to three years. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was used to evaluate cognitive function and dementia severity [36]. Participants in this study were co-enrolled in a longitudinal study assessing preclinical AD and driving performance (R01: AG043434; AG056466). Inclusion criteria required participants be age 65 years or older, willing to take part in baseline AD biomarkers, be driving on average once per week or more, and be cognitively normal as defined by a score of 0 on the CDR. For this study, baseline testing was defined as the first time a data logger was installed and the closest corresponding clinical testing date. Amyloid imaging and CSF biomarker data were merged to the closest clinical testing date as long as the date of biomarker acquisition occurred within three years prior and six months ahead of the participant’s data logger installation date. Follow-up testing was defined as participants who completed the same clinical measures and annual road test on at least one additional occasion. The Washington University Human Research Protection Office approved study protocol, consent documents, and questionnaires. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and their collateral source. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture hosted at Washington University.

Clinical and neuropsychological assessment

Experienced clinicians integrate information from a neurological examination and interviews with the participant and a knowledgeable collateral source to derive a CDR [36]. Throughout the semi-structured interview, the clinician queries the participant and the collateral source regarding whether or not there has been a change in memory, thinking, and behavior. With the participant serving as his/her own control, the CDR probes change across six different domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The CDR reflects whether or not a person has dementia, and if so, the severity of the dementia. Normal cognition is indicated by a 0 on the CDR, with CDRs of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 representing very mild dementia, mild dementia, moderate dementia, and severe dementia, respectively. Participants also complete a number of neuropsychological testing measures. Data on cognitive functioning were examined from the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [37], Trail Making Test A and B [38], Animal Naming [39], and the Selective Reminding Test containing the Free Recall subtest (SRTFREE) [40].

Amyloid Imaging

Participants complete positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to determine amyloid burden using either Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) or florbetapir (F-AV-45) radioligands in a Biograph mMR 124 scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Dynamic PET imaging was conducted with a Siemens Biograph PET-CT scanner in three-dimensional mode after intravenous administration of PiB or florbetapir. The images were reconstructed on a 128×128×63 matrix (2.12×2.12×2.43 mm) using filtered back-projection. Participants also complete a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam in a 3 Tesla, which was segmented using FreeSurfer 5.1 (Martinos Center, Boston, MA). Visual inspection of the automated segmentation results was performed for quality assurance purposes in all datasets. Correction was done when necessary according to the FreeSurfer manual (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/). Regional target-to reference intensity ratio or standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was estimated with the cerebellum cortex used as the default reference point. Established SUVR cutoffs were used for florbetapir (≥1.219) and PiB (≥1.31) to indicate amyloid PET positivity [41, 42].

CSF

Analytes β-amyloid42 (Aβ42), tau, and phosphorylated tau181 (ptau181) levels were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) (INNOTEST; Fujirebio [formerly Innogenetics], Ghent, Belgium). Methods were described in prior studies[43, 44]. Values of Aβ42 to define amyloid status (positive vs negative) were determined using assay- and date-specific cutoffs that accounted for assay drift over the years, as a result, there is not a single cutoff for Aβ42 [45]. Prior cutoffs that distinguished individuals with very mild dementia (CDR 0.5) from those who are cognitively normal (CDR 0) were used for tau (339 pg/mL) and ptau181 (67 pg/mL) [46]. A lower level of Aβ42 is a marker of amyloid plaques, while higher levels of tau and ptau181 reflect tau-related neuronal injury.

Driving behavior: Driving Real World In-Vehicle Evaluation System (DRIVES)

Participants had a DRIVES chip plugged into their personal vehicle in order to capture, store and transmit data every time a vehicle is driven. This chip (G2 Tracking Device™, Model 860: Azuga Inc, San Jose, California) plugs into the onboard diagnostics port and samples data at the 30-second interval. The DRIVES methodology has been published [47, 48]. Data on driving behavior were available from July 1, 2015, to April 30, 2019 and collected as participants drove throughout the continental United States. Since the majority of participants were recruited in the greater St. Louis metropolitan area, most driving occurred in the Midwest. Daily data were processed, further compiled into months as a marker of time to simplify data analyses and examined as a mean per month. Data were aggregated and analyzed in R (version 3.4.2) and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC.). Variables of interest derived from the DRIVES included miles driven, trips taken, number of aggressive events (sudden acceleration, speeding, hard braking), and trips with any aggressive driving behavior. Raw numbers were converted to rates (mean trips) to reduce exposure bias for those participants who drove less.

Driving Performance: Road test

Participants complete the Washington University Road Test (WURT) [49, 16, 18], a 13-mile route road test progressing from a closed parking lot into light traffic, and then into more heavy traffic situations. A driving evaluator in the front seat provided turn-by-turn directions and evaluated the participant’s driving performance, rendering a rating of pass (no errors), marginal (some errors) or fail (many errors) at the end of the test [18]. The evaluator was a contracted driving instructor and was blinded to all data concerning the preclinical AD status. If a participant received a fail rating, a geriatrician on the study team reviewed the office testing and clinical data to provide feedback to the participant. If the participant consented, the testing information along with any new medical condition were sent to their primary care physician for follow up.

Self-report behavior: Driving habits

Participants completed the driving habits questionnaire (DHQ), a self-report measure of their driving behavior over the past year [50]. The 30-item questionnaire included exposure/frequency of travel to various destinations along with estimated miles, whether their vehicle is shared and who drives more regularly to specific destinations, perceived difficulty with common driving scenarios (e.g. rain, interstates, night, rush-hour), and finally traffic citation and crashes over the past year. Participant’s self-report of driving behaviors via the DHQ has been shown to have moderate agreement with actual driving behavior captured via in-vehicle chip [51]. Specific DHQ variables included number of self-reported total number of miles driven per week, the total number of trips taken per week, average miles per trip, the total number of places visited per week, the participant’s average difficulty driving, and a measure of the participant’s driving range or “space”. In order to compute these variables, participants had to have non-missing data for each component of the subscale.

Statistical analysis

The frequency and distribution of study variables were examined for outliers. Clinical, biomarker, and neuropsychological data were merged for each participant based on those that occurred closest in time to the installation of the DRIVES chip. Urban versus rural residence was determined based on self-reported zip code. A vascular risk factor composite (0–5) was computed based on baseline data collected from several variables indicating yes/no for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, heart disease, and history of smoking. Heart disease was endorsed if a participant had a history of atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest/heart attack, angioplasty, cardiac bypass, or congestive heart failure. Unadjusted analyses examining differences between African Americans and Caucasian Americans on the DHQ/DRIVES variables were compared through t-tests for continuous variables, chi-square tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for data with non-normal distributions. Similar unadjusted analyses examined group differences on cognitive performance via neuropsychological tests (MMSE, Trails A &amp; B, Animal Fluency, SRTFREE). For cross-sectional baseline analyses with the DHQ, generalized linear models were used to examine differences between race, adjusting for age, sex, and years of education. Survival analyses using Kaplan Meier curves (Log-Rank test) examined time to receiving a marginal or fail rating on the road test and required baseline along with at least one follow up road test. Similarly, Cox proportional hazards model were conducted while controlling for age, sex, and education. Linear mixed models were used to assess differences on 11 DRIVES variables between African Americans and Caucasians, while adjusting for follow up months, age, education, and years of education. Slopes represented change across months. To examine the effect of preclinical AD status on the DRIVES outcomes, the prior model was re-run with each biomarker (positive/negative) as a covariate to determine if race was a significant predictor. Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05. Loess curves plotted driving outcomes as a function of race and were limited to twenty-four months for presentation. All analyses were completed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Data for the DHQ, DRIVES and demographic variables were available for 177 older adults, with 34 African Americans and 143 Caucasians. Processed amyloid imaging data were available for 110 Caucasians and 24 African Americans, while CSF data were available for 115 Caucasians and 22 African Americans. Baseline road test data was available for the entire sample but there were only 107 Caucasians and 22 African Americans with baseline and at least one follow-up data point. Participants in the study averaged in their early 70s, had an average of 16 years of education, and a majority resided in urban areas (Table 1). There was no statistically significant difference by race in age, education, sex, urban residence, Apolipoprotein ε4 status or vascular risk factors. Compared to African Americans, there were more Caucasians with elevated CSF tau and amyloid imaging. Baseline neuropsychological testing indicated that while there was no group difference in performance on Animal Fluency and SRTFREE, there were statistically significant differences on the MMSE total score such that African Americans had slightly lower scores and longer time on Trails B but were not clinically significant.

Group differences in self-reported driving behavior were observed in the results of generalized linear models (Table 2). Older African American drivers reported statistically significantly fewer trips, visiting fewer places, having a smaller driving space and having less difficulty driving compared to Caucasians. Comparison of baseline performance on the road test indicated no differences in receiving a marginal or fail rating. Unadjusted analyses of road test performance using the Kaplan Meier curve was not statistically significant for race (Figure 1; p = 0.065). A Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for age, sex, and education did find race (p = 0.042) to be a statistically significant predictor in the model (Table 3).

Finally, the data captured from the DRIVES chip was available for 43 months with different lengths of follow-up across participants due to rolling enrollment. There were differences on six DRIVES chip outcomes based on the y-intercepts or baseline measurements (Table 4). African Americans had more mean trips during the night and fewer during the day, made more trips per month, drove more days in a month, and drove more hours in a month compared to Caucasians. There were eight differences in slopes across groups (Table 5). Compared to Caucasians, African Americans showed a greater decrease in the rate of change over time in mean trips with some aggression, speeding, and sudden acceleration but drove more at night, miles, trips, days and hours per month (Figure 2). When AD biomarkers were added as covariates into the mixed models (Table 6), the effect of race remained for a majority of the outcomes except for night driving (n.s. for CSF Aβ42 and ptau181) and hard braking (significant for all biomarker models).

DISCUSSION

In this cognitively normal sample of older adults, we found that there were cohort differences between African Americans and Caucasians in both driving performance and behavior. Self-reported driving behavior suggests that African Americans take fewer trips, visit fewer places, have a smaller driving space and perceive less difficulty driving compared to Caucasians. After adjusting for age, education and sex, African American older drivers seemed to experience faster decline in driving performance as reflected on the road test rating. Most notably, daily driving behavior (Table 5) revealed African Americans demonstrated reduced driving activity (miles per month) and reduced unsafe driving behaviors (aggression/hard braking/speeding) over time. Importantly, baseline demographic variables like age, education, sex, primary residence, and vascular risk factors were not statistically different by race.

These preliminary results partially affirm prior findings from the literature on driving outcomes among older adults where African Americans faced a greater risk of driving decline and mobility restriction [52–56]. African American participants self-reported having a smaller driving space compared to Caucasians. The driving data captured in this study using the DRIVES chip showed that African Americans’ daily driving behavior changed at a faster rate when compared to Caucasians, as highlighted by changes in the average number of miles and trips made per month (Figure 2). In addition, there was also a decrease in the mean trips with speeding and some aggression in daily driving behavior. While these variables reflect positive changes in safety behavior, the underlying change may reflect a reduction in driving. This pattern of driving reduction behavior follows a trend in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and dementia where the driver knowingly or unknowingly self-regulates their behavior leading to reduction over time [59]. We also found that African American participants had slightly lower scores on the MMSE and were slower to complete the Trail-Making B test. Reaction time and ability to switch between multiple tasks are required to safely operate a vehicle, thus impairments in these processes may impact a driver’s self-efficacy or confidence to drive.

A recent systematic review examined racial and ethnic differences among older adults over the past two decades and found only four out of 19 studies in the review explicitly focused on race and ethnicity in their analyses [35]. The majority of the studies in the systematic review that treated race as a covariate in the analyses did not find a statistically significant difference in driving outcomes between races. To our knowledge, no prospective study has longitudinally and directly examined racial differences between African Americans and Caucasian older adults using a self-reported driving questionnaire, assessment of driving performance via road test and real time collection of daily driving behavior. Of the three types of driving assessment, the DRIVES chip’s collection of daily driving behavior not only provided more objective data but also effectively demonstrated whether there was change over time between African Americans and Caucasians. This study joins a cadre of emerging research using naturalistic methodologies to examine changes in daily behavior to predict decline, crashes and cessation among older adults with or without cognitive impairments [59–61].

Our prior work in a sample (n=129) of cognitively normal older adults found that those with preclinical AD (CSF and PET amyloid) had a higher number of errors on the road test [24]. Additionally, longitudinal assessment of driving performance in the same sample (n=104) demonstrated that older adults with preclinical AD (CSF tau/Aβ42, ptau181/ Aβ42 and PET amyloid) were faster to receive a marginal or fail rating on the road test [62]. There were no differences in self-reported driving behavior (DHQ) between those with and without preclinical AD. In this study, there were group differences in CSF tau and amyloid imaging where African Americans were less likely to have elevated biomarkers. While this conflicts with the elevated risk of AD that has been reported for African Americans [13], two recent biomarker studies demonstrated the same findings between the effects of race on CSF tau and also ptau181 among cognitively normal older adults [63, 64]. While the relationship between race and CSF ptau181 was not significant in this study, African Americans had lower values compared to Caucasians. Studies have established that approximately a third of cognitively normal older adults will be positive for preclinical AD biomarkers [65]. For African Americans participants in this study, 8% were positive for amyloid imaging and 18–32% for the CSF analytes. These were higher for Caucasian participants where 28% were positive for amyloid imaging and 33–47% for CSF analytes. This discrepancy in prevalence estimates may be a result of specific cut-offs that were based on largely Caucasian cohorts.

There are several limitations to this study. In this prospective, longitudinal study, the sample of African American participants was considerably smaller than that of their Caucasian counterparts and a power analysis was not completed. While secondary analyses in linear mixed models controlled for each AD biomarker, the group effect of biomarker positivity and race could not be examined due to insufficient data to statistically disentangle the effect of race and preclinical AD on the driving outcomes. Compared to baseline road test performance data, only 22 African Americans and 107 Caucasians had baseline and at least one follow-up road test. Disproportionate sample sizes between African American and Caucasians using AD biomarkers are noted even with larger samples [64] and is likely a result of recruitment practices and selection bias associated with biomarker studies [66, 67]. Additional follow-up data with a more robust sample size on the road test is required to discern whether there is an effect of race in driving performance. We did not examine traffic citations or crashes as reported by law enforcement or Department of Motor Vehicles in relation to decline in daily driving behavior.

African American older adult drivers seem to experience greater change in daily driving and decline in performance as measured on a road test. It is unclear whether the increase risk for AD among African Americans is based solely on molecular biomarkers or risk factors and conditions that may impact instrumental activities of daily living like driving. Future research on driving and aging should include a larger sample of African Americans with processed biomarker data, examine spatial differences in driving area, life space, health and comorbidity, social forces like access to/quality of education and healthcare, stigma, discrimination, perceived stress and negative-life events.
