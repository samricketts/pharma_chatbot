Epigenetic modifications are emerging as major players in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders and susceptibility to acute brain injury. DNA and histone modifications act together with noncoding RNAs to form a complex gene expression machinery that adapts the brain to environmental stressors and injury response. These modifications influence cell-level operations like neurogenesis and DNA repair to large, intricate processes such as brain patterning, memory formation, motor function and cognition. Thus, epigenetic imbalance has been shown to influence the progression of many neurological disorders independent of aberrations in the genetic code. This review aims to highlight ways in which epigenetics applies to several commonly researched neurodegenerative diseases and forms of acute brain injury as well as shed light on the benefits of epigenetics-based treatments.

INTRODUCTION

Epigenetics are regulatory mechanisms that modulate gene expression without changing the genetic code. Epigenetics represent interactions between genes and the environment providing a connection between nutrition, toxins, medications, stress and cellular physiology.1–3 The concept of epigenetics was first described by Conrad Waddington in 1940’s with DNA methylation and has since been shown to encompass transcriptional regulation by histone modifications and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as well as post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs).4–8 Epigenetic alterations are involved in neurodevelopmental processes such as brain patterning, neural stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis and has been implicated in many diseases of the brain.9 Epigenetics can significantly increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to brain damage as well as identify targets for efficient therapeutic targeting to promote neuronal survival. This review discusses the epigenetic targets for both chronic and acute conditions that lead to significant neuronal death and neurological dysfunction including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s Disease (HD), epilepsy, stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI).

EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS

DNA Methylation:

DNA methylation (addition of a methyl group to cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine; 5-mC) is the most studied epigenetic mechanism implicated in gene regulation.10, 11 This usually occurs in stretches of dense CG dinucleotide repeats known as CpG islands that when methylated often lead to gene silencing by interfering with the ability of transcription factors to bind (Fig. 1).3, 12, 13 DNA methylation is mediated by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Methyl groups donated by S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) are added to CpG islands by DNMT3a and DNMT3b and maintained throughout successive cell generations by DNMT1.6, 14–16 DNMTs are highly expressed in the embryonic nervous system as well as post-mitotic neurons and glia where they facilitate synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and DNA repair.9, 10, 17, 18 In addition, methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBD) like MeCP2 can be recruited to 5-mC and play a role in gene regulation by mediating histone modifications and gene silencing.10, 19–21 The CNS shows the highest prevalence of DNA methylation of all organs which is thought to be involved in neurodevelopment, cognitive processes and aging.6, 22 In recent years, it has been shown that 5-mC patterning is strongly associated with aging and mortality.23 Thus, DNA methylation age (DNAm age) may be used as an estimation of biological age, a measure of an individual’s physiological health.24, 25 DNAm age has been proposed as a biomarker for predicting aging-associated brain disorders such as cognitive decline, dementia and AD.23, 26

DNA hydroxymethylation:

The family of ten-eleven translocase dioxygenases (TETs) oxidize 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC).27–29 Similar to 5-mC, 5-hmC is also highly enriched in the brain where it is predominantly found in neurons.30, 31 Contrary to 5-mC, 5-hmC is often concentrated at euchromatin and is associated with transcriptional activation.32–34 The TET enzymes are recruited to methylated CpGs where they have been shown to inhibit methyltransferase interaction, hinder MeCP2, and promote demethylation by further oxidizing 5-hmC to yield an unmethylated DNA through base excision repair.35–38 In the CNS, 5-hmC plays a role in DNA repair, synaptic plasticity and neuronal aging.39

Histone modifications:

Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, consist of DNA wrapped around histones that are essential for DNA structure. Histone organization can influence gene expression by affecting the architecture of promoters and the availability of DNA to transcription factors.10, 40, 41 Histones can undergo various epigenetic modifications including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, citrullination and ADP-ribosylation.12 Of these, the roles of histone methylation and acetylation in CNS disorders have been studied in detail. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) catalyze methylation using SAM as a donor on the amino acid side-chains of histones 3 and 4 (H3 and H4).6, 42 The degree, symmetry, and location of histone methylation dictates whether a gene is going to be expressed or suppressed (Fig. 2).43,44 Methylated histones do not change the overall shape of chromatin, but facilitate the recruitment of additional proteins that regulate gene expression.6, 42 Dysregulation of histone methylation has been linked to brain aging and neurological diseases.45 Histones are acetylated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) which results in gene activation due to electrostatic reduction between histones and DNA leading to a relaxed state euchromatin (Fig. 3).6, 46–49 Histone deacetylation mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs) and sirtuin deacetylases (SIRTs) lead to tightly wound chromatin and suppression of gene expression.6, 47, 48 HDACs are implicated in axon growth, oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity and cognition.50–57 Overall, epigenetic mechanisms that include DNA methylation and histone modifications, together with other proteins like MBDs, regulate gene expression in a highly dynamic manner in normal physiologic states and pathologic conditions.9, 16

Non-Coding RNA:

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are functional RNA molecules that are not translated into proteins, and instead regulate the expression of genes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. The epigenetic-related ncRNAs include micro, circular, short-interfering, PIWI-interacting, and long non-coding RNA, among others.51 Of these ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the most studied in relation to their epigenetic roles in diseases of the brain.

MicroRNA (miRNA) act post-transcriptionally on messenger RNA (mRNA), binding to their 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) and regulating gene expression by degradation or silencing of transcripts.7, 52–55 These 20–25 nucleotide long species, of which over 2000 have been classified, undergo splicing by Drosha and Dicer56 before individually acting on as many as 1000 target genes.9, 53 The ability of a single miRNA to act upon multiple genes produces an incredibly complex epigenetic environment, providing many therapeutic opportunities for human disease. In the CNS, miRNAs are important for neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity and neurorepair mechanisms.57–59

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), RNA transcripts containing more than 200 nucleotides, are highly expressed in the human brain.60 While the biological function of most lncRNAs remains to be elucidated, lncRNAs have been shown to play a role within chromatin remodeling, often guiding other modifying proteins to specific histones or gene sites and thereby influencing gene expression.8, 45, 61, 62 In addition, lncRNA may come in the form of antisense transcripts, functionally masking genes and preventing degradation of their sequences by miRNA.61, 63 LncRNAs are important in normal brain development and function, while aberrant lncRNA expression has been implicated in neurological disorders.64–69

EPIGENETICS AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES

Alzheimer’s disease

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disease marked by the aggregation of proteins amyloid-beta (Aβ42) and phosphorylated tau leading to extracellular plaques and intracellular tangles in the brain.56, 70, 71 These plaques and tangles are accompanied by neuronal loss, dysregulation of microtubule assembly, apoptosis, and brain atrophy.56, 72, 73 Interestingly, &lt;5% of AD cases are early onset/familial and can be accounted for by common variants.56, 70, 74 This indicates the possible mediation of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of AD.

The amyloid-β plaques fundamental to AD pathogenesis are caused by the dysregulation of the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP).75–77 Post-mortem studies with brain tissue from humans that died of natural causes showed that 13 cytosine residues in the promoter region of APP are differentially methylated with age.78 Additionally, those patients older than 70 showed ~50% reduction in methylation at these cytosines.78 Increased methylation of APP in AD subjects has been shown to increase APP expression leading to aggregation of the neurotoxic Aβ42 indicating the importance of differential methylation patterning in AD pathogenesis.79

Presilin1 (PS1) and β-secretase (BACE) are integral in the processing of APP and their dysregulation leads to the aberrant Aβ42 plaques observed in AD.80 PS1 and BACE methylation is highly dependent on SAM as methyl donor and severe decrease in SAM levels correlates with AD.81 In neuroblastoma cell lines, vitamin B12 and folate deprivation induces PS1 and BACE that are reversed by SAM.82, 83 In transgenic mice that overexpress human APP and display Aβ plaque deposition, SAM supplementation reduced the activity of β- and γ-secretase, decreased Aβ production and plaques, restored normal levels of tau phosphorylation and improved spatial memory.84, 85 These studies are supported by a clinical trial where increased plasma levels of SAM were correlated with decreased Aβ−40 and PS1 mRNA levels in newly diagnosed AD patients.86

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) regulates Aβ42 clearance and hence it is considered as an important risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD).87 APOE has a non-classical (CpG-poor) promoter and hence its regulation is complex.88 The APOE haplotypes ε2–4 has been shown to be differentially correlated with LOAD risk.88 For example, APOE4 confers more risk than APOE3, but not all APOE4 carriers develop LOAD and many LOAD patients are not carriers of APOE4.87, 89–91 Furthermore, significant hypomethylation of the 2 APOE CpG sub-regions in the frontal lobe of Lewy body dementia and AD patients have been identified in post-mortem brain studies.92, 93 These studies indicate a role for methylation of the APOE promoter as an epigenetic regulator of LOAD.

Histone acetylation levels were reported to be markedly decreased in both AD transgenic mice and AD human brains.94, 95 In AD transgenic mice, HDAC2 was shown to be induced and treatment with HDAC2-specific inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) improved learning and memory.96, 97 Treatment with another HDAC inhibitor sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) also decreased the number of phosphorylated tau tangles and enhanced cognitive function in transgenic AD mice.98 Furthermore, HDAC6 knockout mice showed improved learning and memory and protection against Aβ42-induced disruption of mitochondrial trafficking, which is related to amyloid pathology.99, 100

The majority of identified AD-related miRNAs are involved in regulation of APP. Bioinformatics analyses have revealed several putative APP 3’UTR miRNA binding sites that have been validated in vitro. MiR-16 and miR-101 were shown to target APP and reduce Aβ-induced cytotoxicity in both PC12 cells and hippocampal neurons.101–103 In human cell lines, several miRNAs including miR-106, miR-520c, miR-20a, miR-17–5p, miR-106b, miR-17, miR-153, miR-147, miR-644, miR-655, miR-323–3p and miR-20a have been shown to bind to APP and repress APP expression.104–106 MiR-195, miR-339–5p and miR-107 are reduced in the brain tissue of AD disease patients and have also been shown to directly target and reduce the APP processor BACE1 in human cell lines and mouse cell culture studies.107–110 Furthermore, overexpression of miR-195 was shown to reduce Aβ toxicity in neuroblastoma cells.107 BACE1 is also targeted by miR-485–5p and miR-485–5p overexpression returned BACE1 to its non-pathological levels in HEK293T cells.61

Several studies have also identified the role of miRNAs in APP regulation both in vitro and in vivo. For example, the miR-29 family (miR29a, −29b, −29c) is downregulated in AD brains and has been shown to target the 3’-UTR of the APP processor BACE1 in human and mouse cell lines.111–113 In vitro, suppression of miR-29a and miR-29b in human cells increases production of Aβ.111 Hippocampal injection of miR-29c mimic in SAMP8 mice decreased Aβ and improved learning and memory compared to untreated control mice.112 In APP/PS1 mice, reductions in miR-135, miR-200b and miR-429 were observed in the hippocampus. MiR-200b and miR-429 were shown to target APP and reduce APP expression while miR-135 targeted and decreased BACE1.114 MiR-124 is also a negative regulator of BACE1 and lentiviral overexpression of miR-124 in the dentate gyrus of APP/PS1 mice reduced of apoptotic and autophagy markers and ameliorated cognitive deficits.115

The miR-132/212 cluster has been shown to be downregulated in tauopathy-related diseases including AD.116, 117 Knockout of miR-132/212 in mice led to an increase in tau expression, phosphorylation and aggregation.118 Another study showed that miR-132/212 knockout mice display significant deficits in cognitive function.119 MiR-132 was shown to directly target and decrease tau mRNA and treatment with a miR-132 mimic restored tau and improved memory function in 3xTg-AD mice.118 Downregulation of miR-132 was most significantly observed in neurons showing hyper-phosphorylation of tau in the brains of late stage AD patients.120, 121 Furthermore miR-132 downregulation has been shown to correlate with cognitive decline in patients with AD.118 MiR-219 also targets and represses tau synthesis and decreased levels of miR-219 were also observed in the human AD brain.122 In a Drosophila model that produces human tau, reductions in miR-219 were associated with exacerbation of tau toxicity, linking this miRNA to AD-related pathology.122

The dysregulation of miRNAs has not only been shown to occur within the brain, but also within bio fluids such as serum, plasma, and CSF. A large push to develop AD detection methods has led to miRNA profiling within serum123–127, plasma125, 128–130, CSF125, 130–135, exosomes132, 134–136, extracellular fluid137, and PBMCs138 of humans and AD animal models. For example, one study showed that miR-135 was reduced in the blood of patients with mild cognitive impairment and miR-135 and miR-200b levels were decreased in CSF of individuals with dementia of Alzheimer’s type (DAT) group.114 In blood samples obtained from AD patients, both miR-29c and BACE1 expression were increased.112 Recently, Kumar et al. has developed a biomarker technique allowing AD patients to be distinguished from control patients with 95% specificity by hsa-miR-191–5p and hsa-miR-15b-5p signatures within plasma.139 Another study developed a 16 miRNA exosomal serum panel that predicts AD with 87% sensitivity and 77% specificity.137 Table 1 outlines the therapeutic potential of miRNAs and the other epigenetic regulators discussed in AD.

Bioinformatics studies have begun to elucidate the roles of lncRNAs in AD. In postmortem brain samples, the expression of hundreds of lncRNAs are significantly changed in AD patients versus age-matched controls in AD-related regions of the brain such as the hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex and cortex.140–142 Gene ontological analysis identified significantly altered lncRNAs associated with mRNAS involved in protein ubiquitination, amyloid-β clearance, neural communication, electron transport chain, metabolic processes and cholesterol homeostasis.140–142 When neurofibrillary tangles were sampled, lncRNAs associated with development and morphogenesis of the neural tube and neural crest were significantly changed.143 Microarray analyses performed in rodent models of AD have similarly shown extensive changes in lncRNA expression.144, 145 While these bioinformatics studies revealed that several lncRNAs play roles in AD pathology, recent reports have identified Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT1) as a key lncRNA in AD progression.141 Downregulation of NEAT1 in hippocampal tissue of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice was observed in the early stage of disease progression.146 Reduced levels of NEAT1 prevented clearance of Aβ by inhibiting expression of endocytosis-related genes.146 Alternatively, in vitro models of AD performed with mouse brain tissue or neuroblastoma cells have shown upregulation of NEAT1.147, 148 Knockdown of NEAT1 reduced Aβ-induced toxicity, apoptosis and promotion of p-Tau. Furthermore, NEAT1 was shown to reduce miR-107 and miR-124, thereby increasing BACE1.148 Another lncRNA that modulates miRNA efficacy is BACE1-AS, an anti-sense transcript that is upregulated in AD and expressed alongside BACE1. BACE-AS competes with the miR-485–5p binding site and prevents miR-485–5p from degrading the BACE1 transcript.61, 149 Dysregulated expression of both BACE-AS and miR-485–5p have been observed in RNA samples from the brains of AD patients.61

Parkinson’s disease

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting over 600,000 Americans, a number expected to double by 2040.150 PD is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathways from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) to the striatum.6, 151, 152 The neurodegeneration of PD is marked by aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn), a synaptic protein leading to dopaminergic neuron failure and resulting in tremors, rigidity, and non-motor symptoms like dementia and depression.6, 151, 153 Levodopa (L-Dopa), an amino acid precursor to neurotransmitters, provides relief to the motor-based symptoms of PD; however, L-Dopa can lead to the involuntary movement disorder, tardive dyskinesia, and other drugs like it fail to treat the non-motor symptoms of the disease.6, 154 Therefore, potential PD treatments in the realm of epigenetics are currently being explored (Table 2).

Oligomerization and aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) is thought to be responsible for the onset of PD in humans.152 While phosphorylation and ubiquitination are known to promote α-syn aggregation, the precise mechanisms that control α-syn are still not known. Hypomethylation of the CpG2 (near intron 1) in the α-syn gene was shown in the blood, substantia nigra and putamen tissue samples of PD patients.155 This hypomethylation of the α-syn gene is thought to be responsible for increased levels of α-syn and correlate with age of onset of PD.156, 157 Furthermore, DNMT1 levels were shown to be decreased by ~50% that might be responsible for reduction in α-syn promoter methylation in PD brain samples.158 There has been evidence showing that α-syn mediates the sequestration of DNMT1 in neuronal cells causing its own hypomethylation in a feed-forward mechanism.158 Thus, epigenetic control by methylation of the α-syn promoter might be a factor responsible for PD onset as well as progression.

Many studies showed that histone acetylation also plays a significant role in PD pathogenesis. In α-syn overexpressing cells, α-syn binds to H3 leading to hypoacetylation of H3.159 Treatment with HDAC inhibitors sodium butyrate and SAHA reversed this and rescued cells from α-syn toxicity.159 Furthermore, H3 deacetylation inhibitors valproic acid (VPA), sodium butyrate, Trichostatin A (TSA) and SAHA protected the neuronal cells following MPTP treatment, a drug that produces a neurotoxin up taken by dopaminergic neurons and causes parkinsonism features.160, 161 In an MPTP mouse model of PD, H3 acetylation was observed to be upregulated and treatment with Levodopa (L-DOPA) reversed this effect.162 However, in primate PD models H3 acetylation was observed to be downregulated upon L-DOPA administration.162 Hence, HDAC inhibitors are promising to understand PD pathology, but the mechanistic role of histone acetylation in PD is still not completely clear. Histone acetylation has also been explored in the pesticide exposure-induced model of PD. In rat mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, pesticides dieldrin and paraquat that are known to cause PD-like symptoms promoted H3 and/or H4 hyperacetylation.163 Furthermore, CREB-binding protein mediated histone hyperacetylation led to dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis that was rescued by the HAT inhibitor anacardic acid.163, 164

Familial and sporadic PD can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2).165 It was previously shown that mutant LRRK2 leads to miRNA-induced transcriptional repression by negatively regulating Argonaute-2 of the RISC complex and by antagonizing let-7 and miR-184 in Drosophila.166 In mammalian PD models, LRKK2 has been shown to cause dysregulation of GTPase activity167, autophagy168, and actin stabilization.169 Cho et al. found that despite increased expression of LRRK2 protein in PD patients, LRRK2 mRNA levels are not significantly altered, leading them to investigate post-transcriptional modifications.170 Screening for miRNAs with target sites near the LRRK2 3’UTR, revealed that miR-205 is disproportionately downregulated in PD frontal cortex. Overexpression of miR-205 suppressed LRRK2 protein expression, and inhibition of miR-205 increased LRRK2 in primary neurons and dopaminergic MN9D cell lines.170, 171 Increased miR-205 levels were shown to inhibit defects in neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons of mice expressing mutant forms of LRRK2.170

SNCA is also post-transcriptionally regulated by several miRNAs. MiR-7 has been shown to reduce levels of α-syn by 30% while miR-153 reduced levels of α-syn by 19% in primary neurons.172 A synergistic effect was observed with overexpression of both miR-7 and miR-153 which reduced α-syn levels by 46% in primary neurons.172 In another study, miR-7 and miR-153 overexpression was protective via mTOR and SAPK/JNK pathway preservation in cortical neurons exposed to MPP+.173 Furthermore, inhibition of miR-7 upregulated α-syn and miR-7 was shown to protect against cellular α-syn-mediated susceptibility to oxidative stress, proteasome impairment, and prevent cell death by targeting RelA in dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells.174, 175 MiR-155 was shown to play a key role in α-syn-induced inflammation and knockout of miR-155 reduced α-syn neurotoxicity in mice.176 Finally, eight miRNA, including hsa-miR-21 and hsa-miR-301b were shown to deregulate the chaperone mediated autophagy proteins (CMA), lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (LAMP-2A) and heat shock protein 70 (hsc70), each degraders of α-syn, resulting in increased aggregates in neuroblastoma cells.177

MiR-34b/c and the previously reported miR-7 have been implicated in mitochondrial function in PD and PD-related models. MiR-34b and miR-34c were downregulated in human brain tissue from PD patients in Braak stages 4 and 5.178 Correspondingly, decreased levels of miR-34b and miR-34c correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and increased α-syn aggregation in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells.178, 179 It has been proposed that miR-34b loss in PD patients leads to the characteristic upregulation of A2AR in the putamen observed in the disease.179 MiR-7 has also been shown to regulate mitochondrial protein expression, prevent ROS and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening following MPP+ exposure in neuroblastoma cells.180 Finally, miR-7 has been shown to target the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia, and a miR-7 mimic provided neuroprotection in Transgenic-α-syn mice subject to MPTP.181

Several other miRNAs involved in modulating PD pathology have been identified. For example, treatment with a miR-221 mimetic was shown to be protective against a 6-OHDA treatment model of PD in PC12 cells.182 Overexpression of miR-185 or miR-181c prevented MPTP-induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma or PC12 cells, respectively.183, 184 In a rotenone PD model of neuroblastoma cells, miR-384–5p inhibition reversed ER stress and attenuated apoptosis.185 Overexpression of miR-124 downregulated apoptotic and autophagic pathways to provide neuroprotection in both MPTP-treated mice models and MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells.186 Loss of miR-133b has been observed in the midbrain of PD patients and miR-133 was shown to regulate maturation and function of dopaminergic neurons through a feedback loop with Pitx3.187 MiR-16–1-mediated downregulation of hsp70 was shown to worsen aggregation of α-syn in transgenic neuroblastoma cells.188 Finally, hydrogen sulfide treatment was shown to protect MPTP-treated mice by increasing miR-135a- 5p, which represses rho-associated protein kinase 2, an enzyme that promotes neurodegeneration.189

Profiles of miRNAs expressed in the prefrontal cortex tissue190, SNpc191, exosomes of the CSF192, and serum193 of PD patients have revealed extensive dysregulation of miRNAs. CSF miRNA profiling was shown to distinguish PD patients from controls and also correlated with different stages of PD pathology.194, 195 Overlapping miRNAs identified in serum studies have implicated several miRNAs that may be key to PD pathogenesis including miR-29c, miR-221, and miR-214.196–199 The role of miR-29c has not been elucidated, but miR-221 has been shown to promote survival in human dopaminergic neuronal cells and loss of miR-214 increased alpha-synuclein expression in human neuroblastoma cells.200, 201 In plasma, a strategy combining k-Top Scoring Pairs algorithm of differentially expressed miRNA can predict PD with 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity.202

Several profiling studies have shown aberrations in lncRNA expression in the human PD brain and mouse models of PD providing a basis for biomarker research.203–208 The majority of the lncRNAs investigated in PD have been shown to modulate miRNAs. For example, HAGLROS was upregulated in MPTP-treated mice and MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells.208 HAGLROS was shown to sponge miR-100 and subsequent inhibition decreased apoptosis and autophagy both in vitro and in vivo through PI3K/Akt/mTOR regulation.209 P21 was upregulated in neuroblastoma cells subject to MPP+ and subsequent knockdown decreased ROS generation, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis.210 It was found that p21 exerts protective function through de-repression of miR-625 and thus upregulation of Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2).210 In addition, p21 promoted apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells by sponging miR-1277–5p and thereby increasing expression of α-syn.211 MALAT1 is increased in midbrains of MPTP-treated mice and was shown to suppress miR-205–5p, leading to a subsequent increase of LRRK2.171 Correspondingly, MALAT1 knockdown prevented apoptosis after MPP+ treatment in MN9D cells.171 In addition, β-asarone treatment has been shown to be protective in both in vitro and in vivo models of PD by downregulating MALAT1 expression.212

The small nucleolar host gene 1 (SNGH1) lncRNA was upregulated in MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells and exacerbated toxicity by sponging miR-15b-5p.213 Knockdown of SNGH1 or overexpression of miR-15b-5p abrogated ROS production and cell death in the same model.213 The protective role of miR-15b-5p was again shown through SNGH1 knockdown leading to less α-syn aggregation in neuroblastoma cells.214 SNGH1 silencing has been shown to act through other axes like miR-221/222 and CDKN1B/p27/mTOR to enhance autophagy and prevent cell death in MPTP-treated mice and MPP+-treated MN9D cells.215 Importantly, SNGH1 was also elevated in brains of PD patients and was shown to promote neuroinflammation by suppressing miR-7 and enhancing microglia and inflammasome activation in MPTP-treated mice.216

MPTP-treated mice and MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells were both shown to induce NEAT1 expression.217 Subsequent knockdown of NEAT1 suppressed autophagy in mice by stabilizing PINK 1.217 Importantly, NEAT1 was also increased in the substantia nigra of patients with PD and the neuroprotective drugs fenofibrate and simvastatin have been shown to require NEAT1 to prevent paraquat-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells.218 Alternatively, NEAT1 silencing was also shown to be protective by reducing apoptosis and inflammatory signaling in MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells by derepressing miR-124.219

The Urothelial Cancer Associated 1 (UCA1) lncRNA was highly expressed in MPTP-treated mice and MPP+-treated neuroblastoma cells, leading to increased SNCA expression.220 Knockdown of UCA1 decreased caspase-3 activity and apoptosis in the same cell model.220 Similarly, downregulation of UCA1 prevented inflammation and oxidative stress in a PD rat model induced by 6-hydroxydopamine injection (6-OHDA).221 MPTP treatment of neuroblastoma cells downregulated NORAD and subsequent overexpression protected against MPP+-mediated apoptosis, decreased ROS, and decreased lactose dehydrogenase activity.222 Finally, expression of the lncRNA HOTAIR has been shown to increase in both MPTP models of mice and MPP+ models of neuroblastoma cells along with a corresponding increase in LRRK2.66 Knockout of HOTAIR in the cellular model attenuated induced neurotoxicity.66

Huntington’s disease

Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a dominant, late-onset genetic disorder affecting 5–10 people of 100,000 globally.223, 224 In HD, CAG repeats form at exon 1 of the Huntingtin gene (HTT), producing the neurotoxic Huntingtin protein (mHTT) and resulting in neurodegeneration of GABAergic spiny striatal neurons.224–226 HD manifests in motor impairment and chorea, schizophrenia-like behavior and suicidal tendency, as well as changes in mood and judgement.224 HD patients undergo differing treatment depending on the course of the disease, and it is hopeful that altering gene expression through combinatorial approaches such as tacrine, moclobemide, and creatine will improve treatment options.227, 228 Several studies have revealed a role for epigenetic mechanisms in HD pathology, many of which display therapeutic potential (Table 3).

In post-mortem tissue from the frontal and parietal cortex of HD patients, a higher level of global methylation was observed compared to control patients.229 Cultured mouse striatal cells from knock-in embryos expressing full-length huntingtin (HTT) show methylation of promoters and thus down-regulation of several genes that control developmental processes, neuronal migration and cell signaling genes.230 A correlation between global cortex hypermethylation and age of disease onset in the cerebral cortex has been observed, although differential methylation at probed sites around HTT was not identified.231 Genome-wide reduction of 5-hmC has also been seen in a HD mouse model, particularly in the cerebral cortex and striatum.232 Differentially hydroxymethylated promoter regions in these animals correspond to Wnt/β-catenin/Sox pathway, axon guidance, GABA signaling and dopamine feedback, which are all implicated in HD pathology.232 Stimulation of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) has been shown to ameliorate neurodegeneration and several major HD symptoms in rodents.233, 234 However, A2AR levels are significantly reduced in the HD putamen of human brains potentially due to hypermethylation and decreased hydroxymethylation of the adenosine a2a receptor (ADORA2A) gene.235

HDAC inhibition is a major mechanism of neuroprotection in HD. Various chemical HDAC inhibitors such as SAHA, sodium butyrate, 4-PBA and TSA have been shown to ameliorate motor dysfunction, cognitive deficits or the neurodegenerative phenotype in transgenic C. elegans, Drosophila and mouse models of HD.236–242 Treatment with the HDAC inhibitor 4b was shown to reduce hypoacetylation of H3 and H4, and diminish transcriptional abnormalities caused by mutant HTT in the striatum, cortex and cerebellum of HD transgenic mice.243 The 4b treatment was additionally shown to improve motor function and decrease brain atrophy in HD mice.243 While chemical HDAC inhibition has proven to be effective in ameliorating HD deficits, studies employing genetic knockdown of various HDACs in HD are not clear. For example, knockout of HDAC4, HDAC6, or HDAC7 were not effective in ameliorating neurodegeneration in transgenic HD mouse models.244–246 Similarly, while HDAC3 chemical inhibition has been shown to have a therapeutic effect in HD, HDAC3 knockout was not effective in reducing transcriptional dysregulation or HTT aggregation in transgenic HD mice and increased nuclear HTT aggregates in HeLA and 293T cells expressing mutant HTT.241, 247, 248 Alternatively, RNA interference-mediated HDAC3 knockdown suppressed polyglutamine toxicity in a C. elegans model of HD using neuronal expression of mutant HTT with expanded polyglutamine repeats.239 These opposing results highlight the complexity of HDACs in HD as chemical inhibitors may target multiple HDACs, HDAC isoforms differ in target specificity and efficacy, and chemical and genetic inhibition have been shown to have differential compensatory mechanisms.249

Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) that is essential for striatal neuronal survival is severely reduced in the brain of HD patients.250–253 HTT is known to interact and recruit the repressor element-1 transcription factor (REST) complex (REST/coREST/Sin3A/HDAC1/HDAC2) to the cytosol which consequently allows BDNF gene expression.252, 253 A study assessing REST levels in brain tissues of HD patients found that cytoplasmic REST levels are reduced in neurons of the cortex and caudate of HD patients.254 Studies in mice have shown that the HTT mutation in HD causes the REST complex to accumulate in the nucleus, thereby silencing BDNF and contributing to neuronal death.253 In addition to BDNF, loss of several REST-controlled genes involved in neuronal maintenance have been observed in both the mouse and human HD brain.253 Since REST silencing occurs via HDAC-dependent chromatin remodeling, HDAC inhibitors that may also target REST activity may by therapeutically beneficial.

Differential expression of miRNAs has been observed in the brain and blood of HD patients and animal models of HD.255–260 MiR-9 was decreased in the cortices of HD patients and was shown to target REST and coREST in neuronal precursor cells.261 In a transgenic non-human primate model, miR-128 was downregulated from the time of birth and was shown to interact with HTT and huntingtin interacting protein 1 (HIP1).262 Other studies have implicated the miR-10b family which is upregulated in the serum and brain of HD patients.255, 263–265 In silico analysis revealed that miR-10b-5p targets BDNF, which displays reduced levels in HD leading to neuronal dysfunction.264 MiR-10b-5p expression in the prefrontal cortex has been correlated with HD age of onset in HD patients.263 This indicates that miR-10b-5p could serve as an important biomarker in HD treatment; however, it has not been examined in peripheral fluid.

Evidence of other miRNAs with potential involvement in HD pathology include miR-137, miR-148a and miR-214 which have been shown to directly target HTT and reduce HTT protein levels in HEK293T cells.266 In STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells, miR-214 was also responsible for the downregulation of β-catenin often seen in HD.267 MiR-196a has been identified as significantly upregulated in HD265 and bioinformatics analyses indicated it may target inflammation and apoptosis-related pathway.263, 268, 269 MiR-196a overexpression was shown to increase neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells269 and suppress Ran-binding protein 10 (RANBP10), a protein which is elevated in HD mice.270 MiR-196a also suppressed apoptosis in neural progenitor cells and differentiated neural cells in HD non-human primates.271 In STHdh(Q111)/Hdh(Q111) cells, increased levels of p53 led to downregulation of miR-146a.272 Subsequent overexpression of miR-146a attenuated cell cycle abnormalities and decreased apoptosis in the same cell model.273 Similarly, in the R6/2 mouse model, miR-34a-5p levels have been shown to decrease with increased p53 expression, although the relationship between p53 and miRNA expression has not been elucidated.274

Downregulation of miR-22 was observed in the brains of both YAC128 and R6/2 transgenic mice.257 In vitro, miR-22 has been shown to provide neuroprotection in multiple primary striatal and cortical cell models of HD including mHTT and 3-NP exposure by reducing caspase activation and apoptosis.275 MiR-132 overexpression in the striatum of R6/2 mice was neuroprotective and delayed disease progression despite having no effect on mutant HTT.276 MiR-27a overexpression in R6/2-derived neuronal stem cells decreased mHTT aggregates, potentially by upregulating multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1), a transporter of mHTT.277 Lastly, overexpression of an artificial miRNA targeting mHTT in sheep expressing human HD CAG repeat decreased HTT levels by 50–80% at 1 and 6 months following treatment.278 This study supports the therapeutic potential of miRNA modulation in the large animal brain.

One study identified the existence of a natural antisense HTT transcript (HTTAS), which manifests in two splice variants HTTAS_v1, containing exons 1 and 3, and HTTAS_v2, containing exons 2 and 3.279 Up to 50% loss of HTTAS_v1 has been observed in the human HD frontal cortex and depending upon levels of overexpression and HTTAS_v1 repeat length, HTT can be decreased by 20–90% in HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells.279 Multiple mouse models of HD have shown decreased levels of the lncRNA Abhd11os.280 Lentiviral-mediated overexpression of Abhd11os was neuroprotective, while knockdown of Abhd11os exacerbated mHTT toxicity.280 Other differentially expressed lncRNAs identified in cell and animal models are maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) and NEAT1.281–283 NEAT1 levels were increased in the brains of HD patients and R6/2 mice and NEAT1 overexpression in neuroblastoma cells was shown to protect against H2O2-induced oxidative stress.282 Similarly, NEAT1 overexpression protected neuroblastoma cells cotransfected with HTT expression plasmids from cytotoxicity.284 However, knockdown of NEAT1 or MEG3 was also shown to decrease mHTT aggregation and p53 expression in neuroblastoma cells281, indicating the roles of these lncRNAs in HD needs to be studied further.

EPIGENETICS AND ACUTE BRAIN INJURY

Ischemic Stroke

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide.10, 285 Ischemic stroke (cerebral ischemia) is caused by the blockage of blood flow to the brain and results in energy depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity and ultimately cell death. During the reperfusion phase, return of the blood supply introduces inflammatory factors and induces oxidative stress which then cause secondary brain damage.286–288 Following ischemia/reperfusion injury, the cells within the penumbra (the area surrounding the infarcted core) are destined to die; however, some if not all, have the ability to recover if given therapeutic intervention.289, 290 At this time, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is the only stroke medication approved for treatment.291, 292 TPA works to digest clots through the degradation of fibrin293, 294; however, no significant decrease in mortality has been shown after treatment and increased incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is linked to TPA.295 Recent studies showed that epigenetic changes play a significant role in modulating secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction following stroke and hence may represent much-needed potential stroke therapeutic targets (Table 4).

The contribution of DNA hypermethylation to poor outcomes after cerebral ischemia has been well characterized. After middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced focal ischemia in mice, levels of 5-mC were shown to be elevated in the striatum and cortex of mice.296 Heterozygous DNMT knockout mice or mice heterozygous for a mutant DNMT allele showed smaller infarcts after mild ischemic damage.296, 297 Furthermore, treatment with the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-dC or other demethylating agents protected wild-type rodents after focal ischemia.296, 298, 299 However, in a severe ischemic mouse model, DNMT expression was not increased nor were mice protected by DNMT gene deletion.296 Interestingly, genomic methylation has been shown to be better predictor of biological age and stroke outcome than chronological age.300, 301

Recent studies also evaluated the role of 5-hmC in post-stroke brain damage. Following MCAO in mice, 5-hmC increased quickly after reperfusion (by 5 min) and remained elevated up to 2 days of reperfusion following focal ischemia.32, 302 It was observed that the post-stroke induction of 5-hmC was mediated by TET3 in the peri-infarct region or TET2 in the whole brain.32, 302 Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of 5-hmC exacerbated ischemia/reperfusion injury, while TET activation via ascorbate enhanced the expression of protective genes, prevented degeneration, and improved motor function recovery after focal ischemia.302 A recent study in mice reported that 5-hmC is increased in the mitochondrial genome after focal ischemia where it may influence mitochondrial gene expression and ATP levels.303

Inhibition of histone deacetylation was shown to protect the brain after stroke. VPA administration prevented deacetylation of H3 and H4 and ameliorated hippocampal CA1 neuronal death after global ischemia in adult rats.304 Treatment with VPA or sodium butyrate or TSA was shown to inhibit microglial activation, downregulate nitric oxide synthase and upregulated heat shock proteins leading to improved behavioral outcomes and reduced infarct volume in a rats following permanent MCAO.305 Importantly, VPA and sodium butyrate were shown to be most beneficial when given at 3 to 6 h of reperfusion after focal ischemia in rodents indicating the translational potential of these drugs in stroke therapy.305 Administration of SAHA following transient MCAO in mice was shown to suppress ischemia-induced H3 deacetylation which led to decreased proinflammatory levels of cytokine IL1β and increased levels of the chaperone HSC70.306 SAHA treatment also decreased size of the infarction after transient MCAO.306 Pre- or post-stroke treatment with the HDAC inhibitor 4-PBA was also shown to reduce infarct volume significantly in a mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia.307 An in vitro study using white matter cells isolated from the mouse optic nerve showed that HDAC inhibitor treatment (SAHA or MS-275) before or after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) preserved white matter architecture and reduced excitotoxicity.308

Several rodent studies have shown that miRNAs are significantly altered within the brain after cerebral ischemia.309–311 Additional studies have identified a number of miRNAs involved in various aspects of stroke pathophysiology including excitotoxicity (miR-223, miR-107, miR-125b), oxidative stress (miR-23, miR-99), apoptosis (miR-21, miR-25, miR-15, miR-497, miR-29), edema (miR-29, miR-9, miR-375, miR-150, miR-130, miR-320) inflammation (miR-22, miR-203, miR-9, miR-132), neurogenesis (miR-17) and angiogenesis (miR-107, miR-376, miR-140).312 Several key miRNAs studied within the field of stroke are discussed in more detail below.

Both focal and permanent ischemia have been shown to reduce miR-424 expression in the plasma of stroke patients and within the blood and brain of rodents.313, 314 Overexpression of miR-424 was shown to reduce focal ischemia-induced oxidative stress and infarct in the mouse brain by increasing Nrf2 and MnSOD.314 In a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia, miR-424 overexpression reduced edema and inflammatory processes by inhibiting microglial activation.313 MiR-424 expression was increased in human endothelial cells subjected to hypoxia and promoted angiogenesis by stabilizing HIF-1α. In the plasma of stroke patients, miR-424 levels were upregulated in lymphocytes and neutrophils, which was negatively correlated with TNF-α, IL-10, and IGF-1 expression as well as infarct size.315 Several studies have shown that miR-124 is increased after stroke and delivery of a miR-124 mimetic confers neuroprotection in both transient MCAO and OGD models.316–318 MiR-124 was shown to promote angiogenesis and inhibit excitotoxicity, apoptosis, BBB damage, and inflammation through modulation of glutamate receptors319, 320, Notch signaling321, DNA repair protein Ku70322, REST inhibition, calpain reduction316, PI3K/AKT activation323, upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins317, and regulation of and M2-like microglia/macrophage activation318 in several in vitro and in vivo models of rodent cerebral ischemia. MiR-155 was shown to upregulate inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, IL-4, and IL-6 in mice324 and increase apoptosis through the Rheb/mTOR pathway in rats325 following focal ischemic injury. Inhibition of miR-155 significantly decreased infarction in mice following transient MCAO by increasing nitric oxide (NO) production and the expression of Notch1 and endothelial NO synthase.326, 327

While the miRNAs discussed above have shown consistent roles in animal models of cerebral ischemia, the impact of other key miRNAs is more complex. For example, following mouse transient focal ischemia, miR-181a increased within the infarcted region where it was shown to negatively regulate binding immunoglobulin protein (GRP78/HSPA5), a protein involved in ER function and inhibition of apoptosis.328, 329 However, within the penumbra, miR-181a expression decreased and positively regulated GRP78, implicating miR-181a in ischemic pathogenesis as well as ischemic recovery.328 The evidence thus far indicates that miR-181 inhibition is protective as it has been shown to reduce infarct and inflammation by decreasing glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in rodent models of cerebral ischemia.330–332 Similarly, miR-210 has been implicated in both protection and injury following cerebral ischemia. For example, miR-210 overexpression has been shown to upregulate BDNF levels, reduce neuronal apoptosis and improve neurological severity scores following transient focal ischemia in rats and mice.333, 334 However, both pre- and post-MCAO inhibition of miR-210 improved neurological outcomes by reducing inflammation following mouse transient MCAO.335

As with neurodegenerative disorders, a significant effort has been made to develop biomarker procedures that can identify stroke with minimal invasiveness. MiRNA profiles have been established in serum336–341, plasma342–346, whole blood347–349, exosomes350, and CSF.341 MiR-145339, 340, 348 and let-7e341, 347 were identified as key miRNAs in multiple profiling studies. Based off the miRNA let-7e in serum, Peng et al. was also able to predict acute stroke in patients with 73.4% sensitivity and 82.8% specificity.341

Several studies have also been carried out to profile changes in lncRNA expression after stroke.351, 352 These studies implicate lncRNAs associated with genes involved in lipoprotein production, ABO blood type, prostaglandin synthesis, hematopoietic cell lineage, and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.351, 352 Several lncRNAs have been shown to play significant roles in cerebral ischemia pathology. For example, MEG3 was increased following cerebral ischemia in mice where it was shown to bind p53 and promote post-ischemic neuronal death.353 MEG3 silencing reduced infarct size, improved neurological scoring, and promoted angiogenesis in rats and mice subjected to MCAO.354, 355 MEG3 has been implicated in apoptosis by targeting the miR-21/programmed cell death 4 pathway.355 ANRIL (CDKN2BAS) overexpression in diabetes mellitus rats upregulated VEGF, NF-κB, p-IκB/IκB and stimulated angiogenesis following MCAO.356 FosDT has been shown to increase following focal ischemia and associates with the chromatin modifying proteins sin3a and coREST to induce REST.357 Knockdown of FosDT and REST have been shown to decrease infarct size and improve functional recovery up to 7 days of reperfusion following focal ischemic injury.357, 358 Other lncRNAs implicated in ischemic stroke include H19, which provided BV2 cells neuroprotection following OGD when silenced68, N1LR, which prevented apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells when overexpressed359, and GAS5, which provided neuroprotection via decreased competition with miR-137 following MCAO in mice or OGD in cortical neurons when overexpressed.360

A key lncRNA identified in cerebral ischemia is MALAT1 (a.k.a NEAT2) which has been shown to be upregulated after OGD and MCAO.67, 361 Knockout of MALAT1 increased pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory factors and infarct size, and has been shown to directly associate with Bim and E-selectin following MCAO in mice.67 MALAT1 was shown to mediate autophagy and protect brain microvascular endothelial cells after OGD treatment.362 Conversely, MALAT1 inhibition downregulated autophagy, which induced neuroprotection following MCAO in mice363 indicating MALAT1 involvement in cerebral ischemia is complex and warrants additional research.

Hemorrhagic Stroke

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are two cerebrovascular events resulting in bleeding of the tissue around the brain and bleeding within the brain tissue, respectively. Hemorrhagic strokes account for only a small portion of strokes, but lead to high rates of disability364, 365, appear earlier in life than ischemic events365–367, and are responsible for over 25% of potential years of life lost to stroke.368, 369 Not only do hemorrhagic strokes often lead to secondary cerebrovascular events like vasospasms, ischemia, and hydrocephalus365, 370–373, but they also cause non-neurological complications like heart, lung, kidney, and liver injury or failure.365, 374 Risk factors for SAH and ICH include inflammation375, malformations and tumors376, anticoagulation medication377, and heavy alcohol consumption.378 Lack of screening technology and the reliance on surgical approaches for treatment are major contributors to the devastating effects of these brain bleeds.379–381 Epigenetics alterations represent potential mechanisms through which hemorrhagic stroke may not only be detected, but also treated (Table 5).

Research on the role of DNA methylation in hemorrhagic stroke is still in its infancy, but a few studies indicate this epigenetic modification may play a role in hemorrhagic stroke pathology. For example, ITPR3, a gene involved in vasospasms caused by SAH382, was significantly hypermethylated in patients that experience delayed cerebral ischemia following SAH.383 In addition, SAH patients with delayed cerebral ischemia had higher levels of DNMT1 as well as lower levels of ITPR3 mRNA and TET1.383 In an autologous blood injection model of mouse ICH, TET1, TET2, TET3 and 5hmC were downregulated from 24–72 hours following hemorrhage.384 AKT2, PDPK1, and VEGF genes displayed decreased hydroxymethylation and increased methylation, resulting in a downregulation of AKT2, PDPK1 and VEGF expression.384

Histone modifications relating to brain bleeds like SAH and ICH have not been thoroughly explored; however, as with each disorder and injury discussed in this review, HDACi may be a promising therapeutic strategy. SAHA administration after spontaneously induced ICH in mice was shown to not only reverse H3 hypoacetylation but also decrease apoptosis, hemin-induced cytotoxicity, behavior deficits, and microglial and astrocytic activation.385 Similar to the neuroprotective effects of SAHA, VPA administration in a rat model of ICH inhibited inflammation and caspase activity, upregulated BCL-2 and BCL-XL while downregulating BAX.386

Despite the lack of classical epigenetic marker studies in SAH and ICH, several studies have been performed assessing the role of noncoding RNAs. Extensive research into circulating biomarkers for hemorrhagic stroke has been conducted. A serum study evaluating miRNA levels has shown that miR-502–5p, miR-1297 and miR-4320 levels are higher in SAH patients when compared to control groups.387 Furthermore, miR-502–5p and miR-1297 were even significantly higher in those with severe SAH when compared to non-severe SAH.387 Another serum study identified 86 differently expressed miRNA, 69 upregulated and 17 downregulated, between three severities of intracranial aneurysms and the healthy control group.388 Important gene pathways found in this study included smooth muscle cell proliferation, apoptosis, myosin generation, and actin cytoskeleton organization.388 Plasma studies have identified miR-16 and miR-25 as dysregulated in intracranial aneurysm patients389 while inflammatory miRNAs are most pronounced in ICH patients.390 Studies in intracranial aneurysm tissue showed aberrations in several miRNA in common including miR-23b, miR-24–1, and isoforms of miR-143 and miR-145.391, 392 These studies both indicate gene networks involved in smooth muscle cell proliferation and movement may be involved.391, 392 Finally, potential biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid393–395 and animal models396, 397 have also been proposed.

After ICH, plasma and brain tissue levels of miR-124 were increased followed by a slow decrease with patient recovery.398 This is mirrored in an induced ICH rat model, with miR-124 levels returning to normal by day 60.398 In an erythrocyte lysate model of ICH, miR-124 was significantly downregulated in microglia.399 However, when microglia were transduced with miR-124, M1 markers decreased, M2 markers increased, and microglia-induced cytotoxicity of neurons decreased.399 In vivo, mimics of miR-124 also reduced water content of the mouse brain.399 This study further showed that miR-124 acts by way of BCL-2, BCL-XL, and C/EBP-α to produce these neuroprotective effects.399

In ICH and SAH, let-7a and let-7c also play important roles and have shown to have neuroprotective efficacy. In both thrombin-induced cytotoxicity models and induced ICH rat models, let-7c was significantly upregulated.400 Administration of a let-7c antagomir reduced numbers of MPO+ neutrophils and OX42+ microglia in the basal ganglia and cortex.400 In addition, let-7c antagomir treatment improved functional outcome and decreased cell death by restoring IGF1 and p-AKT.400 In the endovascular perforation SAH mouse model, melatonin improved neurological scores and reduced brain water content through the H19 lncRNA, which associates with let-7a and the let-7a target NGF.401

A number of other miRNAs that have shown therapeutic potential by modulating inflammatory responses have also been identified. Administration of miR-126–3p mimic reduced MPO+ neutrophils, OX42+ microglia, and apoptosis in ICH rats.402 Restoration of miR-126 in ICH rats showed neuroprotection, by VEGF upregulation and caspase-3 inhibition.403 MiR-144 upregulation in ICH mice was shown to downregulate the mTOR pathway.404 Inhibition of miR-144 with an antagomir reduced autophagy and inflammation as well as improved function in ICH mice.404 Augmentation of miR-132 in ICH mice reduced brain edema and restored integrity to the BBB.405 MiR-233 was shown to directly bind to and downregulate NLRP3 of the inflammasome after ICH in mice406, providing another mechanism through which inflammation can be prevented. Finally, restoration of miR-27a-3p levels after collagenase-induced ICH in rats improved functional recovery by inhibiting aquaporin-11, increasing BBB integrity, and decreasing edema.407

Dysregulation of lncRNA expression has been observed in several models of hemorrhagic stroke. A study in rats found 64 upregulated and 144 downregulated lncRNA in early brain injury after SAH.408 In mice, SAH led to upregulation of 103 lncRNAs and downregulation of 514 lncRNAs.409 A preliminary study on ICH in rats found 625 differentially expressed lncRNA corresponding to 826 mRNA.410 Within human studies, 2926 differentially expressed lncRNA were identified in intracranial aneurysm tissue and superficial temporal arteries.411 However, further research is needed to identify the specific roles of lncRNAs in hemorrhagic stroke pathogenesis.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects nearly 4 million Americans each year and accounts for a large percentage of injury-related deaths.412 Diffuse brain injuries, affecting the entire brain, and focal brain injuries, affecting a specific area of the brain, are most commonly caused in the field of battle or motor vehicle accidents.412–415 TBI presents with a host of neurological symptoms from contusions and hemorrhage to mood changes and memory loss.412, 413, 416 At the molecular level, homeostasis of excitatory neurotransmitter release is disrupted, axonal stretching and shearing occurs, and neurodegenerative pathology like amyloid plaques may appear.412, 417–421 Although the epigenetic study of TBI is in its infancy, results pointing towards therapeutic intervention are promising (Table 6).

In a weight drop model of TBI in adult rats, global cellular DNA hypomethylation was observed within 24 hours and up to 48 hour post-injury.422 Activated microglia/macrophages were identified as the major source of the reduced 5-mC in the peri-lesion area.422 Within repeated blast-injury model of TBI in rats, significant differential methylation between neurons and glia has been shown in the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway, which includes genes like MAP2K6, RUNX3, NODAL, and SMAD1 which regulates cell survival.423 Hypermethylation and decreased expression of the aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase AANAT gene that mediates serotonin-to-melatonin conversion was also observed.423 In blast-induced TBI in rats, there was a negative correlation between blast severity and global DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus, indicating that the degree of injury may influence methylation imbalance.424 In a rat blast model of TBI, hippocampal DNMT1, DNMT3b, TET2, TET3 and TDG expression increased while prefrontal cortical DNMT3b expression was decreased and TET2 expression was increased two weeks following injury.425 In addition, controlled cortical impact (CCI) induced TBI in rats upregulates insulin-like growth factor 1B (IGF-1B) hippocampal and cortical mRNA levels.426 Three days after injury, when IGF-1B mRNA levels are highest, the P1 promoter region and sites upstream/within exon 5 are hypermethylated while the P2 promotor region is unchanged and sites downstream of exon 5 are hypomethylated with respect to sham animals.426 IGF-1B has been implicated in neural plasticity and regeneration and is considered as a potential therapeutic target after TBI.427

Several epigenetic marks of histone acetylation that activate gene expression including H3k9ac and H3K4me3 at the P1 promoter region, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K36me3, and H3K4me3 at the P2 promoter region, and H3K9ac, H3K36me3, and H3K4me3 at exon 5 of IGF-1B are also increased after CCI injury in rats three days after injury.426 In the hippocampal CA3 region, both acetylation and methylation were decreased 6–72 hours after CCI injury in another rat study.428 Following closed head injury TBI in mice, administration of the HDAC inhibitor ITF2357 was shown to be neuroprotective by preventing H3 deacetylation.429 Several other HDAC inhibitors were also tested after TBI. VPA decreases lesion volume and improves motor function in rats subjected to CCI TBI.430, 431 Combined administration of sub-effective VPA and lithium doses had the same influence on mice subject to CCI injury.432 Fluoxetine induces neurogenesis in CCI injury mice; however, no improvement in gait or spatial learning and memory is seen.433 Furthermore, sodium butyrate administration to mice subject to CCI injury increases histone acetylation, but does not significantly improve function unless combined with behavioral training.434

Several studies have shown that dysregulation of hundreds of miRNAs occurs in the rodent hippocampus and cortex following TBI as early as 1 hour, and up to 7 days post injury.435–440 Distinctive miRNA expression profiles have been observed in a temporal manner following TBI, indicating the association of various miRNAs with differing stages of TBI progression. Altered miRNAs have been associated with processes that regulate transcriptional regulation, oxidative stress, metabolism, synaptic signaling and signal transduction, inflammation, neurogenesis, angiogenesis and apoptosis.435, 437, 439 Interestingly, a mouse study using a weight drop model of TBI, showed that differential expression of miRNAs may also be observed depending on the severity of TBI.441

A study performed in the rat hippocampus found 10 miRNAs that were consistently altered from 1 hour to 7 days following moderate TBI. Of these, miR-144, miR-153 and miR-340–5p were elevated and their predicted targets calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and alpha-synuclein were downregulated, respectively.437 Although the roles of miR-144, miR-152 and miR-340–5p in TBI have not been evaluated, their targets have been shown to play important roles in neuroprotection and are implicated in learning and memory following TBI in rats.437, 442 Other miRNAs with important roles in TBI include miR-23a and miR-27a which have been shown to reduce apoptosis and modulate autophagy in a neuroprotective manner following overexpression or mimetic treatment in rodent models of TBI.443–445 MiR-124–3p was shown to increase in microglia and microglial exosomes from mouse brain extracts after treatment with repetitive CCI injury.446 Administration of exosomes derived from microglia overexpressing miR-124–3p improved mice neurological recovery following repetitive CCI by downregulating mTOR and reducing inflammation.446 Let-7c-5p overexpression was also shown to reduce inflammatory processes by attenuating microglial activation, which led to reduced brain edema improved neurological scores in mice subjected to CCI.447 Interestingly, miR-155 has been shown to be both neuroprotective448, 449 and damaging to the brain.450 The differences in experimental design may have led to these results as the first study tested miR-155 knockout mice with CCI448, the second used the formononetin drug to modulate miR-155 in rats using weight drop injury449 and the third tested RNA silencing of miR-155 in mice with CCI.450

Other studies have shown that miR-21 expression is consistently upregulated from 6h to 72h in the cortex and from 24h to 72h in the hippocampus following CCI in rodents436, 440, 451, indicating miR-21 may play a pivotal role in pathology of TBI progression. In a study evaluating age differences, miR-21 was upregulated in adult mice subject to brain injury; however, miR-21 was not altered following injury in elderly mice.452 Despite increased expression of miR-21 upon TBI, miR-21 mimetic administration has been shown to be neuroprotective against scratch-cell injury in cortical neurons453 as well as rats subjected to fluid percussion.454 Co-culture of scratch-injured neurons with miR-21–5p-overexpressing neurons or administration of miR-21–5p overexpressing exosomes was also neuroprotective.455 Finally, MiR-21 mimic administration in rats with or without hydrogen gas treatment improved functional outcome following CCI or fluid percussion injury, respectively.456, 457 In addition to hippocampal tissue, miR-21 expression increased in extracellular vesicles after TBI, suggesting its promise in future biomarker screens.458

There have been several attempts to establish miRNA profiles to serve biomarker development. Differential expression has been surveyed in serum459–462, plasma463–467, CSF462, 468–470, saliva468, and extracellular vesicles471 of humans and animals. Several therapeutic interventions such as exercise hypothermia have been shown to alter the miRNA profiles and improve cognitive function and recovery following TBI in rodents.472–474 The let-7 family has been involved in multiple studies467, 469 and may prove to be a promising pathway in TBI.

Emerging evidence indicates lncRNAs may be implicated in TBI. Microarray studies have revealed significant alterations in lncRNA expression in the brain following rodent models of TBI.475–477 Administration of MALAT1 deficient exosomes derived from adipose stem cells caused rats to develop larger lesions following CCI.478 Bioinformatics analysis revealed that MALAT1 might modulate pathways related to inflammation and cell regeneration, indicating potential therapeutic effects of MALAT1 in TBI.478 In mice subjected to CCI, NEAT1 overexpression inhibited apoptosis and inflammation, while knockdown of NEAT1 downregulated hundreds of genes, many of which are involved in synaptic and axonal health.479

Epilepsy

Epilepsy, a group of neurological disorders characterized by recurrent seizures, affects 50 million people globally.480, 481 Epilepsy encompasses both focal and generalized seizures; however, most common is temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) which often presents with hippocampal sclerosis.481–484 Epilepsy can be brought about by trauma, an infection, or improper neurodevelopment leading to neuronal hyperexcitability that can lie latent for years.481, 485 The disorders are commonly marked by anxiety, cognitive defects, and decreased social interaction.481, 486, 487 Although antiepileptic drugs are given to reverse excitability, they do not target the root cause of the disorder and over 30% of patients become drug resistant.483, 485, 488, 489 In addition, surgical intervention has a nearly 50% failure rate.483, 490 Target genes in epileptogenesis that lead to several pathways of dysfunction have been established, including synaptic plasticity, ion transport, and inflammation, suggesting epigenetic therapies may be possible (Table 7).483, 491–497

There have been several attempts to characterize DNA methylation within epilepsy. Global hypermethylation has been observed in epileptic human and mouse hippocampal specimens affecting pathways such as neuron remodeling and maturation.498, 499 Levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3a were increased in human TLE neocortices specifically in NeuN-positive neurons, but not GFAP-positive astrocytes.500 Comparisons of brain tissue between drug-refractory epileptic patients and control patients showed differential methylation of 224 genes.501 A ketogenic, high fat, low carbohydrate diet was shown to reverse global hypermethylation and ameliorate seizure progression in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats499, indicating that aberrant methylation promotes pathology. Interestingly, induction of epilepsy in rats through focal amygdala stimulation, systemic pilocarpine injection, or lateral fluid-percussion induced traumatic brain injury did not result in a similar spatiality or degree of methylation despite global hypermethylation across all three models.502 This suggests that although global hypermethylation is a general feature of epilepsy, distinct DNA methylation patterns exist depending on etiology.502

In humans with focal epilepsy and febrile seizures, the promoter of carboxypeptidase 6 (CPA6), a gene involved in familial and sporadic cases of epilepsy, is highly methylated compared to controls.503 Patients with TLE were shown to have increased reelin promoter methylation, a gene important to hippocampal development.504 Subjects with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy have varied methylation of cation-chloride transporters, with lower sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1 methylation and higher potassium-chloride transporter member 5 methylation in the epilepsy group.505 Increased methylation of ionotropic glutamate receptor 2 (GRIA2) has been observed in hippocampal slices of mice and rats subjected to kainic acid-induced epilepsy, which was reversed with administration of the DNMT inhibitor RG108.506 TLE patients and pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats display decreased levels of Ras-guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RASgrf1) in the neocortex and hippocampus, respectively.507 In mice subject to acute epileptic seizures using kainic acid, the RASgrf1 promoter was methylated, suppressing levels of RASgrf mRNA; however, treatment with the DNMT inhibitor RG108 reversed this trend as well as reduced seizures.508 During memory consolidation in kainic acid-induced TLE rats, methylation of BDNF was significantly decreased leading to an upregulation of BDNF mRNA and increased memory deficit; however, following administration of methionine, BDNF methylation was increased, BDNF mRNA was decreased, and memory deficits were reversed.509

The methylation pattern of noncoding gene promoters has also been studied. In human hippocampus specimens, 12 differentially methylated miRNA were discovered, with half hypomethylated and upregulated and half hypermethylated and downregulated.498 This same study found hypermethylation of several lncRNAs including UCA1, ADARB2-AS1, LINC324, and MAP3K14-AS1.498 In a study characterizing epileptic whole blood samples, 87% and 85% of differentially methylated lncRNA and miRNA promoters were hypermethylated, respectively.510 Differentially methylated lncRNA were related mRNAs involved in ion/gated channel activity, GABA receptor activity, and synaptic transmission while differentially methylated miRNA were related to neuronal projection and differentiation, protein kinase activity, and axonal guidance.510

Several studies have attempted to characterize the landscape of histone modifications within epilepsy. Expression of HDAC5 and HDAC9 was shown to increase significantly in mice subject to kainic acid, while expression of HDAC5 and HDAC9 decreased in pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice.511 In addition, both epileptic groups of mice showed a sharp decrease in HDAC7 expression during the acute seizure period.511 Kainic acid-induced epileptic mice displayed decreased HDAC1, 2, and 11 expression in the acute phase (2–6h after kainic acid treatment) followed by a subsequent increase of all class I HDACs from 12–48 hours.512 Pilocarpine-treated mice model showed similar acute results, but HDAC2, 3, and 8 were decreased during the chronic phase (14 and 28 days following pilocarpine treatment).512 In rats, pilocarpine exposures led to decreased hippocampal acetylation of H4 at the GRIA2 promoter, downregulating GRIA2 mRNA expression.513 However, administration of the HDACi TSA reversed deacetylation and prevented GRIA2 mRNA downregulation.513 Interestingly, this study also found that H4 acetylation increased at the BDNF promoter P2.513 The findings of this study complement the previously discussed methylation studies and point to both DNA methylation and histone acetylation playing a role in GRIA2 and BDNF levels in epilepsy.

Rodent studies have shown promise for HDACi treatment in epilepsy. Administration of SB or VPA in WAG/Rij rats (a model for absent epilepsy that displays H3 and H4 hypoacetylation) increased brain histone acetylation, decreased HDAC1 and HDAC3 expression, and reduced seizures.514 Furthermore, the protective effects were intensified by co-administration of SB and VPA.514 SB was also used in a mouse kindling model of TLE which showed decreased HDAC expression, reduced seizures, and decreased mossy fiber sprouting.515

The field of noncoding RNA within the pathogenesis, prediction, and prevention of epilepsy has been extensively explored. MiR-134 has been found to be an important factor in dendritic spine density and morphology in pilocarpine- or kainic acid-induced mouse models of epilepsy.516, 517 MiR-134 inhibition reduced seizures in multiple rodent models of epilepsy.516–518 In the pilocarpine mouse model of status epilepticus, dendritic spine volume increased upon administration of a cholesterol-tagged locked nucleotide acid (LNA) miR-134 antagomir in CA3 pyramidal neurons.516 Pre-treatment with the LNA antagomir and subsequent induction of status epilepticus resulted in increased survival and decreased seizures.516 Another study showed that miR-134 LNA antagomir reduced dendritic spine density in CA3 pyramidal neurons, but still prevented seizures in kainic acid-treated mice.517 In the mouse pentylenetetrazol-induced model of epilepsy, LNA miR-134 antagomir treatment reduced the number of spontaneous seizures and convulsive behavior.518 Similarly, rats subjected to the perforant pathway stimulation model showed reduced spontaneous seizures with LNA miR-134 antagomir treatment.518

Status epilepticus induced by kainic acid in mice was shown to increase levels of miR-132 as well as its binding to Argonaute-2.519 Subsequent inhibition of miR-123 with an LNA antagomir reduced hippocampal neuronal death.519 MiR-124 was significantly reduced after kainic acid induction in rats and subsequent supplementation with synthetic miR-124 inhibited NSRF, effectively contributing to neuroprotection against epilepsy.520 However, miR-124 supplementation also promoted inflammation, by enhancing microglia activation, effectively contributing to the epileptic state.520 Another study showed that intrahippocampal administration of miR-124 reduced the severity and occurrence of seizures in both the pentylenetetrazole- and pilocarpine-induced rat models of epilepsy by repressing of CREB, a key protein in epileptogenesis.520, 521 Importantly, it has been shown that miR-124 was decreased in the hippocampus of adult patients with TLE520, while miR-124 was upregulated in the hippocampus of children with mesial TLE522, revealing dynamic differences of this miRNA with age and etiology.

Pilocarpine-induced temporal lobe epilepsy in mice resulted in the upregulation of 22 lncRNA and downregulation of 83 lncRNA in the hippocampus.523 Another mouse study identified the dysregulation of 384 lncRNA in the pilocarpine model and 279 in the kainic acid model when analyzing whole brain, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum tissue.524 The lncRNA UCA1 was shown to increase in tandem with NF-κB after pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in the brain of rats525 and UCA1 overexpression inhibited apoptosis and suppressed seizures.526 Finally, the lncRNA H19 is significantly upregulated in the latent period of pilocarpine-induced and kainic acid-induced epilepsy in rats where it was shown to regulate apoptosis through sponging of let-7b.527 Microarray analysis following knockdown or overexpression of H19 in kainic-acid induced epileptic rats revealed involvement of H19 in a number of epileptogenic processes including demyelination, immune response, and inflammation.528 Inhibition of H19 was shown to protect against hippocampal neuronal death in kainic acid-treated rats527, indicating a potential role for H19 as a therapeutic target in epilepsy.

Several studies have been conducted to identify miRNA biomarkers of epilepsy in serum, of which the most accurate predict the disorder with 81.2% sensitivity.529, 530 Other studies have observed expression profiles that distinctly identify epilepsy in human cerebrospinal fluid531, rat hippocampus and peripheral blood532, rat hippocampal granule cells and plasma533, and rat synaptosomes.534, 535 Profiling studies have also characterized miRNA from the hippocampus of epilepsy patients with TLE, showed overall failure of mature miRNA processing due to Dicer loss in TLE and identified dysregulation of a number of miRNAs involved in immune response.536, 537 Mooney et al. has provided a comprehensive database known as EpimiRBase providing a plethora of miRNA-epilepsy associations in both human and animal studies538 facilitating future work in identifying key miRNAs involved pathophysiology or as biomarkers.

CONCLUSION &amp; FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Advancements in epigenetics have revolutionized our understanding into the mechanisms involved in brain diseases. The evidence thus far from various disease models from cell lines to the post-mortem human brain reveals a critical role for epigenetic dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and acute brain injury. These studies demonstrate that epigenetic imbalances in DNA methylation and histone modifications by molecular readers, writers and erasers predispose the brain to disease as well as influence neurological recovery. While the role of epigenetics in diseases of the brain is still emerging, it is clear that restoration of epigenetic imbalances may provide potential treatments that lead to recovery. HDAC inhibitors have emerged as an overlapping therapy among all of the brain diseases discussed. However, despite the protective effects shown in animal studies, some studies have shown certain downsides to HDAC inhibitor therapy including inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis.539–541 Therefore, additional research is needed to further delineate the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors function in various CNS disorders. Profiling of blood biomarkers is another promising clinical epigenetic approach that may help diagnosis and therapeutic development for CNS disorders. Biomarker profiling of DNA methylation and miRNA has already been used to develop prognostic and diagnostic indicators in brain disorders, and epigenetic profiles in neurological diseases continue to be developed. More recently, lncRNA profiling has emerged as an additional potential biomarker tool. Modulation of various epigenetic regulatory mechanisms has been shown to provide therapeutic potential against several pathophysiological mechanisms. However, the current challenge lies in further elucidating the interplay between epigenetic changes and the downstream effects on gene expression and the complex cellular environment of the diseased brain.

Fig. 1: DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation.

DNA methylation occurs through the addition of a methyl (CH3) group to the cytosine of DNA by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to produce 5-methylcytosine (5-mC). DNA methylation leads to densely packed heterochromatin that is consistent with gene inactivation. 5-mC can subsequently be converted to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases. Hydroxymethylation loosens chromatin to promote gene activation.

Fig. 2: Histone methylation.

Histone methylation is the addition of methyl (CH3) groups to arginine and lysine side chains by histone methyltransferases (HMTs). The effect of histone methylation on gene transcription is dependent on the location and degree of methylation. For example, methylation of histone 3, lysine residue 4 (H3K4) is an activating mark whereas H3K9 is a deactivating mark.

Fig.3: Histone acetylation.

Histone acetylation occurs with the addition of acetyl (CH3CO) groups to lysine side chains by histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Acetylation reduces the steric clash between histones and DNA, opening up chromatin for gene transcription. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) reverse this modification and repress gene transcription.
