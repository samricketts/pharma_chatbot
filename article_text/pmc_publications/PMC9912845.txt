Atherosclerosis (ATH) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are both age-dependent inflammatory diseases, associated with infiltrated macrophages and vascular pathology and overlapping molecules. C/EBPβ, an Aβ or inflammatory cytokine-activated transcription factor, and AEP (asparagine endopeptidase) are intimately implicated in both ATH and AD; however, whether C/EBPβ/AEP signaling couples ATH to AD pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here we show that C/EBPβ/AEP pathway mediates ATH pathology and couples ATH to AD. Deletion of C/EBPβ or AEP from primary macrophages diminishes cholesterol load, and inactivation of this pathway reduces foam cell formation and lesions in aorta in ApoE−/− mice, fed with HFD (high-fat-diet). Knockout of ApoE from 3xTg AD mouse model augments serum LDL and increases lesion areas in the aorta. Depletion of C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice substantially attenuates these effects and elevates cerebral blood flow and vessel length, improving cognitive functions. Strikingly, knockdown of ApoE from the hippocampus of 3xTg mice decreases the cerebral blood flow and vessel length and aggravates AD pathologies, leading to cognitive deficits. Inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway alleviates these events and restores cognitive functions. Hence, our findings demonstrate that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling couples ATH to AD via mediating vascular pathology.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Atherosclerosis (ATH) is a progressive inflammatory disease characterized by buildup of lipids in the arterial vessel wall. As the disease progresses, atherosclerotic plaques accumulate and gradually narrow the arterial lumen. Atherosclerotic plaques remain stable for years, but can rapidly become unstable, rupture and trigger thrombus formation. Consequently, atherosclerotic plaques increase risk of acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, in addition to restriction of the vessel lumen [1]. ATH is featured with a complex process of vascular injury; inflammation, with monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs); lipid deposition within macrophage foam cells; neointimal hyperplasia, involving vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs); and extracellular matrix remodeling [2, 3]. In humans, atherosclerotic plaques can usually be found in the aorta, coronary arteries and in the carotid and cerebral arteries [4].

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease with gradual cognitive decline as one of the key clinical symptoms. The pathological features include extracellular senile plaques, mainly composed of aggregated amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits, and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), consisted of hyperphosphorylated and truncated Tau, associated with chronic neuron-inflammation and continuing neuronal loss in the brain [5]. Aging is the major risk factor for this devastating disease, and aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to the pathologies of ATH as well. Both diseases result from an inflammatory stress and they are tightly linked to sterol metabolism and innate immunity, leading to vascular occlusion [6]. Human ATH lesions contain Aβ [7]. Expression of human APP mutant in a strain of ATH-prone mice facilitates aortic ATH [8]. Shared involvement of the vasculature and APP/Aβ in both ATH and AD, together with common risk loci identified by GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies), accentuate the molecular overlaps between the two chronic disorders. GWAS studies demonstrate that ε4 allele at the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) locus is a major risk factor for both diseases. Disease progression in AD and ATH are accelerated in ApoE4 individuals, whereas E2 and E3 are protective. Interestingly, atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE knockout mice are significantly increased by overexpression of human APP mutant [9]. Conversely, knockout of APP reduces ATH plaque size by up to 90% in ApoE−/− animals [10], underscoring that APP plays a prominent role in ATH.

ApoE is a glycoprotein synthesized mainly in the liver and the brain and functions as a ligand for receptors that clear chylomicrons and VLDL remnants [11]. ApoE protein is a lipid transport that circulates in the blood in a complex with lipid-rich lipoprotein particles that carry largely insoluble cholesterol [12]. ApoE−/− mice, particularly when fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), develop atherosclerotic lesions similar to those in human ATH [13]. Mice deficient in the ApoE-binding LDL receptor (Ldlr−/−) develop ATH [14]. Deficiency of ApoE in mice leads to increased plasma levels of total cholesterol, mostly in the VLDL and chylomicron fractions [15], which are quadrupled by a high-fat or Western-type diet [16]. Both ApoE−/− and LDLr−/− mouse models are broadly used to study the mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of ATH. On a high-cholesterol diet, ApoE−/− mice develop ATH plaques more rapidly and with a more advanced phenotype as compared to LDLr−/− mice [17].

Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, also called legumain, gene name LGMN), an acidosis-activated cysteine protease, mainly resides in the endo-lysosomes [18]. We report that it acts as delta-secretase (δ-secretase) that cleaves both APP and Tau at N585 and N368 residues, respectively, accelerating Aβ production and Tau aggregation. Deletion of AEP from AD mouse models diminishes Aβ and NFT pathologies, restoring cognitive functions [19, 20]. Remarkably, AEP is age-dependently escalated and activated in human brains, cleaving both APP and Tau and facilitating AD pathogenesis [21]. Inhibition of AEP with a small molecular inhibitor blocks AD pathologies, ameliorating cognitive dysfunction in AD mouse models [22]. Notably, AEP is increased in both carotid plaques and plasma of patients with carotid ATH [23–25]. Chronic infusion of AEP into ApoE−/− mice potentiates the atherosclerotic lesions, accompanied by vascular remodeling, an increase in the number of macrophages and ASMCs in plaques. Notably, AEP is expressed at high levels in atheromatous plaques in ApoE−/− mice [26].

C/EBPβ is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein family of transcription factors with classical functions in transcriptional and translational regulation of lipid metabolism in the liver and adipose tissue [27, 28]. We found that C/EBPβ predominantly regulates LGMN mRNA transcription during aging. Knockout of C/EBPβ from 3xTg mice decreases AEP levels and abrogates AD pathologies, restoring cognitive functions [29]. Moreover, C/EBPβ/AEP signaling spatial-temporally mediates AD pathogenesis [30]. Interestingly, C/EBPβ acts as a macrophage lineage determination factor [31]. Hematopoietic deletion of C/EBPβ in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice [32] reduces inflammation and hyperlipidemia, and thereby interrupts the processes important for development of ATH [33]. C/EBPβ plays an important role in inflammation [34]. Most recently, we show that ApoE4 and 27-OHC (27-hydroxycholesterol) additively activate C/EBPβ/AEP pathway, driving AD pathogenesis [35]. Since ApoE4 and cholesterol are the crucial effectors for both diseases, we hypothesize that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling may couple ATH to AD pathology. In the current study, we investigate the biological roles of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in ATH and AD pathogenesis using 3xTg and APOE−/− animal models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

ApoE−/− mice and 3xTg mice on a C57BL/6J background were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. C/EBPβ knockout mice have been described and were maintained as heterozygotes on two separate strain backgrounds (C57BL/6 and 129Sv) [29]. AEP knockout mice on a mixed 129/Ola and C57BL/6 background were generated as reported [36]. All mice were bred in a pathogen-free environment in accordance with Emory Medical School guidelines. The 3 months old ApoE−/− mice and 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice were fed with high-fat diet (Research Diets, D12079B) for 12 weeks. The 3 months old 3xTg mice received bilateral injections of virus, and then were fed with high-fat diet for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed after behavior test. Animal care and handling was performed according to the NIH animal care guidelines and Emory Medical School guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Emory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Both male and female mice were used. Sample size was determined based on the result from Power and Precision software (Biostat). Animals were equally assigned to different groups for each sex according to a random number table, and there are 8 mice in each groups. Investigators were blinded to the group information during the animal experiments.

Stereotaxic injection in mouse hippocampus

Animals received bilateral injections of virus. After anesthetization, the mice had their heads shaved and restrained in a stereotaxic frame with mouse adapter (Stoeltling, Wood Dale, IL). Their heads cleaned with 70% ethanol. A small incision was made in the skin down the midline of the cranium, exposing the skull landmarks lambda and Bregma. Target injection coordinates were mapped from Bregma, and a small hole drilled through the skull directly above target sites with a bone drill. (3 μl of Adeno-associated viruses: AAV-Control or AAV-shApoE, GeneCopoeia.) Injection rate was 0.2 μl per minute, and the needle was left in place for 10 min post-injection. After injections, the incision was sutured and Neosporin applied. All surgeries were performed with IACUC approval.

Primary cultured macrophage cells

Murine peritoneal macrophages were isolated from 6 weeks old mice [37]. Briefly, 1 ml of the 3% Brewer thioglycollate medium (Fisher scientific, 211716) were injected into the peritoneal cavity. Four days later, these mice were euthanized. Retract the abdominal skin to expose the intact peritoneal wall, then insert needle through peritoneal wall along the mouse’s left side and inject 10 ml of harvest medium into each mouse. Fluid was aspirated from peritoneum and centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The cells were resuspended, about 2 × 106 cells were plated onto each well of 6-well plates for experiment. The macrophage cells were then put into a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The macrophages were treated with or without ox-LDL (20 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher, L34357) for 24 h in serum-free DMEM medium. Conditioned medium was collected for proinflammation cytokines assay. Cells were fixed and stained with Oil Red O to detect lipid accumulation.

Proinflammatory cytokines ELISA

Conditioned medium collected from macrophage were analyzed by IL-6 (Abcam, ab100712), TNFα (Thermo Fisher, 88–7324-88), IL-1β ELISA kit (Thermo Fisher, 88–7013-88) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proinflammatory cytokines concentrations were determined by comparison with the standard curve.

Local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) measurement

Under anesthesia, a skin incision was made on the mouse head to expose the whole skull. Laser scanning imaging measurements and analyses were performed using the PeriScans system and LDPIwin on the intact skull. The scanning region had a center point of stereotaxic injection point. In laser scanning imaging, the “single mode” with medium resolution was used to scan the photo image of LCBF.

Atherosclerosis studies

After 12 weeks of HFD treatment, mice were sacrificed. Aortas were collected from the base of ascending aorta to the iliac bifurcation after saline perfusion and 4% PFA perfusion via left ventricle. The hearts from mice were immersed in 30% sucrose overnight, and embedded in OCT compound followed by cryosections at a thickness of 10 μm after visualizing three aortic valves. The entire aorta luminal surface and cross-sections were stained with 0.3% Oil Red O (Sigma-Aldrich, 00625) solution for 5 min at room temperature, and then distained with 60% isopropanol for 10 s and hydrated with PBS.

Fluorescent micro-angiography

Mice were injected intracardially with 250 μl FITC-Albumin solutions (Sigma-Aldrich, A9771) (25 mg/ml in PBS) (25 mg/ml in PBS). Brains were removed after 1 min and fixed in 4% formalin for 48 h before processing. Brain slices were cut at 30 μm and stored at −20 °C in cryo-protective medium (Lonza, 12–132A). Images were acquired through Confocal (Olympus FV 1000).

Measurement of blood lipids profile

Blood samples were collected when mice were euthanized. Serum was separated by centrifugation and serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were measured by Cholesterol assay kit (Abcam, ab65390) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Aβ ELISA

The mice brains were homogenized in 8x mass of 5 M guanidine HCl/50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Then the samples were diluted with cold reaction buffer (phosphate buffered saline with 5% BSA and 0.03% Tween 20, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail). The supernatant was analyzed by human Aβ40 (Invitrogen, KHB3481) and Aβ42 ELISA kit (Invitrogen, KHB3441) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Aβ concentrations were determined by comparison with the standard curve.

ApoE ELISA

Blood samples were collected when mice were euthanized. Mice serum samples were separated by centrifugation and serum ApoE levels were measured by Apolipoprotein E Elisa kit (Abcam, ab215086) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

AEP activity assay

Tissue homogenates (10 μg) were incubated in 200 μl assay buffer (20 mM citric acid, 60 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS and 1 mM DTT, pH 6.0) containing 20 μM AEP substrate (Bachem, I-1865). AMC released by substrate cleavage was quantified by measuring at 460 nm in a fluorescence plate reader at 37 °C for 2 h in kinetic mode for 3 min.

Western blot analysis

The mouse brain tissue samples were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate and 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.0, supplemented with a cocktail of protease inhibitors), and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was boiled in SDS loading buffer. After SDS-PAGE, the samples were transfected to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed with a variety of antibodies.

Immunostaining

Free-floating 30 μm-thick brain sections or aortic valves sections were blocked in 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min, followed by incubation with primary antibodies for overnight at 4 °C. After being washed with TBS, the sections were incubated with a mixture of Alexa Fluor 488-, 568-, or Cy5-coupled secondary antibodies for detection. Images were acquired through Confocal (Olympus FV 1000).

Golgi staining

Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, and then immersed in 3% potassium bichromate foe 3 days in the dark. The solution was changed each day. Then the brains were transformed into 2% silver nitrate solution and incubated for 24 h in the dark. Vibratome sections were cut at 60 μm, air dried for 10 min, and then coverslipped.

Morris water maze

3xTg mice were trained in a round, water-filled tub (52 inches diameter) in an environment rich with extra maze cues. Each subject was given 3 trails/day for 5 consecutive days with a 15-min inter-trial interval. The maximum trial length was 60 s, and if subjects did not reach the platform in the allotted time, they were manually guided to do it. Following the 5 days task acquisition, a probe trial was presented, during which time the platform was removed. All trials were analyzed for latency and swim speed by means of MazeScan (Clever Sys, Inc.).

Contextual and cued fear conditioning

The ability to form and retain an association between an aversive experience and environmental cues was tested with a standard fear conditioning paradigm that occurs over a period of 3 days. Mice were placed in the fear conditioning apparatus (7” W, 7” D 3 12′’H, Coulbourn) composed of Plexiglass with a metal shock grid floor and allowed to explore the enclosure for 3 min. Following this habituation period, three conditioned stimulus (CS)-unconditioned stimulus (US) pairings were presented with a 1 min inter-trial interval. The CS was composed of a 20 s, 85-dB tone and US was composed of 2 s of a 0.5-mA footshock, which was co-terminate with each CS 708 presentation. One minute following the last CS-US presentation, mice were returned to their 32 home cages. On day 2, the mice were presented with a context test, during which subjects were placed in the same chamber used during conditioning on day 1 and the amount of freezing was recorded via a camera and the software provided by Coulbourn. No shocks were given during the context test. On day 3, a tone test was presented, during which time subjects were exposed to the CS in a novel compartment. Initially, animals were allowed to explore the novel context for 2 min. Then the 85-db tone was presented for 6 min and the amount of freezing behavior was recorded.

Statistical analysis

All data are expressed as Mean ± SEM from three or more independent experiments and analyzed using GraphPad Prism statistical. The level of significance between two groups was assessed with Student’s t test. For more than two groups, one-way ANOVA test was applied. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS

Deletion of C/EBPβ or AEP ameliorates atherosclerosis pathologies in ApoE−/− mice

Macrophages play a central role in atherogenesis through the accumulation of cholesterol and the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines. A critical step in the development of ATH is the accumulation of cholesterol-laden macrophages, which in the arterial wall is the characteristic of the early atherosclerotic lesion [38, 39]. To explore C/EBPβ and AEP’s roles in cholesterol uptake, we prepared primary macrophages from wild-type littermates, C/EBPβ+/− and AEP−/− mice and incubated these cells with vehicle or cholesterol carrying oxidative LDL (Ox-LDL). Oil Red O staining showed that deletion of C/EBPβ or AEP significantly decreased lipid accumulation in macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 1A). ELISA analysis revealed that the secreted inflammatory cytokines were reduced when C/EBPβ or AEP was depleted. Ox-LDL strongly elevated inflammatory cytokines release in the media and knockout of C/EBPβ or AEP greatly diminished IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα secretion at baseline not in response to ox-LDL (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Hence, inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in macrophages decreases cholesterol load and inflammatory cytokines.

To explore C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in vivo role in ATH formation, we crossed C/EBPβ+/− and AEP−/− mice with ApoE−/− mice, respectively. Since C/EBPβ−/− mice exhibited complicated phenotypes and are hard to breed [40], hence, we chose C/EBPβ+/− mice instead to avoid unnecessary interferences. The crossed ApoE−/−/C/EBPβ+/− mice and ApoE−/−/AEP−/− mice were fed with HFD for 12 weeks. Both ApoE−/−/C/EBPβ+/− mice and ApoE−/−/AEP−/− mice displayed lighter body weights than ApoE−/− mice at the end of the treatment (Fig. 1A). Noticeably, both serum cholesterol and LDL concentrations in the two strains of mice with inactive C/EBPβ/AEP signaling were evidently decreased versus ApoE−/− mice; in contrast, HDL levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1B–D), indicating that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling is critical for LDL cholesterol production in macrophages. Oil Red O staining of the whole aorta demonstrated that inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway pronouncedly diminished lesion areas in ApoE−/−/C/EBPβ+/− mice and ApoE−/−/AEP−/− mice as compared to ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 1E, F). Moreover, Oil Red O staining of the aortic sinus cryosection from mice showed that the lesion areas in ApoE−/−/C/EBPβ+/− mice and ApoE−/−/AEP−/− mice were significantly reduced versus ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 1G, H). Immunofluorescent (IF) co-staining revealed that CD68+ macrophages and lesion areas were declined in the aorta of ApoE−/−/C/EBPβ+/− mice and ApoE−/−/AEP−/− mice compared to ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 1I–K). Thus, crippling C/EBPβ/AEP pathway diminishes cholesterol-laden macrophages and ATH in ApoE−/− mice.

Depletion of C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice attenuates atherosclerosis

The hypoperfusion and hypoxia caused by ATH of cerebral vessels may enhance the production of Aβ, which, in turn, may promote formation of atherosclerotic lesions through vascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction leading to additional vascular damage [41]. Accordingly, we crossed ApoE−/− mice with 3xTg mice to interrogate the impact of ATH on AD pathologies and vice versus. 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice exhibited heavier body weight than ApoE−/− littermates. After 2 months of HFD treatment, the body weight difference was further enlarged, though the relative body weight gain ratios remained comparable (Supplementary Fig. 3A). As expected, both serum cholesterol and LDL concentrations in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice were significantly higher than ApoE−/− mice. Again, serum HDL levels were similar between these two strains of mice (Supplementary Fig. 3B–D). Oil Red staining of aorta and quantitative analysis demonstrated that 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice revealed larger lesion areas than ApoE−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3E, F). Oil Red O staining of the aortic sinus cryosection revealed that 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice displayed more lesion areas than ApoE−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3G, H). In accordance with these findings, more CD68+ macrophages were accumulated in the arterial wall of 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice than ApoE−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3I, J). Therefore, ATH is exacerbated in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice as compared to ApoE−/− mice, fitting with previous finding that atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE−/− mice are substantially increased by overexpression of human APP mutant [9].

To investigate the role of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in this event, we bred C/EBPβ+/− or AEP−/− mice with 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, followed by HFD treatment. Remarkably, 3xTg/ApoE−/−/C/EBPβ+/− mice and 3xTg/ApoE−/−/AEP−/− mice body weights were substantively lighter than 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 2A). Consistently, both serum cholesterol and LDL levels were significantly dwindled in two strains of mice as compared to 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, whereas serum HDL concentrations remained comparable among these animals (Fig. 2B–D). Oil Red staining of aorta and the aortic sinus cryosection demonstrated that the lesion areas were reduced when C/EBPβ or AEP−/− was depleted from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 2E–H). In alignment with these findings, arterial accumulated CD68+ macrophages were greatly diminished when C/EBPβ or AEP was knocked out from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 2I–K). Hence, inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling attenuates ATH in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice.

Deletion of C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice increases the cerebral blood flow and blood vessel length

Knockout of ApoE from 3xTg AD mouse model increases ATH pathologies (Supplementary Fig. 3). To assess whether this effect influences the cerebral blood flow, we monitored the laser Doppler flowmetry heatmaps that indicate the LCBF. Interestingly, ApoE −/− mice displayed lower CBF than 3xTg mice, suggesting that arterial lipid accumulation in ApoE−/− mice decreases the blood flow as compared to 3xTg AD mouse model. Strikingly, the lowest CBF was observed in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, and deletion of either C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice strongly escalated CBF (Fig. 3A, B). Next, we examined microvascular morphology by performing IF co-staining with FITC-Albumin (green) and Aβ (red) in the cortex. Quantification of microvascular morphology revealed that blood vessel length tightly correlated with CBF activities (Fig. 3C, D). By contrast, vascular Aβ deposits inversely coupled to the CBF activities (Fig. 3E). To examine whether the aberrant CBF triggers oxidative stress in the brain, we conducted 4HNE (red) staining in the cortex and found that 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice displayed the strongest oxidative stress among ApoE KO and 3xTg mice, and knockout of C/EBPβ or AEP significantly subsided oxidative stresses in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 3F, G). Consistent with the elevated oxidative stress, IF co-staining with anti-Iba1 (red) and anti-C/EBPβ (green) or anti-AEP (green) in the cortex revealed that active microglia cells (Iba1+, Red) were the most abundant in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, which were subdued when C/EBPβ or AEP was deleted (Fig. 3H–J), indicating that the oxidative stress tightly associates with neuroinflammation in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, and knockout of C/EBPβ or AEP ameliorates both in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice. Thus, these observations strongly suggest that ATH-induced brain hypoperfusion contributes to the pathological manifestations of AD.

Inactivation of C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice ameliorates AD pathologies and restores cognitive deficits

Cerebral ATH is a strong contributory factor to sporadic AD pathogenesis [42]. To dissect the pathological role of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in mediating ATH and AD pathogenesis, we performed immunoblotting (IB) analysis with the brain tissues from the above mice. The total levels of C/EBPβ were markedly elevated in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice as compared to ApoE−/− or 3xTg mice, and p-C/EBPβ, a biomarker for its activation, oscillated with total protein levels. Truncated (active) AEP echoed with its upstream transcription factor C/EBPβ, and it was progressively increased from ApoE−/−, 3xTg to 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice. Depletion of C/EBPβ prominently diminished active AEP levels from 3xTg/ApoE −/− mice. Consequently, APP N585 and Tau N368, proteolytic products from AEP cleavage, mirrored the upstream active AEP levels (Fig. 4A). Quantification revealed that AEP enzymatic activities tightly coupled with IB results of active AEP (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, Aβ40 and 42 concentrations in the brains were gradually augmented from ApoE−/− mice to 3xTg and climaxed in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, and they were lessened when C/EBPβ or AEP was deleted from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 4C). IF co-staining validated that both C/EBPβ and AEP fluorescent intensities in NeuN-positive neurons faithfully reflected their protein levels in IB analysis (Fig. 4D, E). Consequently, AEP-truncated Tau N368 fragment and its hyperphosphorylated AT8 signals were prominently augmented in 3xTg mice as compared to ApoE−/− mice, which were further elevated in 3xTg/AEP−/− mice. Accordingly, inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling diminished Tau N368 fragmentation and Tau hyperphosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 4A, C). Silver staining validated that the proteinaceous inclusions in the hippocampus correlated with Aβ42 and p-Tau activities (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Subsequently, TUNEL/NeuN co-staining demonstrated that neuronal apoptosis closely fluctuated with AEP levels with peaked apoptotic activity in 3xTg/ApoE −/− mice, and deletion of C/EBPβ/AEP pronouncedly attenuated neuronal cell death in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Fig. 4F, G). Golgi staining showed that the dendritic spines in the hippocampus were greatly reduced in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice as compared to 3xTg or ApoE −/− mice, and inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling alleviated these effects (Supplementary Fig. 4D, E). Morris water maze (MWM) and fear conditioning tests indicated that the learning latency was progressively escalated from ApoE−/− to 3xTg and paramount in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, and this defect was alleviated when C/EBPβ or AEP was deleted. On the other hand, the probe trial showed the inverse pattern with 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice spending the least time in the target platform quadrant (Fig. 4H–J), supporting that 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice possess the worst learning and memory defects. Fear conditioning tests also displayed the same cognitive dysfunctions for 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, and knockout of C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice significantly ameliorated the cognitive disorders (Fig. 4K, L).

Eradication of ApoE from the hippocampus of 3xTg diminishes cerebral blood flow and vascular pathology

To further define cerebral ATH’s pathological roles in AD pathologies, we employed 3xTg, 3xTg/C/EBPβ+/− and 3xTg/AEP−/− mice and injected AAV-shRNA to specifically knock down mouse ApoE in the hippocampus, followed by HFD treatment for another 2 months. The initial body weights were comparable among the groups regardless of ApoE deletion or not. However, elimination of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway from 3xTg significantly reduced body weights at the end of HFD treatment, no matter whether ApoE was eradicated from the hippocampus or not. The body weight gain ratios displayed the similar pattern (Supplementary Fig. 5A–C). Noticeably, inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling significantly lowered serum LDL but not serum cholesterol levels in 3xTg mice, treated with control AAV in the hippocampus. It is worth noting that both serum cholesterol and LDL levels were reduced in 3xTg/AEP−/− as compared to 3xTg mice. By contrast, serum HDL levels remained stable regardless of the manipulation (Supplementary Fig. 5D–F). Oil Red staining of aorta revealed that the negligible lesion areas were similar among the groups of mice, indicating that knockdown of hippocampal ApoE does not affect the aorta lesions in 3xTg mice (Supplementary Fig. 5G). IB analysis showed that ApoE in the hippocampus was greatly depleted by AAV-shRNA and reduced in the cortex, whereas ApoE in the liver remain unchanged. Quantitative analysis revealed that ApoE levels in the serum measured by elisa kit were the same in the control virus and AAV-shRNA treated animals (Supplementary Fig. 5H, I). Laser Doppler flowmetry heatmaps revealed that inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in 3xTg mice increased CBF. Notably, deletion of ApoE from the hippocampus of 3xTg strongly reduced CBF, which was alleviated when C/EBPβ or AEP was annihilated from these animals (Fig. 5A, B). IF co-staining with FITC-Albumin or anti-Aβ indicated that knockdown of ApoE in 3xTg mice strongly decreased blood vessel length, which was significantly rescued by inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway. Again, vascular Aβ deposits inversely coupled to the CBF activities and vessel length (Fig. 5C–E). 4HNE staining demonstrated that the oxidative stress was greatly augmented, when ApoE was knocked down in the hippocampus of 3xTg; and it was significantly repressed, when C/EBPβ or AEP was depleted (Fig. 5F, G). As expected, active microglia cells in the hippocampus were enhanced in 3xTg mice, when ApoE was knocked down, in alignment with ApoE’s anti-oxidative activity [43]. Deletion of C/EBPβ or AEP from these animals robustly subdued the neuroinflammation (Fig. 5H–J). Together, these data indicate that eradication of ApoE from the hippocampus of 3xTg mice elicits cerebral ATH and brain hypoperfusion, associated with robust oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, which are alleviated by inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway.

Knockout of C/EBPβ or AEP alleviates hippocampal ApoE eradication-induced AD pathologies in 3xTg mice

Next, we examined AD-related biochemical effects in these animals. IB analysis showed that knockdown of ApoE in 3xTg mice prominently elevated p-C/EBPβ and C/EBPβ, which led to escalation of downstream target AEP. Consequently, APP N585 and Tau N368 fragmentation was evidently increased. These events were lessened or blocked in 3xTg/C/EBPβ+/− or 3xTg/AEP−/− mice (Fig. 6A). AEP enzymatic activities tightly correlated with the protein levels of active AEP truncate in the IB analysis (Fig. 6B). Both Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations were significantly augmented in 3xTg mice, when ApoE was knocked down from the hippocampus. Inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling strongly diminished the polypeptides (Fig. 6C). IF co-staining confirmed that knockdown of ApoE evidently elevated C/EBPβ and AEP expression in NeuN-positive neurons in 3xTg mice, associated with robust TUNEL-positive neuronal apoptosis, which was clearly ameliorated by deleting C/EBPβ or AEP (Fig. 6D–G). IF co-staining showed that AEP-cleaved Tau N368 and p-Tau AT8 activities in the hippocampus of 3xTg mice were greatly increased, when ApoE was eradicated. These effects were suppressed when C/EBPβ/AEP pathway was impaired (Supplementary Fig. 6A, C). Silver staining echoed the aggregation-prone Aβ42 and p-Tau signals (Supplementary Fig. 6B). Golgi staining revealed that the dendritic spines were strongly reduced in the hippocampus of 3xTg mice, when ApoE was depleted. Again, Inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in these mice significantly rescued the dendritic spine’s loss (Supplementary Fig. 6D, E). MWM and fear conditioning cognitive tests showed that the learning and memory functions were pronouncedly crippled in 3xTg mice, when ApoE was knocked down. Inactivation of C/EBPβ or AEP in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice robustly rescued the cognitive defects (Fig. 6H–L). Therefore, knockdown of ApoE in the hippocampus 3xTg mice enhances Aβ concentrations and neuronal degeneration, triggering cognitive dysfunctions, for which C/EBPβ/AEP pathway is indispensable.

DISCUSSION

In the present work, we employ the well-established ATH animal model ApoE−/− mice, fed with HFD, and delete C/EBPβ or AEP from this mouse model, respectively, and demonstrate that inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP pathway substantially diminishes oxLDL, inflammation, macrophages and lesion areas in the proximal aorta and the coronary artery. These observations indicate that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling is implicated in ATH pathogenesis, fitting with previous reports [23–26, 33]. AD and ATH represent a spectrum of related conditions, with vascular involvement as a common predisposing factor, although the site of vascular involvement differs between the two diseases. Noticeably, we show that 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice demonstrate impaired CBF, accompanied with shorten vessel lengths in the brain. Inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice alleviates these vascular disorders. We made the similar observations by local depletion of ApoE from the hippocampus in 3xTg mice (Figs. 3 and 5). These findings demonstrate that ApoE plays an essential role in mediating cerebral vasculature dysfunctions in both ATH and AD, supporting that ATH-induced brain hypoperfusion contributes to the pathological manifestations of AD.

ApoE is polymorphic in humans, and plasma LDL cholesterol levels and ATH risk are both strongly associated with the three common ApoE isoforms in the order of apoE4 &gt; apoE3 &gt; apoE2 [44]. In addition to its roles in lipoprotein clearance, cholesterol efflux, and modulation of inflammation, ApoE also has anti-oxidative activity. Oxidative stress, especially oxidized LDL, is thought to be an important initiator of atherogenesis [43]. ApoE protein in a complex with lipid-rich lipoprotein particles carry largely insoluble cholesterol [12]. Hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for both diseases, and mutations leading to hyperlipidemia are major risk factors for ATH. In AD, the situation is complicated because individuals with hypercholesterolemia generally die at a younger age; but, for example, early signs of cognitive impairment increase seven folds in patients with hyperlipidemia due to low-density lipoprotein receptor mutations [45]. Most recently, we have reported that C/EBPβ acts as a crucial transcription factor for ApoE. Knockout of C/EBPβ in AD mouse models diminishes ApoE expression and Aβ pathologies, whereas overexpression of C/EBPβ accelerates AD pathologies. Remarkably, C/EBPβ selectively promotes more ApoE4 expression versus ApoE3 in human neurons, correlating with higher activation of C/EBPβ in human AD brains with ApoE4/4 compared to ApoE3/3 [46]. Consequently, we find that inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in macrophages diminishes cholesterol uptake and cholesterol-laden CD68+ macrophages in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2).

Advanced human plaques are characterized by a large necrotic core, various lipids and activated macrophages, few SMCs, intraplaque neovascularization and hemorrhages, and a thin fibrous cap that separates the plaque from the blood stream [1]. Rupture of the fibrous cap of the vulnerable plaques leads to luminal thrombosis, arterial occlusion or embolism in distant vascular beds, resulting in MI, stroke or sudden death [47]. Both AD and ATH are associated with vascular wall thickening and blood vessel occlusion. The predominant localizations differ (major arteries in ATH, cerebral arterial vasculature in AD); the pathways leading to disease may also differ. In ATH, vascular deposits impair heart function and are at significant risk of entering the circulation, leading to stroke. In AD, the brain hypoperfusion has been causally associated with disease [48]. Presumably, thickening of the cerebro-vasculature leads to impaired O2 and nutrient delivery to the brain, predisposing to neuronal loss. The lesions in the Apoe−/− mice are characterized by vascular inflammation associated with the infiltration of macrophages and other immune cells. They have been widely employed as a platform for the study of various potential mediators or inhibitors of ATH [43]. Employing 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, fed with HFD for 2 months, we find that CBF activities are drastically reduced as compared to ApoE−/− mice or 3xTg mice, respectively. Deletion of C/EBPβ or AEP from 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice greatly enhances blood vessel length in the brain and alleviates the cerebral hypoperfusion impairment, attenuating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, leading to potent suppression of neuronal cell death (Figs. 3 and 4). Remarkably, deletion of ApoE in the hippocampus of 3xTg mice also demonstrate the similar cerebral vascular effects, which are rescued by inactivation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling (Figs. 5 and 6).

AD is characterized by cerebral Aβ deposits and NFT, whereas pathologic vascular occlusion is the hallmark of ATH. ATH development is accompanied by disruption of the EC layer, VSMC migration, and matrix calcification. Onset is a little earlier than for AD, but ultimately affects a similar proportion of the elderly. In AD, Aβ is associated with macrophages and the cerebro-vasculature, notably in CAA (cerebral amyloid angiopathy), and reduced cerebral blood flow occurs in AD mouse brains [49]. Macrophages ingesting Aβ is implicated in shuttling Aβ between blood vessels and neurons, mediating CAA formation [50]. In alignment with prominent C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, APP N585 and Tau N368 are robustly cleaved by active AEP, leading to escalation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Fig. 4). Notably, vascular Aβ deposits in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice are tightly correlated with these effects (Fig. 3E). APP and its toxic fragment, Aβ, are deeply implicated in ATH. Serum Aβ levels are elevated in stroke patients [51] and Aβ exerts toxic effects on the vascular endothelium [52, 53]. Human ATH lesions contain Aβ [7]. It has been reported that expression of AD-related APP in a strain of ATH-prone mice leads to aortic ATH [8], and atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE knockout mice are significantly increased by overexpression of AD-related mutant APP [9]. Conversely, deletion of APP reduces ATH plaque size by up to 90% in ATH-prone ApoE−/− mice [10], underscoring that APP plays a prominent role in ATH. 3xTg mice harbor human PS1M146V, APPswe, and Tau P301L mutant transgenes [54]. Consequently, crossing 3xTg with ApoE−/− mice accelerates ATH pathologies, accompanied with augmented vascular Aβ deposits and neuronal apoptosis, aggravating AD pathologies and cognitive deficits (Figs. 3 and 4). However, when crossed to an ApoE−/− background, no amyloid deposits are found in any brain region of transgenic APP (V717F) AD mice [55]. Vascular pathology is observed in two different lines of APP AD transgenic mice, but when the lines are crossed to ApoE knockout animals, vascular Aβ pathology is abolished in both strains of APP AD/ApoE−/− mice, even at old age of animals [56]. Reduced AD-like pathology in ApoE knockout mice has been confirmed [57]. It remains unknown why these mice display phenotypes are very different from what we observe in 3xTg/ApoE−/− (Figs. 3 and 4). As far as we know, the pathological crosstalk between ATH and AD has never been explored in 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice. Employing C/EBPβ+/− and AEP−/− mice to breed with 3xTg/ApoE−/− mice, we have defined the pathological roles of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling in both ATH and AD disorders onset and progression. Utilizing viral shRNA deletion of ApoE in the hippocampus of 3xTg, 3xTg/C/EBPβ+/− or 3xTg/AEP−/− mice, we have pinned down the pathological roles of ApoE in vascular pathology and vascular Aβ deposits independent of its cardiovascular functions. In both models, we show that C/EBPβ/AEP signaling is required for coupling ATH to AD (Figs. 5 and 6). Indeed, deletion of ApoE in 3xTg mice significantly decreases blood flow in the brain with upregulation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling. Without analysis of the lipid deposition in the blood vessel in the brain, ApoE deletion in the brain cannot be considered as an ATH model. AAV-shRNA injection into the hippocampus greatly eradicates ApoE from the hippocampus and reduces ApoE from the cortex without affecting ApoE in the periphery system (Supplementary Fig. 5H, I), which may shed the light into brain blood flow reduction with ApoE decrease in the brain. This observation is similar to what we found in the brain of 3xTg/ApoE−/−, suggesting that brain but not periphery ApoE plays an essential role in modulating brain blood flow. Hence, our findings indicate that peripheral ApoE and low level of brain ApoE are sufficient to prevent lipid increases induced by the high-fat diet, which may point to a lipid-independent mechanism of brain ApoE in mediating the brain blood flow and AD pathologies. Cerebrovascular Aβ accumulation, namely CAA, is implicated in the incidence and development of AD and cognitive impairment, and CAA is commonly observed in AD with a prevalence of about 80–90% [58]. Since ApoE4 is associated with cerebral microbleeds and is a strong genetic risk factor for both AD and CAA, ApoE reduction in the brain (resembling ApoE−/−) somehow mimics ApoE4 pathological functions, diminishing brain blood flow.

Mounting evidence shows that APP and Aβ, implicated in both AD and ATH, are themselves involved in oxysterol metabolism. In AD plaques, Aβ colocalizes with deposits of ApoE and cholesterol [59]. Significantly elevated levels of 3-oxidized cholesterols are reported in the brains of APP AD mice and in postmortem brain tissue of AD patients [60]. 3- (or 7-) oxidation has potential to modulate the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in foam cells, although the major sterol in advanced ATH plaque appears to be 27-OHC (&gt;80% esterified) [61, 62]. Most recently, we report that ApoE4 and 27-OHC additively activate C/EBPβ/AEP signaling, driving AD pathogenesis. This effect is dependent on neuronal secreted Aβ and inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of cholesterol metabolism with lovastatin diminishes neuronal ApoE4’s stimulatory effects. Notably, 27-OHC strongly activates C/EBPβ/AEP pathway in human ApoE4-TR mice and triggers AD pathologies and cognitive deficits [35]. These exciting results are in accordance with previous findings in human patients. For instance, in apoε4 carriers, a higher ratio of 27-OHC to cholesterol is related to poor memory performance [63]. In a cohort study, ApoE 4/4 AD patients treated with statins show better cognitive functions. The use of statins may benefit all AD patients with potentially greater therapeutic efficacy in those homozygous for ApoE4 [64]. Because ATH and AD share a similar etiology, drugs effective in one disorder might be expected to show efficacy in the other. Statins reduce body excess of cholesterol by inhibiting a key enzyme in de novo cholesterol synthesis, HMG CoA reductase. No conclusive benefits have been reported in AD [65]. However, it has been reported that statins are beneficiary for AD patients with ApoE4 allele [64]. For ATH, some benefits have been reported, notably in the ASTEROID trial of rosuvastatin [66, 67]. Since C/EBPβ/AEP pathway is intimately implicated in both disorders, presumably, AEP inhibitors may be used as disease-modifying therapeutic agents for treating both diseases.
