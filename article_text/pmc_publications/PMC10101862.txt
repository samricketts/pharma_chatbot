INTRODUCTION:

Mild to moderate exercise may decrease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, but the effects of vigorous, regular physical exercise remain unclear.

METHODS:

Two patients with initial diagnoses of amnestic MCI demonstrated positive AD biomarkers throughout 16 and 8 years of follow-up with final diagnoses of mild AD and amnestic MCI, respectively.

RESULTS:

Patient 1 was diagnosed with amnestic MCI at age 64. Neuropsychological testing, MRI, FDG PET, amyloid imaging PET and CSF biomarkers during follow-ups remained consistent with AD. By age 80, progression was minimal with MOCA 26/30. Patient 2 was diagnosed with amnestic MCI at age 72. Neuropsychological testing, MRI, FDG PET and amyloid imaging PET during follow-ups remained consistent with AD. At age 80, MOCA was 27/30 with no clinical progression. Both patients regularly performed vigorous, regular exercise that increased after retirement/work reduction.

DISCUSSION:

Vigorous, regular exercise may slow disease progression in biomarker-positive amnestic MCI and mild AD.


pmcIntroduction

Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may show minimal short-term improvement in cognitive functioning with cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, but modification of the progressive disease course is difficult to achieve.1 Among lifestyle factors, physical exercise is associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment and AD.2,3 Self-reported moderate physical exercise is associated with decreased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)2 and regular walking in middle-aged adults is associated with decreased dementia risk.3 In MCI, which is often a precursor to AD, aerobic exercise has shown positive effects on cognition and physical functioning,4 but in the EXERT study moderate aerobic exercise did not differ from stretching exercises in cognitive outcomes over 12 months.5

In an observational study of patients with AD, greater duration of physical exercise was associated with less cognitive and functional decline over 3 years.6 In controlled clinical trials, however, physical exercise has not consistently slowed cognitive decline in AD.7,8 Among recent meta-analyses, one found some evidence of a beneficial effect of physical exercise for cognitive symptoms in AD,7 but another did not.8 This discrepancy may be related to differing selection criteria for studies in meta-analyses, partly because of marked heterogeneity in physical exercise interventions and lack of blindness of raters in most studies.7,8

Nearly all published studies have evaluated mild to moderate exercise for a few months to two years without regular exercise being required during the entire follow-up period.7 Therefore, the potential disease-modifying effect of vigorous, regular physical exercise over several years to decades in AD is unknown.

We report on two patients who received an initial diagnosis of amnestic MCI, had positive AD biomarkers, and were evaluated regularly during 16 and 8 years of follow-up, respectively. At last follow-up, their diagnoses were mild AD and amnestic MCI, respectively, with minimal cognitive and functional decline during follow-up. Upon review of possible contributors to their strikingly benign, atypical clinical course, we identified vigorous, regular exercise as the likely disease-modifying factor.

Methods

Both patients were evaluated at New York University Langone Health (NYULH) Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment. During recent follow-ups, they participated in an NIA-supported multicenter clinical trial, VALAD, which is led by Columbia University (D.P.D.). VALAD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (blind will be maintained until end-2023) that compares valacyclovir to placebo in patients with clinical AD dementia who are seropositive for herpes simplex virus 1 or 2.9 Both patients’ clinical and research records were reviewed by A.V.M. and cross-checked by T.W., who has been their neurologist. Both patients and their spouses were interviewed to obtain complete information that was confirmed by the research team, including clarification of any discrepancies.

Results

The demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, and AD biomarker results for both patients are described in Table 1.

Patient 1 presented at age 64 with memory complaints at another hospital and received a clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI. Neuropsychological testing revealed impairment in visual memory and executive function. MRI and FDG PET were unremarkable. All subsequent follow-up visits were conducted at NYULH. Neuropsychological testing at 1- to 3-year intervals consistently revealed cognitive deficits with extremely slow cognitive decline. At age 67, FDG PET showed decreased parietotemporal metabolism consistent with an AD etiology and this finding persisted with repeat FDG PET and HMPAO SPECT scans during the subsequent decade (Table 1). CSF biomarkers obtained at age 69 supported an AD etiology (Table 1). Follow-up MRI scans revealed atrophy in several brain regions and progressive left temporal atrophy, mild cerebrovascular disease and a small, stable meningioma. From age 76 to 78, he participated in VALAD. In the trial, at pre-randomization, Florbetapir PET scan was read radiologically as amyloid positive. Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) was 1.56 with cerebellar reference, ascertained by established research methods10 (Table 1). Folstein MMSE score declined from 28/30 to 25/30 during the last 10 years of follow-up.

He had treated atrial fibrillation, thyroid disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. A lawyer and judge, he retired at age 75. He played bridge regularly and always handled his own finances. His exercise regimen involved general physical activity and playing tennis regularly which increased after retirement to 4 to 6 times per week, averaging 2 hours on each occasion. He and his wife reported that he is an intense, competitive tennis player.

Patient 2 presented with memory complaints at age 72. Neuropsychological testing revealed memory impairment consistent with amnestic MCI. MRI showed atrophy and a likely venous malformation in the superior lateral aspect of the right intraconal orbit. FDG PET showed bilateral temporoparietal hypometabolism consistent with an AD etiology. The clinical diagnosis was amnestic MCI likely due to AD. At age 76, neuropsychological testing showed marked anterograde memory impairment with initial encoding followed by rapid forgetting. MRI and FDG PET abnormalities were unchanged (Table 1). Amyloid PET scans were read as positive for AD: Florbetapir PET at age 73 and Flutemetamol at age 75. In the VALAD trial, pre-randomization Florbetapir PET scan was read radiologically as positive for AD and SUVR was 1.93 (Table 1). His clinical diagnosis remained amnestic MCI with Folstein MMSE changing from 27 to 26 over 8 years. MOCA scores were in the normal range at age 77 (26/30) and age 79 (27/30).

He had gout, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, and a history of Lyme’s disease successfully treated with doxycycline. He reduced his work as an engineering management consultant from full-time to part-time at age 75. His intense exercise regimen included daily use of elliptical trainer, treadmill and cycling with Peloton, plus tennis and golf whenever possible. After shifting from full-time to part-time consulting work, he engaged in intense physical exercise for 3-4 hours daily (golf excluded), which was confirmed by his wife.

Discussion

The two patients had initial clinical diagnoses of amnestic MCI with final follow-up diagnoses of mild AD and amnestic MCI, respectively. Both patients were biomarker positive for AD with CSF markers (Patient 1) and temporoparietal hypometabolism with FDG PET and abnormally elevated amyloid PET SUVR values (Patients 1 and 2), confirming an AD etiology.11 Global cognitive measures showed minimal to no progression during follow-up. Annual MMSE declines averaged 0.3 points for patient 1 and 0.125 points for patient 2, which contrasts with average 2-point MMSE annual decline in patients with mild to moderate AD.12 At recent follow-ups, MOCA scores for both patients were in the normal range for age. Further, both patients showed minimal to no functional decline. Clinical trials of mild to moderate exercise in AD suggest a possible beneficial effect in some studies but several studies have not shown efficacy.7,8 The two patients reported here suggest that vigorous, regular exercise, which has not been studied systematically in MCI or AD, may be needed to slow disease progression in biomarker-positive amnestic MCI or mild AD.

Both patients had multiple medical disorders and were not “super-normal” in their general health status. The patients’ intense exercise regimens may have reduced the likelihood of worsening of microvascular disease on MRI brain scans. Both patients had a high level of education, maintenance of cognitive-enhancing activities with cognitive reserve, and an active social life. These factors may have contributed to the lack of disease progression. However, with the increased time available after retirement and reduction in work schedule, respectively, both patients did not increase their cognitive activities but rather became more engaged in vigorous, regular physical exercise. Cognitive training may have a small beneficial effect in MCI, but efficacy has not been demonstrated consistently in AD.13 Diet was unremarkable in both patients and unlikely to have contributed to slow disease progression. Both patients had the apo E 3/3 genotype (Table 1). Apo E e3/3 may be associated with less cognitive deterioration than apoE e4 (hetero- or homozygous) in AD, but the disease course is not altered appreciably.14

Intense exercise increases both anaerobic and aerobic metabolism with increase in blood flow and oxygenation.15 Animal models demonstrate that exercise is associated with increased production of BNDF, VEGF, GDNF, IGF-I, and FNDC5/irisin, which are neurotrophic factors that stimulate the processes of angiogenesis, synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and mitochondrial biogenesis.16 In humans, anti-aging/AD genes show increased expression with physical activity with overrepresentation of genes involved in mitochondrial energy production, synaptic function, axonal function and myelin integrity.17 Clearly, physical activity has widespread beneficial neurobiological effects. Clinically, physical exercise has other positive effects that include reduction in falls, improved cardiovascular function and decreased mortality.6,18

Few older adults, however, engage in vigorous, regular physical exercise, largely because of comorbidities and frailty.15 Vigorous, regular exercise may work particularly well as a disease-modifying strategy in individuals with regular exercise routines who can intensify their exercise regimens. The patients’ clinical course suggests that the gradient of moderate exercise being better than mild exercise in patients with MCI needs to be extended to vigorous, regular, long-term exercise to slow disease progression in biomarker-positive amnestic MCI and AD.3

Many adults remain largely unaware of the associations between lifestyle activities, including physical exercise, and brain health and illness.19 This case series has led to an innovative observation with implications for a future clinical trial using intense exercise as an exposure of interest. If the findings are confirmed in a larger clinical trial, widespread adoption of this approach is likely with major public health implications. Finally, delaying AD disease progression by even a few years will lead to enormous healthcare and societal cost-savings.20

Research in Context

Systematic review: Based on the clinical course of the two patients in this brief report, the authors reviewed the literature using traditional (e.g., PubMed) sources and meeting abstracts and presentations. Recent meta-analyses on the effects of exercise in MCI and AD are appropriately cited.

Interpretation: Our findings suggest that vigorous, regular exercise over many years to decades, which has not been studied systematically, may slow disease progression in amnestic MCI and mild AD.

Future directions: If this initial report leads to future prospective, controlled studies which confirm that vigorous, sustained exercise can slow disease progression, widespread adoption of this approach is likely with major public health implications. Delaying AD disease progression by even a few years will lead to enormous healthcare and societal cost-savings.
