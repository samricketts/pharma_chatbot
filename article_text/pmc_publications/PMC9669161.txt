Background:

Dementia with Lewy bodies is a neurodegenerative disease, sharing features with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. We report a case of a patient Dementia with Lewy bodies carrying combined PSEN1 and ATP7B mutations.

Case:

A man developed Dementia with Lewy bodies starting at the age of 60 years. CSF biomarkers were of Alzheimer’s Disease and DaTSCAN was abnormal. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous p.Ile408Thr PSEN1 variant and a homozygous p.Arg616Trp ATP7B variant.

Conclusions:

This case reinstates the need of considering ATP7B mutations when evaluating a patient with parkinsonism and supports p.Ile408Thr as a pathogenic PSEN1 variant.

pmc1. Introduction

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disease that shares clinical, pathological and genetic features with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mixed pathology is frequent in these patients, hindering its appropriate diagnostic, leaving many patients misdiagnosed1. In fact, pathologically, brains of DLB patients show widespread Lewy Body pathology, but most also have neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques sufficient to meet the neuropathological criteria for AD2. These findings place DLB midway along a spectrum between PD and AD3. On a genetic perspective, DLB remains mostly elusive4. To date, there are no Mendelian genes specific to DLB that are not causative for other diseases 5. The genes implicated in DLB risk are those associated with AD or PD, such as APOE, SNCA and GBA5. In addition, there have been DLB cases associated with APP and PSEN16, some of them established by pathological diagnosis. However, DLB heritability is estimated to be 59.9% and most of it is still unexplained7. Here, we report a clinical DLB case with a genetic diagnosis established by whole-exome sequencing (WES), showing a combination of a heterozygous mutation of PSEN1 and homozygous mutation of ATP7B.

2. Materials and methods

Informed consent was obtained from the spouse of the patient. This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the regional ethical review board in Coimbra, Portugal (CE-029/2019). We confirm that we have read the Journal’s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this work is consistent with those guidelines.

WES was performed as detailed below and sequencing results were analyzed through exomiser. Prioritized variants were then analyzed for phenotype coherence by literature review. The mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. DNA was extracted from blood. Briefly, WES was performed on a HiSeq2500 with 100 bp pair-end reads after library preparation with the SureSelect Exome Capture Kit v4 (Agilent). Exome processing was accomplished following the GenomeAnalysisTK best practices through executing the alignment with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (bwa-mem) v0.7.12 against the hg19 genome assembly, identifying duplicates with samblaster v0.1.21 and recalibrating bases with GenomeAnalysisTK v3.8–1 8. Variant Quality Score Recalibration9, and annotation with snpEff v4.2 and dbNSFP v2.9 were applied to all variants10, 11. Variants were filtered according to their quality metrics described by Patel and collaborators12. Variants were prioritized using the standard parameters in Exomiser v11.0.013 (table 2), with the following human phenotype ontology (HPO) identifiers for the disorder Dementia, Lewy Body (OMIM:127750)14: HP:0000746 (delusions), HP:0000726 (dementia), HP:000236 (visual hallucinations), HP:0007159 (fluctuations in consciousness), HP:0001300 (parkinsonism), HP:0100315 (Lewy bodies). Candidate variants were Sanger sequenced on a 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Primers are available upon request.

CSF was collected as part of the routine clinical diagnostic protocol. Pre-analytical and analytical procedures were done in accordance with the Alzheimer’s Association guidelines for CSF biomarker determination 15. CSF samples are routinely collected in sterile polypropylene tubes, immediately centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 minutes at 4ºC, aliquoted into polypropylene tubes and stored at –80ºC until analysis. CSF Aβ42, T-tau and P-tau were measured separately by commercially available sandwich ELISA kits (Innotest, Fujirebio, Belgium), as previously described 16, 17. External quality control of the assays was performed under the scope of the Alzheimer’s Association Quality Control Program for CSF Biomarkers15, 16.

3. Results

We report a case of a caucasian male engineer, with 15 years of education. He started developing apathy and memory complaints at 60 years. He showed some emotional blunting and bradyphrenia. His spouse admitted some fluctuation. No family history of dementia or parkinsonism was reported. He only had history of a lumbar hernia surgery and colour blindness. He later died at the age of 62.

On baseline neuropsychological evaluation, he had a MoCA of 25/30. He had moderate changes in attention tasks, and mild impairment in memory, with a severe impairment in verbal memory, both in immediate and delayed recall, with a more profound impairment in the latter. He also had some visuoconstructive impairment. On baseline neuropsychological evaluation, he had a MoCA of 25/30. He had moderate changes in attention tasks, psychomotor control and working memory (severe impairment in trail making tests A and B); some difficulties with abstract reasoning (Raven Progressive Matrices – set AB), although with a borderline normal score, and mild impairment in memory (Weschler Memory Scale, specifically in the verbal memory, with a moderate immediate recall impairment and a severe impairment in delayed recall; and a mild visual memory impairment). He also had some visuoconstructive impairment (mild impairment in the Clock-drawing test and cube and flower figures copy).

MRI showed bilateral temporal atrophy with a mild degree of leukoencephalopathy. (fig.1 A and B). No typical MRI features of Wilson’s Disease (WD) were identified. A lumbar puncture was performed, revealing reduced levels of β-amyloid (257.1pg/mL, N&gt;542pg/mL), increased levels of Tau (384.4pg/mL, N&lt;212pg/mL) and phosphorylated Tau (78.0pg/mL, N&lt;32pg/mL). Together, these support the diagnosis of AD according to the A/T/N criteria18. However, the patient started to develop parkinsonism, with a left asymmetric tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. A DaTSCAN revealed a right deficit in dopamine uptake (fig. 1 C). The early-onset parkinsonism, associated with the profile of both frontal and mesial cognitive involvement and cognitive fluctuation led to the establishment of the diagnosis of DLB, according to the most recent criteria2.

Considering the age of onset, a genetic study was performed. Routine apolipoprotein E genotyping revealed the ɛ3/ɛ4 genotype. WES revealed variants in two genes of interest which were previously reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic: a heterozygous variant in PSEN1 (p.Ile408Thr) and a homozygous variant in ATP7B (p.Arg616Trp). Considering the age of onset, a genetic study was performed. Routine apolipoprotein E genotyping revealed the ɛ3/ɛ4 genotype. WES revealed variants in two genes of interest which were previously reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic: a heterozygous variant in PSEN1 (p.Ile408Thr)19 and a homozygous variant in ATP7B (p.Arg616Trp)20.

Unfortunately, the patient developed an aggressive lung cancer, his condition deteriorated and he later died, preventing further studies.

4. Discussion

DLB is typically associated with an older age of onset21. An early-onset increases the likelihood of an underlying genetic change. We report a case where two genetic changes may have concurred: one heterozygous mutation in PSEN1 and one homozygous mutation in ATP7B.

Cognitive impairment in WD is characterized by predominant involvement of executive functions, reflecting involvement of fronto-striatal circuits22, and attention23. This overlaps with the cognitive changes in DLB. Although there has been no case report on a homozygous p.Arg616Trp patient with this variant, it has been reported in compound heterozygous WD patients20. This variant has been recently demonstrated to severely affect copper transportation efficiency24, 25. Noteworthy, corresponding mutations in the ATP7B homolog ATP7A have been associated with Menkes disease26. Additionally, ATP7B p.Arg616Gln, a variant changing the same residue, is also pathogenic27. Unfortunately, due to the early death of the patient, we did not have the opportunity to assess copper or ceruloplasmin levels, but the presence of parkinsonism, supported by a positive DaTSCAN adds some support to the role of these mutations on the phenotype.

The PSEN1 p.Ile408Thr variant has been described only in one Italian family, where three sisters and their mother were affected, although only two sisters were tested, both carrying the mutation19. It is predicted to be pathogenic in silico and it is not present in neuropathologically healthy control28. In our case, CSF biomarkers are supportive of amyloid pathology, indicating a role for this mutation in the phenotype of the patient. However, the residue is not conserved in PSEN2 and it is unclear if it fits the helix rule29. Yet, most models consider hydrophobic region 9 (where Ile408 sits) to form a transmembrane helix29, 30. The fact that changes in p.Ile408Thr neighbouring residues (p.Ala409Thr31 and p.Cys410Tyr32) are considered to be pathogenic and that the amount of pathogenic variants in this region has been increasing adds support to the pathogenic role of the probands’ variant.

The previously reported patients harbouring this variant show a slightly different phenotype19. Both sisters had late-onset AD and none had parkinsonism. One may speculate that the concurrent effect of both variants (heterozygous PSEN1 p.Ile408Thr and homozygous ATP7B p.Arg616Trp) may have led to the observed phenotype. On one hand, PSEN1 p.Ile408Thr leads to amyloid deposition and AD, and, on the other, ATP7B p.Arg6161Trp may both hasten the age of onset as well as push it towards a more DLB-like phenotype, causing the parkinsonism. In addition, PSEN1 knockdowns are associated with increased copper tolerance33. PSEN1 dysfunction in this patient might explain the rather late onset of WD, as it may delay copper accumulation.

Noteworthy, the Apolipoprotein E ɛ3/ɛ4 genotype is also a risk for both AD34 and DLB35. Yet, this risk factor tends to be more associated with later onset cases34, 36 and it is probably not enough to explain this early onset disease.

This case reinforces the need of high suspicion of ATP7B mutations in the context of parkinsonism, even in the setting of a DLB phenotype, as it is a treatable disorder. In addition, the finding of a PSEN1 p.Ile408Thr variant in this patient adds further evidence of its pathogenicity.
