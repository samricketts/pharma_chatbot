To understand how glia may be altered in frontotemporal degeneration with tau pathology (FTD-tau), we used a NanoString glial profiling panel to measure 770 transcripts related to glial biology in human control (n = 8), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (n = 8), and FTD-tau (n = 8) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Compared to control, 43 genes were upregulated and 86 genes were downregulated in the FTD-tau samples. Only 3 genes were upregulated and 2 were downregulated in AD. Pathway analysis revealed many astrocyte-, microglia-, and oligodendrocyte-related pathway scores increased in FTD-tau, while neuron-related pathway scores decreased. We compared these results to a previously published proteomic dataset containing many of the same samples and found that the targeted panel approach obtained measurements for genes whose proteins were not measured in the proteomics. Our results point to the utility of multi-omic approaches and marked dysregulation of glia in FTD-tau.

pmc1. Introduction

Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a clinically, pathologically, and genetically heterogeneous spectrum of disorders characterized by protein accumulations and degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes (Olney et al., 2017; Onyike and Huey, 2013). As the second most common form of dementia in people under 65 years of age, FTD results in a dramatic deviation from the neurotypical aging process (Onyike and Diehl-Schmid, 2013). Symptoms include a variety of behavioral and personality changes, memory impairments, and language deficits (Olney et al., 2017; Woollacott and Rohrer, 2016). Almost half of all FTD cases have abnormal accumulations of tau (FTD-tau). FTD-tau can be sporadic or inherited due to mutations in the gene that encodes for the tau protein, microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) (Hock and Polymenidou, 2016; Oeckl et al., 2016). In FTD-tau, tau can accumulate in neurons as well as in glia, particularly in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Ghetti et al., 2015; Taniguchi et al., 2004). Whether glial tau pathology arises via cell autonomous or cell non-autonomous mechanisms is debated (Li and Haney, 2020), and the role of glia in tau-mediated neurodegenerative processes is an active topic of investigation.

Previously, we used tandem mass tagged (TMT) labeling and mass spectrometry to examine the total proteome of human control and tauopathy brain, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and FTD-tau (Gutierrez-Quiceno et al., 2021). Through differential expression and cell subtype analysis, we identified unique enrichment of glial proteins, particularly astrocytic and microglial proteins, in the FTD-tau samples relative to control. However, whether this enrichment reflects a proliferation of glial cells or a transition in the protein expression profile of glial cells is unclear. Furthermore, if this enrichment does indeed reflect a change in the molecular profile of these glial cells, it is unknown if this profile is similar to previously published phenotypes of glial cells such as A1/A2 astrocytes (Liddelow et al., 2017) or disease associated microglia (DAM) (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017). These and other characterizations of glial molecular profiles are most often defined by RNA expression (Clarke et al., 2018; Diaz-Castro et al., 2019; Zamanian et al., 2012). Since, transcriptomic and proteomic data are often discordant (Mangleburg et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019), we sought to further examine glia in FTD-tau using a targeted, transcriptomic approach.

To determine how glia in FTD-tau may differ from those in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and control human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we used the NanoString nCounter glial profiling panel to examine the expression of 770 genes involved in glial biology. We then compared this targeted transcriptome with the corresponding proteome to determine concordance and to measure unique glial transcriptomic changes. Defining similar and unique proteome to transcriptome changes could provide additional insights into FTD pathophysiology.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Collection of postmortem brain tissue

Postmortem brain tissue was obtained from the Emory Goizueta Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center Neuropathology Brain Bank in Atlanta, Georgia. Brains were collected from deceased subjects following Institutional Review Board protocols under which consent was obtained from the subjects’ family. Brain hemispheres were separated such that one hemisphere was stored in coronal sections at −80 °C and the other hemisphere was fixed for immunohistochemistry. For this study, we used samples of DLPFC from fresh, frozen human brain. Research subjects were selected based on neuropathological diagnosis (control, AD, and FTD-tau) and demographics. Neuropathological diagnosis was carried out by board-certified neuropathologists and was determined via standard immunohistochemical methods including hematoxylin, eosin, and silver-staining as well as more targeted labeling for amyloid beta 42, hyperphosphorylated tau, alpha-synuclein, and phosphorylated TDP43. The AD samples were all Braak stage VI and had a CERAD score of 3. The FTD-tau group was composed of six samples collected from subjects with a mutation in the MAPT gene, and two samples collected from subjects with a neuropathological diagnosis of Pick’s disease. Five of the donors had P301L tau mutations and one donor had an R406W tau mutation. The P301L MAPT mutation generates primarily 4R tau pathology (Hutton et al., 1998) while R406W a mixed 3R/4R tau pathology (Ghetti et al., 2015). Pick’s disease is a 3R tauopathy (Delacourte et al., 1998). Samples were matched across disease group for age and sex (Table 1).

2.2 RNA isolation and NanoString nCounter glial profiling panel

30 to 50 milligrams of frozen DLPFC, primarily gray matter, was homogenized in one milliliter of Trizol with a bullet blender. Chloroform and centrifugation were used to obtain an aqueous phase containing RNA. The aqueous phase was mixed 1:1 in 100% ethanol and then processed with the Quick-RNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, USA). RNA was eluted in nuclease free water and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Quality of the RNA was determined by the Emory Integrated Genomics Core. All samples had concentrations greater than 20 ng/ul and DV200 values greater than 20%, per manufacturer’s recommendation. Samples from each disease group were randomly distributed across two nCounter Human glial profiling panels (NanoString, USA) and run on an nCounter FLEX Analysis System (NanoString, USA).

2.3 Analysis of glial profiling panel results and comparison with corresponding proteome

Raw data were imported into nSolver 4.0 and analyzed via the nCounter Advanced Analysis plugin (version 2.1.134) to normalize the data (Supplementary File S.1) and conduct differential expression (Supplementary File S.2), pathway scoring (Supplementary File S.3), and cell type profiling analyses (Supplementary File S.4). Covariates included disease (control, AD, and FTD-tau) and cartridge ID (to control for batch effects). All samples passed the quality control analysis conducted by the Advanced Analysis plugin (Figure 1A). Differential expression was calculated using disease as the predictor variable and the cartridge ID as the confounder variable. P-values were adjusted for multiple tests using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) method.

We performed comparisons between the results of the glial profiling panel and a published proteomic dataset that included 11 out of 24 of the samples used for the glial panel (Gutierrez-Quiceno et al., 2021). First, we compared the number of genes measured (above threshold) via the glial panel with the number of proteins measured in our proteomic experiments, prior to batch correction. We then compared the number of above threshold genes with the number of measured proteins after batch correction. We also compared the number of significant differentially expressed genes with the number of significant differentially expressed proteins. Finally, we correlated log2 fold change values of differentially expressed genes and proteins in FTD-tau.

2.4 Statistical analysis and visualization methods

R (version 4.1.1) was used for statistical analysis and data visualization. To test for a difference in mean pathway score and cell type score between groups, we used One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and p-values were adjusted for multiple tests using the BY method. We used pairwise t-tests for post-hoc comparisons and used the BY method to adjust for multiple tests. Correlations were performed using the Pearson method. Boxplots and scatterplots were created using the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) and venn diagrams were created using the VennDiagram package (Chen and Boutros, 2011). Gene ontology (GO) analyses were conducted using the gprofiler2 package using the g:SCS multiple testing correction with significance threshold of .05 (Raudvere et al., 2019).

3. Results

3.1 Glia- and neuron-associated transcripts display opposite patterns of differential expression in FTD-tau relative to control.

We previously performed TMT quantitative proteomics on human DLPFC and temporal cortex on 83 samples of tauopathy including CTE, FTD-tau (inherited and sporadic), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), as well as control cases (Gutierrez-Quiceno et al., 2021). Through differential expression and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA), we found that FTD-tau and FTDMAPT samples were enriched with glia-associated proteins, especially from astrocytes (Gutierrez-Quiceno et al., 2021). Whether this pattern of increased glia associated proteins was also reflected in the transcriptome was unclear. To assess the expression of glial-specific genes in FTD-tau, we used a glial profiling panel to measure 770 genes related to glial biology in human control (N = 8), AD (N=8), and FTD-tau (N=8) brain. No significant differences were found between groups in post-mortem interval (PMI), APOE genotype, and race (Table 1). Samples loosely clustered by disease group but not by cartridge ID (Figure 1A). Expression data were normalized (Figure 1B, Supplementary File S.1) for subsequent differential expression and pathway analysis (Figures 2 – 6). Finally, histograms of p-value frequency with co-variates cartridge ID (Figure 1C) and disease group (Figure 1D) showed that disease group is associated with lower (more significant) p-values while cartridge ID was not, indicating that there was not a significant batch effect on expression data.

For differential expression analysis, the AD and the FTD-tau groups were compared separately to the control group (Supplementary File S.2). Three genes were upregulated, and two genes were downregulated in AD relative to control (Figures 2A, 2C). When comparing FTD-tau to control, 43 genes were upregulated and 86 genes were downregulated (Figures 2B, 2D, and 2E). Interestingly, 10 of the 20 most upregulated (by log2 fold change value) genes in FTD-tau relative to control were a part of at least one astrocyte-related pathway (Figure 2D). A majority of the top 20 most downregulated genes (by log2 fold change value) in FTD-tau relative to control were associated with pathways related to neuronal signaling, synapses, and cytoskeletal dynamics (Figure 2E).

3.2 Glia-associated, particularly astrocytic, pathway scores, are increased in FTD-tau samples relative to control.

Next, we compared the pathway scores of the samples in each disease group to gain a higher-level understanding of how differential expression patterns between disease groups impacted biological processes (Supplementary File S.3). Pathway scores are greatly influenced by differential expression, and increased scores typically represent elevated expression of the pathway genes. Out of 55 total pathways, there were significant differences between disease groups in 39 pathways (Table B.1). Post-hoc testing revealed that there was a significant difference between control and FTD-tau in all 39 of the significant pathways but no significant differences between control and AD nor AD and FTD-tau.

3.2.1 Neuronal pathways

Most pathway scores were lower in the FTD-tau group relative to control for neuronal processes. Representative pathways like neuroactive ligands and receptors (Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C) and neurotrophin signaling (Figures 3D, 3E, and 3F) displayed this pattern of gene expression. In both pathways, all but one of the FTD-tau samples clustered together (Figures 3A and 3D). The FTD-tau group had lower neuroactive ligands and receptors (Figure 3B) and neurotrophin signaling pathway (Figure 3E) scores. The decrease in the neuroactive ligand and receptor pathway scores in the FTD-tau group relative to control is driven by a significant differential decrease in expression of glycine, glutamate, and GABA receptors and receptor subunits (GLRA3, GABRA4, GABRG2, GABRB3, GRIA3) which were decreased by log2 fold change values of −1.41 (BY p-value = 0.00546), −1.2 (BY p-value = 0.00647), −1.74 (BY p-value = 0.0193), −1.16 (BY p-value = 0.0338), and −0.98 (BY p-value = 0.0193), respectively (Figure 3C). The decrease in the neurotrophin signaling pathway scores in the FTD-tau group relative to control is driven by a significant differential decrease in expression of the kinases glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3B) and cyclin dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1 (CDK5R1) as well as SHC-transforming protein 3 (SHC3), which were decreased by log2 fold change values of −0.558 (BY p-value = 0.00689), −0.867 (BY p-value = 0.0227), and −0.925 (BY p-value = 0.0181), respectively (Figure 3F).

3.2.2 Oligodendrocyte pathways

Conversely, pathway scores were higher in the FTD-tau group relative to control for pathways associated with oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes. Representative pathways like oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C) and myelogenesis (Figures 4D, 4E, and 4F) displayed this pattern of gene expression. In both pathways, all but two of the FTD-tau samples clustered together (Figures 4A and 4D). The FTD-tau group had higher oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation (Figure 4B) and myelogenesis pathway (Figure 4E) scores. The increased oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation pathway scores in the FTD-tau group were likely driven by the increased differential expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) and gelsolin (GSN), which were upregulated by a log2 fold change value of 1.34 (BY p-value = 0.00647) and 1.7 (BY p-value = 0.00514), respectively (Figure 4C). The increased myelogenesis pathway scores in the FTD-tau group are driven by the increased differential expression of peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) which was upregulated by a log2 fold change value of 1 (BY p-value = 0.0108).

3.2.3 Microglial pathways

For microglia, representative pathways included microglial markers (Figures 5A, 5B, and 5C) and primed microglia (Figures 5D, 5E, and 5F). FTD-tau samples tended to cluster near the AD samples (Figures 5A and 5D). The FTD-tau group had higher microglial markers (Figure 5B) and primed microglia pathway (Figure 5E) scores relative to control. Both pathways shared increased differential expression of several genes including of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and ras homolog family member B (RHOB) which were increased by a log2 fold change value of 1.53 (BY p-value = 0.00679), and 1.22 (BY p-value = 0.0334), respectively. Additionally, the increased microglial markers pathway scores in the FTD-tau group were also driven by the increased differential expression of plexin domain containing 2 (PLXDC2), and MAF BZIP transcription factor B (MAFB) which were upregulated by a log2 fold change value of 1.12 (BY p-value = 0.00514) and 0.973 (BY p-value = 0.00647), respectively (Figure 5C). The increased primed microglia pathway scores in the FTD-tau group were also driven by increased differential expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and granulin (GRN) which were upregulated by a log2 fold change value of 1.82 (BY p-value = 0.00514) and 0.849 (BY p-value = 0.00514), respectively (Figure 5F).

3.2.4 Astrocyte pathways

Finally, for astrocytes, representative pathways included astrocyte differentiation and function (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6C) and astrocyte markers (Figures 6D, 6E, and 6F). In these pathways, the FTD-tau groups did not cluster as well together but the heatmaps showed increased expression for many of the genes in these pathways (Figures 6A and 6D). The FTD-tau group had higher astrocyte differentiation and function (Figure 6B) and astrocyte markers pathway (Figure 6E) scores relative to control. Both pathways shared increased differential expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) which was increased by a log2 fold change value of 2.78 (BY p-value = 0.00514). In fact, GFAP was the most upregulated gene (by log2 fold change value) in the FTD-tau group relative to control. Additionally, the increased astrocyte differentiation and function pathway scores in the FTD-tau group relative to control were driven by increased differential expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) which were increased by a log2 fold change value of 1.18 (BY p-value = 0.00514) and 1.46 (BY p-value = 0.00647), respectively (Figure 6C). The increased astrocyte markers pathway scores in the FTD-tau group relative to control were driven by increased differential expression of complement component 4 A/B (C4A/B) and ADCYAP receptor type 1 (ADCYAP1R1) which were increased by a log2 fold change value of 2.75 (BY p-value = 0.00514) and 1.18 (BY p-value = 0.00514), respectively (Figure 6F).

3.3 Cell type analysis reveals enrichment of astrocytic transcripts in FTD-tau.

We used a cell type analysis to determine whether the disease group impacted enrichment or depletion of specific cell types (Table B.2, Supplementary File S.4). Quality control (Figure 7A) led us to focus only on astrocytes (Figure 7B), endothelial cells (Figure 7C), macrophages and microglia (Figure 7D), and oligodendrocytes (Figure 7E). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, the only significant difference in cell type score between disease groups was identified in astrocytes (one way ANOVA p = .01319). Post-hoc testing determined that the FTD-tau group was enriched in astrocytic transcripts relative to the control (adjusted p-value = 0.000527) and AD (adjusted p-value = 0.02915) groups. This significant increase in astrocyte cell type score follows the same pattern of increase as observed in astrocytic pathways (Figure 6) and is likely driven by increased expression of known astrocyte markers.

3.4 Comparison of proteomic and glial profiling panel results

Finally, we examined the concordance between the transcriptomic and proteomic approaches (Gutierrez-Quiceno et al., 2021). There were 584 genes/proteins common (overlapping) between the above threshold genes in the glial panel and all the proteins measured (prior to batch correction) (Figure 8A). 103 genes were measured by the glial panel that were not measured in the proteomic experiments (unique glial panel). Gene ontology (GO) analyses of the unique glial panel genes and the overlapping genes/proteins revealed that the unique glial panel genes were more likely to encode for proteins that localize to the plasma membrane (Figure 8A, A.1). This pattern of unique glial panel genes being primarily membrane-bound continued when we compared our glial panel dataset to only proteins that survived batch correction (Figure 8B, A.2). However, when we compared only significant genes and proteins, this pattern disappeared and the GO terms for cellular component were more heterogeneous (Figure 8C, A.3).

Finally, the log2 fold change values of genes and proteins were positively correlated (Figure 9A, Pearson’s r = .515, p &lt; 2.2 × 10−16). We also found that fold change values of genes/proteins with significant differential expression were more positively correlated (Figure 9B, Pearson’s r = .798, p = 3.84 × 10−12). This was surprising given that transcriptomic and proteomic concordance is often poor (Mangleburg et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019). There were more significant downregulated genes/proteins common to both datasets than significant upregulated genes/proteins. There were two significant genes that had opposite patterns of expression in the glial panel versus the proteomic dataset (Figure 9C).

4. Discussion

In this study, we profiled glial-associated transcripts in human control, AD, and FTD-tau post-mortem brain to understand how glial cells and their molecular profiles differ between control and neurodegenerative states. We identified differentially expressed genes in the FTD-tau group relative to control, but few in the AD group. Pathway analysis revealed that neuronal processes were decreased in the FTD-tau group while astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and microglial pathways were increased. Interestingly, the AD samples often had intermediate pathway scores between control and FTD-tau samples suggesting that FTD-tau may represent a more extreme form of tauopathy with substantially more glial involvement. Finally, comparing fold change values in the targeted glial transcriptome to brain proteome revealed a significant positive correlation.

4.1 Comparison of glial profiling panel with proteomic data yields novel insights.

Although we were surprised by the concordance between the glial panel and the proteomic data given that there is often a mismatch between RNA and protein measurements, we also identified genes for which we did not obtain protein-level data. There were 103 genes measured by the glial panel that were not detected in the proteome. The third and fifth most upregulated genes in the FTD-tau samples, S100A12 and IL18, did not survive batch correction for the proteome. Many of the genes not measured in the proteomic study predominantly encoded for membrane proteins. RNA and protein measurements often do not correlate well due to differences in factors such as turnover rate, degradation, regulation, and extraction methods, all of which could also explain the unique glial panel genes in our comparison of the two datasets (Liu et al., 2016; Vogel and Marcotte, 2012). The results of this study point to the utility of multi-omic approaches to gather more complete measurements of a sample and to gain deeper insight on the molecular underpinnings of disease.

4.2 Robust differential expression of astrocytic and inflammatory genes in FTD-tau

The five most upregulated genes in FTD-tau (GFAP, C4A/B, S100A12, CD163, and IL18) were previously associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The majority of these genes specifically associated with AD, but some were studied in relation to tau and tau pathology. For example, C4, a complement protein, was identified in subjects with Pick’s disease (Singhrao et al., 1996). Other components of the complement pathway were upregulated in FTD-tau, including C3 and C1q, and were previously implicated in mouse models of tau-mediated neurodegeneration (Litvinchuk et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). The complement pathway scores of our FTD-tau samples also trended toward significance (one-way ANOVA adjusted p-value = .055). IL18 may impact expression of tau kinases and hyperphosphorylated tau (Ojala et al., 2008) and is also a downstream effector of the NLRP3 inflammasome (van de Veerdonk et al., 2011). In our study, FTD-tau samples had higher inflammasome pathway scores than control (Table B.1). Indeed, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a mouse model of FTD-tau triggered a small reduction in phosphorylated tau (Hull et al., 2020). While this approach was targeted to genes associated with glial cells, the upregulated genes in FTD-tau implicate inflammatory processes and glial cells in the pathogenesis of FTD-tau.

Like the five most upregulated genes, the five most downregulated genes in FTD-tau (RIMS1, EGR1, RAB3A, GABRG2, and NEFL) were also previously associated with neurodegenerative disease. Synaptic proteins like RIMS1, RAB3A, and GABRG2 were reduced in other neurodegenerative states, likely due to the loss of neurons (and their synapses). EGR1 is a transcription factor widely studied in the fields of cancer and AD (Gómez Ravetti et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Prior literature implicated EGR1 in the phosphorylation of tau through activation of Cdk5 (Lu et al., 2011), thus modulating EGR1 may be a useful way to target tau pathology therapeutically. NEFL is a cytoskeletal protein associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (DiVincenzo et al., 2014; Sainio et al., 2018). NEFL in serum, plasma, and CSF has been widely studied for its potential as a biomarker for neurodegenerative disease, including for FTD (Halbgebauer et al., 2021; Lim et al., 2021; Schmitz et al., 2021; Silva-Spínola et al., 2021). In sum, the downregulated genes reflect the state of neurodegeneration and dysregulated processes such as synaptic function and cytoskeletal dynamics.

4.3 Glial pathways are increased in FTD-tau

Pathway analysis identified multiple FTD-tau associated pathways. We observed that neuronal pathways were primarily decreased in FTD-tau and pathway scores associated with oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia were increased. Of note, the astrocyte differentiation and function pathway scores had the largest F-value after one-way ANOVA analysis. Driven by a significant upregulation of GFAP, EGFR, TLR4, and GRN, it seems that astrocyte function is markedly and uniquely dysregulated in our FTD-tau group. Astrocytes express low levels of endogenous tau, but tau can aggregate in astrocytes, along with other non-neuronal cell types (Ghetti et al., 2015; Kovacs et al., 2017; LoPresti et al., 1995; Sharma et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014). One study using IPSC-derived astrocytes from subjects with MAPT mutations reported alterations in function such as increased vulnerability to oxidative stress as well as increased expression of 4R tau (Hallmann et al., 2017). Considering the results from this study as well as the prior literature, future work should continue to focus on understanding the role of astrocytes in FTD-tau, particularly in cases where MAPT mutations are present. In addition to these cell-type specific observations, many pathways that are already known to be dysregulated in FTD-tau and other neurodegenerative diseases had significantly different pathway scores in the FTD-tau samples, including autophagy, phagocytosis, cytoskeletal dynamics, insulin signaling, and Wnt signaling, among others.

While statistical analysis did not reveal any significant differences in pathway scores between FTD-tau and AD samples, the mean pathway score for the AD samples tended to be midway between the means of the control and FTD-tau pathway scores. It is possible that since the FTD-tau samples were more homogenous (6 out of 8 of the samples were from subjects with a MAPT mutation) and the AD samples were more heterogeneous, the variability contributed to this observed pattern in the pathway scores. It is also possible that FTD-tau may represent a more extreme form a tauopathy which could contribute to this pattern as well. This pattern is similar to what we observed in our proteomic dataset, especially regarding astrocytic proteins (Gutierrez-Quiceno et al., 2021).

4.4 Limitations and future studies

There were several limitations to this work that are important to consider. The sample size of 24 individual brains, 8 per disease condition, is small. Our FTD-tau group was primarily composed of samples from subjects with a mutation in MAPT (6 out of 8 samples) and this group was compared to AD samples from subjects who had sporadic (or non-familial) AD in our pathway analyses. The prevalence of MAPT mutation cases in our FTD-tau group could make the group more homogenous, thus improving the chances of identifying significant changes. Another limitation of this study is that we did not have sufficient power to differentiate between 3R and 4R tauopathy in our FTD-tau group. Future studies could include larger groups of distinct 3R and 4R tauopathies to help discern the unique impacts that 3R or 4R tau pathology have on glial gene expression. A targeted transcriptomic approach with the glial profiling panel was chosen given the intriguing FTD-tau glial proteomic findings, particularly with astrocytes. This method was also attractive due to the available analysis pipelines and the lower cost relative to other sequencing approaches. However, unbiased RNA sequencing as well as single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing could be considered in the future to explore additional disease-related findings with increased cell-type specificity. Future studies could also include an additional group of samples from subjects with only sporadic FTD-tau. Furthermore, this study did not include samples from subjects with FTD mediated by non-tau pathology (e.g., TDP-43, FUS, etc.). Future work should include these other sub-groups of FTD to determine whether this glial enrichment is specific to FTD-tau.

5. Conclusion

Understanding how glia contribute to neurodegenerative disease is both an understudied topic but also a growing question within the field. We asked how glia may be altered in human FTD-tau DLPFC. Differential expression and pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of glial transcripts in FTD-tau samples, but not AD. Scores for the astrocyte markers and astrocyte differentiation and function pathways were especially increased in FTD-tau samples. This increase in pathway scores was driven by a robust upregulation of astrocytic genes like GFAP, C4A/B, ADCYAP1R1, and others. After comparison of the glial panel results with the brain proteome, we found that the targeted glial panel allowed us to measure genes that were not detected or did not survive batch correction in the proteomic dataset. Furthermore, our glial profiling panel results and the proteomic dataset correlated well. Multi-omic approaches such as this are useful to capture more complete data. Overall, glial cells and their processes appear to be more dysregulated in FTD-tau than in AD.

Boxplots of cell type scores (astrocytes (B), endothelial cells (C), macrophages and microglia (D) and oligodendrocytes (E)) for each sample. Only cellular populations whose markers were significantly correlated (A) are shown. Astrocytes are enriched in the FTD-tau group (One-way ANOVA adjusted p-value = .013 relative to control (adjusted p-value = 0.000527) and AD (adjusted p-value = 0.02915) brain. * indicates post-hoc p-value &lt; .05.

Figure 8. Genes unique to the glial profiling panel are associated with membrane-related cellular component GO terms.

Up to the 20 most significant cellular component GO terms are displayed on the left for genes unique to the glial profiling panel and on the right for genes that were measured in both datasets. Comparisons include above threshold genes in the glial profiling panel with all measured proteins (prior to batch correction) (A) and only proteins that survived batch correction (B). Finally, only significant differentially expressed genes in the glial profiling panel and proteins were compared (C), where the tendency for the unique glial profiling panel genes to be localized to the membrane disappeared.

Figure 9. Significant differentially expressed transcripts and proteins in FTD-tau relative to control brain are positively correlated.

Scatterplot of log2 fold change values for differentially expressed transcripts (x-axis) and proteins (y-axis) as measured by the glial panel and quantitative proteomic analysis (A). Points vary in color based on whether the transcript/protein was significant in the two datasets. The purple dashed line indicates a perfect correlation while the black line indicates the line of best fit for the data. The log2 fold change values of the glial panel and proteomic datasets are positively correlated (Pearson’s r = .515, p &lt; 2.2 × 10−16). Log2 fold change values of only transcripts/proteins that are significant in both datasets are more positively correlated (Pearson’s r = .798, p = 3.84 × 10−12) (B). Table highlighting the expression pattern of significant transcripts/proteins that are common between both datasets (C).
