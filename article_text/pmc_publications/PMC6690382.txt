Amyloid β (Aβ)-dependent neuronal hyperactivity is believed to contribute to the circuit dysfunction which characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis continues to accrue, the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. Here we used mouse models of Aβ-amyloidosis, to show that hyperactivation is initiated by the suppression of glutamate reuptake. Hyperactivity occurred in neurons with pre-existing baseline activity, whereas inactive neurons were generally resistant to Aβ-mediated hyperactivation. Aβ-containing AD brain extracts and purified Aβ dimers were able to sustain this vicious cycle. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism of Aβ-dependent neuronal dysfunction that can be active prior to plaque formation.

One Sentence Summary:

Mechanism of Aβ-dependent neuronal hyperactivity.


Main Text:

The progressive buildup of Aβ in the brains of AD patients is a firmly established experimental observation (1,2). The consequences of this buildup are manifold and include synaptic dysfunction, inflammation and, ultimately, cell death (3,4). On the systems level, functional brain changes such as impaired neuronal activity and disturbed brain metabolism have been associated with Aβ-amyloidosis (5–7). Several lines of evidence indicate that neuronal hyperactivity is a potential key feature of early stages of AD. Both in mice and man there is strong evidence of excessive neuronal activation that under certain conditions can induce epileptic seizures (8–10). Functional imaging studies in individuals with prodromal AD reveals increased neuronal activity in the hippocampus and some neocortical areas (6). The cellular correlates of this hyperactivity have been studied in mouse models of Aβ-amyloidosis using two-photon calcium imaging (11,12) and implicate an essential role for soluble Aβ (11).

An open question for understanding AD pathology is how soluble Aβ mediates cellular dysfunction such as hyperactivity. A large number of possible Aβ “receptors” have been suggested (13) but their roles in neuronal dysfunction in vivo has not been elucidated. Ample evidence points towards an Aβ-dependent impairment at both inhibitory (5, 8, 10) and excitatory (14–17) synapses. Specifically, an impairment of glutamate homeostasis is evident in rodents (18–21) and humans (22,23) and might underlie the disturbed plasticity of hippocampal synapses (18, 19). However, the link between impaired glutamate homeostasis and neuronal function in vivo is unclear. Here, we explored the mechanism of Aβ-dependent neuronal hyperactivation and the forms of soluble Aβ which mediate this cellular dysfunction.

Neuronal hyperactivity requires pre-existing baseline activity

We used two-photon Ca2+ imaging of hippocampal CA1 neurons in vivo (11) (Fig. S1, A–C) to test the direct action of soluble Aβ. Synthetic Aβ(1–40)S26C, in which the naturally occurring serine at position 26 was replaced with cysteine, was used to produce and test the effects of the disulphide cross-linked dimer [AβS26C]2 (24, 25). [AβS26C]2 was pressure applied near the CA1 hippocampal pyramidal layer of 1–2 month-old wild-type (WT) mice. In most neurons application of 500 nM [AβS26C]2 induced reversibly a massive increase in activity similar to the hyperactivity seen in APP transgenic mice (11) (Fig. 1A, control experiments in fig. S1D and E). Intriguingly, applications of [AβS26C]2 were ineffective in hippocampal slices (Fig. 1B, fig. S2, A and B). A possible explanation for these apparently contradictory findings was that the neuronal ‘baseline’ activity was greatly reduced in hippocampal slices compared to in vivo (fig. S2, C and D). Here, to test the role of baseline activity for Aβ-induced neuronal hyperactivation we performed ‘loss’-of-(dys)function experiments in the hippocampus of WT mice in vivo and ‘gain’-of-(dys)function in hippocampal slices. First, we demonstrated that application of [AβS26C]2 was ineffective when blocking in vivo neuronal activity by antagonists ionotropic glutamate receptors (Fig. 1C, E) or by the sodium channel antagonist tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Fig. S3). Next, we turned to the analysis of hippocampal slices in vitro and did opposite experiments in which we induced in vivo-like baseline activity through various pharmacological manipulations. Treatments included: (1) block of GABAergic synaptic inhibition by bicuculline, (2) addition of glutamate to the bath, (3) elevation of the extracellular K+ concentration, and (4) combinations of these manipulations. Each of these treatments induced an average baseline activity that was similar to that detected under in vivo conditions (fig. S4A). Baseline activity increased in the presence of bicuculline in 5 representative neurons as illustrated in Fig. 1D, left. In these conditions, the application of [AβS26C]2 resulted in a reversible increase of additional activity (Fig. 1D, F). A similar effect was observed by the addition of low levels of glutamate (Fig. 1G) or by the elevation of the extracellular potassium concentration (Fig. 1H, for controls see fig. S4B–D). In studies on the Aβ-dependence of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) (e.g. (19, 24)) or long-term depression (LTD) (e.g. (18, 26)), an increase of baseline activity is probably not necessary, because the induction protocols for synaptic plasticity involve increased levels of activity. In conclusion, our in vitro experiments support the in vivo observations and indicate that increased levels of baseline activity are a pre-requisite for [AβS26C]2-induced hyperactivity. Cell-by-cell analyses show that, despite a considerable variance, there is on average a positive correlation between baseline activity and the degree of hyperactivation (Fig. 1I, fig. S4E).

Hyperactivation through an Aβ-dependent block of glutamate reuptake

Under in vivo conditions neuronal activity generated by glutamatergic excitation was required for [AβS26C]2-induced hyperactivity (Fig. 1C). In our search for a cause underlying a synaptic potentiation we considered pre-and postsynaptic mechanisms. To investigate if [AβS26C]2 acted pre-synaptically, we performed paired-pulse facilitation experiments and tested for possible changes of presynaptic release probability of glutamate (27). Application of [AβS26C]2 had no detectable impact on paired-pulse facilitation (fig. S5), as expected (18, 24, 28). An alternative hypothesis was inspired by reports on an Aβ-dependent defect of the glutamate homeostasis, possibly involving an impairment of glutamate reuptake (18–20). In a first step, we tested whether pharmacologically blocking glutamate uptake in vivo had any detectable effect on neuronal activity. For this, we used the unspecific glutamate uptake blocker DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA), which can mimic some effects of Aβ on activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in vitro (18,19). The local application of TBOA to hippocampal CA1 neurons in WT mice induced neuronal hyperactivity (Fig. 2A and B), an effect that was similar to that observed with [AβS26C]2 applications (Fig. 1A and E, Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, [AβS26C]2 and TBOA may have exerted their actions through different mechanisms. To address this issue, we repeated the experiments in the transgenic APP23 x PS45 mouse model of Aβ-amyloidosis (12). We used young mice with no obvious amyloid plaques, but high levels of soluble Aβ (12) and a pronounced hippocampal hyperactivity (11) (Fig. 2D and E; fig. S6). Application of TBOA had a strong hyperactivating action in WT mice (Fig. 2F) but almost no effect in APP23 x PS45 mice (Fig. 2G and I). Applications of [AβS26C]2 were also ineffective in APP23 x PS45 mice (Fig. 2, H and J). Thus, endogenous Aβ largely occluded both TBOA or [AβS26C]2-induced hyperactivation.

Strong enhancement of synaptic stimulation-evoked glutamate transients through Aβ

To further test this glutamate accumulation hypothesis, we used two-photon glutamate imaging involving the viral expression of the fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFr (29). For this purpose, an iGluSnFr viral construct was injected unilaterally into the hippocampal CA1 region in vivo (Fig. 3A), leading after three weeks to a strong and dense neuronal expression of iGluSnFr (Fig. 3B). In parallel, we also performed as controls sparse labelling experiments of CA1 pyramidal neurons (Fig. 3C). In order to induce synaptic glutamate release, we electrically stimulated a bundle of afferent Schaffer collateral axons in hippocampal slices. We performed two-photon glutamate imaging and collected the bulk response in a region of interest (Fig. 3D, inset), which covered a substantial part of the glutamate sensor-expressing dendrites of CA1 neurons (Fig. 3C). Single-shock stimulation produced large transient increases in extracellular glutamate concentration (Fig. S7A, control experiments in fig. S7B and C). Local application of Aβ produced a strong and reversible potentiation of the glutamate transients (Fig 3D and E, fig. S7D). Similar glutamate transients were induced by applications of TBOA (Fig 3F and G, fig. S7D). Thus, peri-synaptic glutamate accumulations, through impaired uptake of synaptically-released glutamate, may drive Aβ-dependent hyperactivity. In line with this conclusion, whole-cell recordings of NMDA receptor-dependent excitatory postsynaptic currents (NMDA-epscs) in CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices (30) were similarly affected by both TBOA and [AβS26C]2 (fig. S8). Together, these results demonstrate that TBOA and [AβS26C]2 act through a similar, yet unknown, molecular mechanism.

The astro-glial excitatory amino-acid transporter (EAAT)-2 (also termed GLT-1 in mice) is the predominant EAAT in the hippocampal CA1 region. Therefore, we tested whether Aβ interferes with EAAT2-mediated glutamate uptake. First, we tested the GLT-1 antagonist Dihydrokainic acid (DHK) in WT mice. Similar to TBOA and [AβS26C]2, DHK caused robust neuronal hyperactivity (fig. S9A and B). Furthermore, the cross-linking GLT-1 antibody (GLT-1 AB) also induced hyperactivity (Fig. 3H and I, for controls see fig. S9C and D). Cross-linking GLT-1 ABs can impair glutamate uptake by obstructing lateral membrane diffusion of glutamate/GLT-1 complexes along astrocytic protrusions out of the synaptic cleft - a process suggested to be essential for clearing synaptically released glutamate (31). Our results using DHK, GLT1 and Aβ suggest that the Aβ-dependent block of glutamate reuptake may not involve Aβ binding to transporter proteins, but rather perturbation of astrocytic membrane dynamics and obstruction of GLT-1 diffusion (31).

Effectiveness of human Aβ species derived from Alzheimer’s patients

To further explore the relevance of our findings to the human disease, we employed forms of Aβ derived from AD brain. First, we used Aβ-containing AD brain extracts (32). When examined by immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting, the Aβ in such brain extracts migrate on denaturing SDS-PAGE with molecular weights indicative of monomers and SDS-stable dimers. Aβ-containing AD extracts (Fig. 4A), but not those immunodepleted of Aβ (ID extract, Fig. 4B) are capable of inducing a variety of disease-relevant effects (24, 33–35). In vivo local applications of AD extract to CA1 neurons of WT mice produced a marked neuronal hyperactivity (Fig. 4C, D and F), whereas the ID extract did not induce hyperactivity (fig. S10, A and B). Similarly, when tested in vitro, AD extract induced hyperactivity in active hippocampal CA1 neurons treated with bicuculline (Fig. 4E and G), but ID extract had no effect (fig. S10C and D). Moreover, AD extract failed to cause hyperactivation in vivo in the presence of D-APV and CNQX (fig. S10E and F), or in unmanipulated hippocampal slices (fig. S10G and H).

Purified AD brain-derived cross-linked dimers can block long-term potentiation (LTP) and impair neuritic integrity (36). We thus investigated if such material (fig. S11A) could also induce hyperactivity. As a control, we isolated Aβ monomer from the same AD brain (fig. S11A). Aβ dimers, but not equimolar Aβ monomers (36, 37) (fig. S11, B–E) reduced neurite length (fig. S11, B and C) and the number of branch points (fig. S11, D and E). Similarly, the application of brain-derived Aβ dimers effectively, but reversibly, induced hyperactivity WT mice in vivo (Fig. 5A and B). Noteworthy, human Aβ dimers induced similar levels of hyperactivity at substantially lower concentrations that the synthetic ones (0.2 μg/ml human vs. 4.3 μg/ml synthetic Aβ dimers). The application of human Aβ monomers had little or no effect (Fig. 5E). The activity of dimers was highly dose-dependent, with an apparent EC50 of 27.5 ng/ml (Fig. 5C). Application of AD brain-derived Aβ dimers to bicuculline-treated mouse hippocampal slices reliably induced hyperactivity in neurons with a high baseline activity (fig. S12) and produced an activity-dependent hyperactivation in vivo (Fig 5D). Finally, when Aβ monomers were applied to hippocampal CA1 neurons they had little or no ability to induce hyperactivation both in vivo and in vitro (Fig S13).

Discussion and conclusions

In this study, we characterized rapid actions of synthetic and AD brain-derived Aβ on the activity of mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that Aβ can induce hyperexcitation in sensitive neurons and that this drives a vicious cycle of hyperactivation (Fig. 5F). To explain the scheme, we start out with the insight that there is a simple solution to the puzzle that Aβ-dependent hyperactivity is readily observed in vivo, but not in vitro. We were able to show that there is an absolute need of ongoing activity for the induction of Aβ-dependent synaptic hyperactivation. Next, the block of synaptically-released glutamate at active excitatory synapses is an important element of the vicious cycle. The third component of the cycle is excessive peri-synaptic accumulation of glutamate. The final element of the cycle is revealed by the dependence of the increase in hyperactivation on the level of baseline activity, both for synthetic and human brain-derived Aβ dimers. It is important to note that this process of amplification appears to be self-limited at high levels of hyperactivity, as indicated by the results of the occlusion experiments. Thus, multiple lines of evidence underscore the role of all four elements of the cycle.

While the dependence of hyperactivation on impaired excitatory synaptic transmission involving defective glutamate reuptake had not previously been predicted, there is prior evidence for impaired glutamate homeostasis both in rodents (18–21) and AD patients (22,23). Furthermore, there is evidence for beneficial effects of certain anti-glutamatergic drugs, such as memantine, against AD (20, 38–40). It is suggested that these drugs may act peri-synaptically on extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (40). Moreover, this process may be aggravated by pathologically-reduced expression levels of glutamate transporters, such as EAAT2 in AD patients (22) or by reduced levels of synaptic inhibition (5, 8, 10). Finally, it is important to stress that Aβ-dependent hyperactivity precedes plaque formation and that it is present at early stages, long before overt clinical symptoms of AD (6). A gradual neuronal “silencing” occurs after plaques are formed and may be the prelude to neurodegeneration (41). While functional deficits of circuits caused by massive degeneration are nearly impossible to be repaired with current approaches, it may be possible to therapeutically target hyperactivation at early stages of the disease by lowering Aβ levels, reducing neuronal activity by enhancing synaptic inhibition, or by pharmacological manipulations of EAATs.
