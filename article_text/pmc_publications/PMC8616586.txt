Abnormal accumulation of inorganic trace elements in a human brain, such as iron, zinc and aluminium, oftentimes manifested as deposits and accompanied by a chemical valence change, is pathologically relevant to various neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, Fe2+ has been hypothesized to produce free radicals that induce oxidative damage and eventually cause Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, traditional biomedical techniques, e.g. histology staining, are limited in studying the chemical composition and valence states of these inorganic deposits. We apply commonly used physical (phys-) science methods such as X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), focused-ion beam (FIB) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology and optical microscopy (OM) to study the valence states of iron deposits in AD patients. Ferrous ions are found in all deposits in brain tissues from three AD patients, constituting 0.22–0.50 of the whole iron content in each specimen. Such phystechniques are rarely used in medical science and have great potential to provide unique insight into biomedical problems.

pmc1. Introduction

Electron microscopy (EM) is an extensively used tool in both biological (bio-) and physical (phys-) fields. However it is not so usual that bio-methods (e.g. cryo-, staining, microtoming) are employed in the physical sciences, and likewise common phys-methods like scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray energy dispersive (EDS) or electron energy loss spectroscopic (EELS) analyses are rarely applied in the medical sciences. Over several years we have made several contributions of the latter to the former. For instance Koh et al. characterized composite organic-inorganic nanoparticles on leukemia cells uisng a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Auger and EDS analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [1]. Kempen et al. used STEM to analyze large volumes of tissue to detect silica-coated Au nanoparticles [2], contributing to several studies utilizing nanotechnology for early cancer detection [3–6]. They further showed the efficacy of correlative optical and scanning electron microscopy [7], or SEM and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) [8] for such evaluations. Li et al. [9] used high resolution TEM imaging to investigate the structure-property relationships of graphite-encapsulated ferromagnetic nanoparticles for possible medical applications, leading to STEM-EDS mapping by Zeng et al. [10, 11] to illuminate the compositional variations within gold-iron oxide nanoparticles for cancer diagnostics and therapy. STEM-EELS has been applied by Zeng, Madsen et al. to investigate the influence of nanoparticle parameters on surface plasmon energies [12] for the application of surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection methods [13, 14]. Likewise such experiments have contributed to notable advances, particularly for early stage cancer detection and treatment [15, 16]. Some particularly well-known examples of phys-EM techniques in the biological field concern the use of holographic analysis of magnetic fields in magnetotactic bacteria [17] and various STEM techniques (EELS, EDS and tomography) and energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) in pathological tissues [18, 19].

In the current work we apply monochromated STEM-EELS, which is widely used in phys-EM, to characterize Fe2+/Fe3+ ionized states in iron deposits in the brain tissue of patients with advanced Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Key to this characterization is the use of correlative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical microscopy (OM) and SEM to assist site-specific sample preparation using focused-ion beam (FIB) instrumentation in order to isolate the deposits of interest for the detailed STEM-EELS study.

As background for the present research, it is known that inorganic trace elements, such as calcium, magnesium, chromium, iron and copper, are essential to human health [20]. However, abnormal accumulation of minerals, oftentimes manifested as deposits and accompanied by a chemical valence change, is pathologically relevant to various diseases [21], particularly in encephalopathies such as aceruloplasminaemia [22], neuroferritonopathy [23], neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders (NBIA) [24], Parkinson’s [25], Wilson’s [26] and Alzheimer’s diseases [27, 28]. The presence of abnormal quantities of zinc, aluminum and magnesium or their localization in abnormal structures in the brain, such as calcifications, plaques, and tangles has been reported in patients with Fahr’s disease [26]. Calcification of chromium was also discovered using electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) in a patient with an undiagnosed degenerative cerebral disease [29]. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning was used to investigate hippocampal calcifications among 1991 patients, but a greater degree of calcifications was not associated with lower cognitive function in patients with memory complaints [30].

Ferritins, a class of iron storage proteins that regulate the concentration of iron in a cell, form naturally occurring mineral deposits mainly comprised of hydrated iron oxide nanocrystals of approximately 5–7 nm diameter [31]. Normally the excessive iron atoms are stored as Fe3+ ions in ferritins in the typical form of ferrihydrite, however recent studies imply that abnormal ferritins forming Fe2+ deposits in the form of magnetite in the hippocampus substantia nigra, globus pallidus, caudate nucleus and cortex of the brain could be linked to pathology in Alzheimer’s disease [32, 33]. It is hypothesized that Fe2+ ions would act as a catalyst to produce toxic free radicals that induce oxidative damage and antioxidant depletion in nervous tissues[27, 34–36]. This would cause neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration that leads to synaptic and neuronal loss, ultimately manifesting as memory loss and cognitive impairment.

Therefore, it is important to determine the chemical composition and oxidation state of abnormal mineral deposits in order to understand corresponding pathological causes and eventually suggest proper treatments. In this study, we present a correlative approach that utilizes MRI, histology, OM and nano-characterization techniques including SEM, FIB, STEM and EELS to locate abnormal iron deposits and investigate the oxidation state of iron components in AD brain tissue with high spatial resolution (e.g. nanometer level). Although several notable electron microscopy and spectroscopy investigations have been performed on these iron deposits produced in the brain [31, 34, 35, 37], the samples are generally produced from homogenized tissue. In this case, the surrounding biological structure is lost, making it difficult to relate the presence of iron with signs of nervous system damage such as plaques. Correlative microscopy allows for the combination of the strengths of two or more imaging techniques. In the case of iron oxide deposits, MRI can be applied as the first characterization method to identify regions of interest. As iron oxide particles are magnetic, they act as a natural contrast agent. Prior work has shown the ability to visualize iron deposition in human brain tissue using MRI [27, 38]. Their work strongly support our motivation of using MRI for initial determination of iron deposits. Large, hydrated sections of the brain were imaged non-destructively with this method to roughly determine the location of iron oxide deposits. OM was then applied as a bridge between the moderate resolution of MRI and the high resolution, but limited imaging volume, of SEM. Additionally, fixation and immunohistochemical stains allow the use of OM to visualize ferritin cores in microglia, a neural cell type known to accumulate iron, to reduce the search area for SEM. Our future work will incorporate using frozen sections and a broader search for iron unaffected by fixative. FIB allows the precise localization and extraction of deposits of interest for subsequent STEM/TEM work at much higher magnifications. The oxidation valance state can be readily accessed by local electron energy loss spectroscopy [39–41]. This approach could also be translated to study the composition and chemical valence state of other naturally appearing deposits such as chromium and zinc [26, 29].

2. Material and methods

2.1. Tissue Acquisition

Brain tissues from deceased patients aged 83–89 with advanced AD were acquired in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (USA). Detailed procedures are described in previous work [27]. Each specimen consisted of a 3 × 3× 4 cm thick slab extracted from the medial temporal lobe in the brain including the hippocampus, subiculum and parahippocampal gyrus, and immersed in Fluorinert (3M, USA) for MRI at room temperature. Subsequently specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, followed by microtome sectioning at a thickeness of 10 μm. The tissue sections were laid flat on microscope glass slides.

2.2. MRI

Specimens (before fixation) were examined using high-resolution MRI at 7T (GE/Agilent Discovery MR901) at room temperature. Gradient echo sequences (GRE) were acquired (full sequence parameters in Supplementary Table S1). This method can be used to initially locate iron deposits non-destructively in fresh and bulk samples as iron oxide is magnetic and therefore serves as a natural T2 contrast agent for MRI. For other mineral deposits in tissues that are non-magnetic, the MRI is omitted and the evaluation proceeds directly to histology studies with proper staining as detailed in the following section.

2.3. Histology

The most common histology stain for iron is DAB-enhanced Perl’s Prussian blue. However, the main component, potassium ferricyanide, not only contains iron ions, but also reacts with ferrous (Fe2+) iron to produce the insoluble blue pigment [42]. Therefore, the standard staining approach could introduce bias and alter the experimental results. In this study, fixed and embedded specimens were dual stained for the ferritin protein and microglia instead. Since this is an immunohistochemical staining approach based on the interaction of antibody and antigen, iron deposits are known to remain structurally and biochemically intact throughout the staining process. Both types of stain show similar results in visualizing iron-containing plaques [43].

2.4. Correlative OM and SEM

Optical images of stained samples were acquired using an Aperio AT2 whole-slide scanning microscope (Leica Inc.). After OM, specimens were mounted on aluminium stubs (Ted Pella Inc.) and sputter-coated with a 5 nm thick Au-Pd conductive layer. Samples were imaged using a FEI Helios Nanolab 600i DualBeam FIB/SEM (Thermo Fisher, Hillsboro, OR). Secondary electron (SE) SEM images of the tissue morphology were taken with a 2 kV electron beam at a current from 50 pA to 1 nA.

To co-register OM and SEM images, distinctive features at various magnification were utilized. At a large field of view (on the order of several millimeters), the tissue edge is a good starting point to roughly locate the regions of interest. At medium to high magnification (field of view a few hundreds microns), blood vessels, tissue tears and pores serve as alignment marks to locate the iron deposits in an approximately 100 × 100 μm region, which can be further narrowed down using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to identify the iron locations.

2.5. SEM-EDS

In order to find the exact location of the iron deposits, EDS mapping of the tentative regions was acquired using an acceleration voltage of 15–30 keV and a beam current of 1.5–2.7 nA. The electron energy is more than double the Fe Kα peak energy in order to provide sufficient signal intensity. Besides, higher energy electrons would also penetrate the sample further, which helps locating iron deposits buried beneath the sample surface. The electron beam is fast rastered across the 100 × 100 μm region at a step size of 1 μm as a single pass, and gradually the spectrum is built up to produce a map in 50–70 passes, which takes about 30 mins in total. The choice of step size is sufficient to distinguish iron deposits against background noise as they are generally 5–10 μm in size. EDS maps were generated in the EDAX TEAM software (Ametek, Inc.) by assigning the Fe Kα peak intensity to the corresponding pixel. EDS does not have the resolution to distinguish the iron oxidation states.

2.6. Focused-ion beam (FIB) and TEM Sample Preparation

After the exact positions of iron deposits were confirmed with EDS, thin lamellae (thickness of 2 μm, length of 15 μm, and height of 5 μm) of the microtomed sections (thickness of 10 μm laying flat on glass slides) were extracted perpendicular to the specimen surface using a focused-ion beam. To protect the top surface from damage, firstly a 100 nm thick (area of 15 × 2 μm) carbon protective layer was deposited by decomposing naphthalene precursor gas using a 2 kV electron beam at a current of 0.34nA, followed by another 2 μm thick carbon layer overlapping on the same area deposited using a 30 keV gallium ion beam at a current of 80 pA, which are standard procedures. These carbon protective layers also provide mechanical support for the thin tissue lamellae. A standard FIB lift out procedure was used to produce TEM specimens from the iron deposits. The FIB was operated at 30 kV and a current of 2.5 nA for initial milling, and then reduced to a current of 0.8 nA to produce a more planar surface. A 5 keV and 68 pA ion beam was used for final thining to remove any damaged surface material (produced by high energy gallium ions in previous steps) and to reduce the thickness to 100–200 nm. The final lamellae were somewhat thick by TEM standards in order to be mechanically stable, but worked well for our purposes as the materials are mainly comprised of light-weight carbonaceous matter. Moreover thicker samples increase the interaction volume of the low concentration iron deposits, which improves the spectral signal to noise ratios.

2.7. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS)

Specimens were analyzed using a non-probe-corrected, monochromated 300 kV electron beam in a FEI Titan (Thermo Fisher, Hillsboro, OR) environmental TEM operated in STEM mode at a spot size of 11 with a C2 aperture of 150 μm and a C3 aperture of 50 μm, resulting in a focused beam, convergence semi-angle of 8.4 mrad and an estimated beam size of 0.5 nm in diameter. A Gatan image filter (GIF) Quantum (Gatan Inc., USA) was used to collect the electron energy loss signals with an entrance aperture of 2.5 mm, a collection angle of 18.3 mrad, and an energy dispersion of 0.025 eV/channel. The average energy resolution was around 0.2 eV measuring the full width half maxima (FWHM) of the zero loss peak (ZLP). Dual EELS, which takes a high and a low loss spectrum in an alternating fashion, was used for recording EELS spectrum images. The core loss spectra were acquired in an energy range of 690–740 eV, containing the iron L23 edge, while the low loss spectrum contains the ZLP, which is used for deconvolution and alignment along the energy axis. The EELS spectrum images were collected at a step size (also known as pixel size or pitch distance) of 15–150 nm and a dwell time of 5 s per pixel for each specimen, resulting in an average acquisition time of 30 mins. The spectrum image could be collected at a much finer step size at a cost of longer acquisition time and higher total dose, but would not provide much additional information as the iron deposits are quite large by TEM standards. The beam current and dose rate during acquisition are estimated to be 2 pA and 107 e−/nm2/s, respectively. The total dose on each specimen during acquisition was at the same level as previously reported values [40]. Although it is possible for an electron beam to reduce the valence state of transition metal ions at large doses [44], we did not detect beam induced damage after acquisition (e.g. contrast and morphology remain the same) owing to a small probe and a large step size allowing proper heat dissipation [44]. Additionally, we acquired time series EELS spectra for Fe L-edge on several iron deposits and did not observe apparent spectral feature changes (one example is shown in Supplementary Figure S1).

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Correlative MRI, OM and SEM

Owing to the drastically different contrast mechanisms between MRI and OM, the purple boxed region in the inset of MRI image (Figure 1a) is manually approximated to be the blue boxed region in the inset of OM image (Figure 1b) by estimating the distance from tissue edges. On the other hand, the SEM micrograph (Figure 1c) can be more precisely correlated with the OM image (Figure 1b) through some distinct surface features, e.g., a blood vessel (Figure 1b yellow box) is used as an alignment feature. A dark spot (Figure 1b top-right inset), which indicates the potential presence of ferritin [43], happens to be located at the tail of the blood vessel, as delineated by the green box (Figure 1c). The corresponding EDS spectrum (Figure 1d) at the red marked location in the inset confirms the existence of iron deposits. However, iron signals cannot easily be found at every dark spot in histology OM because not all ferritin contains large quantities of iron [45], and some ferritin proteins may not have bound iron at the surface of the tissue. Besides, some iron deposits could be located underneath the sample surface where the electron beam cannot reach. The contrast from back-scattered electrons as used by Kempen et al. [7], which is largely dependent on atomic weight information, would be a convenient way to locate heavier elements, e.g. iron, but is not applicable in this study because the low iron concentration in the deposits yields a low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Instead, EDS spectra and SEM-EDS maps are used to determine the exact location of Fe deposits across specimens (Figure 1d &amp; 2). The size of these deposits revealed using SEM-EDS is measured to be 5–10 μm across.

3.2. FIB

Conventional biological sample preparation using an ultramicrotome would produce uniformly thin specimens from bulk tissues for TEM analysis, but that method is inefficient and not reproducible as these iron deposits are rare events even in pathological brain tissues. Therefore, the site-specific extraction strategy using FIB is needed to bridge the large field-of-view OM and high resolution TEM and to locate areas of interest for the latter. After locating exactly an iron deposit, FIB is used to extract a cross section from the center of the deposit for STEM-EELS analysis (Figure 3). In particular, thinning the FIB lamellae requires more care than for conventional inorganic materials (e.g. Si). The bottom of the lamella started to be damaged while the top was still around 200 nm thick (Figure 3d).

3.3. STEM-EELS Data

STEM-EELS provides ”3D” datasets, commonly referred to as spectrum images, with each pixel linked to an EEL spectrum collected at the corresponding electron beam spot position. Seven iron deposits from three different AD patients and an iron deposit from healthy brain tissue as the negative control were examined using monochromated STEM-EELS in order to establish their Fe valence state, as well as a spectrum for an Fe3O4 and an Fe2O3 standard power specimen (Supplementary Figures S3 &amp; S4). The EEL spectra of AD specimens (Figure 4a left column) and control specimens (Figure 5 left column) showing the Fe L3 edge at 710 eV and L2 edge at 721 eV [39] are summed from the marked iron rich regions delineated in the EELS map and annular dark field (ADF) STEM images (Figure 4a middle and right columns, respectively). The EELS maps are generated by assigning the maximum peak intensity of the Fe L3 peak to the corresponding pixel. Additionally, iron deposits exhibit brighter contrast in the ADF-STEM images because they are atomically heavier than the surrounding carbonaceous matrix. The size of these iron deposits is approximately 1–2 μm across, which is smaller than the measurements of 5–10 μm performed in SEM-EDS. However, 2–3 iron rich regions are observed in each TEM specimen (Figure 4a middle column), suggesting that iron deposits tend to form clusters in AD brain tissues. The EEL spectra of negative control specimens (Figure 5) are noisy under similar microscope conditions because of the smaller iron rich regions (approximately 100–200 nm across), as expected for healthy patients.

In order to study the valence state of the iron deposits, the energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) of Fe L23 edge for each specimen is shown in Figure 4. The L3 absorption edge has a strong main peak at 710 eV and a pre-peak at 708.2 eV for Fe3+ ions. On the other hand, Fe2+ has a stronger peak at lower energy (708.2 eV) and a weaker peak at 710 eV [39, 46]. Reference EEL spectra of ferric and ferrous iron are reproduced from Brown et al. [46] in Supplementary Figure S6. The intensity ratios of the two maxima (pre-peak and main peak) of the Fe L3 edge are dependent on ferric and ferrous iron concentration in a mixed valence iron compound. The overlay of normalized EEL spectra (Figure 4b) shows that the pre-peaks from AD brain tissues (Figure 4a) have stronger intensity than that from the negative control specimen in

Figure 5 and the Fe2O3 standard specimen (all Fe3+) in Supplementary Figure S4, suggesting that iron deposits in AD brains contain higher concentration of ferrous ions. The same level of pre-peak intensity between the negative control specimen and the standard specimen also suggests that iron deposits in healthy brains are mainly comprised of ferric iron. The EELS maps taken at 708 and 710 eV (Supplementary Figure S7) showing intensities in the same regions of deposits, and not separately, suggesting that ferric and ferrous ions are uniformly distributed in iron deposits. However, the pre-peak intensity is also influenced by the coordination (e.g. tetrahedral vs. octahedral) of iron ions in minerals [39], making it difficult to quantitatively determine the ferrous iron concentration without the prior knowledge of iron deposit crystal structures, which were not determined here.

Another well-recognized approach to determine the mixed valence state of 3d transition metals in general is based on the intensity ratios of L3 to L2 absorption edges [44]. These ratios can be compared with known standards (e.g. iron oxides and hydroxides) to identify relative valence states. This approach, developed by van Aken et al. [39] for iron minerals, is coordination insensitive and applicable for most iron oxides [44]. As iron is normally stored in the form of hydrated iron oxides in ferritins [31], and co-existence of O K and Fe L edges is shown in Figure 5a, it is appropriate to use van Aken’s method to quantitatively estimate the proportions of oxidation state of iron deposits from AD brain tissue (details in Supplementary). The Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 standard specimens were analyzed using this method and a good agreement between the estimation and the known composition was established with an absolute error less than 0.02 (Supplementary Figure S3 &amp; S4). The ferrous ion concentrations (Fe2+/ΣFe) for each iron deposits are given in Figure 4a (left column). The average portion of ferrous state is 0.33 ± 0.1 of the whole iron composition in these deposits from AD patients.

4. Discussion and Conclusions

In this study, a number of correlative imaging techniques was applied to determine the valence state of iron deposits in AD patients. MRI was first used to qualitatively map regions (approximately 2 × 2 mm) of high iron composition in human hippocampal specimens to enable higher-resolution EM analysis. The iron location was then reduced to a 100 μm2 area using OM and further to a 10 μm2 region using SEM, and finally confirmed with EDS. Thin cross-section of iron deposits were then extracted using FIB to make electron transparent samples. The relative concentrations of ferric and ferrous ions within the iron deposits were determined by studying the intensity ratios of Fe L3 : L2 edges from the ELNES of the Fe L23 edge using monochromated STEM-EELS. Iron deposits found in AD brain tissues are 1–2 μm across in size and tend to form in 5–10 μm clusters. The ferrous iron (Fe2+) composition is in the range from 0.22–0.50 of the whole iron content for the deposits investigated in this study.

Our observations provide supportive evidence of ferrous iron as being associated with AD, which are in agreement with the results of previous studies [34, 35]. Although ferrous ions are found in all of the AD brain tissue specimens, the role of Fe2+ ion species in the pathogenesis of AD remains uncertain. Future studies can aim to further investigate better the temporospatial progression of iron deposition in AD using robust control samples and samples across progressive stages of the disease.

The correlative characterization approach presented here utilizing MRI, OM, and several phys-EM techniques that are not usually applied in the medical sciences, such as SEM-EDS and STEM-EELS, is highly versatile, and can be modified to investigate chemical composition and valence state of naturally occurring nanoparticles and deposits in bulk tissue and other biological samples. It is essential to preserve the original chemical state and information of the sample throughout the process as done here. For example, the histology stains should not introduce additional ions of interest or chemically react with the mineral deposits to alter their valence states.

As a possibility for future work, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) from a synchrotron can be used to directly map iron deposits from bulk specimens [47]. The XAS maps can also be co-registered with SEM-EDS maps to assist in the fabrication of STEM-EELS specimens using FIB for higher spatial resolution. Should higher resolution imaging and energy spectra be thought important, probe corrected STEM and superior monochromatic resolution would allow more detailed examination of the deposits and achieve detection at lower concentrations and smaller particle size. EM at cryogenic temperatures could also significantly reduce the ionization damage (radiolysis) [48] of biological tissue and has been widely used in structural biology [49] and recently in materials research [50]. Ultimately, direct discovery of mineral deposits using cryo-SEM-EDS, site-specific extraction using cryo-FIB, and quantitative analysis using cryo-STEM-EELS while keeping the sample in a frozen state throughout the characterization process would best preserve the pristine nature of the samples and avoid inadvertent distortion during fixation, dehydration, embedding and other sample preparation procedures.

Thus while utilizing standard STEM-EELS analysis, we advance understanding of possible causes of AD in human patients by a combination of correlative imaging and site-specific specimen preparation techniques. These commonly used methods in physical science have great potential in medical discovery. Taking advantage of such procedures would provide unique insight into biomedical problems.

Figure 4: STEM-EELS dataset acquired from three different AD brain tissue samples. (a) Background subtracted EEL spectra of seven deposits integrated from the boxed regions on the right showing iron L23 absorption edges. The Fe L3 maximum (at 710 eV ) is approximately 11 eV lower than the L2 edge maximum (at 721 eV ). The L3 edge also exhibits a pre-peak at 708.2 eV. The intensity ratios of the Fe L3 to L2 edge are dependent on ferric and ferrous iron concentration in a mixed valence iron compound. The ferrous iron concentration, Fe2+/ΣFe, is calculated [39] and shown in the EEL spectra. EELS maps (middle column) are generated from EEL spectra intensity at 710 eV with an integration window of 0.05 eV delineating the iron deposits. 2–3 deposits of 1–2 μm across in size are present is each lamella. The corresponding ADF-STEM images (right column) also show the locations of the iron deposits with brighter contrast due to the relatively heavier atomic weight compared to their surroundings. (b) An EEL spectra overlay of AD specimens in (a), the negative control specimen in Figure 5 and the Fe2O3 standard specimen (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) in Supplementary Figure S4. The spectra are scaled (normalized) to the same maximum intensity of the Fe L3 edge. The inset is a magnified view of the Fe L3 edge pre-peak at 708.2 eV, marked by the dashed square box. All spectra from AD brain tissues exhibit stronger pre-peaks than that from the negative control specimen and the Fe2O3 standard specimen, suggesting higher concentration of ferrous ions in AD brain specimens. The pre-peak intensity of the negative control specimen is at the same level as the Fe2O3 standard specimen, suggesting that iron deposits in healthy brains are mainly comprised of ferric iron. The different pre-peak intensities in AD brain tissues also suggest variations of ferrous/ferric iron concentrations of different AD patients and deposits.

Figure 5: (a) O K edge and (b) Fe L edge EEL spectra of healthy brain tissues (negative control) integrated from the boxed region on (c) the EELS map, suggesting that iron is stored in an iron oxide form in the deposit. The intensity of Fe L3 edge pre-peak (708.2 eV) is weaker compared with AD specimens in Figure 4, suggesting that the concentration of ferric ions is higher in healthy brains. Overall, iron deposits are found to be rare and small in healthy brain tissues (100–200 nm across). The whole mapped regions are marked as red boxes in (d) the ADF-STEM image.
