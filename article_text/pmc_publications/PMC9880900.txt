Background:

We examined the association between asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis (aICAS) and cortical thickness using brain magnetic resonance morphometry in two cohorts.

Methods:

This cross-sectional study included stroke-free participants from the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). We represented the predictor aICAS in NOMAS as a continuous global stenosis score reflecting an overall burden of stenosis (possible range 0–44) assessed by magnetic resonance angiography and in NACC as a dichotomous autopsy-determined Circle of Willis (CoW) atherosclerosis (none-mild vs moderate-severe). The primary outcome of interest was total cortical thickness. We analyzed each dataset separately using multivariable linear regression.

Results:

The analysis included 1209 NOMAS (46% had any stenosis, 5% had ≥70% stenosis of at least one vessel; stenosis score range 0–11) and 392 NACC (36% moderate-severe CoW atherosclerosis) participants. We found an inverse relationship between stenosis score and total cortical thickness (β-estimate [95% confidence interval (CI)]: −2.98 [−5.85, −0.11]) in adjusted models. We replicated these results in NACC (β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.06 [−0.11, −0.003]). Post-hoc, we segregated stenosis scores by location and only posterior circulation stenosis score was associated with total cortical thickness (anterior β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.90 [−5.16, 3.36], posterior β-estimate [95% CI]: −7.25 [−14.30, −0.20]).

Conclusion:

We found both radiographically and neuropathologically determined aICAS to be associated with global cortical thinning. Interestingly, posterior circulation stenoses appeared to drive this association with global cortical thinning, raising the possibility of pathophysiologic mechanisms for cortical thinning other than impaired hemodynamics.

pmcIntroduction:

Asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis (aICAS) is common among community-dwelling stroke-free adults and confers risk for future vascular events, but is also increasingly implicated in cognitive impairment [1,2]. Investigators have reported an association between aICAS and dementia risk among white participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Community (ARIC) study and progression of mild cognitive impairment to dementia in a Chinese population [3,4]. Various neuropathologic studies have demonstrated a relationship between Circle of Willis (CoW) atherosclerosis and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology [5,6].

Neuroimaging biomarkers have not been well utilized in examining the possible role of aICAS in structural brain changes that relate to cognitive decline. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry is a semi-automated quantification of brain structure volumes that may be helpful in detecting early in-vivo structural changes related to cerebrovascular ischemia or neurodegeneration [7]. Therefore, we sought to study the relationship between aICAS and cerebral gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, and cortical thickness by leveraging two longitudinal cohorts, the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS) and National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), that include imaging and neuropathologic assessments of aICAS, respectively. Given possible histopathological differences of stenoses by vascular territory [8], we additionally considered the relationship of stenoses segregated by anterior or posterior circulation with morphometry measures of interest. In this cross-sectional analysis, we hypothesized increasing aICAS severity would be associated with reduced GM and WM volumes, and cortical thickness, but increased WMH volumes among those free of clinical stroke or neuropathologic evidence of infarct.

Methods:

Study Populations:

This cross-sectional analysis included participants from the NOMAS MRI substudy and NACC. NOMAS is a prospective, population-based study of stroke risk factors in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort based in northern Manhattan. Methods of participant recruitment and evaluation have been previously described [9]. A total of 3,298 stroke-free participants were recruited from 1993–2001. In 2003–2008, standardized brain MRI protocols were introduced in NOMAS and 1091 surviving stroke-free participants aged 50 years or older and 199 household members were invited to participate and screened for eligibility in the MRI substudy, for a total of 1290 participants. In this study, we included 1209 participants who had ICAS assessments and MRI morphometry (Figure).

NACC is a collaborative database that maintains standardized clinical, radiographic, and neuropathologic data on AD and AD-related dementia. Trained personnel at Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) throughout the United States enroll participants ranging from cognitively normal to demented. A subset of NACC participants underwent brain MRI with volumetric analysis conducted by the Imaging of Dementia and Aging (IDeA) Lab (Director: Charles DeCarli, MD; University of California, Davis; http://idealab.ucdavis.edu/), following Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) protocols [10]. Another subset of participants consented to brain donation upon death and underwent autopsy to comprise the neuropathology dataset [11]. At the time of our data request, there were 44,713 enrolled participants in NACC from September 2005 to November 2021, of whom 6,761 had neuropathology and 7,262 had MRI brain morphometry. A total of 526 participants had neuropathologic assessments with graded severity for CoW atherosclerosis, AD pathologic assessment, and MRI morphometry. We excluded 134 participants who had neuropathologic evidence of large cerebral artery, lacunar, or hemorrhagic infarcts for a remainder of 392 participants included in the present analysis (Figure). If a participant had multiple MRIs, we used the most recent MRI for analysis.

All participants provided written informed consent in their respective studies. Institutional review boards (IRBs) of Columbia University Medical Center and Miami Miller School of Medicine approved NOMAS. The University of Washington Human Subjects Division has determined the NACC database itself is exempt from IRB approval as it does not involve human subjects as defined by state and federal regulations, but all contributing ADRCs are required to maintain their own local IRB approval before participant enrollment and data submission to NACC. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines [12].

Baseline Characteristics

All NOMAS participants underwent a structured questionnaire at time of enrollment. Demographics, education, and leisure-time physical activity were self-reported. Questionnaires for physical activity were correlated with a validated compendium to determine metabolic equivalents (MET) for the intensity and energy expenditure in kilocalories of each activity [13]. We then used a summated MET score, which we calculated from the product of each individual activity’s MET, frequency per week, and duration. Vascular risk factors were recorded at time of MRI study. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia were defined by either self-reported diagnosis, medication use to treat each condition, or blood pressure and/or laboratory evidence of these vascular risks, as previously reported [14]. Participants were also asked duration of their diagnoses, number of medications used, and class of medications used. Smoking was dichotomized as current smoking or not current smoking at time of MRI. Participants were asked their duration of smoking history of packs per day. Blood pressure, serum glucose and lipid profile were recorded at time of MRI assessment.

In NACC, trained personnel from each ADRC collect longitudinal clinical data using a standardized Uniform Data Set. Respondents are the participant and co-participants, who self-report demographics and smoking status. Diagnoses, including vascular risk factors and history of stroke, are made by a team consensus or single physician [15]. We used the clinical evaluation nearest in time to the MRI volumetry, of which all were within 4 years (93% within 1 year).

NOMAS MRI Variables

The NOMAS MRI substudy collected brain MRIs and 3D, time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Following a standardized protocol, this MRI substudy used a 1.5-T MRI system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) at the Columbia University Medical Center [2]. All 11 major intracranial large arteries were visually inspected in the MRA datasets. If arterial stenosis was identified, the narrowest lumen area was measured to define stenosis, referencing the immediately preceding segment with normal lumen (or the next normal appearing lumen if the stenosis was at the arterial origin). Stenoses were categorized as no stenosis, &lt;50% (or luminal irregularities), 50–69%, ≥70%, and flow gap. Stenoses were graded in blinded fashion by a trained neurologist and vascular neurologist independently. Interrater reliability was high (kappa=0.93) for identifying &gt;50% stenosis and the interclass correlation coefficient for the ordinal stenosis scale was &gt;0.90 for single and average measures [2].

To capture an overall stenotic burden, we derived a summated global stenosis score from all inspected intracranial arteries (0 for no stenosis, 1 for &lt;50% stenosis, 2 for 50–69% stenosis, 3 for ≥70% stenosis, 4 for flow gap; total possible range 0–44) [16]. We segregated overall stenosis scores by anterior or posterior circulation stenoses given histopathologic differences of stenoses by vascular territory [8]. Separately, to account for clinically relevant thresholds, we also considered the number of arteries with ≥50% stenosis or ≥70% stenosis.

Other neuroimaging covariates included: any silent brain infarcts (SBI), total small perivascular space (SPVS) score [14], and a brain arterial remodeling (BAR) score [17]. These covariates were included due to their possible association with both atherosclerosis and cognitive impairment [14,17,18]. We defined SBI as a cavitation at least 3 mm in size on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) that is distinct from a vessel due to lack of signal void on T2 sequence and equal intensity to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [18]. SBI included both subcortical and cortical infarcts. Parenchymal hypointensities on 3D axial T1 with a diameter of &lt;3 mm and an absent FLAIR hyperintensity were considered to represent SPVS. Due to a large number of SPVSs in some cases, we used a semiquantitative score to express the degree of brain involvement per section, which we then summated across brain regions for a total SPVS score [14]. For each participant, we derived a global arterial Z-score for BAR from averaged arterial diameters measured by MRA at locations free of stenosis [17].

Morphometry Procedures

In NOMAS, acquired brain MRIs underwent morphometric analysis using the Quantum 6.2 package on Sun Microsystems Ultra 5 workstation at the University of California, Davis and publicly available Freesurfer version 5.1 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) [19]. For total cranial volumes, whole brain voxels from the segmentation of T1-weighted images were summed. For WMH volumes, voxels exhibiting an image intensity ≥3.5 standard deviation above the mean image intensity were summed, then multiplied by pixel dimensions and section thickness [11,19].

For gray/white matter and cortical thickness quantification, images were analyzed using Freesurfer version 5.1. Given image quality requirements, Freesurfer analyses were limited to 946 included NOMAS participants. Most imaging that could not be analyzed with Freesurfer did not meet quality standards on T1 sequences to allow for gray/white matter differentiation. Technical procedures for Freesurfer analyses are previously reported [19,20]. GM volumes includes all GM in the cortices, subcortex, and cerebellum. WM volumes includes all volume within the supratentorial white matter surface, including WMH. Cortical thickness is calculated as the closest distance from the gray/white matter boundary to the gray/CSF boundary at each vertex on the tessellated surface [20]. To obtain overall mean cortical thickness, we averaged the mean left and right hemisphere cortical thickness measures. Additionally, we calculated a mean anterior or posterior cortical thickness by structures supplied predominantly by anterior or posterior circulations (Supplemental Table).

In NACC, ADRCs voluntarily submit 1.5 or 3.0-T MRI scans (GE, Siemens, and Phillips) starting in 2005. Imaging data collection and acquisition protocols vary by ADRC. In our included subsample, all MRI studies had T1-weighted images. There were 88 MRI studies without T2 FLAIR sequences and thus no WMH calculations. The IDeA Lab conducted volumetric MRI quantification for NACC based on ADNI protocols, available at https://files.alz.washington.edu/documentation/adni-proto.pdf. We used calculations that only involve the cerebrum, not infratentorial structures or brainstem. We calculated an overall mean cortical thickness by averaging all segmented cortical thickness measurements. Both datasets had volumes recorded as cm3 and cortical thickness recorded as mm.

NACC Neuropathology Evaluation

Trained neuropathologists at each ADRC conducted standardized neuropathologic assessments for NACC by sampling all gross lesions and a minimum of 13 brain regions with hematoxylin and eosin stains, based on reproducible procedures [21]. ICAS is represented through Circle of Willis (CoW) atherosclerosis using a semi-quantitative scale by gross inspection based on overall severity of intimal and medial fibrofatty atheromatous plaques rather than with respect to an individual vessel as none, mild (sparse), moderate, or severe (frequent). AD pathology is further assessed with immunohistochemistry (preferred), Thioflavin S, or sensitive silver histochemical stains to derive an ABC score by ranking amyloid beta plaque score, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD neuritic plaque score [21]. ABC scores range from 0 to 3, with scores 2 (intermediate) and 3 (high) considered as a sufficient explanation for dementia.

Statistical Analysis

We conducted all analyses using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We summarized demographics and covariates using descriptive statistics. We used log-transformed GM, WM, and WMH volumes. We assessed the relationship between ICAS and volumes of interest using linear regression in each dataset separately.

In both NOMAS and NACC datasets, the primary outcome of interest was total cortical thickness. Secondary outcomes were GM, WM, and WMH volumes. In NOMAS, we used ICAS score, treated continuously, as the exposure of interest. We used two regression models: 1) adjusted for age at MRI, sex, race, ethnicity, education, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, MET score, total cranial volume; and 2) adjusted for age at MRI, sex, race, ethnicity, education, MET score, SBP, DBP, glucose, low-density lipoprotein, number of hypertension medications, number of diabetes medications, statin use, smoking packs per day, WMH volume (where appropriate), any SBI, total SPVS score, BAR score, total cranial volume. Using the most adjusted linear regression model, we further assessed the relationship between volumetric data of interest with the number of arteries with ≥50% stenosis or ≥70% stenosis and ICAS score segregated by anterior or posterior circulation. Post-hoc, we additionally adjusted for presence or absence of fetal posterior cerebral artery in the regression model when testing posterior circulation only ICAS score to better understand possible underlying mechanisms, which may include impaired cerebral hemodynamics.

In NACC, we used neuropathologically assessed CoW atherosclerosis, represented dichotomously (none/mild vs moderate/severe), as the exposure. We performed linear regression adjusting for age at MRI, years from MRI to death, sex, race, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, WMH volume (where appropriate), ABC score, total cranial volume.

Results:

Among 1209 included NOMAS participants (cortical thickness available in n=946), the mean age was 71±9 years at MRI, 41% were male, and 65% Hispanic. About 46% had any stenosis (stenosis score range 0 to 11), and 5% had ≥70% stenosis. From NACC, we included 392 patients (average age at MRI: 76±10 years, average age at autopsy: 81±11 years, 56% male, 89% non-Hispanic white) of whom 36% had moderate-severe CoW atherosclerosis at autopsy. Table 1 displays study population characteristics.

Table 2 shows the linear regression models used to examine the relationship between measures of aICAS and imaging characteristics of interest. In fully adjusted models, we found a significant association between stenosis score and total cortical thickness (adjusted β-estimate [95% confidence interval (CI)]: −2.98 mm per unit increase in stenosis score [−5.85, −0.11]). We also found a significant positive association between stenosis score and log-transformed WMH volume (adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: 0.03 [0.01, 0.05]). There were no significant relationships between stenosis score and log-transformed GM (adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.89 [−2.22, 0.44] or white matter volumes (adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.83 [−2.79, 1.13]). We replicated these findings in NACC using an adjusted linear regression model (total cortical thickness adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.06 mm in moderate-severe CoW atherosclerosis when compared to none-mild [−0.11, −0.003]; log WMH volume adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: 0.35 [0.08, 0.63]).

Lastly, in NOMAS, we evaluated the relationship between morphometrics and stenosis score segregated by degree of stenosis or vascular territory, shown in Table 3 and 4, respectively. Similarly, we found an inverse association between number of arteries with ≥50% or ≥70% stenosis and total cortical thickness (≥50% stenosis adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −20.24 [−36.96, −3.52]; ≥70% stenosis adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −31.61 [−57.43, −5.79]). When segregating stenosis by vascular territory, only posterior circulation stenosis score was negatively associated with total cortical thickness (posterior adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −7.25 [−14.30, −0.20]; anterior adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.90 [−5.16, 3.36]). This association between posterior circulation stenosis score and total cortical thickness persisted after including presence or stenosis of fetal PCA in the regression model (adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −6.28 [−13.62, −1.05]). Moreover, we found an association between posterior circulation stenoses and anterior but not posterior cortical thickness (anterior adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.010 [−0.014, −0.002]; posterior adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.004 [−0.073, 0.003]). The relationship between posterior circulation stenoses and anterior cortical thickness became attenuated when additionally adjusted for presence or stenosis of fetal PCA (adjusted β-estimate [95% CI]: −0.008 [−0.016, 0.001]).

Discussion:

In two longitudinal cohorts, our main finding is that intracranial arterial stenosis among either stroke-free (NOMAS) or infarct-free (NACC) individuals is associated with cortical thinning. We demonstrated this association using both radiographically and neuropathologically determined global burden of aICAS, independent of demographics, vascular risk factors, and potential neuroimaging and neuropathologic confounders. Interestingly, posterior circulation stenoses appeared to drive this association with global cortical thinning, implicating mechanisms for structural changes other than impaired hemodynamics.

Cortical thinning can be an important biomarker for cognitive decline as it has been linked to AD and vascular dementia in prodromal cognitive stages [22–24]. Prior studies have shown both cerebral small vessel disease and asymptomatic extracranial carotid disease to be associated with cortical thinning [24,25]. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying cortical thinning may differ by disease entity. AD pathology can directly lead to GM atrophy, while cerebral small vessel disease may interrupt white matter tracts causing secondary loss of cortex, and extracranial carotid disease may operate through altered hemodynamics [24,26,27]. It is also likely AD and cerebrovascular pathologies interact to promote cortical atrophy given pathologic evidence demonstrating a high prevalence of coexistence and a correlation between atherosclerosis to AD pathology [6,7].

In the case of aICAS, prior studies have suggested a variety of possible pathways towards cortical atrophy and cognitive decline, which may include cerebral hypoperfusion [28], atherothrombotic embolization and microinfarcts [29], and hypoxia [30]. In our analysis, the association between aICAS and cortical thinning was independent of vascular risk factors and other neuroimaging biomarkers, suggesting a relationship intrinsic to large artery stenosis burden. On a phenotypic level, this is consistent with a report from ARIC in which aICAS was related to dementia after adjustment for vascular risk factors and WMH volume [3]. In NACC, we included AD pathology in the regression model, further supporting evidence of a more direct relationship between aICAS and cortical thinning rather than aICAS as a bystander to AD pathology.

Interestingly, we found a stronger association between posterior circulation stenoses and global cortical thickness than with anterior circulation stenoses. Further, the inverse association between posterior circulation stenoses and cortical thickness seemed to represent mostly differences in anterior cortical thicknesses, not in the cortical structures more directly supplied by the posterior circulation. The overall persistence of these associations after adjustment for presence or stenosis of a fetal posterior cerebral artery would suggest a role of posterior circulation stenosis in cortical structural changes partly outside of altered cerebral hemodynamics. In autopsied specimens from the BAR study, posterior circulation stenosis differed from anterior circulation vessels histopathologically in degree of wall thickness, elastin loss, and concentric intimal thickness, which may suggest a susceptibility to advanced non-atherosclerotic arterial aging [16]. In the same cohort, posterior brain arterial aging was linked to increased amyloid deposition [31]. Theoretically, the stronger association we found between higher degree stenosis (≥50% or ≥70%) and cortical changes could be due to greater cerebral hemodynamic disturbance from significant stenoses as others have considered [32], but the posterior circulation findings in our study are inconsistent with this being a predominant pathophysiologic pathway. Rather than hemodynamic effects, the degree of stenosis may reflect more advanced arterial aging and associated cerebral changes. Speculatively, shared changes in the anterior circulation arterioles may also explain the anterior circulation cortical thinning and white matter hyperintensity findings. There may be implications in arterial remodeling, endothelial injury and inflammation, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction that is beyond the scope our study [33]. Alternatively, there could be other unaccounted factors such as reduced connectivity with posterior fossa structures or anastomotic arterial diameter that may mediate a hemodynamic relationship between posterior circulation stenoses and cortical thinning [34,35].

Lastly in our analysis, the relationship between aICAS and WMH volumes may be due to concomitant cerebral small vessel disease, which shares risk factors with aICAS and are often clinically related [36,37]. In the literature, the evidence on a direct connection between ICAS and WMH is mixed [38], but if aICAS and cerebral small vessel disease are often comingled, there may be a converged pathway to cortical atrophy represented in WMH volume. In NOMAS, WMH in cholinergic tracts were previously shown to be associated with cortical thinning in AD-vulnerable regions [19]. We did not find a consistent association between aICAS and GM and WM volumes. However, morphometric analysis of cortical thickness may be more sensitive to structural changes than volume analysis [39]. Volumes may also be more susceptible to variation in individual head size causing residual confounding despite correction for total intracranial volumes in our regression models. Therefore, asymptomatic ICAS, a subclinical entity, may be associated with more subtle neurodegenerative changes.

Strengths of our study include the use of two distinct cohorts, one with a radiographic and the other with neuropathologic assessments of global burden of aICAS. Further, our findings remained statistically significant after adjustment for a host of potential confounders based on theory and prior evidence, though the possibility of unaccounted confounding remains. Weaknesses of this study include the cross-sectional design which limits causative conclusions and temporal assessment of morphometry. There are also weaknesses specific to each cohort, which we attempted to mitigate with strengths of the other cohort. For NOMAS, we did not have pathologic data, which in the case of AD pathology could be a strong underlying component of cortical thinning; however, by leveraging the neuropathologic information in NACC, we replicated the association between CoW atherosclerosis and cortical thickness in NACC after accounting for AD pathology. Exclusion of infarcts in the NACC dataset may limit generalizability. Additionally, the NACC neuropathology cohort is composed of predominantly non-Hispanic white and well-educated participants, but this potential selection bias is mitigated by the large, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and socioeconomically diverse NOMAS cohort.

In summary, we demonstrated an association between intracranial artery stenosis and cortical thinning amongst stroke- or infarct-free individuals from two longitudinal cohorts. Our results may suggest covert deleterious effects of intracranial artery disease that would need confirmation in prospective biomarker validation studies. The mechanisms for cortical thinning in those with aICAS may be diverse and dependent on location and stenosis pathology. Further study is needed using more detailed aICAS assessments and topography of morphometric changes. Modalities like transcranial Doppler and high-definition MRI with vessel wall imaging may also shed light on potential pathophysiologic mechanisms.

Asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis is associated with cortical thinning

This relationship was independent of vascular risk factors and Alzheimer disease

Posterior circulation stenoses drove the finding, implying non-hemodynamic causes
