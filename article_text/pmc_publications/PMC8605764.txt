Vesicular acetylcholine transporter plays a crucial role in the cholinergic system, and its alterations is implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders. We recently developed a PET imaging tracer [18F]VAT to target VAChT in vivo with high affinity and selectivity. Here we report in vitro characterization of [3H]VAT, a tritiated counterpart of [18F]VAT. Using human VAChT-rich cell membrane extracts, a saturated binding curve was obtained for [3H]VAT with Kd = 6.5 nM and Bmax = 22.89 pmol/mg protein. In the [3H]VAT competition-binding assay with a panel of CNS ligands, binding inhibition of [3H]VAT was observed using VAChT ligands, the Ki values ranged from 5.41 to 33.3 nM. No inhibition was detected using a panel of other CNS ligands. In vitro [3H]VAT autoradiography of rat brain sections showed strong signals in the striatum, moderate to high signals in vermis, thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus, and weak signals in cerebellum. Strong [3H]VAT ARG signals were also observed from striatal sections of normal nonhuman primates and human brains. Competitive ARG study with human striatal sections demonstrated strong ARG signals of [3H]VAT in caudate and putamen were blocked significantly by either VAChT ligand TZ659 or (−)-vesamicol, but not by the σ1 receptor ligand Yun-122. ARG study also indicated that signal in the striatal sections from PSP human brains was lower than normal human brains. These data provide solid evidence supporting [18F]VAT as a suitable PET radiotracer for quantitative assessment of VAChT levels in vivo.

pmc1. Introduction

Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), predominantly found in pre-synaptic terminal vesicles, plays a crucial role in the cholinergic system (Arvidsson et al., 1997). VAChT is responsible for loading newly synthesized acetylcholine (ACh) from the cytoplasm into pre-synaptic vesicles and regulates ACh release. Alteration in VAChT expression is implicated in clinically important features of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Armstrong, 2013; Davies and Maloney, 1976; Hilker et al., 2005; Prado et al., 2013; Schliebs and Arendt, 2006, 2011). PSP is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement abnormalities. Striatal cholinergic deficits with decreased VAChT expression and down-regulated choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities were found in PSP (Javoy-Agid, 1994; Ruberg et al., 1985; Suzuki et al., 2002). As a reliable biomarker of various neurodegenerative diseases with cholinergic dysfunction (Bohnen et al., 2003, 2009), the changes of VAChT expression level that measured by PET imaging combined with suitable radiotracer may reveal cholinergic deficits. This may also advance our understanding some key aspects of underlying pathology in neurodegenerative disorders (Bohnen et al., 2018; Ferreira-Vieira et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2002).

Molecular imaging using PET modality offers a non-invasive methodology to assess a wide range of physiologic and pathologic conditions. In the past decade, several (−)-vesamicol analogs have been developed as potential VAChT PET imaging agents (Bohnen et al., 2018; Giboureau et al., 2010; Kilbourn et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013; Petrou et al., 2014). Nevertheless, further translation study reveals that most of these are not suitable for clinical use due to their inappropriate kinetic profiles, low permeability of brain blood barrier, fast metabolism, or lack of selectivity for VAChT with off target binding to sigma receptors (Giboureau et al., 2010). Recently, radiotracer [18F]FEOBV was reported as the first PET radiopharmaceutical for mapping VAChT in human brains despite slow brain kinetics (Giboureau et al., 2007; Kilbourn et al., 2009; Petrou et al., 2014). We also reported [18F]VAT as a promising PET tracer for imaging VAChT. with favorable brain pharmacokinetics (Jin et al., 2016, 2018; Liu et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2015). Currently, [18F]VAT is undergoing patient-oriented clinical investigation in subjects with neurological disorders. Nevertheless, due to the short half-life (110 min) of radioisotope F-18, performing in vitro pharmacokinetic studies for determination of F-18 labeled radiotracer’s parameters is challenging. Therefore, we turned to use custom synthesized radioligand, [3H]VAT that shares the same chemical structure of [18F]VAT, but labeling with different isotope (Fig. 1). Tritium (H-3) with long half-life (12.43 years) possesses advantages including low cost, ease and safe handling and disposal. Also, one batch of 3H-radiotracer production is sufficient to accomplish multiple property experiments. This will circumvent the on-site synthesis limitation of short half-life radioligand [18F]VAT, and reduce the data variability caused by different batches of [18F]VAT production. Consequently, in this manuscript we report our in vitro characterization of [3H]VAT and the pharmacological parameters’ determinations of VAT toward VAChT.

2. Material and methods

2.1. [3H]VAT

The tritiated radioligand [3H]VAT was custom synthesized by NOVANDI Chemistry AB (Södertalje, Sweden) with chemical precursor from our laboratory. [3H]VAT and [18F]VAT (Fig. 1) share the same chemical structure, but are labeled with different isotopes (Tu et al., 2015). It is a (−)-vesamicol derivative generated by interposing a carbonyl group between the phenyl and piperidyl groups of the benzovesamicol structure (Jin et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2015).

2.2. Cell culture

The protein kinase A-deficient PC12 cell line PC12A123.7 lacks both choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). PC12A123.7 cells stably transfected with human VAChT were obtained from GenBank (GeneBank: AAA20497.1). PC12A123.7 cells transfected with the blank parent vector served as the background control for the binding assays. Cell lines were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units penicillin/mL, 100 μg streptomycin/mL, and 10 μg blasticidin/mL.

2.3. Rat, and nonhuman primate brain tissues

Rat brain tissue was collected post-mortem and immediately snap-frozen. Mature male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (Charles River Laboratories, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were euthanized by exsanguination under surgical plane isoflurane/oxygen anesthesia. All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals under a protocol approved by Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (20180188). Nonhuman primate brain tissue from a male cynomolgus macaque (NCBI_Taxon:9541, age: 7 years, weight: 8.0 kg) was obtained from previously banked samples. Human brain tissue from PSP cases were obtained from the Movement Disorders Research Brain Bank at Washington University School of Medicine. The donor of PSP brain #16573 was clinically diagnosed with stage 4 Parkinsonism with dementia, motor dysfunction score of 46, and Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE) of 26. The donor of PSP brain #21481 had stage 4 Parkinsonism with dementia, motor dysfunction score of 44, and MMSE of 21. The donor of PSP brain #5492 had stage 5 Parkinsonism with dementia, motor dysfunction score of 60, and MMSE of 30. The donor of PSP brain #3542 had stage 5 Parkinsonism with dementia, motor dysfunction score of 44, and MMSE of 22. Control brain tissue from neurologically normal donors were obtained by the Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University.

2.4. Preparation of post-nuclear supernatant

Post-nuclear supernatant from transfected cells was prepared using a method previously described (Liu et al., 2015). Briefly, confluent cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice using Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4). Cells were then suspended in cold homogenization buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 4 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), and gently homogenized using glass Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris. The supernatant collected after careful decanting was then centrifuged at 14000×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The final pellet was suspended in the assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and was stored at −80 °C until further use. The protein concentration was finally determined using the Detergent Compatible (DC) protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.5. Radioligand saturation binding

[3H]VAT was used as the radioligand for saturation binding assay. The assay volume included 150 μL of buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 100 μM EDTA at pH 7.4) in each well of 96-well polypropylene plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) with radiotracer concentrations that ranged from 0.68 to 25 nM, and 5 μg protein of post-nuclear supernatants. The mixture was incubated for 120 min at 25 °C with continuous shaking. Samples were harvested and filtered rapidly using a 96-well glass fiber filtration plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA) presoaked with 100 μL assay buffer for 1 h. Each filter was washed with 3 × 100 μL assay buffer, then transferred to a scintillation vial with 2 mL of scintillation fluid, and counted on a Beta liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS3801). Nonspecific binding was determined from membrane protein extracts of PC12A123.7 cells transfected with the blank parent vector (without VAChT). Counts were normalized to mg protein in the sample. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of one site saturation binding model using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).

2.6. Radioligand competition binding study

The selectivity of radioligand [3H]VAT for VAChT over other CNS receptors including σ1 receptor, dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) was determined by using a competitive binding assay. CNS ligands including the σ1 receptor ligand Yun-122 (N-(4-benzylcyclohexyl)-2-(2-fluorophenyl)acetamide), the phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor, MP-10 (2-[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phe-noxymethyl]-quinoline), D2 receptor ligands (−)-eticlopride and (−)-quinpirole, and VAChT ligands include (−)-vesamicol and VAChT ligands TZ6–59, FBBV, VAT, and TZ45–091B, were used for the competitive binding study of [3H]VAT toward VAChT. Post-nuclear supernatants (5 μg protein) were diluted with the assay buffer and incubated with each test CNS ligand in a total volume of 150 μL with [3H]VAT in 96 well plates at 25 °C for 60 min in shaking condition. The final concentration of the radioligand in each assay was 5 nM. For the test CSN ligands, concentrations ranged from 0.1 nM to 10 μM and were used to determine the inhibition constant (Ki) for each CNS ligand. After incubation, the samples were washed 3 times and the bound radioactivity counted and analyzed by nonlinear regression using one-site competitive binding model with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) in Ki determination. Three independent experiments were performed; the results are reported as mean ± standard deviation.

2.7. In vitro autoradiography study

To check the distribution of [3H]VAT in human and nonhuman primate brain tissues, in vitro autoradiography (ARG) study was performed using sections (12 μm) from frozen brain tissues. Brain sections were brought to room temperature for 30 min, and then pre-incubated with assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA at pH 7.4) for 15 min. Further, slides were incubated with 10 nM of [3H]VAT alone (for total binding), or with the addition of 10 μM of TZ6–59, a potent and selective VAChT ligand as a blocking agent (Liu et al., 2015) for 1 h at room temperature. Then these slides were washed with cold assay buffer for 2 min twice and finally rinsed in cold water. After these slides were dried overnight, they were exposed to X-ray film for 4 weeks before development, and then exposed to phosphor sensor plate for two weeks. Finally, the autoradiography signal was visualized on a Typhoon FLA 7000 scanner (GE), measured and quantified with Multi Gauge program.

2.8. Immunohistochemistry staining study

Immunohistochemistry staining study was conducted on frozen human brain tissue sections (12 μm) adjacent to the section used for in vitro autoradiography studies. In brief, frozen striatal sections were warmed at room temperature for 15 min, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 × PBS for 15 min. Tissue sections were washed in PBS and incubated in Antigen Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min in a boiling water bath, and then blocked with 5% horse serum for 2 h at room temperature, followed by blocking using Ready Probes Endogenous HRP and AP Blocking Solution (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-VAChT antibody (Novus, Littleton, CO) overnight at 4 °C. After that, sections were washed and incubated with ImmPRESS HRP Horse anti-rabbit polymer for 1 h at room temperature, and developed with ImmPACT DAB (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). VAChT IHC signal was visualized by scanning in the NanoZoomer system (Hamamatsu, Japan).

3. Results

3.1. Saturation binding of [3H]VAT

Membrane protein extracts of post-nuclear supernatant prepared from the human VAChT stably transfected PC12A123.7 cell line were used in the [3H]VAT saturation binding assay. The results are shown in Fig. 2A. The binding activity of [3H]VAT to the VAChT-riched membrane protein (5 μg) extracts increases significantly as [3H]VAT concentrations rose from 0.65 nM to 25 nM (total binding signal). In contrast, in the side-by-side [3H]VAT saturation binding assay with membrane extracts from the host PC12A123.7 cell line, only a slight increase of [3H]VAT binding activity was observed. Taking the [3H]VAT binding activity to the host cell membrane extracts (without human VAChT) as background signal, subtraction of the background signal from the total binding signal of [3H]VAT provides the specific binding level of [3H]VAT to human VAChT. The specific binding data fits a straight line on a Scatchard plot analysis (Fig. 2B), indicating a single binding site for [3H]VAT interacting with human VAChT in the cell membrane. Based on the Scatchard plot fitting model, we calculated the binding affinity of [3H]VAT to human VAChT in the cell membrane with Kd = 6.5 ± 1.7 nM and Bmax = 22.89 ± 1.93 pmol/mg protein (n = 3).

3.2. The binding selectivity of [3H]VAT toward VAChT

In order to determine the selectivity of [3H]VAT binding to VAChT, a panel of CNS ligands including ligands to σ1 receptor, PDE10A, and D2 receptor were used in the competitive binding assay. The σ1 receptor is a transmembrane protein found in many different tissue types, and which is highly expressed in certain regions of the central nervous system; Yun-122 is a potent and selective σ1 ligand. PDE10A is an enzyme highly expressed in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and substantia nigra; MP-10 is a PDE10A inhibitor. The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) is a postsynaptic receptor, which is highly concentrated in the striatum, and plays an important role in dopaminergic neurotransmission and in the circuitry intimately involved in motor control,; (−)-eticlopride is a D2 antagonist, while (−)-quinpirole is a D2 agonist. The [3H]VAT competition binding assay was performed with cold ligands at concentrations ranged from 0.1 nM to 10 μM. Binding inhibition of [3H]VAT was observed only using VAChT ligands (TZ6–59, TZ45–091B, and VAT) (Efange et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Tu et al., 2009, 2012, 2015) and (−)-vesamicol, a ligand that is potent for both VAChT and σ1 receptor (Anderson et al., 1983; Carroll, 1985; Coffeen et al., 1996; Efange, 2000; Efange et al., 1995a,b; Prior et al., 1992) (Fig. 3). Essentially no binding inhibition was detected using other CNS ligands including PDE10A ligand MP-10; σ1 receptor ligand Yun-122, and D2 receptor ligands (−)-eticlopride and (−)-quinpirole (Eilam and Szechtman, 1989; Huang et al., 1998; Köhler et al., 1985; Luedtke et al., 2012; Verhoest et al., 2009). This indicates high selectivity of [3H]VAT binding to VAChT. The results of the competitive binding assay are summarized in Table 1. Importantly, VAT shows strong binding affinity to VAChT with Ki value of 6.98 nM, higher than either VAChT inhibitor FBBV (Ki = 24.7 nM) or (−)-vesamicol (Ki = 33.3 nM). Other two VAChT ligands from our laboratory, TZ45–091B and TZ6–59, also have strong binding affinity with Ki value of 6.0 nM and 5.41 nM respectively.

3.3. Characterizations of [3H]VAT binding towards VAChT in rat, nonhuman primate, and human postmortem brain tissue sections

Specific binding of [3H]VAT to VAChT was further evaluated in rat, nonhuman primate, and human brain tissues by in vitro autoradiography (Fig. 4). In reference to the anatomic structure of horizontal section of whole rat brain with the hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) histology staining (Fig. 4A), autoradiography studies showed strongest signal in striatum, high signal in the hippocampus, moderate signal in the thalamus and cortex tissues, weak signal in the cerebellum, and essentially no signal in the white matter region. The [3H]VAT ARG radioactivity signal distribution in the rat brain is further confirmed with [3H]VAT ARG in the sagittal section of whole rat brain. In the [3H]VAT ARG of nonhuman primate brain tissue section containing striatum, strong signal in putamen and caudate regions of striatum and high signal in the temporal gyrus are also observed. In the human brain tissues, strong [3H]VAT ARG signal also shows up in the putamen region in the section of striatal tissue, weaker ARG signal in the grey matter region and no ARG signal in the white matter region in section of cerebellum tissue. The ARG signal was able to be blocked significantly in the presence of 10 μM of VAChT-specific ligand TZ6–59 (Supporting Materials Figure S2). The in vitro autoradiography signal of [3H]VAT matches the distribution of VAChT in the brains (Gilmor et al., 1996), and indicates the specificity of [3H]VAT binding toward VAChT in brain tissues.

3.4. Binding characterization of [3H]VAT toward VAChT in human brain striatal regions

The expression of VAChT in the striatal sections of normal human brain tissue was evaluated by VAChT immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (Fig. 5B), in which putamen and caudate region have high IHC staining signal of VAChT. In the competitive [3H]VAT autoradiography with adjacent human striatal sections (Fig. 5A), strong ARG signal lights up on putamen and caudate regions, matching well with the anti VAChT IHC signal in the human striatum sections. The ARG signal was blocked significantly at the presence of 10 μM of VAChT inhibitor either TZ6–59 or (−)-vesamicol, whereas Yun-122 (10 μM, σ1 receptor inhibitor) has negligible blocking effect on the ARG signal (Fig. 5A and C). The results of competitive autoradiography further confirms the binding specificity of [3H]VAT toward VAChT in the human brain.

3.5. Comparison of [3H]VAT binding in the striatal region between PSP and normal human brains

After establishing the in vitro ARG protocol with human brain sections, we performed a direct comparison between progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and normal human striatal sections. The results of [3H]VAT ARG are shown in Fig. 6. High to strong ARG signal was observed in the putamen and caudate regions of striatal sections, and weak ARG signal was detected in the internal capsule region. The presence of 10 μM of TZ6–59, a potent and specific VAChT ligand, showed a significant blocking effect to the ARG signal on the tissue sections. When the ARG signal intensity (PSL/mm2) in the putamen and caudate was measured and quantified, the ARG signal of striatal sections from PSP human brains were statistically lower than that in normal human brains (Fig. 6), suggesting that VAChT protein levels and/or cholinergic neuron terminals in striatum of PSP human brains become deficient. Our in vitro ARG data reported here indicates [3H]VAT can detect differences in VAChT expression levels between PSP and neurologically normal human brains.

4. Discussion

We have previously reported a potent and specific VAChT PET radiotracer [18F]VAT with favorable brain pharmacokinetics for clinical use. The ligand VAT has Ki value is 0.59 nM for VAChT and is selective for VAChT over σ receptors (&gt;1000-fold selectivity for VAChT to σ receptors) (Jin et al., 2016, 2018; Liu et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2015). Although the clinical investigation of [18F]VAT in our institution is ongoing and shows promise, the actual binding characterizations of [18F]VAT toward VAChT in tissues had not been fully illustrated. The binding parameters such as Ki, Kd, Bmax values of the ligands need to be determined. In addition, the radioactivity distribution of [18F]VAT in other brain regions remain to be verified by immunohistochemistry staining study. The short half-life (110 min) of F-18 isotope makes it very challenging to fully characterize [18F]VAT binding toward VAChT in cells and animal brain tissues. To resolve the time constraints of [18F] VAT, tritiated [3H]VAT was used in current study. Both [18F]VAT, and its tritiated counterpart [3H]VAT share same chemical structure, thus their binding parameters and properties are expected to be similar or identical. The long half-life (12.6 year) of the H-3 isotope provides the time flexibility of accomplishing characterization experiments of [3H] VAT binding toward VAChT in cells and in brain tissue sections. The data generated by [3H]VAT will provide addition information for precisely interpreting the PET measurement with [18F]VAT in the brain of living subject, and help in delineating the mechanism of [18F]VAT toward VAChT in the brain. (Tu et al., 2015). VAT and its analogs are derivatives of vesamicol (Tu et al., 2015). Vesamicol is a potent VAChT inhibitor but it also has moderate binding affinity for σ-receptors (Efange et al., 1995a,b). Sigma receptors are concentrated in the CNS (Gundlach et al., 1986; Graybiel et al., 1989; Bouchard and Quirion, 1997; Aanonsen and Seybold, 1989) and can be found in many peripheral organs such as the liver, heart, lung, intestines, kidney, and reproductive organs (Wolfe et al., 1989; Kawamura et al., 1999; Kawamura et al., 2000). The lower selectivity of vesamicol for VAChT versus sigma receptors prevents it to be a suitable PET radiotracer, but inspired the search for more potent and selective VAChT radioligands (Altar and Marien, 1988; Rogers et al., 1989; Zea-Ponce et al., 2005. Barret et al., 2008; Mazere et al., 2008; Giboureau et al., 2010) by modifying the structure of vesamicol. This led to the discovery of [18F] VAT. In the saturation binding assay with membrane protein extracts, our data showed that [3H]VAT had strong binding potency to VAChT with Kd at 6.5 nM and Bmax at 22.89 pM. The Scatchard plot analysis of VAT data indicates a single binding site for the VAChT; this is consistent with the literature that vesamical binds with high affinity to an allosteric site of VAChT (Khare et al., 2009). In [3H]VAT competitive binding assay studies with a panel of cold CNS ligands, VAChT inhibitors including TZ6–59, TZ45–091B, VAT, and (−)-vesamicol, which is potent for both VAChT and the σ1 receptor, we were able to observe strong inhibition of [3H]VAT binding to VAChT. The cold compound VAT showed strong binding affinity to VAChT with Ki of 6.98 nM, higher than either VAChT-specific ligands FBBV (Ki = 24.7 nM) or (−)-vesamicol (Ki = 33.3 nM). Its binding affinity is similar to that of other two VAChT ligands from our laboratory, TZ45–091B and TZ6–59, having a Ki of 6.0 nM and 5.41 nM, respectively. No inhibition was detected using a panel of other no VAChT CNS protein inhibitors including a PDE10A ligand MP-10, a σ1 receptor ligand Yun-122, D2 receptor ligands (−)-eticlopride and (−)-quinpirole. The high specificity of [3H]VAT on VAChT binding is further confirmed by in vitro autoradiography with normal animal and human brain striatal sections. Furthermore, the [3H]VAT autoradiography signal shows an exemplary alignment with VAChT immunohistochemical staining signal in the human striatum sections. In the competitive [3H]VAT autoradiography with adjacent human striatal sections, the strong autoradiography signal was blocked significantly by either TZ6–59, a potent and specific VAChT ligand or (−)-vesamicol, but basically not blocked by σ1 receptor ligand Yun-122. The results of membrane protein binding assays and in vitro autoradiography studies clearly indicate the binding of [3H]VAT to VAChT with high potency and specificity.

For the rat brain sections, in vitro [3H]VAT autoradiography shows strong signal in striatum, moderate to high signal in vermis, thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus region, and weak signal in cerebellar cortex. For the nonhuman primate brain sections, strong [3H]VAT radioactivity signal also lighted up in striatum. For the human brain, strong [3H]VAT radioactivity signal in the putamen region was observed, weak radioactivity signal in the grey matter, and negligible signal in the white matter region of cerebellum tissue were observed. These radioactivity distributions of [3H]VAT assessed through the in vitro autoradiography study agree with our previous PET measurement using [18F]VAT (Jin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2015) that [18F]VAT displayed highest accumulation of [18F]VAT in the nonhuman primate striatum, followed by thalamus, hippocampus, frontal cortex, cerebellar vermis, and cerebellar cortex. Both our in vitro [3H]VAT autoradiography data and in vivo [18F]VAT PET imaging result agree with the reported distribution of VAChT in the brain (Gilmor et al., 1996).

Cholinergic pathways, distributing throughout the brain, play a critical role in modulating cognitive performances, learning and memory processes, cortical activity, cerebral blood flow, and other essential physiological functions (Schliebs and Arendt, 2006). Deficiency of cholinergic neurons and synapses contributes to progressive cognitive dysfunction in AD, PD, Huntington disease (HD), and other neurodegenerative disorders (Bohnen and Albin, 2011; Bohnen et al., 2003, 2018; Braak et al., 2004; Ferreira-Vieira et al., 2016; Pirker et al., 2003; Ransome and Hannan, 2012; Suzuki et al., 2002). VAChT, which is responsible for translocating acetylcholine from the cytoplasm into vesicles, provides a reliable biomarker for cholinergic neurons under normal (Efange, 2000; Haense et al., 2012; Kilbourn et al., 2009; Mulholland et al., 1998; Petrou et al., 2014; Prado et al., 2013) and neurodegenerative conditions (Aghourian et al., 2017; Bohnen and Albin, 2011; Bohnen et al., 2009). Cholinergic striatal deficits with decreased VAChT expressions and ChAT activities were observed in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Javoy-Agid, 1994; Ruberg et al., 1985; Suzuki et al., 2002). In this study, we performed a direct comparison between PSP and normal healthy control human postmortem brains on the striatum region with in vitro [3H]VAT autoradiography (Fig. 6). Strong autoradiography signal was observed in the striatum of normal and PSP human brain. The signal intensity (PSL/mm2) in the striatum from PSP human brains is significantly lower than that of normal human brains (Fig. 6), suggesting lower cholinergic neuron terminals or VAChT protein levels in the striatal region of PSP human brains compared to neurologically healthy human subjects. Our data is consistent with the outcome of Suzuki and his colleagues’ study in which they reported severe reductions of striatal VAChT in the PSP caudate nucleus and putamen (Suzuki et al., 2002). Nevertheless, the donors of these PSP human brains in our study were at very late stage of Parkinsonism with dementia and cognitive impairment. The postural instability and cognitive impairment of PSP are resulted from cholinergic deficits. Cholinergic dysfunction is related to the loss of cholinergic interneurons in the striatum. It was reported that SPECT imaging with [123I]IBVM targeting VAChT was able to detect the significant reduction in anterior cingulate cortical, innominatocortical, thalamic and pontothalamic VAChT levels, but failed to detect the severe reductions of striatal VAChT in PSP (Mazère et al., 2012) which could be resulted from the low sensitivity of SPECT imaging modality. A more sophisticated VAChT radiotracer with PET measurement might overcome the sensitivity challenge of SPECT measurement. Our in vitro autoradiography data reported here suggest that [3H]VAT is a promising VAChT radio-ligand to detect the cholinergic deficits of PSP human brains, especially the striatal region.

Our group reported previously that [18F]VAT with favorable pharmacokinetics is a promising PET tracer for imaging VAChT in the brain (Jin et al., 2018; Karimi et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2015). USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved [18F]VAT for human use to quantify VAChT in the brain. Currently, PET studies with [18F]VAT for measuring VAChT brain expression in the brains of healthy participants, patients with PD, dystonia and other neurodegenerative diseases is under progress in our institute and other medical centers. In this manuscript, we used autoradiography and immunohistochemical staining studies to characterize [3H]VAT, the tritiated counterpart of [18F]VAT, using cell membrane proteins, brain tissues from rats, nonhuman primate, healthy human controls, and patients with PSP. Our data indicate [3H]VAT possesses strong binding affinity (Kd = 6.5 nM, Ki = 6.98 nM) and selectivity to VAChT. Autoradiography study using [3H]VAT were able to detect the VAChT level changes in the putamen and caudate of PSP human striatal sections compared to tissue from healthy human control subjects.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, [3H]VAT, a tritiated counterpart of [18F]VAT, shows high potency and specificity to VAChT in the cell membrane-based binding assay, and brain sections through autoradiography studies. [3H]VAT enables the assessment of changes in VAChT expression in the striatum of PSP human brain sections compared to age-matched healthy controls. Because [18F]VAT and [3H]VAT share the same chemical and molecular structure, the physical binding parameters such Kd, Bmax, Ki that are generated from [3H]VAT on tissues should be applicable for [18F]VAT. These studies provide solid evidence supporting PET meaurementutilizing [18F]VAT as a promising biomarker to quantitatively measure VAChT levels in the brain of patients through noninvasive PET imaging. Further clinical investigation is warranted to confirm PET with [18F]VAT can be implemented to assess cognitive dysfunction of patients with dementia.
