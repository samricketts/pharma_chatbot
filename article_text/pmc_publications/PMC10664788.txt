Introduction:

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of small vessel cerebrovascular disease that are associated with cognitive decline and clinical Alzheimer’s disease. Previous studies have often focused on global or total WMH; less is known about associations of regional WMHs and cognitive abilities and among older adults without dementia.

Methods:

610 older adults with normal cognition (n=302) or mild cognitive impairment (n=308) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent neuropsychological testing and MRI. Linear regression models examined associations between regional WMH volumes and cognition, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele frequency, and pulse pressure.

Results:

Among all participants, greater regional WMH volume in all lobes was associated with poorer performance on memory and speed/executive functioning. Among participants with normal cognition, greater temporal and occipital WMH volumes were associated with poorer memory whereas no regional WMH volumes were associated with speed/executive function.

Discussion:

Results show that greater regional WMH volume relates to poorer cognitive functioning – even among those with normal cognition. Together with results from previous studies, our findings raise the possibility that WMH may be a useful therapeutic target and/or important effect modifier in treatment or prevention dementia trials.

pmcIntroduction

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are common in older adults.1,2 Although pathologically heterogenous, WMH are thought to reflect small vessel cerebrovascular disease3 and have been associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia including Alzheimer’s disease.4–8

Many previous studies examining associations of WMH and cognitive functioning have focused on global or total WMH volume9–11 although some studies have suggested differential relationships of regional WMH with specific cognitive abilities. Recent work by Moura and colleagues (2019) found that larger anterior WMH volume in particular was associated with poorer executive function12 although other studies have found that WMH impair executive function regardless of location.13 A recent study by Kamal and colleagues (2023) found that greater WMH volumes in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes were associated with poorer episodic memory and executive function among individuals with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment.14 Studies examining cognition categorically by comparing cognitive groups have demonstrated that WMH in parietal, temporal, and/or occipital regions in particular are most closely associated with subtle cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease.15,5,7,8

Given the relatively limited number of studies that have focused on the effect of regional WMH volumes on cognitive function, as well as inconsistent findings across studies, we sought to clarify the associations of lobar WMH volumes with episodic memory and executive function in a well-characterized sample of older adults who underwent neuropsychological assessment. We hypothesized that (1) greater frontal WMH volume would be associated with poorer executive functioning, and (2) greater parietal, temporal, and occipital WMH volumes would be associated with lower episodic memory performance.

Methods

The ADNI dataset

In preparation for this study, data were obtained from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI began in 2003 as public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to examine whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD.

Data availability

ADNI data were obtained from adni.loni.usc.edu and are accessible to scientific investigators who have been approved by the ADNI Data Sharing and Publication Committee and who agree to the terms of the ADNI Data Use Agreement for the purpose of the replication of procedures and results.

Participants

Enrollment criteria for ADNI 1 have been previously described in detail.16 Briefly, participants from ADNI ranged from 55 to 90 years old, had ≥ 6 years of education, were English or Spanish speakers, were free of any significant systemic illness or neurological disease, had a score of &lt;6 on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), had a score &lt;5 on the modified Hachinski Ischemic Scale, adequate vision and hearing for neuropsychological assessment, and had a reliable study partner. The current study included 608 older adults free of dementia who had available neuropsychological and lobar WMH volume at baseline. ADNI was approved by the institutional review boards at all the participating institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at each participating study site.

Cognitive groups

Participants were classified as having either normal cognition (CN) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) utilizing an actuarial neuropsychological diagnostic method.17,18 Six neuropsychological measures were used in this diagnostic classification and selected given their routine use in determining early cognitive changes in AD, they assessed multiple cognitive domains, and they have been used by numerous previous studies applying these criteria to classify MCI within ADNI.17,19,20 These six measures included two measures of episodic memory: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) 30-minute delayed free recall (number of words recalled) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test recognition (number of words correctly recognized minus false-positive errors); two measures of language Animal Fluency total score and 30-item Boston Naming Test total score; and two measures of speed/executive function: Trail Making Test, Parts A and B (times to completion). Raw neuropsychological scores for each measure were converted to an age-, education-, and sex-adjusted z-score based on a sample of individuals who remained classified as cognitively normal throughout their participation in the ADNI study.21,22 Participants were classified as MCI if they had an impaired score (defined as &gt;1 standard deviation below the demographically-adjusted normative mean) on both measures within at least one cognitive domain (i.e., memory, language, or speed/executive function) or had an impaired score (defined as &gt;1 standard deviation below the demographically-adjusted normative mean) on one measure in each of the 3 cognitive domains sampled. Participants who did not meet the actuarial neuropsychological MCI criteria were classified as cognitively normal.

Neuropsychological composites scores

Domain composite scores for episodic memory and speed/executive functioning were calculated as the mean of the two demographically adjusted z-scores within each domain. AS described above, the two measures of episodic memory were Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 30-minute delayed free recall and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test recognition. The two measures of speed/executive functioning were Trail Making Test, Parts A and B times to completion.

MR image acquisition

MRI data were collected as part of ADNI 1, the first phase of the ADNI project study. An in-depth description of ADNI MRI data acquisition is located online (https://www.loni.usc.edu). A standardized protocol was applied and verified across ADNI sites and platforms.23 All imaging was performed on 1.5 T systems. A 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (MP-RAGE) was acquired in the sagittal orientation. For WMH quantification, an additional proton density/T2-weighted fast spin each sequence (FSE) was obtained in the axial orientation. All imaging sites were required to pass phantom-based monitoring and scanner validation tests.23

MR image processing

MR imaging data used in this study were previously processed and downloaded from https://www.loni.usc.edu. Briefly, T1- weighted structural scans were motion-corrected and segmented and parcellated using an analysis based on FreeSurfer to obtain measures of total intracranial volume.24 WMH were detected using an automated method using co-registered T1-, T2-, and PD-weighted images.25,26 The T1-weighted image was skull stripped and nonlinearly aligned to a minimum deformation template.27,28 Nonbrain tissues were removed from T2- and PD-weighted images which were warped to the space of the minimum deformation format scan based on the T1 alignment and warping parameter. WMH were detected in minimum deformation template space based on image intensities of the PD, T1, and T2 images combined with a spatial prior (i.e., the prior probability of WMH occurring at a given voxel) and a contextual prior (i.e., the conditional probability of WMH occurring at a given voxel based on the presence of WMH at neighboring voxels). WMH volumes quantified with this method have been shown to agree strongly with WMH volumes estimated on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MR images).26 Regional WMH volumes of the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes were obtained using an a priori lobar atlas.29 To obtain volumes, voxels labeled as WMHs were summed and multiplied by voxel dimensions.

Statistical analyses

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Chi-squared (χ2) tests examined differences in demographic and clinical characteristics by cognitive group (CN, MCI). Hierarchical linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between regional WMH and cognition. Eight separate regression models were run. Each of the four regional WMH volumes were examined in two separate models: one model with the episodic memory composite score serving as the dependent variable and a second model with the speed/executive function composite score serving as the dependent variable. For all models, we adjusted for demographic data (i.e., age, sex, and education), APOE ε4 allele frequency (0, 1, 2), and pulse pressure (calculated as systolic blood pressure minus diastolic blood pressure). Pulse pressure was included as a covariate given the potential importance of arterial stiffness and blood pressure in WMH development.30 For all models, covariates were entered on Step 1 and regional WMH was entered as the independent variable of interest on Step 2. The distributions of WMH volumes were highly positively skewed for all regions, so a log-transformation was applied and transformed WMH volumes were used in all analyses.

Sensitivity analyses were performed examining whether the main results remained the same in the subgroup of CN participants (i.e., excluding participants with MCI). To address potential inflation of type I error resulting from multiple comparisons, we applied the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure31 to control the false discovery rate (FDR). For all analyses, we set alpha at .05 to test for statistical significance. Analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 28 (SPSS IBM, New York, USA).

Results

Participants characteristics

Demographic and clinical characteristics of the total sample and by cognitive status (CN versus MCI) are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the sample was 75.3 years and 40.1% of the sample were women. The sample was highly educated, with a mean education of 15.8 years. The MCI group was slightly younger, more likely to be APOE ε4 carriers, and, as expected, performed more poorly on episodic memory and speed/executive function measures relative to the CN group. There were no differences between the cognitive groups in terms of education, sex, race, ethnicity, or vascular risk burden (i.e., pulse pressure or Hachinski risk score).

Associations of regional WMH volume and cognitive performance across the entire sample

Adjusting for age, sex, education, APOE ε4 frequency, and pulse pressure, greater regional WMH volume in all four lobes was associated with worse episodic memory and worse speed/executive function performance across all participants. See Table 2 and Supplemental Figure 1 for associations with episodic memory and Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 2 for associations with speed/executive functioning.

Associations of regional WMH volume and cognitive performance among participants with normal cognition

When models were re-run in the subsample restricted to CN participants, adjusting for the covariates above, greater temporal and occipital WMH volume were associated with poorer episodic memory performance. Regional WMH volume was not associated with speed/executive function performance. See Table 4 and Supplemental Figure 3 for associations with episodic memory and Table 5 and Supplemental Figure 4 for associations with speed/executive functioning.

False discovery rate

Statistical significance of all reported findings was retained under a 0.05 FDR.

Discussion

In a large, well characterized sample of older adults free of dementia, we found that higher regional WMH volumes were associated with poorer functioning in cognitive abilities. Specifically, across the entire sample, we found higher WMH volume in all four lobes was associated with poorer episodic memory and speed/executive function. When the sample was restricted to CN participants only, findings were attenuated and only those associations between temporal and occipital WMH volumes and episodic memory remained significant. The pattern of findings suggests that WMH may affect multiple cognitive functions regardless of location although only occipital and temporal WMH were associated with cognition when including individuals with normal cognition only.

We hypothesized that frontal WMH volume would relate to speed/executive functioning whereas parietal, temporal, and occipital WMH volumes would be associated with episodic memory performance. Inconsistent with these regionally specific hypotheses, our findings across the entire sample showed that WMH related to speed/executive function and episodic memory regardless of location. Notably, our finding for speed/executive function is consistent with previous research suggesting that WMH may impair this domain regardless of location.13 Findings from previous studies relating regional WMH to episodic memory have been mixed, although frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital WMH volume have all been associated with this deficit in this cognitive domain.7,15,13,5,8 Notably most of these previous studies have focused on group comparisons of mean WMH volume among individuals with and without memory impairment or elevated risk for developing AD. In contrast, we examined neuropsychological performance as a continuous variable. We found that WMH may impair episodic memory and speed/executive function regardless of location which is consistent with evidence that WMH may disrupt networks and have both local and remote effects thereby affecting multiple cognitive domains.32,1

When we restricted analysis to the subsample of participants with normal cognition, it was revealed that temporal and occipital WMH in particular related to cognition, which is consistent with findings from previously published reports examining regional WMH-cognition associations across different groups.8 For instance, we previously showed that within the ADNI cohort individuals classified with objectively defined subtle cognitive decline show elevated temporal and occipital WMH volume relative to cognitively unimpaired adults.5 In addition, we previously showed that temporal and occipital WMH in particular predict decline in everyday functioning among older adults without clinical dementia. Others showed increased WMH volume particularly in posterior regions (and most prominently in occipital and parietal regions) among individual with autosomal dominant genetic mutation for AD.15 These results demonstrated that WMHs were present several years before the predicted onset of symptoms of dementia among individuals with autosomal dominant genetic mutations for AD, suggesting WMHs – particularly in posterior regions— reflect pathological changes that contribute to onset and progression of clinical symptoms. Taken together, this growing body of research examining regional WMH in aging and dementia risk suggest that WMH in temporal, parietal, and/or occipital regions may play a particularly important role in cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease risk.

There may be multiple pathways by which WMH affect cognition. WMH are pathologically heterogeneous and may reflect processes related to demyelination, axonal loss due to ischemia or neuronal death, microglia and endothelial activation, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy.3,33,15 Growing evidence highlights the heterogeneity of WMH pathophysiology and suggests that non-vascular mechanisms (e.g., neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation) could play a role in AD-related WMH.34 Overall, a better understanding of WMH heterogeneity may be important for precision medicine and predicting individual cognitive trajectories.

The present study is not without limitations, including the relatively homogeneous sample given participants were generally highly educated, white, and had relatively low vascular risk burden (i.e., potential participants were excluded for Hachinski Ischemic Scale scores &gt;4), which may result in our findings being less generalizable to other populations. However, although our sample is relatively healthy in terms of vascular risk, our results demonstrating WMH volume-cognition associations suggests that even relatively subtle cerebrovascular changes may affect cognition function. Another important limitation is the cross-sectional design, which limits our ability to make causal inferences or examine cognitive trajectories. Strengths of the present study include a well characterized and large sample of older adults enrolled in a national study on aging and AD, examination of multiple cognition domains, and quantification of regional WMH volumes.

In conclusion, we showed that greater WMH volume relates to poorer cognition in specific abilities among older adults without dementia. Among all participants, greater regional WMH volume in all lobes were associated with poorer performance on episodic memory and speed/executive functioning measures. Among participants with normal cognition only, greater temporal and occipital WMH volumes were associated with poorer episodic memory performance whereas regional WMH volumes were not associated with speed/executive function. Given this sample has relatively low vascular risk burden based on study inclusion criteria, results suggest that even relatively mild cerebrovascular changes may affect cognitive abilities. Future longitudinal studies should examine whether reducing modifiable vascular risk factors improves or slows decline in cognitive functioning and whether this relationship is mediated by WMH.
