Our recent investigation revealed that deficiency of NMDA receptor subunit GluN3A (NR3A) is a trigger for chronic neuronal hyperactivity and disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, leading to sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) phenotypes. The identification of an amyloid-independent pathogenesis was a surprise considering that GluN3A is a much less known NMDA receptor subunit with obscure function in aging adulthood, while the new concept of degenerative excitotoxicity as a decade-long pathogenic mechanism of AD/dementia remains to be further delineated. With negative observations in their GRIN3A−/− mouse, Verhaeghe et al. in their letter challenge the “odd” idea that lasting GluN3A deficiency is detrimental and responsible for the spontaneous progression of AD and cognition decline. We now discuss a potential mouse strain hypothesis and the experimental data in these two investigations, and provide additional evidence that further supports the validity and specificity of GluN3A deficiency in the development of AD and associated dementia.

pmcOur paper in Alzheimer &amp; Dementia[1] was a longitudinal investigation of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) GluN3A subunit knockout (KO) mouse and age-matched wild-type (WT) controls. Briefly, GluN3A KO mice exhibited a transition from chronically enhanced excitatory events to degenerative excitotoxicity and AD phenotypes[1]. Verhaeghe et al. now report no age-dependent cognitive decline in their GRIN3A−/− mouse and suppose that the discrepancy could be due to strain differences (i.e. 129/SvEv vs. C57BL/6). In our investigation, we maintained animals on the 129/Sv background by inbreeding for over 10 generations. Mice in experiments were derived from respective homozygous pairs and monitored by repeated genotyping. Homozygosity has never been maintained for &gt;4 generations to minimize genetic drifts. We periodically cross colonies to regain heterozygotes and obtain new homozygous breeders. Littermates produced by heterozygotes breeders were tested and similar results were verified[2]. We concur that divergent observations may be a result of different genetic profiles of two strains.

There are concerns about Verhaeghe’s animals and experiments. It is unclear whether their mice present enhanced NMDAR currents, neuronal hyperactivity, and chronic Ca2+ dysregulation, which are necessities in the absent of GluN3A. They show no data about excitotoxicity and expression of other NMDAR subunits. In Figure 1B of Verhaeghe’s letter, the cued fear memory was untested, while this memory is uniquely affected in C57BL/6 mice of similar ages[3]. Verhaeghe’s data also showed significant deviations from previous reports[1, 3]. For example, 14–26 months old C57BL/6 WT mice normally exhibit 60–80% freezing behaviors in the contextual fear conditioning test[3], while much less freezing response (~40%) was seen with Verhaegher’s WT mice. This deteriorated memory of WT mice is bound to have a direct impact on the comparison to their GRIN3A−/− mice which showed 60% freezing in the test, leading to the conclusion of enhanced memory of GRIN3A−/− mice. In their Figure 1C and 1D, the percentage of targeted quadrant occupancy is 30–40% with WT mice of 12–17 months old, which was worse than even much older C57BL/6 mice (~20-months old) that normally show 40–60% occupancy[4, 5]. These discrepancies indicate abnormal memory of Verhaeghe’s WT mice.

CaMKII signaling is Ca2+-dependent and its expression is upregulated in the absence of GluN3A or with increased activities of NMDARs[6, 7]. Peculiarly, there was no difference in the expression of CaMKII and pCaMKII between their WT and GRIN3A−/− brains, suggesting NMDAR activities and intracellular Ca2+ were unlikely upregulated. Figure 1E shows no difference in PSD-95 and synapsin1, which again is inconsistent with their declared memory enhancement of GRIN3A−/− mice. We detected a significant reduction of GluN3A in the occipital cortex of the human AD brain compared to age-matched controls[1]. Verhaeghe et al. did not present assessments of GluN3A in different brain regions. The age of AD and normal subjects in Verhaeghe’s study was mismatched with 15 years (76.8±6.3 vs. 61.3±9.2 years old, p=0.0005).

Besides the mouse of GluN3A “global” knockout throughout their entire life, we have tested the brain region specificity of GluN3A deficiency in AD/dementia development. Using a recombinant AAV packaged with SaCas9 and guide (g)RNA targeting GRIN3A, adult 129/Sv WT mice (3-month-old) were subjected to GluN3A selective knockdown (referred by sKO) in the hippocampus and cortex via bilateral injections (Fig. 1A). GluN3A sKO mice showed Aβ1–42 expression while no such amyloid was detected in age-matched or 18-month old WT mice (Fig. 1B). LTP induction in the hippocampus was impaired after sKO (Fig. 1C). In 3–6 months following the AAV or control injection, sKO mice underwent memory decline in the novel object test (Fig. 1F). In the Morris water maze (MWM) test, no cognition problem appeared at 3 months after sKO (SupplFig. 1A), but learning and spatial memory deficits appeared 6-month after sKO (Fig. 1E).

We restored the GluN3A expression in the hippocampus and cortex of 3-month-old GluN3A KO mice (Fig. 1F). Three months later, the GluN3A knock-in (KI) improved the learning activity to the normal level in MWM test (Fig. 1G, SupplFig. 1B). The Fear conditioning test demonstrated memory improvements in both contextual and cued memory of GluN3A KI mice (Fig. 1H, SupplFig. 1C). GluN3A KI fully prevented anxiety-like behavior in the open field test (SupplFig. 1D). We therefore conclude that the GluN3A deficiency, but not other factors, confers AD/dementia development.

There are ~2–10% people worldwide who carry mutated GRIN3 variants including null alleles with complete deficiency[8, 9]. GRIN3A alleles were suggested to be a risk factor for AD[10]. More investigations are warranted to delineate the consequences of GRIN3 mutations. We appreciate Verhaeghe’s letter that brings attention to the GluN3A role in degenerative excitotoxicity and AD/related-dementia pathogenesis.

Figure 1. Verifications of specific effects of GluN3A deficiency on the development of AD phenotypes in adult/aging mice

A. Injection of AAV9-CRISPR-GRIN3A into the bilateral cortex and hippocampus of 3-month old WT mice (male, 129/Sv background) significantly down-regulated the GluN3A protein expression examined using Western blotting. The data shown was measured at 3 months after virus injection. The assay also confirmed that the regional GluN3A knockdown (sKO is used here for a concise expression) disrupted the synaptic integrity shown as a reduced synapsin-1 (Syn-1) expression. N= 3 per group; *p&lt;0.05, unpaired t test. B. Three months after the regional GluN3A sKO (6 months old), Western blotting detected Aβ1–42 expression in the cortex while no similar bands were seen in the age-matched WT brain or the 18-months old WT brain. Quantification of this interim result did not yield statistical significance in one-way ANOVA (p&gt;0.05, n=4 brains/group). Consistently, expression of the endogenous β-secretase, β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), was detected in the mouse brain tissue (data not shown). As an ongoing investigation, additional brain samples of different ages will be measured. C. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic fEPSPs was recorded in hippocampus slices using the MultiElectrode Array (MEA) system. The recording was performed 6 months after sKO and showed attenuations of the LTP induction compared to WT controls. Representative traces of 4 recordings per group of different brains. D. The novel object test detected significant recognition memory deficit of sKO mice in remembering the novel object at 3-months and 6-months after GluN3A knockdown (n=7 per group, one-way ANOVA; *p&lt;0.05 of the sniff behavior between familiar and novel objects). E. The Morris water maze test was performed twice at 3 and 6 months after sKO. No significant differences were observed at the 3 months time point (see Supple. Figure 1A). The second MWM test at 6 months after sKO (9 months old) revealed significant deficits in learning and spatial memory compared to WT normal aging mice. N=6 and 12 per group for WT and sKO group, respectively; two-way or one-way ANOVA, *p&lt;0.05. F. In a gain of function study, the GluN3A expression in the “global” KO mouse brain was restored by injections of the AAV-GRIN3A virus into the bilateral cortex and hippocampus of young adult GluN3A KO mice (3 months old). Western blot analysis verified the expression of GluN3A in the adult WT brain, the absence of GluN3A in the conventional global KO brain, and restored expressions of GluN3A protein in the cortex (CTX) and hippocampus (HIP) 2 weeks and 3 months after GluN3A knock-in (KI). G. The Morris water maze test 3 months after GluN3A KI. The expression of GluN3A successfully rescued the learning function during the 5-day training. N=12, 9, and 3 in WT, GluN3A KO, and KO received GluN3A KI, respectively. One-way ANOVA. *p&lt;0.05. H. The fear conditioning memory test was performed with WT, GluN3A KO and KO mice received GluN3A KI. Three months after GluN3A KI in the global KO brain, animals showed a trend of improving contextual fear memory (see Supple. Figure 1C) and significantly enhanced cued fear memory of GluN3A KI mice. N=5 and 4 in GluN3A KO and KO received GluN3A KI group, respectively. Two-way ANOVA. Our continual investigation is delineating the critical time windows for GluN3A deficiency and the rescue effect of GluN3A restoration using multiple tests; more data will be added to each group according to the Power analysis.
