Background

Primary care is essential for persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Prior research suggests that the propensity to provide high-quality, continuous primary care varies by provider setting, but the settings used by Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligibles with ADRD have not been described at the population level.

Methods

Using 2012-2018 Medicare data, we identified dual-eligibles with ADRD. For each person-year, we identified primary care visits occurring in six settings. We calculated descriptive statistics for beneficiaries with a majority of visits in each setting, and conducted a k-means cluster analysis to determine utilization patterns, using the standardized count of primary care visits in each setting.

Results

Each year from 2012-2018, at least 45.6% of dual-eligibles with ADRD received a majority of their primary care in nursing facilities, while at least 25.2% did so in physician offices. Over time, the share relying on nursing facilities for primary care decreased by 5.2 percentage points, offset by growth in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and miscellaneous settings (2.3 percentage points each). Dual-eligibles relying on nursing facilities had more annual primary care visits (16.1) than those relying on other settings (range: 6.8 – 10.7 visits). Interpersonal care continuity was also higher in nursing facilities (97.0%) and physician offices (87.9%) than in FQHCs (54.2%), rural health clinics (RHCs, 46.6%), or hospital-based clinics (56.8%). Among dual-eligibles without care continuity, 82.7% were assigned to a cluster with few primary care visits.

Conclusions

A trend toward care in different settings likely reflects improved access to patient-centered primary care. Low rates of interpersonal care continuity in FQHCs, RHCs, and physician offices may warrant concern, unless providers in these settings function as a care team. Nonetheless, every health care system encounter presents an opportunity to designate a primary care provider for dual-eligibles with ADRD who use little or no primary care.

Primary Care

pmcIntroduction

Primary care is critical for persons with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia (ADRD). The most common forms of dementia are progressive, making it valuable for providers to maintain an ongoing relationship with these patients and their caregivers, and such relationships are a defining characteristic of primary care.1 However, not all persons with ADRD obtain continuous, high-quality primary care. For example, Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with ADRD have higher rates of hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (e.g., diabetes complications) than beneficiaries without ADRD,2–5 which generally result from comorbid conditions rather than hospitalization for dementia itself.6–7 Similarly, dementia is associated with an increased risk of 30-day rehospitalization.8–9 Because hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions may be avoided with effective management of chronic conditions and early treatment of acute illness,10–12 high rates of potentially-preventable hospitalizations are commonly considered to indicate inadequate primary care access.

One-third of Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD have low incomes that also make them eligible for Medicaid,13 which pays for long-term services and supports. The rate of ADRD among these “dual-eligibles” is more than three times that among Medicare-only beneficiaries (13% vs. 4%),13 and dual-eligibles also face more challenges with care coordination, long-term services and supports, and access to care.14 Consequently, dual-eligibles have 31% higher odds of potentially-preventable hospitalizations than their Medicare-only counterparts.15

Primary care continuity is associated with reduced rates of potentially-preventable hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD,2 and prior research also suggests that the propensity and capacity to provide high-quality, continuous primary care varies by provider setting. For example, patients of primary care providers who primarily treat nursing facility residents have fewer hospitalizations than older adults who obtain primary care from other providers.17 However, given the shortage of specialized training in the health care workforce,18 dual-eligibles with ADRD may receive primary care in outpatient settings that are less specialized in caring for older adults. Little is known about the settings in which dual-eligibles with ADRD obtain primary care,13 so we sought to describe them here. Considering the importance of primary care continuity in this population,2 we also analyzed patterns in the use of primary care settings by individuals without care continuity, to identify gaps where initiatives to increase continuity might be useful.

Methods

Sample

Using 100% Medicare claims and enrollment data from 2012-2018, we identified all dual-eligibles with a chronic condition flag for ADRD, based on an algorithm that underidentifies less severe cases, but has high specificity.19 Claims are not submitted for Medicare Advantage enrollees, so these enrollees are not included.

Primary Care Visits

Using predefined specialty codes and current procedural terminology codes in the Part B outpatient and carrier files (see Supplementary Appendix S1), we identified all primary care visits obtained by the study population. The CMS Certification Number and the place of service code allowed us to define each visit as occurring in one of six settings: nursing facility, physician office, hospital clinic, federally qualified health center (FQHC), rural health center (RHC) or miscellaneous settings (comprising such diverse settings as prisons, tribal health clinics, and urgent care clinics).

Race, Ethnicity, and Primary Care Continuity

Race and ethnicity were derived from the Research Triangle Institute enhanced race field in the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File, a field that uses addresses and surnames to improve the accuracy of race/ethnicity data listed in Medicare claims and enrollment data.20 It is important to consider race and ethnicity in this study because Black patients and low-income patients have poorer access to some primary care settings as a result of interpersonal and structural racism,21 an inequity that certain safety-net settings – especially FQHCs – aim to address.22 We also described primary care continuity, using a previously-validated definition (see Supplementary Appendix S1) that more closely approximates patient-reported care continuity than other claims-based measures.23 Care continuity measures included interpersonal (using visits to the same individual) and organizational (visits to the same organization – see Supplemental Appendix S1).

Statistical Analysis

We grouped person-years by the setting where the majority of primary care visits occurred, separately identifying groups with no primary care visits, and with no majority setting. We then calculated summary statistics on the demographics, health, and health care utilization for beneficiaries in each group. To identify typical patterns of primary care use among those without care continuity, we conducted a k-means cluster analysis on only those beneficiaries, based on the standardized count of primary care visits in each of the six settings described above. Cluster analysis is a method of identifying groups of observations whose characteristics on key variables are most similar.24 We used a scree plot to choose the solution with the optimal number of clusters, and calculated descriptive statistics for each cluster.

Results

In each year, at least 45.6% of dual-eligibles with ADRD received most of their primary care in nursing facilities, while at least 25.2% did so in physician offices (see Table 1). From 2012-2018, the share relying on nursing facilities decreased by 5.2 percentage points, which was largely offset by growth in FQHCs and miscellaneous settings (2.3 percentage points each), and in hospital clinics, physician offices, and no single majority setting. The share without primary care decreased from 6.9% to 4.8%.

As shown in Table 2, dual-eligibles receiving most care in nursing facilities were older than average, while dual-eligibles receiving care in FQHCs and hospital clinics, and those with no majority setting were younger. Black and Hispanic dual-eligibles were overrepresented in FQHCs and miscellaneous settings, while White dual-eligibles were overrepresented in nursing facilities and RHCs. Both FQHC and RHC users—as well as those receiving no primary care — were more likely than others to be rural residents.

Dual-eligibles whose original Medicare entitlement was due to disability comprised an above-average share of individuals with most care in FQHCs or miscellaneous settings. Dual-eligibles receiving care in miscellaneous settings – and in nursing facilities – also had a higher-than-average number of chronic conditions, while fewer chronic conditions were observed in those receiving primary care in FQHCs or no primary care at all.

Individuals receiving most of their care in nursing facilities had more primary care visits than average and higher rates of individual and organizational care continuity. Primary care visits and rates of care continuity were below-average for physician offices and RHCs. FQHCs demonstrated below-average rates of continuity despite a roughly average number of primary care visits.

Among individuals without interpersonal care continuity, a scree plot (see Supplementary Figure S1) identified an optimal grouping of seven clusters, shown in Table 3. One small cluster (n &lt; 11) is not presented. 83% of individuals were assigned to a cluster with few overall primary care visits. Smaller clusters were identified whose care centered around each individual setting, except nursing facilities. Despite lacking interpersonal care continuity, the average number of primary visits for the physician office, FQHC, RHC and miscellaneous clusters was at least 7.5 visits per year, and at least 21% of individuals in each of these clusters had organizational care continuity.

Discussion

From 2012-2018, dual-eligibles with ADRD obtained primary care mostly in nursing facilities and physician offices, but the share visiting FQHCs, RHCs, hospital clinics, and miscellaneous settings steadily increased. Care continuity was substantially lower in these growing settings. While most dual-eligibles with ADRD had a regular care provider, 16% lacked interpersonal care continuity. Of this group, most obtained few primary care visits.

Given the decrease in dual-eligibles with ADRD who receive no primary care, the growth of alternative primary care settings may reflect improved access to care, as well as the ability to make ADRD diagnoses earlier. Additionally, the greater availability of primary care in such settings may allow people with dementia to continue living in the community. During our study period (2012-2018), provisions of the Affordable Care Act were implemented – including the creation of an annual Medicare wellness visit without cost sharing, expanded funding for FQHCs and increased Medicare reimbursement for primary care providers25 – that may also have contributed to improved primary care access.

Considering the benefits of care continuity for dual-eligibles with ADRD,2,26 the finding that patients in growing settings have lower care continuity than those receiving care in nursing facilities and physician offices merits further investigation. Federal regulations require nursing facilities to obtain primary care for facility residents,27 and residents may simply have high interpersonal care continuity because facilities contract with a primary care provider to provide care for all residents. Nonetheless, given that Black and Hispanic patients in this study are overrepresented in FQHCs, and that rural residents are especially reliant on RHCs, the use of these settings may contribute to racial/ethnic and geographic inequities in care continuity. FQHCs—which also serve a growing share of the Medicare population as a whole28—should consider recruiting or training providers to ensure expertise in the care of older adults, particularly those with dementia. Dual-eligibles who receive care in miscellaneous settings may do so because they face specific challenges (e.g. incarceration) accessing more typical sources of primary care. Nonetheless, the low level of care continuity in these settings reinforces the importance of coordination between these settings and more “mainstream” primary care settings.

In FQHCs, RHCs, and hospital-based clinics, a large share of patients with ADRD maintained primary care continuity to an organizational provider. There is a need to better understand the value of organizational versus interpersonal continuity in these settings. Many FQHCs, for example, improved their ability to serve as patient-centered medical homes during this period.29 Dual-eligibles with ADRD who routinely obtain care in a patient-centered medical home may benefit from this model of care, but it remains important to understand whether this is a substitute for interpersonal care continuity.

We found differences between dual-eligibles based on the setting in which they received most primary care. Many differences were expected, such as the greater use of RHCs by dual-eligibles in rural areas and the greater use of FQHCs by Black dual-eligibles,22 but others were not. Dual-eligibles who received most primary care in a nursing facility obtained more than twice as many visits as those who relied on RHCs or physician offices. In part, this could be due to nursing facilities’ legal obligations surrounding the frequency of primary care,27 or the need for more frequent visits when patients’ health is poorer. However, the relationship between patient acuity and primary care visits is not consistent across all primary care settings; for example, dual-eligibles who use FQHCs have a relatively high visit count and relatively few chronic conditions. The difference in primary care visit counts across settings may reflect inadequate access to care in some cases.

The largest cluster of dual-eligibles without care continuity was those with few primary care visits. This highlights the importance of establishing care – and addressing access barriers – at each health care encounter. Most community-residing patients with ADRD rely on informal caregivers,30 and it is important to address barriers facing caregivers, including by offering flexibility in the timing and location of primary care appointments, and working with caregivers between appointments to resolve access barriers that arise. Although few dual-eligibles with ADRD receive no primary care, their existence is concerning and suggests that inpatient and specialty care settings should make similar efforts to establish primary care, through referrals and coordination with primary care providers. Medicare and other payers can incentivize these practices by including metrics of primary care continuity for beneficiaries with ADRD in accountable care and quality improvement programs.

This study is descriptive – relationships between demographic and health characteristics, primary care settings, and care continuity cannot be interpreted as causal. Additionally, the study is limited to Medicare-Medicaid dual-eligibles enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, and results may not generalize to other individuals with ADRD, especially if payer source is associated with the use of particular settings. Nonetheless, the study’s focus on dual-eligibles with ADRD provides important insights into a patient population that faces barriers to high-quality primary care.

The settings in which dual-eligibles with ADRD receive primary care have evolved, with such individuals relying less exclusively on nursing homes and physician offices than in the past. This trend may improve access to primary care for this population, but at the potential risk of lower interpersonal care continuity.

Key Points

While over 75% of dual-eligibles with ADRD rely on nursing facilities or physician offices for their primary care, the share receiving most of their primary care in nursing facilities declined from 2012-2018.

Over this time, the declining share of dual-eligibles with ADRD receiving primary care in nursing facilities has been offset by growth in the use of federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, hospital-based clinics, and other settings, leading to a reduction in the share of dual-eligibles with ADRD who receive no primary care at all.

However, dual-eligibles with ADRD who rely on federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics, or hospital-based clinics are much less likely to have interpersonal primary care continuity than those who receive most of their primary care in nursing facilities.

Why Does This Matter?

As the settings in which dual-eligibles with ADRD obtain primary care change, health care providers may need to modify their efforts to ensure high-quality, continuous primary care, especially in settings with less experience caring for persons with dementia.
