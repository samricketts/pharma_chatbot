Timely access and continuum of care in older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) is critical. This is a retrospective study on Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with ADRD diagnosis discharged to home with home health care following an episode of acute hospitalization. Our sample included 262,525 patients. White patients in rural areas have significantly higher odds of delay (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.06). Black patients in urban areas (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.12 - 1.19) and Hispanic patients in urban areas also were more likely to have a delay (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03 - 1.11). Black and Hispanic patients residing in urban areas had a higher likelihood of delay in home healthcare initiation following hospitalization compared to Whites residing in urban areas.

pmcIntroduction

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in the U.S. is very high: 6.5 million individuals over the age of 65.1 Individuals with ADRD have higher rates of emergency department visits and rehospitalizations, and longer stays during inpatient hospitalizations, compared to non-ADRD individuals, likely due to higher rates of comorbid conditions; the prevalence of acute events, such as falls; medication side effects; and infections.2–7 Irrespective of the underlying reasons, any hospitalization for older adults and those with ADRD in particular increases their vulnerability for deconditioning, resulting in poor functional outcomes, higher morbidity, and increased risk of mortality.8,9 Post-acute care aims to restore functional independence, reduce disability, and improve quality of life in skilled nursing facilities (SNF), inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF), or at home, using home health services (HH). If coordinated well, HH provides a comprehensive set of medical, nursing, rehabilitation therapy, social work, and other services for an extended period. The role of HH has grown significantly in recent years, and will continue to grow, for all patient populations. The advantages of using HH for individuals with ADRD are largely due to the care occurring in a familiar environment, which lowers the cognitive and psychological requirements for participation. In addition, home-based settings reduce the risk of secondary infections, which is of particular importance in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.10–12 Recently published studies have shown high utilization of HH by individuals with ADRD, and how this utilization varies with socio-demographic factors (e.g., race/ethnicity), and geographic region.10 However, the evidence is limited due to restricted samples and studies that do not focus on the underlying reasons associated with the utilization of HH or lack of it for this population.

The post-hospitalization transition to home is an especially vulnerable period for individuals with ADRD. If adequate, appropriate, and timely post-acute care is not provided, the risk of unwarranted outcomes (e.g., rehospitalization) increases. There is good evidence supporting the need for the timely initiation of HH after hospital discharge, with “timely” defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as within 48 hours of the referral or discharge (from the previous care) date.13 The timely initiation of HH lowers the risk of 30-day hospital readmission.14–16 This also has been developed into a quality measure-“How often the home health team began their patients’ care in a timely manner” for home health agencies as part of the CMS Quality Reporting Program (QRP).17 Despite these efforts, the rate of individuals receiving HH, especially the timely initiation of HH, is low, with reports suggesting that these rates are even lower for minorities, individuals dually enrolled under Medicare and Medicaid, and those living in rural areas and impoverished neighborhoods.14,15,18–21

Much of the literature on individuals with ADRD evaluates the quality of care in SNFs, but not HH. Individuals with ADRD receive poorer quality of care in nursing homes than those without ADRD, predisposing them to worse outcomes.22–24 Moreover, the impact of lower quality post-acute care services could be disproportional for racial/ethnic minorities living in rural areas that are typically underserved for health services. In rural areas, where there is limited availability of SNFs and IRFs,25,26 HH plays a vital role in providing multidisciplinary home-based nursing and rehabilitation care. Therefore, the timeliness of initiating HH is even more critical for those living in rural areas, after acute hospitalization, and for individuals with ADRD. While the evidence suggests that minorities receive care from lower-quality rated home health agencies,18,27–29 as yet we do not know the cumulative impact for minorities with ADRD and living in rural areas on timely initiation of HH after acute hospitalization.

Aims and Objectives

Before we can ensure equity of timely access to HH among racial and ethnic groups in rural areas, we must understand existing disparities in access and the quality of care among racial and ethnic groups with ADRD, particularly those living in rural areas. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the differences in the timing of the initiation of HH following acute hospitalization for ADRD patients by race/ethnicity and location (rural vs. urban).

Methods

Study design and ethics

We obtained the Institutional Review Board approval and established a Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) before conducting this study. For this observational work, we performed a secondary analysis of Medicare data for the years 2016-2017.

Data and variables

We used the Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) file to identify Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of ADRD. We then accessed Medicare inpatient claims data for these beneficiaries in standard analytical file (SAF) format for the years 2016-17, which allowed us to identify acute hospital episodes prior to the patients’ being discharged to HH. We linked these files with the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF) to obtain patient demographics (age, sex, race, enrollment in Medicare, dual eligibility, patient zip code). Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic White, Black, Hispanic, or Other (Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native or unknown). Finally, we linked SAF files to the post-acute care (PAC) assessment file: Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS, version C1ICD10 and C2) for home health, SAF files for home health claims, and revenue center file for home health. OASIS is a federally required and standardized assessment tool for adult home health care patients. Patients were followed for 14 days after hospital discharge. They were included in the study if they were discharged directly to HH following hospitalization, but were excluded if their HH was interrupted by another hospitalization. Other exclusions are detailed in the cohort exclusion chart in Figure 1. From the OASIS file, information was obtained for the patients’ status in function, pain, respiration, and living. Revenue center codes from the revenue center file were used to identify the type of HH provided. The Provider of Services file was used to retrieve home health agency characteristics, such as profit status, and whether the home health agency is part of a larger chain. We obtained home health ratings from Home Health Care Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HHCAHPS). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database provided information on social determinants of health variables in the patients’ zip code, defined by proportion of the population living in poverty. In addition, Medicare data was linked with the 2018 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data to reveal the concentration of nurse practitioners and physicians in the patients’ zip code. We also calculated the distance (in miles) between the beneficiary’s residence zip code and the home health agencies zip code. To calculate this distance, first, we obtained corresponding latitude and longitude for each zip code for both patients and home health agencies using the 2017 Gazetteer files from US Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html). After obtaining latitudes and longitudes for zip codes, we used Bing Maps Application Programming Interface (API) in Excel to compute driving distance between two zip codes in miles. After obtaining distances between two zip codes (patient and hom health), we used the observed distribution to categorize distance into three categories based on tertiles – low (cut off at 33.3 percentile), medium (cut off at 66.6 percentile) and high (above 66.6 percentile). The low category had distances of up to 9.7 miles between patient zip code and HHA zip code. The medium category had distances above 9.7 miles and up to 23.4 miles. The high category had distances above 23.4 miles. The 95th percentile for this variable was 97.9 miles. 12,767 observations had distances that exceeded 100 miles.

Primary Outcome

Our primary interest was in the latency in initiation of home health care after acute hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. We defined latency as HH starting more than two days after hospital discharge. We determined a binary outcome variable in which patients received care within two days or in more than two days after hospital discharge.

Study Population

The study data set included patients with ADRD admitted to HH after discharge from acute hospital care between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2017. The study cohort included Medicare fee-for-service claims for patients aged 66-100, who had a diagnosis of ADRD. From hospital claims and MBSF, patients were excluded if they (a) died during the index hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge, (b) left the hospital against medical advice, (c) had a missing length of stay during acute hospitalization, (d) were transferred to another acute care hospital, or (e) were enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans (we do not have complete data for patients in MA plans). Patients were also excluded if they did not directly go to HH after hospital discharge or if their HH was interrupted by another hospitalization.

Data Analysis

We used a chi-square test for categorical variables and two-sided unpaired t-test for continuous variables to analyze the association of covariates with latency in the initiation of HH. We reported continuous variables with means ± SDs and categorical variables with percentages. Bivariate analysis identified the characteristics of the patients, home health agencies, and neighborhoods associated with visits initiating at more than two days. Multilevel multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to account for clustering of patients within neighborhoods and to examine random effect of these neighborhood characteristics on HH latency, which was adjusted in models. Also, we adjusted for patient-level factors (e.g., socio-demographic variables, clinical variables, comorbidities, and functional status). Bivariate analyses are reported in Tables 1 and 2. For all analyses, factors with P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and results from the two regression models are reported in Table A1 (Appendix). All analyses were done using SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).

Results

In our study cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD, 57.3% started HH within two days of discharge from acute hospitals, 21.6% between three and seven days, 8.4% between eight and 10 days, and 12.8% between 11 and 14 days (Figure 2). About 46% of individuals of other race/ethnicity in rural areas received HH more than two days out, while 45% of Black patients in urban areas received care more than two days (Figure 3). Using our operationally defined home health latency variable (yes/no), we conducted bivariate analyses investigating the association of various patient, institution, and neighborhood characteristics with home health latency. Patients who received HH at three or more days after discharge, were more likely to be female, Black, Medicare-Medicaid non-dual eligible, and living in rural setting (Table 1). Other patient-level clinical factors that were associated with a delay in rehabilitation care were longer length of hospital stay, hospital acquired conditions, ICU admission, and functional status. Patients who lived alone were significantly more likely to have a delay in HH. Finally, neighborhood characteristics such as: home health agency concentration, poverty status, and physician/NP concentration also were associated with home health latency (Table 1).

In Table 2, we present the results of two regression models with the initiation of HH care. Model 1 shows the association of race and location with an interaction term between the two. In the presence of the interaction term, there is not a significant association of the main effects of race and location to delay in initiation of care. Since the interaction term is statistically significant (p-value &lt;0.001), the association of race with delay in home health care may be conditionally affected by the beneficiary’s location. To better understand this, we created eight mutually exclusive groups using the race and location variables (non-Hispanic Whites in urban areas, non-Hispanic Whites in rural areas, Blacks in urban areas, Blacks in rural areas, Hispanics in urban areas, Hispanics in rural areas, Other minority races in urban areas, and Other minority races in rural areas). We used these groups in Model 2 to show differences and association with patient, institution, and neighborhood characteristics (Table 2). From Model 2, we found that compared to Whites in urban areas, Blacks in urban areas have the highest odds of delay in initiation of HH care (OR=1.15; 95% CI=1.12 - 1.19) followed by Hispanics in urban areas (OR=1.07; 95% CI= 1.03 - 1.11). While we do not observe a significant association with timing of care for Blacks and Hispanics in rural areas, we find that Whites in rural areas have slightly higher odds of receiving delayed care compared to Whites in urban areas (OR=1.03; 95% CI=1.01 - 1.06)

Discussion

The overarching objective of this study is to examine the association between the timely initiation of HH after acute hospitalization and race/ethnicity for individuals with ADRD. We found that Blacks in urban areas had the highest likelihood of delay. However, the urban/rural differences were dependent on race/ethnicity, where Whites in rural areas had a higher likelihood of delay, while for Hispanics those in urban areas had higher likelihood of delay.

The timely initiation of HH is an important marker for the quality of care and has a positive effect on health outcomes.14,16,20,27,30,31 This has become even more important with the implementation of Patient-Driven Groupings Model (PDGM) a value-based payment model for home health.32 The initiation of HH is a quality measure that is part of the home health star rating system, a publicly available platform to compare performances of home health agencies.17,33 However, none of the prior studies have examined the timely initiation of HH in individuals with ADRD and compared differences with racial or location information. We argue that the examination of a process of care measure, such as the timely initiation of HH, is important for individuals with ADRD, who are even more vulnerable, after acute hospitalization, and any lag in the start of home-based services could have detrimental effects on their health outcomes. We also argue that examination of racial/ethnicity disparities needs to be done carefully by considering the complex relationships between race/ethnicity, living situation (rural vs urban), while accounting for individual-level differences (e.g., sociodemographic factors, severity of condition, and functional status), provider-level factors, and neighborhood characteristics (e.g., availability of resources and providers).

According to a recently published Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report, over 99% of Medicare beneficiaries live in a county served by at least one home health agency, and approximately 88% live in a county served by more than five home health agencies.34 However, there is a discrepancy between the availability of HH and the (actual) utilization of HH.35–38 We found an overall positive association between rural residents and the timely initiation of HH, similar to a previously published study.36 While it is difficult to tease out all of the factors associated with the timely initiation of HH in rural settings, one plausible explanation is that there is a smaller volume of patients discharged from a smaller number of acute hospitals (critical access hospitals) to a smaller network of home health agencies.35,36 Thus, there is better alignment and coordination of services between acute discharges and initiating HH. In urban settings where a larger number of patients are discharged from a greater number of hospitals with a higher number of home health agencies, achieving efficiency in care coordination can be problematic. We also found that the association between those in other race/ethnicity category (Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native or unknown) and location (urban and rural) is inconclusive. Future work with more years of data can provide adequate sample size for these race/ethnicity categories to tease out within group differences. We observed these patterns among Black and Hispanic patients. However, for White ADRD patients, delay in HH initiation was significantly higher in rural areas versus urban areas. Our findings show that the urban/rural differences in the delay of HH initiation were inconsistent for all racial/ethnic groups. Timely access to home health services remain to be challenging for older adults, especially those with ADRD from minority background living in rural areas. In recent years, care coordination between acute and post-acute care services has improved for those conditions under voluntary or mandatory episode-based payment models (e.g., bundled payment care initiatives). However, strategies for translating positive effect of those demonstration projects to other chronic conditions to improve care coordination and ultimately health outcomes is needed.

Limitations

There are a few limitations in our study. First, our study sample was restricted to individuals enrolled under the traditional Medicare fee-for-service plan and did not include those enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. Also, we only used 100% nationally representative Medicare data for one year, 2016-2017. Second, we did not account for acute and home health ownership or contractual arrangements nor did we examine network compositions within a given region. These are important attributes that can determine care coordination between acute hospitals and home health agencies and need to be examined in future work. Third, this study does not include other patient-level barriers (e.g., caregiver availability and level of support) and home health logistical challenges (e.g., staffing shortages, enchantment areas), which may explain the variations in care delays. Finally, we did not examine any patient-level outcomes, as the primary purpose was to investigate the differences in a home health process of care variable (timely initiation of HH). These results need to be interpreted in light of ongoing COVID-related disruptions in access to home health services. While our purpose was to examine association between race and location in access to timely initiation of HH services, future studies looking at disruptions due to the pandemic and how that has impacted timely initiation of HH services is important. Future research examining the association between early versus late initiation of HH with patient outcomes is needed.

Conclusion

This cohort analysis found significant disparities between White ADRD patients living in rural areas and Black and Hispanic ADRD patients living in urban areas in the delay of the onset of HH following hospitalizations. Such a delay in HH may have unintended consequences on health outcomes in minority and disadvantaged populations. Further research is needed to identify structural barriers that prevent disadvantaged patients from accessing an equitable and timely continuum of care. Given the recent disruption in health care delivery due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the implementation of timely HH, our findings are crucial in shaping equity policy for frail and vulnerable patient populations.
