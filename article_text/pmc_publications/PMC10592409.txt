INTRODUCTION:

Atypical variants of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include the visual variant, known as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and the language variant, known as logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). Clinically, rates of disease progression differ between them.

METHODS:

We evaluated 34 PCA and 29 LPA participants. Structural magnetic resonance imaging and 18F-flortaucipir positron emission tomography were performed at baseline and one-year follow-up. Rates of change in tau uptake and grey matter volumes were compared between PCA and LPA with linear mixed-effects models and voxel-based analyses.

RESULTS:

PCA had faster rates of occipital atrophy. LPA had faster rates of left temporal atrophy and faster rates of tau accumulation in parietal, right temporal, and occipital lobes. Age was negatively associated with rates of atrophy and tau accumulation.

DISCUSSION:

Longitudinal patterns of neuroimaging abnormalities differed between PCA and LPA, although with divergent results for tau accumulation and atrophy.

pmcBACKGROUND

Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)1 and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA)2 are two of the most common atypical variants of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with clinical impairment predominantly in the visual and language domains, respectively. PCA and LPA typically show different cross-sectional patterns of atrophy and tau deposition, which mirror clinical symptoms, with prominent occipital involvement in PCA and prominent left temporal involvement in LPA3,4.

AD patients show heterogeneity in disease progression.5 We and others have previously shown that longitudinal patterns of atrophy mirror the baseline signature patterns in these AD syndromes, while patterns of tau uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) tend to differ from the baseline patterns and converge, with both syndromes showing fastest rates of frontal tau accumulation over time.6,7 Consistently, regions that carry the highest tau-PET burden at baseline show a plateau or even decline of uptake over time across atypical AD syndromes.8 Little, however, is known about how LPA and PCA differ in longitudinal rates of atrophy and tau accumulation. We found limited differences in longitudinal rates of imaging abnormalities when directly comparing 17 PCA and 22 LPA.9 One other study observed faster rates of atrophy in the left temporal lobe in 25 LPA compared to 20 PCA, with PCA not showing faster rates of atrophy than LPA anywhere in the brain.30 Clinically, PCA and LPA might differ in the rapidity of their disease course, with LPA declining faster than PCA.10 However, it is unclear whether the difference in the rate of disease progression is a peculiarity of the phenotype or a consequence of differences in age at onset and disease stage.10

Phenotype-specific temporal trajectories of neuroimaging abnormalities, particularly tau-PET uptake, are important as neuroimaging quantities are serving as secondary or surrogate endpoints in clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of disease-modifying treatments, such as anti-amyloid therapies, in AD. PCA and LPA differ in their most prominent sites of initial tau deposition on tau-PET. Assuming that tau spreads trans-synaptically, the accumulation of tau pathology over time might be facilitated when the regions with high tau burden are functionally connected to the rest of the brain, with a slower spreading if such regions are instead part of segregated networks.11 This would lead to differences in rates of tau accumulation between PCA and LPA.

The aim of the current work was to determine whether PCA and LPA differ in rates of atrophy and tau accumulation. We hypothesized that each phenotype would show faster rates of atrophy in the regions most atrophied at baseline. We also hypothesized that rates of tau accumulation will be different between the two phenotypes in their signature regions, but similar in those regions that do not have high levels of pathology at baseline, like the frontal lobe.

METHODS

Participants

Sixty-three atypical AD participants (34 meeting clinical criteria for PCA 12 and 29 meeting clinical criteria for LPA 2) were included in the study. Participants were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG; PI’s Josephs and Whitwell) between 2016 and 2022 and underwent structural MRI, [11C]Pittsburgh Compound B PET for amyloid-beta (Aβ), and [18F]flortaucipir PET for tau at baseline and one-year follow-up. Two PCA participants underwent one more follow-up scan, for a total of 3 scans, all one year apart. One PCA and one LPA participant underwent two more follow-up scans, for a total of 4 scans, all one year apart. The Aβ PET scans were analyzed to determine Aβ positivity as previously described 13, and all participants were determined to be Aβ(+) at baseline, except for one who converted to positivity at the follow-up visit. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was performed on 61 participants. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB, and all participants provided written informed consent to participate in this study.

Clinical evaluation

All participants underwent a clinical and neuropsychological evaluation,14 including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)15 to assess general cognitive function, the 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT)16 to assess confrontational naming, the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE)17 repetition subtest for sentence repetition, the Visual Object and Space Perception (VOSP) incomplete letter and cubes tests18 to assess visuoperceptual and visuospatial functioning, respectively, and the Rey-Osterrieth (Rey-O) Complex Figure Copy19 to assess visuoconstruction. Diagnostic PCA features that were assessed included: oculomotor apraxia (inability to voluntarily direct one’s gaze to a particular point), optic ataxia (impairment of goal-directed hand movements toward visually presented targets), Gerstmann syndrome (acalculia, left-right confusion, agraphia, or finger agnosia), and visual field deficit. The severity of simultanagnosia was determined on a 20-point scale with 20 being the best score and scores under 17 considered abnormal. The simultanagnosia test was designed to assess the ability to perceive the overall meaning or shape of a figure and included images of overlapping line drawings, images of fragmented numbers, and Navon figures.

Image acquisition

All PET scans were acquired using PET/CT scanners (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin or Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) operating in 3D mode. For tau-PET, an intravenous bolus injection of approximately 370MBq (range 333-407 MBq) of [18F]flortaucipir was administered, followed by a 20-minute PET acquisition performed 80 minutes after injection. For Aβ-PET, participants were injected with [11C]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) of approximately 628 MBq (range 385-723 MBq) and, after a 40–60-minute uptake period, a 20-minute PiB scan was obtained. Both PiB and flortaucipir PET scans consisted of four 5-minute dynamic frames following a low dose CT transmission scan. Standard corrections were applied. Emission data were reconstructed into a 256x256 matrix with a 30-cm field of view (in-plane pixel size=1.0mm). Flortaucipir PET scans were performed at baseline and at one-year follow-up. All participants also underwent a 3T head MRI protocol at both time-points that included a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR/TE/TI, 2300/3/900 ms; flip angle 8°, 26-cm field of view; 256×256 in-plane matrix with a phase field of view of 0.94, and slice thickness of 1.2 mm20). The MRI scans were performed on one of two GE scanners (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) with identical protocols, with 39 out of 48 longitudinal scans performed on the same scanner at baseline and follow-up. The MRI scans were performed a median of one day from the PET scans at both baseline and follow-up. Fifteen participants had their follow-up scans performed on Siemens scanners (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) and were therefore excluded from the analyses on longitudinal rates of atrophy but included in the analyses on longitudinal tau.21 Therefore, rates of atrophy were analyzed on 48 participants (23 PCA and 25 LPA).

Image analysis

MRI Analysis:

Each MPRAGE was segmented and bias-field corrected using Unified Segmentation22 in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK), with MCALT tissue priors and settings.23 Using ANTs,24 the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt/) was propagated to the native MPRAGE space and used to propagate MCALT atlases to MRI space for region-level measurements. Lobar grey matter (GM) volumes were calculated using the MCALT lobar atlas. Global GM volume was calculated as the sum of GM volumes across all lobes. Mean annualized GM log Jacobians (i.e., annualized percent change in GM volume) were computed with an in-house developed version of tensor-based morphometry using symmetric normalization (TBM-SyN) to estimate longitudinal changes in GM volume25 in the four left and right lobes.

PET Analysis:

PET images were rigidly registered to the corresponding MPRAGE using SPM12. Tau-PET median regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) were then calculated in voxels segmented as grey or white matter with the cerebellar crus GM as the reference region. Tau-PET SUVR images and GM segmentations were spatially normalized to the MCALT template and blurred with a 6- and 8-mm full width at half maximum kernel, respectively, for voxel-based analyses with SPM12.

In addition to this procedure, SUVR were also computed using a different, specialized pipeline to measure change over time in tau PET.26 This pipeline was designed to minimize all possible sources of software quantification-related variance by performing all of each participant’s processing and measurements in a common single-subject template space with a single rigid registration between all MRI and PET images, and a single atlas registration/parcellation across all time points. Briefly, all PET scans for each participant (over time) were rigidly group-wise coregistered to form a PET single-subject template (SST). All MPRAGE MRI scans for each participant (over time) were group-wise rigidly coregistered, harmonized for inhomogeneity artifacts using differential bias correction, and non-linearly registered using ANTS buildTemplateParallel27 to form an MRI SST. All coregistered, bias-harmonized MRI were resampled to this space and segmented using Unified Segmentation. A single non-linear registration was computed between the MRI SST and MCALT space and used to propagate atlas labels to MRI-SST space. A single affine registration was computed between the PET-SST and the MRI-SST and used to transform all PET scans to MRI-SST space. Regional median SUVR values were then computed in MRI-SST space, using a composite reference region including eroded supratentorial WM, pons, and whole cerebellum, with two-compartment partial volume correction (PVC).28

Lobar tau-PET SUVR were obtained with the MCALT lobar atlas. Annualized rates of change in tau-PET SUVR were calculated as the difference between follow-up and baseline values, divided by the year difference between the two scans. Global tau-PET SUVR was calculated as the weighted median of SUVR across all lobes, with the weight being the number of voxels in each lobe.

Statistical analyses

Baseline characteristics were compared between LPA and PCA with Fisher’s exact test for categorial variables and Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables.

Mixed-effects models

Longitudinal linear mixed-effects models were fit to assess the effects of diagnosis on rates of change in tau-PET SUVRs (Equation 1) and GM volumes (Equation 2). The response variables were log-transformed to reduce skewness and address nonconstant variance or proportional errors. Diagnosis (DX, i.e., PCA or LPA), time, APOE ε4 status, age at the time of the first scan, sex, and the interaction between time and diagnosis and age and time were included as fixed effects. The GM volumes model also included total intracranial volume (TIV) as a fixed effect. The regression parameter of primary interest was the interaction between time and diagnosis, which corresponds to the mean difference in annual rates of change between LPA and PCA. The models were constructed using all the available data points for each participant, since 4 participants had more than 2 longitudinal PET scans. The models included subject-specific random intercepts and slopes. The GM volumes models did not include a random slope due having at most two time points per person. Time was expressed as years from first scan and had an origin of zero. For rates of atrophy, linear models were also created with annualized GM log Jacobians as the response variable and age, sex, APOE ε4 status and diagnosis as the predictive variables (Equation 3). The annualized GM log Jacobians estimate change in GM volume more accurately than single-point GM volume values. Since Jacobians can be interpreted as percent volume change over time, it is not necessary to include TIV in the model. Separate models were created for each lobe on the left and right hemispheres and for bilateral lobes.

Equation (2) GM volume~sex+APOE+age+TIV+time+DX+DX:time+age:time+(1|participant)

Equation (3) Annualized GM log Jacobians~sex+APOE+age+DX

Results from lobar-specific models were validated with a single model including all left and right lobar values, a random intercept for each participant and a random intercept and slope for each lobe and diagnosis. These longitudinal linear mixed-effects models were fit on the annualized rates of change in tau-PET SUVR calculated from baseline to the first follow-up scan (Equation 4) and on the annualized GM log Jacobians (Equation 5). APOE ε4 status, age at the time of the first scan, sex and diagnosis were included as fixed effects. The model on annualized tau-PET SUVR change included the baseline global tau-PET SUVR as a covariate.

Equation (5) Annualized GM log Jacobians~sex+APOE+age+DX+(1+DX|lobe)+(1|participant)

Mixed-effects models that included tau-PET SUVR were run on SUVR calculated relative to the composite reference region and with PVC, which is optimal for estimating time effects, i.e., the primary effects of interest. The models were also re-run on SUVR calculated relative to the cerebellar crus GM without PVC, and results are reported as supplemental. The regression parameters of interest were summarized from each model in terms of point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) displayed in figures and tables. Ninety-five percent CIs that do not include zero correspond to a significant effect at p &lt;0.05. All models were fit with the lm or lmer functions in the lme4 package in R version 4.2.2.

Voxel-based analyses

Paired t-tests on tau-PET baseline and follow-up images and one-sample t-tests on annualized GM log Jacobians were performed separately on the PCA and LPA cohorts to investigate longitudinal imaging abnormalities. Multiple regression analyses were performed on the annualized rates of change in tau-PET SUVR and the annualized GM log Jacobians images, covarying for age and for baseline global tau-PET SUVR in (for the tau-PET analysis), to compare PCA and LPA. Multiple regression analyses were also performed on baseline and follow-up tau-PET SUVR and GM segmentations to compare PCA and LPA. Results were extracted uncorrected at p&lt;0.001 and with family wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons at p&lt;0.05. Tau-PET SUVR images for voxel-based analyses were obtained with the cerebellar crus GM as the reference region and without PVC. Analyses were performed in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK).

RESULTS

Participants

Groups did not differ in age, APOE ε4 status, baseline global tau-PET SUVR and GM volume calculated across all lobes (Table 1). LPA participants were older and had shorter disease duration than PCA, but the differences were not statistically significant. Demographic and clinical characteristics were not statistically different between PCA and LPA in the subsets of 48 participants with follow-up MRI (Supplemental Table 1).

Clinically, PCA and LPA did not differ in their baseline MoCA and BNT scores and prevalence of Gerstmann syndrome, while PCA performed worse on Rey-O, Simultanagnosia, VOSP letters, VOSP cubes and LPA performed worse on BDAE repetition (p&lt;0.001) (Table 1). Oculomotor apraxia (p=0.02), optic ataxia (p&lt;0.001) and visual field deficit (p=0.001) were significantly more common in PCA patients than in LPA patients (Table 1).

Mixed-effects models

In the lobe-specific models, LPA had significantly faster rates of tau accumulation than PCA in the right parietal (β=−0.031, p=0.007), right temporal (β=−0.026, p=0.009), and right (β=−0.040, p=0.005) and left (β=−0.040, p&lt;0.001) occipital lobes and faster rates of decline in GM volume in the left temporal lobe (β=0.520, p=0.05) (Table 2). When rates of atrophy were evaluated with annualized GM log Jacobians, PCA had significantly faster rates of atrophy (i.e., higher GM log Jacobians) than LPA in the right (β=0.015, p&lt;0.001) and left (β=0.013, p=0.001) occipital lobes (Table 3). Estimates of the left temporal and left frontal annualized GM log Jacobians were higher for LPA, but the difference with PCA did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). Given previous findings of faster left temporal atrophy in LPA relative to PCA,29 we repeated the analyses in all the left temporal regions of the MCALT atlas. Analyses with the MCALT atlas revealed statistically significantly lower annualized GM log Jacobians in LPA patients in the left superior temporal pole (β=−0.017, p=0.02). In the lobar models, cross-sectionally, LPA participants had higher tau-PET SUVR than PCA in the left temporal lobe (β=−0.136, p&lt;0.001). PCA participants had instead higher cross-sectional tau-PET SUVR in the bilateral occipital lobe (β=0.253, p&lt;0.001). PCA had smaller GM volumes in the bilateral occipital lobe (β=−8.112, p&lt;0.001) and larger volumes in the left temporal lobe (β=2.732, p=0.04) than LPA, cross-sectionally. Age had a statistically significant negative effect on tau-PET SUVR in all the lobar models (bilateral frontal: β=−0.010, p=0.001; parietal: β=−0.210, p&lt;0.001; temporal: β=−0.085, p&lt;0.001; occipital: β=−0.079, p=0.05), with younger participants having more tau. Time had a statistically significant positive effect on tau-PET SUVR in all the lobar models (bilateral frontal: β=0.040, p&lt;0.001; parietal: β=0.044, p&lt;0.001; temporal: β=0.030, p&lt;0.001; occipital: β=0.048, p&lt;0.001). In the tau-PET SUVR lobar models, there was a statistically significant negative interaction between age and time in the right frontal lobe (β=−0.018, p&lt;0.001) and in the right occipital lobe (β=−0.021, p=0.05), with younger participants accumulating tau faster over time. In the GM lobar models, age had a negative effect on the right occipital lobe volume (β=−1.605, p=0.03), with older participants having smaller volumes, and time had a negative effect on the volumes of all lobes (bilateral frontal: β=−3.872, p=0.002; parietal: β=−3.076, p&lt;0.001; temporal: β=−4.073, p&lt;0.001; occipital: β=−2.081, p&lt;0.001). In the GM volumes lobar models, there was a positive interaction between age and time in the right frontal (β=1.326, p=0.02), left parietal (β=0.570, p=0.04) and right temporal (β=0.632, p&lt;0.001) lobes, with older participants losing GM more slowly over time. In the annualized GM log Jacobians models, age had a statistically significant negative effect in the right frontal (β=−0.004, p=0.03) and bilateral parietal (β=−0.005, p=0.010) lobes, with younger participants having faster rates of atrophy.

Supplemental Figure 1 shows the raw data used in the mixed-effects models. One PCA participant showed a particularly striking decrease in tau-PET SUVR over time in right temporoparietal and bilateral occipital lobes (69 years old, 3.5 year of disease duration, baseline global tau-PET SUVR: 2.2, follow-up global tau-PET SUVR: 1.8, baseline MoCA: 12, follow-up MoCA; 8). Removing this participant did not alter the results of the lobar-level mixed-effects models.

When tau-PET SUVR were calculated relative to the cerebellar crus GM without PVC the results were similar, although LPA participants showed only a trend for faster rates of tau accumulation than PCA in the right parietal and right temporal lobe, with the difference not reaching statistical significance (Supplemental Table 2). When all left and right lobes were analyzed together in the same mixed-effects model (i.e., model with a total of 8 regions), age (β=−0.02, p=0.02) was negatively associated with rates of tau accumulation, and rates of tau accumulation were faster in LPA relative to PCA (β=−0.04, p=0.06), although the difference did not reach statistical significance (Figure 1A). Baseline global tau-PET SUVR had a negative effect on rates of tau accumulation, but it was not statistically significant (β=−0.08, p=0.08) (Figure 1A). When the same model was run on annualized tau-PET SUVR change computed relative to the cerebellar crus GM and without PVC, there was a trend for faster tau accumulation in participants who were younger (β=−0.03, p=0.06) and with lower baseline global tau-PET SUVR (β=−0.13, p=0.06), and no difference between PCA and LPA (Supplemental Figure 2). When all lobes were analyzed together, annualized GM log Jacobians were higher in younger participants (β=−0.003, p=0.05), with no difference between PCA and LPA (Figure 1B).

Voxel-level analyses

Results of the voxel-level analyses mirrored the ones from mixed-effects models. On paired t-tests between baseline and first follow-up scan, PCA showed tau accumulation in frontal and right temporal lobes at p&lt;0.001, with only a few voxels in the left frontal regions surviving FWE correction at p&lt;0.05 (Figure 2A). In contrast, LPA participants showed tau-PET SUVR increase over time diffusively across the brain, except the left temporal lobe, with many areas surviving FWE correction at p&lt;0.05, particularly in the frontal lobes (Figure 2A). When annualized rates of change in tau-PET SUVR were compared directly between diagnoses, covarying for age and baseline global tau-PET SUVR, LPA showed faster rates of tau accumulation in the bilateral occipital, right parietal and left frontal lobes at p&lt;0.001 (Figure 2C). Results from the direct comparison did not survive FWE correction for multiple comparisons.

On one-sample t-tests, PCA showed significant annualized GM log Jacobians in the occipitotemporal lobe and LPA in the left temporal lobe, but also right temporal and frontal lobes (Figure 2B). When annualized GM log Jacobians were directly compared between PCA and LPA, covarying for age, PCA showed faster rates in the occipital and parietal lobes at p&lt;0.001 (Figure 2C). LPA had higher Jacobians than PCA in the left temporal lobe, but the difference did not survive the statistical threshold of p&lt;0.001, and it was only detectable with a threshold of p&lt;0.05 (Supplemental Figure 3). Results from the direct comparison did not survive FWE correction for multiple comparisons, except for a few voxels in the right fusiform and lingual gyrus.

Supplemental Figure 4 reports results from voxel-level multiple regression analyses between PCA and LPA for tau-PET SUVR and MRI GM volume at baseline and first follow-up visit. On tau-PET, regions where LPA showed higher tau-PET SUVR than PCA expand from baseline to follow-up, particularly in the right temporal and left frontal lobes. On MRI, GM volume loss in the left temporal lobe becomes more severe in LPA relative to PCA from baseline to follow-up.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrates that longitudinal rates of change in neuroimaging metrics differ between PCA and LPA. PCA participants did not show faster rates of tau accumulation anywhere in the cortex compared to LPA participants. LPA participants had faster rates of tau accumulation in the occipital and right temporoparietal regions. As we hypothesized, PCA participants had faster rates of occipital atrophy than LPA, while LPA participants had faster rates of left temporal atrophy.

Faster rates of occipital atrophy in PCA were not unexpected given that the occipital lobe is typically more affected at baseline in PCA.4,12 However, surprisingly, this finding was evident only when rates of atrophy were measured with annualized grey matter log Jacobians. In contrast, we found evidence of greater rates of atrophy in left temporal regions in LPA compared to PCA, consistent with a previous study,30 only when using grey matter volumes. LPA had higher Jacobians in the left temporal lobe, but the statistical significance was weak. This discrepancy in our results warrants attention in the methods chosen to investigate grey matter volume longitudinal change on structural MRI.

We observed a striking divergence between atrophy and tau accumulation whereby the LPA cohort showed slower rates of atrophy in the occipital lobe, but faster rates of tau accumulation compared to PCA. LPA participants also showed faster rates of tau accumulation in the right temporal and parietal lobes compared to PCA. This regional pattern of tau accumulation in LPA is consistent with published data from us and others that suggests a time lag between tau accumulation and subsequent volume loss, with tau accumulation over time greatest in regions that are relatively unaffected by neurodegeneration.6,7 It is also consistent with recent findings that flortaucipir uptake may plateau or even decline in advanced neurodegeneration.29 While our data show that LPA participants accumulate tau at a faster rate than PCA participants, it is possible that we are capturing these two syndromes at a different stage in the disease. The LPA participants had a slightly shorter time from onset to baseline scan, suggesting that PCA participants in our cohort might have been past their peak rates of tau accumulation, showing faster rates of neurodegeneration instead. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that language deficits are probably noticed earlier and are more disruptive than mild visuospatial symptoms.4 If higher baseline tau levels in the occipital lobe in PCA participants might largely explain the fact that LPA participants accumulated tau faster in this lobe, the same explanation does not apply to the right temporoparietal regions, where PCA participants did not have more tau at baseline than LPA. In case of the right temporal lobe, it is likely that, in LPA, pathology spreads from the left side of the language network contralaterally over time.

Another potential explanation for the diffusely faster rates of tau accumulation in LPA comes from functional connectivity. Several studies suggested that pathological tau spreads across the brain from regions with high levels of pathology, called epicenters, through functional networks.31,32 More severe tau pathology in regions that are globally connected facilitates the spreading of the protein.33 At baseline, LPA participants have higher tau levels in the left fronto-parietal cortex relative to PCA participants, who instead have higher tau levels in the occipital cortex, part of the visual network. The fronto-parietal association cortex contains strongly globally connected ‘hub’ regions, while the visual cortex is weakly connected.33 In particular, the left frontal hub is a key region for supporting cognition.34 Therefore, PCA tau epicenters might be in regions of the brain that are segregated or not well functionally connected to other regions. Instead, LPA tau epicenters might be more widely connected to the rest of the brain. For instance, LPA participants have high levels of tau pathology in the left precuneus, part of the ventral default mode network; this might promote better tau propagation and therefore faster rates of accumulation over time. Both disrupted default mode network connectivity and lower network segregation, i.e., higher between-network and lower within-network connectivity, characterize Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, in the default mode network of AD patients, posterior connectivity decreases while posterior-to-anterior connectivity increases,35 which might facilitate the spreading of tau from the posterior part of the brain to the frontal lobe. These speculative interpretations of our findings will need to be verified with ad hoc analyses of network segregations in relation to tau pathology.

In an overlapping cohort, LPA participants were characterized by more rapid clinical decline than PCA.10 LPA participants had faster rates of decline over one year in naming, repetition, working memory and verbal episodic memory, compared to PCA participants, who instead showed faster rates of decline in visuoperceptual function.10 The fact that PCA participants had greater rates of decline in visuoperceptual tests10 fits with our finding of faster rates of occipital atrophy in this phenotype. However, the general faster rates of cognitive decline in LPA coupled with diffuse faster rates of tau accumulation strengthens the hypothesis that tau-PET uptake maps onto clinical decline better than atrophy on MRI9 and is predictive of cognition in atypical AD.36

Age had a negative effect on both rates of tau accumulation and atrophy, in line with previous findings across AD phenotypes of a disease that is more aggressive in younger patients.6,8,37,38 Higher global baseline tau uptake was moderately predictive of subsequent lower rates of tau accumulation across the brain, consistent with the hypothesis that tau can plateau and even decline during the disease.8 However, our model of rates of tau accumulation across all lobes was not designed specifically to explore the effect of baseline tau burden on subsequent changes, with the baseline global tau value included to regress out as much as possible differences in disease stage between the two phenotypes that were compared. In fact, we and others have reported that higher baseline tau is associated to lower rates of accumulation locally but also faster rates distally, in areas of the brain not yet affected by the disease.6,39 In contrast, both PCA and LPA participants experienced the highest rates of atrophy in the regions that were already heavily atrophied at baseline, namely the occipital lobe for PCA and the left temporal lobe for LPA, suggesting that, unlike tau burden, atrophy does not plateau.

Analyses to compare the differential effect of time on tau-PET uptake between PCA and LPA led to more significant differences when tau-PET SUVR were computed relative to a composite region (eroded supratentorial white matter, pons and whole cerebellum) with PVC, confirming findings from Schwarz et al.26 that this pipeline optimizes longitudinal discrimination. Tau-PET SUVR calculated relative to the cerebellar crus grey matter without PVC led to consistent albeit weaker results. Calculating SUVR relative to the composite reference region including white matter reduces noise because it is a large reference region, but it increases bias because white matter contains off-target signal of unknown origin.40 For change measures over a few years within a person, the effect of age is small. However, for cross-sectional analyses that compare baseline values across groups, the added bias of the white matter reference is large, and reducing noise is not helpful since effect sizes across groups are already large. This methodological caveat might explain why baseline tau had a stronger effect on rates of change when SUVR were calculated relative to the cerebellar crus.

The main strength of our study is the analysis of multimodal longitudinal imaging for two rare, atypical AD phenotypes. Another strength is that we used imaging pipelines that are optimized for longitudinal MRI and tau-PET. Limitations of our study include having analyzed only two atypical AD phenotypes, with differences in age and disease duration between them. Future studies that follow patients over the full disease course may help address this issue. However, we must stress that it is challenging to match two clinically different phenotypes for disease stage. Additionally, LPA participants experienced faster rates of tau accumulation than PCA, even though they were slightly older than PCA participants and age has a negative effect on tau accumulation. Future studies on larger cohorts will also help clarify the discrepancies we found between longitudinal rates of atrophy evaluated with grey matter volumes versus Jacobians.

In summary, temporal trajectories of abnormalities of tau-PET uptake and MRI grey matter differ between the visual and language atypical AD phenotypes. This warrants attention when tau-PET quantities are used to monitor AD disease progression and efficacy of treatments in clinical trials. Specific attention must be given to age and regional baseline tau burden of the participants. Our study also has implications for understanding disease spreading, strengthening the hypothesis that the initial site of tau accumulation impacts the future course of the disease. These results improve understanding of disease progression in these atypical AD phenotypes and how tau deposition and volume loss differentially spread through the brain. Considering the patterns of disease progression on MRI and tau-PET could be diagnostically useful to differentiate LPA from PCA, although these results will need to be validated in other cohorts and across different disease stages to inform clinical utility.

Highlights

The language variant of Alzheimer’s disease accumulates tau faster than the visual variant.

Each variant shows faster rates of atrophy than the other in its signature regions.

Age negatively influences rates of atrophy and tau accumulation in both variants.
