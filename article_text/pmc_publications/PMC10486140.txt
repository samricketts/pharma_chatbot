Festa and colleagues highlight underrecognized factors that may bias research, policy, and population health strategies predicated upon claims-based ascertainment of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias within the United States.


pmcAbsent effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD), measures to prevent incident disease, delay symptom onset, and prolong functional independence are paramount. Identifying effective preventive measures and care delivery models, in turn, requires improved information regarding modifiable risk factors and corresponding population-level interventions that may alter the trajectory of ADRD. In many countries, including the United States, administrative data offer a singular means of studying these relationships in large and representative populations.

Researchers in the United States have increasingly drawn on administrative diagnostic information from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS)—the major public payer for healthcare of the elderly—to ascertain ADRD status. For example, the often used CMS Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) definition of ADRD has underpinned recent public health research identifying air pollution as a potentially modifiable contributor to neurodegenerative disease.(1) The CMS-CCW definition has also been used in health services research to examine the effects of local healthcare access on ADRD-related outcomes.(2) Moreover, clinical research has applied this definition to ascertain ADRD among persons for whom this diagnosis has important prognostic and treatment-related implications for comorbid conditions, such as cancer.(3) Emerging applications of claims-based ADRD ascertainment now include drug-repurposing and pharmacogenomics.(4)

Some limitations of ADRD ascertainment using claims have been enumerated, including selection bias due to underdiagnosis within administrative data.(5) However, we argue that significant issues remain unaddressed, which may bias research, policy, and population health strategies predicated upon administrative data within the United States Medicare population. Below, we discuss potential sources of bias that researchers should consider when using diagnostic claims to ascertain ADRD status. Our illustrative examples are focused within the United States Medicare program due to the proliferation of research measuring ADRD within this population. Many of the considerations that we outline, however, are universally applicable to research predicated upon claims-based ADRD ascertainment.

Limitations to Current Measurement Approaches

Misclassification by dementia-related diagnostic claims

Despite their utility, diagnoses recorded within administrative data for ADRD are not coterminous with clinical disease, and, instead, reflect clinical and administrative conventions across healthcare settings. ADRD is underdiagnosed and its ascertainment appears to be a nonrandom function of hierarchical factors that range from the level of the patient and family to that of the healthcare ecosystem.(6,7) These factors attenuate the alignment of diagnostic claims with clinical disease by influencing the probability of presenting to care, the extent of clinical evaluation and documentation, and the likelihood that ADRD diagnoses are coded within insurance claims.

Patient and caregiver factors, including awareness of cognitive changes and familial support, affect the likelihood that symptoms are reported to healthcare providers.(6,7) Clinician factors include variable practices with respect to cognitive evaluation and documentation.(8) Clinicians may choose not to screen for or attend to ADRD due to competing considerations (e.g., patient prognosis, time constraints) or perceived lack of benefit, given the absence of effective treatments or robust evidence to support early detection.(9) Clinicians’ specialty training and experience may also influence their level of attention to cognitive symptoms and signs, their command of diagnostic guidelines, and confidence in their interpretation and documentation of cognitive assessments.(10) Poor healthcare access or fragmented delivery further reduce the likelihood of proper diagnosis.(6,7)

Despite the importance of mechanistic linkages between exposures or interventions and neuropathology to causal inference, there are associated uncertainties that researchers should consider. First, even when diagnostic claims are well-aligned with clinical diagnoses, the latter may not always be tightly linked to neuropathology. For multiple dementia subtypes, clinical manifestations can be decoupled from biological or neuropathological indicators of disease.(11,12) Second, because neuropathology and biological markers differ across dementia subtypes,(13) putative exposure-response mechanisms may also differ across distinct or mixed presentations. Third, because dementia diagnosis occurs along a continuum and follows an extended prodromal phase, including mild cognitive impairment, (14) there is significant potential for clinical diagnoses (and subsequent administrative claims) to be temporally misaligned with disease onset.

The potential for differential selection and follow-up in the populations from which claims are sourced is a further issue. For example, it is common for large-scale studies evaluating the relationship between air quality and dementia to utilize claims from Traditional Medicare — the original publicly financed fee-for-service insurance program for older and disabled persons in the United States. But around half of older adults are now in the alternative Medicare Advantage program, which enables commercial health insurers to offer privatized benefits that are reimbursed on a capitated basis through Medicare.(15) Because encounter data from the Medicare Advantage program have only recently become available, most ADRD-focused research has used claims from beneficiaries in Traditional Medicare.(16) Early evidence suggests that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries with ADRD may nonrandomly switch into Traditional Medicare in a manner that corresponds to disease severity.(17) Because plan switching may not occur until cognitive and functional impairments are overt, estimates of ADRD incidence that are generalized from Traditional Medicare to the United States population may be upwardly biased.

The composition- and context-dependent accuracy of claims-based definitions

Multiple factors affect the accuracy with which claims-based definitions ascertain clinical ADRD.(18) The commonly used CMS-CCW definition contains diagnostic codes that are either noncognitive or clinically distinct from dementia.(18) Prominent among these are diagnostic codes for delirium or general physical debility; although these are frequent comorbidities in persons with ADRD, they are not indicative of ADRD, and thus represent a common reason for false-positive ascertainment.(18) For example, delirium is a distinct neuropsychiatric syndrome that may be precipitated by stressors, including medical procedures or acute illness, in persons with or without underlying ADRD.(18,19) Accordingly, it is difficult, if not incongruent with diagnostic standards, for clinicians to diagnose ADRD during hospital encounters, wherein it may be impossible to discern or address all reversible contributors to impaired cognition. Researchers should, therefore, remain vigilant for factors that predispose claims-based ADRD definitions to capture reversible neuropsychiatric complications or noncognitive manifestations of aging, rather than true neurodegenerative disease.

The accuracy of ADRD diagnoses also varies across healthcare settings and levels.(18) Nonetheless, some studies utilize Medicare claims solely from hospital encounters, which select for sicker individuals, whose comorbidities may have complex interactions with dementia.(5) The corresponding potential for reverse causation and biased ascertainment deserves particular attention in persons with intensive healthcare utilization. As has been noted in prior critiques of environmental epidemiological studies of ADRD, rates of underdiagnosis are substantial and may not be independent of exposure to air pollution.(5) For instance, persons with exposure to poor air quality may have a higher comorbidity burden that increases their frequency of contact with the healthcare system. Greater contact with the healthcare system is expected to increase the likelihood of obtaining a clinical dementia diagnosis and subsequent documentation within administrative claims, whether an accurate or false positive diagnosis due to the potential conflation of nonspecific or noncognitive presentations with true neurodegenerative disease.(5,18)

The likelihood that a hospitalized patient is assigned an ADRD-related claim may vary according to illness type and severity, as well as the presence of potentially confounding iatrogenic complications, such as physical deconditioning or neuropsychiatric symptoms. These setting-dependent factors can, therefore, increase the presence of problematic diagnostic codes within claims-based ADRD definitions, as described above. This may explain why the CMS-CCW definition does not appear to classify ADRD any better than chance among Medicare beneficiaries whose qualifying ADRD-related claims were solely assigned during inpatient encounters.(18)

It is also important to consider that claims-based definitions of ADRD are often validated against information within the electronic health record, which is subject to similar sources of information bias.(20) As with administrative claims, hierarchical factors at the level of the patient, provider, and insurer influence the likelihood that cognitive symptoms and assessments are documented.(21) This results in the common validation of claims-based ADRD definitions against reference standards that may nonrandomly misclassify clinical status.(21) Therefore, the performance characteristics of clams-based ADRD definitions should be interpreted in the context of reference standard limitations and researchers should acknowledge and address the direction and impact of bias pertinent to their research question.

Accounting for time-varying incentives

Although longitudinal studies usually account for numerous time-varying factors when using administrative data to ascertain incident ADRD, they rarely address changes in incentives that influence diagnostic and administrative practices. One major factor includes varying reimbursement incentives, which have occurred in the United States Medicare population.(22) Enhancing the reimbursement tied to ADRD would be expected to increase incident and prevalent cases within administrative data.(21) Two such changes occurred in 2014 and 2020 when CMS first eliminated additional financial reimbursement for beneficiaries with both complicated and uncomplicated dementias and then reintroduced it.(23) The 2020 policy change created an incentive to heighten diagnostic coding intensity for ADRD because it increases prospective insurance payments for the majority of Medicare beneficiaries, who are either enrolled in provider organizations that contract with Traditional Medicare (Accountable Care Organizations) or insured through Medicare Advantage. Changes to reimbursement policy should, therefore, be addressed as potential confounders in longitudinal research using claims-based ADRD ascertainment.

In addition to policy changes that increase risk-adjusted reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries with qualifying ADRD claims, there are time-varying financial incentives specific to inpatient healthcare encounters. In 2012, CMS incorporated dementia diagnosis codes within its bundled Diagnosis Related Group reimbursement classification system for hospital encounters, something especially relevant to data and studies that utilize only inpatient episodes to ascertain ADRD.(24)

Recommendations to Improve ADRD Ascertainment

The use of administrative data to identify ADRD has important and promising applications. These include the ability to research the effects of many factors, ranging from population health management strategies to environmental exposures, on outcomes for persons with ADRD within large and representative populations of older adults. Addressing factors that enhance the accuracy of claims-based ADRD ascertainment is important to future research and ensuing clinical or policy decisions that are predicated upon these measures. Because claims-based definitions of ADRD may be uniquely bias-prone, researchers should maintain vigilance when using these instruments within administrative data. In the presence of varying clinical and administrative conventions and incentives, the calibration of diagnostic claims to true ADRD requires continued evaluation and the relationship of potential biases to the research question of interest should be carefully considered.

We have six recommendations to address the limitations of claims-based ADRD ascertainment. First, we propose incorporating metadata, especially the healthcare setting in which claims were assigned, into claims-based definitions. Incorporating metadata can address and attenuate setting-specific changes in the accuracy of ADRD-related diagnosis codes.(18) For example, researchers could test alternative claims-based ADRD definitions that require qualifying claims from two or more healthcare settings or distinct encounters. Second, we suggest removing nonspecific and noncognitive diagnoses from claims-based ADRD definitions. Third, we encourage explicit accounting for time-varying administrative and financial incentives on case ascertainment. For studies involving Medicare beneficiaries, this should include policy changes that may directly or indirectly influence ADRD ascertainment and corresponding clinical and administrative documentation. Fourth, we encourage explicit consideration of ADRD underdiagnosis, as well as emerging evidence of nonrandom plan switching among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD as sources of bias.(7,17) Fifth, we encourage researchers to explicitly consider and discuss the relationship between their hypotheses and the expected direction and magnitude of biases introduced through claims-based ADRD ascertainment. Lastly, while we have drawn upon examples within the United States, similar issues obtain in ADRD research using administrative data from other healthcare systems. We encourage comparing the accuracy of ADRD ascertainment across health systems and large datasets.
