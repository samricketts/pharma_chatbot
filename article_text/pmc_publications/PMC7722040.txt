Cerebrovascular disease is a common comorbidity in older adults, typically assessed in terms of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI. While it is well known that WMHs exacerbate cognitive symptoms, the exact relation of WMHs with cognitive performance and other degenerative diseases is unknown. Furthermore, based on location, WMHs are often classified into periventricular and deep WMHs and are believed to have different pathological origins. Whether the two types of WMHs influence cognition differently is unclear. Using regression models, we assessed the independent association of these two types of WMHs with cognitive performance in two separate studies focused on distinct degenerative diseases, early Alzheimer’s (mild cognitive impairment), and Parkinson’s disease. We further tested if the two types of WMHs were differentially associated with reduced cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by arterial spin labeling and increased mean diffusivity (MD, a marker of tissue injury) as measured by diffusion imaging. Our approach revealed that both deep and periventricular WMHs were associated with poor performance on tests of global cognition (Montreal cognitive Assessment, MoCA), task processing (Trail making test), and category fluency in the study of mild cognitive impairment. They were associated with poor performance in global cognition (MoCA) and category fluency in the Parkinson’s disease study. Of note, more associations were detected between cognitive performance and deep WMHs than between cognitive performance and periventricular WMHs. Mechanistically, both deep and periventricular WMHs were associated with increased MD. Both deep and periventricular WMHs were also associated with reduced CBF in the gray matter.

white matter hyperintensities

Introduction

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are the most accessible and commonly used markers of small-vessel pathology in individuals with cardiovascular and symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. They can be measured noninvasively using simple T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. Specifically, in neurodegenerative diseases, and especially in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), WMH burden is well correlated with poor performance on cognitive measures. In cerebral amyloid angiopathy, WMHs are associated with intravascular deposition of amyloid peptide (Aβ40). They predict the progression of cognitive impairment and hence, are a potential marker of evolving vascular pathology. Vascular disease pathology increases with age and is a common comorbidity in multiple disorders. However, the etiology and the role of WMH in common degenerative diseases, such as AD itself, or Parkinson’s disease (PD), is poorly understood.

The pathologies underlying WMHs include venous collagenosis, vascular insufficiency, myelin rarefaction, and axonal loss. Pathologic studies show that chronic hypoperfusion and plasma leakage due to blood-brain barrier breakdown can cause WMHs in the deep white matter tissue.1–3 Neuropathological assessment of older adult controls and individuals with depression showed that most large WMHs were ischemic in both groups and were frequent in the frontal cortex, but punctate (small) WMH in controls had nonischemic origins as well.4 WMHs have also been associated with cardiovascular disease.2,5 Promjunyakul et al showed that cerebral perfusion in the immediate vicinity of WMH was significantly reduced compared to distant tissue and was at risk of infarction and conversion to a WMH within 18 months.6 Not only perfusion, but the cerebrovascular reserve is depleted in the penumbral regions of WMH. The decline in reserve is more severe than the decline in perfusion.7 WMH severity is also related to a reduction in diffusion parameters of axonal integrity, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within the WMHs. A recent study found that the FA values are lower in the periventricular WMHs than in the deep WMH, suggesting the presence of different mechanistic contributions to WMHs based on location.8

The role of WMH in other degenerative diseases, such as PD, Lewy body disease, and frontotemporal lobar dementia, is unclear and poorly studied. Only one study has so far compared the WMH burden among patients with dementia due to AD, PD, and Lewy body disease.9 Burton et al found a significantly higher WMH burden in AD but not in PD or Lewy body disease. A study in de novo PD subjects with cognitive impairment found a higher WMH burden and higher cortical thinning than healthy subjects.10

In this work, we evaluate the burden and spatial distribution (periventricular vs. deep) of WMH in participants from two studies, the University of Washington’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Pacific Udall Center. We further tested whether periventricular and deep WMH uniquely contributed to cognitive symptoms in the two studies. We also determined whether vascular insufficiency (measured using arterial spin labeling) or white matter disruption (measured using diffusion imaging) was closely associated with WMHs.

Methods

Demographic Information

One hundred and fifty-two older adults were recruited from the University of Washington Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and the Pacific Udall Center of Excellence in Parkinson’s Disease Research (PUC) and imaged with the approval of the institutional review board. From the ADRC, 78 individuals were imaged, of which 33 (14F, 76 ± 9 years) were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 45 were control participants with normal cognition (ADRCNC, 16F, 77 ± 8 years).11 Of the 72 individuals from PUC, 44 were diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD; 31F, 72 ± 9 years), and 28 were control participants without any PD symptoms (PUCNC, 16F, 72 ± 9) during diagnostic consensus conferences that included study neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and other study clinicians.12,13 Eleven PUCNC and 26 PD participants were diagnosed with MCI. Cognitive tests included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test B (TRAILS), Multilingual Naming Test (MINT), CRAFT immediate, and delayed recall (CRAFTi and CRAFTd), Vegetable and Animal Category Fluency (CATFLU), Number Span and Verbal Fluency in the ADRC.14–17 The PUC cognitive battery involved MoCA, TRAILS, Boston Naming Test (BNT), Logical Memory immediate and delayed recall (LMi and LMd), and Animal CATFLU. Table 1 outlines the demographic information for this study. Additionally, it also included Letter Number Sequencing Test, Digit Span, Judgement of Line Orientation, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, Stroop test, and phonemic verbal fluency. Severity of motor symptoms was associated with Movement Disorders Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).18,19

MoCA, TRAILS, and CATFLU are common across the ADRC and PUC studies. Boston Naming Test (BNT) and MINT are considered equivalent based on the Crosswalk Study in 935 individuals across 24 AD Centers in the United States (Spearman correlations for the correct trials in the forward and backward trials = .75 and .78, respectively). Similarly, CRAFT and LM are equivalent. Spearman correlations for the correct trials in the MINT/BNT and CRAFT/LM studies = .76 and .73 (immediate)/.77(delayed), respectively.20 Therefore, these five tests that were similar across the two studies were considered for further analyses. Due to the significant difference in age and categorization of control participants in the two studies (for instance, inclusion of individuals with cognitive impairment in the control group of PUC), analyses associated with cognitive tests were conducted separately for each study. For the mechanistic question regarding the physiological drivers of WMH, data from both studies were combined. We tested whether periventricular white matter hyperintensities (PVWMHs) and deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs) were associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and MD.

Both studies were performed at the same site on the same scanner with identical hardware and acquisition protocols eliminating any systematic intersite or interstudy bias.

MRI Acquisition

All scans were performed on a 3T Philips Achieva scanner with 32 channel SENsitivity Encoding (SENSE) reception using identical imaging parameters. T1 images were acquired using a 3D-Turbo Field Echo (TFE) acquisition with TR/TE = 8/8/4.3 milliseconds, resolution = .8 × .8 × .8 mm3, and total acquisition time = 8:13 minutes, for image registration and segmentation purposes. To characterize WMH, FLAIR images were acquired using: TR/TI/TE = 5,000/1,600/294 milliseconds, resolution = .8 × .8 × .8 mm3, matrix size = 208 × 240 × 256, and total acquisition time = 8:01 minutes.

Gray matter CBF was quantified using a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) imaging parameters, which were: TR/TE = 5000/19 milliseconds, SENSE factor = 2.3, 30 pairs of control and label images, resolution = 3.5 × 3.5 × 5 mm3, 20 slices, TR = 5,000 milliseconds, TE = 19 milliseconds, background suppression (BS1 = 2,050 milliseconds, BS2, 3,400 milliseconds), label plane 80 mm below the center of the imaging volume, and total acquisition time = 4:39 minutes. A long labeling τ = 1,800 milliseconds per the recommendation by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) for imaging older adults with and without vascular pathology was used.21 The post labeling delay, ω, = 2,000 milliseconds. A 1-minute reference M0 image was subsequently acquired with identical parameters in the absence of labeling with TR = 10,000 milliseconds and five averages to allow for quantification of CBF values.

To quantify white matter integrity, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (data acquisition time = 12:22 minutes) using 64 directions, TR/TE = 8,300/88 milliseconds, 4 b = 0 s/mm2 images each in the anterior (blip A) and posterior (blip P) directions to correct for field distortions related to echo planar imaging readouts, resolution = 1.75 × 1.75 × 1.75 mm3, 66 slices, SENSE factor = = 2, b-value = 2,000 s/mm2, half scan factor = .62, fat suppression with SPIR.

Analyses

The T1-weighted images were segmented into white matter, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and ventricles using FreeSurfer v5.1.22 The total intracranial volume (eTIV) was also calculated. This process also generated a ventricular mask. The ventricular mask was visually checked for inaccuracies (inclusion of other tissue types or incomplete segmentation) before proceeding. No manual corrections were needed for ventricular masks. In order to define a periventricular region, the ventricular mask was dilated by 10 mm. All remaining white matter was considered “deep white matter.”

Since the anatomical T1 and FLAIR data were acquired at a higher resolution (.8 mm3 isotropic) than the ASL (3.5 × 3.5 × 5 mm3) and DTI data (1.75 mm3 isotropic), all analysis was performed in the subject space for each imaging approach. The FLAIR images were segmented into a binarized mask of WMH using the FLeX tool.23 WMHs were visually checked to ensure accurate segmentation. No manual corrections or adjustments were performed. However, in some cases, gray matter or choroid plexus in the ventricles was erroneously included. To exclude these erroneous segmentations, the WMH mask was multiplied by the binary white matter tissue mask obtained from FreeSurfer. Visual confirmation of accurate WMH masks was obtained. The deep and periventricular white matter masks were applied to identify deep WMH and periventricular WMH, respectively. The deep WMH burden was calculated by normalizing the number of voxels of deep WMH by the total number of tissue voxels in deep white matter. Analogous calculations were performed for periventricular burdens.

In order to calculate CBF maps, the best practices outlined by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM), the Quality Evaluation Index (QEI) defined by Dolui et al,24 and registration modifications suggested for the GENetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative(GENFI) cohort were applied.25 Briefly, the control and label images were first registered to the first control image using a modified realignment routine in SPM to account for the intensity fluctuations inherent to the pCASL acquisition using the ASLtbx software package.26 Then, the registered control and label images were further linearly registered to the M0 image. Difference images (ΔM) were composed by subtracting the control and label pairs and averaged together. CBF maps were computed using the ISMRM guidelines of 2015. All negative values were then set to 0. Subject-specific gray matter probability masks (obtained from FSL-FAST) were used to adjust for partial volume effects and correct CBF values in the gray matter tissue. The gray matter masks from the T1 space were linearly registered to the perfusion space. For this purpose, first, M0 image was registered to T1, and an inverse transformation was applied. No CBF measurements were made in white matter due to the inaccuracy of ASL in doing so.

We indexed white matter integrity using MD that was calculated in FSL 5.0.27 First, the Blip A and P acquisitions were used with FSL’s topup and eddy to minimize field distortion. Distortion correction was followed by motion correction using mcflirt. Note that motion correction is typically also performed automatically during the distortion correction and is not always necessary. dtifit was used then to fit a tensor model and calculate MD. A high b-value of 2,000 s/mm2 may not result in accurate values of FA with a linear tensor model due to the nonlinear behavior of diffusion in this regime. Therefore, we used MD as a marker of white matter integrity in our work. MD values were computed in the white matter. Similar to CBF computations, tissue masks from the T1 space were registered to the diffusion space. For this purpose, first, the b = 0 s/mm2 image was registered to T1, and an inverse transformation was applied to linearly register the white matter masks into diffusion space.

Statistical Analysis

Continuous and ordinal measurements were summarized as median (inter-quartile range, IQR) due to the heteroscedastic distribution of data. All analyses utilized multivariable regression models. To minimize right skewness, imaging variables were log-transformed. All variables were further standardized (by subtracting the mean and dividing by the std. deviation) before further analyses. Hence, no units are shown in the figures and tables.

First, periventricular and deep WMH burdens were compared between groups (MCI vs. ADRCNC and PD vs. PUCNC) using linear regression models with adjustments of age, sex, and eTIV. Before evaluating the association between cognitive tests and periventricular and deep WMH, we determined whether the deep and periventricular WMH variables were significantly correlated and posed a multicollinearity problem, ie, the two variables (periventricular and deep WMH burden) are not independent. They then would not uniquely explain the outcome (cognitive performance). To quantify for multicollinearity, we estimated the variance inflation factor (VIF) for our data. If VIF &gt;5, indicating multicollinearity, only one of the two WMH burdens would be included in the regression model.28,29 Otherwise, both deep and periventricular WMH were included in the regression models.

The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model was applied to study the association of cognitive tests with periventricular and deep WMH burden. LASSO is a regularization approach for linear regression that applies a constraint on the regression coefficient estimates. This constraint tends to reduce overfitting and leads to simultaneous variable selection as the constraint can lead to coefficient estimates, which are exactly zero (ie, zero impact on the model prediction). The full model was (1) Test ~ Age + Sex + PVWMH + DWMH + eTIV 

where Test = MoCA, TRAILS, CRAFTi, CRAFTd, MINT, and CATFLU for the ADRC participants, and MoCA, TRAILS, LMi, LMd, BNT, and CATFLU for the PUC participants. PVWMH = Periventricular WMH burden 

DWMH = Deep WMH burden 

The LASSO regularization parameter, λ, was selected for each model to minimize its prediction error estimated using five-fold cross-validation. Using the optimized values of λ, variables with nonzero regression coefficients were identified. If PVWMH or DWMH were identified, scatter plots showing the association between the cognitive test and PVWMH and/or DWMH were plotted. No significance or correlation is shown since the plots are a result of this regression analysis and, therefore, strictly for visualization. They are not a redundant correlation plot.

A similar model was applied to determine if periventricular and deep WMH were associated with impaired gray matter perfusion and diffuse white matter tissue injury. The full model in this case was PVWMH or DWMH ~ Age + Sex + MD

(2) CBF+MCI+ADRCNC+PUCNC

where MCI and ADRCNC and PUCNC are categorical variables determining group status. The group variables were one-hot en coded to allow inclusion in a LASSO regression. eTIV was not included for these analyses for the mechanistic question being considered here.

Results

For the final analyses, cognitive scores were unavailable in six individuals. Therefore, all analyses were calculated on 144 individuals, including 44 ADRCNC, 31 MCI, 28 PUCNC, and 41 PD participants. For the analyses involving TRAILS, 15 individuals did not have TRAILS scores. One hundred and thirty-five individuals were included in these analyses with 38 ADRCNC, 26 MCI, 28 PUCNC, and 43 PD participants. Table 2 outlines the summary statistics for all imaging measurements utilized in this study. As described in the Demographics section, there was a significant difference in age and categorization of control participants in the two studies. Therefore, comparisons involving cognitive assessment were made separately between controls and individuals with MCI from the ADRC and between controls and PD participants from PUC.

Figure 1A shows the corresponding images for each modality and violin plots. The top row shows periventricular WMHs in yellow and deep WMHs in blue for one individual. Corresponding maps of MD and CBF are shown in subsequent rows. Figure 1B clearly shows the skewed distribution of the imaging measurements.

Multicollinearity analyses revealed that in the ADRC sample, the PVWMH and DWMH were highly correlated (r = .76), while the correlation was much weaker in the PUC sample (r = .43). Using the full model from Equation 1, the VIFs for the PWMH and DWMH variables in the ADRC dataset were 3.10 and 3.24, respectively. By contrast, the VIFs for the PUC dataset were 1.41 and 1.52, well below the threshold we used to define multicollinearity, VIF ≥ 5.29,30 Consequently, although well correlated, both PVWM and DWMH do not meet the criteria for multicollinearity and uniquely explain variance in the data. Both PVWMH and DWMH were, therefore, included in all further regression analyses.

Using Equation 1, we tested whether PVWMH and DWMH were differentially associated with cognitive measures. Table 3 shows the regression outcome in the ADRC and PUC data, respectively, ie, all variables were selected by the LASSO algorithm (have significant nonzero regression coefficients). Figure 2 shows the scatter plot showing significant associations between PVWMH and/or DWMH and cognitive tests identified by the LASSO and depicted in Table 3. Poor performance on MoCA, TRAILS, and CATFLU was significantly associated with a higher burden of deep WMHs in the ADRC. Only poor performance on MoCA and TRAILS was associated with PVWMH. From the plots for multivariate regressions, the LASSO coefficient for the association of PVWMH with MoCA was positive (.04), while correlation was negative (Pearson’s r = −.01). Similarly, the LASSO coefficient for the association of PVWMH with TRAILS was negative (−.04), while correlation was positive (Pearson’s r = .20). This phenomenon is called Simpson’s Paradox, which occurs when a trend or association occurs at every value of the categorical-dependent variable but disappears when the categorical variable (the ADRCNC and MCI groups in this case shown by ◇ and +, respectively) is not considered. The fit for ADRCNC is shown in green and the fit for MCI group is shown in red. The black line shows the LASSO fit without including the group categorical variable based on Equation 1. Fewer associations were discovered in the PUC study. Poor performance on the MoCA and CATFLU was associated with a higher deep WMH burden in this sample. Only low CATFLU scores were detected with a higher PVWMH burden.

Using Equation 2, we tested whether PVWMH and DWMH were associated with CBF or MD. Both WMHs were associated with age, sex, MD, CBF, and group status, as shown in Table 4. Figure 3 shows the associations of PVWMH and DWMH with MD and CBF. Higher MD (more diffuse white matter disruption) was significantly associated with higher PVWMH and DWMH burden. Lower CBF was also significantly associated with higher PVWMH and DWMH.

Discussion

Our study shows that (i) PVWMH and DWMH burden, while correlated, each explains some unique variance components in the data. (ii) PVWMH, and more prominently, DWMH burden are significantly associated with cognitive performance and more so in the ADRC than the PUC sample. (iii) Both PVWMH and DWMH were associated with diffuse white matter injury and cortical hypoperfusion, as measured by MD and CBF, respectively.

WMH burden is known to increase in older adults and correlates well with cognitive performance, especially global cognition and task processing functions, especially in AD. In our study, we found significant associations between WMH burden and MoCA, and TRAILS as well as category fluency tests. Poor performance on the MoCA and TRAILS was associated with both WMHs in the ADRC sample. Significant associations were also observed between CATFLU scores and DWMH. No significant associations were detected with MINT or CRAFT scores. There is no clear evidence linking only PVWMH or DWMH to cognitive decline. In the elderly population at risk of AD, one study reported that only baseline periventricular WMHs were associated with cognitive decline.31 At the same time, others found that baseline deep WMHs, along with medial temporal atrophy, predict the conversion from MCI to AD.32,33 Similarly, Silbert et al showed that periventricular WMH progression was associated with changes in gait stability in older adults in 13 years.34 The same study showed that the progression of deep WMHs was associated with memory decline.

Our study found associations between DWMH burden and MoCA and CATFLU in the PUC sample. PD subjects are known to have impaired semantic verbal fluency. WMH burden has been associated with worse motor (UPDRS and gait) and cognitive (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) symptoms in PD.35,36 PD individuals with higher WMH burden had a higher rate of disease progression with a greater severity of motor symptoms. No associations were detected with BNT, TRAILS, and logical memory scores in our study. Most studies have not investigated the association of cognitive tests used in this work and WMHs in PD. One study found that WMH burden was associated with TRAILS in young PD participants (50–69 years of age) but not in older participants (&gt;69 years of age) and concluded that task-processing tests, such as TRAILS, may be most sensitive in young PD participants.37

Overall, the WMH burden and distribution were similar in controls, AD, and PD, the burden being slightly lower in the PUC participants. The participants were significantly younger than the ADRC participants and may explain the lack of association between WMH burden and cognitive decline. Additionally, almost 40% of the PD participants and PUC controls had no cognitive impairment.

CBF and MD were both associated with DWMH and PVWMH (Fig 3). Previous studies have shown reduced CBF in the vicinity of WMHs.6,7 Studies also show decreased cortical CBF in subjects with a higher WMH burden.38,39 A similar outcome has been observed for MD. High MD in normal-appearing white matter is the most sensitive marker of WMH severity. Injury in the association areas could potentially affect the periventricular and deep regions by Wallerian degeneration.40 Finally, late myelinating fibers may be more vulnerable to white matter damage in degenerative diseases and may result in WMH formation.41 Mechanistically, we did not find a difference between DWMH and PVWMH. One reason for this could be the presence of confluent WMHS, ie, periventricular WMH extending and joining into deep WMHs. Periventricular and deep WMHs classification is still somewhat arbitrary. Future investigations could involve identifying only punctate WMH as DWMH and categorizing the confluent WMHs as a separate WMH subtype. Identification of confluent WMHs would require manual demarcation of WMHs or a 3D representation and sophisticated segmentation techniques to identify confluent WMHs and nonconfluent deep WMHs.42 In doing so, the discrepancies in understanding whether deep or periventricular or both types of WMHs are associated with cognitive performance may also be resolved.

In conclusion, we investigated the association of WMH and their spatial distribution with cognitive functioning in two distinct diseases. Overall, the WMH burden and distribution were similar in controls, AD, and PD. We found more associations between DWMH and cognition than PVWMH and cognition. Both PVWMH and DWMH are associated with reduced cortical CBF and increased MD.

No significant differences were observed.

Fig 2. (A) Plots showing the association of cognitive scores and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) in green and Pacific Udall Center (PUC) in purple. Poor performance on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Category fluency (CATFLU), and longer processing times on Trail Making Test B (TRAILS) was associated with greater burden of deep WMHs in the ADRC. Similar association was detected between MoCA and periventricular WMH in the ADRC. From the plots for multivariate regressions, the coefficient for the association of periventricular WMHs with MoCA was positive (.04), while correlation was negative (Pearson’s r = −.01). Similarly, the coefficient for the association of periventricular WMHs with TRAILS was negative (−.04), while correlation was positive (Pearson’s r = .20). This phenomenon is called Simpson’s Paradox (ie, positive regression coefficient depicted by the black line with a positive slope for MoCA but negative correlation within each group, cognitively normal participants from the ADRC, ADRCNC: green fit with individual data point represented by ◇ and mild cognitive impairment, MCI: red fit and individual data point represented by +). (B) In the PUC study, deep WMH burden was associated with poor performance in MoCA and CATFLU. Periventricular WMHs were associated with only CATFLU. Note that all axes show log normalized measurements. Despite the high correlation, deep and periventricular WMHs have low collinearity and hence contribute independently to cognitive scores. No correlations, confidence intervals, and P values are shown since these plots reflect outcome of the lasso regression model. All scales are log normalized.

Values are median [Interquartile Range].

MCI = mild cognitive impairment; ADRCNC = cognitively normal controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center; PD = Parkinson’s disease participants; PUCNC = normal controls (unaffected by PD symptoms) from the Pacific Udall center; PVWMH = periventricular white matter hyperintensity burden; DWMH = deep white matter hyperintensity burden; CBF = cerebral blood flow; MD = mean diffusivity.

Since PVWMH and DWMH is a ratio of WMH volume to intracranial volume, it has no units.
