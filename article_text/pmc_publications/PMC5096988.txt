The cis/trans isomerization of X-Pro peptide bonds in proteins in some instances acts as a molecular switch in biological pathways. Our prior work suggests that the cis isomer of the phospho-Thr668-Pro669 motif, located in the cytoplasmic domain of the amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP), is correlated with an increase in amyloidogenic processing of AβPP and production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the neurotoxic peptide fragment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We designed a 100% cis-locked cyclic dipeptide composed of cyclized phospho-Thr-Pro (pCDP) as a mimic for this putative pathological conformation, and three phosphate-blocked derivatives (pCDP-diBzl, pCDP-Bzl, and pCDP-diPOM). Two H4 neuroglioma cell lines were established as AD cell models for use in testing these compounds: H4-AβPP695 for stable overexpression of wild-type AβPP695, and H4-BACE1 for stable overexpression of β-site AβPP Cleaving Enzyme-1 (BACE1). The level of the secreted AβPP fragment resulting from BACE1 activity, sAβPPβ, served as a key proxy for amyloidogenic processing, since cleavage of AβPP by BACE1 is a requisite first step in Aβ production. Of the compounds tested, pCDP-diBzl decreased sAβPPβ levels in both cell lines, while pCDP-diPOM decreased sAβPPβ levels in only H4-BACE1 cells, all with similar dose-dependences and patterns of proteolytic AβPP fragments. Enzymatic assays showed that none of the pCDP derivatives directly inhibit BACE1 catalytic activity. These results suggest a model in which pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM act at a common point to inhibit entry of AβPP into the amyloidogenic AβPP processing pathway but through different targets, and provide important insights for the development of novel AD therapeutics. Keywords: Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor, Alzheimer’s Disease, cyclic dipeptides, diketopiperazine, phosphorylated Thr668.


INTRODUCTION

Cyclic dipeptides (CDPs) are 2,5-diketopiperazine structures that are naturally abundant across all organisms, including mammals [1–4]. The core CDP structure, with backbone hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, can easily bind to catalytic and regulatory sites within enzymes [4]. CDPs can be synthesized under physiological conditions using mild acid or base chemistry [4–5], which is the process by which cyclic-His-Pro is produced in mammalian nervous systems [6]. Specific CDPs act as kinase antagonists [7], chitinase inhibitors [8], cancer drugs that cause apoptosis and growth inhibition of HT-29 colon cancer tumor cells [9], and neuroprotective agents in rats with impaired motor and cognitive abilities [10]. Although the exact mechanism of action for these neuroprotective CDPs is not well understood, there is evidence suggests that increased astrocyte activity, decreased caspase-3, or reduced of microglial reactivity could explain the neuroprotective properties of certain CDPs [reviewed in 3]. CDPs are generally small (&lt;500 Da) and can diffuse through membranes, the blood brain barrier (BBB), and can often be taken up by peptide transporters [4]. Despite their reported neuroprotective effects, the extent to which CDPs affect the production of Aβ peptide, the neurotoxic peptide fragment upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, has not been tested.

The amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) is involved in a variety of cellular processes connected to the pathogenesis of AD [11]. AβPP is a type 1 transmembrane protein composed of a large N-terminal extracellular domain, a single α-helix transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (Figure 1A) [12]. AβPP is proteolytically cleaved in vivo in two ways by the cell (reviewed in 13), depending on its cellular localization. At the plasma membrane, AβPP is dominantly processed via the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Here, α secretases constitutively cleave AβPP into sAβPPα and C83 fragments [14]. C83 is further cleaved by γ secretase producing p3 and AβPP intracellular domain (AICD). Alternatively, in the amyloidogenic pathway AβPP can be internalized and localized to endosomes, where β secretase (β site AβPP cleaving enzyme 1, or BACE1) cleaves AβPP to produce sAβPPβ and C99 fragments [15], followed by γ secretase cleavage of C99 to produce neurotoxic Aβ peptide and AICD (Figure 1A).

The innate balance between nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic AβPP processing can be shifted by a number of factors. Cleavage of AβPP by BACE1 is enhanced by elevated BACE1 expression [16], by elevated AβPP gene dosage as occurs in trisomy 21 individuals [17–18], by familial AβPP mutations [19], and by cholesterol enrichment in membrane invaginations (reviewed in 20). Conversely, a BACE1 cleavage site mutation in AβPP identified in an Icelandic population has been found to be protective against AD [21]. In cells, this mutation reduces BACE1-mediated AβPP cleavage and shifts AβPP processing away from the amyloidogenic route [21]. Other genetic changes that protect against AD include the E2 allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) [22,23], and the BACE1-knockout, which has been shown to abolish AD pathology in mice [24]. Clearly, the regulation of AβPP processing is complex, and the development of chemical probes that alter AβPP processing could serve as useful tools for the development of strategies to prevent and/or treat AD.

Within the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP (AβPPc), the level of phosphorylation of the Thr668-Pro669 (TP) motif (Figure 1B) is increased in the AD brains [25], and may be an important signaling motif that becomes dysregulated in the development of AD [25–27]. Prior to phosphorylation, the trans-isomer of the TP peptide bond is stabilized by the formation of a helix-capping box structure [28] (Figure 1A, pink box) and no cis-TP isomer is detected [29]. Only after phosphorylation is the helix-capping box destabilized (Figure 1B) and a cis-phosphorylated-TP (pTP) population emerges in ~10% abundance with the trans-pTP isomer in ~90% abundance [29]. The exchange between cis and trans isomers of the pTP peptide bond is very slow [30], and is accelerated by ~2000 fold by the enzyme Pin1 [31,32]. Additionally, brain tissue from Pin1 knockout mice show an increase in the phosphorylation of T668 in AβPP and in amyloidogenic AβPP processing (Figure 1A) [33]. Since pT668 accumulates in AD brains [25] and is required for formation of the cis-pTP isomer [29], the cis isomer might serve as a molecular signal for putative cellular binding proteins that localize AβPP to endosomes for β-secretase cleavage [33].

To test the importance of the cis-pTP conformation as a signal for AβPP processing, we synthesized a small molecule, phospho-Thr-Pro cyclic dipeptide (pCDP) (Figure 1C), that is a 100% “cis-locked” mimic of the cis-pTP motif in the AβPP cytoplasmic tail. Three additional pCDP derivatives with blocking groups on the phosphate moiety were generated to test delivery and activity of these molecules in cells (Figure 2). Two distinct H4 neuroglioma cell lines that stably overexpress either AβPP695 (H4-AβPP695) or BACE1 (H4-BACE1) were generated, providing AD cell models in which the effects of pCDP compounds on AβPP processing production were investigated. The secreted product of APP cleavage by BACE1, sAβPPβ, was used as a proxy for monitoring amyloidogenic processing. Testing of pCDPs in two comparative AD models revealed that, while both pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM inhibit amyloidogenic AβPP processing, they must act through different targets but at a similar point in the pathway. Together, these data suggest that pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM molecules provide intriguing tools for investigating the role of cis-pTP conformation in the proteolytic processing of AβPP, potentially leading to novel strategies for inhibiting the production of Aβ.

Positive clones were expanded and maintained in growth medium containing 200 µg/mL G418 until frozen.

Analysis of custom-synthesized compounds

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analysis

All pCDPs used in this study (pCDP, pCDP-Bzl, pCDP-diBzl, pCDP-diPOM) were custom synthesized using green chemistry [35] and phosphorylation of Threonine completed [36–37] by Viva Biotech Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and purchased through Trillience (Toronto, Ontario). Deuterated-methanol NMR solvent (99.8%, CD3OD) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and used for each sample preparation. NMR spectra (1H and 13C) were recorded at room temperature (RT) with a Bruker AvanceIII HD 800 MHz instrument (SUNY-ESF) or a Varian Inova 600 MHz instrument (Cornell University). Chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm) units relative to residual solvent peaks CD3OD (3.31 ppm for 1H, 49.0 ppm for 13C). Splitting patterns are assigned as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), p (pentet), m (multiplet), dd (doublet of doublets), ddd (doublet of doublet of doublets), dddd (doublet of doublet of doublet of doublets), dq (doublet of quartets), dt (doublet of triplets), td (triplet of doublets), qd (quartet of doublets), and pd (pentet of doublets). All NMR spectra were analyzed with MNOVA software (v.10.0). Supplemental Figures 1–4 show 1H NMR spectra for the pCDP compounds.

Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) Analysis

Each pCDP standard sample was diluted from 100 mM of stock pCDP in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) down to 1 μM pCDP in 50:50 methanol:water and 2 μL was separated using reverse-phase high resolution UHPLC-MS with an Agilent Zorbax RRHD Eclipse XDB-C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm particle diameter), 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (organic phase), and 0.1% formic acid in water (aqueous phase) at a rate of 0.5 mL/min for 15 minutes at 40°C (through the Chromelon Xpress software system) on a Thermo Scientific Dionex Ulitmate3000 UHPLC system, equipped with a diode array detector and connected to a Thermo-Scientific Q Exactive hybrid quadupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Boyce Thompson Institute Mass Spectrometry Center, Cornell University). A solvent gradient scheme was used: 5% organic for 1.5 minutes, a linear increase to 100% organic over 11 minutes, and then a 2 minute hold at 100% organic before decreasing back to 5% organic over 0.1 minutes with a final hold at 5% organic for the last 0.4 minutes, for a total of 15 minutes. The Thermo-Scientific Xcalibur software package was used to visualize, analyze, and depict the LCMS data shown in Supplemental Figure 5.

Preparation of pCDP and inhibitor treatment solutions

All pCDPs were solubilized in DMSO to a stock concentration of 100 mM and stored at 4°C. The BACE1 inhibitor LY2811376 was solubilized in DMSO to a stock concentration of 10mM and stored at −80°C. Further dilutions of these compounds were routinely prepared in DMSO (unless indicated otherwise) and the final concentration of DMSO in media during all cell treatments or in all enzymatic assay solutions did not exceed 0.4%.

Cell treatments for analysis of AβPP processing

Cells were routinely plated and treated as described below unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. Cells were plated at a density of 2×105 cells per well in six-well cluster dishes in 2 mL of complete media and grown for 16–24 hours. Cells were washed twice with DMEM only and re-fed with 1 mL of complete media containing pCDPs, inhibitors or DMSO and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were washed, re-treated for an additional 24 hours and the conditioned media (CM) was collected and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove intact cells and cellular debris. An aliquot of the cleared CM was combined with 4X Laemmli SDS-sample buffer containing 25 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and used for the analysis of secreted AβPP fragments by immunoblotting. This same 48 hour cell treatment procedure was performed to assess cell viability using a TC20 automated cell counter (BioRad), where live cells were distinguished by selective Trypan Blue staining of dead cells.

Preparation of cell lysates

Following the removal of the CM as described above, cell monolayers were washed twice with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution to remove residual media and lysed in 200–250 μL of lysis buffer (LB; 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% Triton X-100, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 500 µM 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 10 µg /mL Aprotinin, 10 µg/mL Leupeptin, and 5 µg/mL Pepstatin) for 30 minutes at 4°C with rocking. Crude lysates were collected and centrifuged at 28,000 × g for 20 minutes at 4°C to remove cellular debris and insoluble material. The clarified whole cell lysates were removed, total protein was quantified using the DC Protein Assay with Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a standard and then combined with 4X Laemmli SDS-sample buffer containing 25 mM DTT for analysis by immunoblotting.

Time course of pCDP-diBzl treatment

To obtain roughly the same protein levels and to harvest CM for all time points simultaneously, all cells were plated at the same time at a density of 2×105 cells per well in six-well cluster dishes in 2 mL of complete media and grown for 16–24 hours. All wells were then washed twice with DMEM only and two wells were re-fed with 1 mL of complete media containing 400 μM of pCDP-diBzl, two wells were re-fed with 1mL of complete media containing DMSO only, and the rest of the wells were re-fed with complete media only (48 hour time point). After 24 hours, media was removed from four currently untreated wells, washed with DMEM only, and then two wells were re-fed with 1 mL of complete media plus 400 μM of pCDP-diBzl while the other two wells were re-fed with 1 mL of complete media plus DMSO only (24 hour time point). At approximately the same time, the cells for the 48 hour time point were washed and re-fed with media containing DMSO or 400 μM of pCDP-diBzl for another 24 hours (it was from this final 24 hour collection period that the 48 hour time point was collected). The same process was followed after an additional 12, 16, and 20 hours to obtain the 12, 8 and 4 hour treatment time points, respectively. At the end of the 48 hour experiment, all CM was collected and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove intact cells and cellular debris. An aliquot of the cleared CM was combined with 4X Laemmli SDS-sample buffer containing 25 mM DTT and used for the analysis of secreted AβPP fragments by immunoblotting. Cells were washed and lysed as described above.

Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophloresis (SDS-PAGE) and Immunoblotting

Whole cell lysates (WCLs) and CM were prepared as described above and various amounts were analyzed by immunoblotting as indicated in the figure legends. Samples and protein standards were adjusted as needed to the desired total protein amount using LB (for WCL samples) or to equal volume using growth media (for CM samples). Housekeeping protein β–tubulin was used as a loading control for all WCL blots except those corresponding to treatments of H4-BACE1 cells, where Stain Free total protein provided a more reliable loading control at the high total protein loading level that was needed to detect endogenous AβPP [38].

All CM samples (except for sAβ, described below) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels [39] and transferred to PVDF membrane without methanol [40] with constant cooling. Membranes were blocked with Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween (TBST; 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk for 1–2 hours at RT and then incubated with primary antibodies (diluted in TBST containing 0.5–1% BSA) at the following dilutions: anti-sAβPPα (EPR5119(2), 1:15,000) or anti-sAβPPβ (25 ng/mL). Anti-sAβPPα was incubated for 2– 3 hours at RT and anti-sAβPPβ antibody was incubated overnight at 4°C. Membranes were incubated for 2–3 hours at RT with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:10,000 in TBST containing 1% milk). Pierce ECL Western Blotting substrate (for sAβPPα) or Pierce SuperSignal West Pico substrate (for sAβPPβ) were used to visualize the results on X-ray film Band intensities were quantified by ImageJ and a background area of the same size was taken above each band and subtracted. These resulting values were first normalized to the averaged DMSO control for each protein and then further normalized for the total protein of the corresponding WCL for each sample (as determined by the DC Protein Assay).

All WCL samples were separated on 4–15% or 4–20% Mini Protean TGX Stain Free precast gels (Bio-Rad). Covalent coupling of the chromophore in the gel to the separated proteins was achieved using an activation time of 1 min. Proteins were transferred to Immun-Blot LF PVDF membrane with 10% methanol for 2 hr at constant current of 250 mA [40]. Membranes were blocked with TBST containing 5% milk for 2 hours at RT or overnight at 4°C. Each membrane was washed four times with TBST (5 min per wash). Membranes were incubated with anti-AβPP (Y188, 1:40,000) overnight at 4°C or for 2.5 hours at RT, with anti-β–tubulin (1:30,000) for 2 hrs at RT, or with anti-BACE1 (1:5,000) for 4 hr at RT. Membranes were incubated for 1.5–3 hours at RT with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as described above.

For WCL blots of treated H4-BACE1 cells, proteins transferred membranes were first imaged using a stain free blot application on a Chemidoc MP system (Bio-Rad), then were incubated with Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate for visualization. For all other WCL blots, Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (for comparison of AβPP levels across different cell models), Clarity Western ECL (for comparison of BACE1 levels across different cell models), or Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (for AβPP and β-tubulin in H4-APP695 cells) were used for visualization. All blots were visualized using Chemi Hi Sensitivity blot application in the Chemidoc MP System (Bio-Rad). Band volumes were quantified using Image Lab (Bio-Rad). For use of β-tubulin as a loading control, desired protein band volumes in a given lane were normalized to the β-tubulin signal volume in that lane. For use of stain free total protein as a loading control, desired protein band volume(s) in each lane were normalized to total protein as quantified using Image Lab (Bio-Rad). For all WCL blots of FL-AβPP where mature and immature FL-AβPP were adequately resolved to allow quantification of each, previously normalized band volumes (for β-tubulin signal or stain free total protein) were further normalized to the average control immature AβPP band volume, as shown in the corresponding graphs.

Total secreted Aβ levels were determined by immunoblotting using the antigen epitope retrieval method essentially as described [41]. Briefly, 20 µL of conditioned media was separated in a 12.5% Bis-Tris-Mes gel and transferred to 0.2 μM nitrocellulose membranes for 90 minutes at 40V using the BioRad Trans blotting system containing 20% methanol [40]. Membranes were steamed for 15 minutes to expose latent epitopes, blocked with TBST-milk and incubated with anti-Aβ antibody (1:4000) for 1 hour at RT followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. Membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and results were visualized using the Pierce ECL Western Blotting substrate. Band intensities were quantified by ImageJ as described above.

Observation of pCDP uptake by LCMS

The following LCMS procedure for cell lysates was adapted from [42]. H4-AβPP695 cells were plated at a density of 1.5×106 cells per 10-cm dish (×20) in complete media and grown at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (90%) containing 10% CO2. After ~24 hours cells were re-fed with 5 mL of fresh media containing various pCDPs (400 μM) or DMSO as indicated in the figure legend (two plates per condition). The remaining ten plates were re-fed with 5mL of fresh media and were used as a “spiked” positive control set. After 24 hours the treated cells were scraped into their conditioned media (duplicates were combined) and collected by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 2000 × g at RT. The remaining 10 untreated dishes (“spiked” positive control set) were scraped, divided into five equal aliquots and cells were collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed three times with cold (4°C) PBS to remove all residual conditioned media and pCDPs. Cell pellets were quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until lysis.

Frozen pellets were thawed on ice for 30 minutes, re-suspended in 500 μL of water and 500 μL of methanol, vortexed, and incubated on ice for 1 hour to facilitate complete lysis. The five “spiked” positive control samples were prepared by adding 1 μL of 1 mM each pCDP or DMSO (1:100 dilution of the stocks in water) to individual pellets, vortexed and incubated on ice for one hour. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 RPM for 30 minutes at 4°C and the supernatants were collected and lyophilized to dryness. Each dried sample was dissolved in 300μL of 50:50 methanol:water and 2 μL was separated using reverse-phase high resolution UHPLC-MS exactly as described above (see LCMS Analysis section of Analysis of custom-synthesized compounds). The Thermo-Scientific Xcalibur software package was used to visualize, analyze, and depict the LCMS data presented here.

BACE1 activity assay

BACE1 activity was determined by incubating 400 μM of individual pCDPs, the BACE1 inhibitor LY2811376 (positive control) or DMSO (negative control) in a reaction mixture containing 25 mM sodium acetate assay buffer, pH 4.42, 1% BSA, 0.2 μg of the catalytic domain of recombinant human BACE1 and 10 μM of Methyl cumaryl amide (Mca) fluorogenic substrate in a final volume of 110 μl. Fluorescence intensity was measured with a Synergy H1 hybrid reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) (excitation 320 nm, emission 405 nm) using a black microplate with half-area wells and an opaque bottom with continuous gentle shaking at 37°C for one hour with readings acquired every 5 minutes. Results were analyzed in Excel 2010 by averaging the DMSO control 1 hour fluorescence intensity values and then normalizing all experimental results for pCDPs and BACE1 inhibitor to this value. The normalized data was then averaged over repeated points (n=6 for all pCDP treatments and DMSO negative control, n=5 for BACE1 inhibitor data), the standard deviations were determined, and the data was graphed using Excel 2010 software.

Statistical analysis

Averages, 20% Coefficient of Variation (CV), standard deviation (S.D.), and statistical analysis for significance via the unpaired, independent Student’s T test for data were determined using Excel 2010. CM and WCL data were expressed as the mean ±20% CV. CM data were deemed significant at p&lt;0.05. 20% CV was used as an estimate for western blot variability to yield more conservative assignments of statistical significance [38]. Cell viability data were expressed as mean ±S.D. and were deemed significant at p&lt;0.05. All graphs were generated in Excel 2010. Approximate EC50 values were determined by fitting the sAβPPβ level versus dose curves to the 4-parameter logistic model Y=(d−a)/{1+(X/c)b}, where a is the lower asymptote, d is the upper asymptote, X is the dose concentration, c is the concentration at which the sAβPPβ level is midway between a and d, and b is the slope factor that describes the steepness of the central linear portion of the curve [43]. Parameters a, b, c and d were optimized by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between experimental and model-predicted values using the Solver add-in within Excel 2010 (Microsoft).

RESULTS

H4 neuroglioma cells stably overexpressing AβPP695wt or BACE1 enable reliable detection of sAβPPβ

BACE1 cleavage of AβPP produces sAβPPβ and C99 fragments (Figure 1A), and is essential for the production of Aβ. The C-terminal fragment, C99, is a transient intermediate in the amyloidogenic pathway that reflects the relative balance of multiple pathways. C99 is processed by γ-secretase [44], is also a substrate for α-secretase [45], and is turned over by both ERAD and ubiquitin-independent lysosomal degradation pathways [46]. Moreover, C99 can be additionally cleaved by C89 to by BACE1 and BACE2 [47], and the proportion of C89 relative to C99 increases with increasing BACE1 expression [48]. In contrast, sAβPPβ (~100 kDa) is secreted to the medium and can be detected (and distinguished from sAβPPα) by antibodies specific for the C-terminus of sAβPPβ [49]. The sAβPPβ fragment therefore serves as an effective proxy for the maximum possible amyloidogenic processing, since for every Aβ peptide molecule produced, a corresponding sAβPPβ fragment must be generated. Importantly, sAβPPβ reflects the amount of AβPP that undergoes the entry step (ie. β-secretase cleavage) into the amyloidogenic pathway (Figure 1). Our goal was to generate two distinct cell lines, via overexpression of AβPP695 or BACE1 that recapitulate two distinct causative mechanisms of AD [16–17, 50], to enable reliable detection of sAβPPβ for evaluating the effects of pCDP treatment on AβPP amyloidogenic processing.

The human H4 neuroglioma cell line, derived from a neuroglioma tumor and adapted for growth in culture [51–52], has been broadly used in AD research [53–56]. In H4 cells, the endogenous AβPP751 isoform (Figure 3A) predominantly undergoes nonamyloidogenic processing, as shown by the absence of sAβPPβ in 15 µL of conditioned media (CM) (Figure 3B) and the abundance of sAβPPα detected in just 2 µL of the same CM (Figure 3C). To generate detectable levels of sAβPPβ, we chose to take two separate approaches: (1) increase the level of the AβPP695 isoform, since this is the predominant form found in neurons [57] and overexpression of AβPP695 is known to increase amyloidogenic processing [58], and (2) increase the level of BACE1 to shift the balance toward amyloidogenic processing [50].

To this end, we generated two distinct H4 cell lines that serve as AD models: the H4-AβPP695 cell line that overexpresses AβPP695 (wild-type) and the H4-BACE1 cell line that overexpresses BACE1 (wild-type) (Figure 3A). The quantity of AβPP695 is increased approximately 15-fold in H4-AβPP695 lysates compared to endogenous AβPP751 in H4 and H4-BACE1 cell lysates, using β-tubulin for normalization across lanes (Figure 3A). BACE1 is robustly detected in 6.8 µg of H4-BACE1 cell lysate, whereas endogenous BACE1 was not detected in 6.8 µg of H4 cell lysate (Figure 3A). Additionally, the level of mature AβPP751 is reduced in the H4-BACE1 cells (Figure 3A), which is consistent with previous results that have shown that most cleavage of AβPP via BACE1 happens after O-glycosylation [59].

As anticipated, both H4-AβPP695 and H4-BACE1 cell lines enable sensitive detection of sAβPPβ (Figure 3B), and produce different relative levels of sAβPPα (Figure 3C). With only 2 µL of CM, sAβPPα is detected in H4-AβPP695 cells after a 3 second exposure time (Figure 3C, top blot). After a 2 minute exposure of the same blot, the less abundant sAβPPα from both H4 and H4-BACE1 cells is detectable (Figure 3C, bottom panel), at the expected (different) molecular weights. Due to robust overexpression of AβPP695 in the H4-AβPP695 cell line, the highly abundant sAβPPα secreted into CM (Figure 3C) is not conducive to observing small changes in nonamyloidogenic processing. However, since AβPP expression remains at an endogenous level in the H4-BACE1 cell line, changes in both sAβPPβ (Figure 3B) and sAβPPα (Figure 3C) can be detected in CM, thereby allowing amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic processing of AβPP to be simultaneously monitored in this cell line. Collectively, these data demonstrate the utility of H4-AβPP695 and H4-BACE1 cells for monitoring sAβPPβ as a proxy for the amyloidogenic processing of AβPP.

The cis-locked pCDP mimic was derivatized to aid in cellular uptake

Since the cis-locked pCDP (Figure 1C) is charged and is not expected to be taken up by cells, we prepared three derivatives that block the phosphate group and are more hydrophobic (Figure 2). The phosphate group in pCDP (Figure 2A) was protected by a single benzyl group (Figure 2B), two benzyl groups (Figure 2C), or two pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) groups (Figure 2D). Notably, since the POM groups are easily removed by cellular esterases [60], the pCDP-diPOM molecule is a “pro-drug” version of the pCDP (Figure 2A). All pCDPs were analyzed by 1H NMR and LCMS to verify their structure and MW (Supplemental Figures 1–5).

Only pCDP-diBzl reduces sAβPPβ in the conditioned media of H4-AβPP695 cells

Using sAβPPβ as a proxy for monitoring amyloidogenic processing of AβPP, the effects of the pCDP compounds (Figure 2) were investigated in H4-AβPP695 cells. H4-AβPP695 cells were treated with 400 µM of pCDP, pCDP-Bzl, pCDP-diBzl, and pCDP-diPOM for a total of 48 hours and 15 µL of CM from the final 24 hours of treatment was analyzed by Western blot for changes in sAβPPβ (Figure 4A). Only pCDP-diBzl had a potent effect on the quantity of sAβPPβ present in the media, severely reducing the amount of detectable sAβPPβ to less than 1% of the control without change in the levels of mature or immature FL-AβPP (Figure 4A). The well-characterized BACE1 inhibitor (LY2811376) was also used to treat cells at 2.5 µM (Figure 4A) and exhibited a similar effect on H4-AβPP695 cell line as the pCDP-diBzl. The other CDP variants (pCDP, pCDP-Bzl, pCDP-diPOM) had little to no effect on the amount of sAβPPβ, despite their related structure. To assess the impact of pCDP-diBzl treatment on cell viability, H4-AβPP695 cells were treated with 200 µM and 400 µM of pCDP-diBzl for 48 hours, trypsinized, stained with Trypan Blue, and counted. Although growth seemed to be slowed in the presence of 200 μM and 400 μM pCDP-diBzl, no significant toxicity was observed (&gt;96% of all cells counted were alive) (Supplemental Figure 6).

A dose-dependence experiment using 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μM of pCDP-diBzl was performed to monitor changes in sAβPPβ in H4-AβPP695 cells (Figure 4B). As shown, 48 hours of treatment with 400 μM of pCDP-diBzl has the most potent impact on sAβPPβ levels (Figure 4B) with an approximate EC50 value of 126 μM (Figure 4B). As described above, the robust production of sAβPPα in these cells (Figure 3C) prevents reliable evaluation of small changes in the non-amyloidogenic pathway. The mature and immature AβPP signal for the DMSO and 400 μM pCDP-diBzl samples from Figures 4A and 4B were combined (n=4) to this highest level of treatment with pCDP-diBzl had no significant impact on FL-AβPP levels (Figure 4C). A same dose-dependent response was also observed on sAβ levels in H4-AβPP695 cells (Figure 4D) with no significant impact on FL-AβPP signal. Additionally, a time-dependence study was performed to see if 48 hours of treatment was crucial for the observed effect on sAβPPβ reduction (Figure 4E). A short exposure time (30 seconds) shows clear reduction of sAβPPβ in CM of pCDP-diBzl treated cells for 12, 24 and 48 hr total time periods (Figure 4E, left). A much longer exposure (10 minutes) reveals additional observable reduction of sAβPPβ at 4 hours (Figure 4E, right), whereas sAβPPβ was not yet detectable even in untreated cells at 2 hours (data not shown). These data demonstrate that pCDP-diBzl treatment of H4-AβPP695 cells reduces secreted sAβPPβ levels without significantly changing FL-AβPP levels, and that this reduction is evident at the earliest time point at which sAβPPβ can be detected.

pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM reduce sAβPPβ in the conditioned media of H4-BACE1 cells

As was observed in the H4-AβPP695 cells, treatment of H4-BACE1 cells with 400μM of pCDP-diBzl yielded a similar decrease in sAβPPβ without a significant impact on FL-AβPP levels (Figure 5A). Additionally, sAβPPα (derived from endogenous AβPP751 in these cells) does not significantly change upon treatment with any of the pCDP compounds, and shows no significant dose-dependence with pCDP-diBzl treatment (Figure 5). The dose-dependent reduction of sAβPPβ induced by pCDP-diBzl treatment of H4-BACE1 cells (Figure 5B) is similar to what was observed in H4-AβPP695 cells, with an EC50 value of approximately 67 μM (Figure 5B). Again, mature and immature FL-AβPP signal for the DMSO and 400 μM pCDP-diBzl samples from Figures 5A and 5B were combined (n=4) to show no significant impact on FL-AβPP levels (Figure 5C). The similar dose dependence and EC50 values in these distinct cell lines, where either AβPP or BACE1 are significantly overexpressed, indicate that pCDP-diBzl does not act through direct competition for a binding partner of either AβPP or BACE1. These data further suggest that pCDP-diBzl might act in both distinct cell lines via a common mechanism to reduce sAβPPβ. In contrast, while 400 µM pCDP-diPOM treatment of H4-AβPP695 cells showed no significant effect, treatment of H4-BACE1 cells with 400 µM pCDP-diPOM significantly reduced the amount of sAβPPβ without changing FL-APP signal (Figure 5A and B). Although this 5-fold reduction is approximately the same as the effect of pCDP-diBzl treatment in these cells, the observation that pCDP-diPOM is ineffective in cells overexpressing AβPP is consistent with a mechanism of action in which pCDP-diPOM blocks AβPP interaction with an amyloidogenic binding partner.

As expected, treatment with 2.5 µM BACE1 inhibitor LY2811376 again inhibits sAβPPβ production in H4-BACE1 cells. Interestingly, a clear, significant increase in both sAβPPα and mature (glycosylated) full length AβPP is observed in this cell model, where only endogenous AβPP751 is expressed (Figure 5A). This suggests that direct inhibition of BACE1 catalytic cleavage of AβPP might increase recycling of AβPP back to the plasma membrane via trafficking of endocytosed AβPP back to the trans-Golgi network and subsequent secretory pathway, where glycosylation and β-secretase activities are active. This effect is not observed in treatments with 400 µM pCDP-diBzl or 400µM pCDP-diPOM, suggesting a different mechanism for these molecules.

Association of pCDPs with and their conversion by H4-AβPP695 cells

To gain insight regarding the fate of pCDPs inside cells, LCMS was used to detect the presence of each compound in lysates from H4-AβPP695 cells treated with the various pCDPs. Importantly, these lysates were extracted using 1:1 methanol/water by volume, which is expected to at least partially solubilize most polar lipids and to denature some proteins. Although the pCDP variants are chemically very similar, LCMS was highly effective for detecting not only the pCDP variant, but also its conversion products. The neutral-charge MW of each pCDP molecule is shown in Figure 2 and the electrospray ionization in positive mode (ESI+) MW for each pCDP is the following: 279 for pCDP, 369 for pCDP-Bzl, 459 for pCDP-diBzl, and 507 for pCDP-diPOM.

For comparison, lysates from cells treated with 400 μM of each pCDP variant (Figure 6A) and lysates from untreated cells that were spiked with 100 μM of respective pCDPs (Figure 6B) were analyzed by LCMS. Lysate from cells treated with 400 μM of pCDP-diBzl displays not only the expected MW 459 but also a substantial amount of MW 369, corresponding to pCDP-Bzl. In contrast, lysate from untreated cells spiked with pCDP-diBzl shows predominantly MW 459 and significantly lower MW 369. This suggests that pCDP-diBzl is converted to pCDP-Bzl inside the cell. Similarly, treatment with 400 μM of pCDP-diPOM shows an elevated amount of MW 279 and no detectable MW 507, while the untreated cell lysate spiked with pCDP-diPOM shows a substantial peak only for MW 507 (Figure 6). This supports successful entry of pCDP-diPOM into cells where active esterases efficiently cleave the POM groups in vivo [60], whereas esterase activity in the spiked case could be inhibited in 1/1 methanol/water. Lysate from pCDP-Bzl treated cells does show MW 369, demonstrating that the pCDP-Bzl molecule does associate with cells, although as shown above it does not significantly reduce sAβPPβ (Figure 4A). Cells treated with pCDP do not show MW 279 significantly above the DMSO control, but spiked cells with pCDP do, indicating that although pCDP itself is detectable it does not associate with treated cells sufficiently enough to be detected. Together, these results show that pCDP-diBzl, pCDP-Bzl, and pCDP-diPOM associate with H4-AβPP695 cells, and that pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM are modified by the cell.

pCDPs do not specifically inhibit the catalytic activity of BACE1

Since a reproducible effect on reduction of sAβPPβ by pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM was observed, we sought to determine whether these compounds directly inhibit the activity of the BACE1 catalytic domain. Using recombinant human BACE1 catalytic domain and an intramolecularly quenched Mca fluorogenic substrate as part of a FRET-based assay [61], we tested 400 μM of each pCDP variant for inhibition of BACE1catalytic activity. Additionally, we tested the known BACE1 inhibitor LY2811376 at 2.5 μM as a positive control for reduced BACE1 catalytic activity. As shown in Figure 7, while LY2811376 showed a potent decrease as expected, we saw no significant decrease in the catalytic activity of recombinant, purified BACE1 catalytic domain (as measured by fluorescence intensity) with any of pCDP variants at 400 μM. These results demonstrate that pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM do not act as a direct inhibitor of BACE1 catalytic activity, and point to an alternate mechanism by which they inhibit amyloidogenic AβPP processing in H4 cell models of AD.

DISCUSSION

The effective treatment of AD will require an in-depth understanding of key interactions that mediate the amyloidogenic processing of AβPP. Although BACE1 cleavage of AβPP initiates this process, therapeutic strategies to inhibit this catalytic reaction are complicated by the essential functions of BACE1 that include myelination, axon guidance, muscle spindle formation, and neuronal network functions (reviewed in 62). Hence, an agent that could specifically reduce BACE1 cleavage of AβPP without reducing its cleavage of other normal cellular targets is highly desirable. In this study, we have investigated the possibility that the cis conformation of a phospho-Thr-Pro peptide bond in the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP might function as a signal for increased amyloidogenic AβPP processing. We designed and synthesized four “cis-locked” pCDP compounds and tested their effect on sAβPPβ production in two distinct AD cell models. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that one specific pCDP derivative, pCDP-diBzl, is active in suppressing amyloidogenic processing of AβPP in both H4-AβPP695 and H4-BACE1 cell models. Additionally, a second derivative, pCDP-diPOM, has a similar effect but only in H4-BACE1 cells, where solely endogenous AβPP is expressed. Moreover, we have demonstrated that neither the pCDP-diBzl nor the pCDP-diPOM directly inhibit the BACE1 catalytic site in vitro. These findings support a pathogenic role of the cis conformation in promoting amyloidogenic AβPP processing, and open new avenues toward the development of AβPP-specific therapeutic agents to inhibit this role.

An important consideration to address is what the active form of each compound is in the cell. Our mass spectrometry data of WCL from cells treated with pCDP-diPOM shows full deprotection of pCDP-diPOM to pCDP, which allows us to conclude that the effective form of pCDP-diPOM in treated H4-BACE1 cells is the deprotected pCDP. Of the molecules tested, pCDP is the closest mimic of phosphoThr-Pro, thus it is expected to be less effective in a background of excess AβPP (as in H4-AβPP695 cells), providing a plausible explanation for why it does not work in H4-AβPP695 cells. For the pCDP-diBzl compound, our mass spectrometry data of WCL from cells treated with this compound shows that pCDP-diBzl is partially converted to pCDP-Bzl, but not to pCDP. Importantly, direct treatment with pCDP-Bzl did not display significant activity in either cell type, even though it is observed in WCL from H4-AβPP695 cells. Thus, the active form in pCDP-diBzl treated cells is most likely pCDP-diBzl, although the prominent level of pCDP-Bzl in these cells cannot be ruled out as possibly contributing to activity.

We have employed two distinct cell models to investigate what are potentially multi-target mechanisms of these compounds. Our H4-AβPP695 and H4-BACE1 cell lines provide comparative disease models in which two distinctly different perturbations, the over expression of AβPP or BACE1, both recapitulate the disease state as measured by elevated amyloidogenic AβPP processing. Since AD is a complex disease with many potential targets that can influence AβPP processing [63], and given the known pleiotropic effects of diketopiperizine molecules [3], it is plausible that the observed effects of these compounds involve multiple targets. Indeed, the use of both AD cell models reveals that pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM have at least partially different mechanisms of activity. The observation that pCDP-diBzl has a similar dose-dependence in both models suggests that its primary target is not a direct binding partner of either AβPP or BACE1, which are each robustly over expressed in their respective cell lines. This would potentially rule out numerous cellular factors as pCDP-diBzl targets known to directly bind to AβPP [64]. However, the inability of pCDP-diPOM to alter amyloidogenic processing of AβPP in H4-AβPP695 cells suggests that the target of pCDP-diPOM may indeed be an amyloidogenic-promoting binding partner of AβPP, whereby the robust over expression of AβPP in H4-AβPP695 cells prevents effective inhibition of this pathogenic interaction. Moreover, the effectiveness of pCDP-diPOM in H4-BACE1 cells, where BACE1 is robustly over expressed, supports the possibility that pCDP-diPOM blocks an AβPP-specific binding partner.

The pattern of AβPP proteolytic products induced by compound treatments offers clues regarding potential mechanisms of pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM activities. Specifically, both compounds reduced sAβPPβ and total secreted Aβ levels without significantly changing sAβPPα or matAβPP levels. These observations suggest that these compounds do not significantly increase levels of AβPP at the plasma membrane (which should increase sAβPPα), and do not increase AβPP levels in the ER/Golgi secretory pathway (which should increase matAβPP). The observation of this same pattern of AβPP proteolytic products with both compounds suggests that pCDP-diPOM and pCDP-diBzl might act at a common point in the complex system of networks that govern AβPP processing. BACE1 cleavage of AβPP, which produces sAβPPβ and is the first requisite step in the production of Aβ, involves additional regulatory factors that could serve as targets of pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM. While BACE1 endocytosis is ARF6-dependent [65], AβPP is internalized via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (reviewed in 64). The sorting of AβPP and BACE1 into common intracellular acidic vesicles via different pathways [66], which is central to BACE1 cleavage of AβPP [67–69], offers many potential targets [64]. Together, these results suggest a model in which both pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM inhibit the association of AβPP and BACE1 and subsequent generation of sAβPPβ, but that their activities are mediated through different targets (Figure 8).

While additional studies are underway to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM inhibit amyloidogenic processing, it is informative to consider mechanisms deduced for other small molecules that alter AβPP proteolytic processing. For example, treatment of rat primary cortical neurons with statins similarly decreases secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42, but significantly reduces matAβPP via a cholesterol-independent mechanism that involves selective reduction of AβPP phosphorylation at Thr668 [70], pointing to a central role of T668 phosphorylation in AβPP processing. In another example, treatment of HEK293 cells with the natural product 2,2′,4′-trihydroxychalcone (TDC) from Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) root, reduced sAβPPβ without significant change in matAβPP (as we observe here), by serving as a non-competitive inhibitor of BACE1 catalytic activity [71]. Finally, the metal chelator clioquinol and various derivatives potently inhibit Aβ accumulation in cell models and in mice [72–77]. Treatment of AβPP-CHO cells with clioquinol alone reduced total sAβPP (sAβPPα and sAβPPβ were not distinguished), but the robust reduction of secreted Aβ40 by clioquinol required co-treatment with copper (Cu2+) [77]. The deduced mechanism was via activation of PI3K-Akt and JNK signaling pathways, culminating in the upregulation of secreted matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) that degrade extracellular Aβ [77]. However, the mechanism by which total sAβPP was reduced was not elucidated.

Interestingly, there is an additional mechanism by which clioquinol upregulates MMPs and Aβ clearance, with a possible link to AβPP proteolytic processing. Quinol family compounds, including clioquinol, inhibit the hydroxylation activity of Factor Inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1), one of the two distinct enzymes that initiate unbiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) [78–81]. Under low oxygen levels where FIH-1 activity is low, the stabilized HIF-1α induces expression of numerous genes, including MMPs [82,83]. Hence, the inhibition of FIH-1 by clioquinol stabilizes HIF-1α, which leads to the upregulation of MMPs and subsequent rapid degradation of extracellular Aβ. HIF-1α is stabilized by direct interaction with COPS5 (also known as Jab1), a protein implicated in amyloidogenic processing of AβPP [77,84]. Thus, an additional impact of clioquinol might be to induce elevated HIF-1α levels that compete for COPS5 binding to and stabilization of an amyloidogenic factor, thereby indirectly reducing amyloidogenic processing of AβPP. The multiple signaling pathways that respond to clioquinol, and the COPS5-mediated link between HIF-1α and amyloidogenic AβPP processing, exemplify the many interconnected systems of networks that govern the proteolytic fate of AβPP.

In conclusion, AD is a multifactorial disease that involves factors at the genetic, epigenetic, interactome, and environment levels [63]. To understand such a multi-scale complex system, eukaryotic cell models that simulate the disease state are of great value. Here, we have used two distinct H4 neuroglioma cell lines, each with elevated expression of a single component involved in AβPP processing, to test compounds that mimic the cis conformation of a phospho-Thr-Pro peptide bond in the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP. The activity of pCDP, when delivered to the cell as its precursor pCDP-diPOM, suggests that the cis conformation of the phospho-Thr668-Pro669 motif in AβPP serves as a signal that increases association of AβPP and BACE1, since pCDP is the closest mimic of phosphoThr-Pro and is only active when endogenous levels of APP are present. Conversely, the similar activity of pCDP-diBzl in both comparative AD cell models points to a different target for this compound and suggests that the cis conformation is a broadly used signal, consistent with the wide array of diketopiperizine bioactivities [3]. Based on these results we propose a model in which our two identified active compounds act through different targets, but at comparable points in AβPP processing system. This model provides a framework for investigation of pCDPs binding to specific components of putative association complexes, and for further development of compounds that effectively block interactions that promote Aβ production. Overall, our studies support the idea that the cis isomer is a pathogenic conformation in the determination of AβPP proteolytic fate, and show that small molecules that mimic this conformation reduce amyloidogenic processing of AβPP. These findings provide important insights for guiding the future development of novel AD therapeutics.

Figure 1 Putative role of the phospho-Thr668-P669 cis isomer as a signal in the proteolytic processing of AβPP

(A) AβPP is a type 1 transmembrane protein with a large N-terminal ectodomain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. At the plasma membrane, α and γ secretases are abundant to cleave AβPP into sAβPPα, C83, p3, AICD fragments in the dominant, nonamyloidogenic processing pathway. AβPP can alternatively be internalized and localized to acidic compartments where BACE1 (β secretase) and γ secretase cleave AβPP into sAβPPβ, C99, Aβ, and AICD fragments via amyloidogenic processing. Within the cytoplasmic tail of AβPP, the amino acids T668-P669-E670-E671 form a transient helix capping box (pink box, A). Upon phosphorylation of T668, the helix-capping box is destabilized and two different structures emerge (B). These two structures are distinguished by their cis vs. trans isomer state of the pT668-P669 peptide bond. Pin1 has been identified as a peptidyl prolyl isomerase that rapidly establishes the equilibrium concentrations of 90% trans-pTP and 10% cis-pTP. By creating a covalent bond between the α-carbon of the T668 and the amine of the E670, a “100% cis-locked” phosphorylated cyclic-dipeptide (pCDP) was generated to mimic the cis-pTP motif (C).

Figure 2 The cis-locked pCDP mimic was derivatized to aid in more favorable cellular uptake

Chemical structure variations of the cis-locked pCDP mimic, shown in (A), include the attachment of one benzyl (Bzl) group to produce pCDP-Bzl (B), two benzyl groups (diBzl) to produce pCDP-diBzl (C), or two pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) groups to produce pCDP-diPOM (D).

Figure 6 ESI+ LCMS results show selective uptake and conversion of pCDPs

H4-AβPP695 cells were treated with 400 µM of DMSO (control), pCDP- diBzl (diBzl), pCDP-Bzl (Bzl), pCDP, and pCDP-diPOM (diPOM) for 24 hours and lysates are analyzed by ESI+ LCMS (A). Untreated H4-AβPP695 cells were also lysed and spiked with 100 µM DMSO, diBzl, Bzl, pCDP, and diPOM to act as positive controls (B). Total Ion Chromatograms (TICs) for treated and positive controls were analyzed to find MWs 279 (279.07360, mass tolerance 0.1 mmu), 369 (369.12050, mass tolerance 0.5 mmu), 459 (459.16706, mass tolerance 0.1 mmu), and 507 (507.20940, mass tolerance 0.1 mmu) (A, B). All of the graphs (A, B) show relative abundance of these specific MWs and peaks are labeled with retention time.

Figure 7 pCDPs do not specifically inhibit the catalytic activity of BACE1

The activity of the BACE1 catalytic domain is observed through the cleavage of the Mca fluorogenic substrate. For each time point, the average is plotted (n=6, and n=5 for BACE1 inhibitor data) and error (+/− standard deviation) was determined. Intensity is normalized to the 1 hour fluorescence intensity for the DMSO control sample.

Figure 8 Proposed model for pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM mechanisms of action

A) The disease state, induced by elevated expression of either AβPP695 or BACE1, increases the association of AβPP and BACE1 via a cytoplasmic association complex that promotes sAβPPβ production. B) pCDP-diBzl is proposed to inhibit formation of the association complex, independent of AβPP and BACE1 binding surfaces. C) pCDP-diPOM is proposed to inhibit formation of the association complex by directly blocking the AβPP binding partner in the association complex.
