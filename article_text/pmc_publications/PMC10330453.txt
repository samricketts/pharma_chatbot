Background:

Detecting clinically meaningful changes in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is critical.

Objective:

The objective of this exploratory study was to examine the cross-sectional relationship between a performance-based IADL test, the Harvard Automated Phone Task (APT), and cerebral tau and amyloid burden in cognitively normal (CN) older adults.

Methods:

Seventy-seven CN participants underwent flortaucipir tau and Pittsburgh Compound B amyloid PET. IADL were assessed using the three Harvard APT tasks: prescription refill (APT-Script), health insurance company call (APT-PCP), and bank transaction (APT-Bank). Linear regression models were used to determine associations between each APT task and entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, or precuneus tau with or without an interaction with amyloid.

Results:

Significant associations were found between APT-Bank task rate and interaction between amyloid and entorhinal cortex tau, and APT-PCP task and interactions between amyloid and inferior temporal and precuneus tau. No significant associations were found between the APT tasks and tau or amyloid alone.

Conclusions:

Our preliminary findings suggest an association between a simulated real-life IADL test and interactions of amyloid and several regions of early tau accumulation in CN older adults. However, some analyses were underpowered due to the small number of participants with elevated amyloid, and findings should be interpreted with caution. Future studies will further explore these associations cross-sectionally and longitudinally in order to determine whether the Harvard APT can serve as a reliable IADL outcome measure for preclinical AD prevention trials and ultimately in the clinic setting.

pmcIntroduction

Activities of daily living (ADL), defined as essential activities that individuals must perform in order to live and care for themselves, are dependent on a variety of motor, cognitive, and socio-emotional skills [1]. ADL are classified as either 1) basic ADL (BADL) or 2) instrumental ADL (IADL). BADL refer to essential personal care such as dressing, bathing, toileting, feeding, etc. [2], while IADL consist of much more complex activities such as handling money, public transportation, shopping, preparing meals, cleaning, managing medications, and keeping track of appointments. [3]. The ability to perform IADL is necessary for the maintenance of independent living, well-being, and even health-related quality of life [3]. In addition, IADL performance has been associated with early cognitive decline and can often present in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4]. Although deficits in attention, memory, semantic interference, and executive function are hallmarks of cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the key clinical features consists of impairment in IADL and has become a major contributor to income loss for patients and their caregivers [5].

Throughout the years, information about an individual’s IADL have been commonly obtained by asking someone who knows them well to complete a questionnaire about their functioning. Less frequently, individuals are asked to report directly about their own functioning [3]. For example, questionnaires like Lawton and Brody’s, Functional Activities Questionnaire, and the Everyday Cognition scale have been more widely used in relation to AD biomarker studies because of their ease of use. In addition, sensitive objective performance-based IADL tests have been deployed. One disadvantage of some of these IADL performance-based tests is that many of them are administered in a simulated setting outside of the individual’s real-life environment, that is, an artificial setting. However, more recent efforts to develop assessments that more accurately mimic everyday life have been made, which may better approximate IADL changes that occur in early-stage AD.

Previous studies exploring AD pathology have found that IADL impairment has been associated with temporal and parietal atrophy, lower amyloid-β 1–42 and higher total tau in the cerebrospinal fluid, and parietal and frontal hypometabolism [6, 7]. These findings have been associated amongst non-demented individuals, including cognitively normal (CN) individuals and those with MCI, signaling the potential importance that IADL play in identifying individuals at risk of decline earlier in the disease process. Notably, tau accumulation is known as one of the hallmarks of AD pathology and has been the focus of many studies in recent years exploring in-vivo and post-mortem individuals [8–10]. Previously, a study conducted by Halawa and colleagues found that greater medial and inferior temporal tau and cortical amyloid burden were associated with greater IADL impairment in individuals with MCI and AD dementia [11].

More recent studies, analyzing data from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease (A4) Study screening cohort that underwent amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, found modest associations between IADL difficulties, measured by a questionnaire administered to both participants and study partners, cortical amyloid burden [12] and regional cerebral tau burden [13] in CN older adults at risk for AD. Moreover, a study by Gonzalez and colleagues found an association between IADL, using the Financial Capacity Instrument-Short Form (FCI-SF, an assessment that evaluates everyday financial activities to discriminate between cognitive healthy older adults and cognitive impairment) and the interaction between cortical amyloid and inferior temporal cortex tau, and the interaction between cortical amyloid and precuneus tau in CN individuals [14]. However, the FCI-SF does not capture other domains of IADL. Overall, these previous studies have been inconsistent in how they measure IADL, and the tests used widely differ in the severity of IADL changes they can capture, giving the rise for the need to create more sensitive scales that will focus on the earliest changes in IADL.

As the need increases for detecting clinically meaningful changes over and above the normal aging process, evaluating innovative and sensitive methods to measure IADL is becoming increasingly important to assist and prepare individuals, caregivers, and primary care physicians facing the early stages of AD. Given that cognitive testing is one of the primary ways to measure normal and abnormal cognitive aging [15], and that there are a few reliable objective assessments that measure diminished IADL, the goal of the current exploratory study was to examine the cross-sectional association between a novel and sensitive phone performance-based IADL assessment, the Harvard Automated Phone Task (APT), which includes 3 tasks (prescription refill, health insurance, and banking), and regional cerebral tau and cortical amyloid burden in CN older adults. We hypothesized that we would find associations between the challenging Harvard APT tasks and cerebral regions of early tau deposition, as tau tracks better than amyloid burden with clinical manifestations.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Data was obtained on 77 CN older adults from two studies, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living study (R01 AG053184) and the Subjective Cognitive Decline study (R01 AG058825). Participant demographics and characteristics can be found in Table 1. Participants were mostly non-Hispanic (97%) and White (86%) and ranged in age from 60.5 to 87.5. Mean years of education was 16.5, and 65% of participants were female. Participants’ Mini-Mental State exam scores ranged from 26 to 30, all had a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0, and all scored in the normal range on the Logical Memory II subscale delayed paragraph recall. Both studies recruited participants from the community, while the Subjective Cognitive Decline study also recruited participants from the memory disorders clinics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Of note, only five participants in the current sample were recruited from a memory disorders clinic. Participants were in general good health, on stable medications and did not have a current diagnosis of significant psychiatric or medical disorders. Participants were asked to complete cognitive assessments and questionnaires about IADL, mood, and behavior, as well as imaging.

The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Partners Healthcare Inc. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to initiation of study procedures in accordance with the IRB guidelines.

Measures

IADL were measured using the Harvard APT, which was developed and validated at the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at BWH and MGH [16, 17]. The Harvard APT has previously been found to have adequate validity and reliability (Cronbach’s α value of 0.81–0.87) and has been associated with cognitive measures cross-sectionally and longitudinally and with other IADL assessments, both subjective questionnaires and performance-based assessments [16–18]. Participants were given instructions to independently undertake the Harvard APT while in the research clinic, which can be completed in about 10 minutes using any phone that has buttons containing digits and letters. As part of the Harvard APT, participants navigate an interactive voice response system (IVRS) to perform three tasks that are designed to measure IADL: 1) refilling a prescription (APT-Script), where participants are given a mock pill bottle and asked to call a pharmacy to refill their prescription, 2) calling the health insurance company to select a new primary care physician when provided with a mock card with a member ID number (APT-PCP), and 3) making a bank account transfer and payment (APT-Bank), where they are given a mock savings account number, checking account number, and bank statement. Participants are provided with the amount of money they owe for federal taxes and instructed to make a transfer from their savings account to their checking account to make the payment. In addition, they are allowed to take notes on a piece of paper to complete this task. For each of the three tasks, metrics included total time (until disconnected), number of correctly completed steps, number of step errors, number of repetitions of steps, and correct completion of the task. Performance is measured by the task rate, defined as the number of correct steps divided by the total task time (higher score indicates better performance).

Tau and Amyloid PET Data

PET tracers, C-11 -Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and 18F-Flortaucipir (FTP) (previously known as AV-1451 or T807), were synthesized and administered at the MGH PET Facility. A GE Discovery scanner was utilized in order to acquire PET images using 3D mode; 63 image planes; 15.2cm axial field of view; 5.6mm transaxial resolution and 2.4mm slice interval; 39 frames: 12×15 seconds, 57×60 seconds. FTP was synthesized, prepared, and administered according to the MGH Radioactive Drug Research Committee-approved protocols [19]. Following a 10 millicurie (mCi) injection, 18F-FTP data was acquired with a 3D list mode, dynamic protocol using the above PET camera, with static 80–100-minute acquisition. PET data were reconstructed, and attenuation corrected, and each frame was evaluated to verify adequate count statistics and absence of head motion. Freesurfer (version 5.3.0) [20] was used to express specific binding with region of interest (ROI) as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) to cerebellar grey as previously described [21, 22]. Based on previous work finding significant associations with IADL in these regions in CN older adults [14], three cortical and subcortical ROIs were assessed: entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal, and precuneus.

PiB was synthesized and dynamic PiB PET imaging acquisition was performed as previously described [23–26]. 15 mCi 11C-PiB was administered, followed immediately by a 70-minute image acquisition. Cortical PiB retention was expressed as distribution volume ratio (DVR), based on Logan plots of time-activity curves (cerebellar grey reference) [23, 27]. A value of global PiB retention consisting of an aggregate of cortical regions that typically have elevated PiB retention in AD dementia (frontal, lateral temporal and parietal, and retrosplenial neocortex (FLR)) was used in the analyses below. This value was dichotomized using a threshold for PiB-positivity of a DVR of 1.20, which has been previously published by our group based on a Gaussian mixture modeling approach [28]. Analyses were additionally repeated with continuous PiB—see Supplementary Materials.

Statistical Analysis

All analyses for this study were conducted in R 4.2.0 [29] with R Studio version 2022.12.0, and figures were produced with the ggplot2 package [30]. First, Pearson correlations between the tasks of the Harvard APT were computed, as well as between each Harvard APT task and each tau region (entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, and precuneus) and PiB FLR, to evaluate the unadjusted associations across all participants. P-values were then adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. Multiple linear regression models were constructed in the primary analyses to determine the association between each Harvard APT task rate and the different tau regions, as well as cortical amyloid. Each tau region was tested in its own model with APT task rate as the outcome variable and tau or amyloid as the predictor of interest, including age, sex, and years of education as covariates.

In the secondary analyses, an interaction between cortical amyloid and regional tau was added to each model. In all models, a square transformation was applied to the APT-Script and APT-PCP task rates to correct for its left skew, and a log transformation was applied to the APT-Bank task rate to correct for its right skew. Under these transformations, each of the conditions of linearity, homoskedasticity, normal distribution of residuals, and a lack of multicollinearity and outliers (assessed with Cook’s distance) were all met for all models. All continuous variables were standardized with a z-score transformation before inclusion. All reported regression models were run after these transformations. Standardized coefficients (β), t-test statistics, and significance test results (p-values) were reported. Analyses were considered statistically significant at a p-value &lt;0.05.

Results

Participant demographics and characteristics are presented in Table 1. Forty-seven of the 77 participants were from the Instrumental Activity of Daily Living study, while 30 participants were from the Subjective Cognitive Decline study. The IADL study had participants who were older on average, but there were otherwise no significant demographic differences between the two groups. Only five participants were recruited from a memory disorders clinic, while the rest were recruited from the community. Unadjusted correlations between each of the APT tasks and tau regions, as well as PiB FLR, revealed no significant associations between the two sets of metrics, with weak correlation coefficients ranging between r(75) = −0.12 and 0.13. Between APT tasks, the APT-Bank displayed moderate correlation with both APT-Script (r(75) = 0.33, adjusted p = 0.045) and APT-PCP (r(75) = 0.31, adjusted p = 0.045). No significant correlation was found between the APT-Script and APT-PCP after adjustment for multiple comparisons. These results are detailed in Table 2. When correlations were repeated using transformed versions of the tasks, the results were unchanged (Supplementary Table 1).

Primary analyses

Multiple linear regression models were first run with amyloid and each tau region separately predicting each APT task rate, adjusting for years of education, age, and sex. No significant association was found between amyloid burden alone or tau burden alone within any examined region and any of the three APT task rates. These results are summarized in Table 3, and full model results are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

Secondary Analyses

An interaction between cortical amyloid burden (dichotomous PiB, PiB+/PiB-) and regional tau was added to each model. As seen on Figure 1.A.i, for the APT-Bank task, a significant interaction between entorhinal tau and amyloid was found (standardized β = −0.61, t(69) = −2.31, p = 0.02; the model as a whole explained 17% of the variance in the APT-Bank scores: R2 = 0.17, F(6, 69) = 2.30, p = 0.04). For the APT-PCP task, a significant interaction with amyloid was found for inferior temporal tau (β = −0.62, t(69) = −2.65, p = 0.01; model R2 = 0.22, F(6, 69) = 3.23, p = 0.007) and precuneus tau (β = −0.51, t(69) = −2.01, p = 0.048; model R2 = 0.19, F(6, 69) = 2.63, p = 0.02). Moreover, a marginally significant interaction was found with entorhinal tau (β = −0.50, t(69) = −1.90, p = 0.06). No significant interactions were found for the APT-Script task. These results are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in Supplementary Table 2 for all tasks, and additionally visualized in Figure 1 for the APT-PCP and APT-Bank tasks and in Supplementary Figure 1 for the APT-Script task.

Additionally, to further examine the significant interactions between amyloid and tau for the APT-PCP and APT-Bank tasks, models were run examining the effect of tau within the PiB+ and PiB- groups separately. The same covariates and methods as in the analysis with the interaction term were used. There was a significant negative tau effect in the PiB+ group only in the model where the APT-PCP task rate was predicted by inferior temporal tau (β = −0.40, t = −2.31, p = 0.04) and not in any of the other models. That is, greater inferior temporal tau burden was associated with worse performance on the APT-PCP task rate within the PiB+ group, while there were no significant associations within the PiB+ group for any other task or tau region. In all models within the PiB- group, the association between regional tau and APT-PCP or APT-Bank was not significant (all p &gt; 0.05).

Finally, the analyses were then repeated using a continuous, rather than dichotomized, amyloid variable (see results in Supplementary Table 3). The results were similar though attenuated.

Discussion

Employing data from 77 CN older adult participants who underwent PET imaging, the current study investigated the cross-sectional association between regional cerebral accumulation of tau, cortical amyloid, and a novel performance based IADL assessment known as the Harvard APT. Our findings indicated no association between amyloid or tau pathology in isolation across all regions of interest and any of the three APT task rates (i.e., APT-Script, APT-PCP, APT-Bank). This confirms results from a previous study by Gonzalez and colleagues with a larger sample that found no association between another performance-based IADL test, the FCI-SF (a measurement of everyday financial activities), and tau burden in isolation in CN individuals [14].

On the other hand, the current study did find significant associations between the more complex APT-PCP and APT-Bank tasks and the interaction of tau and amyloid. Specifically, we saw a significant association within CN participants with elevated amyloid (PiB+) in which worse performance on the APT-PCP task was associated with greater inferior temporal and precuneus tau burden, as well as a marginal association with entorhinal cortex tau. We also we saw a significant association within CN participants with elevated amyloid in which worse performance on the APT-Bank task was associated with greater entorhinal cortex tau burden. These findings are also in line with Gonzalez and colleagues’ previous results, who found an association between IADL and the interaction of inferior temporal and precuneus tau burden with cortical amyloid in CN individuals [14]. Lastly, we found no associations with the least challenging task, APT-Script. As previously demonstrated in the clinical validation of the Harvard APT, the more complex tasks, APT-PCP and APT-Bank, have been associated with executive function, while the simpler APT-Script task has been associated with attention and processing speed, which may partly contribute to the differential association seen here with AD pathology [16, 17]. These results suggest that the Harvard APT may be a sensitive simulated real-life IADL measure for detecting brain pathologies that may be contributing to functional impairment among CN older adults. Once sufficient longitudinal data is obtained in this cohort, we will have the opportunity to better understand these relationships.

While these results are preliminary and the associations were modest, to the authors knowledge, this is one of the first studies to report an association between an objective measure of IADL and the interaction of tau and amyloid in a cohort of CN older adults. Notably, the findings from the current study signal that the Harvard APT may be a promising IADL measure for early-stage AD by showing an association with AD biomarkers in CN older adults. Previous studies have shown similar associations among CN individuals, albeit with much larger samples. Specifically, two studies employing the A4 screening CN sample showed separate modest associations between IADL, measured by the a participant and study partner-reported questionnaire, the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Prevention Instrument, and cortical amyloid (n=4,486) and regional cerebral tau (n=447), but not with the interaction of amyloid and tau [12, 13]. In addition, in a sample of 309 CN older adults who underwent the FCI-SF, there was a cross-sectional association between worse IADL and greater cortical amyloid, as well as a longitudinal association between worsening IADL over time and the interaction of greater baseline cortical amyloid and neurodegeneration (measured as cortical thickness on magnetic resonance imaging)[31].

It is important to note that the Harvard APT task may better capture an individual’s overall ability to complete complex everyday activities compared to self- and study partner-reported questionnaires, given the challenging nature of the test (e.g., maintaining sustained attention, performing calculations, working memory, set shifting, entering names and words using phone keys, etc.). In particular, the more complex tasks, APT-PCP and APT-Bank, may require higher executive functioning skills that necessitate the individual to plan, organize, and stay focused on completing the task in a timely manner. As noted with the above studies employing the FCI-SF and other studies that have attempted to isolate critical items within IADL questionnaires that predict early changes in individuals at risk for AD, difficulties managing one’s finances appears to be a sensitive marker of AD risk [32, 33]. With future at home and longitudinal data available, we will be able to examine whether the Harvard APT proves to be an objective measurement that could be utilized as a screening tool to detect AD pathology across different settings (e.g., individuals’ own home, primary care physician’s office, etc.,) as well as track clinically meaningful early changes in everyday functioning.

The current study has several limitations that need to be clearly stated. First, the authors acknowledge that the sample size was small. With only 77 participants, it is possible that a small number of participants drove the reported results. However, no statistically significant outliers were observed in the current sample. Future studies should replicate these findings in larger samples, exploring additional tau regions of interest that may be associated with performance on the Harvard APT. Second, participants in the current study were highly educated and not particularly racially and ethnically diverse (with 86% consisting of non-Hispanic White participants). Therefore, it is important that these findings be replicated in a more representative sample from the community. Third, participants were primarily recruited from the community vs. the clinic (only five participants were recruited from a memory disorders clinic). When excluding these five participants from the analyses, the association between the APT-PCP task rate and the interaction between amyloid and inferior temporal tau remained significant, but other results did not retain significance. Of note, once enrollment is completed for the respective studies, we plan to explore whether there are any differences between these two groups in associations between performance on the Harvard APT and AD biomarkers. Lastly, the current study was cross-sectional and thus, results should be interpreted with caution. With longitudinal follow-up, we may start seeing more associations with the less complex tasks of the Harvard APT, taking advantage of the incremental complexity of the tasks. In sum, future studies with larger samples and longitudinal follow-up are needed to better understand the complex nature of these findings.

In conclusion, in this exploratory study of CN older adults, our preliminary findings suggest an association between the interaction of amyloid and early tau accumulation and a simulated real-life IADL test, the Harvard APT. Once sufficient longitudinal is obtained, future studies will explore this relationship over time to determine whether the Harvard APT can serve as a reliable IADL outcome measure for preclinical AD prevention trials and as a screening tool to detect AD pathology across multiple settings.
