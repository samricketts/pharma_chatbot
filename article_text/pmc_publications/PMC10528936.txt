Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) is a cyclic guanosine monophosphate-degrading enzyme involved in numerous biological pathways. Inhibitors of PDE5 are important therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We previously reported the first generation of quinoline-based PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of AD. However, the short in vitro microsomal stability rendered them unsuitable drug candidates. Here we report a series of new quinoline-based PDE5 inhibitors. Among them, compound 4b, 8-cyclopropyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-4-(((6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methyl)amino)quinoline-6-carbonitrile, shows a PDE5 IC50 of 20nM and improved in vitro microsomal stability (t1/2=44.6min) as well as excellent efficacy in restoring long-term potentiation, a type of synaptic plasticity to underlie memory formation, in electrophysiology experiments with a mouse model of AD. These results provide an insight into the development of a new class of PDE5 inhibitors for the treatment of AD.

pmc3′,5′-Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are members of a highly conserved superfamily of enzymes that degrade the 3′,5′-cyclic nucleotides, adenosine monophosphate (3′,5′-cAMP) and 3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3′,5′-cGMP) (1). As extensively reviewed, there are 11 families of PDEs (PDE1-PDE11) that are further subdivided based on the homology of their C-terminal catalytic domain, with each PDE family having multiple isoforms that differ in length and complexity of the N-terminal regulatory domain (2, 3). PDEs regulate numerous physiological processes based on their tissue distribution, amino acid sequences, regulatory properties, substrate specificities and pharmacological properties. Their dysfunction has been associated with numerous pathophysiological states including those affecting cell growth and proliferation, nervous system, cardiovascular system, immunity, fertility, and metabolism (3). These dysfunctions could be due to various factors such as the activation of receptors, alterations in calcium signaling or elevation in cyclic nucleotides. All these parameters are of vital importance when considering the therapeutic potential of a given PDE isoform. (3).

Several PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5Is), originally developed and marketed for erectile dysfunction due to their vasodilation and smooth muscle relaxation effects, are also approved for the treatment of other diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (4) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (5). The PDE5Is sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil are marketed in the USA, while lodenafil, udenafil and mirodenafil are available in Brasil and Korea (5, 6). Furthermore, numerous studies have been investigating the therapeutic applications of PDE5Is in other diseases, such us stroke, cancer, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (4, 6, 7). Recently a large number of studies have shown a growing interest in PDE5 as a promising target for the treatment of AD. At the pathological level, AD is characterized by intracellular amyloid plaques consisting of amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregates as well as extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau fibrils that hamper proper neuronal functioning (6). Most of the efforts have been directed towards the development of several therapeutic approaches, such us inhibiting neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formation, interfering with tau protein function, combatting inflammation and oxidative damage, decreasing Aβ load in the brain either by the use of agents that inhibit β- and γ-secretases or increase α-secretase (enzymes involved in the Aβ processing), inhibiting Aβ oligomerization or monoclonal antibodies against Aβ (8–10). Recently, FDA approved the use of Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid antibody with limited beneficial effect, and most importantly a risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which present as temporary swelling of the brain. At least three death shave been putatively tied to lecanemab (11). Moreover, the role of tau and Aβ monomers, the amyloid-β precursor protein, and the secretase enzymes in normal physiological processes might present a problem in providing effective and safe approaches to AD therapy (6). An increasing interest in AD research is now directed towards tau protein. Growing evidence is showing that soluble small aggregates of tau protein, namely tau oligomers (oTau), are involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease, as they emerge as more acutely toxic than large insoluble aggregates (12). However, despite the strong correlation between tau protein and AD, the molecular mechanisms by which tau protein induces synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment remain to be elucidated (12). Among the various hypotheses, oTau seems to be responsible for the reduction of the transcriptional factor c-AMP-responsive element binding phosphorylation (13). This observation inspired our experiments, and previous work (12) confirmed that the enhancement of CREB phosphorylation during memory formation was suppressed in animals exposed to oTau. CREB phosphorylation is a post-translational modification involved in gene transcription mechanisms leading to synaptic plasticity and memory formation and is likely to be affected in AD (14, 15). CREB is at the crossroads of several molecular pathways and mechanisms that have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets against AD, including the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) dependent protein kinases (PKG)/CREB pathway, the cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA)/CREB pathway and the mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway (15). The NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB cascade is particularly attractive because drugs boosting it, especially PDE5 inhibitors (12). NO activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) which, in turn, produces cGMP, a cyclic nucleotide whose levels are also downregulated by the PDE5 enzyme. Following its production, cGMP activates PKGs, a family of kinases that have been implicated in the modulation of neurotransmission in memory and are responsible for phosphorylating CREB during long-term potentiation (LTP) (16, 17). LTP is the main form of synaptic plasticity reflecting the activity of synaptic information storage processes, and has been identified as the prime cellular correlate of learning and memory (18). Moreover, up-regulation of the NO cascade through drugs acting on its various molecular components has provided favorable results in studies aimed at finding strategies to counteract the damage of synaptic plasticity and memory by oligomers of Aβ and tau proteins (2, 12).

Within this frame of thinking, the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB cascade offers a safe and unique possibility for the treatment of AD. Particularly, PDE5 looks very appealing due to the widespread use of its inhibitors with limited side effects. A challenge in developing PDE5 inhibitors is to attain a high selectivity, especially versus the PDE6 isozyme, which shares great structural similarity with PDE5 (19). In addition, the inhibition of PDE isozymes such as PDE1, 6 and PDE11 has been associated with the onset of adverse effects, including tachycardia, vision disturbances and back pain (20).

We previously reported the synthesis and biological evaluation of compound 7a (2), a potent and selective quinoline-based PDE5 inhibitor and explored its therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (2). Compound 7a has outstanding inhibitory activity against PDE5 (IC50 = 0.27 nM) and selectivity against all other PDE isoforms greater than 1000-fold (Tables 2 and 3). In silico physicochemical properties of 7a have shown that the compound obeys the Lipinski’s rules of five (2). An in vivo pharmacokinetic study unveiled that 7a is rapidly absorbed in BALB mice when administered orally (50 mg/kg) and is quickly distributed into the brain. The elimination half-lives of 7a in the brain and plasma were 1.04 h and 1.33 h, respectively (2). Based on this prior information, we focused our effort on the evaluation of its metabolic stability to further investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of 7a. The metabolic stability of compound 7a was measured in human liver microsomes (method reported in supporting information) and revealed a half-life of 20.5 min (CLint 0.080 mL/min/mg protein) (Table 1), highlighting the sensitivity of compound 7a to phase I metabolism. Consequently, we performed an in vitro metabolite identification study on compound 7a with the aim of understanding which metabolites are generated upon phase I and phase II glucuronidation metabolic reactions (Table 1). This study pinpointed two major metabolites, M1 and M2 and revealed that only small amount of compound undergoes phase II glucuronidation reaction generating metabolite M6. Metabolite M1 indicated the sensitivity of 7a compound to oxidation reaction, which is likely to occur either at the 2’, 5’ and 6’ positions of the benzene ring (Table 1), or at the hydroxymethyl group of the quinoline ring, or at the benzylic carbon. Moreover, metabolite M1 is responsible for 47% of the metabolism of compound 7a. Based on prior information (21), it is very likely that the cyclopropyl ring is not involved in the oxidation reactions that inactivate the molecule. The high C-H bond dissociation energy of the cyclopropyl moiety results in a reduced susceptibility to oxidative metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes due to the increase in energy needed for the initial hydrogen atom abstraction step (21). Considering these data, and by performing targeted substitutions primarily in the benzylamine moiety we designed and synthesized new derivatives of compound 7a with the aim of slowing down metabolic reactions. We introduced two atoms of deuterium on the benzylic carbon and obtained compound 4d (22). Furthermore, most modifications focused on the benzyl ring. The most significant substitutions generated compounds 4a, 4b, 4c and 4h (Scheme 1) through the replacement of the benzene ring of compound 7a with a pyridine scaffold to block possible sensitive positions on the aromatic ring. This strategy was pursued to minimize the oxidation reactions of the aromatic ring due to the presence of the N atom in the pyridine ring. The metabolite M3 shows a mass difference of −2.0157 Da, identifying a dehydrogenation reaction with the loss of 2 hydrogen atoms, probably from the hydroxymethyl moiety producing an aldehyde group. Instead, the metabolite M4 reveals a mass difference of 29.9741 Da identifying oxidation reactions at two different site of the molecules. We hypothesize that the oxidation of the hydroxymethyl group could explain the small amount of glucuronide metabolite M9 observed. Full experimental procedures are reported in Supplementary data.

The quinoline derivatives 4a-h were synthesized according to the procedures reported in Fiorito et al. (2). Briefly, 4-amino-3-bromobenzonitrile was reacted with ethoxymethylenemalonate under refluxing conditions in toluene to yield diethyl 2-(((2-bromo-4-cyanophenyl)amino)methylene)malonate. The cyclization of diethyl 2-(((2-bromo-4-cyanophenyl)amino)methylene)malonate in refluxing diphenyl ether afforded oxoquinoline. The chlorination of oxoquinoline with POCl3 provided 4-chloroquinoline derivative 1 in good yield. LC/MS and NMR analyses of compound 1 were in accordance with the published data (12). The reaction of 4-chloroquinoline derivative 1 (Scheme 1) with suitably substituted amines in the presence of DIPEA afforded the quinoline esters 2a-h. Organometallic reaction in the presence of palladium was used to obtain quinolines 3a-h. In particular, the Suzuki coupling reaction of 2a-h with cyclopropylboronic acid, in the presence of Cs2CO3 and a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4 yielded 3a-h. Finally, the reduction of quinoline esters 3a-h with lithium tri(tert-butoxy)aluminum hydride afforded 3-hydroxymethyl derivatives 4a-h. For the synthesis of compound 4c, (5-chloro-6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanamine hydrochloride (7) was prepared starting from the (5-chloro-6-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanol 5 via Gabriel synthesis procedure (Scheme 2). To prepare compound 4d, (3-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)methan-d2-amine 9 was prepared using 3-chloro-4-methoxybenzonitrile 8 via a reduction reaction in presence of LiAlD4 (Scheme 2). Full experimental procedures are reported in Supplementary data.

The evaluation of the potency, selectivity, and metabolic stability of the newly synthesized compounds relied on a systematic, stepwise approach. Initially, all compounds were tested towards PDE5 inhibitory activity using an in vitro fluorescent enzymatic assay on human recombinant PDE5A1, with sildenafil and compound 7a as reference compounds (Table 2). Secondly, the most potent PDE5Is, showing an IC50 in the nano-molar range, were advanced toward an in vitro metabolic stability assay. Lastly, only compounds with the highest potency and microsomal stability were tested towards other PDE isoforms to establish their selectivity profile. Full experimental procedures are reported in Supplementary data. With respect to compound 7a, a trimethoxy benzene ring (4e) and a bulky aromatic ring (4g) caused a loss of the PDE5 inhibitory activity while the analog bearing the dioxolane-fused benzene ring (4f) was ~700-fold less potent (Table 3). The ethyl ester in lieu of the hydroxymethyl group (3b) produced a weakly active analog, highlighting the importance of the hydroxyl group for the interaction into the PDE5 binding site (23). The replacement of the benzene ring with a pyridin-4-yl ring (4a and 4h) negatively impacted the binding to the PDE5 enzyme. Specifically, the pyridin-4-yl analog with a chlorine substituent (4h) was ~4-fold less potent compared to the methoxy homolog (4a). By contrast, compounds with a pyridin-3-yl ring (4b and 4c) bearing either one or two substituents exhibited superior inhibitory activity compared to the pyridin-4-yl analogs. Lastly, the deuterated analog (4d) showed a minimal decreased of activity compared to compound 7a.

The purpose of our drug discovery program is to obtain more metabolically stable PDE5 inhibitors than compound 7a, while maintaining potency and selectivity towards other PDE isoforms. Based on the in vitro potency assay, the most potent derivatives 4a-d, 4f, and 4h were evaluated for human metabolic stability (Table 2) and the most stable compounds were also tested for selectivity towards other PDE isoforms (Table 3). The two deuterium atoms on the benzylic carbon in compound 4d failed to improve the in vitro human metabolic stability. In fact, compound 4d showed an in vitro human metabolic stability of 16.4 min comparable to compound 7a (t1/2 = 20.5 min). Even though the C–D bonds are shorter and at times more stable to oxidative processes (24), this modification did not increase the in vitro human metabolic stability. Metabolic stability of compounds 4a-c and 4h were assayed to evaluate the effect of the nitrogen position, and the presence of the methoxy and chlorine substituents on the pyridine scaffold. Compound 4c and 4h showed a human liver metabolic stability of 19.5 and 17.3 min, respectively, similarly to compound 7a. Surprisingly, we found that compound 4b (t1/2 = 44.6 min) was much more stable than compound 7a and 4a (t1/2 = 28.8min) with a half-life twice greater than that one of 7a. Additionally, an in vitro metabolite identification study of compounds 4b and 4c (Table 1) showed that compound 4b produces three metabolites, M1, M2 and M3 and only small amount of compound undergoes phase II glucuronidation reactions (M3 metabolite). Metabolite M1 is the most abundant metabolite and revealed the sensitivity of compound 4b to dehydrogenation reactions, which can occur at the hydroxymethyl group on the quinoline scaffold to generate an aldehyde or at the benzylic position to form an imine. Addition of an oxygen atom, which is likely to occur at one of the aromatic rings, provides metabolite M2. In vitro metabolic investigation of compound 4c (Table 1) reported four most abundant metabolites, M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. Metabolite M1 showed the sensitivity of compound 4c towards oxidation reactions, which can occur at positions 2’ and 4’ of the pyridine ring. Metabolite M2 showed sensitivity to de-methylation reactions at the methoxy group of the pyridine ring. Moreover, metabolite M3 generated from a double oxidation reaction, which could take place at one or both aromatic rings. Metabolite M4 may represent the product of oxidation reaction of the hydroxyl group into a carboxylic acid. Lastly metabolite M5 was identified as the product of glucuronidation reaction. This data could also suggest the limited presence of phase II reactions such as glucuronidation reaction. Furthermore, the difference in half-lives and metabolites between compounds 4b and 4c suggest a decisive role of chlorine in the stability (Table 1) and selectivity (shown below in table 3) of both molecules. Shah and colleagues observed that although organo-halogenates, such as organo-chlorines and organo-bromines, increase potency and selectivity, however can establish strong π-interactions with the cytochrome P450 isoform, CYP2B6. Among the human CYP enzymes, those of the CYP2B subfamily are involved in metabolizing numerous halogenated compounds including drugs (25). Based on these findings, it is possible that the presence of a chlorine atom makes compound 4c a suitable substrate for CYP2B6. Moreover, the metabolic profile of compound 4c showed the formation of an additional metabolite (M2) generated by the demethylation reaction of the methoxy group at the pyridine ring. Interestingly, such a metabolic biotransformation does not occur in compounds 4b and 7a, which also bear a methoxy group on the pyridine and benzene ring, respectively. It is plausible to believe that the electron-poor character of the pyridine ring, together with the electron withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom, weakens the O-CH3 bond, making the methoxy group of 4c more susceptible to a demethylation reaction.

Encouraged by these results, we tested compounds 4b for selectivity towards other PDE isoforms using compound 7a as a reference compound (Table 3). Compound 4b showed some interactions with PDE2 (IC50 = 180 nM, PDE2/PDE5= 9) and PDE6 isoforms (IC50 = 260 nM, PDE6/PDE5=13). Despite its low metabolic stability, we submitted compound 4c for PDE profiling to understand the effect of the chlorine atom on PDE2 and PDE6 inhibition. Interestingly, compound 4c exhibited low selectivity towards PDE6 enzyme (IC50 = 58 nM PDE6/PDE5=1.9) and no inhibitory activity towards the PDE2 isoform. These data suggest the involvement of the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring in reducing the selectivity towards PDE6 enzyme. Examining the structure–activity relationship for the methoxy and chlorine groups on the pyridine moiety, we can determine that a methoxy group in position 6’ is vitally important for the inhibitory activity on PDE5 enzyme. The chlorine atom in position 5’ of compound 4c (Table 3) seems to facilitate the selectivity towards the other PDE isoforms, but it is not crucial for increasing the microsomal stability.

Based on its potency and metabolic profile, compound 4b was moved into a functional assay aimed at evaluating its ability to strengthen synaptic transmissions. We carried out electrophysiology experiments to measure the compound’s effects on the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a type of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory, which is impaired by the elevation of oTau. Slices of the hippocampus were collected from 3- to 4-month-old wild-type (WT) mice and were treated either with vehicle (4% DMSO and 2% Tween in H2O), oTau (100nM through the bath perfusion for 20 min prior to the tetanus) or compound 4b (50 nM through the bath perfusion for 10 min prior to the tetanus). The presence of oTau dramatically reduces LTP. Potentiation was restored in compound-oTau treated WT mice (Fig. 1). The residual potentiation recorded in slices from WT mice treated with compound 4b and oTau was increased with respect to slice from WT perfused with oTau (Fig. 1B). Compound 4b did not have any effect on WT slices, consisting with the possibility that the inhibitor is acting on the LTP mechanisms underlying memory loss instead of a more generalized effect. Full experimental procedures are reported in Supplementary data. Thus, by acting on the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, compound 4b re-established the normal increase of synaptic strength in the hippocampus slice of WT mice perfused with oTau and 4b compound.

A new series of N-(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)quinoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for PDE5 inhibitory activity, selectivity, and in vitro microsomal stability. Compound 4b showed a good inhibitory activity on PDE5 enzyme and improved microsomal stability. Moreover, compound 4b ameliorated the deficit in LTP. Thus, compound 4b represents an important lead in the pharmacologic restoration of cell-to-cell communication and memory in AD. The discovery of compound 4b encourages us to pursue the drug optimization of this class of molecules.
