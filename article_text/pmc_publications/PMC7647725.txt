Non-fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers are considered as major neurotoxic species in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The presence of Aβ oligomers were shown to cause membrane disruptions in a broad range of model systems. However, the molecular basis of such disruption process remains unknown. We previously demonstrated that membrane-incorporated 40-residue Aβ (Aβ40) oligomers could form co-aggregates with phospholipids. This process occurred more rapidly than the fibrillization of Aβ40 and led to more severe membrane disruption. The present study probes the time-dependent changes in lipid dynamics, bilayer structures and peptide-lipid interactions along the time course of the oligomer-induced membrane disruption, using the solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Our results suggest the presence of certain intermediate states with phospholipid molecules entering the C-terminal hydrogen-bonding networks of the Aβ40 oligomeric cores. This work provides insights on the molecular mechanisms of Aβ40-oligomer-induced membrane disruption.

The long-lasting amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is being modified to include more pathological amyloidosis processes in addition to the fibrillization of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides1. Non-fibrillar Aβ oligomers are generally considered to have higher neurotoxicity comparing to fibrils2–4. The disruptions of cellular membranes induced by various types of Aβ aggregates were confirmed in many model systems from synthetic phospholipid bilayers to plasma membranes in living cells5–9, and therefore, have been proposed as viable neurotoxicity mechanisms10–12. However, the molecular basis of such membrane disruption processes, especially the molecular interactions between Aβ aggregates and essential membrane components such as phospholipids, cholesterol, etc., remains unclear. The understanding of such molecular basis will not only provide crucial insights on the pathology of AD, but also benefit the design of small compounds with membrane-active inhibition effects13. We previously showed that it was feasible to generate phospholipid bilayer model systems in which certain predominant Aβ40-induced membrane-disruption pathways could be selected14. For instance, a predominant fibrillization process could be selected when both Aβ40 concentrations and lipid-to-peptide molar ratios were kept low and membrane content leakage was shown to be the main disruption process along the fibril formation.

One of the model phospholipids (100% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)) with pre-incorporated Aβ40 peptides at high concentrations (&gt; 200 μM) and low lipid-to-peptide ratios (&lt; 1:30) led to the formation of non-fibrillar spherical oligomers14. Although the current work focuses on pure POPC bilayer, based on our previous studies, other essential membrane compositions, such as anionic phospholipids, cholesterol and gangliosides, have also been shown to affect the Aβ aggregation pathways15–17. As shown in Scheme 1, the protocol produced Aβ40 aggregates that were stabilized in 0.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The same treatment with detergent was shown to dissolve phospholipid bilayer but not affect mature Aβ40 fibrils18–20. Both negatively stained Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images confirmed that the final products contained predominant spherical aggregates, implying that the Aβ40 aggregates were off the pathway of fibril formation. The Series dilution of TEM samples (Figure S1) indicated that such spherical morphologies existed at original concentrations and maintained through dilution. Interestingly, the spherical oligomers seem to form larger amorphous and curvy filament-like aggregates at higher concentrations. We showed previously using confocal microscopy that most phospholipid vesicles were fragmentized in this system and the final aggregates had co-localizations of both Aβ40 and lipids14. Furthermore, solid-state NMR spectroscopy studies demonstrated that the final product had a rigid Aβ40 oligomeric core with parallel-β-sheets and molecular-level interactions between Aβ40 peptides and lipids (i.e. certain segments of peptides and lipids were within sub-nanometer distances)14,21. One question to be answered was what molecular interactions between Aβ40 and lipid molecules might contribute to the membrane fragmentation. The answers would provide insights on the molecular basis of this membrane disruption pathway. The fragmentation of lipid bilayers occurred within the first few hours’ incubation of the Aβ40-incorporated vesicles, more rapidly than the typical fibrillization process of Aβ40 in similar membrane environments21. However, the time scale (i.e. hours of incubation) was sufficiently slow for capturing possible intermediate states by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.

Using circular dichroism (CD) and static 31P NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1A–B), we showed that the bulk β-sheet structures of pre-incorporated Aβ40 was present at the beginning of incubation, while the 31P chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) patterns changed within the first four hours. Particularly, the static 31P spectra showed broadening of the CSA range and deviation from the typical pattern of symmetric uniaxial rotation of lipids at four hours comparing to the beginning, which indicated restrictions of the lipid headgroup motions over incubation, i.e. less efficient averaging of 31P CSA principle values. Quantitative analyses of lipid motions were done by analyzing the 31P spin-lattice (T1) and spin-spin (T2) relaxation (Table S1), which provided insights on the phospholipid lipid headgroup and diffusive motions as well as the curvature of lipid vesicles22. The T1 and T2 relaxation rates (R1 and R2 respectively) were obtained by fitting the corresponding curves to exponential decay functions (Figure S2). The fast and slow lipid motion correlation times (τf and τs respectively), which were dominated by the lipids’ headgroup rotational/wobbling motions and the lipids’ lateral diffusive motion respectively, were calculated by solving the following quadratic equations involving R1 and R2 using algorithms described in the literature23, (1) R1=215ω31P2σ2(1+η23)[S2τs1+(ω31Pτs)2+(1−S2)τf1+(ω31Pτf)2]

(2) R2=115ω31P2σ2(1+η23){[S2τs1+(ω31Pτs)2+(1−S2)τf1+(ω31Pτf)2]+43[s2τs+(1−S2)τf]}

, where ω31P, σ, η were the spectrometer frequency, the CSA and the asymmetric parameter of 31P respectively, and had the values 2π × 242 MHz, 160 ppm and 0.57. The order parameters S, varied between 0.15 and 0.22 for different samples, were estimated from the measurements of 13C-1H dipolar coupling using 13C-WISE (Wide Line SEparation) spectroscopy (Figure S1)24.

The relaxation measurements (Figure 1C–D, and Figure S2) were performed at four sample temperatures (275K, 285K, 295K and 305K, monitored by 1H chemical shifts in H2O) above the transition point of POPC (~ 270K). Figure 1E showed that the τs value decreased rapidly within the first hour of incubation, and gradually increased over the time course, indicating the instant enhancement of lipids’ diffusive motion upon incubation of pre-incorporated Aβ40. Linear fitting of the temperature-dependent of τs (Figure 1F and Table S1) showed that the activation energies for the diffusive motion increased with incubation, meaning that certain lipid molecules might be restricted from lateral movements over time. Analysis of the τf values provided insights on the uniaxial rotational and wobbling motions of phosphate headgroups25. The absolute values of τf varied between 1–2 ns within the first four hours (Figure 1G). Interestingly, the temperature-dependence of τf values showed a significant increment of activation energies within the first hour and remained large comparing to the initial value over the time course (Figure 1H), meaning that the headgroup motions of certain lipid molecules were quickly hindered upon the incorporation of Aβ40, presumably due to peptide-lipid interactions.

The motion that led to bending of alkyl chains in phospholipids was quantified using 1H-1H NOESY spectroscopy under magic angle spinning (MAS) conditions26. Such lipid dynamics enables the contacts between the methyl protons on the tails of alkyl chains of one lipid molecule (H3C) and the protons on the headgroup of the adjacent lipid molecule (αH and βH, Figure 2A), which generate inter-molecular 1H-1H NOESY cross peaks (Figure 2B)27. The integrations of these cross peaks were analyzed as the function of the NOESY mixing time, tm. The buildup curves of the cross peaks, Sij(tm), and the associated diagonal peaks, Sii(tm) were fit simultaneously to the following equations to obtain the cross-relaxation rates, σij, (3) Sii(tm)=Sii(0)2[1+exp(−2σijtm)]exp(−tmT)

(4) Sij(tm)=Sjj(0)2[1−exp(−2σijtm)]exp(−tmT)

, where the other fitting parameters Sii(0), Sjj(0) and T represented the initial intensities of diagonal and cross peaks, and the spin-lattice relaxation time constant that described the loss of magnetization at long mixing times respectively27,28.

Qualitatively, the build-up curves for both H3C-αH and H3C-βH cross peaks showed more rapid increment after one-hour incubation comparing to the initial system, and the buildups became slower after three-hour incubation (Figure 2C–D). This observation suggested the presence of an intermediate state in terms of the dynamics of lipid molecules upon incubation with the Aβ40 oligomers, which was consistent with the qualitative conclusion drawn from the 31P relaxation measurements. Quantitatively, as shown in Figure 2E, the cross-relaxation rates increased from the initial ~ 0.2 s−1 to ~ 0.7 s−1 after two-hour incubation and dropped to ~ 0.3 s−1 after four hours. It was shown previously that the cross-relaxation rate measured by NOESY spectroscopy reflected the lateral organization of bilayers and particularly the nearest-neighbor contacts between lipid molecules29. The lateral diffusion of lipids, probed by the slow-motion correlation time (τs) of 31P, also showed significant decrements between one-hour and three-hour incubation time, meaning that the lateral diffusive motions were greatly promoted within this time. This change may consequently lead to closer organization (i.e. packing) between lipid molecules, which attributed to the instant increments in cross-relaxation rates.

Overall, the three sets of quantitative analyses on lipids’ molecular dynamics revealed the presence of a rapid change of phospholipids’ molecular motions upon incubation of Aβ40 oligomers. The lateral motion of lipids was enhanced, featured by shortened slow-motion correlation times and increased cross-relaxation rates. Within the same time period, the lipid headgroup motions became more restricted (measurements of fast-motion correlation times τf), presumably because of the stronger molecular interactions with the Aβ40 oligomeric constructs. To further illustrate such molecular interactions between lipids and Aβ40, we applied the 31P-PITHIRDs-CT30 and 13C-31P Rotational-Echo Double-Resonance (REDOR)25,31,32 spectroscopy on samples with different incubation times. The 31P-PITHIRDs-CT spectroscopy probed the 31P-31P proximities within the bilayer and therefore semi-quantitatively reflected the organization of phospholipid molecules. Simulations were performed on a four-31P-spin system with square geometry, which mimicked the two-dimensional arrangement of 31P nuclei on the bilayer surface (Figure 3A). The results showed that the 31P signal decayed to ~ 60% within 15 ms dipolar evolution time when the 31P-31P distance was 8.0 Å, which was roughly the proximity of adjacent phospholipid headgroups in the intact bilayers shown by computational simulations33. Given the high sensitivity of natural abundance 31P spectroscopy, the 31P-PITHIRDs-CT provides a fast approach to probe the changes in averaged 31P-31P proximities in lipid bilayers.

As shown in Figure 3B, the initial PITHIRDs decay curve fit well to 7.5–8.0 Å 31P-31P distance, which agreed with the reported spacing between the phosphate headgroups in intact lipid bilayers33,34. The proximities between 31Ps became shorter with longer incubation times and was &lt; 7.0 Å at four hours. The changes in the averaged 31P-31P did not necessarily reflect closer proximities in terms of the lipid headgroup spacing in the entire bilayer. Instead, it might suggest that certain lipid molecules adopted closer distances which consequently caused the decrease of the averaged proximity for the ensembles. We then performed 31P-detected 13C-31P REDOR measurements to detect different populations of lipid molecules in terms their proximities to the Aβ40. We showed previously that the residues G25 ang V36 had close contact to the lipid 31Ps in the final co-aggregates14. Therefore, the current 31P-detected REDOR measurements utilized Aβ40 with 13C isotope labeling at these two residues. In addition, samples with different incubation times from zero to four hours were pellet down by ultracentrifuge and then washed with 0.3% SDS to remove lipids that were not associated with the Aβ40 oligomeric core. This procedure ensured the detection of the 31P signal reduction due to the 13C-31P contact. Figure 3C showed the 31P-detected REDOR spectra at 24 ms 13C-31P dipolar evolution time, which was long enough to measure 13C-31P contact within ~ 8.0 Å. The 31P signal did not decay at the beginning of incubation (i.e. time zero), suggesting that few lipids were located within sub-nanometer proximities to Aβ40. The 31P decay became more significant with longer incubation time. For instance, ~ 6% and 10% 31P decays were observed at three-hour and four-hour incubation, respectively, meaning that more lipid molecules became closely associated to Aβ40 over time through molecular interactions involving the lipid headgroups. This observation was consistent with the increasing of the fast-motion correlation time (τf) of 31P, which indicted the restriction of headgroup motions that might be caused by stronger Aβ40-lipid interactions. The 31P REDOR dephasing curves were plotted in Figure 3D. Qualitatively, the buildup curves with longer incubation times (e.g. three and four hours) indicated that the fraction of lipids with close proximities to Aβ40 increased. Since the REDOR dephasing is dominated by the shortest internuclear distances (and strongest heteronuclear dipolar couplings) in the systems, the buildup curves also suggested that the closest proximities between Aβ40 and lipid molecules did not change significantly with longer incubation. Only the populations of lipid molecules that had close contact to Aβ40 became larger over time.

Lastly, we investigated the site-specific Aβ40 oligomer chain assemblies and lipid-peptide interactions within the same time course (i.e. zero to four hours) using 13C-PITHIRDs-CT and 13C-detected 13C-31P REDOR spectroscopy. Three sites, A21, G25 and V36, were chosen because we previously showed that G25 and V36 had close contacts to 31Ps in the final aggregates while A21 was far away14. In addition, these three residues located within the N-terminal β-strand, the loop, and the C-terminal β-strand segments of the Aβ40 oligomeric core respectively14,21. Figure 4A–C showed that the PITHIRDs decay curves for neither A21 nor V36 changed over time. Both residues maintained parallel-β-sheets with ~ 5 Å inter-strand distances (Figure S3). However, the inter-strand distances at G25 increased with incubation time, from ~ 5 Å at time zero to &gt; 7 Å at four hours (Figure S3). Figure 4D–F showed the representative REDOR spectra for these three residues and Figure 4G–I plotted the time evolution of REDOR dephasing curves. The residue A21 showed little dephasing at all time points and G25 showed fast REDOR buildup curves with two-hour and longer incubation periods. Interestingly, residue V36 also possessed time-dependent changes in the REDOR buildup curves (and therefore, time-dependent proximities between lipid headgroup and this site). However, the fast REDOR buildup curves appeared at longer incubation times (e.g. 4 hours) comparing to G25. Quantitatively, most 13C-31P REDOR buildup curves with fast decays (i.e. strong dipolar coupling and short 13C-31P distances) for G25 and V36 fit to ~ 5.7 – 6.3 Å distances (Figure S4). The distances were closer than the expected proximities between the lipid headgroup 31Ps and the peptide backbone 13Cs if the lipid molecules were located outside of the Aβ40 oligomeric core because of the intrinsic volumes of lipid headgroups and peptide side chains. Therefore, some lipid molecules might enter the β-sheet assemblies by breaking parts of the hydrogen-bonding network. In this case, the lipid headgroups had direct contacts with the peptide backbone. Fitting of the REDOR data also showed that although the best-fit 13C-31P distances did not change significantly, the population of 13Cs that had close contact with 31Ps did increase over time.

This finding, as well as the previous 31P-detected REDOR results that showed the time-dependent increments of the peptide-contacting lipid populations, raised a model of Aβ40-lipid interaction process (Figure 4J): Starting from the molecular interactions between the loop segments of the Aβ40 oligomer cores and the lipid phosphate headgroups, more lipid molecules might insert into the intermolecular assembling of the loop segments, forming an intercalated architecture between Aβ40 and lipids. This might further lead to interruptions of the C-terminal hydrogen-bonding network and more insertion of lipid molecules into the β-sheets. The Aβ40 oligomer core eventually formed localized β sheets with smaller number of assembled β-strands, similar to the scenarios described in previous computational simulations35–39. This model explained the 13C-PITHIRDs results at V36: Although the bulk C-terminal β-sheets network broke, there was no change in the 13C signal decay because the PITHIRDs decay curves were determined by the shortest 13C-13C inter-strand distances (i.e. the strongest dipolar coupling). In addition, the 13C-detected REDOR dephasing at V36 only reached ~ 25% (instead of 100% for an ideal 13C-31P two-spin model) because a large population of 13Cs were shielded from the lipid phosphate groups by the localized β sheets.

In the present work, we probed the early-stage phospholipid dynamics and peptide-lipid interactions in a POPC model bilayer with pre-incorporated Aβ40 oligomers, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Our findings contributed to the understanding of molecular structures and interactions in intermediate states of the amyloidosis process of Aβ. A number of recent studies have been done to develop novel model systems and/or high-resolution NMR spectroscopic methods to address these pathologically important questions. For instance, the peptidic- and lipid-nanodiscs have been shown to be useful to trap Aβ40 intermediates40,41. In addition, proton-detected MAS- and Dynamic-Nuclear-Polarization-(DNP)-based solid-state NMR approaches have been applied to probe early events in Aβ aggregation process42,43. In the pure POPC bilayer model system, the present work indicated that within four hours’ incubation at physiological conditions, the bilayer showed considerable changes in terms of the lipid motions and the overall organizations. Particularly, the lipid headgroup motions were restricted with closer proximities between lipid molecules and stronger lipid-Aβ40 interactions. Within the same time scale, molecular-level changes occurred to the architecture of Aβ40 oligomer cores. The inter-strand interactions in the loop and C-terminal β-sheets segments were weakened, and a population of lipid molecules might insert into the oligomers’ hydrogen-bonding networks to form co-aggregates with intercalated cores. This process might consequently weaken the interactions between lipids and eventually led to fragmentation of bilayers14,44–47. Although not been explored in the present work, other biologically relevant membrane compositions, including negatively charged phospholipids, cholesterol and gangliosides, are expected to contribute to the proposed early-stage membrane-disruption mechanism. For instance, we showed that the interactions between the loop segments of Aβ and the lipid headgroups were critical to the oligomer-induced early-stage membrane disruption. Such interactions may involve charged side chains in loop residues, which could be further strengthened by the negatively charged phospholipids. Cholesterol is an essential composition in neuronal plasma membranes48. Its overall population as well as the distributions in the inner and outer leaflets of bilayers were shown to change along the progress of AD49. The incorporation of cholesterol is known to increase the rigidity of liquid-phase phospholipid bilayers48. The current work showed that both the lateral diffusive motion and the cross-relaxation rates of phospholipids were significantly enhanced by the initial incorporation of Aβ40 oligomers. Such effects may be impeded by increased population of cholesterol. In addition, gangliosides were shown to interact specifically to membrane-bound Aβ and the Aβ oligomers strongly disrupted ganglioside-containing model bilayers47,50. It is possible that the gangliosides, which contain more reactive headgroups, may facilitate the early-stage interactions between lipids and the polar loop segments of Aβ.
