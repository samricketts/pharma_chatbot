Background and purpose:

Motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia syndrome characterized by cognitive complaints and slow gait. MCR is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. Predictors of transition to dementia in MCR patients are still obscure.

Methods:

We examined clinical, biological and lifestyle parameters related to conversion to dementia using Cox models in 439 older adults with prevalent MCR (mean age 79.87 ± 8.13 years, 70% women) from two cohorts, 268 from the Chicago-based Rush Memory and Aging project (MAP) and 171 from the Religious Orders Study (ROS), which enrolled religious clergy across the United States.

Results:

In the pooled sample, 439 (13.2%) had prevalent MCR (268 MAP and 171 ROS). There were 140 (31.9%) incident dementia cases over a median follow up of 4.0 years. Age predicted conversion from MCR to dementia in both cohorts. Male gender was a risk factor only in ROS. In the pooled data, only higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher risk of conversion to dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24). Lower cognitive activity participation (aHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.79) and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (aHR 2.57, 95% CI 1.48–4.45) predicted conversion to dementia in MAP.

Conclusions:

Depressive symptoms and other cohort-specific risk factors were identified as predictors of transition to dementia in individuals with MCR. These findings suggest common pathological mechanisms underlying mood, gait and cognitive declines in aging, which could help develop preventive strategies.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The motoric cognitive risk syndrome (MCR) is a predementia syndrome characterized by the presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait [1]. The prevalence of MCR is between 2% and 27% in populations worldwide [2]. MCR is associated with increased risk of incident cognitive impairment and dementia [3].

The sole distinction in operational criteria in diagnosing MCR from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [4] is substituting a slow gait criterion in MCR for the cognitive test deficit criterion in MCI. There is only modest clinical overlap between these two predementia syndromes [5], and both syndromes are associated with unique risk factors [6]. Older age, lower education, depressive symptoms, vascular risk factors and presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele have been reported to increase risk of conversion to dementia in MCI patients [7–9]. In contrast, only a few studies have investigated this question in MCR. A recent multicenter study found that cognitive (cognitive complaints and cognitive tests) but not motoric domains (gait velocity) predicted transition from MCR to dementia [10]. While risk factors for incident MCR such as age, sex, education, obesity, physical inactivity, depressive symptoms and cardiovascular diseases have been reported [11], risk factors for conversion from MCR to dementia are not yet established.

To address this knowledge gap, we examined risk factors that may be associated with conversion to dementia in individuals with MCR in two prospective cohort studies. We hypothesized that distinct clinical, biological and lifestyle parameters would predict conversion from MCR to dementia. Establishing risk factors for conversion to dementia in MCR patients could help guide development of preventive interventions.

METHODS

Study population

This MCR study included individual data from participants from two established aging studies in the United States: the Rush Memory and Aging project (MAP), and the Religious Orders Study (ROS) [12–14]. Individual study goals and design have been published. In brief, the Chicago-based MAP is a clinical-pathologic study of chronic conditions of aging (mean age 79.7 years, 74% women, 93% Caucasian, 6% African-American) [13]. The ROS enrolled religious clergy aged 55 years and older from more than 40 groups across the United States (mean age 76.0 years, 71% women, 92% Caucasian, 7% African-American) [14]. Baseline data were collected from 1994 to 2018 in the two cohorts, and follow-up ranged up to 23 years. Both cohorts contained information at baseline and annual follow-up visits on cognitive complaints, cognitive tests, gait speed and dementia. After exclusions for missing data and individuals aged under 60 years, the eligible sample included 3314 individuals aged 60 years and older, of whom 439 (13.2%) participants had MCR at baseline, and were included in the current analysis.

Both MAP and ROS study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Rush University Medical Center. All participants signed an informed consent and a repository consent allowing their data to be shared. The IRB of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine approved this analysis.

MCR and dementia diagnosis

Motoric cognitive risk syndrome diagnosis is defined as presence of cognitive complaints and slow gait in older individuals with preserved activities of daily living and without dementia [1]. Cognitive complaints from participants were recorded by interviewers based on positive responses to the following two questions that were common to the two cohorts: “trouble remembering?” and “if memory was worse than 10 years ago?” [15]. Positive responses to both questions were “very often,” “often” and “sometimes.” Gait speed (cm/sec) at normal pace was timed over a fixed distance from a standing start and converted to speed (cm/sec) in the MAP and ROS cohorts [12]. Slow gait was defined as walking speed one standard deviation below age and sex-specific means in each cohort to overcome variability between cohorts [1]. The same MCR diagnosis procedures were applied in previous reports in these two cohorts [1].

The MAP and ROS cohorts used a computer-based system of prediction rules to guide clinical judgment for the diagnosis of MCI, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to improve uniformity of decision making over time and space [16]. Good agreement between clinical dementia diagnoses and pathological findings was reported in these cohorts [13,14].

Predictors

We selected demographic, medical illnesses, mood, lifestyle and genetic variables as predictors of transition to dementia based on data availability in the cohorts as well as previously reported associations of these variables with risk of developing MCR [1] or those reported as predictors of transition to dementia in MCI [8].

Demographic and anthropometric predictors

Age in years was computed from self-reported date of birth. Education (reported as years of education) was obtained at the time of the baseline cognitive testing. Sex was recorded at the baseline interview. Weight and height were measured and recorded at each visit and used to calculate body mass index (BMI) [17]. BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥30.

Vascular risk factors and other medical conditions

Self-reported smoking history (ever) and heart attacks were rated as absent or present (0 or 1). Hypertension and diabetes were rated as present if the participant reported having been diagnosed with the condition by a physician or were on medication for the condition [18,19]. Stroke was diagnosed based on self-report plus clinical examination, as previously described [20]. Head injury with loss of consciousness and thyroid disease were rated as absent or present (0 or 1) [21]. Clinical depression was diagnosed based on a clinical interview by the examining physician, as previously described [22].

Mood and lifestyle variables

Depressive symptoms were assessed with a modified, 10-item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) [23]. Participants were asked whether or not they experienced each of 10 symptoms much of the time in the past week. The score was the total number of symptoms experienced. Items 4 and 7 were reverse coded so the response was consistent with depressive symptom = 1.

Physical activity (five items) was assessed using questions adapted from the 1985 National Health Interview Survey [24]. The variable measured the sum of hours per week that the participant engaged in five categories of activities: walking for exercise, gardening or yard work, calisthenics or general exercise, bicycle riding (including stationary bikes), swimming or water exercises. Participants were asked if they had engaged in any of the five activities within the past 2 weeks and, if so, the number of occasions and average minutes per occasion. Minutes reported for each activity were summed and divided by 120 to yield a composite measure of participation in physical activity expressed as hours per week. Late life cognitive activity is a composite measure of frequency of participation in seven cognitively stimulating activities during the past year [25,26]. We examined cognitive activities only in MAP as the individual items showed only minor overlap between the cohorts. Activities included reading, writing letters, visiting a library, and playing games such as chess or checkers. Participants were asked to rate each item on a five-point scale. Values for items 2–7 were flipped so that higher values indicated more frequent participation. The variable ranged from 1 to 5, and was calculated by averaging the individual item scores. The variable was calculated if at least half of the items were non-missing.

Genetic

APOE allele determination was done as previously reported [27]. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and genotyping was performed by Agencourt Bioscience Corporation (Beverly, MA) utilizing high throughput sequencing of codon 112 (position 3937) and codon 158 (position 4075) of exon 4 of the APOE gene on chromosome 19. Participants with one or more alleles for ε4 (i.e., ε3, ε4, ε2, ε4, ε4, ε4) were considered positive for ε4 allele for these analyses. All other participants with other allele combinations (i.e., ε2, ε2, ε2, ε3 or ε3, ε3) were considered negative for ε4 allele [27].

Statistical analysis

Results were reported for individual cohorts and pooling samples using meta-analysis. Date of the baseline clinical examination was that at which the gait measures were first collected. The onset of dementia was assigned at the follow-up visit at which criteria were met. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute hazard ratios adjusted for age and sex (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the selected risk factors for developing incident dementia. Proportional hazards assumptions were examined graphically and analytically, and were adequately met for all variables. We conducted Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for age and sex, for each cohort separately, and obtained an overall effect using meta-analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to account for diagnostic misclassification of early dementia as MCR by excluding incident dementia cases occurring within the first year of follow-up. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Demographic and clinical data of MCR patients in MAP and ROS cohorts

The MAP and ROS cohorts’ baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. There were 439 (13.2%) individuals with prevalent MCR, 268 in MAP and 171 in ROS. The ages of the 439 MCR participants ranged from 62 to 98 years, with 64% women. Mean education level was 14.8 years. Education level was higher in ROS (17.5 years) than in MAP (13.8 years). There was a higher prevalence of smoking among MAP participants (45% vs. 20%). Other parameters were similar between the two cohorts. Over a median follow-up of 2.9 years, 140 (31.9%) individuals in the pooled MCR sample developed dementia, 68 in MAP and 72 in ROS. The percentage of incident dementia cases was higher in ROS (42.1%) than MAP (25%) due to the longer follow up time in ROS.

Age was a risk factor for conversion to dementia in both cohorts (aHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.13 in MAP and aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.09–1.17 in ROS). Male gender was associated with reduced risk for conversion only in the ROS (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34–0.93). Education was not significant in both cohorts.

Risk factors for MCR transition to incident dementia

Table 2 presents results of the Cox models for the selected variables. Higher depressive symptoms (CES-D) was associated with higher risk of conversion to dementia in the MAP cohort and the pooled data (aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00–1.27 and aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24, respectively). Cognitive activity was associated with reduced risk of dementia in MAP (aHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44–0.79). All other parameters including physical activity, smoking, number of medications, obesity and BMI were not associated with increased risk of conversion to dementia. No association was found between vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and stroke and the risk of dementia conversion in MCR (Table 2). Presence of APOE ε4 variants was associated with risk of conversion to dementia only in MAP (aHR 2.58, 95% CI 1.49–4.46).

Figure 1 graphically shows the estimates (log of hazard ratios) for the association of the selected parameters with risk of incident dementia in MCR cases. Results are presented for individual studies as well as in the pooled sample. High heterogeneity is noted (I2 statistic 75%) for the pooled sample. Only depressive symptoms showed a significant association with incident dementia in the combined data. APOE ε4 was associated with incident dementia only in the MAP cohort.

Sensitivity analyses

We excluded incident dementia cases diagnosed in the first year of follow-up to account for MCR cases that reverted back to normal or dementia cases that may have been misclassified as normal or MCR at baseline (13 in MAP and 16 in ROS). After excluding these cases, APOE ε4 (aHR 2.70, 95% CI 1.45–5.01, p = 0.002), participation in cognitive activities (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46–0.90, p = 0.010) and CES-D scores (aHR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05–1.37, p = 0.007) remained significant predictors in MAP. All risk factors examined in ROS remained not significant consistent with the main findings.

DISCUSSION

In this study we investigated the risk factors associated with dementia conversion in 439 persons with MCR from two well-established aging cohorts. Older age and depressive symptoms were associated with higher rate of conversion to dementia in both cohorts. Cognitive activity participation and APOE ε4 allele was associated with dementia conversion only in the MAP cohort. This difference between the two cohorts may be attributed to the diversity in population characteristics (older age, more women and lower educational attainment in MAP) or the relatively small number and follow-up years of those that meet MCR criteria. Medical illnesses, medication counts, vascular risk factors and physical activity were not associated with risk of conversion to dementia in MCR patients.

Depressive symptoms

Depressive symptoms are common to patients with MCR and major depression. Depressive symptoms were associated with incidence of dementia in MCR. Depression in old age is related to cognitive decline and dementia, and may be an early clinical manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases or vascular brain diseases [28]. Several retrospective case-control and longitudinal studies showed an association between history of depression and risk of AD [29,30]. The CES-D scale scores used in our study has been linked to risk of AD and more rapid cognitive decline [31]. In MCI, presence of depressive symptoms increases the rate of conversion to AD and dementia [32]. In 243 MCI cases from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), those with persistent depressive symptoms had higher conversion to AD compared to those without neuropsychiatric symptoms over a 2-year follow up [33]. In a recent study of 1101 MCI patients followed up for 6.9 years, presence of three or more depressive symptoms predicted conversion to dementia [9]

Several large-scale studies including thousands of patients found an association between depression and anxiety and the risk of MCR [6,34]. The use of antidepressive medications was associated with presence of MCR [35] Increased level of depressive symptoms was associated with worse performance in gait variables including velocity, stride and swing time variability in older adults [36]. These gait disturbances were also common in patients with MCR [37]. Our study is the first to show that, similar to MCI, MCR patients with depressive symptoms are at higher risk of conversion to dementia. This observation may have practical intervention possibilities.

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the association between depressive symptoms and progression to dementia in MCR as well as in MCI is not fully understood. In cross-sectional studies, depressed elderly had brain changes associated with AD and dementia, including reduced frontal, temporal lobe, hippocampal and amygdala volume [38]. Individuals with MCI and comorbid depressive symptoms had more frontal, parietal and temporal white matter atrophy compared to asymptomatic patients [33]. Reduction of brain volumes in supplementary motor, insular and prefrontal cortex regions in MCR was reported [3,39]. The authors concluded that MCR was primarily associated with gray matter atrophy in brain regions linked to the control aspects of gait such as motor planning and modulation; however, these areas were also linked to late life depression [40]. The common involvement of brain areas by MCR and depression-related pathologies might increase their susceptibility to deteriorate to dementia.

APOE

The APOE ε4 allele is the main genetic risk factor for late-onset cognitive decline and AD [41]. Most studies have supported the notion that APOE ε4 is a risk factor for conversion from MCI to AD [42,43], whereas others disagree and attribute the effect to the duration of MCI diagnosis [44]. Presence of APOE ε4 allele has been linked to accelerated motor decline and cognitive impairment in aging [45,46]. APOE ε4 allele was associated with conversion of MCR to dementia in the MAP cohort.

Education and cognitive activity

Epidemiological studies have indicated that lifelong cognitively stimulating experiences, including education and occupation and leisure activities, were linked to improved late-life cognition, reduced risk of cognitive decline and lower incidence of MCI and AD [47,48]. Lower education has been identified in meta-analyses as a strong predictor of MCI [49], but not of conversion from MCI to dementia [50]. As with MCI [50], education was not associated with further conversion from MCR to dementia in MAP or ROS. Interestingly, MCR patients in MAP who were cognitively active were less likely to convert to dementia than those who were cognitively less active. It is possible that the protective effect of higher education or cognitive activities on brain reserve influences the risk of getting MCI or MCR, but once the patients reach this level, they lose this protective effect. Further study is required.

Vascular risk factors and physical activity

Hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and physical inactivity and sedentariness are risk factors for MCR [6], but none predicted conversion to dementia. Our findings suggest that these risk factors are important in determining who will develop MCR among healthy elderly, but not who will deteriorate further to dementia. This finding emphasizes the importance of treating these modifiable risk factors as early as possible in order to prevent reaching the MCR stage. A future direction is to examine if imaging evidence of silent cerebrovascular disease may influence dementia conversion in MCR.

Study limitations

Our study had several limitations. The MAP and ROS cohorts were mainly white, and our findings need to be explored in other populations. Our samples, especially the ROS, were highly educated, and our findings should be tested in more diverse samples. However, other published findings regarding dementia risk from these two well-established cohorts were generalizable to other cohorts worldwide [29,36]. Slow gait is multifactorial, and we did not attempt to distinguish underlying causes. The slow gait MCR criterion is applied regardless of etiology, and was shown to predict dementia in multiple studies [1,2]. This is similar to how the objective cognitive impairment criterion is applied regardless of etiology in MCI. Furthermore, we reported that presence of neurological or non-neurological gait abnormalities in MCR does not predict further cognitive decline [37]. Interestingly, gait speed in MCR also does not predict conversion to dementia, suggesting that slow gait in individuals with cognitive complaints places individuals at a high risk for dementia state but further cognitive worsening is dependent on other risk factors as seen in this study. As with any retrospective analysis, the investigation was limited to data already collected. Our selected risk factors are not meant to be an exhaustive list but cover those that are potentially modifiable. Our findings could guide future studies of other biological and clinical risk factors that may influence dementia pathogenesis in MCR patients.

CONCLUSIONS

Depressive symptoms were an important predictor of conversion to dementia among MCR patients in our study, suggesting common mechanisms between neuropsychiatric disturbances, gait abnormalities and cognitive deterioration in aging. APOE ε4 and reduced cognitive activity were risk factors in one cohort. Other risk factors seem to be important in the pathogenesis of MCR but not in the conversion from MCR to dementia. Our work promotes the need for early intervention of these modifiable risk factors in order to prevent further deterioration in patients with MCR.
