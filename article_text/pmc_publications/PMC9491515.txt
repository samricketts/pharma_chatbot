Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than 1 in 9 people age 65 and older and becomes an urgent public health concern as the global population ages. Tau tangle is the specific protein pathological hallmark of AD and plays a crucial role in leading to dementia-related structural deformations observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The volume loss of hippocampus is mainly related to the development of AD. Besides, apolipoprotein E (APOE) also has significant effects on the risk of developing AD. However, few studies focus on integrating genotypes, MRI, and tau deposition to infer multimodal relationships. In this paper, we proposed a federated chow test model to study the synergistic effects of APOE and tau on hippocampal morphometry. Our experimental results demonstrate our model can detect the difference of tau deposition and hippocampal atrophy among the cohorts with different genotypes and subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) were identified as hippocampal subregions where atrophy is strongly associated with abnormal tau in the homozygote cohort. Our model will provide novel insight into the neural mechanisms about the individual impact of APOE and tau deposition on brain imaging.

pmc1. INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now viewed as a gradual process that begins many years before clinical symptoms. Measuring brain biomarkers and intervening at the preclinical or earlier stages of AD improve the probability of therapeutic success [1]. Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and tau tangles are the two specific protein pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and play crucial roles in leading to dementia-related structural deformations observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans [2]. In the A/T/N system, a recently proposed research framework for understanding the biology of AD, the presence of abnormal levels of tau in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is used to define the presence of biological Alzheimer’s disease [1]. An imbalance between production and clearance of Aβ occurs early in AD and is typically followed by the accumulation of tau protein tangles with increasingly severe atrophy and neurodegeneration detectable on brain MRI scans [1], [3]. In particular, the hippocampus is a primary target region across the spectrum from clinically normal to dementia [4], [5].

Additionally, mounting evidence suggests that germline mutations (e.g., DNA SNPs) play an important role in AD etiology and progression [1]. People with a parent or sibling with AD are more likely to develop the disease. The gene with the strongest association to AD is apolipoprotein E (APOE) and the e4 allele is associated with increased risk, whereas the e2 allele is associated with decreased risk. The odds ratios (ORs) for developing AD are 3.2 for individuals with one e4 allele and 14.9 with two e4 alleles, but only 0.6 with one e2 allele, when compared with individuals with two common e3 alleles in Caucasians [6]. Besides, progressive tau accumulation is more prominent in e4 carriers [7].

Integrating data from multiple sites and sources are common practice to achieve larger sample sizes and increase the statistical power. However, different institutions may not be readily able to share biomedical research data due to patient privacy concerns, data restrictions based on patient consent or institutional review board (IRB) regulations, and legal complexities, which can present a major obstacle to pooling large scale datasets to discover and understand AD-related factors. To remedy this distributed problem, a large-scale collaborative network, ENIGMA consortium, was built [8]. However, most ENIGMA meta-analytic studies currently focus on univariate measures derived from brain MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalogram, or other data modalities, and relatively few have integrated genetics, MRI, and PET data to infer multimodal relationships.

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a federated model based on chow test [9] to study the association between imaging biomarkers and tau deposition in the cohorts with different APOE genotypes. The intuition of our multi-omics approach is illustrated in Fig. 1. The image-tau relationship (correlation) is diluted when the population is mixed, but when we stratify the population based on their genotypes, we can observe strong correlations (AA and BB groups) across subgroups. In this study, we randomly assign the subjects to five hypothesis institutions. And these samples are first stratified into three cohorts according to their APOE genotypes, including non-carriers (NC), heterozygote subjects (HT) and homozygote subjects (HM). Then, we use our federated chow test model to explore the correlations between the measure for tau deposition (Braak34) and imaging biomarkers. In the chow test model, each imaging biomarker is used as the predicter and the measure for tau is used as the response as shown in Fig. 2. In our experiments, we first adopt the widely used hippocampal volume as the imaging biomarker in our model. And then, we further apply two morphometry features as the imaging biomarker, radial distance and surface tensor-based morphometry, to figure out the regions where the atrophy focuses on the hippocampal surface. We hypothesis our model can detect the difference of tau deposition and hippocampal atrophy among the cohorts with different genotypes and extract the AD-related regions on the hippocampal surface.

2. DATA DESCRIPTION

Data for testing the performance of our proposed framework and comparable methods were obtained from the publicly available ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI is the result of efforts by many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations. Subjects are recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. From ADNI 1, ADNI 2, ADNI GO, and ADNI 3 (the different phases of ADNI), we obtained 847 pairs of MRI scans and AV1451 PET images, including 502 non-carriers (NC), 281 heterozygote subjects (HT) and 64 homozygote subjects (HM). Table 1 shows the demographic information from the cohort that we analyzed. The PET images are reprocessed using a single pipeline consistent with the work of Sanchez et al.[10], so the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from different ADNI study sites can be analyzed together. In this work, we analyze tau deposition in a brain region named Braak34 [11].

3. METHOD

3.1 Morphometry Features

Using the FIRST algorithm from the FMRIB Software Library (FSL), hippocampal structures are segmented in the MNI152 standard space [12]. Surface meshes are constructed based on the hippocampal segmentations with the marching cubes algorithm [13] and a topology-preserving level set method [14]. Then, surface smoothing is applied consistently to all surfaces to reduce the noise from MR image scanning and overcome partial volume effects [15]. With the holomorphic flow segmentation method [16], each hippocampal surface is parameterized with refined triangular meshes. The parameterized surfaces are then registered to a standard rectangular grid template using a surface fluid registration algorithm [17].

After parameterization and registration, we establish a one-to-one correspondence map between hippocampal surfaces. Each surface has the same number of vertices ( 150 × 100 ). At each vertex, we adopt two kinds of morphometry features, the radial distance (RD) [18] and measures derived from surface tensor-based morphometry (TBM) [19]. The RD (a scalar at each vertex) represents the thickness of the shape at each vertex relative to the medial axis; this primarily reflects surface differences along the surface normal directions. The medial axis is determined by the geometric center of the isoparametric curve on the computed conformal grid [20]. The thickness can be easily calculated as the Euclidean distance between the core and the vertex on the curve as the axis is perpendicular to the isoparametric curve. TBM examines the Jacobian matrix J of the deformation map that registers the surface to a template surface [17]. For TBM, det(J) was computed at each vertex, and this value reflects how the surface area changed around the vertex (expansion or atrophy). Additionally, we used the heat kernel smoothing algorithm [21] to refine the surface features. Finally, the surface of the hippocampus in each brain hemisphere has 15,000 vertices and each vertex has one RD and one TBM.

3.2 Federated Chow Test

Chow test [9] determines whether correlation coefficients estimated in two or three subgroups are significantly different. Although the Chow test is commonly used in the financial industry, it is not widely used in the biomedical field. Briefly, we first partition all the samples into three subgroups according to the subject’s genotype at specific SNP loci or a gene (e.g., stratified by the three APOE genotypes). For each group, g, we calculate the linear regression equation as, y[g] = X[g]w[g] + ϵ[g], where X[g]∈RN[g]×k is the independent variable, y[g]∈RN[g] is a vector of the observations on a dependent variable, wg is the coefficient vector, and ϵ[g]∈RN[g] is the disturbance vector. In our case, X[g] represents the features on one of vertices of the surface and y[g] is the corresponding measure for tau deposition.

The Chow test assumes the errors ϵ are independent and identically distributed from a normal distribution by an unknown variance. The null hypothesis of the Chow test asserts that w[1]¯, w[2]¯, and w[3]¯ are equal. The predictive test suggested by Chow is then: (1) F=(S[c]−(S[1]+S[2]+S[3]))/(2k)(S[1]+S[2]+S[3])/(N[1]+N[2]+N[3]−3k),

where S[C] is the sum of squared residuals from the combined data of the three subgroups, S[1] is the sum of squared residuals from the first group, and so on for S[2] and S[3]. N[1], N[2], and N[3] are the number of samples in each subgroup, and k is the number of parameters. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic follows the F-distribution with 2k and N[1] + N[2] + N[3] − 3k degrees of freedom. The global center will calculate F by gathering all the least square loss and the number of subjects for each subgroup and combined data from each institution. For example, for the first subgroup, the global least-square loss is S[1]=∑i=1ISi[1] and the global subject number is N[1]=∑i=1INi[1]. Eventually, the p-value will be calculated at the global center and assigned to each institution.

The subject number may not leak the patients’ information, but the linear regression may have the privacy concern. Therefore, we use the following federated strategy to calculate the global least-square loss for each group. We omit the group superscripts as the federated regression models for each subgroup are the same. Then, the coefficient vector w can be estimated by minimizing the least squared function, S(w)=12‖Xw−y‖22. To avoid centralizing the data, (Xi, yi), from each institution, we first rewrite the minimization problem as, minw∑i=1ISi(w;Xi,yi)=12∑i=1I‖Xiw−yi‖22. Then, the global gradient can be calculated as, ∇S(w)=XT(Xw−y)=∑i=1IXiT(Xiw−yi)=∑i=1I∇Si(w). In this way, instead of centralizing the data, the global center only needs to gather the partial gradient, ∇Si(w), which is calculated with (Xi,  yi) at each local institution. After computing the global gradient, ∇S(w), the global center will send it back to ith local institution. Then, w will be updated at each institution by gradient descent with the same learning rate, w ← w − η∇S(w). After stopping the updating step under the same criteria, each institution calculates the sum of squared residual, S[g](w[g];Xi[g],yi[g]), and send it to the global center. The global center gathers the global sum of squared residual, S[g]=∑i=1ISi[g]. Finally, the global center calculates the F-value with equation (1) and then computes and sends the p-value to all institutions.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

4.1 Linking hippocampal volume to tau deposition

In this experiment, we stratify 847 subjects into three subgroups based on their APOE genotype status: non-carriers (NC), heterozygotes (HT), and homozygotes (HM). And then, we use the federated chow test model to explore the difference of the changes in hippocampal volume and the measure of tau, Braak34, among these cohorts. The volume of each side of hippocampus is used as the predictors and Braak34 is used as the response. Both sides of hippocampi have significant results with our federated chow test. The p-value of the left side is 5.1e-16, and the right one is 8.5e-16, which means the changes of hippocampal volume and Braak34 are significantly different in different cohorts.

We further adopt Pearson’s correlation to evaluate the relationship between the hippocampal volume (x-axis) and Braak34 (y-axis) of each subgroup, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The top four subfigures are the distributions for left hippocampal volume and Braak34, and the bottom four are for the right hippocampus and Braak34. The first column is the result for all the 847 samples, and the rest three are for the cohorts of NC, HT, and HM, respectively. R and p in each subfigure are the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value. All the p-values are significant and the cohort with HM genotype has the strongest negative correlation between volume and Braak34.

4.2 Linking hippocampal morphometry to tau deposition

We further figure out the regions where the atrophy focuses on the hippocampal surface. In this experiment, we used two morphometry features, radial distance (RD) and tensor-based morphometry (TBM) in different cohorts. Each morphometry feature on the vertex is used as predictor and Braak34 is used as response. A p-value is calculated with the federated chow test to evaluate effect of tau deposition to the morphometry feature on each vertex in the cohorts with different APOE genotype. To adjust for multiple comparisons, we will convert these raw p-values of all the 15,000 features on each surface to false discovery rate (FDR) [22] and consider trios with FDR&lt;0.05 as functionally important. The average correct p-values for RD and TBM on each side of hippocampi are all significant. The average p-values for RD of left and right hippocampi are 2.6e-13 and 3.6e-13. And the p-values for TBM are 4.4e-13 and 6.3e-13.

As the illustration in Fig. 4, we further visualize the p-values on each hippocampal surface to figure out the atrophy regions. Since the p-values are very significant, we normalized the p-values by dividing each p-value by the maximal p-value on each surface. Then, we map the values to the color map as shown in Fig. 4. The warmer color regions have more significant p-values. The top two subfigures are the results for RD and the bottom two are for TBM. The atrophy focuses on the hippocampal subregions, subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield), which is consistent with the previous studies [23]–[25].

4.3 Cumulative distribution analysis

To further compare the effect size of the morphometry features in the federated chow test model, we created cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots of the resulting uncorrected p-values as the previous studies [20]. For null distributions, the CDF of p-values is expected to fall approximately along the line (y = x). These empirical CDFs of p-values are the flip of the more common FDR PP plot; steeper CDFs show stronger effect sizes. We use y = 10−11x line in Fig. 5 since both RD and TBM show excellent effect size, and it is hard to figure out the better one with the null hypothesis (y = x). Use of the y = 10−11x line is related to the fact that significance is declared when the volume of suprathreshold statistics is more than 1011 times that expected under the null hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 5, RD is a little bit better than TBM.

4.4 Federated Learning Stability Analysis

In this experiment, we aim to demonstrate that the performance of our federated chow test model is not greatly affected by different data distribution models across institutions. We synthesized 1,000 samples and randomly assigned them to different independent hypothetical institutions, including one institution, three institutions, and five. We compared the residuals from each linear regression model for each condition and found the residuals remained unchanged, as shown in Table 2. The first column is the ground truth residual and the rest are the residuals for our federated linear model under different data distribution conditions. The results demonstrate our federated chow test will remain stable under different multi-site conditions. Therefore, these results demonstrate the correctness and stability of our federated chow test model.

5. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we proposed a federated model to investigate the effect of tau deposition and APOE on hippocampal morphometry in AD. In the future, we will use this model to study Aβ and AD-related SNP, like rs11136000 on CLU.
