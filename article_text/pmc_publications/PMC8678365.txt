Accurately assessing clinical progression from subjective cognitive decline (SCD) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial for early intervention of pathological cognitive decline. Multi-modal neuroimaging data such as T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), help provide objective and supplementary disease biomarkers for computer-aided diagnosis of MCI. However, there are few studies dedicated to SCD progression prediction since subjects usually lack one or more imaging modalities. Besides, one usually has a limited number (e.g., tens) of SCD subjects, negatively affecting model robustness. To this end, we propose a Joint neuroimage Synthesis and Representation Learning (JSRL) framework for SCD conversion prediction using incomplete multi-modal neuroimages. The JSRL contains two components: 1) a generative adversarial network to synthesize missing images and generate multi-modal features, and 2) a classification network to fuse multi-modal features for SCD conversion prediction. The two components are incorporated into a joint learning framework by sharing the same features, encouraging effective fusion of multi-modal features for accurate prediction. A transfer learning strategy is employed in the proposed framework by leveraging model trained on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET from 863 subjects to both the Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study (CLAS) with only MRI from 76 SCD subjects and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) with MRI from 235 subjects. Experimental results suggest that the proposed JSRL yields superior performance in SCD and MCI conversion prediction and cross-database neuroimage synthesis, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions, affecting an estimated 47 million people worldwide (Jack Jr et al., 2011; Association et al., 2018). The Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study (CLAS) reported that 4.5% of people older than 60 have AD dementia in China (Xiao et al., 2016). There is no effective cure for AD-related dementia, while early intervention may delay the progression. Hence, identifying AD at its early or preclinical stage is essential for drug development and timely intervention of AD-related cognitive decline. Previous studies have proven that AD pathology has already been ongoing in a long preclinical phase, such as subjective cognitive decline (SCD) (Jack Jr et al., 2010) during which individuals have self-reported reported cognitive decline but no impairment on standardized cognitive tests (Jessen et al., 2014a). Considering that SCD individuals are at increased risk of developing AD and its prodromal stage (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) (Jack Jr et al., 2013; Barnes et al., 2006; Amariglio et al., 2012; Buckley et al., 2016b,a; Kryscio et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017), it is clinically meaningful to predict the progression of SCD for drug development and possible intervention of AD-related cognitive decline.

Increasing evidence has shown that SCD is related to AD biomarkers, such as reduced glucose metabolism uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) and brain changes revealed by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (van der Flier et al., 2004; Striepens et al., 2010; Yue et al., 2018). Several studies have shown that SCD individuals are biologically different from cognitively normal (CN) subjects in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers (Stewart et al., 2008; Scheef et al., 2012; Jessen et al., 2014b; Yue et al., 2021). To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first attempts dedicated to multi-modal neuroimaging-based SCD progression/conversion prediction, i.e., predicting whether an SCD subject would convert to MCI within a period.

Existing studies have shown that MRI and PET contain complementary information for early diagnosis of brain disorders (Kawachi et al., 2006; Gray et al., 2013; Zu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018; Perrin et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2021). It is usually challenging to collect complete multi-modal data from each subject in clinical practice, caused by patients’ dropout or failed scans. Compared with MRI, it is generally more difficult to obtain PET data due to the relatively higher cost of PET scanning and other issues such as patients’ concerns about radioactive exposure. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), existing multi-modal methods usually first impute missing neuroimages/features, such as employing an image generator to impute the missing modality (Li et al., 2014; Sikka et al., 2018; Sharma and Hamarneh, 2019), and then perform feature learning and classification (Lassila et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2015b; Campos et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2014b; Yi et al., 2019; Pan et al., 2020). They treat imputation and multi-modal feature learning as two separate tasks, which may lead to suboptimal performance. Besides, we usually have a very limited number (e.g., tens) of subjects with SCD (Yue et al., 2021), bringing difficulty in constructing robust models and negatively affecting prediction performance (Cheng et al., 2015a, 2017).

To address these issues, we propose a Joint image Synthesis and Representation Learning (JSRL) framework for SCD conversion prediction based on incomplete multi-modal (e.g., MRI and PET) data. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), our JSRL integrates image synthesis and multi-modal representation learning into a unified framework. The key idea is that these two tasks share the same multi-modal features (derived from the image generator) for image synthesis and classification, encouraging effective feature fusion for accurate prediction. To address the limited data problem, we further propose a transfer learning strategy for SCD conversion prediction by leveraging the JSRL learned from a large-scale ADNI database (with MRI and PET acquired from 863 subjects) to a small-scale SCD database (with only MRI from 76 subjects). The hypothesis is that, since SCD may be the preclinical stage of MCI/AD and AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, the discriminative brain changes between AD/MCI and cognitively normal subjects are potential biomarkers for SCD conversion prediction.

A preliminary version of this manuscript was previously published (Liu et al., 2020). This paper extends the preliminary version substantially with the following improvements. 1) We have added more experiments to compare our JSRL with its five variants as well as two data imputation methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 2) Besides the original task of SCD conversion prediction, we have applied our method to a related but different task (i.e., MCI conversion prediction). 3) Besides the initially used two datasets, i.e., ADNI (Jack Jr et al., 2008) and CLAS (Xiao et al., 2016), we have extended our work to generate ADNI-like PET scans for the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) dataset with original amyloid PET (Ellis et al., 2009).

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows. A joint image synthesis and representation learning (JSRL) framework is developed for SCD conversion prediction using incomplete multi-modal data. This is different from previous approaches that discard data-missing subjects (Young et al., 2013; Suk et al., 2014) or treat image/feature imputation and multi-modal feature learning as two separate tasks (Campos et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2020).

A transfer learning strategy is developed to handle the limited data problem by leveraging JSRL learned from ADNI to CLAS and AIBL. Due to the lack of SCD subjects in ADNI, a reasonable label transfer strategy is proposed to partition training data in ADNI.

Extensive experiments have been performed to validate the effectiveness of JSRL in SCD conversion prediction, MCI conversion prediction, and neuroimage synthesis.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the most relevant studies. In Section 3, we introduce the materials and proposed method. In Section 4, we compare the proposed method with several competing methods for SCD conversion prediction, analyze the influence of several major components of JSRL, and apply JSRL to MCI conversion prediction and cross-database neuroimage synthesis. We further compare our method with previous studies and analyze the limitations of the current work in Section 5. Finally, this paper is concluded in Section 6.

2. Related Work

This section briefly reviews the most related work, including studies on subjective cognitive decline (SCD), multi-modal neuroimage analysis, and transfer learning for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders.

2.1. Studies on Subjective Cognitive Decline

In recent years, more attention has been drawn to subjective cognitive decline. Some interesting findings have been found about SCD. Jesen et al. (Jessen et al., 2014a) proposed to list several features associated with SCD, i.e., age at onset of SCD ≥ 60, which increases the presence likelihood of preclinical AD. Caselli et al. (Caselli et al., 2014) compared self-based and informant-based SCD to distinguish emotional factors from early-stage AD, and found that those with incident MCI generally self-endorsed decline earlier than informants (e.g., their family members or friends). Some studies also found that SCD subjects with normal cognition might undergo AD pathology changes related to their neuroimaging biomarkers, which may gradually progress to the next stage, such as MCI (i.e., the prodromal phase of AD) (Yue et al., 2018; Striepens et al., 2010; Jack Jr et al., 2010). With structural MRIs, Striepens et al. (Striepens et al., 2010) reported total hippocampus volume loss in SCD cohorts. Yue et al. (Yue et al., 2018) found a ladder-shaped difference of left-larger-than-right asymmetry in the amygdala (i.e., MCI&gt;SCD&gt;CN) using MRIs. However, only a few neuroimage-based studies attempted to predict the conversion from SCD to MCI within a follow-up time (Yue et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020). In (Yue et al., 2021), the authors proposed a simple prediction model with only five (three clinical and two structural MRI-derived) features to identify pSCD from sSCD, which is the first MRI-based study for SCD analysis. Their experimental results suggested that SCD individuals who could develop to MCI might be identified from sSCD with a combination of a few clinical information and structural MRI-based neuroimaging biomarkers. In this work, we propose to construct a multi-modal neuroimage-based model for SCD conversion prediction.

2.2. Multi-Modal Neuroimage Analysis

Previous studies have shown that different modalities (e.g., MRI and PET) can provide complementary information for identifying disease-related brain changes (Kohannim et al., 2010; Jack Jr et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2015). In recent years, many researchers focused on multi-modal studies for computer-aided diagnosis of brain diseases (Pan et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2015b; Liu et al., 2014b; Young et al., 2013; Hinrichs et al., 2011; Suk et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2017; Zu et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2020; Thung et al., 2017; Hor and Moradi, 2016). For example, a Gaussian process classification method was developed, by using structural MRI, PET, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) data to identify MCI patients who will convert to AD within a period (Young et al., 2013). Suk et al. (Suk et al., 2014) developed a systematic method for a joint feature representation from paired patches of MRI and PET with a multi-modal Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). These methods make full of multi-modal information and achieve good performance. However, they usually need complete multi-modal neuroimages, making their methods less practical since collecting complete multi-modal data for each subject is usually expensive and time-consuming in clinical practice. To address the issue of incomplete data, some imputation/completion techniques have been utilized, such as Zero completion, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and image generation by employing an image generator (Campos et al., 2015; Van Tulder and de Bruijne, 2015; Li et al., 2014; Sikka et al., 2018; Sharma and Hamarneh, 2019). Based on synthesized data, multi-modal prediction models can handle those subjects with incomplete data (Campos et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2020). For example, Pan et al. (Pan et al., 2020) proposed a hybrid generative adversarial network (HGAN) to impute missing neuroimages, and then developed a spatially-constrained Fisher representation network (SCFR) to extract statistical descriptors of neuroimages for disease diagnosis. However, these methods usually perform feature selection of each modality individually, ignoring the underlying association between MRI and PET.

2.3. Transfer Learning for AD-Related Disease Diagnosis

Computer-aided methods for identifying stable SCD (sSCD) and progressive SCD (pSCD) individuals are similar to those used for identifying MCI subjects who will convert to AD within a period. For early diagnosis of AD (e.g., SCD and MCI), the number of training samples is usually very limited, while the feature dimension is very high. This so-called small-sample-size problem has been one of the main challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, which may lead to overfitting issues. Many machine learning methods have been proposed to address this issue via transfer learning (Cheng et al., 2015b, 2017; Filipovych and Davatzikos, 2011; Da et al., 2014; Lian et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2019). Cheng et al. (Cheng et al., 2015b) developed a domain transfer feature selection method for MCI conversion prediction by using auxiliary data (i.e., AD and cognitively normal subjects) for discriminative feature selection. They further proposed a multi-domain transfer learning framework for the early diagnosis of AD by using multiple auxiliary domains (Cheng et al., 2017). Lian et al. (Lian et al., 2020) verified the effectiveness of transferred knowledge for model training, in which the task of MCI conversion prediction was implicitly enriched by utilizing the supplementary information of AD and NC subjects. These transfer learning methods suggest that discriminative brain changes from cognitively normal (CN) to AD are potentially related to MCI, considering AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, knowledge learned from AD-related data can also be used to promote the performance of SCD conversion prediction.

3. Materials and Methodology

In this section, we first introduce studied subjects and image pre-processing, and then present the proposed method in detail.

3.1. Studied Subjects and Image Pre-Processing

Three datasets are used in this work: 1) the Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study (CLAS) database, 2) the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1 and ADNI-2) database, and 3) Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) database (Ellis et al., 2009). Baseline data in ADNI are used in this work, while subjects that appear in both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 are removed from ADNI-2 for independent evaluation.

CLAS.

It contains only 3T T1-weighted MRIs acquired from 76 SCD subjects. Following (Abdulrab and Heun, 2008), the SCD group in CLAS meets the following criteria: 1) the onset age of &gt;60 years old; 2) the presence of gradual memory decline persisting for ≥ 6 months; 3) objective memory performance within normal range. According to follow-up outcomes after 7 years, SCD subjects are categorized into stable SCD (sSCD) and progressive SCD (pSCD). At the follow-up visit time (i.e., 7 years), 24 SCD subjects converted to MCI within 84 months after baseline, 52 SCD subjects kept cognitive normal, and none of them converted to AD at the follow-up visit. Therefore, there are 24 sSCD and 52 pSCD in CLAS.

ADNI-1 &amp; ADNI-2.

The ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets contain all baseline T1-weighted MR images and partial fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images from 1) AD patients, 2) cognitively normal (CN) subjects, 3) MCI individuals, and 4) SCD (also called subjective memory complaint) subjects. There are a total of 1,145 subjects with complete MRI and FDG-PET scans from the baseline ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets. Following (Hor and Moradi, 2016; Lian et al., 2020; Pan et al., 2020), we use the 36-month window to define the conversion of SCD and MCI subjects in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2. For example, if an SCD subject converts to MCI at the 24-th month after baseline and does not have data at the 36-month, we treat it as pSCD because it converts to MCI within 36 months. Only 16 SCD subjects have definite conversion results within 36 months (i.e., 11 pSCD and 5 sSCD) in ADNI, and they only have MRI scans. Similarly, we divide CNs into stable CN (sCN) and progressive CN (pCN), where pCN would convert to MCI within 36 months and sCN remains stable. The MCI subjects in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 are further divided into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI), where subjects with pMCI would convert to AD within 36 months after baseline and subjects with sMCI remain stable.

AIBL.

A total of 235 subjects with paired T1-weighted structural MRI and Flutemetamol/Pittsburgh compound B (Flute/PIB)-PET scans were randomly selected from AIBL. It is worth noting that no FDG-PET data is available in this dataset. So this dataset is only used to evaluate image synthesis performance of the proposed method, and is not involved in the task of SCD/MCI conversion prediction.

Table 1 and Table 2 show demographic and clinical information of studied subjects in two tasks, i.e., SCD conversion prediction and MCI conversion prediction. In the task of SCD conversion prediction, we add MCI subjects with uncertain conversion results as the negative category considering the prediction from SCD to MCI, which helps to increase the sample size. In MCI conversion prediction, we use only MCI subjects (i.e., pMCI and sMCI) that have clear definitions on whether they would convert to AD within 36 months after baseline time.

In this work, all training subjects have paired MRI and PET scans, but the test CLAS and ADNI data have only MRI scans. All MRI scans were pre-processed through a standard pipeline, including the following steps: 1) skull-stripping by calling the BET function in Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012), 2) intensity inhomogeneity correction using Freesurfer, and 3) spatial normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)1 (Ashburner and Friston, 2005). For each PET image, we first linearly aligned it to its corresponding MRI scan, and then normalized its intensity (via min-max scaling), followed by spatial normalization to the MNI space (using the same transformation as the one used to spatially normalize the corresponding MRI). Thus, each pair of MRI and PET for the same subject will have spatial correspondence. After pre-processing, all MRI and PET scans will have the same size as the MNI template (i.e., 181 × 217 × 181 with 1 mm isotropic voxels).

3.2. Proposed Method

The proposed JSRL is illustrated in Fig. 2, consisting of 1) an image synthesis subnetwork (IS) to synthesize missing neuroimages and generate multi-modal features and 2) a representation learning subnetwork (RL) for multi-modal feature fusion, feature learning, and classification/prediction. These two subnetworks share the same imaging features, e.g., [FM1, FM2] for MRI and [FP1, FP2] for PET, encouraging that the association between MRI and PET can be effectively modeled and the multi-modal representations are prediction-oriented. At the training phase, our JSRL network is trained on 863 subjects with complete MRI and PET from the ADNI dataset. At the test phase, the trained model is directly applied to 76 subjects with only MRI from the CLAS dataset. Besides, a label transfer strategy is proposed to leverage the relatively large-scale training data in the SCD-related domain (i.e., ADNI) to aid the SCD conversion prediction task in the small-scale CLAS dataset.

3.2.1. Problem Formulation

In this work, we aim to utilize the domain knowledge learned from ADNI with MRI and PET scans to aid the SCD conversion prediction with only MRI in CLAS. Let IM denote the domain of MRI scans and IP be the domain of PET images. We denote a set of subjects (with paired MRI and PET scans) as D={(xM,xP)∣xM∈IM,xP∈IP}. If one has MRI but no PET data, an image generator GM: IM → IP trained on paired multi-modal data can impute missing PET based on its corresponding MRI. With real MRI and synthetic PET, our multi-modal classification/prediction model is formulated as (1) y=C(xM,GM(xM)),

where y is the class label (e.g., stable SCD or progressive SCD), and C is a classifier that tells whether an SCD subject will convert to MCI within a certain period. As shown in Fig. 1 (a), conventional methods usually treat image synthesis and representation learning as two separate tasks, by first learning GM and then training C independently. The proposed JSRL incorporated image synthesis and representation learning into a unified framework, by sharing multi-modal features (generated by GM) between the IS and the RL subnetworks. Based on the shared multi-modal features (i.e., [FM1, FM2] for MRI, and [FP1, FP2] for PET), the prediction model can be formulated as (2) y=C(FM1,FM2,FP1,FP2).

3.2.2. Joint Image Synthesis and Representation Learning

1) Image Synthesis (IS) Network:

As shown in the top panel of Fig. 2, our image synthesis (IS) model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize PET and generate multi-modal features, with a generator (i.e., GM) and a discriminator (i.e., DP). The generator has an encoder with 3 convolutional (Conv) layers, a residual part with 6 residual blocks, and a decoder with 2 deconvolutional (Deconv) layers and 1 output Conv layer. The channels of 3 Conv layers are 16, 32 and 64, respectively, with each Conv layer followed by instance normalization and relu activation. In the decoder, the channels of 2 Deconv layers are 32 and 16, respectively, and the output Conv layer is followed by instance normalization and tanh activation. The first and the output Conv layers in GM have the filter size of 7 × 7 × 7, while the remaining Conv and Deconv layers have the filter size of 3 × 3 × 3. The discriminator contains 5 Conv layers with the channels of 32, 64, 128, 256 and 1, respectively. The first 3 Conv layers are followed by instance normalization and leaky relu activation with the leaky rate of 0.2.

Two types of loss functions are used in GM, i.e., an adversarial loss and a reconstruction loss, defined as (3) L(GM)=∑{xM∈IM,xP∈IP}‖GM(xM)−xP‖1+log(1−DP(GM(xM))),

where the 1st term is the reconstruction loss (with ∥·∥1 denoting the l1 norm), and the 2nd term is the adversarial loss. For DP, we aim to minimize the following loss function (4) L(DP)=∑{xM∈IM,xP∈IP}log(1−DP(xP))+log(DP(GM(xM))).

Constrained by L(GM) and L(DP), the trained IS network is encouraged to generate PET images that are visually similar to their corresponding real ones, and also generate multi-scale imaging features via the encoder and decoder parts. The multi-scale features will be shared with the following representation learning (RL) network for SCD conversion prediction. Note that the proposed IS model can also generate synthetic MRI scans based on PET images. In this work, we focus on generating synthetic PET images based on MRI. The reason is that in clinical practice, we usually have MRI but lack PET data, since PET imaging is relatively more expensive and invasive while MRI imaging is less costly and noninvasive.

2) Representation Learning (RL) Network:

To capture the association of different modalities, we develop a representation learning (RL) network to fuse multi-scale MRI and PET features for SCD conversion prediction. Considering that the generator constructs a mapping between MRI and PET from the same subject, their features generated by the IS network naturally convey their underlying relevance. Accordingly, a multi-scale feature sharing mechanism is designed to facilitate knowledge transfer between the IS and the RL subnetworks. Specifically, the MRI feature maps (denoted as FM1 and FM2) of the first two Conv layers in the encoder and the PET feature maps of the last two Deconv layers in the decoder (denoted as FP1 and FP2) of GM are shared by IS and RL networks.

As shown in the middle panel of Fig. 2, the RL network consists of two major components: 1) a multi-modal feature fusion module to fuse multi-scale feature maps generated by the IS network, and 2) a classification module to learn high-level semantic features and perform prediction. Denote the concatenation of FM1 and FP1 as C1, and the concatenation of FM2 and FP2 as C2. In the multi-modal feature fusion module, C1 is followed by a Conv layer with a stride of 2, while C2 is followed by a Conv layer with a stride of 1. Then, these features are concatenated, followed by a max-pooling operation. The fused features are then fed into the classification module. This classification module contains four successive Conv layers to learn high-level semantic features and a fully-connected (FC) layer for prediction, where the first 3 and the last Conv layers are followed by the max-pooling and average-pooling (stride: 2), respectively. These four Conv layers have 16 channels with the filter size of 3 × 3 × 3. Feature maps of the last Conv layer are reshaped into a feature vector (with 1,280 neurons), followed by the FC layer for classification/prediction. We propose a hybrid loss function in RL network for classification, defined as (5) Lhybrid=L(GM)+λLC,

where LC is the universal cross-entropy loss that is defined as (6) LC=−ylogp(x)−(1−y)log(1−p(x)),

where p(x) is the estimated probability of x belonging to the correct class y. We use the hybrid loss to jointly train the generator and the RL network, encouraging that the to-be-generated multi-modal representations by the IS network are prediction-oriented. The parameter λ is empirically set as 1 in this work.

3.2.3. Transfer Learning

To deal with limited training data, we propose a transfer learning solution by leveraging knowledge from the relatively large-scale ADNI dataset to the small-scale CLAS dataset. A label transfer strategy is designed to augment training samples, and a model transfer strategy is used for neuroimage imputation and SCD conversion prediction.

Fig. 3 illustrates the possible progression of four categories, including CN, SCD, MCI and AD. Since pCN and pSCD subjects would convert to MCI within a period, we assume that they have similar brain changes in their neuroimages, We denote subjects belonging to the five categories (i.e., sNC, pNC, sSCD, pSCD, and MCI) as SCD-adjacent subjects, and use them to aid SCD conversion prediction due to their close relationship (i.e., preclinical or prodromal stage of AD). We reasonably regard sNC and sSCD as positive samples, and treat pNC, pSCD and MCI as negative samples in ADNI. Through this label transfer strategy, we train JSRL for joint image synthesis and prediction on ADNI, and then apply the trained model to CLAS via model transfer. Thus, the knowledge learned from ADNI can be transferred to CLAS for SCD conversion prediction.

3.2.4. Implementation

The training of JSRL was performed via two steps. 1) In the 1st step, we trained the GAN (with GM and DP) for 50 epochs in the IS network to impute the missing neuroimages and generate multi-modal imaging features. We first trained GM by minimizing L(GM) with fixed DP, and then trained DP by minimizing L(DP) with fixed GM, iteratively. 2) In the 2nd step, we jointly trained the generator GM and our RL network for 30 epochs for multi-modal feature learning and prediction. The Adam solver with a learning rate of 2×10−3 was used in the IS network. The gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 10−2 was used in the joint training of GM and the RL network.

For efficient optimization, we used different training data in different tasks as shown in Tables 1–2. 1) For SCD conversion prediction (i.e., pSCD vs. sSCD classification), we used MRI and PET data of 863 subjects (including 205 sCN, 29 pCN and 629 MCI) from ADNI to train our JSRL model. 2) For MCI conversion prediction (i.e., pMCI vs. sMCI classification), we used 940 subjects (including 205 sCN, 325 sMCI, 164 pMCI and 245 AD) from ADNI to train our JSRL network. The code has been made publicly available2.

4. Experiments

In this section, we first evaluate our method in the task of SCD conversion prediction, and then perform an ablation study to compare different variants of our proposed method. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our method on another challenging task, i.e., MCI conversion prediction. Finally, we evaluate the cross-database neuroimage synthesis performance of our method on ADNI, CLAS and Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) databases (Ellis et al., 2009).

4.1. Results of SCD Conversion Prediction

Experimental Setup.

We first evaluate the performance of our JSRL in SCD conversion prediction, by comparing JSRL with three multi-modal methods using different handcrafted features, including 1) gray matter (GM) volume within 116 regions-of-interest (denoted as ROI) (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002; Rusinek et al., 1991), 2) patch-based morphology (PBM) method (Liu et al., 2014a), and 3) landmark-based local energy patterns (LLEP) (Zhang et al., 2017). Features of MRI and PET are concatenated in these three methods, followed by a linear support vector machine (SVM) for prediction. We also compare JSRL with three methods with different imputation ways, including Zero, KNN (Campos et al., 2015) and a state-of-the-art deep learning method called HGAN+SCFR (Pan et al., 2020) with a hybrid generative adversarial network (HGAN) and a spatially-constrained Fisher representation (SCFR) network. The HGAN+SCFR method performs image/feature imputation and neuroimaging feature learning separately, which is different from our JSRL model that treats image synthesis and classification jointly. Besides, the HGAN+SCFR method uses a late fusion strategy that first extracts imaging features of MRI and PET individually and then concatenates them at the last several Conv layers for prediction. In contrast, the proposed JSRL uses an early fusion strategy that fuses the multi-modal features through a multi-modal feature fusion module in the first several Conv layers of the RL network for prediction. In addition, the HGAN+SCFR inputs MRI and real/synthetic PET images, while our JSRL inputs multi-modal features generated from the same generator (in the image synthesis network) for prediction. We reasonably infer that the underlying relationship between the multi-modal features can be better conveyed by generating them from the same generator and fusing them using an early fusion strategy for prediction.

Note that three methods (i.e., ROI, PBM, and LLEP) cannot synthesize missing PET images, and they extract PET features from the real PET images from ADNI databases during the training phase and our synthetic PET scans via JSRL during the test phase. Besides, we compare our method with two different feature imputation methods based on ROI-based gray matter volume features, including Zero and KNN methods (Campos et al., 2015). In the Zero method, we simply fill the missing values with zeros. In the KNN method, we fill missing features with its k-nearest neighbor rows in the training set. We also compare our method with the single-modal counterpart of each competing method, including ROI-M, PBM-M, LLEP-M and HGAN+SCFR-M that use only MRI data. More details on the competing methods can be found in Supplementary Materials.

For a fair comparison, all competing methods use the same transfer learning strategy as our JSRL. That is, they use SCD-adjacent subjects as training data (i.e., label transfer), and their models are trained on ADNI and tested on CLAS (i.e., model transfer). When training deep models, such as HGAN+SCFRM, HGAN+SCFR and ours, we randomly partition 20% of each category in the training data as the inner validation set to optimize hyperparameters (i.e., the number of epoch and learning rate) and determine their values when the corresponding model achieves the best performance (in terms of AUC) on the validation set. Then, we train the models on all training data by fixing these hyperparameters and apply the trained models to the test set. The performance of SCD conversion prediction is measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC), balanced accuracy (BAC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and F1-Score (F1S).

Experimental Results.

The results achieved by nine methods in SCD conversion prediction are reported in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3, our JSRL method outperforms conventional handcrafted feature based methods (i.e., ROI, PBM, and LLEP), the deep learning method (i.e., HGAN+SCFR), and two feature imputation methods (i.e., Zero and KNN) in most cases. This suggests the effectiveness of the proposed joint learning framework for image synthesis and multi-modal representation learning. Especially, the proposed JSRL achieves an improved SEN value (i.e., 0.750), which is 8.3 percent higher than the second-best SEN result (i.e., 0.667 achieved by LLEP-M and HGAN+SCFR-M). In real-world applications, the high sensitivity of JSRL may be very useful to accurately identify subjects with progressive SCD. Besides, compared with HGAN+SCFR that separately performs image synthesis and classification, JSRL with the proposed joint learning strategy significantly boosts the AUC result. This may be due to that joint learning can implicitly harness the complementary information of MRI and PET. Table 3 also suggests that most methods (trained on ADNI) work well in SCD conversion prediction on CLAS. This implies that the proposed transfer learning strategy (with label transfer and model transfer) effectively facilitates knowledge transfer from ADNI to CLAS.

4.2. Ablation Study

Experimental Setup.

Our JSRL contains three key components, i.e., label transfer (LT), multi-modal representation sharing (MMRS) mechanism, and joint training (JT) of IS and RL subnetworks. To investigate their influence, we compare JSRL with its three variants for ablation analysis, including JSRL-dLT using a different label transfer strategy, JSRL-oMMRS without sharing features between IS and RL subnetworks, and JSRL-oJT that trains IS and RL subnetworks separately. Besides, to investigate the effectiveness of single-modal representations generated from our proposed model on SCD conversion prediction, we compare JSRL with its single-modal counterparts, namely JSRL-M and JSRL-P. The detailed network architectures of JSRL-oMMRS, JSRL-M and JSRL-P can be found in Figs. S1–S2 in the Supplementary Materials.

JSRL-dLT: This method uses the same training data as JSRL (i.e., SCD-adjacent subjects in ADNI), but employs a different label transfer strategy by treating CN (with sCN and pCN) as the positive category and MCI as the negative category.

JSRL-oMMRS: In the JSRL-oMMRS method, those missing PET images are firstly generated from the image synthesis network. Then, to generate multi-modal feature inputs of the RL network, we perform two sequential convolution operations for MR and PET images individually, in which the strides of the first and the second Conv layers are 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, the separately generated multi-modal representation inputs are fed to the RL network, which is similar to the JSRL model. That is, our proposed multi-modal representation sharing mechanism is not employed in JSRL-oMMRS.

JSRL-oJT: The JSRL-oJT method trains the IS and the RL subnetworks separately. In JSRL, we first train the IS network, and then train IS and RL subnetworks jointly by optimizing the hybrid loss in Eq. (5). In JSRL-oJT, the hybrid loss in the RL subnetwork is replaced with a cross-entropy loss to facilitate the separate training of the IS and the RL subnetworks.

JSRL-M: In JSRL-M, only MRI representations (i.e., FM1 and FM2) generated by the encoder part in the image synthesis network are fed into the RL network (with the same network architecture as JSRL).

JSRL-P: In JSRL-P, only PET representations (i.e., FP1, FP2) generated by the decoder part in the image synthesis network are fed into the RL network (with the same network architecture as JSRL).

Experimental Results.

The results of our JSRL and its five variants in SCD conversion prediction are summarized in Table 4. Table 4 suggests that our JSRL with three strategies (i.e., LT, MMRS, and JT) achieves the best performance, while other variants achieve the overall degraded performance. Some other interesting observations can also be found in Table 4.

1) When we use different auxiliary domains (i.e., MCI vs. CN) to aid SCD conversion prediction, JSRL-dLT also achieves good results (e.g., AUC=0.711). This suggests that the task of pSCD vs. sSCD classification is implicitly related to the task of MCI vs. CN classification, since AD is a neurodegenerative disease that develops over time. However, part of CN subjects would convert to MCI within a period (similar to pSCD), which may introduce ambiguous information for SCD conversion prediction. Our proposed label transfer strategy deliberately regards sCN and pCN subjects as positive and negative categories, respectively, aiming to augment training samples. Even though only 29 pCN subjects in the ADNI dataset made the performance difference between JSRL and JSRL-dLT small, we can imagine the JSRL model will be more robust with the increased number of pCN subjects in the training set. 2) The JSRL-oMMRS method yields significantly degraded performance in comparison to JSRL. This confirms our assumption that the multi-modal representation shared between the IS and RL subnetworks conveys the potential relationship between different modalities, thereby helping to improve prediction performance. 3) Compared with JSRL-oJT, the joint training (via optimizing a hybrid loss) in JSRL helps improve the classification performance. The possible reason is that joint training encourages the model to generate prediction-oriented features, further constraining the IS model for efficient optimization. 4) The JSRL method is also superior to its single-modal counterparts (i.e., JSRL-M and JSRL-P), which validate the effectiveness of multi-modal representations generated by JSRL.

4.3. Application to MCI Conversion Prediction

We further evaluate our JSRL in MCI conversion prediction (i.e., pMCI vs. sMCI classification) on ADNI with incomplete multi-modal neuroimaging data. A total of 939 subjects (including 205 sCN, 325 sMCI, 164 pMCI and 245 AD) with complete MRI and PET scans are used as the training data for JSRL and the competing multi-modal methods. That is, sMCI and sCN are treated as the negative category, pMCI and AD are used as the positive category. And 177 subjects (including 81 sMCI and 96 pMCI) with only MRI are used as independent test data. All training data and test data are from the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets and the demographic and clinical information of the studied subjects are summarized in Table 2. The results of five methods in MCI conversion prediction are reported in Fig. 4. Note that the comparison between different methods in this Fig. 4 is fair, based on the same data and data partitions. Fig. 4 suggests that our JSRL achieves the best AUC of 0.838 and ACC of 0.780, which is 4.11 and 5.65 percent higher than the second-best AUC and ACC achieved by HGAN+SCFR, respectively. This validates the effectiveness of the proposed JSRL in MCI conversion prediction. Results in Tables 3–4 and Fig. 4 imply our method can be used as a practical and general learning framework for early identification of AD-related disorders with modality-missing data. To further validate the generalization ability of the proposed method, we also report its results in MCI conversion prediction on ADNI using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy in Fig. S4 of the Supplementary Materials.

Besides, we summarize several state-of-the-art results reported in the literature for MCI conversion prediction using neuroimaging data of ADNI in Table 5. The results in Table 5 are not fully comparable, since these studies used different numbers of subjects and different data partitions. With the rough comparison, Table 5 shows that our JSRL method trained on a relatively large-scale training set obtains competitive performance in MCI conversion prediction on a relatively balanced test set. Even though the work in (Lian et al., 2020) shows a higher ACC, our method achieves the higher AUC result. The characteristic of yielding higher AUC values may be advantageous for more confident prediction, which is potentially very useful in practice (Huang and Ling, 2005).

4.4. Cross-Database Neuroimage Synthesis

To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed image synthesis (IS) subnetwork in JSRL, we further perform cross-database image synthesis on three datasets, including 1) ADNI, 2) CLAS, and 3) AIBL (Ellis et al., 2009). Note that subjects from the ADNI have real FDG-PET images and those from the CLAS and AIBL datasets have no real/ground-truth FDG-PET images. Most subjects in the AIBL dataset have PET with different tracers (e.g., PIB/Flute-PET), and their appearance looks very different from FDG-PET. The IS model is trained on 863 subjects with complete structural MRI and FDG-PET from ADNI in the 1st step, and tested on 147 subjects with complete MRI and PET from ADNI (not involved in model training) for evaluation. Those 76 subjects with only MRI from CLAS and 235 subjects with complete MRI and Flute/PIB PET from AIBL are also used as independent test data for qualitative evaluation. The visual results can be found in Fig. S5 of the Supplementary Materials. To quantitatively evaluate our IS model, we compute the average structure similarity (SSIM) index and the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the synthetic PET images and the corresponding real ones of 147 subjects from the ADNI dataset. The mean SSIM and PSNR values of synthetic PET in ADNI are 0.70 and 27.35 dB, respectively. The quantitative results and the visually reasonable results in Fig. S5 suggest that the proposed JSRL can generate ADNI-like FDG-PET across different datasets. It implies that our method could be potentially used for multi-site data harmonization in multi-center problems with different scanners or scanning protocols.

5. Discussion

In this section, we compare our method with relevant studies for early diagnosis of AD/MCI, and present the limitations of this work as well as future research directions.

5.1. Comparison with Previous Studies

In this work, we developed a multi-modal neuroimaging-based method to predict the 7-year’s conversion from SCD to MCI of 76 SCD subjects with an unprecedentedly long follow-up time from the CLAS study. This task is very challenging due to the lack of PET data and the indistinguishable pathological changes between sSCD subjects and pSCD subjects who are at the very early stage of AD with normal cognition. According to the quantitative results, our proposed JSRL method is effective for the conversion prediction of SCD.

Several strategies may contribute to the effectiveness of early detection of SCD. First, our JSRL leverages the complementary information of multi-modal neuroimages for improving the prediction performances. This is among the first multi-modal neuroimaging-based studies for SCD conversion prediction. Second, the JSRL integrates image synthesis (IS) and representation learning (RL) into a unified framework. Meantime, a multi-modal representation sharing mechanism is presented in JSRL. That is, the inputs of the RL network are the multi-modal representations generated by the IS network rather than the individually extracted MRI and real/synthetic PET features as in previous work (Pan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2014b). Due to the mapping relationship from MRI to PET learned by the image generator, the underlying relationship of multiple modalities from the same subject can be better preserved in the RL network by leveraging the shared multi-modal representations from the image generator as inputs. Besides, a multi-modal feature fusion module is designed in the RL network for early fusion of multi-modal features, which is different from previous methods that extract MRI and PET features separately and fuse them via a late fusion strategy (Campos et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2020). In addition, to address the limited data problem, a transfer learning strategy is proposed by leveraging the JSRL learned from a large-scale ADNI database to a small-scale CLAS database, making the JSRL method feasible.

5.2. Limitations and Future Work

Several issues need to be considered in the future. First, we used a basic GAN architecture for image synthesis, and the improved performance of our method indicated that IS could produce informative multi-modal features for prediction. It is desired to design more advanced networks (e.g., conditional GAN (Mirza and Osindero, 2014) and bidirectional GAN (Zhu et al., 2017)) for IS to further improve the discriminative capability of multi-modal representations. Besides, we used only neuroimaging data for prediction, without considering the demographic information (e.g., age, gender, and education) that may also be related to brain status (Yue et al., 2021). In future work, we will employ demographic information to constrain the learned models. Furthermore, we designed a transfer learning strategy by leveraging knowledge learned from ADNI to CLAS, and did not explicitly consider the distribution gap between these two databases. Since the ADNI contains primarily Caucasian brains and the CLAS consists of Asian brains, it is interesting to develop advanced data harmonization methods (Kamnitsas et al., 2017) to reduce the distribution shift between two databases, which will also be our future work.

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a joint neuroimage synthesis and representation learning (JSRL) framework for SCD conversion prediction based on incomplete and limited multi-modal neuroimages. The JSRL consisted of an image synthesis subnetwork for imputing missing images and a representation learning subnetwork for prediction. The two subnetworks were incorporated into a joint learning framework by sharing multi-modal features. A transfer learning strategy was also designed to facilitate the knowledge transfer between training and test data. Experiments were conducted on three databases, including the ADNI with MRI and FDG-PET, the CLAS with only MRI, and the AIBL with MRI and Flute/PIB PET. The experimental results suggested the efficacy of JSRL in the tasks of SCD and MCI conversion prediction and cross-database neuroimage synthesis, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

Highlights

We present a JSRL method for SCD conversion prediction using incomplete multi-modal data, which is different from previous approaches that discard data-missing subjects or treat image/feature imputation and multi-modal feature learning as two separate steps. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first multi-modal neuroimage-based method on SCD conversion prediction.

A transfer learning strategy, including model transfer and label transfer, is developed to handle the limited data problem.

We validate the proposed JSRL method on different tasks (i.e., SCD conversion prediction and MCI conversion prediction), with experimental results demonstrating its superiority in progression prediction of SCD and early detection of mild cognitive decline.
