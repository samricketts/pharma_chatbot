Background and Purpose

To demonstrate that gradual and continuous WM change and the associated cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients can be captured by DTI parameters and the DTI parameters can be used to complement neuropsychological test scores in identifying T2DM patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Materials and Methods

Forty-two T2DM patients, divided into a group with MCI (DM-MCI; n = 20) and a group with normal cognition (DM-NC; n = 22) based on cognitive assessments, were enrolled together with age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (HC; n = 26). DTI was performed at 3 Tesla, followed by an analysis using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to investigate the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (λ1), and radial diffusivity (λ23) among the groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the performance of using DTI parameters for separating the two T2DM groups.

Results

The whole-brain TBSS analysis revealed that 7.3% and 24.9% of the WM exhibited decreased FA and increased MD (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, between the DM-MCI and the DM-NC groups, while considerably larger WM regions showed FA (36.6%) and MD (58.8%) changes between the DM-MCI and the HC groups. These changes were caused primarily by an elevated radial diffusivity observed in the DM-MCI patients. Radial diffusivity also exhibited subtle but statistically significant changes between the DM-NC and the HC group. Analyses on individual fiber tracts showed pronounced FA reduction and MD elevation in regions related to cognitive functions. The ROC analysis on the right cingulum (hippocampus) showed that FA produced a larger area under the curve (AUC = 0.832) than MD (0.753) for separating MCI from normal cognition among T2DM patients. When FA was combined with MD, the AUC was further improved to 0.857.

Conclusion

This study demonstrates that the DTI parameters can show a significant difference between the T2DM patients with and without MCI, suggesting their potential use as an imaging marker for detecting cognitive decline in T2DM patients. More importantly, this study also suggests that the DTI parameters may capture gradual and continuous WM changes that can be associated with early stages of cognitive decline in T2DM patients before they can be diagnosed clinically using the conventional neuropsychological tests.


Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent disease that affects more than 360 million people worldwide, and is projected to rise to 552 million cases by 2030.1 This metabolic disease can affect a number of organs, including the brain, eye, kidney, heart, vasculature, and peripheral nerves due to long-term sustained hyperglycemia. Brain damage caused by diabetes has attracted increased attention over the recent years. Longitudinal population-based studies have revealed that the relative risk of dementia is 1.2 to 2.8 times higher in people with diabetes relative to those without.2,3

Although neuropsychological tests such as Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment remain to be the prevailing methods for evaluating T2DM patients with and without cognitive decline, a number of neuroimaging studies have emerged to investigate the compromised brain functions of T2DM patients by measuring changes in perfusion,4 metabolism,5 spontaneous brain activity at resting-state,6 and functional connectivity.7 The observed functional changes have been associated with sustained hyperglycemia and the resulting alterations in cerebral vasculature, neurotrophic factors, and neurotransmitters.8 To study the underlying brain structural changes associated with the functional and metabolic abnormalities, Zhang et al. compared the gray matter volume of T2DM patients with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI),9 and concluded that the middle temporal gyrus atrophy was associated with an increased risk of MCI in T2DM patients. Cerebral atrophy and WM hyperintensities were also reported in T2DM patients10 and linked to compromised cognition.11 Additionally, recent studies focusing on Type-1 diabetes mellitus revealed WM changes in superior parietal lobule12 and more pronounced WM hyperintensities in patients with slower information processing.13 The observed changes in WM are of particular interest given its important role as a conduit to transmit neuronal signals to the functional units in the gray matter.

DTI is a powerful neuroimaging method to study WM structural changes in many neurological disorders, including MCI and Alzheimer’s disease.14 In a study by Hsu et al., decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) was found in the frontal lobe of T2DM patients with both global and voxel-based analyses.15 Decreased FA in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus,16 together with increased mean diffusivity (MD) in bilateral hemisphere tracts,17 were also reported. Very recently, Zhang et al. observed that T2DM patients with various degrees of cognitive impairment exhibited widespread WM disruptions, which correlated well with executive dysfunction.18

Although the risk of developing cognitive impairment is considerably elevated among T2DM patients, it is important to recognize that not all T2DM patients develop cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological tests. This raises an interesting and important question: whether the observed WM change occurs only in T2DM patients with cognitive impairment, or in all T2DM patients. We hypothesize that the WM change in T2DM patients, in accordance with cognitive decline, is a gradual and continuous process that may not be adequately reflected by neuropsychological test scores, but can be captured by DTI. The present study therefore aims at testing this hypothesis by sub-dividing the T2DM patients into two groups: those exhibiting MCI and those without, and investigating their DTI parameter changes against a third group of age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy subjects. Additionally, the study also intends to demonstrate that DTI parameters can be used quantitatively to complement neuropsychological test scores in characterizing T2DM patients with and without MCI.

Materials and Methods

Subjects

With approval by the institutional review board, a prospective cross-sectional study design was employed with a recruitment of 70 right-handed adult subjects who provided written informed consent. Among the subjects, 44 were T2DM patients (between 51 and 72 years old; 27 females) recruited from the endocrinology clinic of the performing hospital between May, 2013 and May, 2014. Detailed information about hypoglycemic agent application, family history, clinical complaints and complications was collected. Clinical examinations and laboratory tests, including blood biochemistry, lipids, cholesterol, plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c, and body mass index, were performed.

Diagnosis of T2DM was based on established criteria (i.e., diabetes symptoms and fasting plasma glucose &gt; 7.0mmol/L, or random plasma glucose &gt; 11.1mmol/L, or 2-h glucose &gt; 11.1mmol/L after an oral glucose tolerance test), according to the American Diabetes Association recommendations.19 A battery of neuropsychological tests was performed on the 44 confirmed T2DM patients to assess their cognitive functions as detailed in the next subsection. Based on the results of the neuropsychological tests, the T2DM patients were divided into two groups with and without cognitive impairment. Twenty-six euglycemic subjects (between 50 and 73 years old; 17 females; fasting glucose &lt; 7.0mmol/L, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c % &lt; 6.0%) with normal cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score ≥ 28 and Mini-Mental State Examination score ≥ 27) were also enrolled to serve as age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (denoted as the HC group thereafter).

For all three groups, the following exclusion criteria were used: (a) organic lesions in the brain, such as brain tumors, cerebral infarction, hemorrhage, or vascular malformation; (b) history of stroke, epilepsy, head trauma, or brain surgery; (c) systemic organic disease or history of tumors; (d) moderate and severe hypertension (systolic pressure ≥160mmHg, or diastolic pressure ≥100mmHg), or hyperlipidemia; (e) any contraindication to MRI examination, such as presence of metallic implants, fixed metal dentures, pacemaker, or claustrophobia; or (f) other types of diabetes. In addition to the above criteria, two patients were excluded from data analysis because of excessive motion during the MRI scan (n=1) or scanner malfunction (n=1), resulting in a total of 42 T2DM patients and 26 healthy controls (no exclusion) whose imaging data were used in the final analysis.

Cognitive Assessment

To sub-divide the T2DM patients into two groups with and without MCI, all patients underwent comprehensive physical, neurological, and neuropsychological assessments, which included Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Hachiski Test, Activity of Daily Living Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test performed by two neurologists (ZX and QZ). The inclusion criteria for the MCI group were: (a) complaints of memory decline; (b) both Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination scores ≤ 27; and (c) absence of any other physical or mental disorders that can lead to cognitive impairment, resulting in twenty T2DM patients in the MCI group (denoted as the DM-MCI group). The remaining twenty-two patients formed the group with normal cognition (denoted as the DM-NC group). Hachiski and Activity of Daily Living tests were used to exclude vascular dementia and evaluate the daily-life abilities. Consistency in age, gender, and education level among the DM-MCI, DM-NC, and HC groups was determined with a one-way ANOVA and a Chi-square test.

Image Acquisition

MR images were acquired on a 3-Tesla MRI scanner (Discovery MR750, General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin) using a commercial 32-channel head coil. The subjects were padded with flexible foam to limit head motion. Using axial T2-FLAIR (TR/TE/TI = 8400/160/2100 ms, slice thickness = 5 mm, slice spacing = 1.5 mm, matrix size = 256×256, FOV = 24.0×24.0 cm2, and NEX = 1) and sagittal T1-weighted three-dimensional brain volume imaging sequences (TR/TE/TI = 8.2/3.2/450 ms, flip angle = 12°, slice thickness = 1 mm, matrix size = 256×256×160, FOV = 25.6×25.6 cm2, and NEX =1), high-resolution anatomic images were obtained to exclude possible lesions specified in the exclusion criteria. Following anatomic imaging, DTI data were obtained in the axial plane using a single-shot diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: TR/TE = 8500/66.3 ms, FOV = 25.6×25.6 cm2, matrix size = 128×128, slice thickness = 2 mm, number of slices = 70, number of diffusion gradient directions = 64, b-value = 1000 s/mm2, number of images at b-value of 0 s/mm2 = 5, acceleration factor = 2, and scan time = 9 minutes and 55 seconds.

FSL and Tract-based Spatial Statistics

The diffusion tensor images were processed using the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (http://www.fmrib.ox.au.uk/fsl), or FSL.20 Voxel-wise statistical analysis of the images was performed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)21 with the following steps. First, brain was extracted using the brain extraction tool. An FSL “eddy” tool was applied as a preventive measure to reduce inconsistent image distortion. After generating the FA maps using the FMRIB diffusion toolbox, the images from all subjects were aligned to an FA standard template through a nonlinear co-registration. The aligned FA maps were then averaged to produce a group mean image, which was used to generate an FA skeleton highlighting the tracts common to the entire group. For each subject, an FA threshold of 0.2 was used before projecting the aligned FA map onto this skeleton. The resulting skeletonized FA maps were then fed into a voxel-wise group-level analysis.22 In addition to FA, diffusivity maps based on MD, axial diffusivity (λ1; the principal eigenvalue), and radial diffusivity (λ23; the average of the two remaining eigenvalues) were also generated using the same steps outlined above. Using an FSL permutation test (FSL Randomize Tool with 500 permutations), FA, MD, λ1, and λ23 were tested for differences between the means of the DM-MCI, DM-NC, and HC groups. A significance level of p &lt; 0.05 was used for each of the four DTI parameters (FA, MD, λ1, and λ23) to declare difference between the patient groups.

ROI-based Quantitative Analysis

The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) WM tractography atlas23 in FSL was used as a standard for WM parcellation. The entire WM was parceled into 48 ROIs using the 1mm JHU-ICBM-labels. Specific fiber tracts reported to be relevant to MCI in previous studies24–26 were selected in the telencephalon as well as four regions in the cerebellum and the brainstem (Fig. 1). FA and MD were calculated by averaging the pixel values in each ROI and reported as mean ± standard deviation. Using SPSS 17.0 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York), a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for assessing the performance of separating the DM-MCI and DM-NC groups when FA and MD of the right cingulum (hippocampus) were used individually or in combination via a logistic regression algorithm.

The ROC analysis for the combination of FA and MD was performed using a binomial (bivariate) logistic regression with patients’ condition (DM-MCI or DM-NC) as the dichotomous criterion variable and FA and MD as the dichotomous predictor variables. This method estimated the probability (P0) of being in the DM-MCI group by using the logistic function, P0 = exp (a0 + a1FA + a2MD)/[1 + exp (a0 + a1FA + a2MD)], where a0 is a constant, a1 and a2 are the regression coefficients for FA and MD, respectively. The regression coefficients were determined using a maximum likelihood method.27

Results

Clinical Data

The clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of the three subject groups are summarized in the Online Table. No significant difference was observed among the three groups in age (p=0.130), gender (p=0.854), years of education (p=0.216), and body mass index (p=0.291). The DM-MCI group exhibited a higher level of glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (p=0.008) and a trend towards significant increase in disease duration (p=0.066) when compared with the DM-NC group.

Whole-brain DTI Comparisons among Groups

The whole-brain TBSS analysis revealed that 7.3% (10102/137832 voxels) and 24.9% (34353/137832 voxels) of the parcellated regions exhibited decreased FA and increased MD, respectively, in the DM-MCI group compared with the DM-NC group (Fig. 2). Analysis of the individual eigenvalues illustrated that the reduced FA and increased MD in the DM-MCI group were caused primarily by an elevated radial diffusivity λ23, rather than changes in axial diffusivity λ1 (Fig. 2). Compared to the results in Fig. 2, more extensive changes in FA (36.6% (50384/137832 voxels)) and MD (58.8% (81104/137832 voxels)) of the WM regions across the entire brain were observed between the DM-MCI and the HC groups (Fig. 3). In addition, λ1 also showed noticeable changes in Fig. 3. These observations indicate that DTI parameters of the DM-NC group differed from those of the HC group, suggesting gradual WM changes already occurred in the DM-NC patients even when neuropsychological tests did not indicate MCI, which supports our hypothesis. Additional evidence to reinforce our hypothesis can be found in Fig. 4 where a direct comparison between the DM-NC and the HC groups revealed moderate changes in radial diffusivity λ23 in several regions, including the bilateral external capsule and the temporal WM areas, as well as the right frontal WM areas and corona radiata.

Differences in FA and MD of Specific Fiber Tracts among the Groups

Tables 1 and 2 summarize the FA and MD differences (p &lt; 0.05 with false discovery rate correction), respectively, in the selected fibers across the three groups. Among the 15 fiber tracts analyzed using the JHU atlas,23 significantly decreased FA and increased MD were observed in the left external capsule (EC.L) between the DM-MCI and DM-NC groups. Additionally, we also observed FA differences in the left anterior limb of internal capsule (ALIC.L), right and left anterior corona radiata (ACR.R and ACR.L), left posterior thalamic radiation (PTR.L), right and left Cingulum (hippocampus) (CH.R and CH.L), and MD differences in the left retrolenticular part of internal capsule (RIC.L), left superior corona radiata (SCR.L), and right sagittal striatum (SS.R). These differences, which suggest that FA and MD may serve as alternative surrogates to the conventional neuropsychological test scores, are illustrated in Figs. 5A (for FA) and 5B (for MD). More importantly, when the DM-NC and the HC groups were compared, significant differences in FA were found in the right corticospinal tract (CT.R), and right cerebral peduncle (CP.R), and differences in MD were found in the right retrolenticular part of internal capsule (RIC.R) and right external capsule (EC.R). Again, these observations support our hypothesis. Overall, the atlas-based analyses on individual fiber tracts suggested that pronounced FA reduction and/or MD elevation occurred mainly in the internal/external capsule, corona radiata, and cingulum (in the vicinity of the hippocampus) regions.

ROC Analysis

The feasibility of using FA and MD to separate the DM-MCI and DM-NC groups, as indicated by Fig. 5, is further demonstrated in an ROC analysis. Figure 6A shows the ROC curves in the right cingulum (hippocampus) of using DTI parameters for identifying DM-MCI (positive) from DM-NC (negative). FA (AUC = 0.832, 95% Confidence Interval 0.705–0.958) had a higher AUC than MD (0.753, 95% Confidence Interval 0.608–0.899). When combining FA and MD using a logistic regression model, the AUC value was further improved to 0.857 (95% Confidence Interval 0.735–0.979). Figure 6B shows a scatterplot with all T2DM patient data. The best cutoff values of FA and MD, determined using a Youden’s index, are indicated by the vertical and the horizontal dash lines, respectively. The black dash line corresponds to the cutoff probability of the best sensitivity (0.864) and specificity (0.800) when combining FA and MD.

Discussion

The results of this study (Figs. 2–4 and Tables 1–2) provided several evidences to support our hypothesis that the WM change in T2DM patients is a gradual and continuous process that may not be adequately reflected by neuropsychological test scores, but can be captured in DTI parameters. The observations were made possible by dividing the T2DM patients into two groups according to their cognitive functions and examining changes in DTI metrics in each group against healthy controls. Using a prevalent DTI analysis tool - FSL, we observed not only decreased FA and increased MD in the brain of the T2DM patients with clinically confirmed MCI as compared to those without (Figs. 2 and 5), but also subtle yet important changes in radial diffusivity (λ23) between the DM-NC and the HC groups (Fig. 4). These results have not been reported previously. We also observed widespread FA and MD changes between the DM-MCI and the HC groups (Fig. 3), which reinforced the findings in a recent study.18

The widespread WM differences in Fig. 2 indicate that the observed changes in DTI metrics are strongly coupled with cognitive decline. Using individual eigenvalues, we were able to pinpoint that the FA and MD changes were associated with elevated radial diffusivity, instead of decreased axial diffusivity. Previous studies have related elevated radial diffusivity to compromised myelin sheath, and reduced axial diffusivity to axonal damage.28,29 Thus, the WM changes in Fig. 2 are likely caused by changes in myelin sheath or increased interstitial space between the myelin-covered axons in DM-MCI patients. The exact mechanism on why long-term sustained hyperglycemia would compromise myelin sheath remains unclear. Small vessel alterations associated with hypo-perfusion and inflammatory factors can be possible causes.30

Although both Figs. 2 and 3 compare the DM-MCI group against subjects without clinically-confirmed cognitive impairment, the results are considerably different. In addition to changes in radial diffusivity, Fig. 3 also shows extensive change in axial diffusivity λ1, suggesting axonal damage in the DM-MCI patients compared to the HC. A number of studies have shown that T2DM and Alzheimer’s disease share several pathogeneses, including insulin deficit, glucose-mediated toxicity, and amyloid-β-peptide accumulation.8,31 One of the important pathological bases of Alzheimer’s disease is neurofibrillary tangles,32 caused by the phosphorylated tau protein. As a terminal axonal lesion, neurofibrillary tangles and subsequent synapse loss can lead to progressive loss of memory and compromised cognition. The similar mechanism may explain the observed λ1 elevation in Fig. 3. More importantly, the increase in radial diffusivity in the DM-NC patients shown in Fig. 4 can be a significant finding as it suggests minor to moderate damage to the myelin sheath in the early phase of cognitive decline (e.g., amnesia) in T2DM patients before they can be clinically diagnosed using neuropsychological test scores.

Our investigation of regional WM alterations was focused on the telencephalon because of its pivotal role in cognition and dementia. Not surprisingly, DTI parameter changes were observed in the cingulum near the hippocampus which is related to learning and memory,24 as well as in the anterior limb and the retrolenticular area of the internal capsule. Furthermore, the FA or MD differences between the DM-NC and HC groups in the corticospinal tract and external capsule (Tables 1 and 2) provide more specific evidence to support our hypothesis that early changes during the course of cognitive decline can be detected by DTI before the patients become symptomatic.

The present study has also demonstrated that FA and MD can become potential imaging markers (Fig. 6) that are sensitive to cognitive declines in T2DM patients. These markers can be used individually or combined to complement the existing neuropsychological tests. Zhang et al. recently reported that FA changes in the external capsule were correlated with executive dysfunction.18 Reijmer et al. observed that increased MD was associated with slowing information processing and worsened memory performance.17 These studies, together with our results, all indicate FA and MD can quantitatively characterize the cognitive decline process that would eventually lead to clinical symptoms to be reflected in the neuropsychological scores.

Our study has several limitations. First, despite the attempt to exclude other causes for WM changes, it is still possible that an underlying process independent of DM is associated with the cognitive decline. Non-diabetic patients with similar cognition need to be studied to control for the possibility that the cognitive decline rather than DM is associated with changes in DTI measures. Nonetheless, the present study suggests that DTI metrics have the potential to predict cognitive impairment in patients with T2 DM (Fig. 6). Second, although we excluded subjects with severe and moderate hypertension or hyperlipidemia, a small number of subjects with mild hypertension or hyperlipidemia were included to increase the statistical power. We observed very similar results in separate analyses with and without the inclusion of the mild hypertension (or hyperlipidemia) subjects, indicating that the effect caused by mild hypertension or hyperlipidemia was insignificant. Third, as rigorous clinical diagnosis of MCI remains a challenge, dividing the T2DM patients into the DM-MCI and DM-NC groups can be subject to inaccuracy. Lastly, given the slow development of MCI, a longitudinal study would be needed to test whether DTI measures can predict the development of cognitive impairment in patients with T2DM.

Conclusion

Our study has demonstrated that DTI parameters can show a significant difference between the T2DM patients with and without MCI, suggesting their potential role as an imaging marker for detecting cognitive decline in T2DM patients. More importantly, our study also indicates that the DTI parameters may capture gradual and continuous WM changes that can be associated with early stages of cognitive decline in T2DM patients before they can be diagnosed clinically using the conventional neuropsychological test scores.
