The rapid increase in computing power, especially with the integration of graphics processing units (GPUs), has dramatically increased the capabilities of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To date, these capabilities extend from running very long simulations (tens to hundreds of microseconds) to thousands of short simulations. However, the expansive data generated in these simulations must be made interpretable not only by the investigator who performs them, but by others as well. Here, we demonstrate how integrating learning techniques, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks, into analysis pipelines can reveal the kinetics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) protein aggregation. We review select AD targets, describe current simulation methods, and introduce learning concepts and their application in AD, highlighting limitations and potential solutions.


pmcIntroduction

The hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) [1] are amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) [2] and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau [3]. Other amyloidogenic diseases include Parkinson’s [4] and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [5]. Risk factors for AD include single residue changes in APOE and TREM2. Among the mechanisms proposed to explain why they are disease-causing is molecular kinetics, i.e., transitions between relevant states. A classic example of this is Aβ aggregation, which involving soluble proteins transiting into an insoluble β-sheets-rich fibril. Experimental validation has proven difficult due to metastable substates and rapid interconversion [6]. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations could characterize these states. Currently, individual measurements are on a femtosecond (10−15 s) timescale; however, the elongation rate, demonstrated to be roughly 0.32 molecules per second per fibril (one monomer added every ~3 seconds), is unachievable using all-atom simulation techniques.

MD simulations at an atomic level can characterize interactions between proteins and the impact of single mutations [7]. However, they can be prohibitively computationally expensive in testing quantities, such as conformational kinetics [8] or ligand-receptor dissociation [9]. Recently, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques with MD simulations improved dimensionality reduction [10] and clustering [11], which can combine to determine metastable states. Below we discuss how the integration of learning techniques with highly sampled simulation data using many (in some cases, thousands) short simulations can uncover molecular mechanisms that are currently intractable to experimental inquiry. Multiple short simulations, as opposed to a single long one, permit execution of thousands of simulations over distributed compute systems at reasonable timescales.

Below, we introduce several artificial intelligence methods that have been successfully integrated into simulation analysis pipelines and describe applications that benefited from the integration approaches.

Macromolecular Systems in Alzheimer’s Disease

AMYLOID-β

Aβ is a key player of AD and the peptides involved, their enzymatic generation, heterogeneity, and composition have been described [12]. Different Aβ aggregate states may lead to distinct phenotypes. A recent cryoEM structure (Figure 1A) of an Aβ40 fibril from AD brain [13] suggests cross-β layers in parallel β-sheets, with the outer layers in β-hairpin conformations [14]. CryoEM of fibrils from patient meninges observe multiple morphologies (Figure 1B) [15], differing from in vitro structures. Structures of Aβ42 (Figure 1C) [16], and of mixtures of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Figure 1D) [17] were also obtained.

TAU

NFTs composed primarily of tau aggregates are closely related to neuronal loss and AD [18]. The tau isoforms differ with their activity modulated by phosphorylation [19] and acetylation [20]. NFT structures are composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments (SFs) [21] with unique folds observed in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) [22,23] (Figures 1E and 1F). Experiments pointed to key nucleation points [24]. Short peptides containing these sequences can aggregate in replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations[25].

Apolipoprotein E (APOE)

APOE (Figure 2A) [26] is the primary lipid and cholesterol transporter in the central nervous system (CNS), with its ε4 isoform being the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD [27]. There are three main isoforms of APOE, APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4, differing at residues 112 and 158 (ε2, Figure 2E; ε3, Figures 2B,D; ε4, Figure 2C) [28]. Multiple models were proposed for the APOE structure, in its lipidated and non-lipidated forms, for ε3[29], ε4[30], and ε2[31]. The NMR structure [32] of a monomeric mutant, with stability identical to that of the wild-type protein was solved. APOE requires substantial conformational changes to accommodate lipid association [33] and models were proposed for this association[34,35].

Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)

TREM2 is a transmembrane protein in the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) family [36]. High resolution data are limited [37,38]. Among the AD-associated microglial genes, TREM2 variant-carriers are at increased risk of developing AD [39]. Our preliminary study identified a variant associated with the R47H mutation in human AD brains and tauopathy mouse brains [40].

Biomolecular interactions involving APOE with core AD factors

Modeling protein interactions [41,42] is vital to understand aggregation pathways. APOE–Aβ [43], and APOE-tau interactions [44] have been explored. These studies of molecular modeling proposed a dynamic equilibrium between two APOE states (Figures 2F–H). Lipidation is isoform-dependent, pointing to lipidation as a potential therapeutic target [45]. Mutational effects on the APOE-TREM2 interaction [46] were studied experimentally and recapitulated by a neural network-based approach to predict the most likely residues to be involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). TREM2 is an Aβ receptor and its interaction modes [46] and consequences were explored.

Big Data and Tools for Molecular Simulations

While databases of simulation data exist [47], the enormous amount of data generated, numerous force fields, and myriad simulation programs make the creation of a centralized database for curating such data an onerous task. Though not always the case (see examples below) an experimentally derived structure is the starting point for molecular simulations. These structures can be obtained from databases, including RCSB [48], wwPDB [49], or PDBe [50]. Additionally, there are databases for conformational ensembles of disordered proteins, such as the Protein Ensemble Database [51]. Protein-protein interactions with high structural resolution could be of interest as well, and databases such as Instruct [52], Interactome3D [53], or My Personal Mutanome [42], can be used to find both experimental and high quality computationally modeled complexes.

However, there are cases where that is either not possible (the structure has not been solved), or a solved structure isn’t suited for a particular problem. These types of structures can be manually constructed using one of many molecular modeling tools available, such as PyMOL or UCSF Chimera [54]. For more complex structures, a homology or comparative modeling approach, such as MODELLER [55], can be used. For structures without homologs, an iterative approach such as I-TASSER [56] could be implemented. All tools are listed in Table 1 with a brief description and link.

Structures obtained by the mechanisms above are static, thus limited. To obtain data required to implement learning tools, we must set the systems into motion using molecular dynamics software. We will not discuss construction of systems or parameterization here; system setup will be dependent on the chosen simulation software. While not a comprehensive list, the tools in Table 2 should suit most simulation needs.

Methodologies of Artificial Intelligence

Recent improvements in computing capacity, especially with respect to rapid graphics processing units (GPUs), allow a significant increase in the amount of data that can be generated by MD simulations over even short timescales. Simulation timescales have jumped from nanoseconds to microseconds, and in some cases even milliseconds. The difficulty, then, lies in making these data accessible to human interpretation. Machine learning techniques can aid in selecting the description of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the system through the choice of collective variables or functions of the position of the atoms in the system (Figure 3). Here, we outline mechanisms used in previous MD studies related to AD, their implementation, and a the software packages which use these methods.

Clustering

Clustering is a mechanism by which we can reduce the dimensionality of the trajectory by grouping data points based on some similarity metric. Two main types of clustering are used for molecular simulation data: partitioning and density-based. In a partitioning scheme, data points are divided into groups based on similarity to each other, with the most popular method using this scheme being k-means [70]. In k-means clustering, the number of clusters is chosen beforehand (the “k” in k-means). The center of each of k clusters is the mean of all the cluster members. Initially, k data points are randomly selected to be the centers of each cluster. Then, the rest of the data set is assigned to a cluster based on closeness to one of these centers. In an iterative process, new centers are defined and their assigned data points are determined, and this repeats until the clusters no longer have any membership changes. However, these calculated “centers” are not necessarily points in the original data set. The k-medoids [71] algorithm ensures each cluster center (or medoid) is a point in the original data set.

In density-based clustering, conformations are clustered based on their proximity to peaks in the probability distribution, where these peaks generally correspond to metastable states. As opposed to k-means clustering, the number of clusters is not a chosen parameter, but is dictated by the number of peaks in the probability distribution function. A particular data point can be assigned to a cluster without it being similar; the clusters are instead separated by regions of low probability, meaning two points in different clusters may be close to each other. The most popular density-based method is DBSCAN [72], though selection of the appropriate parameters in DBSCAN can be difficult. A more recent clustering algorithm which combines density-based and hierarchical clustering, HDBSCAN[73], has also been gaining traction in clustering simulation data.

Dimensionality Reduction

The most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction in the applications outlined below is Time-Lagged Independent Component Analysis (TICA) [74]. TICA finds coordinates of maximal autocorrelation, as opposed to maximal variance in principal component analysis (PCA). Therefore, PCA allows for a small amount of data points to describe a large portion of the molecular trajectory, and because of this, these data points have been described as the “essential dynamics” of the system. However, these essential dynamics may not capture slow states. In contrast, TICA finds the slow components of the data set; this allows for the detection of metastable states in the system, as well as the reaction coordinates between them. This is a fundamental step in the construction of Markov state models (MSMs), as we will discuss in the next section.

Markov State Models

Markov state models are a type of clustering where each cluster represents a particular state of the system. The integration of TICA into the generation of MSMs allows for a systematic approach to the generation of these states, significantly improving their quality. Key to the generation of appropriate MSMs is the selection of the lag time τ. The lag time must be “Markovian”, which is to say memoryless; the probability of transition from state A to state B is independent of where the system was prior to being in state A. In general, this means the lag time will have some minimum value to maintain its “memorylessness”. Additionally, the lag time must be short enough such that system dynamics can be resolved; the lag time must be chosen to be shorter than the transition time between metastable states. The goal of the MSM is to choose some number of macrostates such that the dynamics of the system are captured, as well as a lag time such that the system dynamics are resolved[75].

VAMPnets

One key requirement for the above combination of techniques is that we are sampling from an equilibrium ensemble. However, some systems, such as intrinsically disordered proteins (see below) will not be at equilibrium. Additionally, significant trial and error is required to construct a reasonable MSM; as noted above, just the selection of the lag time is key to constructing a proper model. VAMPnets (Variational Approach to Markov Processes), however, implements a self-supervised neural network which condenses the construction of the MSMs into a single step, where a single score (called the VAMP score) allows one to assess which features to choose for MSM construction [76].

As of this writing, there are two packages which implement the learning methods outlined above: MSMbuilder [77] and PyEMMA [78]. Both packages are written in python and can be installed using the Conda package management system. While there are some differences in their implementation (for instance, the implementation of the variational principle), both packages are well documented and accessible to anyone with experience in using python packages.

Applications in Alzheimer’s disease

Combinations of the techniques and proteins outlined above have been used not only to demonstrate biophysical properties, but also to further capabilities in the field. A recent study [79] investigated how kinetic ensembles could provide structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic information on disordered proteins like Aβ42 (Figure 1C). Since Aβ42 is conformationally heterogeneous, using standard molecular dynamics techniques such as the free energy landscape, where only a single or a few structural conformations may be used to derive its characteristics, is likely insufficient. How enhanced sampling techniques can obtain information on the thermodynamics of such disordered proteins has been reviewed previously [80]. To integrate information on the kinetics, one must include the transition rates between the conformational states (the kinetic ensembles). The approach involves state decomposition using VAMPnet, outlined above, over a total of 315 μs of simulation time. This allows for a probabilistic, or ‘soft’ clustering, which better allows for fast transitions between metastable states than TICA. Their results were consistent with relaxation times measured with NMR; additionally, the sensitivity of the technique was demonstrated with methionine-oxidized Aβ42. This result demonstrates the capabilities of molecular simulations with the integration of neural networks.

Experiments have demonstrated that growth of Aβ fibrils occurs one monomer at a time [81], though on a timescale not achievable with all-atom molecular dynamics. To overcome this hurdle, a total of 719 μs of simulation time was used to assess the kinetics of transitions between various H-bonded and non-specific bonded states using Aβ16–22 [82]. The selected reaction coordinates for their search over the various β-sheet alignments were the number of hydrogen bonds and the ‘registry’. The authors had previously defined the non-registered state as nonspecific, side chain mediated interactions; the in-register state where the β-sheets are properly aligned; and a misregister state where hydrogen bonds are formed, but the β-sheets are not properly aligned. Using TICA, they identified 15 distinct non-register macrostates, three of which were connected to in-register states and with transitions between non-register states on the order of 1 nanosecond. Transitions between non-register and in-register states occurred between 2 and 6 nanoseconds, indicating that each peptide likely visits multiple non-register states prior to forming its first hydrogen bond with the fibril.

Markov state models and TICA have also been used to investigate the misfolding of the R3 fragment, containing residues 306 through 336, of tau [83]. In this study, a short, high temperature simulation was followed by replica exchange MD to generate initial conformations. From the replica exchange simulation, 280 initial conformations were selected by clustering, and further simulated conventionally for 100 nanoseconds, yielding a total of 28 microseconds of simulation data. The result of their analysis establishes R3 as largely composed of disordered coils and turns, consistent with experimental data. In macrostates where β-sheets were formed, residues 324–327, 331–334, and PHF6 were identified as key residues in sheet formation. Transition path analysis identified a requisite for turn formation, which allowed for the hydrogen bonding required for sheet formation. As sheet formation is a key feature of tau fibrils, this study lends insights into the conformational shift between disordered protein to aggregation-ready β-sheet rich structures.

Similarly, Markov state models and TICA were used to explore the conformational differences between the ε3 and ε4 isoforms of APOE [84]. Their study investigated roughly 2 microseconds of simulation for each isoform, finding a single major conformation for ε3 (roughly 98% population) and multiple metastable macrostates for ε4. These different macrostates are characterized by differences in the solvent accessibility of Arg112, differences in intermolecular interactions, and distribution of the radius of gyration. Further, free energy simulations determined ε4 to be less stable than ε3, with significant variation in secondary structure. Their simulations found helix 3, which contains the site of variation between the isoforms (residue 112), is bent in ε4 while it is not in ε3.

A recent study investigating the impact of both Nasu-Hakola and AD risk variants (p.R47H and p.R62H) in TREM2 used DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to find highly probable conformations for each variant [36]. In all variants studied, a stable primary cluster was found which covered over 100 nanoseconds of the 250 (350 for T66M) nanosecond trajectory. The medoid of each of these clusters revealed there is not likely to be any large conformational changes or misfolding due to the mutations, and that the overall structure is maintained. However, plots of the distribution of the root-mean-squared deviation indicated a higher overall distribution in most of the variants, indicating the potential for regional fluctuations not seen in the wild-type.

As noted above, not all studies consisting of AD-related proteins investigate protein properties. Instead, they may use them as models for method refinement due to their advantageous size and plethora of experimental data for cross-validation. The D.E. Shaw research group took on the task of attempting to determine which force field could best characterize both folded and disordered proteins using very long (30 μs) simulations of various proteins, including Aβ40 [85]. The accuracy of each force field was assessed via comparison to experimental measurements from techniques such as NMR, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). However, they did not address the ability of these force fields to reproduce the kinetics of conformational transitions. Using the same data, Markov state models were constructed to elucidate the underlying kinetics of the Aβ40 simulations [86]; the distance between alpha carbons was selected to describe the conformational space based on the Variational Approach for Markov Process (VAMP-2) score. TICA was then used for dimensionality reduction, with clustering using the density based HDBSCAN [73] to reduce the trajectories to a set of discrete states with transitions between them. The MSM then allows for the determination of the transition times between states based on the probability of each transition given a specified lag time. They found that for most force fields, a single state held the majority of the population, with a few (2–4) low-populated states. However, the transition times from the low-population states to the high-population states were, for most force fields, longer than those predicted by FRET (~1 μs). This resulted in the conclusion that the a99SB-ILDN/TIP4P-D or a99SB-UCB force fields are most suitable for modeling Aβ, as those transitions were sub-microsecond using those force fields.

PERSPECTIVE

While our model disease here is AD, these techniques are extensible to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s Disease (α-synuclein, for example) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, TDP-43). Further, supervised learning methods such as k-nearest neighbors (kNN), gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks and long short-term memory (LSTM) regression models can potentially be used to predict properties from smaller amounts of data. Finally, the recent release of Alphafold2 [87] and RoseTTAFold [62] could open new doors for simulation of proteins without an experimentally solved structure.

Despite their power and promise, there are several limitations of current AI application in MD studies. The numerous molecular dynamics system variables including software, force field, and parameters; differences in computer architecture thus reproducibility; differences in load balancing on identical hardware and more. MD simulations adhere to the central limit theorem: Given an infinitely long simulation, all observables will converge to some equilibrium value. While untenable, the integration of learning methods into the pipeline of MD analysis aids by allowing for many shorter simulations to be assessed together and the results made understandable by the researchers generating them. For example, the 719 μs of simulation time generated to assess amyloid assembly was accumulated using simulations 50 or 200 nanoseconds in length, timescales which can be achieved in hours, while amyloid aggregation occurs on millisecond or longer timescales. Replicates can help alleviate the replicability issue.

Data is sparse. Understandably, databases set up to house simulation data are no longer curated or specific. Blockchain were proposed [88], and swarm learning used to develop disease classifiers [89]. Data promote collaboration [90]; and especially, we believe that integration of the techniques and decentralized data sharing can vastly accelerate biomedical research.
