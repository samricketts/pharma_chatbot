We examined the relationship between in-vivo estimates of tau deposition as measured by 18F-AV-1451 tau PET imaging and cross-sectional cortical thickness as well as rates of antecedent cortical thinning measured from MRI in individuals with and without evidence of cerebral amyloid in 63 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, including 32 cognitively normal individuals (mean age 74 years), 27 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, mean age 76.8 years) and 4 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD, mean age 80 years). We hypothesized that structural measures would correlate with 18F-AV-1451 in a spatially local manner and that this correlation would be stronger for longitudinal compared to cross-sectional measures of cortical thickness and in those with cerebral amyloid versus those without.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of voxelwise atrophy were made from whole brain maps of cortical thickness and rates of thickness change. In Amyloid-β positive individuals, the correlation of voxel-wise atrophy across the whole brain with a summary measure of medial temporal lobe (MTL) 18F-AV-1451 uptake demonstrated strong local correlations in the MTL with longitudinal atrophy that was weaker in cross-sectional analysis. Similar effects were seen in correlations between 31 bilateral cortical regions of interest (ROIs). In addition, several non-local correlations between atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake were observed, including association between MTL atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake in parietal lobe ROIs like precuneus. Amyloid-β negative individuals only showed weaker correlations in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons.

While these data replicate previous reports of associations between 18F-AV-1451 uptake and cross-sectional structural measures, the current results demonstrate a strong relationship with longitudinal measures of atrophy. These data support the notion that in vivo measures of tau pathology are tightly linked to the rate of neurodegenerative change.


Introduction

Deposition of paired helical filament tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) along with accumulation of Amyloid-β plaques is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Hyman &amp; Trojanowski 1997). Ex vivo studies have shown clear associations between NFT burden and antemortem patterns of gray matter atrophy measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in AD (Whitwell et al 2012; Whitwell et al 2008). Recent advances in molecular imaging have made it possible to quantify regional tau burden in vivo (Saint-Aubert et al 2017). 18F-AV-1451 is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer that has been used to measure tau deposition due to its selective binding to certain insoluble forms of tau in paired-helical filaments (Marquié et al 2015). 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake has been reported to broadly replicate patterns of NFT deposition based on widely used neuropathological stages (i.e. Braak Stages) of AD defined by autopsy studies (Braak &amp; Braak 1996; Braak &amp; Braak 1991) -- beginning in medial temporal lobe (MTL), advancing to lateral temporal lobe, inferior frontal, midline and inferior parietal regions, and finally to primary sensorimotor cortices in the latter stages (Cho et al 2016a; Johnson et al 2016; Schwarz et al 2016; Schöll et al 2016) . To the extent that NFT pathology is responsible for downstream neurodegeneration across the disease spectrum and that 18F-AV-1451 binds to AD-related species of tau, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an established measure of AD-related neurodegeneration, should be correlated with tracer uptake. Indeed, there are a few reports in which quantitative structural measures have been found to be associated with specific spatial patterns of tau deposition measured using 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake, similar to those observed in pathology studies (Wang et al 2016; Xia et al 2017). While there is emerging data with regard to the spatial correlation of 18F-AV-1451 uptake with both local and distant cross-sectional structural measures (Dronse et al 2017; Golla et al 2017; Lockhart et al 2017; Ossenkoppele et al 2016; Schöll et al 2016; Sepulcre et al 2016; Vemuri et al 2017; Iaccarino et al 2018; Rafii et al 2017) , the extent of these relationships remain far from clearly delineated. Further, longitudinal atrophy rates, a more direct measure of the dynamic process of neurodegeneration, have not been studied in the context of tau accumulation across the AD continuum, although one study reported local and distant correlations of tau burden and retrospective longitudinal atrophy in a cohort consisting of only cognitively normal individuals (LaPoint et al 2017). Finally, the significance and association of 18F-AV-1451 PET with atrophy in Amyloid-β negative control subjects is uncertain.

In this study, we aimed to extend work on relationships between 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and atrophy by investigating longitudinal measures of atrophy. We hypothesized that in a cohort of Amyloid-β positive individuals that includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects (both MCI and AD), the association of local tau deposition in MTL will be stronger with a longitudinal than cross-sectional measure of atrophy, as this would better reflect an active neurodegenerative process specific to tau pathology. If 18F-AV-1451 PET is sensitive to the NFT pathology associated with aging in the absence of cerebral amyloid, so-called Primary Age-Related Tauopathy (PART), and this pathology has downstream neurodegenerative effects, we would also expect correlation of 18F-AV-1451 uptake with structural measures in Amyloid-β negative individuals, but likely circumscribed to early Braak regions.

We studied structural MR and 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging data in 63 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We correlated a summary measure of 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake in the MTL with cortical thickness-based measures of both cross-sectional and longitudinal atrophy at each voxel in the cortical gray matter. We chose to focus on MTL tracer uptake in a region encompassing perirhinal (including transentorhinal cortex) and entorhinal cortices as these are the earliest regions of NFT deposition given the significant proportion of individuals who were cognitively normal in this cohort and, thus, likely at early disease stage. More broadly, we conducted a cross-modality pairwise correlation analysis in both cross-sectional and longitudinal data between 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and atrophy across 31 bilateral regions of interest (ROI) in the cortex. We performed these analyses separately in Amyloid-β positive and negative groups, as determined by their Amyloid PET scans.

Materials and Methods

Participants

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database. The current study included data from 63 participants. Thirty two were Aβ positive, including 13 cognitively normal elderly controls, 15 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 4 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Thirty one were Aβ negative, including 19 cognitively normal and 12 MCI patients. A summary of participants’ demographic characteristics and basic psychometric measures are reported in Table 1. The Aβ positive and negative groups differed in their age, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores.

Image acquisition

Two T1-weighted structural MRI scans with voxel size 1.0×1.0× 1.2 mm3 were used. The cross-sectional scan was chosen to be the closest in time to and acquired within 75 days on average of the tau PET scan, and an antecedent MRI was acquired 638 days on average prior to the cross-sectional scan to measure longitudinal atrophy (see Table 2). Tau PET imaging consisted of a continuous 30 minute brain scan (6 frames of 5 minute duration) 75 minutes following approximately 10 mCi of 18F-AV-1451 injection. Amyloid PET florbetapir protocol used an injection of 10 mCi of tracer and a 20 min brain scan (4 frames of 5 minute duration) after a 50 min uptake phase. The Florbetapir scan acquired closest in time to the 18F-AV-1451 scan was analyzed (see Table 2). Note that 2 scans in amyloid positive individuals were obtained &gt; 2 years prior to the 18F-AV-1451 PET. As one would not expect a positive scan to become negative over time, we included these individuals despite this delay. PET images were downloaded from the ADNI data archive in the most fully pre-processed format with the image description “Coreg, Avg, Std Img and Vox Siz, Uniform Resolution”.

Image processing

The pre-processed PET images were aligned with the anatomical MRI via rigid body registration using the ANTs normalization software (Avants et al 2014; Avants et al 2008) with a mutual information metric. Each anatomical MRI was segmented into cortical, subcortical and cerebellar ROIs using a multi-atlas segmentation method (Wang et al 2013). The parcellation scheme is described in (Landman &amp; Warfield 2012) (https://www.amazon.com/MICCAI-2012-Workshop-Multi-Atlas-Labeling/dp/1479126187). Mean tracer uptake in cerebellar gray matter (18F-AV-1451) or cerebellar gray and white matter (Florbetapir) was computed and used as reference to generate a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) map for the entire brain. A composite ROI consisting of middle frontal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, precuneus, supra marginal, middle temporal and superior temporal cortex was used to compute a global SUVR for Florbetapir. A threshold of SUVR ≥ 1.11 (Landau et al 2013) was then used to determine Amyloid-β status.

Cortical thickness was estimated using the DiReCT method (Das et al 2009) implemented in the ANTs longitudinal measurement pipeline (Tustison et al 2017; Tustison et al 2014). This method utilizes diffeomorphic mapping between the white matter-gray matter boundary and gray matter-cerebrospinal fluid boundary derived from tissue segmentation to estimate cortical thickness, and produces a volumetric map of local thickness at every voxel in the cortex. An evaluation of DiReCT in relation to other cortical thickness measurement methods can be found in (Klein et al 2009; Tustison et al 2014). Longitudinal estimation utilized an unbiased method that treats each scan in similar fashion such that the measurements at each time point do not depend on their temporal ordering (Avants et al 2010). The resulting maps of thickness and thickness change were mapped to an unbiased population template (Avants &amp; Gee 2004) for voxelwise analysis. A summary measure of MTL 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake was computed over a combined ROI of entorhinal cortex and BA35 and BA36 regions of perirhinal cortex using a multi-atlas segmentation algorithm specific for these regions (Xie et al 2016; Yushkevich et al 2015)

The entire brain for both structural scans in each subject was parcellated into 31 bilateral ROIs based on a previously published volumetric version of the Freesurfer Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas (Klein &amp; Tourville 2012), using a multi-atlas segmentation method (Wang et al 2013). These ROIs were used to generate mean cortical thickness estimates averaged across bilateral regions. Average longitudinal thickness change for each ROI was entered in analysis as an annualized rate of change in mm. Similarly, mean SUVR for 18F-AV-1451 uptake was also calculated for each bilateral ROI.

Statistical Analysis

Partial correlation was used for assessing relationships between the two imaging measurements in Amyloid-β positive and negative groups separately. Covariates used were: 1) age, 2) time between cross-sectional MRI and tau-PET (cross-sectional analysis) or time between antecedent MRI and tau-PET (longitudinal analysis). Note that use of gender as a covariate did not appreciably influence results of these analyses. We performed voxelwise correlation of a summary measure of average 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake in bilateral MTL with cross-sectional cortical thickness as well as with rate of cortical thickness change in the preceding time period. Multiple comparisons correction was done using the Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) method (Smith &amp; Nichols 2009). We then performed a cross-modality ROI-based correlation analysis across the entire brain where 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake was correlated with both cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of cortical thickness between each pair of the 31 ROIs. Permutation-based p-values were computed and subsequently corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate (FDR) (Yekutieli &amp; Benjamini 1999). As a supplementary analysis, we directly compared the cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations using the correlation comparison test described by (Diehl &amp; Arbinger 1992).

Results

Spatial distribution of 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake

Figure 1 top panel shows patterns of 18F-AV-1451 uptake by mean SUVR within each group of participants, as well as a statistical map of significantly greater tracer uptake in Amyloid-β positive individuals. These maps show that spatial extent of significant tau accumulation is limited and is primarily confined to the temporal lobe in the Amyloid-β positive individuals. In those without cerebral amyloid, it is even more restricted largely just to MTL. However, even within the MTL, uptake is significantly higher in the Amyloid-β positive individuals. Figure 1 bottom panel shows statistical maps of group difference in cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of atrophy. Group effects are much weaker for atrophy than for tracer uptake. No voxels survived multiple comparisons correction. The effects in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons are more localized, with the longitudinal effects being generally stronger, especially in medial regions such as MTL.

Voxelwise correlations

Figure 2–3 show patterns of correlation of voxelwise cortical thickness and longitudinal rate of thickness change with a summary measure of MTL 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake. Longitudinal rate of thickness change in the MTL, particularly in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, had a strong and statistically significant relationship with 18F-AV-1451 uptake bilaterally in Amyloid-β positive individuals. Cross-sectional thickness measurements showed a similar pattern in this group, but fewer voxels survived correction for multiple comparisons. More diffuse effects were observed only in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons (Fig. 2b,d), which also show an extensive pattern of remote correlations of thickness with MTL 18F-AV-1451 uptake in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, with the former showing more widespread effects with the more liberal threshold. Scatter plots of some significant clusters are shown as insets. As can be observed, one participant in the Aβ-positive group who had a diagnosis of probable AD had very high longitudinal atrophy rates in the MTL as well as the highest 18F-AV-1451 uptake in this region. We visually checked for imaging and processing-related artifacts in the data and did not find any anomalies. Excluding this data point would still maintain a strong and significant correlation for this cluster (r = -0.76, p&lt;10e-7 with and r = -0.67, p&lt;10e-5 without). In Amyloid-β negative individuals (Fig. 3), while there are no significant effects that survived multiple comparisons correction, some regions showed correlation in the uncorrected data, particularly in precuneus in the cross-sectional data.

ROI-based correlations

Figure 4–5 summarize cross-modality relationships between atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake across pairs of ROIs using a matrix representation that captures both local (diagonal elements) and distant (off-diagonal elements) correlations between tau pathology and cross-sectional/longitudininal measures of structural atrophy.

Similar to the voxelwise analysis, longitudinal rates of MTL cortical thinning (left panel) and cross-sectional measures of thickness (right panel) were significantly correlated with 18F-AV-1451 uptake in MTL ROIs in Amyloid-β positive individuals (Fig. 4). In addition to local MTL effects, lateral temporal lobe ROIs showed significant local cross-modality correlations in Amyloid-β positive individuals. Moreover, both cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of atrophy in multiple temporal ROIs correlated with 18F-AV-1451 uptake in a wide swath of brain regions in lobes outside of occipital, including parietal lobe regions such as inferior parietal, precuneus and posterior cingulate regions, and several ROIs in frontal lobe, including orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. These non-local correlations of 18F-AV-1451 uptake in parietal and frontal lobes with temporal lobe atrophy were stronger, and more restricted to medial temporal lobe ROIs, such as entorhinal cortex, in the longitudinal data. Alternatively, the cross-sectional effects were more diffuse across the temporal lobe and strongest in the inferior temporal and fusiform ROIs. While there were modest local correlations outside of temporal lobe, longitudinal data also showed strong correlation of atrophy rates in some frontal lobe regions such as orbitofrontal cortex with 18F-AV-1451 uptake in largely the same set of regions that had strong correlations with temporal lobe atrophy.

Supplementary analysis showing direct comparison of the ROI-based cross-sectional and longitudinal correlations is presented in Figure S1. Some MTL regions such as entorhinal and parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex showed stronger correlations in the longitudinal data, whereas other areas showed the opposite trend (fusiform and insular cortex). However, none of these effects reached statistical significance when corrected for multiple comparisons.

As noted above, one participant in the Aβ-positive group had very high atrophy rates in the MTL and the highest 18F-AV-1451 uptake in some temporal lobe regions (see scatter plot in Figure 2). Permutation testing for the ROI analysis was done to account for such outliers, and, additionally, the results were qualitatively similar with weaker effects in the correlation of 18F-AV-1451 uptake in frontal ROIs with temporal atrophy when this participant was excluded from analysis. Excluding the time difference between MRI and PET scans as a covariate also did not notably alter the results.

We did not find any significant correlation effects after multiple comparisons correction in the Aβ-negative individuals (Figure 5). However, data uncorrected for multiple comparisons showed a significant correlation of precuneus atrophy with 18F-AV-1451 uptake in a number of ROIs.

Discussion

Local MTL effects in Amyloid-β positive individuals

We found that a summary measure of MTL 18F-AV-1451 uptake in Amyloid-β positive individuals was most significantly associated with longitudinal cortical thinning, and this effect was restricted to the MTL in Family-wise error rate (FWER) corrected analysis. This finding supports the significance of tau accumulation measured in vivo by 18F-AV-1451 uptake as a marker of disease burden: greater tau burden is associated with an increased rate of neurodegeneration in the preceding years. In other words, those with higher tracer uptake in the MTL would be expected to have experienced more significant neuronal injury commensurate with this greater burden.

The local correlational effect within MTL in the cross-sectional analysis was less robust in the MTL and fewer voxels were significant using the FWER corrected statistical threshold. However, when pairwise correlations in the ROI analysis were directly compared (Figure S1), even though some MTL effects were stronger in longitudinal data, the differences were not statistically significant after multiple comparisons correction. Nonetheless, the finding that longitudinal structural measures appear to be more tightly linked with a measure of NFT burden in MTL than cross-sectional structural measures is intuitive. One would expect that a longitudinal measure would reflect the active neurodegeneration in a region over the restricted temporal window of the imaging data acquisitions, which should reflect temporally proximate local pathologies, such as NFT. Alternatively, cross-sectional cortical thickness reflects the sum total of factors influencing the measure of brain structure in that region across the lifespan. These include developmental differences, as well as alterations in neuronal or synaptic density associated with other processes, such as normal aging or cerebrovascular disease, that likely occur over a different timescale than neurodegeneration due to NFTs. Thus, assuming similar measurement accuracy, a longitudinal measure may more accurately reflect the specific neurodegeneration associated with local tau accumulation.

Relationship between MTL tau tracer uptake and atrophy outside of MTL in Amyloid-β positive individuals

While the local relationship between MTL tau tracer uptake and atrophy measures is intuitive, it is worth noting that when using a more liberal threshold there was more spatially widespread association with atrophy in Amyloid-β positive individuals, particularly in the orbitofrontal region in the longitudinal data, and lateral temporal regions in the cross-sectional data (Fig. 2). Strong distant correlation between tau in temporal lobe and cross-sectional cortical thinning in orbitofrontal cortex were also reported by Sepulcre et al. (Sepulcre et al 2016). Further, LaPoint et al. examined retrospective longitudinal atrophy as here and similarly reported local and remote correlations between 18F-AV-1451 uptake in inferior temporal lobe; however, their study was limited to cognitively normal adults and did not dichotomize groups based on amyloid status (LaPoint et al 2017). The distant effects in ours and these prior studies are likely due in part to the fact that MTL and/or inferior temporal tau tracer uptake, reflecting early NFT pathology, may also serve as a summary measure more broadly for disease progression. Indeed, other work has suggested that 18F-AV-1451 uptake in this region does not plateau across the AD continuum through at least mild AD (Tosun et al 2017). As such, it is possible that MTL tau serves as a surrogate for local tau burden in these connected regions, which may then locally drive neurodegeneration. In fact, in the ROI analysis (Figure 4) several, but not all, of the ROIs where atrophy is correlated with MTL or other temporal region 18F-AV-1451 uptake also had significant correlation with local uptake (i.e. significant correlation along the diagonal), particularly in the longitudinal data.

Lack of local effects outside of MTL in Amyloid-β positive individuals

While as noted above there were some local effects observed, such as in orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate regions, particularly in the longitudinal data in Amyloid-β positive individuals (Fig 4, left), many extra-temporal regions typically associated with AD-related atrophy did not display local (or distant) correlation with tracer uptake. The fact that there were not always strong local correlations of atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake in regions outside of the temporal lobe might be explained simply by the lack of significant tau pathology outside of this region in this cohort, as reflected by relatively low 18F-AV-1451 uptake (Fig. 1). While significant 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake in parietal ROIs have been reported in several studies in Amyloid-β positive individuals (Xia et al 2017; Schöll et al 2016), with concomitant thinning in these regions observed (Xia et al 2017), this subset of the ADNI cohort has revealed more restricted uptake to temporal regions (also see Maas et al. (Maass et al 2017)). Finally, in the case of the longitudinal data, limited local correlations might also be a reflection of a potential non-linear trajectory of cortical thinning which may depend on baseline thickness.

While not displaying widespread local correlation in non-temporal regions, we did observe significant correlation of MTL infero-medial temporal cortical atrophy with 18F-AV-1451 uptake in a wide swath of ROIs outside of temporal lobe (Fig. 4 bottom rows), in a number of isocortical regions, particularly parietal and frontal. This suggests that even at low levels of tau, accummulation of tau into extra-temporal regions may be a surrogate for disease progression, reflecting spread of tau pathology outside the temporal lobe. To the extent that MTL atrophy reflects disease stage, we might, therefore, expect to observe a relationship with extra-temporal tau. Alternatively, these more distant relationships of 18F-AV-1451 uptake with temporal regions may be mediated by propagation of tau pathology across connected regions, providing support for the synaptic transmission hypothesis (Frost et al 2009; Lewis &amp; Dickson 2016). Some ROIs showing these effects indeed constitute nodes of the same functional network (e.g. MTL and posterior cingulate are considered parts of the default mode network, and orbitofrontal cortex is part of an anterior temporal lobe network (Das et al 2015)).

Lack of effects in Amyloid-β negative individuals

We did not find strong correlations between 18F-AV-1451 and cross-sectional or longitudinal measures in Amyloid-β negative individuals. The only significant correlation of MTL 18F-AV-1451 uptake with atrophy observed in the Amyloid-β negative individuals was in the precuneus region (Fig 3), but only in data uncorrected for multiple comparisons. While this effect was weak, it is interesting to note that 18F-AV-1451 uptake in multiple other ROIs also appeared to correlate with precuneus atrophy (Figure 5). Interestingly, in this group cross-sectional data appeared to have a stronger effect, which may be a result of any association between 18F-AV-1451 and atrophy occurring on a slower timescale in this group than in Amyloid-β positive individuals and, thus, not well captured within the two year timeframe of the longitudinal analysis.

The Amyloid-β negative group contained a mixture of cognitively normal adults (n=19) and patients with MCI (n=12). While other studies, such as Sepulcre et al. (Sepulcre et al 2016) reported significant local and remote associations between gray matter atrophy and 18F-AV-1451 uptake in a cognitively normal elderly cohort, these studies have not examined such effects in Amyloid-β negative individuals alone. As seen in Fig. 1, 18F-AV-1451 uptake in this group in the ADNI cohort is generally very low, and much lower throughout the temporal lobe compared to the Amyloid-β positive individuals as revealed by the group comparison. For example, the MTL summary measure of tracer uptake in the Amyloid-β negative group was lower on average with a much smaller range (SUVR mean 1.15, std = 0.08, range 0.97 – 1.36) than the Amyloid-β positive group (mean 1.37, std = 0.25, range 1.0 – 2.06). Compared to the Amyloid-β positive group, they were also relatively younger and had a higher proportion of cognitively normal participants. These might further influence correlation of tracer uptake with atrophy. Given this low tau burden in the MTL, as well as the fact that at these low levels effects of “noise” in this region, for example, from off-target choroid plexus binding (Pontecorvo et al 2017; Lowe et al 2016) may be more prominent, other factors may be more likely to drive differences in cortical thickness and rate of atrophy in these individuals than MTL 18F-AV-1451 uptake.

The current result is consistent with another recent report from Mormino et al. (Mormino et al 2016) in which Amyloid-β negative individuals with versus without evidence of neurodegeneration, measured by hippocampal volume or cortical glucose metabolism, did not differ in 18F-AV-1451 uptake. The authors suggested that primary age-related tauopathy (PART) (Crary et al 2014), a common feature of early aging defined by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles of Braak Stage IV or less (usually stages I-III) in the absence of amyloid, was not the driver of the neurodegeneration observed in that cohort. The current finding also could be interpreted as supporting the notion that the presence of PART is not tightly linked to atrophy, including within the MTL. However, a recent study did find correlation of antemortem anterior hippocampal atrophy and Braak NFT stage in PART individuals (Josephs et al 2017). While we did not measure hippocampal volume, that cohort was considerably older (mean age of 90 at death) than the current amyloid negative group which may have influenced our not finding evidence of similar MTL atrophy, particularly given the link between PART severity and age. An alternative hypothesis is that the 18F-AV-1451 ligand may not bind avidly to the specific conformation of tau associated with PART. Indeed, recent autoradiography findings suggest that 18F-AV-1451 binding to the generally more immature tangles of PART was relatively weak (Lowe et al 2016).

18F-AV-1451 as a marker linking tau pathology to AD-related neurodegeneration: Prior studies have shown that 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake patterns reflect clinical phenotypes and associated neuroanatomical variability in AD (Cho et al 2016a; Schwarz et al 2016; Ossenkoppele et al 2016). The relationship between 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and structural atrophy has also been reported in a number of cross-sectional analyses (Xia et al 2017; Sepulcre et al 2016). The strong association between 18F-AV-1451 uptake and longitudinal atrophy rates in an Amyloid-β positive cohort presented here, particularly within the MTL, lends support to the notion that the 18F-AV-1451 tracer links AD-related pathology to the accelerated neurodegeneration associated with NFT pathology. Not surprisingly, given this relationship, increased 18F-AV-1451 uptake is associated with increased cognitive impairment in Amyloid-β positive individuals. (Cho et al 2016b; Johnson et al 2016; Pontecorvo et al 2017). Consonant with the structural MRI findings here, Schöll and colleagues (Schöll et al 2016) found that 18F-AV-1451 uptake was correlated with both cross-sectional and antecedent longitudinal cognitive measures, particularly episodic memory. Importantly, the data here support the value of MRI-based atrophy measurements, along with cognition, for tracking the effects of NFT pathology in Alzheimer’s disease.

Limitations and future work

One limitation of the current study is that longitudinal atrophy was measured during a time period prior to the 18F-AV-1451 scan. Therefore, a temporal order of tau deposition and neurodegeneration resulting from it cannot be established based on these data. Nonetheless, the strong correlation between the antecedent atrophy rate and 18F-AV-1451 uptake indicates a tight coupling of NFT pathology with the neurodegenerative process. Continued collection of follow-up structural imaging data in ADNI will allow us to look at prospective neurodegenerative changes. Further, a direct comparison of longitudinal measures from both modalities will greatly enhance our understanding of their temporal relationship. Another limitation is the modest sample size, particularly to more definitively determine whether there is any relationship in amyloid negative individuals between structure and 18F-AV-1451. Such data will be forthcoming from ADNI, as well as other cohorts, over the next several years.

Conclusion

We examined association of 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake with cross-sectional as well as longitudinal measures of atrophy based on cortical thickness in separate groups of Amyloid-β positive and Amyloid-β negative subjects. The data support a relationship between 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and evidence of neurodegeneration reflected in structural MRI. The somewhat stronger local linkage with longitudinal estimates in the MTL support the coupling of tau burden with active, local neurodegeneration that is perhaps more specifically captured by a longitudinal rather than cross-sectional measure due to the other confounding modulators of the latter. The data support the utility and potential parallel information provided by longitudinal structural MRI and 18F-AV-1451 tau PET imaging for tracking AD-related neurodegeneration.

Fig. 1 Top: Mean SUVR of 18F-AV-1451 uptake in Amyloid-negative (left) and Amyloid-positive (middle) individuals. Right panel shows areas of significantly greater tracer uptake in Amyloid-positive group (p &lt; 0.01 FWER). Bottom: Areas of significantly greater thickness (left) and lower rate of thickness change (right) in Amyloid-negative Individuals. Maps are shown at an uncorrected threshold of p &lt; 0.1 for visualizing trends in the data. Effects were not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons.

Figure 2 Significant clusters of partial correlation between MTL cortex tau uptake and atrophy measured as rate of thickness change (left) and thickness (right) across the brain, with age and time between MRI and PET as nuisance covariates, in Aβ-positive individuals. Top and bottom rows show p-values that have been corrected for multiple comparisons and uncorrected respectively. Insets in top row show coronal view of MTL, and scatterplots of MTL tau vs. atrophy in the largest significant cluster in the MTL, indicated by red circles. Similar scatterplots are shown in the bottom row for significant clusters outside of MTL in the uncorrected data.

Figure 3 Significant clusters of partial correlation between MTL cortex tau uptake and atrophy measured as rate of thickness change (left) and thickness (right) across the brain, with age and time between MRI and PET as nuisance covariates, in Aβ-negative individuals. Top and bottom rows show p-values that have been corrected for multiple comparisons and uncorrected respectively. Arrow shows an area of effect in the precuneus.

Figure 4 Partial correlation of 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and atrophy as measured by rate of thickness change (left) or thickness (right) in 31 ROIs, with age and time between MRI and PET as covariates, in Aβ positive participants. Columns are sorted by ROIs in lobes with most average 18F-AV-1451 uptake on the left to least on the right. ROIs within a lobe are similarly sorted. Columns and rows represent tau and atrophy respectively such that a given row shows correlation between atrophy in an ROI with tau in all other ROIs, and a given column shows correlation between tau in an ROI with atrophy in all other ROIs. Diagonal values represent local correlation of the two measures within the same ROI. Non-empty cells denote significant correlation at permutation-based p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected. FDR thresholds of p &lt; 0.05 correcting for multiple comparisons are indicated in the colorbar. Solid blue cells had strongest effect at FDR-corrected p &lt; 0.01. Red lines indicate lobes.

Figure 5 Partial correlation of 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake and atrophy as measured by rate of thickness change (left) or thickness (right) in 31 ROIs, with age and time between MRI and PET as covariates, in Aβ negative participants. Red lines indicate lobes, which are presented in the same order as in Figure 4. Within each lobe, columns are sorted with most average 18F-AV-1451 tau tracer uptake on the left and to least on the right. Rows are sorted in the same order. Columns and rows represent tau and atrophy respectively such that a given row shows correlation between atrophy in an ROI with tau in all other ROIs, and a given column shows correlation between tau in an ROI with atrophy in all other ROIs. Diagonal values represent local correlation of the two measures within the same ROI. Non-empty cells denote significant correlation at permutation-based p &lt; 0.05 uncorrected for multiple comparisons. No correlations survived FDR correction for multiple comparisons.
