Background and Purpose:

Traditional cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with white matter disease. Since hypertension results in vascular stiffness and impaired cerebral perfusion, we hypothesized that it would be the most significant risk factor associated with microstructural white matter (WM) disruption in apparently healthy middle-aged persons with a family history of early-onset coronary artery disease.

Materials and Methods:

This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants in the Genetic Study of Atherosclerosis Risk (GeneSTAR) with DTI. Regional fractional anisotropy (rFA) was measured of 181 segmented brain regions using Eve Atlas. Risk factors were examined using univariate analysis for 48 regions representing deep WM structures. Minimal multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, race and maximal linear regression models adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors were performed for regions meeting Bonferroni threshold in the initial analysis.

Results:

Included were 116 subjects (mean age 49±11, 57% males) with moderate load of cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects with hypertension had significantly lower rFA in the right cingulum and left stria terminalis in the minimal and maximal regression models. Additionally, there were lower rFA in the left fornix in the maximal model and right sagittal stratum in the minimal model. Systolic blood pressure values were significantly associated with rFA in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus in the maximal model. There were no significant differences among rFA for other cardiovascular risk factors.

Conclusions:

In middle-aged apparently healthy persons with susceptibility to vascular disease, among all known cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension was associated with microstructural WM disruption.


Introduction:

White matter hyperintensities (WMH), frequently incidentally observed on brain MRI, have been attributed to cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) 1. Histopathologically, WMH areas show nonspecific changes of gliosis, myelin and axonal loss, tissue rarefaction and lipohyalinosis 2. The exact mechanisms leading to CSVD remain undefined3. It has been hypothesized that interactions between genetics and environmental factors lead to small vessels changes causing white matter (WM) damage secondary to vasculopathy and arteriosclerosis resulting in hypoxia and hypoperfusion. This is influenced by altered cerebrovascular autoregulation as well as endothelial and blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction4. Among traditional cardiovascular risk factors, hypertension has been consistently found to be related to CSVD5. Rat models of hypertension develop diffuse WM disease 6. Human studies have linked hypertension directly to arterial stiffness leading to WM changes related to CSVD 7,8,9. Other traditional atherogenic risk factors such as diabetes, smoking, and hyperlipidemia have been less consistently linked to CSVD compared to hypertension10,11. DTI has emerged as a valuable tool for assessment of WM in health and disease through measurement of signal attenuation in the fiber tracks12. DTI has an advantage over conventional T2 or FLAIR MRI sequences due to improved mapping and three-dimensional diffusion characterization incorporating spatial location. This property can be used to describe the magnitude, degree, and orientation of diffusion anisotropy12.

Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is a sensitive biomarker for WM integrity reflecting axonal loss or demyelination12. Decreased FA has been found in cases of demyelination, edema or inflammation12. In patients with CSVD, impaired WM microstructure has been detected by DTI studies13. In Nyquist et al, our group demonstrated that WMH contributes to subclinical psychomotor impairment in apparently healthy subjects14. In this work, we aim to investigate the relationship of various atherogenic vascular risk factors with the impairment of WM microstructure as measured by DTI. We hypothesized that early changes in regional WM can be detected by DTI in apparently healthy middle-aged persons and that these changes are primarily associated most strongly with hypertension.

Methods:

Sample and recruitment:

We selected healthy participants who underwent DTI as part of the Genetic Study of Atherosclerosis Risk (GeneSTAR) silent stroke study. GeneSTAR is an ongoing prospective study of vascular disease risk factors, occult CAD and cerebrovascular disease, and incident CAD and strokes in 3533 initially healthy family members ascertained from probands hospitalized with documented CAD under 60 years of age14. Of these initially healthy family members, 808 were screened with cranial MRI for WMH; of those, 116 healthy subjects had DTI sequences.

The 116 participants included apparently healthy asymptomatic siblings, their offspring, and the offspring of the probands who were 30-72 years of age. None had known personal history of CAD, stroke or transient ischemic attacks, and represented 97 families. Exclusion criteria included: chronic corticosteroids, life-threatening diseases, neurologic diseases impairing accurate MRI interpretation, implanted metals prohibiting MRI scans, atrial fibrillation, and symptomatic cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board (NA_00002856). All participants provided written informed consent before screening.

Participant screening and data collection:

Each participant was examined by a physician. All participants were screened for CAD and stroke risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, body mass index (BMI), and cigarette smoking15. Race was self-reported. Height and weight were measured and BMI was calculated16. Current cigarette smoking was defined by self-report of any smoking within the past month and/or 2 expired carbon monoxide levels of ≥ 8 ppm. Blood pressure (BP) was measured three times over the course of one day and the average systolic and diastolic BP were used to characterize BP according to guidelines of the American Heart Association17. Hypertension was defined as an average measured BP ≥ 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic, and/or use of antihypertensive drug. Blood for measurements of cholesterol and glucose levels was collected following 12 hours fast overnight. Type II diabetes was defined as a physician-diagnosed history, a fasting glucose level of ≥126 mg/dl, and/or use of hypoglycemic antidiabetic medications. Total cholesterol, HDL, and triglyceride levels were measured according to the United States Centers for Disease Control Standardized Methods18. LDL cholesterol was estimated using the Friedewald formula19.

MRI acquisition:

MRI was acquired on a Philips 3T Achieva imaging unit according to standardized protocols. The following series were acquired: (1) axial T1-weighted MPRAGE: repetition time 10 milliseconds (ms), echo time 6 ms, voxel size 0.75 × 0.75 × 1 mm3, contiguous slices, with FOV 240 × 240 mm, and matrix 320 × 320 mm, (2) axial spin echo T2-images: repetition time 4685 ms, echo time 78 ms, voxel size 0.47 × 0.47 × 3 mm3, contiguous slices, FOV 240 × 240 mm and matrix 512 × 512, (3) DTI: repetition time 7043 ms, echo time 71 ms, voxel size 0.83 × 0.83 × 2.2 mm3, contiguous slices, FOV 212 × 212 mm and matrix 256 × 256, 32 directions and b-value = 700 s/mm2.

DTI processing and analysis:

DTI were preprocessed and analyzed using MRI studio package (DTI studio, DifeoMap, ROI editor) publically available at www.mristudio.org through Johns Hopkins University. First, all images (T1, T2, DWI) were reviewed by a board certified physician in neurology and neurocritical care (YH) for the presence of any rotation, motion artifact or eddy current artifact in DTI image viewer application which was followed by tensor calculation according to the standardized steps in DTI studio20. Three dimensional FA, mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity maps were created following tensor calculation.

WM segmentation was performed in the subject’s native space according to the Eve-WM atlas in DifeoMap and ROI editor package software21. First, FA and mean B0 maps were skull stripped in ROI editor. Following skull stripping, a dual channel large deformation diffeomorphic mapping algorithm was used in DifeoMap to perform linear and non-linear registration to the Eve WM atlas “JHU-MNI-SS-SS” template in the Montreal Neurological Institute space. This step allowed automated segmentation of the FA subject map in the native space by using the inverse registration matrix into 181 regions (Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B and S1C). Mean regional FA value (rFA) was calculated in each of the regions by choosing a voxel FA threshold ≥ 0.2 to exclude voxels that included cerebrospinal fluid and grey matter. Then, 48 regions of the atlas representing the deep white matter regions primarily affected by CSVD were selected for the subsequent statistical analysis (Table S1, Supplementary Figure S1D, S1E and S1F).

Statistical analysis:

Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software (v9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Univariable analysis comparing mean rFA between participants with and without current smoking, hypertension and diabetes was completed using T-tests. Spearman rank order correlations were used to test the associations between continuous variables including systolic BP, diastolic BP, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, blood glucose and BMI with mean rFA. The significance threshold was defined using Bonferroni method for adjustment for multiple comparisons as P≤0.001 (0.05/48 rFA regions). A minimal linear regression model predicting rFA and adjusting for age, sex and race was performed for the regions that met the Bonferroni significance threshold. Then, to understand the effect of combination of atherogenic risk factors on rFA, a maximal linear regression model predicting rFA and adjusting for age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes, total cholesterol, BMI and smoking was performed for these regions.

Results:

The study sample consisted of 116 middle-aged participants (mean age 49.6±11 years, 49.1% males, and 40.5% African American), well-educated with moderate vascular risk factors (Table 1). Review of T2 sequences did not reveal any stroke or localized WMH. WMH involving the periventricular and deep WM areas were largely symmetric without predilection to any specific areas of the selected WM regions. Participants with hypertension showed widespread reduced rFA compared to participants with normal BP meeting the Bonferroni threshold (≤0.001) in the left genu of corpus callosum, left external capsule, right cingulum, left stria terminalis, bilateral fornices, and right sagittal stratum (Table S2, figures 1 and 2). This relationship remained significant in the minimal regression model, after adjusting for age, sex and race, in the right cingulum, left stria terminalus and right sagittal stratum (table 2). Additionally, the relationship remained significant independent of other atherogenic vascular risk factors in the maximal linear regression model in the right cingulum, left stria terminalis and left fornix (table 2). Mean rFA correlated with the average systolic BP in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (table S3, figures 2 and 3). There was a trend towards significance of the relationship of this region rFA with hypertension in the minimal regression model (P=0.079). However, this relationship was significant in the maximal regression model following adjustment for other vascular risk factors (table 2).

Notably, rFA was not significantly associated with diabetes or current smoking status in any of the regions (Tables S4 and S5). Additionally, rFA was not significantly correlated with blood glucose, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, diastolic BP and BMI in any of the regions (Tables S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, and S12).

Discussion:

In this cross-sectional study, we show that decreased rFA, reflecting microstructural WM disruption, is strongly associated with hypertension in middle-aged apparently healthy subjects at increased risk for vascular disease in the deep WM regions of the brain. We did not observe additional associations between rFA and other traditional atherogenic vascular risk factors such as diabetes, total cholesterol, LDL, BMI or smoking. The role of DTI in detecting WM disruption in subjects with vascular risk factors has been addressed previously22-39.

Hypertension has been consistently associated with decreased FA and elevated mean diffusivity in different WM regions including normally appearing WM 24,25,27-31. In addition, increased BP values linearly correlated with decreased FA in the right anterior corpus callosum, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the fibers that project from the thalamus to the superior frontal gyrus in one study22. The majority of these studies have assessed elderly subjects with an average age of (65.8-83) years 25,27-29 or investigated the effect of hypertension in middle life on the development of WM disruption at a later age31. Two previous studies investigated the relationship of systolic BP and WM microstructure at younger age (39.2-48) years22,24. One of them linked adiposity as measured by waist circumference with BP and WM microstructure24. The second paper analyzed systolic BP relationship with regional DTI metrics by measuring the number of voxels within each WM region that correlated with the systolic BP value22. Our study used a different approach by analyzing the average rFA of well-defined WM atlas in relationship to vascular risk factor. Given the healthy nature of our relatively younger cohort compared to the literature, we believe that we captured the disease at an early stage where it has not progressed yet to involve all the subcortical WM in a symmetric fashion. Indeed, our results reflect that by showing a lower rFA of selected WM regions.

Brain DTI of diabetic patients showed reduced FA using tract based spatial statistics in diabetic patients with mild cognitive impairment compared to those without39. A similar analytical method showed a significant decrease in the WM tract DTI metrics in closely related areas to the default mode network in type II diabetic patients compared to healthy controls38. Finally, The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study found a relationship between midlife and late life elevated blood glucose level and worse WM microstructural integrity in late life31. We did not observe a relationship between DM or glucose level and rFA in our cohort. This is likely secondary to the healthy nature of our subjects who are cognitively intact, younger in age and with fewer atherogenic risk factors.

In contrast to diabetes and hypertension, the relationship between WM microstructures other atherogenic vascular risk factors are modest and inconsistent. The ARIC study did not observe a relationship between lipid level at midlife and late life with late life DTI metrics31. However, another study found an association between lipids, especially LDL, and WM microstructure integrity in generally healthy 125 older adults (mean age 68 years)32. BMI was found to be associated with WM microstructure integrity in selected regions of interest in a sample of older healthy community participants (mean age 71.3 years)23. The combination of atherogenic vascular risk factors (2 or more) was associated with longitudinal drop in FA in WM regions compared to no vascular risk factors in elderly subjects (mean age 73.9 years)25. Finally, smoking was associated with increased FA in WM regions in adolescent/young adult smokers in a recent systematic review35. Another study of chronic smokers showed decreased FA of the hippocampus in association with decreased memory performance compared to non-smokers34. In summary, our study cohort is unique as it tests relatively young and healthy group of subjects who are relatives of patients with CAD compared to the majority of the previous literature which evaluated elderly subjects, patients who have advanced vascular risk factors or subjects with cognitive impairments. Our findings point towards hypertension as being the most important risk factor in otherwise healthy subjects at early stages of the disease. The identified WM regions in our study likely play important roles in cognition and memory. The stria terminalis and fornix are critical for normal cognitive functioning and memory40. Its pathology can be found in Alzheimer’s disease. The cingulum is known to play a role in executive control, emotion and episodic memory and it has been implicated in multiple psychiatric diseases and Alzheimer’s disease41. The superior longitudinal fasciculus abnormalities on DTI have been attributed to age related language decline42. Finally, the sagittal stratum carries multiple functional fibers implicated in language and visual function43.

Despite available animal and human data suggesting a mechanistic relationship of hypertension to CSVD, the underlying processes leading to these events are yet to be established4. Arterial stiffness has been closely linked to hypertension and aging. Arterial stiffness results from remodeling of the arterial wall secondary to degradation of elastin and accumulation of collagen and calcium deposition7. Measures of arterial stiffness such as ankle-brachial index have been associated with development of CSVD findings8,9. Additionally it is well known that hypertension is associated with arteriosclerosis which is the main pathologic feature of CSVD, characterized by fibro-hyaline material, narrowing of the lumen and thickening of the vessel wall2. Moreover, hypertension leads to impaired cerebral autoregulation that results in cerebral hypoxia and WM injury44. It is plausible that hypertension plays an important role in early WM damage compared to other atherogenic risk factors in middle-aged apparently healthy subjects45. More recently, an alternative pathway involving disruption of the blood brain barrier leading to CSVD has been heavily investigated 4,44. The exact relationship of hypertension to BBB dysfunction needs to be heavily investigated in the future.

Our study has certain limitations and it should be interpreted within its context. First, given the cross-sectional nature of the study, a mechanistic relationship between the atherogenic vascular risk factors and WM microstructure disruption cannot be ascertained in our sample. Second, more regions of deep WM structures could have been involved in this disease; however, they were not detected given the relatively small sample size. We decided to choose a conservative method for adjustment for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni’s method) despite the distributed nature of the CSVD in the brain as we aimed to avoid any possibility of finding false positive results. In addition, an interaction analysis among vascular risk factors and associated WM damage could not be performed due to the relatively small sample size. Finally, we did not examine the severity of hypertension and blood pressure control at baseline to assess its relationship to severity of WM disease.

Conclusions:

In apparently healthy middle-aged subjects at increased risk for vascular disease, among traditional risk factors hypertension is most closely associated with microstructural WM impairment. These findings promise to have implications in patient care by early selection of subjects who are at risk for future cognitive impairment through identification of these impaired tracts. This may even prove to be of further value as novel therapies are being developed for patients with CSVD.
