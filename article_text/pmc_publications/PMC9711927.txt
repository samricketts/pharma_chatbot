Brain β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition is a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias, in which Aβ amounts correlate with disease burden. McAlpine et al. reveal that astrocyte expression or administration of interleukin (IL)-3 in the context of aggregated Aβ endows microglia with enhanced capability to cluster and clear Aβ oligomers.


pmcAD is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia in the USA. Although the mechanisms causing AD and identification of therapeutic targets to preserve memory function remain elusive, genetic studies have associated disease susceptibility with SNPs in genes involved in host–pathogen interactions and innate immunity, including TREM2 and APOE, and neuropathologic studies of AD patients demonstrate changes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage and aggregates of the APP fragment Aβ, accompanied by hyperphosphorylated tau protein [1–3]. Cortical deposition of Aβ, a biomarker for AD in some individuals, leads to the recruitment of microglia [4], a specialized population of myeloid cells that phagocytose cells and their products in the brain, including synapses, damaged axons, infectious agents, and Aβ. While the cellular processes and networks that manage Aβ amounts are poorly understood, there is evidence to suggest that microglia may remove their aggregates as part of homeostatic mechanisms that maintain brain health [5].

A 1994 study that examined serum protein in age matched-controls versus patients with AD found that IL-3 concentrations (a cytokine that regulates hematopoiesis) were significantly lower in AD versus control patients [6]. Similar studies a decade later defined 18 signaling protein biomarkers, including IL-3, which not only identified AD patients but could also predict disease progression [7]. However, the cellular sources, targets, and functions of IL-3 in central nervous system (CNS) health and disease remain undefined. To address this, McAlpine et al. utilized pharmacologic and genetic approaches including the administration of IL-3 into the CNS of mice and the generation of Il3-deficient mice with either global (Il3−/− or dual reporter/floxed Il3GFPfl/fl) or cell-specific deletion of IL-3 (Il3GFPfl/flAldh1l1creERT2) or its receptor, IL-3Rα (Il3rafl/flCx3cr1creERT25xFAD); the mice were bred onto a murine strain that overexpresses mutant APP and presenilin (5xFAD mice) [8]. In addition, the authors performed ex vivo detection of Aβ40 peptide (a 40 amino acid proteolytic product of APP), behavioral phenotyping, and extensive analyses of microglial responses to IL-3 [8]. The authors reported that astrocyte subpopulations in wildtype and 5xFAD mice constitutively express similar IL-3 amounts, resulting in acute immune responses and motility programs in microglia, as well as reducing Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline in 5xFAD mice relative to mice with global or conditional deletion of IL-3 or IL-3Rα. McAlpine and colleagues provided evidence that microglial expression of IL-3Rα was higher in 5xFAD compared with wild-type animals, required TREM2 expression, and that IL-3Rα signaling increased the expression of TREM2-dependent and microglial immune response genes (such as Spp1, Itgax, Apoe, Lyz2, and Clec7a) relative to controls; these genes were associated with the ability of microglia to cluster around Aβ aggregates, facilitating their clearance, and thereby limiting immunopathology in the mice (Figure 1).

To first determine whether IL-3 is required for normal brain development and health, the authors evaluated blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, neurogenesis, neuronal survival, microglial activation, and behavior in wildtype versus Il3−/− mice and found no differences. To identify a role for IL-3 in Aβ accumulation, the authors assessed 5xFAD versus Il3−/−5xFAD mice; while both groups of mice exhibited no differences in BBB function or numbers of Ly6Chi monocytes, global IL-3 deficiency was associated with impaired memory and increased Aβ40 amounts in 5xFAD relative to Il3−/−5xFAD mice. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid IL-3 derived from wild-type and 5xFAD mice exhibited significantly higher levels than in serum, suggesting local expression of this cytokine within the CNS. The authors therefore performed flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analyses of brain tissues derived from Il3GFPfl/fl and Il3GFPfl/fl5xFAD mice, revealing that ~4% of astrocytes constituted the sole cellular source of IL-3 in both genotypes, and suggesting that AD-like pathology does not alter IL-3 expression, which incidentally was also increased with age. Similarly, IL-3 cellular targets were identified via IL-3Rα detection, noting an age-dependent increase in the percentage of IL-3Rα+ microglia, which were also augmented in 5xFAD versus wild-type mice. Of interest, Trem2 deletion blunted this response in 5xFAD mice – corroborated upon examination of Trem2-dependent genes such as Il3ra and Mhc2 in publicly available datasets.

To correlate these findings with the human CNS, the authors colocalized IL-3 within glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ astrocytes in post-mortem cortical tissues derived from control and AD patients, which also exhibited similar amounts to each other. However, the numbers of IL-3Rα+ microglia and the levels of IL3RA mRNA transcripts were higher in cortical tissues from AD patients and from patients with the AD risk APOEε4/ε4 genotype versus control CNS tissues. IL3RA expression also correlated positively with disease duration and Aβ42 amounts in AD patient tissues, consistent with the authors’ studies utilizing 5xFAD mice [8].

Furthermore, bulk RNA sequencing of microglia harvested from the cortices of 5xFAD and Il3−/−5xFAD mice revealed 309 differentially expressed transcripts [8]. Gene ontology pathway analysis of these transcripts demonstrated that IL-3 deficiency correlated with the abolished activation of microglial genes associated with tissue repair and remodeling, immune response, motility, migration, and morphology. Further examination of the morphological, migratory, and mobilization properties of 5xFAD and Il3−/−5xFAD microglia revealed that IL-3 was required for the generation of rounded morphology, migration to, and clustering around Aβ deposits, but was dispensable for the phagocytic function of microglia or their expression of inflammatory cytokines. These findings were confirmed in vitro utilizing a microfluidic device with a center chamber containing human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes [9] either overexpressing APP (AD astrocytes and neurons), or not, and where microglia were added to the side chambers [8]. IL-3 colocalized within astrocytes and IL-3Rα with microglia, similarly to the findings examining IL-3 and IL-3Rα expression in human AD and mouse 5xFAD cortical tissues. Moreover, microglia migration was significantly increased in cultures containing AD astrocytes plus neurons versus non-AD astrocytes plus neurons, and this migratory activity was further augmented by the addition of recombinant (r)IL-3.

To validate the in vitro findings in vivo, mice with inducible astrocyte-specific deletion of Il3 (Il3GFPfl/flAldh1l1creERT25xFAD) and mice with inducible microglia-specific deletion of Il3ra (Il3raGFPfl/flCx3cr1creERT25xFAD) were compared. Compared with Il3GFPfl/fl5xFAD mice, Il3GFPfl/flAldh1l1creERT25xFAD treated with tamoxifen exhibited increased amounts of cortical Aβ and APP proteolytic products, decreased microglial expression of Trem2-dependent genes such as Apoe, Itgax, Lyz2, Spp1, Igf1, Clec7a, Ctsg, Mmp9, and Ccl8, and memory impairment. Similar results were obtained in Il3raGFPfl/fl Cx3cr1creERT25xFAD versus Il3raGFPfl/fl 5xFAD mice. Of relevance, rIL-3 administration into the cortices of 5xFAD mice, but not into the periphery, resulted in increased microglial migration to and clustering around Aβ, reduced the amounts of cortical Aβ and APP proteolytic products, and improved memory compared with untreated 5xFAD mice [8].

Only a limited number of studies have implicated astrocyte control of microglial functions in the context of neurologic diseases. Indeed, the majority of the data indicate the reverse – that microglia drive neurotoxic or neuroprotective responses in astrocytes [10]. However, a recent study examined how glial interactions within the quadripartite synapse (which includes microglia as functional components together with astrocytes and preand postsynaptic termini) regulate neuronal activity and behavior in mice, and found that astrocyte-derived ATP could drive the extension of microglial processes as well as phagocytosis [11]. These results support the findings from the group of Filip Swirski [8] indicating that astrocytes can modulate the neuroprotective phenotypic states of microglia via secreted factors. Based on these findings, we look forward to additional studies that can uncover the mechanisms that promote microglia up-regulation of IL-3Rα, and that determine whether astrocytic IL-3 impacts on cognitive behaviors via direct effects within the quadripartite synapse.

Figure 1. IL-3 Expression in normal versus Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mouse brains.

Subpopulations of astrocytes express interleukin (IL)-3 in both healthy and AD patient brains. Astrocyte IL-3 concentrations increase with age in both cases, but the increase occurs earlier in AD brain [8]. Activated, but not resting, microglia express IL-3Rα, which induces microglia transcriptional programs associated with specific immune responses that promote microglia migration and clustering around Aβ plaques. Intracortical delivery of recombinant IL-3 (rIL-3) to mouse brains with a heavy Aβ burden improves Aβ clearance by microglia [8].
