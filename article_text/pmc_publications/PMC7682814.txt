Association between the TAR DNA-binding protein of 43kDA (TDP-43), its newly described types (type-α/ type-β) and resilience to Alzheimer’s disease neuropathological change (ADNC) defined as preservation of normal cognitive functioning despite the finding of advanced ADNC has been evaluated in this case-control study of 63 older adults. Twenty-one resilient to ADNC individuals where matched 1:2 to 42 non-resilient (Alzheimer’s dementia) using propensity scores, accounting for age at death, neuritic plaque density and neurofibrillary tangle stage. Resilient and matched non-resilient participants were similar in terms of gender, APOE ε4 carriership, education and occupation, AD and other pathologies. Resilient participants had significantly lower frequency of TDP-43 co-pathology compared to non-resilient participants (19% versus 62%, p=0.002). Among TDP-43-positive cases, TDP-43 type-α inclusions were absent in resilient to ADNC participants and were dominant in matched non-resilient cases (65%, 12/26, p=0.03). TDP-43 and TDP-43 types (type-α and type-β) appears to be one of the key pathological determinants of loss of cognitive resilience to ADNC and hence are important determinants in the understanding of the clinical expression of ADNC.

1. Introduction

The association between Alzheimer’s disease neuropathological change (ADNC) and the clinical syndrome of dementia is stronger in adults under the age of 65 years compared to the oldest old(Savva et al., 2009) with the latter population occasionally remaining normal in terms of cognitive functioning despite a higher than expected ADNC burden (Bennett et al., 2006; Katzman et al., 1988; Savva et al., 2009)– a phenomenon often referred to as ‘cognitive resilience to ADNC’(Arenaza-Urquijo and Vemuri, 2018). Why some individuals with advanced ADNC succumb to the disease whereas others remain symptom-free remains enigmatic and warrants further investigation.

From a pathological standpoint, concomitant pathologies (e.g. Lewy body disease, the TAR DNA-binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43), vascular disease) are frequent and more common in older adults (Robinson et al., 2018b; Wennberg et al., 2019); therefore, they should be considered as potential ‘weight shifters’ towards cognitive decline in otherwise resilient to ADNC individuals. TDP-43, which is associated with memory impairment in ADNC and is more prevalent in older adults(Josephs et al., 2014b; Nelson et al., 2019), is of particular interest. We have previously found some evidence that the presence of TDP-43 increases the probability of cognitive impairment at death in ADNC (Josephs et al., 2008; Josephs et al., 2014b). We also recently reported two different types of TDP-43 in ADNC having differing relationships to genetic, pathological and neuroimaging outcomes(Josephs et al., 2019); it is unclear how TDP-43 type may relate to cognitive resilience. In this study we analyze the contribution of mixed pathologies, particularly TDP-43 and TDP-43 types(Josephs et al., 2019), to the preservation of cognitive resilience in participants with ADNC.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study design and participants

We conducted a clinico-pathological case-control study using participants who were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Patient registry (ADPR) or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) (Roberts et al., 2008), prospectively followed to the time of their death, and had a brain autopsy available. The participants died between 5/12/1999–12/31/2015. From this cohort we identified all participants who met the following inclusion criteria: (1) TDP-43 status and type, where applicable, were determined; (2) the participant had received an intermediate/high ADNC diagnosis according to the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) neuropathological diagnostic criteria (Hyman et al., 2012) (Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage≥IV with moderate/frequent neuritic plaques); (3) the last research diagnosis established by the ADRC, MCSA or ADPR was established ≤3 years before death.

All participants had been clinically evaluated by a board certified behavioral neurologist and neuropsychologist and cognitive status was determined by consensus at their last research visit. Cognitively unimpaired participants were defined as resilient to ADNC. The electronic medical records of all participants classified as resilient to ADNC at their last research visit were further reviewed to ensure that none of them had developed any cognitive impairment between the last research evaluation and the day of death. Specifically, we reviewed all cognitive test scores that were documented, and all clinical impressions and diagnoses rendered by neurological and/or medical examinations after the final research visit. Among the cognitively impaired participants, only those with typical Alzheimer’s dementia (McKhann et al., 2011) were included and classified as non-resilient to ADNC; participants with mild cognitive impairment and non-AD dementias were excluded. Two hundred twenty-seven participants met our criteria. Demographic and lifestyle data (age, gender, education, occupation) were abstracted from charts. Apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 genotyping was performed as previously described(Crook et al., 1994). Transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) genotyping was performed for 17/30 of TDP-43 positive cases who had frozen tissue available for genetic analyses, as previously described (Josephs et al., 2019). Karyotyping was not performed for sex determination.

2.2. Standard protocols approvals, registrations and patient consents

This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board; all participants and/or their proxies signed a written informed consent form before taking part in any research activities in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.3. Pathological analysis

All cases underwent pathological examination according to the recommendations of the NIA-AA(Hyman et al., 2012). Each individual was assigned a Braak NFT stage (Braak and Braak, 1991) and neocortical neuritic plaque density score according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) (Mirra et al., 1991). Presence of Lewy bodies in the brainstem, limbic system, or neocortex was documented and staged according to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (Beekly et al., 2007). We also analyzed only those with a high-likelihood of ADNC, as a secondary analysis, given less power. The likelihood of high pathological ADNC diagnosis was assigned based on consensus recommendations of the NIA and the Reagan Institute Working Group (Disease, 1997). Where the guidelines could not be applied to determine the likelihood, the following modifications where implemented: Braak NFT stage IV and CERAD frequent and Braak NFT stage VI and CERAD moderate were classified as high likelihood ADNC. On the other hand, those with Braak NFT stage V and CERAD moderate were considered to have intermediate-likelihood ADNC and hence were excluded from this secondary analysis.

Cases were designated as TDP-43-positive (TDP-43(+)) if TDP-43 immunoreactivity was identified in the amygdala, the earliest region involved in AD (Josephs et al., 2014a; Josephs et al., 2016). TDP-43 type-α was assigned when TDP-43-immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, dystrophic neurites, and/or neuronal intranuclear inclusions were detected; TDP-43 type-β was assigned when TDP-43-immunoreactivity located adjacent to tau-immunoreactive NFTs was detected (Josephs et al., 2019) (Figure 1).

We also document the presence of hippocampal sclerosis (Dickson et al., 1994), diagnosed if there was neuronal loss in the CA1 and/or the subiculum of the hippocampus out of proportion to the observable burden of extracellular neurofibrillary tangle pathology, based on consensus recommendations (Rauramaa et al., 2013) and argyrophilic grains disease (AGD) if silver and tau-positive spindle-shaped lesions in transentorhinal and entorhinal cortex, amygdala or temporal allocortex were identified (Jellinger, 1998).

Vascular pathology was assessed at the time of autopsy examination for the presence of microinfarcts, lacunar infarcts (&lt;1 cm) and larger infarcts (≥1 cm) (Wennberg et al., 2019).

2.4. Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were done in R version 3.5.3 software and SAS version 9.4. Clinical diagnosis closest to death separated participants into 2 groups: resilient (21 cognitively unimpaired) and 206 non-resilient (with clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s dementia). We performed a logistic regression analysis with resilient to ADNC status as the outcome and age at death, CERAD neuritic plaque density and Braak NFT stage as independent variables to estimate propensity scores. We then matched the 21 resilient participants 1:2 to 42 non-resilient participants using these propensity scores. Two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum and Fisher’s exact tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Effect size estimates are reported as relative differences in proportions for categorical variables or area under the ROC curve for continuous variables. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. A separate analysis was performed for the subset of participants with high-likelihood of ADNC.

3. Results

Demographic, genetic, occupational and pathological characteristics of all the participants are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. The only characteristic that clearly differed between resilient and matched non-resilient participants was the frequency of TDP-43(+) status and distribution of TDP-43 type. Resilient participants had a significantly lower frequency of TDP-43 co-pathology (19%) compared to non-resilient participants (62%) (relative difference in proportions: 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 – 0.69; p=0.002). Among TDP-43(+) cases, the resilient and matched non-resilient participants also differed in terms of TDP-43 type. Specifically, resilient to ADNC participants had exclusively TDP-43 type-β inclusions (4/4), whereas the TDP-43(+) non-resilient participants had type-α inclusions in 65% of cases (17/26) (p=0.03). There was a trend observed showing that higher proportion of resilient to ADNC participants (67%) practiced professional specialty during the lifetime compared to match non-resilient participants (40%); this finding, however, did not reach statistical significance (p=0.06).

When we assessed the subset of cases with high-likelihood ADNC (n=13), TDP-43 was still the only statistically different pathological variable between resilient and non-resilient cases (p=0.036). Resilient to ADNC and non-resilient participants still differed in terms of TDP-43 morphological type (p=0.04) (Table 3). TDP-43 was also the only variable that was different between resilient and non-resilient cases in the remaining intermediate-likelihood cases (n=8, p=0.037).

4. Discussion

In this case-control study we tested the hypothesis TDP-43 is much more common in non-resilient older adults with advanced ADNC compared to their resilient counterparts and indeed that is what we found. Moreover, we report a novel finding regarding the distribution of newly described TDP-43 morphological types in resilient and non-resilient to ADNC patients. TDP-43 type-α is the predominant TDP-43 type in non-resilient to ADNC and is not detected in cases of resilience to ADNC. Therefore, TDP-43 type-α appears to be one of the pathological determinants of loss of resilience to ADNC. Further, although not as strongly associated, TDP-43 type-β also appears to be a risk factor for non-resilience.

The findings of this study fortify the importance and implication of TDP-43 and TDP-43 types in not only the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, ADNC specifically, but also the clinical presentation of the disease. The current findings expands our previous observation where we first discussed that the absence of TDP-43 was strongly associated with normal cognition despite comparable ADNC among TDP-43(+) and TDP-43(−) participants. In our previous study, however, we did not strictly apply criteria for, or formally assess the relationship between TDP-43 and cognitive resilient to ADNC (Josephs et al., 2014b). Our initial observation has been confirmed by the report of association between TDP-43 and lowered threshold of clinical expression of Alzheimer’s-type dementia in a large autopsy cohort study from another center(James et al., 2016). Independent contributions of co-pathologies to cognitive decline have been reported(White, 2009) and two recent studies that assessed co-pathologies in resilient and demented older adults also found a higher prevalence of TDP-43 in demented participants(Latimer et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2018a).

We now further these results by showing the importance of TDP-43 morphological type. TDP-43 type-α appears to be particularly associated with the presence of Alzheimer’s dementia, while participants with preserved cognition are more likely, if not exclusively, to be type-β. This might be related to the tendency of type-α to also have a higher TDP-43 stage and greater hippocampal atrophy than type-β(Josephs et al., 2019). It might also be related to the TMEM106B protective and risk haplotype distribution given that we previously identified an association between TDP-43 types and haplotypes (Josephs et al., 2019). Unfortunately, due to limited power from a small number of participants having TMEM106B haplotype determined, we were unable to perform a robust statistical analysis with haplotypes. Difference in distribution of TDP-43 types between resilient to ADNC and matched non-resilient participants adds a clinical distinction between TDP-43 types in ADNC to an already existing list of demographic, genetic, pathological, and neuroimaging differences(Josephs et al., 2019).

The relatively large cohort size for this rare phenomenon (i.e. cognitive resilience) and extensive phenotyping are the strengths of this study. Propensity score matching of the resilient and non-resilient participants eliminates confounders and increases the robustness of our findings. Though we only matched for age and ADNC, our cohort is relatively harmonized for cerebrovascular disease as well, a frequent co-pathology in the elderly which is known to be a contributor to cognitive decline (Robinson et al., 2018a; Schneider et al., 2007). However, there are a few limitations to be considered. We used semi-quantitative Braak NFT staging for estimation of tau accumulation whereas a more quantitative method such as the density of NFT could be more robust for normalization of ADNC between the groups; similarly, Thal phases would be complementary if not more informative for estimation of amyloid deposition than CERAD neuritic plaque density. Lastly, here we concentrate on pathological determinants of resilience to ADNC whereas the process itself is most likely multifactorial with education, social and physical engagement, emotional stressors and ethnical differences also possibly contributing to cognitive resilience to ADNC (Kaup et al., 2015; Negash et al., 2013). Our finding of differences in professional occupation at the trend level is supportive of this theory; however, a prospective cohort study design with more detailed evaluation is more appropriate for investigation of association between these factors and cognitive resilience to ADNC.

5. Conclusions

Unravelling cognitive resilience to ADNC could lead to better understanding of the key pathologies that drive cognitive decline. From a pathological standpoint, cognitively resilient to ADNC individuals are less likely to be TDP-43(+); however, when they are, they are most likely to have TDP-43 type-β inclusions which might be a more benign variant of TDP-43-proteinopathy compared to type-α. Differences in TDP-43 type distribution between cognitively resilient to ADNC and demented patients prompts further and more granular investigation of TDP-43 contribution to cognitive impairment.

APOE ε4, apolipoprotein E ε4 allele; CERAD, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease; CI, confidence intervals; n/a, not applicable; NFT, neurofibrillary tangle; TMEM106B, transmembrane protein 106B; TDP-43, transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa.

a Effect sizes for age at death and education are areas under the ROC curve while effect sizes for other variables are relative differences in proportions;

b For categorical variables, p-values are from Fisher’s Exact test; for continuous variables, p-values are from Wilcoxon Rank Sum test

c All resilient participants except for n=1 had clinical assessment of cognitive functioning reported as normal within 1 year prior to death

d TMEM106B genotyping was performed for 10/15 TDP-43 positive cases

Highlights

Case-control study of 63 resilient and non-resilient to Alzheimer’s disease adults

TDP-43 is 3.3 times more frequent in the non-resilient versus resilient patients

TDP-43 type-α was the predominant type in the non-resilient patients

All TDP-43-positive, resilient patients, only had TDP-43 type-β inclusions

TDP-43 type is important in understanding the clinical expression of ADNC
