Background

Longitudinal studies of older adults are characterized by high dropout rates, multimorbid conditions and multiple medication use, especially proximal to death. We studied the association between multiple medication use and incident dementia diagnoses including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VD), and Lewy-body dementia (LBD), simultaneously accounting for dropout.

Methods

Using the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center data with 3-years of follow-up, a set of covariate-adjusted models that ignore dropout was fit to complete-case data, and to the whole-cohort data. Additionally, covariate-adjusted joint models with shared random effects accounting for dropout were fit to the whole-cohort data. Multiple medication use was defined as: polypharmacy (≥ 5 medications), hyperpolypharmacy (≥ 10 medications) and total number of medications.

Results

Incident diagnoses were 2032 for AD, 135 for VD and 139 for LBD. Percentages of dropout at end of follow-up were: 71.8% for AD, 81.5% for VD, and 77.7% for LBD. The odds ratio (OR) estimate for hyperpolypharmacy among those with LBD versus AD was 2.19 (0.78, 6.15) when estimated using complete-case data and 3.00 (1.66, 5.40) using whole-cohort data. The OR reduced to 1.41 (0.76, 2.64) when estimated from the joint model accounting for dropout. The OR for polypharmacy using complete-case data differed from the estimates using whole-cohort data. The OR for dementia diagnoses on total number of medications were similar, but non-significant when estimated using complete-case data.

Conclusion

Reasons for dropout should be investigated and appropriate statistical methods applied to reduce bias in longitudinal studies among high-risk dementia cohorts.

Introduction

Longitudinal studies of older adults with comorbid conditions are characterized by two main features. First, missing data is common, especially when older adults are followed for a long period (Lavikainen et al., 2015). Second, older adults often have multiple medical comorbidities resulting in multiple medications use (Lau et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2017). Older adults experience varying beneficial and harmful effects of multiple medications. Additionally, with advanced age, use of multiple medications may contribute to adverse events, such as functional decline (Lau et al., 2010), falls, fractures, hospitalization, cognitive impairment, and poorer clinical outcomes (Hilmer and Gnjidic, 2009).

Capturing medication use accurately in studies of older adults can be challenging. This is because missing data patterns in outcomes of medication use, can either be (i) monotonic (due to attrition/dropout including death), that is, when a participant does not participate in any subsequent follow-up assessments after dropping out of study or (ii) intermittent, that is, when a participant returns to a subsequent follow-up having not participated in one or more previous follow-up assessments (Gavin and Myers, 2003; Shardell et al., 2013). Here, we define missing data patterns for dropout (i.e., for monotonic missingness). Missing data by dropout can follow three well-known mechanisms (Little, 1995; Rubin, 1976). First, missing data can occur completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of dropout does not depend upon the observed outcomes, such that there is no difference in the characteristics of those with incomplete data and those with complete data (Chan, 2016). Second, dropout can occur at random (MAR) if the probability of dropping out depends on the observed outcomes and covariates at some time before dropping out, but not on the unobserved outcomes during or after dropout (Chang et al., 2009; Little, 1995). Lastly, missing data by dropout can be non-ignorable/informative, that is, missing not at random (MNAR) if the probability of a participant dropping out depends on their unobserved data (outcome and covariates) at the time of dropout.

Missing data is common and problematic in studies of older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia. Participants with dementia may drop out due to several reasons, such as death, inability to continue participating given their worsening conditions, or due to them relocating outside the study areas (Gao, 2004). Generally, participants with multiple conditions are more likely to die than disease-free participants, and if covariates to account for this are not collected, the missing data may be non-ignorable. This suggests that missing data by death may be associated with the disease status and may lead to biased estimates. Moreover, because older adults with multimorbid conditions often take multiple medications concomitantly, the effect of disease on the use of medications for participants who dropped out of study may differ systematically from participants who completed the study (Chang et al., 2009). When faced with such missing data complexities, some investigators analyze only complete-case data, under the assumption of MCAR. However, this approach can lead to biased conclusions and loss of power to detect significant associations, and is often unrealistic (Lavikainen et al., 2015).

Dementia is becoming increasingly common in older adults and it typically occurs in the setting of multimorbidity. There is emerging evidence that medication use may differ by common types of dementia. However, there is no consensus on whether individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are healthier than individuals with other types of dementia (Eaker et al., 2002; Imfeld et al., 2013). Therefore, the likelihood of dropping out may vary due to different medication profiles for underlying conditions and dementia types. As persons approach the end of life they tend to have higher burden of diseases and medication to treat these conditions. Currently, there is limited research on the impact of dropout on the associations between dementia diagnosis and medication use. Dropout may lead to underestimation/overestimation of the associations; therefore, it is important that investigators account for dropout to ensure unbiased estimation of effects.

The aim of this research is to study the longitudinal association between medication use and incident diagnosis of three common types of dementia: AD, vascular dementia (VD), and Lewy-body dementia (LBD) simultaneously accounting for dropout due to death and other reasons for persons aged 65 years and older using data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC).

Methods

Study design

The data used in this study were obtained from NACC. Detailed description of the NACC cohort is available elsewhere (Beekly et al., 2007; Weintraub et al., 2009). In brief, NACC was established in 1999 to facilitate research related to Alzheimer’s disease. This cohort includes participants with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders, participants who are cognitively normal and those with mild cognitive impairment. Participants were enrolled through Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) based in universities and other institutions in the United States. The NACC was established by funding from the National Institute on Aging. Participants underwent a comprehensive cognitive, behavioral, and functional assessment at their initial study visit and at annual follow-up visits until they were deceased or declined to further participate in the study.

Study sample

This sample included participants who had an incident dementia diagnosis at one of their follow-up assessments. Participants with an incident diagnosis of dementia were followed from the visit in which they were diagnosed with dementia (baseline) for up to three years. Participants were excluded if they were: (1) &lt; 65 years old at the time of incident dementia diagnosis; (2) had a diagnosis of dementia at their initial visit (prevalent dementia); (3) had only one NACC assessment; (4) were not diagnosed with dementia during the follow-up period, or had a primary dementia diagnosis of other pathology. Participants were deemed to have dementia if they met the standard criteria for dementia of the Alzheimer’s type or for other non-Alzheimer’s dementing disorders based on comprehensive neuropsychiatric battery or cognitive assessment with a trained ADC clinician (Beach et al., 2012; Mirra et al., 1991). This analysis used data from 34 ADCs. In this study, we included incident dementia cases only for the three mutually exclusive groups based on the clinician’s determination of their primary etiology of dementia at the time of their incident dementia diagnosis: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (McKhann et al., 1984): a participant was considered to have AD if they met the criteria for dementia and had probable AD as the primary clinical diagnosis based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.

Vascular dementia (VD): we included participants identified with stroke, probable VD, possible VD or any significant vascular brain injury as the primary cause of dementia.

Lewy-body dementia (LBD): included participants with LBD listed as the primary etiologic diagnosis on the Uniform Data Set clinician diagnosis form.

The analytic sample includes 2,306 participants who enrolled in NACC between 2005 and 2014 and had an incident diagnosis of AD (n=2,032), VD (n=135), and LBD (n=139) after enrolment. We used three years of follow-up assessments after incident dementia diagnosis for these participants as presented in Supplementary Figure 1.

Medication exposure

Medication use assessment included a count of all medications a participant reported taking at each annual visit, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements, and vitamins (Morris et al., 2006). We further dichotomized the reported total number of medications at each assessment using two commonly used cutoffs: concomitant use of 5 or more medications (hereafter, polypharmacy (Fried et al., 2014; Gnjidic et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2017; Sganga et al., 2015)), and concomitant use of 10 or more medications (hereafter, hyperpolypharmacy) and assessed the effect of three dementia types on polypharmacy, hyperpolypharmacy, and on the total number of medications.

Covariates

Covariates that may be related to medication use, dementia type or dropout included age, gender, race (white versus non-white), cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, pace maker, congestive heart failure, or other cardiovascular disease), diabetes (type 1 or type 2), depression, and psychiatric disorders.

Statistical methods

Descriptive statistics

We explored study participation and causes of dropout over the three-year follow-up. We examined systematic differences in the baseline (visit of incident dementia diagnosis) characteristics between participants who completed the three-year follow-up (hereafter, completers) and those who did not complete the study (hereafter, non-completers) using proportions for categorical variables and means for continuous variables, and tested the differences using Pearson Chi-square and F tests, respectively. The MCAR assumption may be violated if there are significant differences in participants’ characteristics between non-completers and completers. We further explored the following four dropout patterns: (i) those with baseline data only, (ii) those with baseline and one-year follow-up data, (iii) those with baseline, one-year and two-year follow-up data, and (iv) those with complete data for the three-year follow-up period. The means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for these four groups were plotted by follow-up year to explore systematic differences between them. We further explored medication use over the three-year follow-up period for the whole cohort using means (and standard deviations) for the total number of prescription medications, and proportions for polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy. Lastly, we explored the MAR assumption by assessing whether the probability of dropout at a given time point is predicted by the number of medications reported at the previous time point and other observed baseline characteristics using logistic regression.

Statistical modeling

First, we used separate models that estimate the effects of dementia types on medication use and ignore the dropout component. Then, we used joint models with shared random effects to model the association between medication use and dementia types (Gao, 2004; Vonesh et al., 2006). The joint model accounts for informative dropout. These models are described below.

Separate mixed effects models

We fit two naïve mixed effects (fixed covariate effects and random intercept) models that ignore specification of the dropout model in estimating the effect of dementia types on medication use (polypharmacy, hyperpolypharmacy and total number of medications). First, we fit a mixed effects model to data for those who completed the three-year follow-up study (hereafter, separate model-complete case). Note that the separate model-complete case assumes MCAR, implying that participants who did not complete the three-year follow-up study do not differ from participants who completed the study in terms of their characteristics. Second, we fit a mixed effects model to the data from the whole cohort (hereafter, separate model-whole cohort). Note that the separate model-whole cohort assumes MAR. These separate models assume ignorable dropout, and that the association between dementia types and medication use does not depend on the probability of dropout. For total number of medications, we fit a Poisson mixed effects model adjusted for covariates previously listed, and for polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy we fit logistic mixed effects models adjusted for covariates previously listed.

Longitudinal joint shared parameter model for medication use and dropout

Unlike separate mixed effects model, a longitudinal joint shared random effect model provides an intuitive approach in modeling the association between dementia types and medication use, simultaneously accounting for dropout due to death and other factors. The joint shared random effects modeling approach has the following advantages. First, it can handle informative dropout when the probability of dropout depends on the unobserved outcome at the time of dropout. Second, joint modeling can handle intermittent missing data patterns, and lastly, the joint modeling approach can be applied if participants do not follow the same follow-up schedule; for instance, when participants have different interview intervals. It is common for the number of medications and a participant’s probability to dropout to be related through observed participant’s characteristics, such as disease status, gender, age, and through their unobserved characteristics. In the joint model, medication use (polypharmacy, hyperpolypharmacy and total number of medications) and dropout are modeled jointly conditional on a participant’s observed characteristics (listed above) and unobserved shared random effects. The shared random effects quantify the unobserved quantities that underlie a participant’s probability to use multiple medications or to dropout. We illustrate the joint shared parameter model for polypharmacy and informative dropout. We denote polypharmacy reported at jth annual visit for the ith participant by Polyij, and a set of a participant’s characteristics, namely, VD, LBD, depression (dep), diabetes (diab), gender (female = 1, male = 0), age (65–84 years versus 85 years or older), race (white versus non-white), cardiovascular disease (cardio_dis, present versus absent) and psychiatric disorders (psychia, present versus absent) by Xij; the dropout indicator is denoted by Dropij. The joint shared parameter model for polypharmacy and dropout is defined by Prob(Polyij=1|Xij′,μi)=φ(α0+α1VDij+α2LBDij+α3depij+α4diabij+α5femalei+α6ageij+α7white_racei+α8cardio_disij+α9psychiaij+μi)

Prob(Dropij=1|Xij′,μi)=φ(β0+β1VDij+β2LBDij+β3depij+β4diabij+β5femalei+β6ageij+β7white_racei+β8cardio_disij+β9psychiaij+λμi),

where μi~N(0,σu2) is the shared random effect that represents the unobserved factors underlying a participant’s susceptibility to polypharmacy and to dropping out of the study; λ is a scalar multiplier that quantifies the random effects on the probability of a participant to drop out (Gao, 2004); αi′s and βi′s quantify the effects; for instance α1 for VD quantifies the odds of those diagnosed with incident VD to report polypharmacy relative to the odds of those diagnosed with AD; φ is an inverse logit function. These models were fit in SAS version 9.4 and using NLMIXED procedure.

Results

Descriptive measures

In Table 1, descriptive measures for active, lost and dead participants over the three-year follow-up are presented. Missing data is evident with only 28.2 % of study participants with AD, 18.5 % with VD, and 22.3 % with LBD still active in the study three years after incident diagnosis of dementia.

In Table 2, baseline characteristics are compared between non-completers and completers and the differences between them tested using Pearson Chi-square for the categorical variables and F test for the continuous variables. Of the 2306 participants, 21.9% (n=504) completed the three-year follow-up study. Further, there is no significant difference between completers and non-completers by dementia diagnosis (all p &gt; 0.05). Completers and non-completers differ significantly by gender (p = 0.010), age (p &lt; 0.0001), total number of medications (p = 0.009), and diabetes (p = 0.030), suggesting a potential violation of MCAR assumption.

In Figure 1, the unadjusted means (95% CI) for total number of medications are plotted for each dropout pattern over the three-year follow-up period. Participants with baseline values only have the lowest mean number of medications (mean = 7.3) as compared with the means from the other groups (range: 8.3–8.5). Among participants with one, two, and three years of follow-up data, there is no significant difference in their total number of medications, as shown by the overlapping 95% CIs.

Descriptive measures for medication outcomes by dementia type are presented in Table 3. Most participants had incident AD. The unadjusted mean number of medications and percentages for polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy, respectively, increase over the three-year follow-up for participants with incident diagnosis of AD and VD. The unadjusted mean number of medications, percentage with polypharmacy for participants diagnosed with VD and LBD are higher than for participants diagnosed with AD.

Statistical modeling

Parameter estimates from the two separate models and joint models that quantify the odds and risk ratios of medication use for persons with VD or LBD relative to AD are presented in Table 4.

Separate model-complete case compared to separate model-whole cohort

The models fit to the dataset provide similar associations to the unadjusted values in Table 3—those diagnosed with either VD or LBD were more likely to take more medications than those diagnosed with AD. The parameter estimates from the separate model fit to complete three-year follow-up data only (separate model-complete case) are systematically different, with non-significant associations for VD or LBD relative to AD for all medication use outcomes, and larger standard errors than those from the separate models fit to the whole-cohort data set. Additionally, the associations of either VD or LBD with total number of medication became significant when estimated using separate model-whole cohort.

Separate model-whole cohort versus joint shared parameter model

Using estimates from the joint model, the odds of a person with incident VD having polypharmacy is about 1.5 times higher than the odds of a person with incident AD reporting polypharmacy. Using the whole-cohort data, we observe appreciable differences in the effect estimates from separate models and joint models, mainly for polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy. For instance, the odds of a person with LBD reporting hyperpolypharmacy is 3 times significantly higher than the odds of a person with AD when dropout is ignored; the odds ratio reduces to 1.41 and even becomes nonsignificant when estimated from the joint model that accounts for the dropout. In contrast, the risk ratio estimates for the association between dementia types and total number of medications from the separate model and joint model do not differ substantially. Lastly, participants who are male, white race, had a diagnosis of depression in the past two years, had diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases were more likely to report taking multiple medications than their counterparts (Supplementary Table 1).

Susceptibility to dropout

The variability in the shared random effects ( σu2) that represents unobserved factors is significant in all models for all medication outcomes and increases when total number of medication is dichotomized using either a cutoff of 5 or 10. For instance, the variance of the unobserved factors that jointly underlie a participant’s susceptibility to polypharmacy and to dropout is 5.87. Further, the multiplier (λ̂) that quantifies the effect of unobserved factors on a participant’s susceptibility to dropout is significantly different from zero (p &lt; 0.05) for all outcomes. For example, the log odds ratio that quantifies the effect of unobserved factors to dropout is −1.54 when dropout is jointly modeled with polypharmacy. These estimates had wide confidence intervals leading to non-significant but higher odds of dropout among those diagnosed with VD and LBD relative to those diagnosed with AD (Table 4, last column). Similarly, participants aged 85 years and older were more likely to drop out (Supplementary Table 1).

Discussion

We studied the association between three common dementia diagnoses and medication use, and demonstrated a joint modeling approach to account for missing data patterns. Using the whole-cohort data, we found that older adults who were diagnosed with either incident VD or LBD were more likely to use multiple medications than those diagnosed with incident AD. Furthermore, participant’s susceptibility to dropout due to unobserved factors was significant for all medication outcomes.

Missing data by attrition is often inevitable in longitudinal studies of older adults (Lavikainen et al., 2015). Usually, participants drop out of study not in a completely random manner but for some reason. However, attrition can be associated with many factors that might themselves be under investigation in the study (Gao, 2004). In this study, participants who were either 85 years and older, had diabetes or cardiovascular disease had higher odds of dropout (Supplementary Table 1). Specifically, the odds of a participant aged 85 years and older to drop out was about 10 times relative to the odds of those aged 65 to 84 years. This finding is in line with previous studies; for instance, in a longitudinal study of older persons aged 49 years and older by Van Beijsterveldt et al. (2002), higher rate of attrition by death was found to be associated with male gender, older age and poor cognitive performance. In this analysis, the systematic differences in some baseline characteristics between completers and non-completers could suggest a violation of MCAR assumption. In such cases, participants who drop out often differ systematically from those who complete the study, and this difference may lead to biased conclusions, as suggested in this study and in previous studies (Lavikainen et al., 2015; Touloumi et al., 2001). In the NACC dataset, there was a nonsignificant positive association between the number of concomitant medication reported at the previous visit and the probability of dropout at the subsequent visit; this association might suggest the dropout mechanism to be MAR. Additionally, the association of comorbid conditions with the probability of dropout evidenced in this study could indicate a non-ignorable dropout. The analysis showed significant parameter estimate that quantifies the association between unobserved random effects and dropout. A negative value for this parameter could be interpreted as a ‘protective’ effect of these latent factors to dropout, whereas a positive value could be construed as a risk factor to dropout. This parameter was negative for polypharmacy and total number of medications, but became significantly positive for hyperpolypharmacy. We posit this reversal of sign could be due to a cutoff shift from 5 to 10, leading to increased frequency in the reference group (i.e., participants taking less than 10 medications) in the outcome variable.

There is substantial difference in the point estimates for the effect of dementia diagnosis on polypharmacy and hyperpolypharmacy usage outcomes from complete case analysis as compared with the estimates obtained by accounting for missing data. The substantial difference in the point estimates may be construed as a pointer to the amount of bias in the effect estimate attributable to missing data. The amount of bias can only be determined through a simulation study, where the true effect is known (Burton et al., 2006; Chan, 2016). However, a simulation study is beyond the scope of this paper.

Even though there is no established method to distinguish between MAR and MNAR, the judgement can be based on experience or by conducting a sensitivity analysis (Moreno-Betancur and Chavance, 2016). Dropout is typically related to a person’s health conditions, thus, ignoring dropout may lead to too optimistic conclusions. Therefore, it is important to identify the cause of missing data and use appropriate modeling techniques when faced with missing data problem. For investigators analyzing longitudinal studies with non-trivial amounts of missing data, it is recommended that the factors attributing to attrition be investigated, and to analyze data under both ignorable and non-ignorable missing data assumptions, when the missing data mechanism is unknown (Lavikainen et al., 2015).

The shared random effect model used here has the following strengths. First, it can handle informative attrition. Second, it can handle unobserved factors that may lead to a person’s likelihood to use concomitant medications or to drop out. Third, it is flexible because it is not limited to dropout missing data patterns only. Lastly, the shared parameter model can be implemented in standard statistical software, such as in SAS using NLMIXED procedure as is the case in this study and can also be fit in R using JM and joineRML packages. Despite these strengths, this study has a few limitations. First, the NACC data repository is not a representative national sample; therefore, the findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Second, assessments occur at one-year intervals and do not capture changes between visits, but common chronic conditions were included as these are indicating conditions for medication use. Third, although we used a large observational study with rigorous diagnostic tests for dementia type and a systematic method for collecting all medications, causality cannot be inferred; however, the dropout mechanism was estimated using the prior year’s medication data providing temporality. Fourth, although NACC systematically collected data on all types of medication at each visit, data on the dose and frequency of these medications were not collected. Fifth, NACC included both prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins and supplements; therefore, the effects of these medications cannot be separated. Finally, the number of participants with dementia diagnoses other than AD was low, but not unexpected, which might lead to larger standard errors of parameter estimates that quantify the effects. However, VD and LDB are less common in the population and have different pathology; thus, patients may be treated for both underlying causes and concomitant diseases, warranting investigation into medication usage.

In conclusion, investigators should ensure maximum retention of study participants to minimize missing data; if this is inevitable, as is the case in most longitudinal studies of older adults with dementia, the reasons for missing data should be ascertained and appropriate statistical methods should be used to handle informative missingness to reduce bias in the risk estimates of interest. Recording dose and frequencies would allow estimation of standardized dose effects, while recording severity of disease would allow modelling of medications by disease indication and severity.
