OBJECTIVES:

To examine associations between alcohol use and cognitive performance among older adults in Greece and the United States, and assess potential differences due to differing drinking practices in the two countries.

METHODS:

Data came from Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) and National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Dataset (NACC). We examined those aged 65–90 years at baseline who had no cognitive impairment and complete data for cognitive and alcohol use variables (N=1,110 from HELIAD; N=2,455 from NACC). We examined associations between current alcohol use and frequency of such use with cognitive performance on various cognitive tasks stratified by gender.

RESULTS:

In NACC, use of alcohol was associated with better cognitive performance. Men drinkers performed better than non-drinkers on Trail A (standardized mean 0.07 vs. −0.24, p&lt;.001), Trail B (0.06 vs. −0.19, p=.001), and women drinkers performed better on Trail A (0.04 vs. −0.09, p=.016), Trail B (0.04 vs. −0.10, p=.005), verbal fluency (Animals: 0.05 vs. −0.13, p&lt;.001; Vegetables: 0.04 vs. −0.09, p=.027), and MoCA (0.03 vs. −0.08, p=.039). In HELIAD, fewer differences were seen with only women drinkers exhibiting better performance than non-drinkers on the Boston Naming Task (0.11 vs. −0.05, p=.016). In general, more frequent drinkers performed better on cognitive tasks than less frequent drinkers, although this was only statistically significant in the NACC dataset.

DISCUSSION:

While drinking alcohol may be associated with better cognitive performance across both the US and Greece, more research is needed to assess the cultural factors that may modify this association.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alcohol consumption practices differ across countries,1, 2 and these between-country variations are seen across a number of populations, including older adults.3, 4 One study by Calvo et al. compared alcohol use patterns of those age 50+ years across 22 countries and found substantial variations in drinking3—older adults, for example, in higher-income countries consumed more alcohol than those in middle-income countries. As alcohol use may influence older adults’ health—especially for those who take multiple medications or have chronic health conditions—it is vital to better understand how alcohol consumption in late life may be related to health and functioning.

Past research has examined relationships between alcohol use and cognitive health. In a scoping review, Rehm et al. found that while heavy alcohol use was linked with poorer cognitive outcomes, light to moderate alcohol use was associated with lower risk of cognitive impairment and dementia diagnosis.5 Past research has shown moderate alcohol consumption to be related to better global, executive, and visual cognitive functioning.6, 7 As variations and drinking patterns are observed across countries, it is possible that the cultural context in which the drinking occurs may influence observed relationships between alcohol consumption and cognition. For example, in Greece, persons often grow up consuming alcohol at meals from a young age and engage in alcohol consumption under adult and family guidance.8 Notably, it has previously been shown that in Greece, alcohol consumption primarily occurs during meal times9 while at home.10 Additionally, wine is the predominant alcoholic beverage consumed in this country.10 In the U.S., drinking practices are more diverse, with some more conservative populations abstaining from all alcohol consumption,11 while other populations consume alcohol only in social settings.12 Notably, in the U.S., disparities in drinking patterns have been observed by race/ethnicity,13 religiosity,14 and neighborhood characteristics.15 As examples, American Indian populations report more alcohol use problems than Asian Americans,13 and those attending religious services consume less alcohol than those who do not.14 Understanding the health factors related to culturally-influenced drinking practices may improve our understanding of the harms and potential benefits of alcohol use on cognitive health and inform the development of interventions targeting unhealthy substance use in older populations.

In this study, we examined the cross-sectional relationship between current alcohol use and cognitive functioning in older adults without cognitive impairment in Greece and the United States. Based upon prior literature,16–21 we hypothesized that a) alcohol consumption and greater drinking frequency would be associated with better cognitive functioning in both Greece and the U.S., and b) these associations would be stronger in Greece.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data sources

We used data from the Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD) study from Greece, and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set from the U.S.

Hellenic Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet.

HELIAD is a population-based longitudinal cohort study of community-dwelling older adults residing in Greece. Subjects were randomly selected from the Athens suburb of Marousi and the city of Larissa and were interviewed in person in various settings, including the participants’ homes, clinics, and daycare centers. Information about the design and conduct of this study can be found elsewhere.22 HELIAD received Institutional Review Board approval from the Institutional Ethics Review Board at the University of Thessaly.

National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set.

NACC is a database curated and updated by the NIA-funded National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center at the University of Washington. The database consists of de-identified clinical and neuroimaging data of participants seen in 32 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers across the U.S. These centers recruit individuals with mild dementia, mild cognitive impairment and healthy older adults and follow them longitudinally, obtaining clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging measures at periodic intervals. The development of NACC has previously been described elsewhere.23, 24 These data are freely available to those associated with an ADRC and can be obtained at the following website: https://www.alz.washington.edu. All contributing sites obtain Institutional Review Board approval from their respective institutions.

Participants

We focused on participants from HELIAD and NACC who were age 65–90 years at the baseline visit and had complete data on cognitive tests and alcohol use variables. As we were interested in understanding associations among those with normal cognition, we excluded subjects from analysis with known cognitive impairment or self-reported Alzheimer’s medication use. The final analytic sample included 1,110 (456 men, 654 women) from HELIAD, and 2,455 participants (835 men, 1,620 women) from NACC.

Measures

Alcohol use.

HELIAD participants were asked whether they were current alcohol users and how frequently they drank Tsipouro, beer, wine, and whiskey. NACC participants were asked whether they had consumed any alcohol in the past three months and how often they had consumed at least one serving of alcohol (wine, beer, malt liquor, or spirits) during that time period. As only alcohol use frequency was inquired about in NACC, our analysis focused on current overall alcohol use (yes vs. no) and alcohol use frequency.

Cognitive assessments.

Cognitive performance was ascertained by assessments examining a variety of cognitive domains. Both HELIAD and NACC included Category Fluency scores25 (objects for HELIAD, and animals and vegetables for NACC) as a measure of semantic and verbal fluency, Trail Making Test A as a measure of processing speed, and Trail Making Test B as a measure of executive attention. HELIAD also included the Mini-Mental State Examination,26 as a measure of global cognition and orientation and a Greek version of the Boston Naming Test short form27 as a measure of language. NACC also included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA),28 measuring overall cognitive impairment, and the Benson Complex Figure Copy and Benson Delayed Reproduction,29 measures of visuospatial constructional ability and nonverbal memory.

Other covariates.

Additional demographic, lifestyle and health history characteristics were gathered in HELIAD and NACC. HELIAD obtained information on gender, years of education, marital status, ever smoking, coronary disease, diabetes, hypertension, illicit drug use, and difficulty sleeping. NACC similarly obtained information on participant gender, years of education, marital status, history of smoking &gt; 100 cigarettes, heart attack, stroke, hypertension, illicit drug use, and sleep disorders (apnea, REM sleep behavior disorder, and other).

Data harmonization procedures

To ensure comparability of results between cohorts, we categorized alcohol use frequency in HELIAD and NACC into a 4-level variable (i.e., none, less than once per week, 1–4 times per week, and daily or almost daily). Additionally, to standardize cognitive assessment scores, we converted all cognitive test scores into sex and cohort-specific z-scores using mean and standard deviation of the final analytic sample. Standardized scores of Trail Making Tests A and B were inverted so that in all tests, a higher z-score indicates better performance.

Statistical analyses

Participant characteristics were described using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and N and percent for categorical variables. The cross-sectional association between alcohol use (yes/no and frequency) and cognition was tested using General Linear Models in each study cohort, and least-squares means of alcohol use frequency categories were calculated and compared pair-wise. Within HELIAD and NACC, we fit two multivariate models: a base model and an extended model. The HELIAD base models were adjusted for age, education, marital status, and smoking history; extended models were additionally adjusted for coronary disease, hypertension, diabetes, and sleep disorder. The NACC base models were adjusted for age, education, marital status, smoking history, and illicit drug use; extended models were additionally adjusted for heart attack, stroke, hypertension, and sleep disorders. Due to the well-documented literature identifying gender differences in drinking patterns,30–32 all models were conducted separately for men and women. For frequency analyses, we computed a p-for-trend to assess linearity of associations across frequency levels. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;.05. All analyses were conducted with SAS 9.4.

RESULTS

Participant characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Age was similar in men and women in both HELIAD and NACC (mean age ranged between 71.0 and 73.0). Mean years of education were lower for both men and women in HELIAD (men: 10.4, women: 9.1) than NACC (men: 16.9, women: 16.1). In NACC, alcohol use was reported at similar rates in men and women (men: 77%, women: 71%); however, 68% of men in HELIAD reported alcohol use compared to only 29% of women. Performance on cognitive tests was similar for men and women in both HELIAD and NACC. Mean performance on Trail Making Test A and Trail Making Test B was higher in HELIAD compared to NACC for both men and women (see Table 1).

In HELIAD, alcohol use (yes/no) was only associated with better cognitive performance on Boston Naming Test for women (standardized mean 0.11 vs. −0.05, p=.016) (Table 2a). In NACC, alcohol use (yes/no) was associated with better performance on Trail A (standardized mean 0.07 vs. −0.24, p&lt;.001) and Trail B (standardized mean 0.06 vs. −0.19, p=.001) in men. In women, alcohol use was associated with better performance on Trail A (standardized mean 0.04 vs. −0.09, p=.016), Trail B (standardized mean 0.04 vs. −0.10, p=.005), Verbal Fluency (animals) (standardized mean 0.05 vs. −0.13, p=.001), Verbal Fluency (vegetables) (standardized mean 0.04 vs. −0.09, p=.027), and MoCA (standardized mean 0.03 vs. −0.08, p=.039) (Table 2b). Adjustment for additional covariates in extended models did not change results appreciably (data not shown).

Analysis of alcohol use frequency revealed significant associations on select cognitive tests in both HELIAD and NACC (Tables 3a and 3b). Specifically, in HELIAD, we observed no linear relationships between drinking frequency and cognitive performance among men. Drinking frequency in women was associated with better performance on MMSE (p-for-trend=.003) and Boston Naming (p-for-trend=.027). In extended models, the association between drinking frequency with MMSE and Boston Naming remained significant (data not shown). In NACC, drinking frequency among men was associated with better performance on Trail A (p-for-trend&lt;.001) and Trail B (p-for-trend&lt;.001). In women, drinking frequency was associated with better performance on Trail A (p-for-trend=.006), Trail B (p-for-trend&lt;.001), Verbal Fluency (animals) (p-for-trend&lt;.001), Verbal Fluency (vegetables) (p-for-trend=.002), and MoCA (p-for-trend=.004). All associations remained significant in extended models for men, while the associations of drinking frequency and Trail A and MoCA were attenuated in the extended models for women (data not shown).

Figures 1a and 1b show the adjusted mean standardized scores by alcohol use frequency categories for men and women in HELIAD and NACC, respectively. Significant pair-wise differences between categories are noted in each figure.

DISCUSSION

Our goal was to examine the association between alcohol use and cognitive performance among older adults in Greece and the U.S. and explore any differences in these associations between the two countries. Two main findings emerged. First, drinkers in the U.S. exhibited better performance than non-drinkers in several cognitive tasks, including Trail A and B, verbal fluency, and MoCA. These associations were stronger among more frequent vs. less frequent drinkers. Second, there were fewer differences in cognitive performance between drinkers vs. non-drinkers in Greece, although women drinkers performed better on the Boston Naming Task than their non-drinking counterparts. Like in the U.S., better cognitive performance was seen in more frequent vs. less frequent drinkers, although these differences were primarily seen in women.

We were surprised to find fewer associations between alcohol use and cognition in Greece. While findings from the U.S. cohort largely confirmed previous studies showing regular and moderate drinking to be associated with better cognitive health,6, 16–21, 33 we had hypothesized that this same trend would be seen in our Greek cohort. The Mediterranean diet, which can include foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, and includes wine, is typical in Greece, and a growing body of research has identified adherence to the diet as a protective factor against cognitive decline in older adults.34, 35 Aside from the wine consumption, it is likely that non-drinkers are consuming similar foods linked with favorable cognitive functioning than drinkers, and this may be attenuating any differences in cognition between groups. Further, we have no data on past drinking and it is possible that a subset of the non-drinkers are former drinkers. To explore this issue further, future research in Greek samples may seek to identify any effect modification of adherence to the Mediterranean diet on the relationship between alcohol use and cognition.

Despite fewer differences in cognition between drinkers and non-drinkers in the Greek cohort, we did notice interesting sex differences. We found some protective effects of drinking on cognition in women whereas there were no associations in men. Previous research has shown that Greek men drink more and in larger quantities than Greek women.36 Indeed, literature suggests that Greek women decrease alcohol quantity as they age.37 Thus, the observed sex differences may be explained by a greater number of Greek men consuming alcohol up to a harmful limit. Indeed, Bellos et al., in a population-based study of the Greek population, found that men were substantially more likely than women to experience alcohol-related problems.38 It may be helpful for future studies to identify any gender-specific cultural factors within Greece that explain these sex differences.

Our study’s findings should be interpreted within the context of its limitations. First, we examined cross-sectional relationships between alcohol consumption and cognitive performance, and analyses were not conducted longitudinally. Future research examining differences in cognitive trajectories over time in a variety of countries is necessary, especially to identify important time points for intervention. Second, we did not have necessary alcohol use measures that could be harmonized across datasets, including type of alcohol, quantity, volume, and drinking context. As such, we were unable to identify individuals who consume alcohol in an unhealthy manner (e.g., binge drinking, meeting criteria for an alcohol use disorder, etc.), a risk factor for cognitive impairment. Third, we did not have harmonized data on past drinking behaviors. Data characterizing lifetime drinking patterns may have helped us identify which prior drinking behaviors are most related to current cognitive health. Fourth, the studies included in our analysis were conducted in different languages (i.e., Greek for HELIAD and English for NACC). Differences in study question interpretation might have impacted our results, particularly cognitive performance testing related to word meaning (e.g., verbal fluency). Fifth, the HELIAD and NACC sampling procedures were different—HELIAD was a population-based sample in Greece, and NACC was a convenience sample of participants who volunteered for a longitudinal research study. In NACC, participants had higher education, and may thus engage in more healthy drinking behaviors which may not be reflective of the general U.S. population. However, our results are in line with prior findings from more representative U.S. samples regarding beneficial associations of alcohol use and cognitive performance.6, 16–21, 33 Finally, as this was an analysis of secondary data, we were limited to variables available in both datasets. As such, we were unable to account for important confounds including socioeconomic status, religion and cultural beliefs, among others.

Overall, we found associations between alcohol use and cognitive performance among older adults, but these results were more pronounced in the U.S. than in Greece. Future research should examine these associations utilizing data with richer alcohol use measures (e.g., quantity consumed, the timing of drinking, and presence of alcohol use disorders) and information about the context of drinking (e.g., with whom they drink, whether alcohol is consumed with meals, attitudes about, and history of, alcohol use). As drinking use patterns differ across the world, understanding their impact on cognitive functioning may help inform recommendations on drinking practices to preserve global cognitive health in later life.
