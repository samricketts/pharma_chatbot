Background

Hemorrhagic and ischemic MRI lesions as well as the more recently described decrease in vasomotor reactivity have been suggested as possible biomarkers for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Analyses of these markers have been primarily cross-sectional during the symptomatic phase of the disease, with little data on their longitudinal progression, particularly in the presymptomatic phase of the disease when it may be most responsive to treatment. We used the unique opportunity provided by studying Dutch type hereditary Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (D-CAA) to determine longitudinal progression of CAA biomarkers during the presymptomatic as well as the symptomatic phase of the disease.

Methods

In this longitudinal case-control study, MRI markers and cognitive performance were assessed at baseline and after approximately 4 years in 10 presymptomatic and 6 symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, and 20 control subjects. These MRI markers included hemorrhagic and ischemic manifestations, measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vasomotor reactivity to visual stimulation.

Results

In presymptomatic D-CAA mutations carriers, vasomotor reactivity showed a decline over time for BOLD amplitude (p=0.011) and prolongation of time to peak (TTP) (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, no significant changes in hemorrhagic markers, ischemic markers, CBF and cognition were found. In symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, the number of intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) increased over the 4-year period (p=0.007).

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that in the presymptomatic phase of D-CAA, cerebrovascular reactivity measured by the BOLD amplitude and TTP to visual stimulation progressively worsens and can thus be regarded as a disease progression marker. In the symptomatic phase, the most salient marker of progression appears to be recurrent ICH.

Graphical Abstract


pmcIntroduction

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common type of small vessel disease (SVD) in the brain that is caused by deposition of amyloid-β in small to medium-sized cerebral blood vessels and leptomeningeal arteries 1–3. CAA is an important cause of spontaneous lobar intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the elderly, and a contributor of age-related cognitive decline and dementia. The ‘modified Boston criteria’ allow the diagnosis of possible or probable CAA in living persons based on the location and presence of (small) hemorrhagic lesions in the brain. Still, a definite diagnosis of CAA requires histological or post-mortem evaluation 4. Population-based autopsy data indicate a CAA prevalence of 20–40% in nondemented elderly populations, which increases to 50–60% in demented elderly populations 5. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), CAA is identified in up to 98% of the cases when sought diligently 6. Unfortunately, to date, there is no disease-specific CAA treatment and management of CAA patients is focused on the prevention of recurrent hemorrhagic events 7. In this respect, the development of disease-specific CAA treatment is severely hindered by the absence of early biomarkers reflecting disease progression.

Current MRI markers of CAA include both hemorrhagic and ischemic changes. Hemorrhagic manifestations include the presence of lobar cerebral microbleeds (MBs), ICHs, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH) 8, 9. Ischemic manifestations include greater volumes of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) 10, 11, cortical microinfarcts [11] or acute ischemic brain lesions 12, 13. More recently, the presence of MRI-visible dilated perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (DPVS-CSO) 14–18 and decreased vasomotor reactivity 19–21 have also been put forward as CAA marker. Analyses of these markers been primarily cross-sectional during the symptomatic phase of the disease, however, with little data on how their longitudinal progression, particularly in the presymptomatic phase of the disease when it may be most responsive to treatment. In symptomatic patients with CAA, it was suggested that progression of white matter lesions, hemorrhages, or worsening of cSS could be a biomarker for assessing disease severity 22, 23.

Dutch type hereditary CAA (D-CAA, also called Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage With Amyloidosis-Dutch type [HCHWA-D]), an autosomal dominant form of CAA, can be used as disease model to study CAA with minimal confounding comorbidities associated with ageing, other small vessel diseases, and potential other neurodegenerative disorders. In D-CAA, a Glu693Gln point mutation leads to extensive amyloid-β deposition in the meningocortical arterioles. This occurs without parenchymal deposition of amyloid-β plaques as in AD 24, 25. In D-CAA the chemical composition and underlying pathology of the amyloid deposits as well as the hemorrhagic and ischemic radiological manifestations are similar to that in sporadic CAA 26, 27. The development of symptoms (recurrent ICH and cognitive impairment) in D-CAA patients occurs relatively early in life, usually between the age of 50 to 60 years. That is in contrast to sporadic CAA, which is mainly seen in elderly over 65 years old. By using D-CAA as a disease model, the progression of MRI markers can be established, even in the presymptomatic phase of the disease without a large influence of age-related effects. This allows the search for an early biomarker that progresses over time, even before the disease becomes symptomatic.

Previously, we reported classic markers, and potential new markers in D-CAA mutation carriers analyzed at a single cross-sectional timepoint 21, 28. The aim of the present study is to establish the longitudinal progression of these CAA markers in presymptomatic and symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers and to search for early biomarkers for disease progression in the presymptomatic group. We hypothesize that vasomotor reactivity, previously shown to be decreased in presymptomatic D-CAA 21, worsens over time and therefore could be a candidate biomarker for demonstrating effects on disease progression during the presymptomatic phase of CAA.

Participants

We performed this longitudinal case-control study between April 2017 and July 2018, at the Department of Radiology of the Leiden University Medical Center (Leiden, Netherlands). For a patient flow diagram please see Supplementary figure I (https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/str.) Subjects enrolled in the baseline study21, 28 were selected via the HCHWA-D patient association in Katwijk (the Netherlands) and the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology of the Leiden University Medical Center. Control subjects were selected from individuals at risk for D-CAA, but who tested genetically negative and from subject spouses, family or friends. The general practitioners of all participants who were enrolled in the baseline study 21, 28, performed between May 2012 and October 2013, were approached to check whether participants were still alive. All living participants were invited for a follow-up visit. At baseline, 60 participants were included: 27 D-CAA mutations carriers (12 presymptomatic and 15 symptomatic) and 33 control subjects. Presymptomatic was defined as having no symptomatic ICH in medical history. All participants enrolled in the study underwent genetic testing. Detailed inclusion criteria have been described previously 21, 28. At follow-up 36 participants were included: 10 presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carries (83% from baseline), 6 symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers (40% from baseline) and 20 control subjects (61% from baseline). The presymptomatic mutation carriers had a mean age of 38.5 years (SD 12.3) at follow-up, three were male and seven were female. The symptomatic mutation carriers had a mean age of 58.5 years (SD 3.1), two male and four female. Controls had a mean age of 48.4 years (SD 16.1), eight male and twelve female. The medical ethics committee of the Leiden University Medical Center approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The procedures followed were in accordance with institutional guidelines.

MRI

Image acquisition

Imaging was performed on the same MRI scanner (3T Philips Medical Systems, Best, Netherlands) with exactly the same protocol as used at baseline 21. No relevant hard- or software-upgrades have been made to the scanner in the 4-year follow-up interval. 3D T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery scan (FLAIR), T2*-weighted images, pseudo continues arterial spin labeling scans (pcASL) and visually stimulated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans were obtained with similar parameters as used at baseline 21, 28. The visual stimulus consisted of 16 blocks of an 8Hz flashing radial black and white checkerboard pattern for 20 seconds alternated with 28 seconds of gray screen, as described previously 19.

Image analysis/processing

Hemorrhagic markers were assessed on T2*-weighted images. Lobar MBs (location as described by the Boston criteria 29) were defined and scored as described previously 30. ICHs were defined as parenchymal defects with evidence of hemosiderin in their wall. The number and presence of convexity SAHs was assessed described as a subarachnoid bleeding localized to the convexities of the brain 31. The presence of cSS was described as linear residues of blood in the superficial layers of the cortex, and classified as focal (3 or less sulci) or disseminated (4 or more sulci) 8. DPVS were evaluated and assessed in the basal ganglia (BG) and centrum semiovale (CSO) on axial T2-weighted images in line with STRIVE (standards for research into small vessel disease) definitions 32. DPVS-BG were rated according to a 1 to 4 point semi-quantitative score as previously described 33. DPVS-CSO were rated according to a 0 to 4 point semi-quantitative score 34. Presence of lacunar infarcts was assessed using T2-weighted and FLAIR images as described earlier 35. The Fazekas scale (0 – 3) was calculated as the mean of periventricular white matter (PVWM) and deep white matter (DWM), both assessed using FLAIR images according to a 4-point rating scale 36. The total brain MRI burden of SVD in CAA (0 – 6), a compound score of lobar MBs, cSS, DPVS-CSO and WHHs, was scored 37. WMHs were defined and analyzed using a semiautomated and validated method using FLAIR images as described previously 38. Pseudo continuous ASL was used to determine the mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) for the brain as whole and for four cortical areas separately (frontal, occipital, parietal and temporal) 21. BOLD fMRI scans using a checkerboard stimulus were used to determine the BOLD amplitude, time to peak (TTP), and time to baseline (TTB), as described previously 19.

Cognitive and neuropsychiatric function

All participants performed standardized neuropsychological testing at baseline and at follow-up. Global cognitive functioning was assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 39. Memory was evaluated using the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) 40 and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) 41. Psychomotor speed was assessed using Trail Making Test (TMT) part A 42. For testing of executive function TMT part B 42, Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) of the WAIS III 43 and Clock drawing were used. Language was evaluated using letter and category fluency 44 and the Boston Naming Test (BNT) 45. Also neuropsychiatric tests included the assessment of apathy, using the Apathy Scale of Starkstein 46, anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) 47. Raw scores of the tests were used, except for the WMS “memory quotient” which was conventionally transformed into a scaled score.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS, version 25.0). Differences between controls and mutation carriers (presymptomatic and symptomatic) in demographic variables at baseline and follow-up were analyzed using univariate general linear modeling (GLM) analysis for the normally distributed continuous variables, Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. To asses within-subject longitudinal change in demographic variables paired sample t-test were used for normally distributed continuous variables and McNemar’s test for dichotomous variables. Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparison were applied.

Our primary objective is to asses within-subject longitudinal change in MRI parameters and cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests between baseline and follow-up. Therefore, paired sample t-tests were used for normally distributed continuous variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for non-normally distributed continuous variables and categorical variables. In the symptomatic D-CAA group only 3 subjects were included at follow-up with regard to vasomotor reactivity parameters, therefore within-subject longitudinal change was not assessed for these parameters.

For our secondary analysis, restricted to the presymptomatic mutation carrier group, we compared within-subject longitudinal change between presymptomatic mutation carriers and controls in candidate markers from our primary analysis. Within-subject change (delta scores) were calculated for each subject by subtracting the value at baseline from the value at follow-up. To compare the within-subject longitudinal change between groups univariate general linear modeling (GLM) analysis was used, with group and sex as fixed factor and age at baseline and interscan time interval as covariates.

Additionally, we performed multivariate linear regression model analyses to test for associations between candidate markers from our primary analysis and possible predictors at baseline. First, all possible predictors were entered into the model as independent variables. Secondly, a stepwise backward analyses was conducted to remove predictors with a low discriminant value.

All p-values are expressed uncorrected. We did not use a correction for multiple comparison for our primary and secondary objective due to our small and exploratory dataset where many of the outcomes covary with each other. In this respect, borderline significance were treated with care.

Results

Inclusion

Of the 60 participants at baseline, 4 symptomatic patients had died and 2 symptomatic patients were admitted to a nursing home during the follow-up period. Of the 54 remaining participants, 10 presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, 6 symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers and 20 controls consented to participate in the follow-up study. Mutation carriers and control subjects who were included in the follow-up study did not differ in demographics with those who did not participate in the follow up study (data not shown). Table 1 shows all demographic parameters of the participants that were included in the follow-up study. Mean follow-up time was 4.2±0.9 years. At baseline 1 control subject reported a transient ischemic attack in in medical history and 1 presymptomatic mutation carrier reported traumatic brain injury. One control subject reported meningitis between baseline and follow-up. None of the presymptomatic mutation carriers reported neurological symptoms between baseline and follow-up. There were no differences in demographic data among presymptomatic D-CAA, symptomatic D-CAA, and controls, but age.

MRI measurements

Vasomotor reactivity parameters at baseline and follow-up of the control, presymptomatic D-CAA and symptomatic D-CAA group are shown in table 2. In the symptomatic D-CAA group 3 out of 6 subjects had missing vasomotor reactivity data. The other MRI characteristics at baseline and follow-up of the three groups are shown in supplementary table I - III. Please see https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/str.

Longitudinal changes

Control subjects

In controls, WMHs increased over time: from 2.5 to 3.8 cm3 (p=0.021). DPVS in the CSO increased slightly over the 4 year period (p=0.046). Perfusion decreased over time in the occipital lobe from 42.1 to 39.1ml/100gr/min (p=0.001), but not in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobe nor whole brain (supplementary table I, please see https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/str). Concerning the vasomotor reactivity measurements; TTP was slightly prolonged after 4 years: from 7.8s to 8.6s (p=0.002). BOLD amplitude and TTB were not altered (table 2). Other MRI markers showed no significant differences over time.

Presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers

In presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, vasomotor TTP was considerable prolonged over time: from 8.4s to 11.5s (p&lt;0.001) and BOLD amplitude demonstrated a small longitudinal decline (p=0.011). No longitudinal changes in TTB were observed (table 2). Other MRI markers showed no significant differences over time (supplementary table II, please see https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/str). Figure 1 shows a typical example of the shape of the hemodynamic response curves in the occipital lobe after checkerboard visual stimulation for a presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carrier and a control subject determined at baseline and follow-up. Figure 2 shows the individual datapoints for vasomotor reactivity measurements at baseline and follow-up.

Symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers

In symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, the number of ICHs (p=0.007) and cSAH (p=0.042) showed an increase over time. CBF was slightly decreased over time in the frontal lobe (p=0.025), parietal lobe (p=0.012) and whole brain (p=0.011). No CBF changes were observed in the occipital or temporal lobe. Other MRI markers showed no significant differences over time (supplementary table III, please see https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/str).

Secondary analysis in presymptomatic mutation carriers

To further asses the changes over time in vasomotor reactivity parameters in presymptomatic mutation carriers, within-subject longitudinal changes (delta scores) were determined for the three vasomotor parameters: BOLD amplitude, TTP and TTB. The within-subject longitudinal change of presymptomatic mutation carriers was compared with the change over time in controls. Table 3 shows the mean longitudinal change for presymptomatic mutation carriers and controls. Both groups showed a decline of BOLD amplitude over time, however the decline in presymptomatic mutation carriers is larger than in controls (p=0.003). A similar finding was seen for TTP. Both groups showed a prolongation of TTP, but the change over time is larger for presymptomatic mutation carriers (p=0.003). No difference between groups was found for TTB.

Moreover, a multivariate linear regression model with backward elimination was built to test the association between vasomotor reactivity progression and possible predictors (sex, interscan interval and baseline parameters; age, WMHs, MBs and DPVS-CSO). We found no associations between possible predictors and vasomotor reactivity progression (BOLD amplitude, TTP and TTB).

Cognitive and neuropsychiatric function

Supplementary table IV shows the corresponding neurocognitive data for the three groups at baseline and follow-up. Please see https://www.ahajournals.org/journal/str.

Longitudinal changes

We found no significant change over time for cognitive or neuropsychiatric scores in any of the groups (controls, presymptomatic and symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers).

Discussion

The primary objective of this study was to assess within-subject longitudinal change in MRI parameters. This study shows that vasomotor reactivity, measured by changes in BOLD response after a visual checkerboard, is a sensitive marker for disease progression in the presymptomatic phase of D-CAA. In this phase of D-CAA none of the other markers showed changes over time. In the symptomatic phase of the disease, only ICH severity showed worsening over time.

The most important finding of our study is that in the presymptomatic phase of D-CAA vasomotor reactivity parameters change over time. Our data show a decrease in BOLD amplitude and a prolongation of TTP over a 4-year period. Control subjects also show a prolongation of TTP over time, however secondary analysis show that the prolongation of TTP is substantially larger in presymptomatic mutation carriers than in controls. A previous study showed a decrease in BOLD amplitude in symptomatic patients with probable CAA over a 1-year period 48. Our study, however, is the first to describe such findings of progressive worsening of vasomotor reactivity in individuals with CAA without symptoms and largely without hemorrhagic markers both at baseline and follow-up. This suggest that the changes seen in BOLD response over time are primarily caused by changes in the vessel wall and possible accumulation of amyloid β, rather than structural damage due to hemorrhagic events. This is further supported by the lack of association between vasomotor reactivity progression and MRI markers at baseline. Cerebrovascular reactivity measured by the BOLD amplitude and TTP can thus be regarded as a disease progression marker in the presymptomatic phase of CAA.

In the symptomatic D-CAA group only 3 subjects were included at follow-up with regard to vasomotor reactivity parameters, therefore study power was too low to interpret findings in this group.

The second important finding of this study is that in the symptomatic phase of D-CAA, of all markers investigated, only ICH seemed to be a valuable progression maker. Our data showed a significant increase in ICHs over time in symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers. This adds to the finding of a follow-up study in which 36% of sporadic CAA patients developed recurrent ICH in a mean follow-up time of 5 years after initial ICH 49. In presymptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers no longitudinal differences in hemorrhagic markers were found. Our findings indicate that hemorrhagic markers, although valuable as disease markers for CAA in the symptomatic phase of the disease, appear to be less sensitive for disease progression in the presymptomatic phase. In the symptomatic phase aggravation of ICHs appears to be the most sensitive hemorrhagic marker for disease progression

We found no increase of WMHs over time in presymptomatic mutation carriers, but did in controls subjects. Although, the absolute increase of WMHs was slightly larger in presymptomatic mutation carriers (5.3 to 7.3 ml) than in control subjects (2.5 to 3.8 ml). In symptomatic mutation carriers we also found no significant increase of WMHs, but a large absolute increase was seen (48.7 to 67.8 ml). Our findings probably suffer from the relative small sample size. Our previous study showed that WMHs were already more prevalent in the presymptomatic phase of D-CAA when compared to controls 28 and another study found a substantial increase of WMHs in patients with probable CAA over a 1-year period 10. Therefore longitudinal research with larger groups is necessary to further asses the progression of WMHs, especially in the presymptomatic phase of CAA.

Our data show no longitudinal changes of the DPVS-CSO, Fazekas, or total SVD score in CAA in presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers. However, interpretation of the change over time of these MRI markers are severely hindered by a ceiling effect of the categorical scale used to assess them. In symptomatic mutation carriers an increase over time could not be determined since almost all symptomatic mutation carriers were already in the highest categories at baseline. This reflects an important limitation of the use of categorical scales to assess disease progression. To draw conclusions about the value of DPVS-CSO as CAA biomarker, volumetric measurements as performed in an earlier study of Martinez Ramirez (2018) would be necessary 18. Summarizing, our findings indicate that the semi-quantitative measurements of DPVS-CSO, Fazekas and total SVD score in CAA are not sensitive for disease progression of CAA.

Perfusion markers showed no longitudinal change in presymptomatic mutation carriers. In symptomatic mutation carriers we found a decrease in the frontal and parietal lobe and brain as whole. Perfusion in the occipital lobe decreased both in symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers (33.0 to 28.9 ml/100g/min) and in controls (42.1 to 39.1 ml/100g/min). However, only for the control group this change was statistically significant, which probably is the result of the small sample size of the symptomatic group. Our findings of decreased perfusion at follow-up in symptomatic mutation carriers are in line with a previous study showing a decreased cerebral perfusion in patients with probable CAA 50. Reduced perfusion could be the result of progression of ICHs and reduced blood flow to damaged tissue. Taken together, our findings suggest that determination of perfusion is likely less suited for being a progression marker in de presymptomatic phase.

Our data do not show significant cognitive decline in the presymptomatic or symptomatic D-CAA mutation carriers, indicating that cognitive measurements cannot be regarded as sensitive markers for disease progression in CAA. The present study, although being a pilot study, suffers from especially the relatively small sample size. Our follow-up time of 4 years can be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, for future drug trials the follow-up time is too long to determine applicable progression markers. On the other hand, the follow-up time is too short to investigate converters into the symptomatic phase of the disease. Another limitation is that we investigated D-CAA, and the generalizability of our findings to sporadic CAA remains to be established as it occurs in older individuals in which there are comorbid changes caused by ageing, other small vessel diseases and neurodegenerative disorders.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that the most sensitive marker for disease progression in the presymptomatic phase of CAA is vasomotor reactivity measured by the BOLD amplitude and TTP after a visual stimulus. Hemorrhagic markers, although valuable as disease markers for symptomatic CAA, appear to be less sensitive for disease detection and progression in the presymptomatic phase of the disease. As the disease becomes symptomatic monitoring of the progression of ICHs is warranted.
