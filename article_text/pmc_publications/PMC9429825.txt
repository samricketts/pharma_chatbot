This systematic review presents an overview of the existing dementia care models in various ambulatory care settings under three categories (i.e., home- and community-based care models, partnership between health systems and community-based resources, and consultation models) and their impact on hospitalization among Persons Living with Dementia (PLWD). PRISMA guidelines were applied, and our search resulted in a total of 13 studies focusing on 11 care models. Seven studies reported that utilization of dementia care models was associated with a modest reduction in hospitalization among community-residing PLWD. Only two studies reported statistically significant results. Dementia care models that were utilized in specialty ambulatory care settings such as memory care showed more promising results than traditional primary care. To develop a better understanding of how dementia care models can be improved, future studies should explore how confounders (e.g., stage of dementia) influence hospitalization.

pmcCurrently, in the United States, dementia affects 5.8 million people, most of whom are 65 and older (Langa et al., 2017). This number is expected to reach 7.1 million by 2025 and 13.8 million by 2050 (Hebert et al., 2013). As the number of Persons Living with Dementia (PLWD) is growing, the use of health care services by this population segment is soaring (White et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2015). The presence of dementia is significantly associated with increased hospitalizations or inpatient admissions (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). Furthermore, the presence of dementia is also increasing the use of health care services among chronically ill individuals (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). PLWD with a concurrent diagnosis of chronic comorbidities (i.e., congestive heart failure [CHF], diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], cancer, or stroke) use more health care services compared to those with no dementia diagnosis and with the same chronic comorbidities (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020).

The most common reasons for hospitalization among PLWD are falls, ischemic heart disease, gastrointestinal disease, pneumonia, and delirium (Phelan et al., 2012; Rudolph et al., 2010). Some of these hospitalizations are due to Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC) illnesses that are potentially avoidable with better access to and quality of ambulatory care (Gao et al., 2014). According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s (AHRQ, 2011) specification, pneumonia, diabetes, hypertension, asthma, CHF, and COPD are associated with the highest rates of potentially avoidable hospitalizations (Fingar et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2017; Phelan et al., 2012). Managing these conditions in PLWD is complex and remains a challenge, as people living with more severe dementia, are unable to accurately and timely report exacerbation of symptoms and rely on family/friend and professional caregivers for their health management. Specifically, due to deficits in memory, language, and judgment ability, PLWD often face difficulties reporting symptoms, adhering to medication, reporting medication side effects, and complying with treatment and follow-up recommendations (Gual et al., 2018; Nelis et al., 2019). Therefore, it is unsurprising that PLWD have almost twice the likelihood of all-cause and ACSC hospitalizations and longer length of stay compared to those without dementia (Lin et al., 2013).

Frequent hospitalizations are of particular concern for PLWD as they are at 7% greater risk of dying during hospitalization than individuals without dementia (Beydoun et al., 2015). The negative impact of hospitalization extends even after discharge, as PLWD frequently do not return to their baseline level of functioning (Covinsky et al., 2003). Also, hospitalizations are the second most costly source of health care utilization among PLWD (Alzheimer’s Association, 2019). The average annual payment for hospitalization per Medicare beneficiary with dementia is $11,306 compared to $3652 per Medicare beneficiary without dementia (Alzheimer’s Association, 2019). Lastly, although not much is known about emotional costs of hospitalizations for PLWD and their families, a qualitative study showed that hospitalizations are related to emotional distress (Sadak et al., 2017). This toll is likely to be significantly exacerbated during the COVID19 pandemic, when families are not allowed to visit and when the likelihood of recovery is further compromised by infectious diseases. Therefore, it is crucial to identify ways to safely minimize hospitalizations to reduce adverse health consequences and expenditures.

Community-residing PLWD are more likely to be hospitalized compared to those residing within institutions (e.g., skilled nursing or memory care facilities) (Feng et al., 2014). Care delivery for PLWD in the community involves a broad range of practitioners, including physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), registered nurses (RNs), neuropsychologists, and allied health care professionals such as occupational and physical therapists and home health aides (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). Yet, most ambulatory care providers do not receive dementia training, and the numbers of practitioners specializing in care of older adults are declining (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). For instance, the United States is projected to have only 6200 geriatricians by 2025 despite needing approximately 33,000 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). Due to the shortage of providers and the growing dementia population, there are ongoing efforts to create innovative care models for PLWD.

More specifically, to reduce hospitalizations among community-residing PLWD, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease seeks to explore the effectiveness of new care models to enhance dementia care quality and efficiency (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020). Such models focus on proactive chronic disease management, maximizing patient function and independence, and supporting caregivers in reducing strain. These care models aim to reduce unnecessary costs, such as ACSC hospitalizations, through improved care in ambulatory care settings (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the utilization of the existing dementia care models in various ambulatory care settings and synthesize the evidence to provide a summary of their impact on all-cause and ACSC hospitalizations and the lengths of stay among community-residing PLWD in the United States.

Methods

Data Sources and Searches

This systematic review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009). Two authors (V.H. and A.B.) searched for publications in three databases: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo. The search strategy entailed medical subject headings (MeSH) and database-specific subject headings to identify relevant studies using keywords such as “dementia,” collaborative“ dementia care,” disease“ management,” and “hospitalization.” Furthermore, a hand search of 15 high-impact factor journals (e.g., American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Journal of the American Geriatrics Society) related to the aging research was also completed. Our methodology allowed us to conduct a comprehensive literature search on dementia care models to show their effect on hospitalization among community-residing PLWD in ambulatory care settings. This comprehensive literature search was conducted between February and June 2020 (See Appendix 1 for detailed information about the keywords).

Eligibility for Full-Text Review

We included studies that (1) focused on community-residing PLWD, (2) focused on hospitalization, (3) were published in English, (4) were based in the United States, (5) not restricted by publication date, and (6) were peer-reviewed. We excluded studies if they focused on PLWD residing in nursing homes. Editorials, abstracts, systematic and narrative reviews, and qualitative studies were also excluded.

Study Selection

The initial search resulted in 602 studies. The studies were imported into Mendeley, a citation manager software, and then exported to Covidence, online software developed for systematic review management. The authors (V.H. and A.B.) used Mendeley to find duplicates and Covidence for screening titles and abstracts. In total, 140 duplicates were removed, and 479 titles and abstracts were screened. After screening titles and abstracts, a total of 413 articles were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Figure 1).

A full-text review was conducted on the remaining articles (n = 66). Many articles (n = 53) were excluded for the following reasons: (1) focused on PLWD in hospital or nursing home settings (n = 21), (2) excluded dementia diagnosis (n = 17), (3) focused on international studies (n = 10), (4) reported qualitative findings (n = 2), and (5) focused on systematic reviews (n = 2). The remaining studies (n = 13) were eligible for data extraction and quality appraisal. Author names, publication year, setting of the care model, design of the study, sample size, name of the model, and hospitalization information were extracted and included in Table 1.

Quality Appraisal

Two authors (V.H. and A.B) used two tools, including the Cochrane Collaboration tool and the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale, to evaluate the included articles’ risk of bias. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the potential sources of bias in randomized control trials ([RCT]; Higgins et al., 2011). The Cochrane Collaboration tool includes seven domains of bias: (1) random sequence generation (selection bias), (2) allocation concealment (selection bias), (3) blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), (4) blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), (5) incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), (6) selective reporting (reporting bias), and (7) other types of bias. RCT studies were grouped into three levels as “low risk of bias,” “high risk of bias,” or “unclear risk of bias.” Two reviewers assessed the quality of each RCT study independently and resolved conflicting results through discussion.

The authors (V.H. and A.B.) also used the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort and case-control studies to assess the risk of bias in the included studies (Peterson et al., 2011). Divided across eight specific items, this tool contains three sections: (1) selection (n = 4 items) assesses the representativeness of the exposed cohort and the non-exposed cohort, ascertainment of exposure, and demonstration that at the start of the study, the outcome of interest was not present; (2) comparability (n = 1 item) evaluates whether there were any adjustments for confounding variables; and (3) outcome (n = 3 items) is based on the follow-up period and cohort retention ascertained by independent blind assessment, record linkage, or self-report. Each item in the selection and outcome sections can be awarded one point, except for comparability, which can be scored up to two points. The maximum number of points a study can receive is nine. Cohort and case-control studies with less than five points were identified as having a “high risk” of bias.

Results

Characteristics and Quality Appraisal of the Studies

Overall, 13 studies describing 11 unique care models were included in this review. Nine were RCTs, (Amjad et al., 2018; Bass et al., 2003, 2015; Callahan et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2004; Dorr et al., 2008; Duru et al., 2009; Possin et al., 2019; Samus et al., 2014), three were cohort studies (Clevenger et al., 2018; Daaleman et al., 2019; Noel et al., 2017), and one was case-control (Jennings et al., 2019). The majority (n =9) of the RCTs did not provide adequate details about randomization or blinding to determine if they had a high or low risk of bias. After reviewing the cohort and case-control studies, scores ranging from seven to nine were given for quality appraisals. Studies with higher scores have higher quality and lower risk of bias compared to studies with lower scores. Overall, based on the scoring manual for Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale, all cohort and case-control studies included in this systematic review were of good quality.

Eleven studies focused on care models designed for PLWD specifically (Amjad et al., 2018; Bass et al., 2003, 2015; Callahan et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2004; Clevenger et al., 2018; Duru et al., 2009; Jennings et al., 2019; Noel et al., 2017; Possin et al., 2019; Samus et al., 2014), and two studies used models for older adults with various chronic conditions including dementia (Daaleman et al., 2019; Dorr et al., 2008). The sample size in the included studies ranged from 139 to 3,432, and the studies were published between 2003 and 2019 (see Table 1).

Across 13 studies, we identified three categories based on the setting of the models (i.e., home- and community-based care models [n = 5], partnership between health systems and community-based resources [n =4], and consultation models [n = 4]). Below we describe the dementia care models and their influence on hospitalization and present the models by category.

Home- and Community-Based Care Models

Our review identified the most common care models as home-based coordination interventions (Amjad et al., 2018; Daaleman et al., 2019; Duru et al., 2009; Samus et al., 2014) and one telephone/internet-based intervention delivered at homes of PLWD (Possin et al., 2019). Having coordinators visit PLWD homes and prioritize their needs and develop care plans, home-based care models have a common goal of improving quality of life, reducing transition from the home to long-term care facilities, and reducing health care utilization such as hospitalization. Three studies reported a reduction in hospitalizations among PLWD (Amjad et al., 2018; Daaleman et al., 2019; Samus et al., 2014).

One of the home-based care models is Maximizing Independence (MIND), a dementia care coordination program that utilizes a team of interdisciplinary, nonclinical community workers who serve as care coordinators for PLWD (Amjad et al., 2018; Samus et al., 2014). RNs and geriatric psychiatrists provide direct support and clinical guidance to care coordinators. In two studies, using the same cohort of 303 PLWD, researchers found that the number of hospitalizations among the intervention group was lower than the control group (67 vs. 37, respectively), but the results were not statistically significant (p = .849; Amjad et al., 2018; Samus et al., 2014).

The Reaching Out to Enhance the Health of Adults in Their Communities and Homes (REACH) is a care model which utilizes interdisciplinary teams to provide care to older adults with serious illness and concurrent comorbidities, including dementia (Daaleman et al., 2019). REACH physicians conduct an initial home visit using a clinical template that includes a comprehensive assessment and create an initial care plan with treatment recommendations. NPs provide most of the follow-up visits; nurse coordinators offer telephone support and care coordination. Furthermore, team members refer patients to a pharmacist and/or a social worker based on specific needs identified in the care plan. In one study, researchers evaluated the hospital use of 159 patients who had comorbidities, including dementia. They found that patients enrolled in the REACH program had a 43% reduction in hospital use after 12 months (Daaleman et al., 2019). The authors did not report if the findings were statistically significant.

Care Ecosystem is a telephone-based, collaborative care model delivered by trained team navigators who provide education, support, and care coordination to PLWD with a team of dementia specialists, including NPs, social workers, and pharmacists (Possin et al., 2019). Unlicensed care navigators are trained to provide care as the first point of contact for PLWD and their caregivers under nurse supervision. They also respond to caregivers’ immediate needs and screen for common problems providing personalized support and standardized education. Possin et al. (2019) found that the hospitalization rate among the 780 PLWD was not statistically reduced after 12 months (B = −0.03, 95% CI: −0.18–0.12, p = .71).

Lastly, in a coordinated care management program, dyads of PLWD and their caregivers are assigned a care manager in the intervention group (Duru et al., 2009). The care managers perform a home assessment, identify problems, initiate care plan actions, and send a summary to primary care providers. Trained care managers provide ongoing follow-up and in-home evaluations every 6 months. In a controlled clinical study, researchers reported no difference in hospitalizations between the intervention and usual care groups of 408 PLWD (13.5 vs. 15.9%, respectively, p = .74; Duru et al., 2009).

The Partnership Between Health Systems and Community-Based Resources

Four studies describe care models that focus on a partnership between health systems (i.e., Veteran Affairs, Kaiser Permanente, and University of California Los Angles [UCLA]) and community-based resources (i.e., Alzheimer’s Association chapters; Bass et al., 2003, 2015; Clark et al., 2004; Jennings et al., 2019). The goal of partnership between health systems and community-based resources is to provide the necessary support to improve patient outcomes such as reducing hospitalization among PLWD. To accomplish their goal, health systems coordinators address medical-related concerns (e.g., medications and disease management) for PLWD’s, and Alzheimer’s Association coordinators focus on caregivers’ nonmedical concerns (e.g., care-related strain and community service use). Out of the four studies, two showed that PLWD in intervention groups had fewer hospitalizations (Bass et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2004), and the rest did not show any improvements on hospitalizations.

The Cleveland Alzheimer’s Managed Care model was established to improve the quality of information and support services for PLWD and their family caregivers in the form of care consultation (Bass et al., 2003). Care consultation is a telephone-based intervention that aims to support patients and their families. In the intervention group, care consultants contact PLWD and their caregivers to conduct an initial assessment, identify challenges, and develop strategies for using personal, family, and community resources such as the local Alzheimer’s Association chapter (Clark et al., 2004). Two studies assessed the Cleveland Alzheimer’s Managed Care model’s influence on hospitalization rate between intervention and usual care cohorts (Bass et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2004). Bass et al. (2003) found no significant difference in the hospitalization rate between the intervention and usual care groups after a 12-month study period (b = −.02; p &gt; .10). However, Clark reported that PLWD in the intervention group with increased memory difficulties are less likely to have hospital admissions than the usual care group, which were not provided care consultation (b = −3.49; p &lt; .10; 2004).

Partners in Dementia Care (PDC) is another model based on partnerships between Veterans Affairs medical centers and Alzheimer’s Associate chapters. PDC includes an initial assessment, an action plan, and ongoing monitoring and reassessment (Bass et al., 2015). The researchers assessed how PDC influenced hospitalization among 328 veterans with dementia (Bass et al., 2015). With more advanced dementia symptoms, treatment-group veterans had fewer hospital admissions than usual care group veterans (−0.29; p = .01).

Lastly, the Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care (ADC) Program at UCLA is a comprehensive care program with NPs acting as care managers (Reuben et al., 2013). The program focuses on creating and implementing individualized care plans with input from primary care physicians. Physicians also monitor care plans regularly and refer PLWD and caregivers to a local Alzheimer’s Association chapter. PLWD and caregivers have access to this program’s resources 24 h per day, 7 days per week. In a case-control study, researchers assessed the influence of receiving care from the ADC Program at UCLA on hospitalizations among 3249 PLWD and found no difference between the intervention and control groups (Jennings et al., 2019).

Consultation Models

Four studies describe how providers (e.g., physicians, NPs, and RNs) deliver care through consultation models that are designed to work in conjunction with primary care. Two studies assessed how PLWD and their caregivers received care management primary care settings affiliated with health systems such as the Indianapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Callahan et al., 2006; Dorr et al., 2008). Two other studies describe care models, which focus on diminishing communication barriers between primary care providers and dementia specialists such as geriatricians and psychiatrists or geriatric and psychiatric NPs and their teams to reduce fragmented care (Clevenger et al., 2018; Noel et al., 2017). Memory care is an innovative physician-led care model where symptoms like a new onset cough, hypertension, and the psychological symptoms of dementia are managed (Clevenger et al., 2018), or disease management planning, medication review and reconciliation, caregiver education, and referrals to psychosocial services are provided (Noel et al., 2017). Two studies showed that the hospitalizations were reduced among PLWD in the intervention group (Clevenger et al., 2018; Noel et al., 2017). Below we describe each study in detail.

The Collaborative Care model consists of interdisciplinary teams that include NPs in the role of care manager (Callahan et al., 2006). NPs see the PLWD and their caregivers bimonthly initially and then continue seeing them monthly for 12 months. Caregivers complete the Memory and Behavior Problems Checklist on each visit to assess current symptoms and stressors. Based on the caregivers’ response, NPs make recommendations on managing patients’ behavioral symptoms. No significant difference were found in hospitalization rates between the intervention and usual care group among 153 PLWD at 12 months (18.8 vs. 22.6%, respectively; p = .69) or at 18 months (24.6 vs. 29.8%; p = .59; Callahan et al., 2006).

The Care Management Plus (CMP) model addresses chronically ill patients’ complex needs, including PLWD (Dorr et al., 2008). RNs manage patients’ needs by using a specialized information technology tool that includes structured protocols and guidelines for different conditions and diseases, a patient worksheet, and a care management tracking database. Dorr et al. (2008) found that hospitalizations for the intervention group were marginally lower, but not statistically significant (1 year: CMP 22.2 vs. control 23.3%, OR = 0.94, p = .55; 2 years: CMP 31.8 vs. control 34.7%, OR = 0.88, p = .23).

The Integrated Memory Care Clinic (IMCC) is a patient-centered medical home directed by NPs who care for PLWD (Clevenger et al., 2018). PLWD transfer their primary care to IMCC and no longer receive care from their previous providers. In this model, physicians do not directly care for PLWD but instead provide specialty consultation to NPs who serve as primary care providers who offer comprehensive and coordinated care to PLWD. The rate of ACSC hospitalizations, measured monthly, during the first 12 months of the IMCC implementation with 139 PLWD declined from 6.7 to 0.8% after 6 months (Clevenger et al., 2018).

MemoryCare, an independent, community-based, nonprofit organization, uses a medical and care management model for PLWD (Noel et al., 2017). PLWD and their caregivers receive care from MemoryCare providers, and communication is maintained throughout enrollment with patients’ primary care providers. MemoryCare providers work in conjunction with primary care providers to manage cognitive, psychiatric, and psychosocial aspects of dementia, and to provide referrals to supportive services for those enrolled in the program. While this model is physician-led, a nurse or social worker acts as the care manager. All patients are required to bring a caregiver who could assist them with implementing their care plans. The authors found significantly lower hospitalization rates for those in MemoryCare (204 per 1000) compared with a similar cohort of patients in a study by Phelan and colleagues (419 per 1000; Phelan et al., 2012).

Discussion

This review is timely given the rising rates of hospitalizations among PLWD. To our knowledge, this is the first review to give a comprehensive overview of dementia care models and their influence on the hospitalization rate among community-residing PLWD in ambulatory care settings in the United States. In this systematic review, we synthesized 13 studies that describe 11 unique care models. Seven studies reported that dementia care model utilization was associated with a low to a modest reduction in hospitalization among community-residing PLWD (Amjad et al., 2018; Bass et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2004; Clevenger et al., 2018; Daaleman et al., 2019; Noel et al., 2017; Samus et al., 2014). Care models under all categories appear to influence the reduction of hospitalizations among PLWD, indicating that dementia care models with integrated approaches to address PLWD in a more innovative setting are more successful than traditional primary care.

While seven studies reported promising findings, only two studies had statistically significant results showing a reduction in hospitalizations (Bass et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2004). Bass et al. (2015) and Clark et al. (2004) showed that those within the intervention groups (which had more people living with severe stages of dementia) were less likely to be admitted to the hospital than those within the usual care group (which had more people with mild to moderate stages of dementia). This finding shows that PLWD in the later stages of the disease benefited more from receiving care in settings that utilize dementia care models. Dementia has three stages: mild, moderate, and severe (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020). PLWD in moderate and severe stages have more complex medical needs compared to the ones in the mild stage and they face more difficulties communicating and performing routine tasks, including activities of daily living and managing their comorbidities (Alzheimer’s Association, 2020), which puts them at the higher risk for hospitalization. Thus, an essential shortcoming of the included studies is that many of them did not include information about the stage of dementia and its effect on hospitalization. Studies should assess the severity of dementia and should stratify the analyses by stage of dementia. Another potential reason for the lack of statistical significance in some of the studies could be related to small sample sizes. Future studies should ensure sample size sufficiency and provide a summary of their power analyses. As we focused on hospitalization as our main outcome, future systematic reviews should synthesize literature on all-cause and ACSC emergency department use among PLWD.

Additionally, ACSC hospitalizations were not evaluated in most of the studies. Community-residing PLWD have much higher rates of ACSC hospitalizations when compared to matched cognitively-able older adults (Phelan et al., 2012). Since ACSC hospitalizations can be prevented through proactive and timely care management in ambulatory care settings (Gao et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2011), they remain an important target for intervention. Lastly, research shows that higher continuity of care, or care from the same primary care provider over a year, can decrease potentially avoidable hospitalization among PLWD (Godard-Sebillotte et al., 2021). Thus, to develop a better understanding of how dementia care models can be optimized for community-residing PLWD, future studies should include analyses for both all-cause and ACSC hospitalizations while accounting for dementia severity and continuity of care in primary care.

Although several models described in this paper showed that care management, coordination and personalized care plans for PLWD achieved very promising results, they are not broadly adopted because these enhanced services are poorly reimbursed (Boustani et al., 2019). Boustani suggested an alternative payment model which would be a fixed amount of reimbursement per beneficiary per month, and would not be subject to co-pays or deductibles. Under this model, reimbursements are tied to reportable quality indicators, and both licensed (e.g., MD, NP, RN, and MSW) and non-licensed (e.g., care navigators) staff are reimbursed (2019). The alternative payment model would complement but not replace the existing fee-for-service structure for other conditions. The model suggested by Boustani and similar innovations in reimbursement are necessary for providing timely, accessible, equitable, evidence-based care to PLWD and their families. This payment infrastructure would incentivize providers and administrators to implement collaborative dementia care models which in turn could improve patient and care partner outcomes and reduce acute care encounters.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to provide an overview of existing ambulatory dementia care models and their impact on hospitalizations among community-residing PLWD in the United States. Our review differs from existing systematic reviews which address the impact of dementia care models on hospitalizations among PLWD by including all the United States and international care models (Godard-Sebillotte et al., 2019; Phelan et al., 2015). Also, our systematic review used the setting of care models to group them into various categories. Yet, similar to our systematic review, the authors found that not all dementia care models reduced hospitalization among PLWD (Godard-Sebillotte et al., 2019; Phelan et al., 2015).

Limitations

There are some limitations to this review. For instance, only studies in the United States were included, which limited our understanding of international dementia care models. Also, despite the rigorous search methodology, it is possible that eligible articles were missed. The studies also had varying sample sizes, diverse intervention duration, and various outcome measures, making it challenging to compare the findings across studies and reducing generalizability. Furthermore, hospitalization had various operational definitions throughout the included studies. Lastly, because not all included studies are RCTs, causation cannot be established between the care models and hospitalization.

Conclusion

Improving dementia health care delivery can reduce hospitalization rates and the associated negative health and economic outcomes (National Center for Health Statistics, 2020). As hospitalizations are associated with negative patient outcomes such as diminished quality of life, heightened functional decline, institutionalization, and mortality, it is vital to find ways to reduce hospitalizations. This review suggests that innovative dementia care models exist within ambulatory care settings which show promising hospitalization reduction among PLWD. Future research should explore how ambulatory dementia care models influence hospitalizations for people with different dementia stages and hospitalization types, with special focus on ACSC admissions. Stratifying the data by these factors will allow a greater understanding of how hospitalizations can be reduced among PLWD.
