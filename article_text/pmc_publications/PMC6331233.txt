Despite advances in the development of biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), accurate ante-mortem diagnosis remains challenging since a variety of neuropathologic disease states can coexist and contribute to the AD dementia syndrome. Here we report a neuroimaging study correlating hippocampal deformity with regional AD and TDP-43 pathology burden. We utilized hippocampal shape analysis of ante-mortem T1-weighted structural MRI images of 42 participants from two longitudinal cohort studies conducted by the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center. Surfaces were generated for the whole hippocampus and zones approximating underlying subfields using a previously developed automated image segmentation pipeline. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to correlate shape with pathology measures while accounting for covariates, with relationships mapped out onto hippocampal surface locations. A significant relationship existed between higher PHF-tau burden and inward hippocampal shape deformity in zones approximating CA1 and subiculum which persisted after accounting for coexisting pathologies. No significant patterns of inward surface deformity were associated with amyloid-beta or TDP-43 after including covariates. Our findings indicate that hippocampal shape deformity measures in surface zones approximating CA1 may represent a biomarker for postmortem AD pathology.

1. Introduction

As the population of the United States continues to age, dementia remains a significant contributor to both mortality and healthcare costs (Hurd et al. 2013, Tinetti et al. 2012). While Alzheimer disease (AD) related pathology is the most common, clinical-pathologic studies have shown that non-Alzheimer’s neurodegenerative pathologies such as vascular disease, alpha-synuclein, and transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43kDA (TDP-43) proteinopathy are much more common than was previously realized (Schneider et al. 2007a, Kovacs et al. 2013, Toledo et al. 2013) and that mixed pathologies dominate the pathologic landscape in older persons. In recent years, TDP-43 – an RNA/DNA binding protein found to be a major component of neuronal inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) cases – has been found to be associated with tauopathies such as AD pathology as well (Chang et al. 2016, Wilson et al. 2011). Given that so many different underlying disease processes can contribute to the AD dementia syndrome, the success of any future therapeutic treatments for neurodegenerative disorders will largely depend on the ability to achieve an early and accurate ante-mortem diagnosis.

Unfortunately, the ability to accurately identify each of the different types of neuropathologies that contribute to AD dementia remains an unmet challenge (Karageorgiou and Miller 2014, Rohrer and Rosen 2013). Furthermore, it is now commonly accepted that AD and related neurodegenerative conditions have a long prodromal period during which pathologic features are developing while persons remain asymptomatic (de Flores et al. 2015). Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in the discovery of molecularly specific biomarkers for AD, including cerebrospinal fluid markers for tau and amyloid-beta as well as imaging biomarkers using PET scanning (Scheltens et al. 2016, Frisoni et al. 2010). Advances in the development of radioactive ligands for amyloid-beta (Jansen et al. 2015, Ossenkoppele et al. 2015, Clark et al. 2012) and to some extent tau (Villemagne et al. 2015) bring the possibility of imaging specific disease processes in-vivo. However, no reliable imaging tracers for non-AD pathologies such as alpha-synuclein, hippocampal sclerosis, or TDP-43 have been found to date.

Multiple groups have employed structural MRI to classify different types of dementia based on patterns of atrophy, but few can confirm their results with pathological evidence (Vemuri et al. 2010, Kim et al. 2014, Li et al. 2016, Mak et al. 2016, Chow et al. 2012, Davatzikos 2008, Du 2007, Thaker 2017). This is problematic since a mixture of multiple neuropathologies can coexist in the brains of older adults (Schneider et al. 2007a). Several investigators have directly correlated spatial brain atrophy patterns measured from postmortem ex-vivo MRI with underlying neuropathologic disease burden obtained from autopsy data in the same subjects (Kotrotsou et al. 2015, Dawe et al. 2011). In Kotrotsou et al (2015), the authors performed ex-vivo MRI on a relatively large sample of subjects from two longitudinal cohort studies who underwent autopsy and found a significant correlation between AD pathology and regional brain volumes. Although post-mortem MRI techniques can enhance autopsy studies by providing fundamental insight into the connection between imaging and immunohistochemical findings, the challenge of finding useful in-vivo imaging markers of neuropathology remains. Investigators are beginning to address this problem by using antemortem in-vivo MRI to correlate spatial brain atrophy patterns with underlying neuropathologic disease burden (Raman et al. 2014, Kantarci et al. 2012).

In the present study, we explored the utility of high-dimensional analysis of in-vivo hippocampal shape based on structural MRI as biomarkers for underlying pathological disease states. Relative to other biomarkers, structural MRI is minimally invasive and an accepted component of the diagnostic workup for dementia (Knopman et al. 2001). We chose specifically to focus on the hippocampal, as this region is the earliest to show signs of atrophy in AD and is vulnerable to other pathological disease processes as well (de Flores et al. 2015), and shape information has been shown to be more sensitive to disease progression than volume when predicting dementia onset (Csernansky et al., 2005). Hippocampal subfield analysis has also been shown to have higher diagnostic value in preclinical stages of disease than whole hippocampal volumetry (Mueller et al. 2010). While our goal was to identify relationships between hippocampal shape patterns and specific neuropathology burdens, we also utilized our surface-based zones (Csernansky et al. 2005, Wang et al. 2003) to help interpret our patterns in relationship to underlying subfields. Our group had previously demonstrated that subjects with early stage AD-type dementia showed a distinct hippocampal shape deformity that involved the CA1 and subiculum subfields compared with non-demented controls (Csernansky et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2009). We now applied a similar method to correlate ante-mortem measures of hippocampal shape with relative amounts of AD- and TDP-43-related disease burden in the postmortem brain. Rather than limiting our study to individuals with clinically apparent AD diagnoses, we chose instead to focus on a community-based cohort of elderly adults with a mixed clinical profile (Bennett et al. 2012a, Bennett et al. 2012b). The rationale for this was two-fold. First, this avoided the need to make any a priori assumptions regarding pathology. Second, we hoped to capture the effect of neuropathology on hippocampal deformity at earlier, pre-clinical stages of disease. We hypothesized that each of the three abnormal protein aggregates we examined (i.e. phosphorylated tau, amyloid-beta, and TDP-43) would correlate with distinct spatial patterns of hippocampal atrophy.

2. Methods and materials

2.1. Study population

Participants from two longitudinal cohort studies at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center were included in this work. Specifically, subjects came from either the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Bennett et al. 2012a, Bennett et al. 2012b). Participants in the Religious Orders Study consisted of older Catholic nuns, priests, or brothers from across the United States, while participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project were older lay persons from across northeastern Illinois. The sole inclusion criteria was agreeing to sign an informed consent agreeing to annual clinical evaluation, biennial MRI and organ donation, and agreeing to sign an Anatomical Gift Act. Both studies were approved by the institutional review board at Rush University Medical Center. All participants underwent annual detailed clinical evaluations, and signed an informed consent and an anatomical gift act for brain donation upon death. Participants underwent a detailed evaluation that included medical history, neurologic examination and 21 cognitive performance tests, 19 of which were in common. Clinical diagnostic classification of dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were made in a multi-step process by a neuropsychologist and clinician as previously described (Bennett, 2002; Bennett 2006). Diagnoses of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia followed the recommendations of the NINDS/ADRDA criteria (Mckhann 1984) and were consistent the revised criteria (Mckhann et al. 2011). MCI referred to the presence of cognitive impairment in the absence of dementia and were consistent with the most recent criteria (Albert et al. 2011). The MMSE was use for descriptive purposes. Seventeen tests were used to summarize five cognitive domains including episodic memory, working memory, semantic memory, processing speed, and visuospatial ability as well as a global cognitive measure based on all 17 tests. Subjects who had undergone in-vivo structural MRI prior to death whose autopsy findings showed any sign of AD or TDP-43 pathology were included in this study.

2.2. Neuropathologic evaluation

Detailed procedures for postmortem brain tissue preparation and neuropathology analyses are described in previous publications (Arvanitakis et al., 2011, Bennett et al., 2004, Dawe et al., 2011, Kotrotsou et al. 2015, Schneider et al., 2004, Schneider et al., 2007a, Schneider et al., 2012). Here we provide a summary of the procedures and neuropathological measures used in this work.

At autopsy, brains of the deceased subjects were removed, divided into left and right hemispheres, and one hemisphere was immersion fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde solution. The fixed hemisphere was cut into 1 cm-thick coronal slabs for subsequent tissue dissection, pathological diagnosis and macroscopic and microscopic pathology procedures focused on the diagnosis and measurement of indices of AD and related disorders. Each case was reviewed by a board-certified neuropathologist who was blinded to age and clinical diagnoses, and assigned a modified NIA-Reagan score for presence and severity of AD neuropathologic changes based on consensus recommendations for postmortem diagnosis of AD, which relied on neurofibrillary tangles and plaques (Bennett et al. 2006, Consensus recommendations 1997). See Kotrotsou et al. (2015).

Amyloid-beta-immunoreactive plaques were assessed in eight brain regions: hippocampus CA1 and subiculum, entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus, calcarine cortex, midfrontal gyrus, and superior frontal gyrus. Sections were stained with a monoclonal antibody (1:50; amyloid-beta, Clone 6F/3D, Dako) with diaminobenzidine as the reporter, with 2.5% nickel sulfate to enhance contrast. Computer-assisted sampling and image analysis were used to quantify the average percent area occupied by amyloid-beta within each cortical region. A global composite measure of amyloid-beta burden was created by averaging the regional measures, and used in our statistical analyses as the primary neuropathological variable. See Bennett et al. (2004).

Tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles were assessed in the same eight regions examined for amyloid-beta. Sections were stained with an anti-paired helical filaments–tau (PHF-tau) antibody clone AT8 (ThermoScientific; 1:2000). Computer-assisted sampling was used to quantify the density of PHF-tau positive neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in each region (Wilson et al., 2013). A global composite measure of PHF-tau density was created by averaging the regional measures, and used in our statistical analyses as the primary neuropathological variable. See Bennett et al. (2004).

TDP-43 pathology was assessed in six brain regions: amygdala, hippocampus CA1, hippocampus dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, midfrontal cortex, and middle temporal cortex. Sections were stained with monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pS409/410; 1:100). Each region of interest was rated on a 6-point scale based on the number of inclusions in a 0.25-mm2 area of greatest density within that region (none, sparse [1-2 inclusions], sparse to moderate [3-5 inclusions], moderate [6-12 inclusions], moderate to severe [13-19 inclusions], and severe [20 or more inclusions]). A global composite measure of TDP-43 inclusions was created by summing the regional inclusions, and used in our statistical analyses as the primary neuropathological variable. See Wilson et al. (2013).

Hippocampal sclerosis (Schneider et al. 2009), Lewy bodies, gross infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy were measured and used as covariates in our study. Greater details of the assessments of these neuropathologies can be found in the publications cited herein. Lewy bodies were assessed in the substantia nigra, entorhinal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, midfrontal cortex, superior or middle temporal cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, using a monoclonal antibody to alpha-synuclein (Zymed LB 509; 1:50) (Buchman et al., 2017; Kapasi et al., 2017). Gross and microscopic infarcts were identified as previously described (Schneider et al. 2004, Arvanitakis et al.2011) and were scored as none, one, or more than one (Schneider et al. 2007b). Atherosclerosis was assessed based on the extent of vascular involvement at the circle of Willis, while arteriolosclerosis was determined by the severity of wall thickening and luminal occlusion of small arterioles in sections of the anterior basal ganglia (Arvanitakis et al., 2017; Kotrotsou et al. 2015). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was assessed on paraffin-embedded sections from the angular gyrus, midfrontal, temporal, and calcarine cortices, as previously described (Boyle et al., 2015; Kotrotsou et al. 2015). Atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and CAA were all rated on a 4 point scale from none to severe (Arvanitakis et al., 2017).

2.3. Image acquisition, segmentation, and processing: hippocampal surface + subfield zone generation

High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical data were obtained antemortem on a 1.5 Tesla GE (General Electric, Waukesha, WI) MRI scanner, using a 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with the following parameters: TE=2.8ms, TR=6.3ms, FOV=24cm × 24cm, flip angle = 8 degrees, 160 slices, 1mm slice thickness, 224×192 image matrix reconstructed to 256×256, 2 repetitions (Bennett et al. 2013, Stoub et al. 2005). Hippocampal segmentations were generated using a previously developed automated image processing pipeline, multi-atlas Freesurfer-Initiated Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (FS-LDDMM) (Khan et al. 2008, Wang et al. 2009, Christensen et al. 2015). For this analysis, a multi-atlas library consisting of 74 atlas scans with previously delineated expert manual segmentations of the hippocampus was used. In each of the 74 FS-LDDMM maps, Freesurfer (Fischl et al. 2002) was used for initial alignment of subject images to each atlas image, followed by large diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) (Beg et al. 2005) to generate hippocampal segmentations from each atlas based on high-dimensional transformations computed between the atlas and the subject. A final segmentation was generated for each subject by voxel averaging the segmentations, and a surface with corresponding vertices across all subjects were propagated from a previously developed template (Csernansky et al. 2004). Visual inspection is performed after mapping to ensure data quality.

2.4. Deformation and statistical analysis on surface

To quantify hippocampal surface shape deformity, whole hippocampal surfaces for all of the subjects were first rigidly aligned into a previously established template space, from which a population average was generated (Christensen et al. 2015, Csernansky et al. 2000). Perpendicular displacements were computed between corresponding vertices from this average to each subject. These displacements were then used as a measure of surface deformity for further analysis.

Statistical analysis on surfaces was performed using SurfStat in Matlab (Chung et al. 2010, Worsley et al. 2009) with modification for univariate and multivariate data. Multiple linear regression was used to investigate the association between in-vivo regional hippocampal surface deformation and postmortem neuropathologic markers of AD and TDP-43 pathology. Separate models were constructed to explore the association between surface deformity and regional amyloid-beta, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43 burden. Age at death, sex, and time between MRI and death were included as covariates. A secondary analysis was done to include additional terms for coexisting disease processes including the other primary pathological diagnoses (PHF-tau, amyloid-beta, TDP-43) as well as hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies, gross infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and CAA.

These analyses were first performed on the entire cohort (N=42), then repeated within the healthy controls (N=23) and combined clinical MCI+AD (N=19) separately. Finally, to examine robustness of the outcome, we performed the following experiments: In each experiment, we removed 4 subjects (approx. 10%) at random, computed the same surface relationships accounting for the same covariates as in the original analysis. We repeated this 10 times, with 4 different subjects removed each time.

A third multivariate analysis was performed excluding the 3 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD. Finally, a fourth analysis was done to examine the association between deformity and pathological diagnosis of AD using the NIA-Reagan Score.

In each analysis, a linear model was constructed for each vertex on the hippocampal surface map, with displacement (deformation) as the dependent variable and using neuropathology markers (TDP-43, amyloid-beta, and tau) and covariates as independent predictors (age at death, sex, time between MRI and death, and coexisting pathology including cerebrovascular disease, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis). To control for multiple comparisons, Random Field Theory (RFT) (Robert J. Adler and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 2010; R. J. Adler and Hasofer 1976; Worsley 2005) was applied (within SurfStat). Since signals (i.e., hippocampal deformations) at neighboring vertices are necessarily correlated therefore may be spatially continuous (i.e., forming clusters), multiple comparison correction methods such as Bonferroni or false discovery rate (FDR) (Genovese et al. 2002) are not appropriate, as they only consider the peak of significance at individual vertices (Perneger 1998). RFT, however, considers both peaks and spatial extent of the signal by modeling the noise as Gaussian random fields (Chumbley and Friston 2009). This approach produced significant clusters of vertices at a desired family-wise error rate (FWER) (e.g., p&lt;0.05). Significant beta coefficients were visualized as color-maps superimposed on the population average hippocampal surface. To aid the visual interpretation of the patterns of relationships, template-based surface zones approximating the underlying CA1, subiculum, and combined CA2-4 and dentate gyrus hippocampal subfields, as previously described (Christensen et al. 2015, Csernansky et al. 2005, Wang et al. 2003), were utilized.

3. Results

3.1. Ante-mortem Population Characteristics

Demographic information including age at the time of MRI scan, age at death, sex, number of years of education is provided in Table 1. Total average left hippocampal volume (SD) was 2787 (438) mm3 and right 2877 (487) mm3. Overall, subjects had a spectrum of ante-mortem clinical diagnoses. Of the 42 subjects, 23 were determined to be cognitively normal (CN), 16 had a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and three had probable-AD. The three subjects with AD were impaired in memory by definition. Of the 16 subjects with MCI, nine were classified as amnestic (56%).

3.2. Distribution of Neuropathologies across Subjects

The presence of various neuropathologic markers upon autopsy is summarized in Table 2. Amyloid-beta was fairly evenly distributed across brain regions, while PHF-tau was more localized to the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and mesial temporal cortex. For TDP-43, the area most affected in subjects was the amygdala (42.5%), followed by hippocampal CA1 (31%), and dentate gyrus (14%). Of the 42 subjects, 25 received a post-mortem pathologic diagnosis of AD using modified NIA-Reagan scores (i.e., intermediate or high scale) (Bennett et al., 2006). The majority (88%) also had at least one non-AD neuropathology, including TDP-43 pathology (n=17: 6 localized to amygdala; 10 extension to hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex; 1 extension to the neocortex), Lewy body diseases (9: 1 nigral predominant; 6 limbic type; 2 neocortical type), hippocampal sclerosis (3), and cerebral Infarctions (7 gross only; 8 micro-chronic only; 8 both). Coexisting cerebrovascular pathologies were also common, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA, n=32: 23 mild; 8 moderate; 1 severe), cerebral atherosclerosis (32: 23 mild; 8 moderate; 1 severe), arteriolosclerosis (27: 17 mild; 9 moderate; 1 severe).

3.3. Relationship between Neuropathologic Burden and Hippocampal Surface Deformity

Figure 1 shows hippocampal surface maps representing the relationship between global PHF-tau, amyloid-beta, and TDP-43 levels and hippocampal surface deformity for all 42 subjects before and after accounting for coexisting pathology. Without accounting for coexisting pathology, higher global PHF-tau burden was associated with more inward deformity in surface zones approximating the CA1 and the subiculum, higher global amyloid-beta burden was associated with inward deformity in the surface zone approximating subiculum, and higher global TDP-43 levels were associated with inward deformity in the surface zone approximating CA1. Associations with each pathology demonstrate a distinct spatial pattern. After accounting for coexisting pathology, the relationship observed between higher PHF-tau burden and increased inward deformity in hippocampal surface zones approximating CA1 and subiculum remained. However, when covariates were included, the relationships previously observed for amyloid-beta and TDP-43 were no longer significant. In the experiments examining robustness of the outcome, nine out of the 10 experiments showed similar spatial patterns (not shown) as the original analysis.

Figure 2 left column shows hippocampal surface maps representing the relationship between global PHF-tau, amyloid-beta, and TDP-43 levels and hippocampal surface deformity in the 19 MCI + AD subjects before and after accounting for coexisting pathology. The patterns of association are similar to those obtained in the entire cohort. Without accounting for coexisting pathology, higher global PHF-tau burden were associated with more inward deformity in surface zones approximating the CA1 and subiculum, higher global amyloid-beta burden was associated with more inward deformity in the surface zone approximating the CA1, and higher global TDP-43 levels were associated with more inward deformity in surface zones approximating the CA1 and subiculum. We note that the associations demonstrate a distinct spatial pattern for each pathology. After accounting for coexisting pathology, all relationships were no longer significant (not shown).

Figure 2 right column shows hippocampal surface maps representing the relationship between global PHF-tau, amyloid-beta, and TDP-43 levels and hippocampal surface deformity in the 23 healthy control subjects before and after accounting for coexisting pathology. Without accounting for coexisting pathology, global amyloid-beta burden was not associated with hippocampal deformity, and higher PHF-tau and TDP-43 levels were associated with more inward deformity in the surface zone approximating the subiculum. However these associations appear to have only a minimum surface distribution. Higher global amyloid-beta burden was associated with inward deformity in the surface zone approximating the subiculum. After accounting for coexisting pathology, the relationship observed between higher TDP-43 levels and more inward deformity in the surface zone approximating the subiculum remained, and the relationship previously observed for PHF-tau was no longer significant (not shown).

4. Discussion

In this study of a community-based cohort of elderly adults, we explored whether three different underlying neuropathologic processes – PHF-tau, amyloid-beta, and TDP-43 – were associated with unique patterns of hippocampal deformation. When separately examined for the combined MCI + AD subjects vs. HC subjects, the associations were observed largely within the MCI + AD subjects. While several groups have previously explored the utility of hippocampal shape analysis in diagnosis of various dementia subtypes (Mak 2016 et al., Christensen et al. 2015, Khan et al. 2015, Chow et al. 2012), and one has examined the relationship between postmortem hippocampal atrophy and underlying neuropathologies (Dawe et al. 2011), our study is – to our knowledge - the first to examine association of different neuropathologies with ante-mortem hippocampal shape deformity using neuropathologically-confirmed cases.

In our study, higher levels of global PHF-tau burden were associated with increased shape deformation in surface zones approximating the CA1 and the subiculum regions of the hippocampus. This is consistent with prior imaging studies that have demonstrated early involvement of the hippocampal regions approximating the CA1 subfield in AD and MCI (La Joie et al. 2013, Tepest et al. 2008, Li et al. 2007, Scher et al. 2007, Wang et al. 2006 &amp; 2003). While all of these studies relied on clinical rather than pathological classification of subjects, the fact that this relationship seems to hold when actual neuropathologic markers are taken into account yields credibility to the use of hippocampal subfield analysis as a biomarker for AD-specific neuropathology. That PHF-tau burden specifically correlated with selective atrophy in the surface zone approximating the CA1 region of the hippocampus further supports previous neuropathologic findings that show CA1 is one of the earliest regions affected by neurofibrillary tangle deposition (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Schonheit et al. 2004, Fukutani et al. 2000). Furthermore, it has been shown that atrophy on MRI correlates with tau immunostaining burden (Whitwell et al. 2008). One must be cautious when making clinical inferences based solely on the presence of tau pathology and hippocampal atrophy, as these findings can also be present in a significant proportion of the “cognitively normal” elderly population (Lace et al. 2009, Arriagada et al. 1992b, Price et al.1991). Nevertheless, in one recent structural MRI study, investigators noted a relationship between subjective cognitive decline – a self-reported perception of memory problems that is not picked up on during routine neuropsychologic testing – and selective atrophy of the hippocampal CA1 region (Perrotin et al. 2015). If hippocampal atrophy can indeed be identified on structural MRI in preclinical stages of disease years before the development of MCI, further exploration of this biomarker as a clinical screening tool may be warranted.

In regards to amyloid-beta, the relationship between neuropathologic disease burden and hippocampal subfield deformity was less clear. While increased inward deformity of the surface zone approximating the subiculum was related to increased amounts of global amyloid-beta burden, this relationship did not hold when covariates were accounted for. A recent study by Hsu et al combining the use of structural MRI and amyloid PET scanning found that the amyloid-beta positive group had a significantly smaller hippocampal tail, presubiculum, subiculum, and total hippocampal gray matter volume compared to the amyloid-beta negative group, while the groups did not differ in size of CA1, CA2/3, or CA4/dentate gyrus (Hsu et al. 2015). While several other amyloid-PET imaging studies have shown relationships between amyloid-beta burden and various imaging markers of neurodegeneration (Chetelat et al. 2012, Becker et al. 2011, Dickerson et al. 2009, Storandt et al. 2009), none of these models included terms to account for coexisting pathology. Therefore, while studies that do not account for coexisting pathologies show that amyloid-beta influences neurodegeneration in the temporal region, our results suggest that it does so by mediating other neuropathologic pathways. This could explain studies that show amyloid-beta burden itself does not correlate well with brain atrophy (Josephs et al. 2008), and falls in line with neuropathologic studies which have shown that tau pathology has a stronger temporal and spatial correlation with neuronal loss than plaques (Musiek and Holtzman 2015, Gomez-Isla et al. 1997, Arriagada et al.1992a), and that tau actually mediates the association of amyloid-beta with cognition (Bennett et al. 2004, Bennett et al. 2005, Yu et al. 2014). Several investigators have hypothesized that amyloid-beta may trigger a worsening of tau-related neurodegeneration (Wang et al. 2016, Musiek et al. 2015), while animal studies suggest that tau mediates the toxicity of amyloid-beta (Ittner et al. 2010). Further molecular studies would be needed to test these hypotheses.

For TDP-43, we observed a relationship between TDP-43 deposition and increased inward shape deformity in the surface zone approximating CA1, with a spatial distribution that was different from that of PHF-tau. However, this pattern did not hold when we accounted for coexisting pathologies. Further studies would be needed to confirm our preliminary evidence between TDP-43 deposition and unique patterns of neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, some studies have found an association between the presence of TDP-43 and hippocampal atrophy in subjects with coexisting AD pathology (Josephs et al. 2014a + 2014b, Josephs et al. 2015). This falls in line with neuropathologic studies that have indicated that the medial temporal lobe structures (including the hippocampus) are susceptible to TDP-43 inclusions in AD (James et al. 2016, Josephs et al. 2016, Josephs et al. 2014a + 2014b, Hu et al. 2008). Although their exact staging schemes differ, those studies strongly suggest that TDP-43 deposition in AD begins in the amygdala, spreads to the entorhinal cortex/hippocampus, and eventually includes other areas of the cortex (James et al. 2016, Josephs et al. 2016). Future structural MRI studies should include the amygdala to capture additional variation in patterns of AD- and TDP-related effects on neurodegeneration.

As mentioned above, hippocampal shape deformation showed unique patterns of association with PHF-tau, amyloid-beta, and TDP-43 within the MCI + AD subjects when not accounting for coexisting pathology. These patterns were similar to those obtained in the entire cohort, especially for PHF-tau. When visually compared with the healthy controls, the spatial distribution patterns were distinct and extended across much larger portions of the surfaces. These results suggest that the unique spatial patterns between hippocampal shape and AD and related pathologies can be potential biomarkers that could distinguish underlying disease pathologies in patients with a clinical diagnosis. Larger number of cases should be included in the future to confirm and validate these preliminary findings. Future studies can then develop approaches in which this type of information is used to select appropriate patients for clinical trials of specific disease-altering interventions. The findings on the healthy controls is intriguing, suggesting a preclinical disease process. While studies have shown that some cognitively normal individuals carry AD and related pathologies, larger studies are needed to further validate our findings.

In a previously published study (Zarow et al. 2011), we used similar methods to compare hippocampal surface shape deformation between individuals with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and AD. In that paper, we argued that clinical diagnosis of HS is rarely if ever, made, and in fact all HS cases from that study received a clinical diagnosis other than HS. In the current study, the amyloid-beta, PHF tau and TDP 43 pathologies were found in the three subjects with HS. Also, our analysis covariated for HS ratings, which were present (severe) or absent (possible or nonexistent). Therefore, our results demonstrate that antemortem MRI measures can relate to postmortem AD and related disorders (age related TDP 43 pathology) pathologies despite the presence of HS, which is well aligned with our overall hypothesis. Nonetheless more data with HS will be needed to determine whether HS with or without coexisting AD and TDP 43 pathologies also has specific shape changes.

Overall, our study had several important strengths. First, we relied on neuropathologically-confirmed cases, avoiding the need for making a priori assumptions regarding neuropathologic classification. This is essential because studies have shown that presently correlation between clinical symptoms and neuropathology subtypes could be poor (Mesulam et al. 2014). Second, the fact that the subjects were drawn from two community cohorts of older individuals who were enrolled as healthy participants (some of whom later converted to MCI/AD while others did not) may make the results more applicable to the general elderly population than they would be had subjects been drawn from memory clinics alone. Third, our method utilized structural MRI, which may be a more economical alternative to other imaging techniques such as amyloid- or tau-PET, as Medicare does not routinely reimburse these novel diagnostic studies in the work-up for mild cognitive impairment (Jacques et al. 2013). Finally, this work raises the possibility of prediction of multiple underlying neuropathologies using a single imaging study, which could be an advantage over PET methods which rely on multiple radioactive ligands.

However, our study also had some important limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small (N = 42), limiting our ability to detect subtle differences with enough power. For this reason, it would be essential to replicate these findings in larger study populations. Second, our ability to directly correlate neuroimaging with post-mortem neuropathologic data was limited by the fact that pathology was examined in sparse and relatively small areas of the brain, each covering 6-20 microns, whereas whole-brain/structure coverage would have been necessary to establish a true ante-mortem/post-mortem connection. Third, our study did not include results of clinical testing in the analysis. Consequently, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the clinical significance of hippocampal volume loss in respect to cognition. Additionally, hippocampal surface shape represented in this paper do not necessarily reflect atrophy specific to certain underlying subfields. For example, atrophy of the dentate gyrus may contribute to the surface shape deformation in the CA and subiculum areas as much of the dentate gyrus is not appreciated at the surface of the hippocampus. Finally, our study population had a mean age of about 88 years at the time of imaging, which is much older than the typical age of patients presenting to memory clinics. Therefore, the relationships we observed may be different in those populations. Further studies should be done to validate our findings in larger study populations and to further characterize the relationship between TDP-43 burden and hippocampal shape.

Since our interpretation of the relationship between hippocampal shape and neuropathology burden was related to underlying subfields, variations on the anatomical definition of the subfields may influence the interpretation. As summarized in (Yushkevich et al., 2015), while there is good overlap among the 21 active hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols, differences exist as well. For example, while some protocols delineate each of the CA1-4, others combine them in different ways. Further, the boundary between the CA fields and their adjacent dentate gyrus and subiculum varies depending on the atlases used. Similar issues exist among automatic subfield methods (Mueller et al., 2018). Therefore, when localizing our observed relationships between hippocampal shape and neuropathology burdens to underlying subfields, caution should be exercised.

There is a complex set of correspondences between dementia-related syndromes and neuropathologies, which makes accurate antemortem diagnosis difficult. Recent studies have shown that patients often carry a mixture of neuropathologies. For example, significant numbers of clinical AD cases demonstrate admixtures of amyloid-beta and TDP-43 neuropathologies. Two decades of clinical trials of AD patients have failed to produce effective disease-modifying drugs, and inaccurate antemortem diagnosis has been implicated as a key contributing factor. The current study continues the work that addresses the unmet need for antemortem biomarkers that can identify patients with specific neuropathologies, so that future disease-altering drugs can be tested with more success. Larger numbers will be needed to further investigate the unique relationships between hippocampal deformation and specific pathologies. Amyloid, like PHF-tau are measured with high precision and there is work underway to more accurately define the quantity of TDP-43 pathology in each region. The success of disease-altering therapies depends largely on an early and specific diagnosis. Research presented in this paper could lead to tools that can be used in future clinical trials to identify the most appropriate patient populations for specific disease-altering interventions. The ability to create biomarkers based on structural MRI could be a powerful tool in differentiating between AD and non-AD pathologies at preclinical stages of disease. If and when effective disease-altering therapies are developed, our disease predicting biomarkers can be used to select the most appropriate therapies for the patient.
