Introduction:

An active lifestyle with regular exercise is thought to decrease or delay the onset of Alzheimer dementia through increasing blood flow to the brain. We examined the mean flow velocity (MFV) and pulsatility index (PI) in the middle cerebral arteries of individuals randomized into two groups-a Usual Physical Activity (UPA) group and an Enhanced Physical Activity (EPA) exercise intervention group-to determine if exercise training is related to changes in cerebral blood flow.

Methods:

We examined 23 participants, randomized into a UPA group (n=12) and an EPA group (n=11), with transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak, mL/kg/min) testing at baseline and following a 26-week intervention. TCCD was used to measure MFV and PI. Participants in the EPA group completed supervised aerobic exercise training for 26 weeks. Kendall’s tau b correlation was used to examine relationships between variables. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to examine changes between the UPA and EPA groups.

Results:

There was no significant change in MFV or PI in the UPA group or the EPA group (p-values &gt;0.05) between baseline and 26 weeks; the change between the UPA and EPA groups was also not significant (p=0.603). There was no evidence of an association between change in VO2peak and change in MFV or PI (all p-values &gt;0.05). Participants in the EPA group significantly increased their VO2peak compared to the UPA group (p=0.027).

Conclusion:

This study did not demonstrate evidence of a significant change in the MFV in the middle cerebral arteries or evidence of a significant change in the PI between UPA and EPA groups. Future studies should be performed in larger cohorts and should consider use of personalized exercise programs to maximize understanding of how cerebrovascular hemodynamics change in structure and function with exercise for adults at risk for Alzheimer dementia.

pmcIntroduction:

Transcranial color-coded Doppler (TCCD) hemodynamic measures of mean flow velocity (MFV, cm/s) and pulsatility index (PI, unitless) have been used to monitor changes in cerebral hemodynamics associated with changes in exercise habits.1, 2 Transcranial Doppler studies have shown that individuals with Alzheimer dementia (AD) have lower MFV and increased PI when compared to healthy, age-matched controls.3–5 The hypothesis is that MFV in the middle cerebral arteries is a surrogate for brain perfusion and PI is a surrogate for downstream vascular resistance. The defining characteristics of AD are the presence of extracellular deposits of misfolded proteins called amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques6 and intracellular hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein that result in neuronal dysfunction.7 It is unknown if changes in cerebral hemodynamics are the result of amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles, or if changes in hemodynamics resulting in decreased perfusion contribute to brain changes associated with AD.5,8 If the latter is true, then engaging in healthy behaviors that increase cerebral blood flow and decrease vascular resistance, such as increasing physical activity (PA) may delay the onset of brain changes associated with AD. Increasing PA has been shown to increase MFV and decrease the PI in the middle cerebral arteries in sedentary adults,1,2 thus indicating that exercise may increase cerebral perfusion and decrease cerebral vascular resistance.1 In this study, we examined the hemodynamic measures of middle cerebral artery MFV and PI in middle-aged sedentary adults randomized to two groups: 1. Usual PA (UPA, control) and 2. Enhanced PA (EPA, exercise intervention). Each group had TCCD performed to examine MFV and PI at baseline and following a 26-week intervention. Our hypothesis is that individuals will increase their MFV, a surrogate for brain perfusion, and decrease their cerebral PI, a surrogate for downstream vascular resistance, as they increase their PA and improve their cardiorespiratory fitness.

Methods

Participants

Participants were individuals enrolled in the aeRobic Exercise And Cognitive Health (REACH) pilot study and were recruited from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) or the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (WADRC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (n=25). 9 All participants were; cognitively healthy individuals between 45 and 80 years of age, physically inactive (&lt; 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity PA)9,10, approved by their physician to participate in an aerobic exercise training program, and had a family history of at least one parent with AD. 9

The study design was a 1:1 block-randomized parallel two-arm trial.9 Participants were randomized to one of the two study groups previously described: UPA and EPA. The UPA group received educational materials about exercise but were not given instructions to alter their typical PA behavior. The EPA group participated in a 26-week aerobic exercise training intervention consisting of supervised treadmill walking sessions three times per week. Sessions progressively increased to 50 minutes per session and 70-80% heart rate reserve by week 7, with the goal of meeting or exceeding the current public health recommendation for a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity aerobic exercise. 9 The protocol was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board and all individuals provided informed written consent for participation in the study.

Transcranial Color Coded Doppler Imaging

The methods for performing the transcranial color and pulsed wave Doppler examination have been previously published. 9 Briefly, all participants underwent transcranial color and pulsed wave Doppler imaging of the right and left middle cerebral arteries using the transtemporal acoustic window and the Acuson S2000 ultrasound system and 4-1Vc transducer (Siemens Ultrasound, Malvern, PA, USA). The pulsed wave Doppler sample volume was set at a depth between 45 to 60 mm where the highest peak systolic velocity was noted. The peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, resistive index, PI, and systolic to diastolic ratio were obtained from the Doppler waveforms on both the right and left sides (Figure 1). The MFV and PI were calculated as described by Barlinn et al. 2015 11 and are presented below in equations 1 and 2. 11 A temporal average peak velocity of &gt; 120 cm/s was used as a threshold for vasospasm. 12,13 The Barlinn et al.11 equations were used because autotrace Doppler tracking did not track well on all cardiac cycles across all participants and manual trace was also difficult on some signals that were noisy. The peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity were easily measured for all participants, and thus the Barlinn et al.11 equations were used to calculate MFV and PI.

Equation 1 MFV11=End diastolic velocity+(Peak systolic velocity−End diastolic velocity/3)

Equation 2 PI11=(Peak systolic velocity−End diastolic velocity)/MFV

For each participant the right and left middle cerebral artery MFV and PI were averaged to provide an average MFV and PI for each participant. One participant did not have a window on the left side and only the right side values were used.

Cardiorespiratory Fitness Assessment

The methods for performing cardiorespiratory fitness assessment have previously been described. 9 Briefly, a modified Balke continuous graded maximal treadmill protocol was used to assess the cardiorespiratory fitness for all participants at baseline and following the 26-week intervention.9 Participants completed the treadmill testing after a 12 hour fast from nicotine, food, caffeine, alcohol and medications. Participants were monitored with electrocardiography throughout the treadmill test. Oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production, and minute ventilation were monitored using a metabolic cart and 2-way non-rebreathing valve (TrueOne 2400, ParvoMedics, Sandy, UT).9 At a constant self-selected walking speed, the initial treadmill incline was 0% and was increased by 2.5% every 2 minutes until the participant reached volitional exhaustion. Criteria for peak aerobic capacity were met if participants achieved at least two of the following: 1) respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.1, 2) achieving 90% of maximum age-predicted heart rate, 3) rating of perceived exertion of ≥17 and 4) change in VO2 &lt; 200mL with increasing incline. 9

Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables are reported as median (interquartile range [IQR]), categorical variables are presented as number (n) and percent (%). Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to examine changes within each group. Kendall’s tau b correlation was used to examine relationships between variables. Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to examine changes between the UPA and Enhanced EPA groups. Change variables were calculated as post-intervention minus baseline.

Results

Participants

Twenty-five individuals were recruited for participation in this study. Two did not complete the study, thus the results of 23 participants were analyzed. The 23 participants were median age 64.95 (IQR 7.77) years, and 12 were female (52.2% ). The median body-mass index (BMI) was 28.70 (IQR 6.30), median systolic blood pressure was 120.00 (IQR 31.50) mmHg, and median diastolic blood pressure 76.50 (IQR 14.00) mmHg. The median average MFV in the middle cerebral arteries was 44.93 (8.90) cm/s and the median average PI in the middle cerebral arteries was 0.94 (0.15) unitless. There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the UPA and EPA groups (all p-values &gt;0.05, Table 1).

Baseline correlations

There were no statistically significant baseline correlations between transcranial Doppler measures of MFV and PI with age, BMI (kg/m2), VO2peak, systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure (all p-values &gt;0.05) (Table 2).

Change in VO2peak (cardiorespiratory fitness)

Results for cardiorespiratory fitness have been previously reported in association with brain glucose metabolism, cognition and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). 14 Briefly, for this study, 23 participants continued in the study with 12 randomized to UPA and 11 randomized to EPA. At baseline, there was no significant difference in cardiorespiratory fitness measures by VO2peak (mL/kg/min) between the groups (UPA group 27.17 [IQR 9.36], EPA group 22.73 [4.33], p=0.176). The median (IQR) change in VO2peak between the two groups at 26 weeks was significantly different (UPA group median change 1.24 (3.5) mL/kg/min and EPA group median change 3.94 (3.26) mL/kg/min, z=2.2, p=0.027) (Table 3).

Transcranial Doppler changes between Usual PA and Enhanced PA groups

Of the 23 participants, three did not have an acoustic window, thus 20 participants (n=11 UPA, n=9 EPA) were analyzed for transcranial Doppler measures of MFV and PI. The median (IQR) MFV change in the UPA group at baseline was 0.30 (11.57) cm/s. The median (IQR) MFV change from baseline to post-intervention for the EPA group was −0.83 (10.79) cm/s; the change between groups was not significant (p=0.603). The median (IQR) PI change from baseline to 26 weeks for the UPA group was 0.04 (0.15) and was 0.04 (0.15) for the EPA group (p=0.603, Table 3).

Transcranial Doppler within subject changes baseline to 26-weeks

The median (IQR) MFV in the UPA group at baseline was 45.05 (4.92) cm/s and 49.47 (14.62) cm/s at post-intervention (p=0.365). The median PI at baseline for the UPA group was 0.88 (0.19) and 0.93 (0.10) at post-intervention (p=0.054). The median MFV for the EPA group at baseline was 41.13 (14.32) cm/s and 45.85 (17.01) cm/s at post-intervention (p=0.570) (Figure 2). The median average PI at baseline was 0.95 (0.15) and post-intervention was 1.08 (0.14) (p=0.301) (Table 4).

Correlations between change in VO2peak (mL/kg/min) and transcranial Doppler MFV and PI

Change in VO2peak (mL/kg/min) from baseline to post-intervention was significant for the EPA group (p&lt;0.001), however, this change did not correlate with change in MFV and PI for either group (Kendall’s tau b correlation coefficient MFV = all p-values &gt;0.05). Change in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and BMI also did not correlate with changes in MFV, and PI measured with transcranial Doppler (all p-values &gt; 0.05) (Table 5 a and b).

Discussion

In this small pilot study, we did not demonstrate an increase in MFV or a decrease in PI following the EPA exercise intervention in a group of middle-aged sedentary adults with an enriched family history for AD. Yet, we did demonstrate a significant change in cardiorespiratory fitness from baseline to post-intervention in the EPA group.14 This differs from what others have shown in which increasing PA was associated with improved arterial function, increased MFV and decreased PI.1, 2, 15 –17 We postulate that this may be due to differences in length and intensity of the exercise interventions, and age of study participants.2 Previous studies1,18 have suggested that there are two potential mechanisms as to how aerobic exercise increases flow to the brain. The two mechanisms proposed are 1) structural changes and 2) functional changes. Structural changes are thought to occur with exercise due to angiogenesis and the increase in small diameter vessels in the region of the middle cerebral artery.1, 2, 18,19 As these vessels increase in number and size, the MFV increases. In addition, animal studies have demonstrated increased angiogenesis and cerebral blood flow associated with an increase in exercise.1,2,18 Functional changes in the artery associated with aerobic exercise include improvement of endothelial dysfunction. With aerobic exercise, endothelial nitric oxide synthase is increased improving endothelial function.1, 2, 20 Thus, it is hypothesized that aerobic exercise may contribute to improved cerebral artery structure and function which leads to increased cerebral blood flow.

One reason we may not have seen change in MFV and PI in this study is that exercise responsiveness may depend on an interplay between individual phenotype (e.g., baseline cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiovascular disease, or AD risk factor status) and exercise intervention characteristics (e.g., exercise intensity, session duration). In this study, the same exercise program was applied to all participants because it was a pilot and because this was the first aerobic exercise intervention conducted in this population. Other studies have shown heterogeneous responses in vascular health (using brachial artery flow mediated dilation FMD) and exercise. 21–25 Factors that appear to play a role in this heterogeneity are; exercise training frequency and duration, baseline arterial health and cardiorespiratory fitness, risk factors (such as blood pressure, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and genetic profile.21,26,27,28. One study demonstrated that the greatest change in %FMD was associated with longer exercise training duration, lower session frequency, and lower FMD and body weight at baseline.21 With regard to FMD, this suggests that those with poorer endothelial health at baseline have the highest ceiling for improvement and that training characteristics matter more.21 Individuals who initiate exercise in a relatively healthy state and with higher cardiorespiratory fitness may have less opportunity to demonstrate change in vascular structure and function when undergoing the same exercise program as individuals in poorer health. Thus, exercise programs may need to be personalized based on baseline health characteristics.21 For example, it is possible that high intensity interval training could prompt vascular adaptation among healthy individuals who otherwise might not adapt to continuous moderate intensity training.22 In addition, other FMD studies have demonstrated that in some individuals the arterial diameter enlarged with exercise training but the FMD% change decreased due to a larger artery. Thus, exercise may allow for different forms of arterial adaptation—each beneficial—that were not captured with the sole hemodynamic measures of MFV and PI in this study.21,24–26,29

Limitations

This study has several limitations to include a small sample size and we used TCCD MFV and PI as a surrogate for cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance. With this technique we are not able to measure the diameter of the artery, and therefore if the diameter is changing (increasing or decreasing) we may see changes in velocity due to changes in the diameter of the artery. Although we did not see any evidence of significant change in either the PI or the MFV between the two study groups, we cannot account for any potential diameter changes in the middle cerebral arteries. All individuals in the EPA group participated in the same exercise program. In the future, it may be beneficial to personalize the exercise routine for individuals based on other risk factors for cardiovascular disease and AD.

Conclusion

In this small pilot study we did not find evidence of a significant change in the MFV or PI in the middle cerebral arteries following the exercise intervention in a group of middle-aged sedentary adults with a family history of AD. Future studies should be performed in larger cohorts, should evaluate whether response varies by baseline health characteristics, and should test exercise programs personalized to individual risk profiles to maximize understanding of how cerebrovascular hemodynamics change in structure and function with exercise. This understanding is needed to better prescribe exercise routines to individuals to decrease the risk for or delay the onset of AD.21 In summary, MFV and PI as measures of cerebrovascular health may not fully capture the benefits of exercise in individuals at risk for AD over a 26-week time period. Future studies with personalized exercise prescriptions are needed and monitoring for a longer follow-up period to fully understand how exercise changes structure and function of arteries.
