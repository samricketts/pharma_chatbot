Background:

Clinical trials in SCA3 will require biomarkers for use as outcome measures.

Methods:

To evaluate total tau (t-tau), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), and neurofilament light-chain (NfL) as fluid biomarkers in SCA3, ATXN3 mutation carriers (n=143) and controls (n=172) were clinically assessed, and plasma concentrations of the four proteins were analysed on the Simoa HD-1 platform. Eleven ATXN3 mutation carrier CSF samples were analysed for t-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181). A transgenic SCA3 mouse model (MJDTg) was used to measure cerebellar t-tau levels.

Results:

Plasma t-tau levels were higher in mutation carriers below the age of 50, compared to controls, and the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs was associated with t-tau in ataxic patients (p=0.004). Preataxic carriers showed higher CSF t-tau and p-tau181 concentrations compared to ataxic patients (p=0.025 and p=0.014, respectively). Cerebellar t-tau was elevated in MJDTg mice compared to wild-type (p=0.033), only in early stages of the disease. GFAP and UCHL1 did not show higher levels in mutation carriers compared to controls. Plasma NfL concentrations were higher in mutation carriers compared to controls, and differences were greater for younger carriers. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia was the strongest predictor of NfL in ataxic patients (p&lt;0.001).

Conclusion:

Our results suggest that tau might be a marker of early disease stages in SCA3. NfL can discriminate mutation carriers from controls and is associated to different clinical variables. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm their potential role as biomarkers in clinical trials.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is the most common autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia worldwide and is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, which encodes ataxin-31,2. Currently, there is no curative treatment for this condition and trials for compounds targeting the mutant ATXN3 allele will require disease markers for use as outcome measures3–5. Tau, neurofilament light-chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) could address this unmet need for biofluid markers, as they can mirror neuronal injury or underlying pathological processes in the central nervous system6.

The microtubule-associated protein tau (encoded by the MAPT gene) has been studied as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)7–9, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)10–14, and Huntington’s disease (HD)15, as well as a prognostic biomarker in stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI)16,17. In a pilot study, CSF tau was elevated in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and multiple system atrophy-cerebellar type (MSA-c) compared to controls18. In SCA3, dysregulation of MAPT splicing with a decreased 4R/3R ratio has been observed19.

GFAP is the principal intermediate filament in mature astrocytes and has been investigated as a marker of astrocytic activation in AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis20. Inflammation is known to be part of the neurodegenerative process in SCA321, and astrocytes may play an important role, especially in early stages22,23.

UCHL1 is one of the most abundant proteins in the brain24 and, similarly to ataxin-3, intervenes in ubiquitination pathways25. UCHL1 has been linked to pathological processes in AD and PD24. Together with GFAP, UCHL1 has been proposed as a biomarker in TBI26,27.

NfL has emerged as an attractive biomarker in several neurological diseases11,28–31. In SCA3, NfL has been shown to be a promising biomarker when measured with a singleplex assay in several cohorts32–34, and with singleplex and homebrew duplex assays in cohorts partially replicated in the present study4,35.

We aim to investigate whether plasma levels of tau, GFAP and UCHL1 differ in SCA3 carriers compared to controls, and determine which variables influence the levels of such markers. Understanding these aspects could clarify the potential role of these molecules in future clinical trials. In addition, we aim to replicate the results for NfL in a SCA3 cohort using a multiplex assay.

METHODS

Study participants.

Our study comprised a main cohort and a replication cohort (Supplementary Table 1). The main cohort consisted of 143 ATXN3 mutation carriers and 172 unrelated healthy controls. The former group was divided into 23 preataxic carriers (SARA score&lt;3) and 120 ataxic patients (SARA score≥3). Mutation carriers and 56 controls were recruited through the ESMI study36, between November 2016 and January 2019. Additional age-matching control samples were obtained from two local repositories. ESMI participants underwent a standardized protocol including the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA)37, the Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS)38, the Activities of Daily Living questionnaire (ADL)39, and the SpinoCerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI)40. For mutation carriers who did not report an onset of gait ataxia, age of ataxia onset was predicted using a published formula for European populations41. A replication cohort was recruited via the Ataxia Biomarker Study Group from March 2018 to June 2019. This included healthy controls (n=34), preataxic (n=4) and ataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers (n=41). All centers received ethical approval from their local ethics committees. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment.

Sample collection.

Blood samples were collected using EDTA tubes and cell preparation tubes (BD Vacutainer CPT mononuclear cell preparation tube, sodium heparin), following a common protocol. CPT tubes were centrifuged at 1,700 g for 30 minutes at room temperature. Whole blood and plasma aliquots were then stored at −80°C. Participants’ ATXN3 genotype was determined as previously reported35. All mutation carriers had been genetically diagnosed, and the CAG repeat length was available for 22 preataxic carriers and 105 ataxic patients in the main cohort. CSF samples were obtained via lumbar puncture for 11 ATXN3 mutation carriers (3 preataxic carriers and 8 ataxic patients), following standard procedures. CSF samples were centrifuged at 1,100 g for 10 minutes, and aliquots were stored at −80°C.

Biomarker quantification.

Plasma samples were analyzed using the Neurology 4-Plex “A” kit on the Simoa HD-1 analyser (Quanterix, Billerica, MA, USA) at University College London and Mayo Clinic, following manufacturer instructions. The Simoa platform is an ultrasensitive digital ELISA as previously described42. The Neurology 4-Plex “A” kit allows the simultaneous quantification of total tau (t-tau), NfL, GFAP and UCHL143. For each sample, measurements were performed in duplicates, and average values with a coefficient of variation (CV) below 20% were considered. CSF t-tau and phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181) were quantified with conventional ELISA using, respectively, the Innotest hTau Ag assay and the Innotest Phospho-Tau(181P) kit (Fujirebio Europe N.V., Gent, Belgium).

Statistical analysis.

Data analysis was performed using Stata15.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA). Quantitative variables are presented as mean (SD) or median (minimum, maximum). Categorical variables are presented as percentages. Differences in means were analyzed with ANOVA (with Bonferroni correction for ad-hoc comparisons), Wilcoxon’s rank sum test or t-test. Analyte concentrations were transformed using the natural logarithm due to their right-skewed distributions. Spearman’s rho was used to examine correlations between CSF and plasma concentrations.

Effects of participant categories in biomarker concentrations were assessed with multiple linear regression, adjusting for confounders (age and sex) and first-order interactions between participant categories and the confounders. Dependent variables were the log-concentrations of the different analytes. Interaction terms were included if statistically significant (p&lt;0.05), whereas confounders were retained if they caused clinically significant changes in the main effect coefficients (more than 10%). Effects were reported as regression coefficients with their 95% CI and p-value. Classification performance of NfL was assessed through multiple logistic regression, with the logit(y=ataxic) as dependent variable, and the respective receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.

Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the predictors of the biomarkers’ concentrations in mutation carriers. Maximum models were fitted using available variables (age, sex, disease duration, number of CAG repeats, SARA, INAS, ADL, SCAFI) and all the possible equations were examined. Model selection was based on Mallows’ Cp criterion, adjusted-R2 and the principle of parsimony. Proportion of explained variability was expressed using adjusted-R2 values. Model assumptions were evaluated for all reported models.

Transgenic and wild-type (WT) animals.

MJD transgenic mice (MJDTg; C57BL/6 background) expressing the N-terminal-truncated human ataxin-3 with 69 glutamine repeats44, was maintained as previously described45. MJDTg and WT (C57BL/6) mice were selected at 4–5 weeks (4 MJDTg mice and 4 WT mice) and 8–9 weeks (3 MJDTg mice and 3 WT mice). MJDTg mice show an early phenotype at the age of 4–5 weeks consisting of reduced body weight, worse performance in the rotarod and cerebellar atrophy. While weak and diffuse accumulation of ataxin-3 is observed at early time-points, inclusion bodies appear around 6 weeks of age (P40), with increasing size and number thereafter44. The experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Community Council Directive (2010/63/EU) for the care and use of laboratory animals and previously approved by the Responsible Organization for the Animals Welfare of the Faculty of Medicine and Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology of the University of Coimbra (ORBEA and FMUC/CNC, Coimbra, Portugal) and the national authority Direcção Geral da Agricultura e Veterinária (DGAV, Portugal).

Cerebellar tissue collection and western blotting

Animals were given a ketamine/xylazine overdose (2×100 mg/kg ketamine+ xylazine 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and were transcardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline. Cerebella were dissected and stored at −80°C before use. Protein extracts and western blots were performed as previously described45. For these experiments, 15 μg of total protein extracts were run in the gel. A monoclonal anti-Tau (Tau46; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology) or mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (clone AC74; 1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich), diluted in blocking solution (5% non-fat milk in TBS-T), were used. An alkaline phosphatase-linked antibody specific to mouse IgG (1:20,000, Amersam Biosciences, GE Healthcare, UK) was used as secondary antibody. GraphPad Prism v.8.0.1 was used to analyze animal data.

RESULTS

Plasma t-tau concentrations are elevated in young preataxic and ataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers compared to controls.

Both study cohorts are described in Table 1. Unadjusted plasma t-tau concentrations were higher in preataxic carriers [0.77 log pg/mL (0.65)] compared to controls [0.37 log pg/mL (0.77); p=0.046], but they did not differ between ataxic SCA3 patients [0.51 log pg/mL (0.67)] and controls (p=0.374), or between preataxic and ataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers (p=0.377) (Fig 1A). After adjustment for age and sex, an interaction between the groups and age was detected (Fig 1B and Supplementary Table 2). When compared to controls, we found significantly higher t-tau levels in preataxic carriers for 30 years of age (0.42 log pg/mL higher compared to controls; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.77; p=0.020) and for ataxic patients for 30 (0.42 log pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.73, p=0.011) and 40 years of age (0.29 log pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.51, p=0.010). In addition, we observed that plasma t-tau levels decreased with increasing age, with a steeper reduction in ATXN3 mutation carriers.

We investigated the different predictors for plasma t-tau concentrations in preataxic and ataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers separately. In preataxic carriers, age (−0.04 log pg/mL per 1-year increase; 95% CI: −0.07, −0.01; p=0.008) and sex (0.51 log pg/mL increase in females compared to males; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.95; p=0.024) were the best predictors for plasma t-tau, explaining 42.91% of its variability.

For ataxic SCA3 patients, age (−0.03 log pg/mL per 1-year increase; 95% CI: −0.04, −0.02; p&lt;0.001) and sex (0.36 log pg/mL increase in females compared to males; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.60; p=0.003) accounted only for 16.20% of the variability in plasma t-tau. Adding the number of CAG repeats and the total INAS count increased the proportion of explained variability to 23.46%. INAS had a significant effect of 0.07 log pg/mL per 1-point increase (95% CI: 0.02, 0.12; p=0.004) (Fig 1C). Therefore, patients with higher INAS scores (reflecting a more complex neurological phenotype), will tend to display higher plasma t-tau concentrations. Although the coefficient for the number of CAG repeats was not significant (−0.04 log pg/mL per 1-CAG increase; 95% CI: −0.08, 0.01; p=0.090), this variable increased the proportion of explained variability, and was included in the best predictive model. No significant relationships were found with SARA or ADL and the inclusion of these variables did not produce better models.

To investigate if tau could be increased in early stages of SCA3, we measured t-tau and p-tau181 levels in our pilot CSF cohort. Median t-tau levels in preataxic subjects [384 pg/ml (309, 464)] were higher compared to ataxic patients [227 pg/ml (147, 322); p=0.025]. CSF t-tau concentrations in all the preataxic carriers were above 300 pg/mL, which has been reported as the cut-off value for healthy controls between 21 and 50 years of age46. Likewise, CSF p-tau181 levels in preataxic carriers [51 pg/mL (44, 63)] were greater than those in ataxic patients [32.5 pg/mL (14, 41), p=0.014]. Greater CSF t-tau concentrations were associated to higher CSF p-tau181 levels in the pooled cohort (rho=0.973, p&lt;0.001; Fig 1D). Plasma t-tau concentrations were not associated to levels of either CSF t-tau (rho=0.318, p=0.340, Fig 1E) or p-tau181 (rho=0.418, p=0.201). CSF t-tau and p-tau181 were not associated with age (respectively, p=0.537 and p=0.450), but higher concentrations of p-tau181 were associated with shorter disease duration (rho= −0.606 and p=0.048 for p-tau181, Fig 1F; rho= −0.551 and p=0.079 for t-tau, data not shown).

Cerebellar t-tau protein levels are increased in transgenic SCA3 mice in early stages of the disease.

Since we found higher plasma t-tau concentrations in young preataxic and ataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers compared to controls, and possibly increased CSF t-tau and p-tau181 levels in preataxic carriers compared to ataxic patients, we assessed whether this pattern was reproducible in relevant neurological tissues from an animal model of SCA3 (MJDTg)44. The levels of t-tau in cerebellar lysates from MJDTg mice were higher than the levels in lysates from WT animals at the age of 4–5 weeks (p=0.033; Fig 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). However, cerebellar t-tau levels were not different between both groups at the age of 8–9 weeks. There was a reduction in cerebellar t-tau levels in both groups over time, being the difference between 4–5 weeks and 8–9 weeks MJDTg mice statistically significant (p=0.001). Therefore, cerebellar t-tau levels in this animal model mirrored our findings in humans, since they showed an increase in early symptomatic MJDTg mice compared to WT mice, and t-tau levels decreased with advancing age.

Plasma GFAP and UCHL1 did not show higher levels in mutation carriers compared to controls.

When plasma GFAP concentrations were adjusted by age and sex, carriers showed significant lower concentrations compared to controls: −0.45 log pg/mL for preataxic carriers (95% CI: −0.71, −0.21; p&lt;0.001) and −0.20 log pg/mL for ataxic patients (95% CI: −0.33, −0.06; p=0.004). Age and sex explained 23.35% of the variability in GFAP, with minimal increment when considering the type of subject (27.25%). GFAP showed a steady rise with increasing age, similar for the three groups. In the replication cohort, GFAP did not differ among groups.

Unadjusted plasma UCHL1 concentrations were lower in preataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers [2.55 log pg/mL (1.10)] compared to controls [3.03 log pg/mL (1.44); p=0.046], but levels in controls and ataxic participants were similar [2.65 log pg/mL (1.21); p=0.374]. However, these results were calculated using a smaller subset of samples with a CV&lt;20% (43.7% of the total).

Plasma NfL concentrations are raised in ATXN3 mutation carriers compared to controls, and this difference is most marked for younger subjects.

In the main cohort, unadjusted mean NfL levels in ataxic [3.26 log pg/mL (0.46)] and preataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers [2.70 log pg/mL (0.47)] were higher than the value in controls [2.31 log pg/mL (0.83); respectively, p&lt;0.001 and p=0.032] (Fig 3A). We included age and sex as confounders and detected an interaction between the participant categories and age (Fig 3B). Therefore, differences in NfL among groups will vary depending on participants’ age, being greater in younger participants (Supplementary Table 3).

The classification performance of NfL in differentiating ataxic SCA3 patients from controls was analyzed through a multiple logistic regression model (adjusting by age and its interaction). In our model, a rise in one log-unit in NfL increased the odds of being classified as ataxic, but such effect was attenuated with increasing age [coefficient for logNfL: 8.38–0.11x(age), Fig 3C]. The ROC curve for this model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.95) (Fig 3D). When preataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers and controls were compared, the model yielded an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.93). The inclusion of tau and its interaction with age did not produce models with improved AUC values.

In the replication cohort, unadjusted mean NfL reproduced the findings of the main cohort, with ataxic SCA3 [3.47 log pg/mL (0.36)] showing higher levels compared to controls [2.45 log pg/mL (0.53); P&lt;0.001]. Adjusted differences between ataxic SCA3 patients and controls were greater for younger subjects. The model to measure NfL classification performance yielded an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.00).

Different variables predict plasma NfL in preataxic and ataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers.

We investigated the predictors of plasma NfL in ataxic and preataxic carriers separately. In ataxic SCA3 patients, both age (0.012 log pg/mL per 1-year increase; 95% CI: 0.002, 0.022; p=0.022) and number of CAG repeats (0.034 log pg/mL per 1-repeat increase; 95% CI: 0.004, 0.064; p=0.025) accounted only for 4.2% of the variability in NfL. In contrast, in preataxic carriers, the effects of age (0.051 log pg/mL per 1-year increase; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.084; p=0.005) and number of CAG repeats (0.090 log pg/mL per 1-repeat increase; 95% CI: 0.018, 0.163; p=0.018) were greater and explained 30.63% of NfL variation.

We then investigated the effect of variables quantifying disease progression in ataxic patients. Thus, we found that SARA score was associated with NfL (0.025 log pg/mL per 1-point increase; 95% CI: 0.015, 0.034; p&lt;0.001), yielding a percentage of explained NfL variability of 20.38% (Fig 3E). The effect of INAS in NfL levels was non-significant (p=0.309). In the case of ADL, its effect (0.016 log pg/mL per 1-point increase; 95% CI: −0.001, 0.025; p=0.082) was close to the threshold of significance and showed similar magnitude to the relationship found with SARA. The effect of SCAFI was also significant (−0.173 log pg/mL per 1-Z-score increase; 95% CI: −0.257, −0.089; p&lt;0.001), although this estimation was calculated with only 80.8% of the patients.

DISCUSSION

We have presented the quantification of four different brain-enriched proteins in a large SCA3 cohort, comprised of patients with diverse origins, ages and stages of the disease. Our comprehensive control group allowed us to describe changes depending on age and define which subsets of patients were more likely to display significant changes.

Our results suggest that tau levels could be increased in ATXN3 mutation carriers in early stages of the disease. Firstly, in our main cohort, mutation carriers under 50 years of age showed higher plasma t-tau concentrations compared to controls and their plasma levels decreased with increasing age. Secondly, CSF t-tau and p-tau181 concentrations could be elevated in preataxic ATXN3 mutation carriers compared to ataxic patients. Finally, higher cerebellar t-tau levels were found in early stages of the disease in MJDTg mice when compared to young WT animals and MJDTg mice in a more advanced stage.

Increased CSF t-tau has been found in various neurological conditions, such as AD10,11,47, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)10–14, MSA18,47, HD15 and cases of encephalopathy/encephalitis10,11,47. Therefore, CSF t-tau is considered a marker of neuronal damage elicited by different insults. In a recent report48, CSF tau and p-tau181 levels were similar between SCA3 patients and controls. However, in that study, the mean age of both groups differed, preataxic carriers were not included, and the differences were not age-adjusted. Interestingly, our results might indicate that tau levels are elevated early in the disease course and decrease over time. In a previous study in AD, CSF t-tau and p-tau181 showed a reduction over time in a cohort of AD patients, which differed from the increase in the control and the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups49.

Plasma t-tau has been shown to be elevated in AD patients when compared to MCI and control participants, being associated to worse progression in different clinical and radiological variables in the AD group9. In CJD, plasma t-tau showed a better classification performance than NfL when comparing patients with CJD to patients with non-prion rapidly progressive dementias, and higher plasma t-tau levels were associated to a shorter survival in sporadic CJD patients for the subtype VV212. We found that younger ATXN3 mutation carriers showed higher t-tau concentrations that decrease with increasing age. In our cohort, the INAS count was associated with plasma t-tau levels. This might represent a relationship between plasma t-tau and the complexity of the phenotype in SCA3. In addition, female carriers showed higher plasma t-tau concentrations compared to males. In a previous natural history study, female ATXN3 carriers were found to have a faster progression in the number of non-ataxia signs compared to males50. This difference was only present for SCA3, and not for SCA1, SCA2 or SCA6. Therefore, the effect of the carrier’s sex in plasma t-tau could be also related to the complexity of the SCA3 phenotype.

Our results suggest an interesting link between tau and SCA3, and could represent a potential use of this protein as a marker of early disease stages. The pathogenic role of tau is being progressively unraveled for other polyglutamine disorders. In HD brains, different studies have found an increase in the 4R/3R isoform tau ratio51,52, with hyperphosphorylated tau nuclear rods in striatum and cortex (which partially co-localize with mutant huntingtin)51,52. In addition, the MAPT H2 haplotype was associated to a higher rate of cognitive decline in a HD cohort52. Several hypotheses could explain why tau levels are preferentially higher in early stages in SCA3. Firstly, the neurodegenerative process might be more pronounced in early stages of the disease, with a subsequent stabilization when patients reach the fully symptomatic stage. A previous study found that several CSF markers of neuronal injury (including t-tau) decreased over time in AD49. The authors hypothesized whether this could be a consequence of the slowing of the neurodegenerative process or a result of the reduced number of neurons over time. In addition, they pointed the discrepancies between imaging and biofluid markers, as the latter do not represent cumulative changes. Secondly, increased tau levels could reflect early pathophysiological changes in the neurodegenerative process. Tau has been shown to interact with vesicle-associated proteins at presynaptic terminals and with proteins involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics53. Hypothetically, early synaptic and mitochondrial failure, as well as the cytoskeletal dysfunction in SCA354–56, could elicit an increase in tau concentrations. In later stages, these phenomena would be sequentially overridden by axonal loss (mirrored by a progressive rise in NfL) and neuronal cell loss. Finally, there could be a progressive dysregulation of tau expression in the SCA3 disease course, as shown in a preliminary study19. Nonetheless, for its implementation as a biomarker in SCA3, further studies in tau kinetics in CSF and blood will be required, as well as longitudinal clinical studies in large patient cohorts.

In our cohort, we did not find higher plasma GFAP levels in ATXN3 mutation carriers compared to controls. This could indicate that astrocytic activation is not a major component in SCA3 neurodegeneration, or that such activation is not translated into higher plasma levels. A previous report found increased plasma GFAP concentrations in SCA3 patients using a different methodology57. However, mean GFAP concentrations in our study were one to two orders of magnitude lower, which reflects the higher sensitivity of our method. Although there is evidence that GFAP transcription is increased with ageing58, previous studies could not corroborate such age-dependency of its peripheral levels. Our data confirms that plasma GFAP concentrations are age-dependent, and that age is an important predictor of GFAP. Although UCHL1 has shown some value in TBI26,27, the low reliability of our method with lower plasma values prevents us to draw valid conclusions regarding its role in SCA3.

The higher plasma NfL levels in ATXN3 mutation carriers, measured using a multiplexed assay with other biomarkers, reproduced the findings of other studies in SCA332–34, replicated the previously published results of NfL in a subset of samples from the present cohort measured with singleplex and duplex assays4,35, and are in agreement with the results in other neurodegenerative disorders11,28–31. Interestingly, differences in plasma NfL between SCA3 carriers and controls were greater for younger participants. This is explained by the fact that NfL concentrations were elevated since early stages of the disease, whereas, in control subjects, NfL slowly raises with increasing age. If future treatments achieve a halt in the neurodegenerative process, younger patients might show greater absolute reductions in their plasma NfL concentrations, compared to older patients. This would produce higher effect sizes in younger patients and, therefore, require a smaller sample size. The results in our main cohort were supported by the replication cohort, in which the good classification performance of NfL in differentiating ataxic SCA3 from controls was also found.

From the set of variables analyzed here, we can conclude that age and number of CAG repeats accounted for almost a third of NfL variability in preataxic carriers and, therefore, they may be important drivers of the neurodegenerative process in this group. Surprisingly, in ataxic patients, age and number of CAG were not strong determinants of NfL levels (4.2% of explained variability). Instead, variables that reflect disease status (e.g., SARA, SCAFI) were strongly associated and explained a higher proportion of variability. Therefore, clinical stage seems to be the main driver of NfL concentrations once the carrier has reached the ataxic stage. The association between plasma NfL concentrations and SARA has also been found in previous studies33,35. However, we did not find the previously reported association between NfL and INAS33, as the effect of the INAS score was not significant after adjustment by SARA. A good understanding of the determinants of NfL will be necessary for its use as progression biomarkers in future clinical trials. Our data suggests that, while NfL concentrations are likely to change with age in preataxic carriers, such change will not be as marked in ataxic patients, where NfL might be more stable over time, especially if the subject has a mild disease course. To confirm these hypotheses, longitudinal data in large cohorts and collection of other variables that inform of the rate of neurodegeneration (e.g., MRI data) will be required. Since the predictors of NfL in preclinical and clinical phases might diverge, considering these two phases as separate groups might lead to better predictive models than the ones reported so far32,35.

Our study has some limitations. The cross-sectional design prevented us from exploring changes in biomarker concentrations over time. Also, our preataxic group was reduced compared to the ataxic and control groups, and this poses difficulties to study variables that influence biomarker concentrations. The CSF and animal data is limited, and these exploratory results should be replicated in larger groups. Another caveat is the poor association between CSF and plasma tau concentrations, which is in agreement with previous studies in other conditions9,59, and that could indicate a different behavior between CSF and plasma tau levels. Plasma t-tau concentrations showed some overlap between ATXN3 carriers and controls, and more sensitive methods or the quantification of specific isoforms might yield more informative results.

In conclusion, our results suggest that tau is elevated early in SCA3, and its levels decrease over time. This warrants further research to unravel the role of tau in SCA3 and its potential role as marker of early stages. NfL has shown consistent results with other studies, with greater levels in ATXN3 mutation carriers and associations to participants’ characteristics (age, number of CAG repeats) and clinical variables (SARA score, SCAFI). Therefore, NfL shows potential to be a good candidate as a biomarker for SCA3, which will need to be confirmed in longitudinal studies carried out in large cohorts before it can be implemented in clinical trials.
