Background and Purpose

To assess prognostic efficacy of individual versus combined regional volumetrics in two commercially-available brain volumetric software packages for predicting conversion of patients with mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease.

Materials and Methods

Data was obtained through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 192 subjects (mean age 74.8 years, 39% female) diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment at baseline were studied. All had T1WI MRI sequences at baseline and 3-year clinical follow-up. Analysis was performed with NeuroQuant® and Neuroreader™. Receiver operating characteristic curves assessing the prognostic efficacy of each software package were generated using a univariable approach employing individual regional brain volumes, as well as two multivariable approaches (multiple regression and random forest), combining multiple volumes.

Results

On univariable analysis of 11 NeuroQuant® and 11 Neuroreader™ regional volumes, hippocampal volume had the highest area under the curve for both software packages (0.69 NeuroQuant®, 0.68 Neuroreader™), and was not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05) between packages. Multivariable analysis did not increase the area under the curve for either package (0.63 logistic regression, 0.60 random forest NeuroQuant®; 0.65 logistic regression, 0.62 random forest Neuroreader™).

Conclusion

Of the multiple regional volume measures available in FDA-cleared brain volumetric software packages, hippocampal volume remains the best single predictor of conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease at 3-year follow-up. Combining volumetrics did not add additional prognostic efficacy. Therefore, future prognostic studies in MCI, combining such tools with demographic and other biomarker measures, are justified in using hippocampal volume as the only volumetric biomarker.


INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death and brain atrophy. Atrophy of specific medial temporal lobe structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus, has been associated with the future development of AD in numerous research studies (1-9). However, use of this information in the clinical care of patients with memory impairment for prognosis remains challenging(10, 11). Medial temporal lobe volume assessments of MRI scans with visual ratings, or manual or semi-manual volumetric processing, have been difficult to implement in a busy clinical environment due to high inter-observer variability of raters and/or the time-consuming nature of obtaining these measurements (12). These problems have been addressed through the use of fully-automated segmentation algorithms available in commercial software programs, providing the user with immediate, detailed volumetric analysis of the hippocampus, and other brain regions, which is more sensitive than visual analysis (13).

Because the atrophy pattern in prodromal AD is spatially distributed, including regions beyond the hippocampus, such as the lateral and inferior temporal lobe, the parietal lobe and cingulate gyrus (14), incorporation of such information may enhance the prognostic capability of these currently available tools. Indeed, pattern analysis techniques, incorporating whole brain morphologic information(15-19), have been harnessed for this purpose and have shown high prognostic value in individual patients. Such techniques, however, have not yet been implemented in commercially available products. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic efficacy of utilizing the complete set of raw volumetric measures available in two fully automated, commercially-available brain volumetric software packages. Such tools have been FDA 510(k) cleared for clinical use, but not yet validated for specific diagnostic or prognostic purposes in AD. We sought to determine whether combining volumetrics using multivariable approaches, including machine-learning (20-22), would add to the prognostic efficacy of individual measures alone, such as hippocampal volume, in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. We hypothesized that the multivariable approach would enhance the prognostic value of already existing individual measures available in commercial volumetric software.

METHODS

Subjects

All subjects’ data were available through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a multicenter trial with a publicly available database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org. All subjects classified as MCI under ADNI1 or late-MCI under ADNI-GO, with baseline MRI imaging, and a baseline and 3-year clinical assessment available on or before November 11, 2013 were selected.

Conversion of MCI to AD was based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable or possible AD, determined by review from a committee according to protocol guidelines. Those subjects that did not fulfill these criteria for conversion were defined as non-converters, which included MCI subjects and subjects that reverted back to normal.

Image Acquisition and Image Analysis

All subjects underwent MRI brain imaging at 1.5T or 3.0T with sagittal 3D T1-weighted (MP-RAGE) scans. Further details on the MR scanner protocol and MR image acquisition is available elsewhere (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mri-protocols/). Because we selected only late-MCI subjects from ADNI-GO, all subjects were therefore previous members of ADNI-1 and had their original scan with the ADNI-1 protocol. The MP-RAGE sequence was processed with NeuroQuant® (NQ) (San Diego, California) (original version 1.0), which is a commercially available automated image analysis software program (http://www.cortechslabs.com/neuroquant/). Separate left and right volumes, available in the generated morphometry report, were combined into a total volume for the following 11 brain regions (features): amygdala, caudate, cerebellum, cortical gray matter, forebrain parenchyma, hippocampus, inferior lateral ventricle, lateral ventricle, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus.

In addition, the MP-RAGE sequence was also processed with Neuroreader™ (NR) (Horsens, Denmark), another commercially available software program for volumetric segmentation (http://brainreader.net/)(23). Both NQ and NR are FDA 510(k) cleared and “intended for automatic labeling, visualization, and volumetric quantification of segmentable brain structures from a set of MR images.” Because the NR volumetric report yielded many more regions compared to NQ, 11 regions yielding the best individual predictions were chosen from the NR morphometry report to keep the models equally parsimonious. Combined bilateral volumes were obtained for the following 11 brain regions (features): amygdala, cerebellum, frontal lobe, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, occipital lobe, parietal lobe, putamen, temporal lobe, thalamus, and ventral diencephalon. Technical aspects of these commercial software packages have been previously described in detail (24, 25).

Of note, all ADNI studies included two SPGR/MP-RAGE sequences done back-to-back, the original and a repeat sequence accelerated by parallel imaging. In cases where the original MP-RAGE sequence could not be processed by the NR or NQ programs, the repeat MP-RAGE sequence was used instead. If processing also failed on the repeat sequence, with either NR or NQ, the case was excluded from all further analysis. All image processing and analyses were performed by two authors (T.P.T. and J.I.). Sample segmentations from NQ and NR are shown in Figure 1a.

Statistical Analysis

Demographics were compared between the MCI converter and nonconverter groups using a two-sample Student's t test, assuming equal variance where appropriate. To assess the prognostic performance of individual features and multivariable models combining the features, we used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methodology. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to summarize the performance. Comparison of AUC's was performed using the Delong method (26).

In order to test whether a combination of the features would outperform models based on a single brain region, we constructed two multivariable models: a classical multivariable logistic regression model and a more novel machine learning method called random forest classifier (27). For the random forest classifier, 2000 trees were used. Leave-one-out cross validation method was used for training and testing of the multivariable models. In addition to the data-driven multivariable models, we also tested one apriori multivariable model, known as the hippocampal occupancy (HOC) score, defined as the ratio of hippocampal volume to the sum of hippocampal and inferior lateral ventricle volumes. This measure is thought to differentiate individuals with congenitally small hippocampi from those with degeneration (28). The HOC score for each separate hemisphere was averaged in order to provide a single composite measurement. Because inferior lateral ventricle (temporal horn) volume was not available for NR, this measure was only calculated with NQ.

To assess correlations between assessment of the same volume by the NQ and NR software, we used Pearson correlation. Statistical analyses were performed with MATLAB (ver. 8.1.0.604, R2013a), R (ver 3.1.3) and JMP (ver 11.0) software packages.

RESULTS

There were initially 281 subjects identified in the ADNI databases meeting inclusion criteria. 84 (29.9%) subjects were excluded due to failure to generate a NQ morphometry report. 5 (1.8%) subjects were excluded for other reasons, including failure to generate a NR morphometry report. There were a total of 192 remaining subjects who met inclusion and exclusion criteria. All subjects had a 3 year clinical follow-up visit recorded. Mean follow-up was 3.05 years, with a standard deviation of 0.14 years (range: 2.47 years to 3.63 years). All 192 included subjects were diagnosed as MCI at baseline and all started under the ADNI-1 protocol. At the end of the 3 year follow-up, 186/192 subjects had their 3 year evaluation under the ADNI-1 protocol and 6/192 subjects had their 3 year evaluation under the ADNI-GO protocol. For the 192 subjects, at the 3 year follow-up, the final diagnosis was AD in 85/192 (44.3%), MCI in 99/192 (51.6%), and normal in 8/192 (4.2%).

Characteristics of the study populations are listed in Table 1. Two subjects did not have ADAS-13 scores at baseline. There were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05) between the MCI (nonconverter) and AD (converter) groups in terms of age, gender, or education. There was a significant difference (p &lt; 0.0001) in ADAS-13 score at baseline and MMSE score at baseline between the two groups. The AUC for predicting conversion at baseline was 0.76 and 0.68 for the ADAS-13 and MMSE, respectively.

AUC values for NQ and NR are listed in Table 2. With NQ, the most predictive feature for conversion of MCI to AD was hippocampal volume, with an AUC of 0.69. The most predictive feature for NR was also hippocampal volume, with an AUC of 0.68. The multivariable analysis did not improve on either of these.

Intracranial volume (ICV) normalization did not result in improvement in the performance of hippocampal volume in the linear model (AUC = 0.65 for NQ, and 0.61 for NR), nor did adding age as a covariate to the ICV normalized hippocampal volumes result in improvement (AUC = 0.66 for NQ, and 0.62 for NR).

With NR, the AUC value for the hippocampus was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) than the AUC value for the cerebellum, lateral ventricle, and the thalamus. With NQ, the AUC value for the hippocampus was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.05) than the AUC value for the caudate, cerebellum, lateral ventricle, pallidum, putamen, and the thalamus.

There was no statistically significant difference in AUC values using hippocampal volumes obtained by NR versus NQ (p = 0.657).

Pearson correlation coefficients are listed in Table 3. There was a statistically significant correlation between NQ and NR absolute volumes in all compatible regions tested: thalamus, lateral ventricle, hippocampus, cerebellum, putamen and amygdala (p &lt; 0.05). The scatter plot and Bland-Altman plot for hippocampal volume are shown in Figure 1b. There was a small bias of NR with respect to NQ of −0.12 (CI −0.02, −0.22) ml.

The AUC for the HOC score was 0.64 (CI 0.56, 0.72). There was no statistically significant difference in AUC values using the NQ HOC score versus NQ hippocampal volume (p = 0.1827).

DISCUSSION

Our study, using the complete set of raw volumetric measures available in two fully automated, commercially-available brain volumetric software packages, confirms previous studies documenting the prognostic utility of hippocampal volume in patients with MCI. Indeed, hippocampal volumes provided the highest prognostic value of all individual regions available in both the NQ and NR volumetric reports. Multivariable analysis, including the use of a cross-validated machine-based learning classifier algorithm, which incorporated other brain regions available in these software packages, did not provide additional predictive value compared to a model based on just hippocampal volumes. The results of our study are in agreement with previous studies that have found hippocampal volumes to be most predictive of conversion of MCI to AD, with little added benefit from additional brain regions. For example, a large study of ADNI patients using semi-automated methods reported that hippocampal volumes were the most predictive of conversion as compared with other regional and whole brain measures (29). Automated volumetric measurements of the hippocampus also had high predictive values in predicting conversion (2). A 2-year clinical follow-up study of MCI patients using manual methods demonstrated that baseline hippocampal volumes had high predictive value (5). Despite the differences in segmentation techniques (manual, semi-automated, and automated) among the three studies, all these studies reported that hippocampal volumes were the most predictive of MCI conversion.

On the other hand, a number of previous studies have implicated brain regions other than the hippocampus as either adding to the prognostic value of hippocampal volume, or as having significant prognostic value in their own right, though direct comparison with our study is limited due to differences in methodologies and primary outcomes. In one study using manual methods, a bivariate model of hippocampal volumes and follow-up changes to either ventricular volume or whole brain volume were shown to have prognostic value in predicting conversion of MCI to AD (7). Another study using automated methods found that amygdala and caudate nucleus volumes were predictive of MCI conversion, whereas hippocampal were not (12). A separate study with automated methods reported that deep gray matter structures, including the amygdala, thalamus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens, were predictive of conversion of MCI to AD, in addition to the hippocampus (30). Temporal horn volumes were shown to be more predictive than hippocampal volumes in one study using semi-automated methods (31), whereas left lateral temporal lobe and left parietal cortex were the most predictive factors in another study using automated methods (32). A likely reason for discrepancies with these studies is that volume loss in AD-affected regions is correlated with that of the hippocampus, and these co-linear effects are therefore lost in the multivariable model when hippocampal volume is accounted for. For example, in our study, volume of the hippocampus was highly correlated with that of the amygdala (r = 0.71) and cortical gray matter (r = 0.52) for NQ, and amygdala (r = 0.75) and temporal lobe (r = 0.57) for NR. Another explanation for the differences in results, as compared to our study, could be the use of different segmentation methods. In our study, we used an automated segmentation method with NQ and NR, which may be less accurate in measuring smaller and deeper structures compared with manual or semi-automated segmentation methods.

Also of note in this study, HOC score, a composite index of hippocampal and temporal horn volume, did not outperform hippocampal volume alone. The HOC score has been advocated as a more accurate measurement of hippocampal tissue loss that accounts for individual variations in hippocampal size by accounting for temporal horn volume. In our study population, temporal horn volume was somewhat co-linear with hippocampal volume (r = –0.33), and we did not find the HOC to be more predictive for conversion than hippocampal volume alone, suggesting that the additional variance added by temporal horn volume might be redundant information and/or noise. Although temporal horn volume was a significant predictor of conversion in the univariable logistic regression model, it lost significance when hippocampal volume was added to the model, and negligibly increased the AUC. Nevertheless, our results do not exclude that combining these two measures may be helpful in the preclinical or mild dementia phases of the disease spectrum.

Our study has several limitations. It was theoretically possible that the ROC area for hippocampal volume might be larger if hippocampal volumes were normalized to ICV and adjusted for age (33). Such corrections might adjust for bias across subjects and ICV-normalized and age-adjusted values are available in the volumetric reports. Nevertheless, for our primary analysis, we chose to use the raw values, in keeping with our purpose to compare single versus combined measures within the same subjects, which should not be significantly affected by normalizing by ICV, a practice which could introduce additional noise into the measures. Though age may differentially affect various brain regions, we did not have age-adjusted values available for most regions in the NQ volumetric report, and therefore did not include these measures in our primary analysis. Even so, secondary analyses of hippocampal volume using ICV normalization, as well as including age as a covariate in the linear model, did not yield additional prognostic efficacy. Of note, one group, the Coalition Against Major Diseases, reported higher AUC values for the prediction of MCI conversion to AD (in 2 years) in their de novo analysis, based on automated hippocampal volume obtained by several methods, 0.7565 (LEAP), 0.7516 (NeuroQuant), 0.7536 (FreeSurfer), and 0.7290 (HMAPS) (34). However, the same committee also reported a range of AUC values between 0.60 and 0.77 based on their literature review, and our results are within this range.

Both the NQ and NR programs provide a large number of data values (55 for the general morphometry report through NQ, 140 for the NR report) that we did not fully include in our machine-based learning classifier program. It is known that increasing number of features can hurt performance of a classifier given a limited sample size. Initially, we found that the addition of the full data set resulted in a worse predictive value for MCI conversion, which we speculate was due to overfitting of the training samples. This is a common phenomenon when the number of predictor variables is high compared to the number of subjects in the training set (35). Hence, we decided to limit our analysis to the most promising features provided in the NQ and NR volumetric reports.

In some cases, we were not able to process the MRI images for the baseline sequence, which excluded some patients from the study, all of whom were chosen through the ADNI database. In total, 89 out of 281 patients were excluded due to inadequate NQ or NR morphometry data. This was most often due to patient age and gender missing from the anonomized header information, a requirement of the NQ processing pipeline, but a situation unlikely to occur in clinical practice as these are standard DICOM data fields. In addition, some patients had inadequate MP-RAGE sequences due to technical factors, including motion, which we were not able to segment using the NQ or NR programs; in these cases, we substituted a repeat MP-RAGE sequence. Despite occasional differences in ability to process a particular sequence, we found a strong linear correlation (r &gt; 0.60) between NQ and NR for all compatible regions tested. Of interest, for hippocampal volume, there was a small underestimation bias of NR with respect to NQ, which may be attributable to different segmentation algorithms. Two outliers were noted, showing differences of approximately ±3 ml between software packages, which were attributable to segmentation differences.

Another limitation is that we did not incorporate biomarkers, neuropsychological assessments or longitudinal imaging measures in our study. Rather we sought to limit our study to testing the prognostic efficacy of two commercially available brain volumetric software packages in their own right, rather than using additional data which might confound direct comparisons. Of note, the MMSE and ADAS-13 AUC were as high as, or higher than, that of hippocampal volume alone, in agreement with previous studies looking at the prognostic efficacy of multiple biomarkers in MCI (36). This result is not surprising given that a dichotomous endpoint measure, conversion, was used to assess cognitive decline, and cognitive measures at baseline would be expected to strongly predict how close a subject is to the point of conversion. Future efforts in evaluating the prognostic efficacy of these software packages should involve combining volumetric data with a suite of biomarkers and neuropsychological assessments using machine-based learning approaches, and employing continuous, rather than categorical, outcomes of cognitive decline. Subject factors such as financial or socioeconomic factors also remained unadjusted in the analysis. These factors would unlikely affect the within-subject design and were omitted to keep the comparison straightforward between single versus multiple volumetric outputs directly available from the imaging software packages.

Despite these limitations, our study had several strengths, including a large sample size of 192 patients through the ADNI database. Indeed, ADNI uses a wide variety of vendor platforms, field strengths and harmonized pulse sequences which patients are likely to encounter in future clinical settings. We also selected for patients with 3-year clinical follow-up, which provided a more accurate designation of future conversion status, compared to studies with shorter follow-up duration.

CONCLUSIONS

Of the multiple regional volume measures available in current FDA-cleared brain volumetric software, hippocampal volume remains the best single predictor of MCI conversion to AD at 3-year follow-up. Combining volumetrics, using multivariable approaches including a machine-learning classifier, does not appear to add additional prognostic efficacy. Therefore, future prognostic studies in MCI, combining such tools with demographic and other biomarker measures, are justified in using hippocampal volume as the only volumetric biomarker.
