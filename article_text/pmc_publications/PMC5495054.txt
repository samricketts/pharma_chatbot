Small molecules are powerful probes of the aggregation process, helping to reveal the key steps and serving as diagnostics and reporters. Moreover, some of these small molecules may have potential as therapeutics. This review details how small molecules and chemical biology have helped to elucidate the mechanisms of tau aggregation and how they are being used to detect and prevent tau aggregation. In addition, we comment on how new insights into tau prions are changing the approach to small molecule discovery.

TOC Blurb
Tau aggregation is linked to neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease). Molecules that bind to tau and accelerate, inhibit, modify, or detect its aggregation have been important research and diagnostic tools.


   INTRODUCTION TO TAU BIOLOGY AND PATHOBIOLOGY
Microtubule-binding protein tau (MAPTor tau) is abundantly expressed in neurons and is thought to assist in axonal transport by stabilizing microtubules (Drechsel et al. 1992; Brandt et al. 2005). In humans, tau occurs as six main isoforms generated by alternative splicing of a single gene on chromosome 17. These isoforms contain either three or four repeat domains in their C-terminus (i.e., 3R or 4R tau), and these repeat domains are responsible for tau’s adherence to microtubules (Butner and Kirschner 1991; Mukrasch et al. 2005). Tau is a highly soluble protein, yet it aggregates into insoluble fibers in Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies. Tau behaves as an intrinsically disordered protein, and various methods have determined it to be largely random coil in solution (Schweers et al. 1994; Mukrasch et al. 2005; Jeganathan et al. 2008). During aggregation, however, it adopts a cross β-sheet structure reminiscent of other amyloidogenic proteins (e.g., amyloid-β, α-synuclein) (von Bergen et al. 2000; Daebel et al. 2012). This conformation allows for non-native interactions between tau monomers, leading to fibrillization (Fig. 1). These fibrils accumulate within neuron cell bodies and dendrites (Brandt et al. 2005; Avila 2006), forming paired-helical filaments (PHFs) that combine into neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (Kosik et al. 1986; Lee et al. 1991). Aggregated tau is proteotoxic in model systems, suggesting that oligomeric and/or fibrillar tau may contribute to neurodegeneration (Khlistunova et al. 2006; Lasagna-Reeves et al. 2011). Therefore, it has been suggested that blocking aggregation may halt disease progression (Bulic et al. 2010). Most recently, tau has been found to behave as a prion, passing from cell to cell to propagate its own aggregation (Brunden et al. 2008; Clavaguera et al. 2015; Stancu et al. 2015; see also Holmes and Diamond 2016.)

Tau is subject to multiple types of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation, proteolytic processing, ubiquitination, glycosylation, nitration, and acetylation (Hanger et al. 2009; Min et al. 2010; Martin et al. 2011; Morris et al 2015). Many of these events appear to impact the localization of tau and its propensity to aggregate. Accordingly, the enzymes responsible for posttranslational modifications have emerged as possible drug targets. These efforts have been reviewed elsewhere (Schneider and Mandelkow 2008; Lee et al. 2011). Rather, we focus on how small molecules can directly probe tau aggregation. Molecules that bind directly to tau have been critical in advancing our understanding of how tau aggregates and what features of the protein are important. Indeed, the tau-binding molecules Congo red and thioflavin T (ThT) were essential to the initial discovery and characterization of NFTs, and they play an ongoing role in probing tau structure–function. In addition, molecules that inhibit tau aggregation or redirect it toward nonfibrillar outcomes have been discovered, and these compounds have revealed key steps in the process. Most recently, tau ligands have advanced as important imaging agents, with the promise of revolutionizing clinical diagnosis of tauopathies. Together, the interactions between tau and small molecules have provided invaluable insight. Yet, challenges remain, and the path toward therapeutics for tauopathies remains uncertain. In this review, we discuss both the successes and failures, with the aim of stimulating new approaches to the discovery of molecules that bind to tau.

AGGREGATION AGONISTS
Unlike other amyloid-prone proteins, such as amyloid-β or α-synuclein, efforts to study tau aggregation in vitro initially faced a challenge, as tau would only form fibrils under nonphysiological concentrations and with impractically long reaction times (Kosik et al. 1988; Crowther et al. 1994; King et al. 1999). In cellular models, this barrier appeared to be overcome by over-expression, introducing disease-associated mutations/truncations and/or inducing PTMs (Götz et al. 1995; Duff et al. 2000; Tanemura et al. 2001; Sato et al. 2002). However, a breakthrough came when it was found that purified tau could be made to fibrilize in vitro by the addition of negatively charged cofactors, such as heparin, fatty acids and other lipids, carboxylated microspheres, or RNA (Kampers et al. 1996; Pérez et al. 1996; Hasegawa et al. 1997; Wilson and Binder 1997). These accelerants are all anionic, suggesting that mitigating charge repulsion is a critical feature of tau aggregation. Indeed, tau is composed of an acidic N-terminal domain, a middle proline-rich region, and a highly basic C-terminal domain. Under normal conditions, the positive charges in the C-terminal repeat regions are responsible for interacting with a negatively charged region of tubulin (Mukrasch et al. 2005; Sillen et al. 2007). Thus, anionic molecules seem to facilitate tau–tau interactions by attenuating the electrostatic repulsions in the critical C-terminal region (Goedert et al. 1996). This interaction allows for conformational transitions that are known to be essential for tau fibrillogenesis (von Bergen et al. 2000). Once an aggregation nucleus is formed, the fibril can propagate through addition of more monomers (Congdon et al. 2008). This model is made clear by studies using anionic polymers (i.e., lipid micelles). In these systems, tau adopts a β-sheet structure on the micelle and then aggregates. The speed of this process is dictated by the concentration of negative charges (Chirita and Kuret 2004).

What is the natural aggregation agonist in vivo? RNA and lipid membranes are likely candidates, as both have shown to be potent aggregation inducers in vitro and are known to interact with tau in cells (Brandt et al. 1995; Farah et al. 2006; Violet et al. 2014). Planar molecules, such as thiazine red, have been shown to cause aggregation at high concentrations (Chirita et al. 2005), suggesting that perhaps certain natural metabolites or materials could also spark aggregation under some conditions. Moreover, other factors within the cell, such as oxidative stress, and changes within tau itself, such as PTMs, are expected to influence aggregation in vivo (Avila et al. 2006). For example, some phosphorylations are known to release tau from microtubules and hyperphosphorylated tau is a major component of PHFs (Hasegawa et al. 1992; Biernat et al. 1993). It is not yet clear whether all aggregation agonists act equally on all tau variants. Further, it remains to be elucidated which natural agonists might be important in the conversion of tau to prions or whether they are involved in the propagation of prion conformers. It is also interesting to speculate that different natural agonists might favor distinct “strains” of tau prions. This seems like an area in which small molecules might play important roles in the future.

AGGREGATION REPORTERS
Like other amyloid-prone proteins, tau adopts a conformation consisting of parallel, in-register β-sheets oriented perpendicular to the filament axis. The structural similarity between tau and other amyloidogenic proteins is convenient because several fluorescent ligands previously discovered as aggregation reporters for other amyloidogenic proteins (Vassar and Culling 1959; Kelenyi 1967; Naiki et al. 1989) have also proven useful in studying tau. A common feature of these molecules is that they undergo a change in fluorescence intensity or undergo a Stokes shift in excitation and/or emission optima when bound to β-sheet-rich aggregates (LeVine 1993). Molecules such as ThT, thioflavin S (ThS), and Congo red have become essential probes, finding a place in nearly every study of tau aggregation. For example, one important use of these probes is in high-throughput screening (HTS). Screening strategies typically follow a general workflow in which tau (or just the repeat region of tau) is incubated overnight with an inducer (e.g., heparin) and a probe (e.g., ThT). Molecules able to limit ThT fluorescence are then selected as aggregation inhibitors, as discussed in more detail below. It is important to note that these probes may not be mechanistically innocent bystanders in aggregation; recent reports associate ThTwith accelerated rates of fibrillization for amyloid-β and α-synuclein (Coelho-Cerqueira et al. 2014; Di Carlo et al. 2015).

What molecular features of tau fibrils are recognized by ThTand other probes? This question has been extensively studied in other amyloid systems (Reinke and Gestwicki 2011). For example, in the case of amyloid-β, Phe residues in the core of the β-sheet have been shown to make critical hydrophobic contacts with the probe (Biancalana et al. 2009). In the bound configuration, the reporter often lies perpendicular to the peptide chain and in line with the fiber axis (Klunk et al. 1994; Lockhart et al. 2005). For example, Congo red is proposed to span across five peptide chains based on the distances between the sulfonic groups (Klunk et al. 1989, 1994). In addition to this configuration, spectroscopic experiments have shown that amyloid fibrils have multiple, nonequivalent binding sites. Indeed, ThT has been shown to populate up to three different binding sites on amyloid-β fibrils (LeVine 2005; Lockhart et al. 2005). Two binding sites are thought to be populated with high density, occurring once every four to 35 monomers, and the last binding site is only predicted to occur once per approximately 300 monomers. Congo red shares one of ThT’s high density binding sites, but also has a weak discrete binding site of its own on the end of the fibril in an orientation parallel to the β-sheets (Ye et al. 2005). Although these studies with Congo red and ThT have revealed much about the structure of amyloid-β fibrils, there have not been many equivalent structural investigations of tau fibrils. This need is particularly pressing because tau appears to have unique structural features. For example, in the case of Orange G, hydrophobic interactions with the amyloid-β core sequence (KLVFFA) are necessary, whereas binding of the same molecule to tau is reliant on polar interactions with core Gln and Lys residues (VQIVYK) (Landau et al. 2011). Similarly, the Kuret group found that the electronic properties of ThT-inspired ligands are important for displacing ThS from tau fibrils (Cisek et al. 2012). Differences between amyloid-β and tau are also observed when oligomers are studied. For example, ThT/Congo red can bind amyloid-β oligomers but not small tau oligomers (Maezawa et al. 2008; Lasagna-Reeves et al. 2010). Again, it has been shown that aromatic residues in the amyloid-β sequence are critical for ThT oligomer binding (Wolfe et al. 2010). One group has exploited the polarity differences in the binding pocket to create conjugated oligothiophenes that become luminescent in the presence of amyloids. By altering the position of anionic groups on the oligothiophenes, these molecules can discriminate between tau and amyloid-β deposits (Klingstedt et al. 2015). Further work may develop these molecules into diagnostic agents that could be used to detect specific tau aggregates.

AGGREGATION INHIBITORS
The exact pathway by which neurons are lost in tauopathies is still poorly understood. However, there is a general consensus that protein aggregation is a major element of toxicity, and therefore tau aggregation inhibitors could have potential as drugs. Where should these molecules bind? ThT and Congo red, which by analogy to amyloid-β, likely bind in the side-chain grooves formed perpendicular to the peptide chains, are typically very poor tau aggregation inhibitors and in some cases can accelerate aggregation. This makes some sense in that the molecules are binding to fibrils that have already formed and are not interfering with the critical templating process. Rather, aggregation inhibitors that bind parallel to the peptides would be expected to directly disrupt templating. The challenge is that the highly polar local environment of the terminal tau peptide in its β-strand conformation is expected to be a difficult drug target. Some clues for better binding sites might come from studies on mutations and PTMs that impact tau aggregation. For example, mutations in the repeat regions of tau (G272V, P301L) have been shown to speed the nucleation reaction rate and lower the minimal concentration necessary to support aggregation (Chang et al. 2008). Such studies might point to strategic binding sites for small molecule inhibitors, although the lack of structural information on the tau oligomers has slowed progress.

In the absence of structure-based design, a number of laboratories have taken an unbiased HTS strategy. In these experiments, full-length tau or shorter tau fragments are assembled into fibrils in vitro, and compound collections are screened for inhibitors. Several platforms have been used, including ThT-based assays (as described above), filter assays to measure soluble versus insoluble tau, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to look at filament length/ amount, and fluorescence polarization (FP) assays using labeled tau (Pickhardt et al. 2005; Taniguchi et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2009; Crowe et al. 2009). Using these methods, more than 400 aggregation inhibitors have been reported. Most of these are planar heterocycles, such as aminothienopyridazines, quinoxalines, benzothiazoles, rhodanines, anthraquinones, porphyrins, phenylthiahydrazides, and N-phenylamines (Necula et al. 2005; Pickhardt et al. 2005, 2007a; Taniguchi et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2009; Crowe et al. 2007, 2009). In most cases, mechanistic studies are lacking and structure–activity relationships (SARs) are not available, so it is difficult to judge how the molecules are acting or whether they can be optimized beyond the screening “hit.” To make matters worse, a few of the reported molecules are likely to be competitive inhibitors of ThT or Congo red, potentially serving as false positives. Other molecules might be expected to block the activity of the accelerant (e.g., heparin), another type of artifact. However, some of these compounds may indeed recognize critical residues involved in tau self-assembly. Indeed, a few classes of inhibitors have been explored in more detail, revealing mechanisms of tau aggregation and its inhibition.

One of the first compounds identified was the phenothiazine, methylene blue (MB; methylthioninium chloride) (Wischik et al. 1996). This compound was shown to partially disrupt the structure of isolated PHFs, and subsequent studies showed that MB could prevent tau aggregation in vitro (Wischik et al 1996; Taniguchi et al. 2005). Treatment with MB or its analogs has also been shown to reduce tau-reactive neurons and reverse spatial and motor deficits in multiple transgenic mouse models (O’Leary et al. 2010; Congdon et al. 2012; Melis et al. 2015). A Phase II clinical trial of MB in mild/moderate AD has been completed, and MB was found to promote stabilization of AD over a period of 50 wk in some patients (Wischik et al. 2015). Currently, a Phase III clinical trial is under way with a stable, reduced version of MB, LMTX, and results should be available starting in 2016 (Wischik et al. 2014). MB is well known to be redox active, so it is not surprising that its ability to block aggregation involves oxidization of cysteine residues important for aggregation (Akoury et al. 2013; Crowe et al. 2013). Indeed, alanine mutations of Cys291 and Cys322 or the addition of reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol or glutathione, block MB’s antiaggregation activity (Akoury et al. 2013; Crowe et al. 2013). Because the MB drug levels measured during in vivo efficacy experiments are lower than the concentrations required to oxidize the key tau cysteines, it is not known whether this mechanism-of-action is relevant in vivo (Baddeley et al. 2015). The promiscuous nature of MB’s redox activity and the high concentration of glutathione in the liver add to the uncertainty. Recently, MB was shown to cause dissolution of PHFs isolated from AD brain tissue with a Ki (inhibition constant) consistent with both the trough brain concentrations observed in mouse efficacy studies and the most effective dose in the human Phase II clinical trial (Harrington et al. 2015). Regardless of the mechanism, this small molecule remains the most advanced of the known aggregation inhibitors.

Chemical modification of tau, as has been shown for MB, has been observed in other programs. For example, aminothienopyridazines (ATPZs) have been shown to oxidize cysteine residues on tau to prevent its aggregation (Crowe et al. 2013). Likewise, the natural product oleocanthal creates covalent adducts with lysine residues in tau. This modification prevents tau aggregation, presumably by neutralizing lysine-positive charges in the repeat domain (Li et al. 2009). None of these activities are likely to be specific for tau, complicating their use in cells or animals (at least as mechanistic probes). However, covalent binding is becoming an increasingly common approach in drug discovery (Mah et al. 2014; Bauer 2015), so there may be opportunities for taking advantage of this mechanism.

Polyphenols, including EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), myrectin, and tannic acid, have all been found to prevent tau aggregation with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the low to submicromolar range (Taniguchi et al. 2005; Yao et al. 2013). These molecules are “frequent hitters,” with notoriously promiscuous protein-binding properties. However, despite their severe disadvantages as therapeutics or probes in cells and animals, the polyphenols appear to be useful mechanistic tools in vitro. EGCG was hypothesized to prevent tau aggregation by binding misfolded monomers, thus preventing the conversion of tau into an aggregation-prone form (Wobst et al. 2015). Consistent with this idea, polyphenols are not effective at disaggregating pre-formed tau fibrils (Taniguchi et al. 2005). Caution should be used when interpreting studies using polyphenol-containing molecules. Catechols, catecholamines, and polyphenols are rapidly oxidized in solution to quinones. These species efficiently quench ThT fluorescence and are potentially false positives in many assays (Coelho-Cerqueira et al. 2014). Furthermore, some flavonoids, including myricetin, are believed to derive their promiscuous activity from their ability to form aggregates at micro-molar concentrations (Tritsch et al. 2015). If a more drug-like scaffold could access this type of chemical chaperone activity as proposed for EGCG, it could have powerful implications. In particular, such molecules might have a profound effect on tau prion conversion by limiting access to monomers. Such an approach was recently reported for α-synuclein and transthyretin (Bulawa et al. 2012; Tóth et al. 2014).

As mentioned previously, a number of other compounds have been reported as inhibitors of tau aggregation, and mechanistic and translational studies are underway. For example, benzofurazans such as TRV-1387 (Reed et al. 2015) are proposed to inhibit the aggregation of tau and amyloid-β as measured by ThS and ThT binding, respectively. Related molecules are reported to show a reduction of tau and amyloid-β oligomers in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (Treventis Corporation press release J 2015). Finally, Oligomerix described TO-330, a small molecule inhibitor of tau oligomerization; dose-response data show that TO-330 behaves similarly to MB. The structure has not been disclosed, and they propose to advance the series to hit optimization (Moe 2013).

TAU FIBRIL REMODELING
Numerous compounds have been reported to remodel tau fibrils. For example, the Mandel-kow group performed a HTS screen of 200,000 compounds using both inhibition of tau aggregation and disassembly of tau aggregates as criteria for hit selection (Pickhardt et al. 2005). In some of these cases, medicinal chemistry campaigns have produced informative SARs and advanced the potency of the compounds (Bulic et al. 2007; Larbig et al. 2007; Pickhardt et al. 2007a,b). For a number of these chemical series, hydrogen bonds seemed to play a predominant role, where preference for nitro groups, carboxylic acids, phenols, and sulfonamides are enriched. In the case of the rhodanine-based inhibitors, SAR-driven optimization led to submicromolar potencies for both aggregation inhibition and disassembly and importantly showed reduced toxicity in a N2a cell model (Fig. 2) (Bulic et al. 2007). Furthermore, this molecule (bb14) was shown to be active in a Caenorhabditis elegans model (Fatouros et al. 2012) and in organotypic slice culture models (Messing et al. 2013). Despite these advances, a detailed mechanistic understanding of how these molecules and other fibril remodelers interact with tau is still lacking. For one class of molecules (phenylthiazolyhydrazides), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments showed that the molecule binds to the repeat regions of tau (Pickhardt et al. 2007a), suggesting that it might directly compete with self-assembly. Other small molecules, such as the benzothiazole N744, seem to inhibit tau filament extension but not nucleation (Chirita and Kuret 2004; Necula et al. 2005). Interestingly, this compound and certain other dye-like molecules form aggregates at higher concentrations that enhance tau fibrillization (Congdon et al. 2007). However, such compounds provide another novel mechanism for future exploration.

Small oligomers of tau appear to pose the highest neurotoxic threat (Lasagna-Reeves et al. 2011). Therefore, compounds that remodel tau fibrils into smaller oligomers may be less helpful than originally thought. For example, porphyrins and cyanines have both been shown to stabilize SDS-soluble, oligomeric tau (Akoury et al. 2013; Schafer et al. 2013). Although the toxicity of these structures is still unclear, some insights might be gained from studies on other amyloid-prone proteins, such as Sup35. Specifically, it has been shown that small molecules can promote specific Sup35 conformers, leading to strain resistance and necessitating multiple drug combinations for eradication (Roberts et al. 2009).

PET PROBES
Clinical diagnosis of tauopathies is currently hindered by the lack of definitive diagnostic methods to detect NFTs in living subjects. Molecular imaging tools, such as positron emission tomography (PET), hold promise as a way to detect disease. Three different PET tracers are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to detect amyloid-β deposits (Amyvid; florbetapir F-18, Vizamyl; flutametamol F-18, Neuaceg; florbetaben F18). Likewise, at least seven tau pathology PET tracers are under development: C-11 PBB3, F-18 THK-523, F-18 THK-5105, F-18 THK-5117, F-18 FDDNP, F-18 T807 (now AV1451), and F-18 T808 (Fig. 3) (Agdeppa et al. 2001; Fodero-Tavoletti et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012; Maruyama et al. 2013; Okamura et al. 2013; Xia et al. 2013). Not all of these agents are specific for tau. For instance, F-18 FDDNP binds to both amyloid-β and tau pathologies with relatively weak affinity (Thompson et al. 2009). THK-523 has affinity for tau lesions only in AD brains, but not tau lesions from other tauopathies (Fodero-Tavoletti et al. 2014). Further, this tracer also displayed elevated white matter binding, making it unsuitable for future clinical settings (Villemagne et al. 2014). The failure of THK-523, however, led to the development of THK-5105 and THK-5117, which have both shown to have greater specificity for tau as well as better toxicity profiles (Okamura et al. 2013). Clinical studies on these molecules are ongoing.

The benzoimidazopyrimidines T808 and T807/AV1451 and the benzothiazole PBB3 also have promise for the imaging of tau. T807/AV1451 is currently in Phase II development and has shown a 29-fold preference for tau aggregates over amyloid-β (Chien et al. 2013). In addition, T807 and T808 molecules displayed rapid brain uptake followed by a rapid washout in normal mice, suggesting low nonspecific binding (Zhang et al. 2012; Xia et al. 2013). In patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD subjects, a distinct pattern of tracer uptake was observed relative to the cerebellum, mirroring the current understanding of tau deposition as described by Braak and Braak (Chien et al. 2013, 2014). Despite these exciting advances, little is known about where these probes bind or why they have selectivity for tau pathology versus other amyloids.

FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
Tau aggregation is an established marker and potential mediator of neurodegenerative tauopathies. Small molecules that bind to tau have taught us many lessons about the aggregation process, as well as helped us to delineate potential means of therapy. However, our knowledge is far from complete. What specific regions of tau do these molecules bind, and do they force any structural constraints on tau itself? Do they bind tau before or after aggregation? With this understanding, we may gain insight into how to specifically target tau.

Interestingly, a majority of tau inhibitors have been discovered in HTS efforts using just the repeat regions of tau and without any PTMs or disease-associated mutations. Indeed, it is known that phosphorylation and mutation play a key role in aggregation kinetics (Chang et al. 2011; Combs and Gamblin 2012), suggesting that some molecules may be more or less effective at preventing their aggregation. We suggest that future efforts might better integrate knowledge of disease-associated variations to focus small molecule discovery campaigns.

One of the largest, untapped areas of discovery involves the realization that tau, and many other amyloid-prone proteins, have features in common with prions. Specifically, tau is able to pass from cell to cell and spread the aggregated form. These are paradigm-shifting observations, from the point of view of small molecule discovery. What effect do small molecules have on tau prion formation, clearance, or conversion? Can the process of prion templating provide an entirely new source of drug targets? One can speculate that a small molecule might bind to tau and alter the energetic landscape to raise the barriers between tau prion formation and/ or the infection of other tau monomers. In addition, one can envision that small molecules might bind to tau prions in the extracellular space to block their entry into adjacent cells or otherwise alter their ability to spread. Further, small molecules might bind tau prions inside of cells and either accelerate their turnover or change their trafficking. Any of these (wildly speculative) mechanisms might create new opportunities for discovery. A key will be to design HTS campaigns to take into account this emerging biology and to continue the development of sensitive chemical probes for studying this process.

Finally, the development of small molecules that bind to tau is severely hindered by a lack of structural information. NMR is a powerful way to study tau monomers in solution (Mukrasch et al. 2009) and electron microscopy (EM) has begun to show the structures of fibrils (Combs and Gamblin 2012), yet we still have little understanding of how tau prions or oligomers form or what they look like. Because of the heterogeneity of tau aggregates, classical structural methods have difficulty uncovering the nature of these structures. To unlock the full potential of modern structure-based drug discovery, we must better understand the binding sites and the relationships between these sites and the structural dynamics of tau.

Small molecules will continue to be one important tool in the arsenal for studying tau. These compounds can report on tau aggregation in vitro and in vivo. They can also be used to study the requirements for tau aggregation in more detail, as revealed by the compounds that oxidize tau’s cysteines. Finally, these compounds might be the starting point for therapies that act directly on tau aggregation, the key physical event that is linked to disease.
