Alzheimer’s dementia is the leading cause of dementia in older adults and women are disproportionately burdened. It is increasingly recognized that dementia in older persons is related to the co-occurrence of mixed pathologies in the brain, but few studies have examined whether the frequency of common pathologies vary by sex. We examined the frequency of the most common mixed pathologies that underlie Alzheimer’s dementia in aging, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in combination with Lewy Bodies, cerebrovascular disease (CVD) pathology, or TDP-43/Hippocampal sclerosis, and determined whether the patterns differed for women and men in a combined cohort of over 1500 older community-dwelling adults. We found in separate models that women were significantly more likely to have AD and CVD pathology than men, and men were more likely to have “pure” Lewy Body disease, in models adjusted for age at death, education, race, and the APOE-e4 allele. Although AD with TDP-43/Hippocampal sclerosis pathology was greater in number in women than men, the difference was not significant after adjustments for age at death and other confounders. Together these findings suggest sex differences in mixed pathology, specifically AD with CVD in older adults from the community.


1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s dementia is the leading cause of dementia in older adults. Of the approximately 5.2 million people over age 65 with Alzheimer’s in the United States, 60% are women (Hebert et al, 2013). Studies of incidence of Alzheimer’s Dementia have been equivocal, however, with some studies reporting that women have a higher incidence of AD and others reporting either no difference or a higher incidence in men (Hebert et al., 2001; Barnes et al., 2003; see Mielke et al., 2014 for review). Reasons for the discrepant results are unclear. Although women tend to live longer than men, on average, the disparity is not simply attributable to a longer life expectancy (Hebert et al., 2001; Nebel et al., 2018). Furthermore, studies differ widely in methodology, sample sizes and covariates that are considered (Mielke et al., 2014) making a consistent narrative relating sex differences and AD difficult to discern, and relatively few studies have examined sex/gender differences in the underlying neuropathology of dementia (Corder et al., 2004; Miller, Hicks, D'Amato, &amp; Landis, 1984; Sandberg, Stewart, Smialek, &amp; Troncoso, 2001; Nelson et al., 2010; Filon et al., 2016; Shinohara et al., 2016).

More than a decade ago, we examined sex differences in the pathologic indices of Alzheimer’s dementia and whether the relation between AD pathology and clinical status differed for men and women in the Religious Orders Study (ROS; Barnes et al., 2005). We found that women had more global AD pathology than men, due primarily to more neurofibrillary tangles, a finding that has since been extended using greater numbers (Oveisgharan et al., 2018) and replicated in other cohorts (Filon et al., 2016; Liesinger et al., 2018). We also found in the original 2005 study that the association between AD pathology and clinical AD was substantially stronger in women than in men. Each additional unit of AD pathology was associated with a nearly 3-fold increase in the odds of clinical AD in men compared with a more than 20-fold increase in the odds in women (Barnes et al., 2005).

Owing to advances in our understanding of the neurobiologic substrates of dementia, it is becoming increasingly recognized that dementia in older persons is related not only to Alzheimer’s disease pathology, but also vascular pathologies, and other neurodegenerative disease pathologies including Lewy Body disease, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) (Kapasi, DeCarli, &amp; Schneider, 2017). Further, persons with dementia often have multiple co-morbid pathologies in the brain as a cause of dementia, and the patterns can be quite varied from person to person (Boyle et al., 2018; James et al., 2016). Recent data from the Rush cohorts demonstrate that over 85% of those with MCI and over 95% of those with probable AD have mixed pathologies (Kapasi et al., 2017). Given sex differences in the individual pathologies that cause dementia, with women having more AD pathology (Barnes et al., 2005; Oveisgharan et al., 2018) and men having more Lewy Body pathology (Nelson et al., 2010), the extent to which there may be sex differences in mixed pathology in older adults is an interesting question that has not been systematically investigated to our knowledge.

In this paper, we examine the frequency of the most common mixed pathologies that underlie AD dementia in aging, specifically Alzheimer’s disease in combination with Lewy Bodies, cerebrovascular disease (CVD) pathologies, or TDP/Hippocampal sclerosis and determine whether the frequencies differ across sex in over 1500 community-dwelling older adults both with and without dementia. We also investigated “pure” Lewy body disease (Lewy body disease without a pathologic diagnosis of AD) since this has also been previously noted to be more common in men (Nelson et. al., 2010). Participants were enrolled at baseline without dementia and followed until death in one of four longitudinal, epidemiologic studies at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center.

2. Results

Table 1 lists the sample characteristics. Women were, on average, slightly older at baseline and about two years older at death than men (both p’s&lt;.001). But men had more years of education (p&lt;001). The sample was 93.7% non-Latino White, with no difference in distribution of race across sex. There were also no sex differences in APOE carriership or cognitive status at death. Approximately 26% of both women and men had at least one Apolipoprotein-ε4 allele (APOE-ε4). One third of both men and women died with no cognitive impairment. About one fifth of both women and men had MCI (women = 20.9%; men = 22.7%) and slightly over one third of each sex had a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia (women = 38.7%; men = 34.1%). Women tended to have slightly longer follow-up time in study (7.8 vs. 7.2 years), and a longer interval between the last clinical evaluation and death by about three months (p&lt;.01) compared with men.

Table 2 shows the frequency distribution of mixed pathologies and Parkinson’s pathologies by sex. Women were more likely to have AD with advanced TDP/HS pathology than men (women=27.0%; men=19.9%; p&lt;0.01), and men were more likely to have pure Lewy body disease than women (women=6.4%; men=9.5%; p&lt;0.05). There were trends in the data that suggested women were more likely to have AD with CVD, and men were more likely to have Parkinson’s pathology, but neither reached significance. There was no difference across sex in the frequency distribution of AD with Lewy body pathology.

Because accumulation of mixed neuropathology is strongly associated with age (e.g., Middleton et al., 2011), we examined the patterns of mixed pathology stratified by age at death (&lt;85 vs. &gt;85 years). Each pathology was more frequent at older ages. As shown in Table 3, this pattern was observed for every pathology in women and men, except for pure Lewy Body disease, and appeared less pronounced among women for Parkinson’s pathology.

The most common mixed co-morbid pathology with AD was CVD in both women (66.9%) and men (57.4%). Upon further examination of the possible combinations of AD and CVD pathology, we found the largest sex difference for AD with CVD and CVD alone (Figure 1).

Next, we conducted logistic regression models and obtained the ratio of the odds of mixed pathology in women relative to men. All models adjusted for age at death, education, race, and the presence of one or more ε4 alleles. As shown in Table 4, and consistent with bivariate associations, men were less likely to have AD with CVD pathology compared with women. No other mixed pathologies were different between men and women. In contrast, men were more likely to have “pure” Lewy body disease and Parkinson’s disease pathology compared with women. In models that stratified age at death (&lt;85 years vs. &gt;85 years), older age at death was associated with greater odds of AD with TDP/HS, AD_CVD, AD_LB, and Parkinson’s disease pathology (all p’s &lt;.05). Only pure Lewy Body disease did not correlate with age at death (p=0.11). In subsequent full models that tested whether the associations were different in men vs women, there were no interactions of age at death by sex suggesting similar patterns of pathology distribution by age in men and women.

3. Discussion

We examined sex differences in the frequency of mixed pathologies in over 1500 older community-dwelling adults enrolled in one of four Rush cohort studies: the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Minority Aging Research Study, and the Rush Clinical Core. We found that mixed pathologies consisting of AD with CVD pathology, Lewy Body pathology, or TDP/HS were common in both women and men. However, AD with CVD pathology, including gross and micro-infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, was the most common combination with more than half of both women and men having these co-morbid pathologies. Further, women were significantly more likely to have AD and CVD pathology than men in models adjusted for age at death, education, race, and the Apoe ε4. Together, these findings suggest sex differences in mixed pathology, specifically AD and CVD. By contrast, though AD with TDP pathology was greater in number in women, this was not significant after controlling for age at death and other possible confounders.

Sex differences in Alzheimer’s dementia have been long debated, and results from longitudinal epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent further complicating the story (Mielke et al., 2016). Relative to the large neuropathological literature on AD, few neuropathologic studies, particularly from community-dwelling participants, have systematically addressed this question (Barnes et al., 2005; Corder et al., 2004; Miller, Hicks, D'Amato, &amp; Landis, 1984; Sandberg, Stewart, Smialek, &amp; Troncoso, 2001; Nelson et al., 2010; Filon et al., 2016; Shinohara et al., 2016; Oveisgharan et al., 2018), and no one to our knowledge, has examined sex differences in the patterns or frequency of mixed pathologies. Our finding that AD with CVD pathology is significantly more common in women is consistent with the fact that women have greater AD pathology (Barnes et al., 2005; Oveisgharan et al., 2018), but is intriguing given other AD mixed pathologies were not higher in women, and that the age-adjusted CVD morbidity rates are typically higher in men than in women (Sandberg &amp; Ji, 2012; Habermen, Capildeo, &amp; Rose, 1981). In our sample, we did not see dramatic differences in vascular risk factors between women and men, although in a recent report on decedents from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Oveisgharan et al., 2018), the authors found that women had more severe arteriolosclerosis, even after adjusting for age at death, vascular risk factors and vascular diseases. Perhaps women have more subclinical vascular risk factors than men (Michos et al., 2005; Roy et al., 2015), which might allow for less dramatic consequences of disease; i.e., small vessel disease versus frank stroke or myocardial infarction. Whether the sex difference in AD and CVD pathology is due to more severe arteriolosclerosis in women will need to be investigated in future research.

One prior cross-sectional, retrospective study of decedents from a regional brain bank found sex differences in the frequency of AD pathology when stratified by age at death (e.g., Liesinger et al., 2018), such that AD pathology was more common among men in the 7th decade and women were over-represented in later decades. In the current study, there was no sex by age at death interaction for any of the pathologies; but the age at death was much higher. Additionally, the current study had little representation at ages at death below 70 years, and our focus was on mixed pathologies, not just AD pathology. Future studies with a wider range of ages at death are needed to address these conflicting results regarding whether the distribution of mixed pathologies differ by age for men and women.

We also found that men were significantly more likely to have “pure” Lewy Body disease. While a sex difference for Parkinson’s disease has been well-documented in clinical studies (Gillies, Pienaar, Vohra, &amp; Qamhawi, 2014; Savica et al., 2013), sex differences in Dementia with Lewy Bodies from neuropathologic studies has been mixed (Mouton et al., 2018). But few large scale studies have been conducted to examine this relatively rare neuropathology, and most studies tend to rely on clinical criteria for Dementia with Lewy Bodies diagnoses, rather than neuropathological criteria. Our results are consistent with a large multicenter autopsy series that demonstrated an association between male sex and pure cortical Lewy Body pathology (Nelson et al., 2010) and provide further evidence that supports the clinical finding of greater Dementia with Lewy Bodies among men. Because persons with Dementia with Lewy Bodies but less AD are more likely to have the Dementia with Lewy Bodies clinical syndrome (McKeith et al., 2017), our data support the clinical studies that report a sex difference in Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the much more common AD mixed with Lewy body pathology is equally common in men and women.

Our study has several strengths. First, we extended our original examination in the ROS cohort more than a decade ago, with more than ten times the amount of autopsies in several additional Rush cohort studies of individuals from the community, all of whom began the study without dementia and were followed to death. This increases the generalizability of our study over the typical clinic-based study or autopsy series from brain banks. Second, all four cohorts used harmonized uniform and structured clinical and neuropathological evaluations, and the neuropathological evaluations were conducted blinded to clinical data. Finally, all of the cohort studies have high rates of follow-up (&gt; 90% on average) and impressive autopsy rates, decreasing selection bias due to attrition before autopsy.

Limitations include a relatively homogeneous sample of primarily non-Latino Whites. Although we had close to 100 autopsies from racial and ethnic groups, the study lacked power to examine the intersection of sex and race on the frequency of mixed pathology. Also, we collapsed the co-morbid pathologies into 3 main categories. Although CVD, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and TDP-43 are the most common non AD neuropathologies to cause dementia, creating more fine grain combinations, particularly for CVD pathology, may have yielded different results by sex.

In summary we found that AD mixed with CVD is more common in women even after accounting for age and conversely “pure” DLB pathology is more common in men. Overall, these new data extend our current understanding of sex differences in dementia related neuropathologies to specific types of mixed and “pure” pathologies. It will be important to continue to study the biological underpinnings and public health impact of sex differences in mixed AD/vascular, and pure Lewy body pathologies in future studies.

4. Experimental Procedure

4a. Participants

Clinical and neuropathological data come from autopsied participants who were enrolled in one of four clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging: the Religious Orders Study (Bennett et al., 2018), the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Bennett et al., 2018), the Minority Aging Research Study (Barnes et al., 2012), and the Rush Clinical Core (Schneider et al., 2009). Participants in the Religious Orders Study are older Catholic nuns, priests and brothers from across the USA who have been followed since 1994. The Rush Memory and Aging Project started in 1997 and consists of older lay persons who are recruited from retirement communities and subsidized housing facilities across the Chicago metropolitan area. The Minority Aging Research Study and the Rush Clinical Core both consist of older African Americans recruited from churches, senior buildings and social clubs and organizations that cater to minority populations. All four studies recruit participants without known dementia at baseline who agreed to annual clinical evaluations and participants in both the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project agree to organ donation at the time of death; organ donation is not required as a condition of entry in either the Minority Aging Research Study or Clinical Core, but is actively pursued with extensive education and outreach. All four studies have a rolling admission with new participants recruited each year and evaluated annually with the same clinical evaluation until death (or withdrawal from the study). All participants signed an informed consent and an Anatomical Gift Act form for those agreeing to organ donation. The studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. Currently, more than 4700 participants have enrolled across all the studies, and follow-up is high for a community study, ranging between 85 and 90% of survivors. Across all four studies to date, 2067 have died (including deaths in the two minority studies where organ donation is not required), and 2712 are alive and still being followed longitudinally. Of the 2067 deaths, 1632 participants underwent autopsy, and neuropathological data were available on 1578 participants at the time of the current analysis.

4b. Clinical evaluation

Participants in all studies underwent structured, uniform clinical evaluations that included a medical history, neurologic examination, and neuropsychological test performance (Bennett et al., 2018; Barnes et al., 2012). Determination of AD dementia followed a multi-step process. The diagnosis was based on the criteria of the joint working group of the NINDS and AD/ADRD (McKhann et al., 2011) and required a history of cognitive decline and evidence of impairment in episodic memory and at least one additional cognitive domain. MCI referred to those participants who were rated as impaired by the neuropsychologist on cognitive testing but did not meet criteria for dementia. At the time of death, all available clinical data were reviewed by a clinician and a summary diagnostic opinion was rendered regarding the most likely clinical diagnosis at the time of death.

4c. Pathologic evaluation

Brains of deceased participants were removed, weighed, and cut into 1 cm coronal slabs and underwent complete macroscopic evaluation as previously described (Nag et al., 2017). Brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer. Blocks were dissected from 11 brain regions including: midfrontal, middle temporal, inferior parietal, anterior cingulate, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, and midbrain with substantia nigra, and embedded in paraffin. Neuropathological diagnoses were made by a board-certified neuropathologist blinded to age and clinical data, as previously described (Schneider et al., 2009).

Alzheimer’s disease:

A modified Bielschowsky silver stain was used to visualize neuritic and neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal, temporal, parietal, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices (Schneider et al., 2004). The neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease was made based on National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan criteria (1997) using semi-quantitative estimates of neuritic plaque density as recommended by Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD; Mirra et al., 1991), modified to be implemented without adjustment for age and clinical diagnosis, and modified Braak stage for neurofibrillary tangles severity (Braak and Braak, 1991), as previously described (Schneider et al., 2009). A diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease required an ‘intermediate likelihood Alzheimer’s disease,’ or ‘high likelihood Alzheimer’s disease’ by NIA-Reagan criteria: at least intermediate stage Braak (i.e. Braak III/IV) and at least moderate neocortical neuritic plaques (CERAD probable Alzheimer’s disease) (Bennett et al., 2006). Pathologic absence of a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease included subjects with no Alzheimer’s disease and low likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease by NIA-Reagan criteria.

Cerebrovascular pathologies:

Cerebral infarcts visible to the naked eye (macroscopic infarcts) were recorded (Schneider et al., 2004); only chronic macroscopic infarcts (estimated as older than 3 to 6 months) were included in the present analysis. Lacunar infarcts were defined as gross infarcts in the white or deep grey matter, and were 10 mm or less in diameter. Microscopic infarcts were recorded from haematoxylin and eosin stained 6 -mm paraffin-embedded sections from at least nine regions (Arvanitakis et al., 2011). A dichotomous summary diagnosis of infarcts (the presence of any chronic macroscopic and/or microscopic infarctions versus the absence of both types) was created for these analyses. Small vessel disease, or arteriolosclerosis, was evaluated on histological examination, on haematoxylin and eosin stained sections of the anterior basal ganglia (Buchman et al., 2011). Severity of this pathology was graded semi-quantitatively based on concentric hyaline thickening of vessel walls with emphasis placed on evaluation of smaller arterioles, less than 50 microns (Arvanitakis et al., 2016). Atherosclerosis was assessed through evaluation of circle of Willis vessels (Arvanitakis et al., 2016). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was examined using Aβ immunostaining of meningeal and parenchymal vessels in four regions. A semi-quantitatively scoring system as none, mild, moderate, and severe was used for the assessment of atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and CAA (Boy.le et al., 2015). For these analyses, severity of arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and CAA was dichotomized into moderate/severe versus not present/mild.

Lewy Body pathology:

Immunohistochemistry with alpha-synuclein (Zymed LB 509; 1:50; pSyn, 1:20 000; Wako Chemicals) was used to detect Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra, entorhinal, cingulate, midfrontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortex (Schneider et al., 2007). Criteria for Lewy body disease used a modified version of the Consensus guidelines for a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (McKeith et al., 2005; Schneider et al., 2007). A dichotomous summary diagnosis of Lewy body disease, present or absent, was used for these analyses, as previously described (James et al., 2016). Neocortical Lewy bodies were required. Of note, pure Lewy body pathology for these studies was defined at neocortical Lewy body pathology in the absence of a pathologic diagnosis of AD. A pathological diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease was confirmed if there was any Lewy Body pathology, and moderate or greater nigral neuron loss, as previously described (Buchman et al., 2019; Sohail et al., 2017).

TDP-43 inclusions:

TDP-43 pathology was investigated in six brain regions as previously described (Wilson et al., 2013): the amygdala (and periamygdalar region, when available), hippocampus CA1/subiculum, hippocampus dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, midfrontal cortex, and middle temporal cortex. Immunostaining was done on 6-mm sections using monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated TDP-43 (pS409/410; 1:100, Ascenion) (Neumann et al., 2009). Each region of interest was reviewed for presence and location of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions, and severity was rated on a 6-point scale based on the number of inclusions in a 0.25 mm2 area of greatest density within that region as described previously (Wilson et al., 2013). A dichotomous variable of TDP-43 positivity was created based on the presence of TDP-43 pathology (one or more inclusions) extending beyond the amygdala

Hippocampal sclerosis:

Hippocampal sclerosis was evaluated unilaterally in a coronal section of the mid-hippocampus at the level of the lateral geniculate body, and was graded as absent or present based on severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the CA1and/or subiculum, as previously described (Nag et al., 2015).

4d. Available clinical data

Race and ethnicity were self-reported based on the 1990 US Census categories. Years of education was ascertained and clinical interval was calculated as the number of months between the last clinical evaluation and autopsy. The presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele was determined.

4e. Statistical Approach

Participants from each of the cohorts were combined into a single statistical cohort for analyses. We first describe the demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics of participants. Then descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to characterize differences between female and male decedents. Next, we calculated the frequency of mixed pathology for the following combinations: AD pathology and cerebrovascular pathology, AD pathology and Lewy Body pathology, AD pathology and TDP/HS. We also examined sex differences in the frequency of Parkinson’s disease pathology and Lewy Body pathology without Alzheimer’s pathology. Finally, these distributions were examined in logistic regression models with mixed pathology as the outcome, adjusted for demographic characteristics and the presence of an APOE-ε4 allele.
