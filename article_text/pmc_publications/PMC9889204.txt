Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options and considerable diagnostic challenges. Identification and validation of retinal changes that correlate with clinicopathologic features of AD could provide a non-invasive method of screening and monitoring progression of disease, with notable implications for developing new therapies, particularly in its preclinical stages. Retinal biomarkers that have been studied to date include structural changes in neurosensory retinal layers, alterations in vascular architecture and function, and pathologic deposition of proteins within the retina, which have all demonstrated variable correlation with the presence of preclinical or clinical AD. Evolution of specialized retinal imaging modalities and advances in artificial intelligence hold great promise for future study in this burgeoning field. The current status of research in retinal biomarkers, and some of the challenges that will need to be addressed in future work, are reviewed herein.


pmcIntroduction

Dementia is a significant cause of morbidity worldwide, afflicting 55 million people globally, and expected to increase in population to 78 million in the next decade. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia1, and manifests as a slowly progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disease that is defined by specific histopathologic changes in brain tissue2. AD is now the sixth leading cause of death in the United States3. Current benchmarks for diagnosis of dementia and AD are inadequate, and the majority of cases of dementia remain undiagnosed4. The gold standard of diagnosis for AD remains neuropathologic examination of brain tissue. Post-mortem analyses have shown up to a 30% rate of misdiagnosis. Over the last decade, noninvasive imaging of cerebral amyloid using positron emission tomography (PET) and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers have been established as valid biomarkers for pathologic states of cerebral amyloid deposition5. Nonetheless, current diagnostic metrics are limited by poor sensitivity and specificity6, lack of standardization and scalability, insufficient access to specialized imaging equipment and subspecialty expertise, and cost, to name just a few barriers1.

In spite of the profound burden of disease both to individuals and to society, treatment options for AD have been sparse, with historically approved pharmacological agents directed towards symptomatic management only. Disappointing clinical trial results over the last two decades have hindered attempts at bringing therapy that can alter disease progression to market. In June 2021, the first disease modifying pharmacological therapy, aducanumab, was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in spite of equivocal clinical benefit in phase three clinical trials7. Aducanumab is an antibody against amyloid-β peptide, a hallmark pathologic feature of AD, and was shown to decrease amyloid-β burden as a surrogate for clinical efficacy. A post approval randomized trial to directly demonstrate effects on clinical endpoints is pending, but results will likely not be available for many years.

The controversy of adacanumab’s approval underscores multiple facets of the need for validated biomarkers in AD at different stages of disease. The pathological changes of AD are thought to begin decades before the manifestation of cognitive changes, accompanying a stage of disease that has been termed the “preclinical phase”8. With clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment, the spectrum of AD progresses from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to frank AD dementia. MCI carries nearly a 50% chance of converting to AD within 30 months9, and the preclinical phase represents a window of opportunity to intervene before disease is clinically manifested10. Interest in identifying new biomarkers for preclinical and clinical disease is motivated not just by the need for improved diagnostic access and accuracy, but also by the dire need for metrics by which to identify and recruit patients for clinical trials designed to modify disease progression at early stages, as well as endpoints to assess the efficacy of potential therapeutic regimens.

Hypothesis for identifying retinal biomarkers

Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by abnormal extracellular deposition of misfolded amyloid-β protein as amyloid plaques and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins as neurofibrillary tangles in the central nervous system, affecting the neurovascular unit and resulting in progressive loss of cognitive function. The downstream effect of these abnormal proteins, and how it results in neurodegeneration, is multifactorial and complex, with microvascular changes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and loss of neural tissue all implicated in the continuum of disease11–12. Given that the neurosensory retina is an extension of the central nervous system, the possibility of seeing manifestations of AD directly in the eye is a reasonable hypothesis that has prompted the study of retinal biomarkers over the last decade.

Early histopathologic evidence of changes in retinal tissue in AD was demonstrated in postmortem studies in 1990, which showed axonal degeneration in 80% of optic nerves, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), and attenuation of retinal neural fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in AD patients compared to age matched controls, with predominant loss of M-type retinal ganglion cells (Figure 1)13–15. The authors posited that studying the retina and optic nerve might be valuable for better diagnostic and pathophysiologic understanding of AD. A proof of principle for using retinal imaging to identify AD came shortly thereafter, in which red-free fundus photography demonstrated RNFL defects in five of 22 patients with AD compared to only one of 24 age matched controls, and furthermore found a trend between increased optic nerve pallor and functional deficits as measured by the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale.16

Since these initial studies, evolution of retinal imaging technology and computational advances have driven the study of different retinal biomarkers to correlate with presence of preclinical or clinical AD, in a search for fast, noninvasive and accurate ways to identify disease. (Figure 2a) In parallel, the biochemical mechanisms underlying retinal pathology in AD continue to be elucidated, and are described well in recent publications17. This review will summarize the major recent advances by categories of biomarkers.

Evidence for retinal biomarkers

1. RNFL thickness

Peripapillary and macular RNFL thickness in AD has been the most extensively studied retinal biomarker in AD, with the preponderance of data supporting a correlation between decreased thickness in the presence of clinical AD. The first report of in in vivo application was in 2006, in which clinical exam and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) evaluation of optic nerve fibers found a greater odds ratio for large cup-to-disc ratio in patients with AD, albeit with low sensitivity and specificity (45% and 84% respectively)18.

Spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) analysis of peripapillary and macular RNFL thickness emerged at the same time with a similarly sized study of 28 AD and 30 age-matched control eyes, and found that RNFL thickness in all quadrants of AD patients were thinner than control. (Figure 2c) This study further correlated decreased total macular volume with lower mini-mental state examination scores, suggesting a relationship between RNFL thickness and severity of cognitive impairment19. Since this initial OCT study, the majority of studies have found RNFL thickness in AD to be decreased on OCT, albeit with some discrepancies surrounding the topographic distribution of thinning. A meta-analysis of 24 studies that measured RNFL thickness in AD using SD-OCT found a significant reduction in mean peripapillary RNFL thickness20 in AD compared to controls.

The relationship between RNFL thickness in preclinical AD or MCI is more nuanced and less clear. A meta-analysis of 6 studies showed an overall trend of RNFL thinning in MCI patients, but the correlation was not statistically significant21, with some reports showing no change22–23 or paradoxical thickening24 in MCI vs control. One hypothesis for the observation of paradoxical thickening is that gliosis precedes neuronal loss and atrophy, as seen with AD histopathology findings in the brain25, thus the temporal changes in RNFL thickness in the years preceding manifest AD dementia is likely a more complex story than a simple linear relationship. Adaptive optics SLO might have a role in delineating the presence of gliosis to further elucidate the relationship between RNFL thickness in preclinical AD26.

Functional implications of RNFL thinning have been studied as a clinical endpoint of interest. Prospective population studies have shown a relationship between RNFL thinning and future risk of cognitive decline. The UK Biobank study found that thinner baseline RNFL measurements were associated with worse performance on baseline cognitive testing, and that the two thinnest quintiles were twice as likely to perform more poorly on cognitive testing at 3 year follow up compared to patients in the thickest RNFL quintile27. The Rotterdam study, evaluating the relationship between RNFL thickness and incident versus prevalent dementia in a Dutch population found that thinner RNFL at baseline was associated with a significant increased risk of developing AD, but interestingly did not find any association with RNFL thinning and prevalent dementia28. A third prospective study in Shanghai of preclinical and MCI patients found that greater reduction in RNFL thickness over a 25 month period was associated with deterioration of cognitive status29. A recent study of retinal structural changes in preclinical patients with in vivo AD biomarkers demonstrated a reduced RNFL thickness in cognitively normal patients with positive amyloid-PET/CT (amyloid-labeled C-PiB positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging) compared to those with normal PET/CT30. Taken together, these studies suggest that RNFL thinning might potentially be useful as an early screening tool for incident development of dementia, and cautions against interpretation of associations seen in small cross sectional studies in determining the utility of this biomarker as a diagnostic tool.

However, if the intuition behind RNFL thinning serving as a biomarker for AD is that the neurosensory retina serves as a window for central nervous system degeneration in dementia, then it is important to note that RNFL thinning has been found in other neurodegenerative diseases as well and is likely not specific to AD31,32. Larger studies encompassing different causes of dementia will need to be performed to understand the role of RNFL thickness as a specific biomarker of AD vs any neurodegenerative conditions and the timeline in which the biomarker may be sensitive and/or specific for each condition.

2. Inner retinal layer and total macular thickness

In addition to RNFL thickness, other retinal layers have been studied as potential structural biomarkers in AD. The thickness of 10 retinal layers in 150 patient with AD were compared to age-matched controls, and correlations were found between the presence of AD and reduced thickness of RNFL, ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Longer AD duration was correlated with greater thinning of RNFL, GCL and IPL33.

Some subsequent studies have shown decreased macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) thickness on OCT be more sensitive for identifying AD compared to RNFL thickness (Figure 2b). The Rotterdam study, for example, evaluated GC-IPL thickness in addition to RNFL thickness, and found that thinner GC-IPL was associated with the presence of dementia while this trend was not observed in the same patients for RNFL thickness18. For patients with either MCI or AD, macular GC-IPL thickness was found to be decreased compared to control, with greater area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) for GC-IPL than RNFL34 thickness. Furthermore, there is some suggestion that analyzing the spatial distribution of GC-IPL thickness might be different in patients with MCI compared to AD, which might provide insight into the progression of disease.35

As a preclinical marker, however, no association was found between GC-IPL thickness and increased risk of incident dementia (HR 1.13, CI [0.9–1.43]) in the Rotterdam study (in contrast to RNFL thickness as previously discussed)18. Nonetheless, GC-IPL thinning has been associated with the prevalence of MCI in a meta-analysis21, has been shown to be more sensitive than RNFL thickness in detecting MCI in patient with positive in vivo biomarkers for AD36, and has recently been associated with cognitively normal patients with AD-related neurodegeneration30. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the positive structural and negative functional findings is the temporal lag between onset of dementia and the manifestation of GC-IPL thinning. The role for GC-IPL thickness as a biomarker in prodromal disease needs to be better defined.

Total macular thickness measurements have similarly been reported to be decreased in patients with MCI, AD20, and preclinical disease with positive in vivo biomarkers30. However, some studies have demonstrated only weak correlations between macular thickness in AD versus control populations, and predominantly in specific regions of the macula. In such studies, supervised machine learning methods were able to discriminate between AD and controls using OCT data, suggesting that OCT conveys a wealth of data that can be interpreted for classification of dementia even in the absence of apparent univariate changes37.

3. Choroidal thickness and vasculature

The pathophysiologic basis of studying choroidal and retinal vasculature is the observation that decreased cerebral blood flow precedes clinical dementia38. Histopathology of post mortem eyes with advanced AD demonstrated decreased thickness in the nasal choroid, but significant increase in thickness within the macula compared to age matched controls. The increased macular choroidal thickness correlated with increased stromal vascularity, which might represent a compensatory vasoproliferative response to retinal atrophy in severe AD30.

Choroidal thickness was first studied in vivo using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) SD-OCT as a potential biomarker for AD in 2014 (Figure 2d,e). Contrary to the histopathology findings in severe AD eyes, decreased subfoveal choroidal thickness was demonstrated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD compared to control in 21 eyes, in a population where no difference in RNFL thickness was seen between the groups39. This finding has been redemonstrated in MCI patients with positive amyloid PET in all quadrants around the fovea40, and this loss of thickness has been correlated with poor cognitive testing41–42. However, the relationship between choroidal thickness and AD has been challenged by other studies which show no difference in subfoveal choroidal thickness and presence of AD or MCI when adjusted for age, sex, and visual acuity43.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an emerging imaging modality to directly evaluate choroidal vascularity. For example, OCTA findings recapitulated the aforementioned post mortem findings by performing in vivo analysis of luminal area of choroidal vessels and quantifying the choroidal vascularity index (CVI, ratio of luminal area to total choroidal area), which demonstrated increased luminal area in AD and MCI compared to controls. Interestingly, while decreased CVI was seen in MCI compared to control, no difference in CVI was found between AD and controls.31 Another OCTA study evaluating choroidal flow rate found a trend towards lower choroidal flow rate in patients with AD compared to control, but the difference did not reach statistical significance44.

Interpretation of the conflicting data surrounding choroidal biomarkers is confounded by limitations of individual studies, which are generally limited in sample size, the cross-sectional natures of their design, and analyses seeking to compare large numbers of variables without accounting for the problem of multiple comparisons without employing appropriate statistical methods (such as the Bonferroni correction). The inconsistent data might also reflect the complex relationship between vascular biology and AD. The interplay between choroidal vascular loss, choroidal thinning, and retinal thinning might provide insights into the mechanism and evolution of AD. For example, if retinal vascular changes reflect a diffuse loss of systemic circulation, then choroidal vascular attenuation would be expected to precede retinal vascular attenuation. Microvascular disease and subclinical ischemia might then transiently lead to compensatory increase in choroidal vascularity in preclinical disease or MCI, followed by later attenuation of neurosensory retina. On the other hand, if all the microvascular changes in AD are sequelae of neurodegenerative pathology, we might expect to see structural changes in the inner retina preceding changes in the retinal and choroidal vasculature. Temporal changes in choroidal biomarkers over the spectrum of AD warrant further study.

4. Retinal vasculature

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with deposition of amyloid and collagen within cerebral capillaries. Vascular density and architecture can be quantitatively analyzed from fundus photos using automated software with equivocal results45. Decreased arteriolar fractal dimension and venular fractal dimension have been shown to be associated with AD46 in some studies, while others have found no difference between AD and control47. A systematic review from 2013 noted decreased vascular density and presence of microvascular changes to be weakly associated with the presence of dementia, but its utility as a screening tool was difficult to conclude48.

As with choroidal vascularity, OCTA has been a natural imaging modality for studying retinal vasculature, and has more consistently shown changes associated with AD. In particular, decreased vessel density and increased foveal avascular zone (FAZ) has been demonstrated in AD49. A twin discordance study described monozygotic twins discordant for presentation of AD, and found significantly reduced vessel density and larger FAZ in the superficial capillary plexus in the twin with AD50. Decreased retinal vascular density (most notably in the fovea) and significantly enlarged FAZ correlated also with decreased cognitive function on MMSE44. Vascularity of different vascular layers in the retina has also been correlated with structural OCT biomarkers. Loss of vessel density in the deep venous plexus and superficial capillary plexus were associated with GC-IPL thinning in AD patients, but was not observed in control or MCI groups in separate studies51–52.

Preclinical changes in retinal vasculature have been studied in cognitively normal patients with positive in vivo biomarkers. FAZ area increased in patients with positive amyloid PET/CT or cerebrospinal fluid compared to age matched controls without AD biomarkers53. Another study found no difference in FAZ size in patients with positive amyloid PET/CT, but noted a higher vessel density in preclinical biomarker positive patients compared to controls – a finding that resonates with the choroidal vascularity index trends in MCI noted above54.

In addition to structural changes, functional differences in retinal vasculature of AD patients have also been studied. The dynamic response of vessel dilation to a flicker light stimulation, for example, characteristically results in a primary vasodilatory response followed by vasoconstriction. A study of dynamic vessel analysis found that arterial dilation was decreased in AD compared to age-matched controls, and the reaction amplitude was decreased in both AD and MCI patients (controlling for confounding retinal diseases that are known to be associated with reduced flicker-induced vasodilation), which suggests a decoupling of neurovascular response in patients with cognitive impairment55. Oxygen saturation in retinal arterioles and venules has also been studied using noninvasive spectrophotometric oximetry. Two studies have shown increased oxygen saturation in AD and MCI patients compared to age matched controls, suggesting possible decrease in metabolic activity in the retina56–57.

5. Amyloid and tau imaging

While amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are well-established findings in the central nervous system, data for corresponding retinal protein deposition in Alzheimer’s disease have been less consistent. Several post mortem studies that looked at immunostaining of amyloid-β and phosphorylated-tau ocular tissue from autopsy-positive AD patients found no abnormal amyloid or tau deposits in any ocular structures to correlate with CNS histopathology58,59,60. Other studies have identified amyloid plaques in retinal tissue of post mortem eyes of both AD and suspected AD patients61. Yet others have reported equivocal findings in retinas of patients with autopsy-confirmed clinicopathologic diagnoses of AD62. A meta-analysis evaluating the evidence of retinal amyloid plaques for diagnosis in AD found existing studies to be too varied in study design and tissue preparation and staining techniques to draw definite conclusions63.

In spite of the as-yet unclear value of retinal amyloid or tau deposition in the diagnosis of AD, several novel methods to noninvasively detect amyloid on retinal imaging have been described. Koronyo et al described using curcumin as a contrast agent that binds amyloid-β with high affinity, in combination with modified SLO, to directly image retinal amyloid-β protein. The authors developed a quantitative measure of increased curcumin fluorescence – the “retinal amyloid index” – as a potential biomarker to delineate AD compared to control. In their proof of principle study with 10 mild-moderate AD patients and 6 healthy controls, and found a 2 fold curcumin fluorescence increase in the AD population64. Of interest, curcurmin-labeled plaques were identified in the retina earlier than it was detected in the brains of a murine model of AD, which suggests its potential utility as a retinal biomarker in early stages of disease61. Hyperspectral imaging is another potential modality that has been studied for identification of early pathological changes in the retina based on the differential scattering of light from abnormal amyloid aggregates65.

6. Artificial intelligence

The advent of computer vision and deep learning algorithms has proven to be a powerful tool in medical imaging analyses. Artificial intelligence research in ophthalmology to date has largely focused on common ophthalmic diseases such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy, and has demonstrated comparable performance between deep learning algorithms and human experts in classifying disease66.

In the context of Alzheimer’s disease, machine learning has been used to classify fundus photos of patients with AD compared to control from the UK Biobank open-access database with 82% accuracy67. Multimodal imaging has also been used to train AI models, and found improved area under the curve compared to a single imaging modality input68. However, both studies were limited by low samples sizes of AD patients, exclusion of poor image quality, and exclusion of common comorbid retinal diseases – all of which confounds the applicability of the findings to real life screening applications.

Nonetheless, AI holds great promise for furthering the study of biomarkers in AD. Potential applications of AI include providing new insights based on known features, or discerning novel features and biomarkers that are not currently known. As an example of the former, deep learning algorithms applied to histologic sections from brain biopsies of AD patients were able to successfully quantify levels of phosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles, and found that neurofibrillary tangle burden was strongly associated with cognitive impairment in AD patients69. As an example of the latter, parallel work on identifying early biomarkers for age related macular degeneration described a framework agnostic to prespecified parameters that successfully discovered new structural biomarkers on OCT that correlated with function70.

Challenges and future directions

Research on the topic of retinal biomarkers for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease has shed light on interesting associations between retinal imaging findings and AD, but validation of these findings in the clinical setting has yet to be demonstrated. Furthermore, conflicting data for many of the potential biomarkers discussed in this review undermines the strength of evidence supporting their relevance and potential utility.

Multiple challenges impede interpretation of present data, and highlight areas that need to be addressed in future studies of retinal biomarkers. For example, diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease has evolved over time, and there might be a discordance between population of patients with AD and MCI diagnosed clinically as opposed to those diagnosed according to more rigid classifications of disease on the basis of in vivo biomarkers such as CSF or PET/CT amyloid. On the contrary, data from autopsy studies of patients with significant AD neuropathology has identified sizeable populations of people without manifestations of clinical disease, termed “resilient” populations71. Both of these discrepancies might account for inadvertent misclassifications of patients and obscures the ability to generalize conclusions. A list of studies to date that have evaluated prodromal disease (as defined by positive in vivo biomarker in patients with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment) is summarized in Table 1, and will be an important area of development in future in order to more rigorously define the relationship between retinal biomarker and the specific stage of AD.

Comorbid retinal disease is another obstacle that complicates biomarker research in AD. While most research studies take care to exclude patients with age related macular degeneration (ARMD), for example, the demographics of patients with AD or preclinical AD invariably overlap with those who are at highest risk of having ARMD. When considering biomarkers that might simultaneously have manifestations in both disease processes, such as retinal amyloid deposition in drusen of ARMD patients72, the optimal biomarker must have the ability to discern AD in spite of confounding retinal disease in order to have practical utility in clinical settings. Retinal biomarker profiles might also be confounded by similarities between AD and other causes of cognitive impairment such as vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia, and similarly will need to be able to differentiate between these etiologies73.

Other challenges include the small numbers of cases described in most studies. Given the heterogeneity in presentation of AD, associations found on the basis of small patient populations might introduce unexpected biases and limit generalizability to communities at large. Sharing of large datasets will be important to overcome these limitations, as well as allow us to harness the potential power of AI in generating new insights. Challenges of obtaining retinal images of sufficient quality for analysis in community cohorts will also need to be addressed prior to practical implementation at a large scale. In the population of interest for AD, confounding obstacles related to patient cooperation and media opacities, for example, might significantly hinder the ability to obtain consistent and useful data. For example, in one recent population based OCT-A study, images of sufficient quality for analysis was obtained in only 55% of patients74.

Finally, a standardized framework to approach future studies, such as that proposed recently by Cheung et al75, would help promote consistency across study design. Such a framework would be relevant not just for evaluation of retinal biomarkers, but also biomarkers involving other ocular tissues such as the lens76, aqueous humor77, and cornea78.

Conclusions

Finding a disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer’s disease with definitive benefit to clinical endpoints has been an elusive goal of research in the field of AD. Discovery and validation of in vivo disease-specific biomarkers has prompted a shift in research interest to early and prodromal stages of disease as an opportune window in which to intervene, prior to the onset of irreversible neurovascular changes. Current clinical standards of diagnosis are limited by cost, accessibility, and inaccuracy. In this context, the possibility of identifying noninvasive, accurate, inexpensive biomarkers to help screen for and follow the progression of disease represents an important goal. Advances in specialized noninvasive retinal imaging and computer processing power positions the search for retinal biomarkers well to contribute to this endeavor.
