White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are associated with higher risk of typical amnestic Alzheimer’s disease (tAD). Little is known about the frequency and distribution of WMH in atypical variants of AD, including logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). We investigated WMHs in 75 LPA, 39 PCA, and 50 tAD patients and associations with age, beta-amyloid PET burden, and cognition. PCA had greater subcortical WMHs in right occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes compared to LPA, and greater parieto-occipital subcortical and occipital periventricular WMHs than tAD. LPA had greater subcortical WMHs in left parietal lobe and deep white matter WMHs than PCA, and greater fronto-occipital subcortical and occipital periventricular WMHs than tAD. Total WMH increased with increasing age but was not related to beta-amyloid burden. Greater WMH was associated with visuoperceptual performance in LPA and PCA after correcting for atrophy. WMH topography differs across AD variants. Further work is needed to determine whether they reflect cerebrovascular disease or regionally specific neurodegenerative changes.

pmcIntroduction

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) typically result from cerebral small vessel disease and are observed as diffuse hyperintense areas on T2-weighted MRI scans (Fazekas et al., 1993). White matter hyperintensities are often found in elderly people regardless of dementia status (Alber et al., 2019; de Leeuw et al., 2001), and WMH burden is associated with cognitive impairment (DeCarli et al., 1995; Pantoni, 2010; Schmidt et al., 1993) and Aβ deposition on amyloid PET in the elderly (Graff-Radford et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2021). White matter hyperintensities can be subdivided based on locations in periventricular and subcortical regions, and there is evidence that clinical and Aβ associations, pathophysiology and genetic underpinnings may differ by location (Armstrong et al., 2020; Graff-Radford et al., 2019).

Increased WMH burden has been associated with a higher risk and progression of typical amnestic Alzheimer’s disease (tAD) (Brickman et al., 2015; Georgakis et al., 2019; Scheltens et al., 1992). WMH burden is also recognized as a common feature of tAD which could appear well before symptom onset (Lee et al., 2016), and WMH correlate with a small but consistent decline in cognitive functioning (Brickman et al., 2008; van den Berg et al., 2018). However, less is known about WMH in atypical presentations of AD that usually have a younger age of onset, typically occurring under 65 years of age (Galton et al., 2000; van der Flier et al., 2011). Two common forms of atypical AD are posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA). PCA is characterized by progressive loss of visual processing, calculation, navigation skills, and other posterior brain functions which are associated with pronounced atrophy of parietal, occipital, and occipitotemporal cortices (Crutch et al., 2012; Tang-Wai et al., 2004; Whitwell et al., 2007). In contrast, LPA is characterized by prominent language impairment in the form of hesitant speech, anomia, and difficulties with sentence repetition, and is associated with atrophy of left temporo-parietal regions (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2008; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011; Madhavan et al., 2013; Rohrer et al., 2010). WMH have been observed in patients with LPA and PCA, although WMH burden was lower than that observed in tAD (Whitwell et al., 2015). There is also some evidence that WMH may be related to Aβ PET uptake in LPA, whereby patients with high occipital Aβ had greater WMH burden (Whitwell et al., 2014; Whitwell et al., 2013). However, little is known about the regional distribution of WMH or whether regional WMH are related to cognition or Aβ burden in atypical AD.

The aim of the current study was to determine whether the frequency of regional WMH differs between LPA and PCA, and whether these atypical AD variants differ from tAD, and determine whether WMH are related to cognition or Aβ burden in atypical AD.

Methods

Patient selection

Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for PCA (Crutch et al., 2012) or LPA (Botha et al., 2015; Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011) have been consecutively recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG) between 2010 and 2017. All patients underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessments, 3T MRI, including a magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence, and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET to assess Aβ burden. For this study, we included all PCA and LPA patients that had evidence of Aβ deposition on PET and had undergone a fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to allow the assessment of WMH (39 PCA and 75 LPA). Positivity on Aβ-PET was determined using a global PiB-PET standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) cut-point of 1.48 (Klunk et al., 2015). Most participants underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping. Six patients were excluded as they were Aβ negative.

For comparison, we identified 50 Aβ-positive patients with tAD that had been recruited by the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) between 2007 to 2017. The tAD cohort was matched at the group-level to the atypical AD cohort by age and gender. All tAD patients had undergone identical 3T MRI, FLAIR, and Aβ-PET as the atypical AD cohort.

Clinical assessments

The neurological and neuropsychological assessments of the LPA and PCA patients included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Battery (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al., 2005) to assess general cognitive function, the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III (Goetz et al., 2008) to assess Parkinsonism, the 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT) (Lansing et al., 1999) to assess naming, the Western Aphasia Battery Repetition subscore to assess sentence repetition, the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) (Dubois et al., 2000) and Trail Making Test (TMT A and TMT B) (Strauss et al., 2006) to assess executive function, and the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP) (Warrington and James, 1991) incomplete letters and cubes tests to assess visuoperceptual and visuospatial functioning. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all individuals provided consent to participate in the study.

The tAD patients underwent a different and largely non-overlapping clinical battery in the ADRC which included testing for general cognitive function. Twenty-three of the 50 tAD patients had completed MoCA, while the rest were assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MMSE scores were then converted to MoCA using published methods (Trzepacz et al., 2015).

Image acquisition

All MRI scans were performed using a standardized protocol on a 3T GE scanner, including an MPRAGE (TR/TE/TI, 2300/3/900 ms; flip angle 8°, 26-cm field of view (FOV); 256 × 256 in-plane matrix with a phase FOV of 0.94, and slice thickness of 1.2mm) and two-dimensional T2 FLAIR (TR=11,000 ms, TE=147 ms, TI=2250 ms, 256 × 192 matrix, 24-cm field of view and 3-mm slice thickness). All Aβ-PET scans were performed on a PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) operating in 3D mode. Participants were injected with PiB of approximately 628 MBq (range, 385–723 MBq) and, after a 40–60-minute uptake period, a 20-minute PiB scan was obtained.

MRI analysis

All FLAIR images first went through an automated segmentation process using in-house software (Graff-Radford et al., 2019), then were manually edited by our trained imaging analysts. Total WMH volume was scaled by total intracranial volume (TIV) to correct for differences in head size, and a cut-point of 1.7% was used to identify individuals with abnormal WMH burden, as previously described (Graff-Radford et al., 2020). Regional WMH burden was also calculated using an in-house 22-region atlas which categorizes WMH as subcortical or periventricular and calculates WMH burden within brain lobes, as well as in corpus callosum, brainstem, cerebellum, and deep white matter. The atlas was propagated to the corresponding MPRAGE using Unified Segmentation in SPM12 (Ashburner and Friston, 2005), then resampled using nearest neighbor interpolation to the FLAIR image space, using rigid alignment parameters from the coregistration. Regional WMH burdens were corrected for TIV. All infarctions were also marked by trained image analysts. Cortical infarctions were characterized as hyperintense T2 FLAIR lesions (gliosis) involving cortical grey matter that extended to the cortical edge with or without involvement of the underlying WM (with confirmation from structural T1 images). Subcortical infarctions were characterized as hyperintense T2 FLAIR lesions with a dark center, seen in the WM, infratentorial, and central grey-capsular regions. Voxels associated with infarcts were removed from the WMH measurements.

All MPRAGE scans were segmented into grey and white matter using unified segmentation, and grey and white matter were summed to calculate total brain volume. Patterns of grey matter volume loss in the PCA and LPA groups compared to controls were assessed at the voxel-level using SPM12, adjusted for age and sex. The control cohort consisted of 20 cognitively normal individuals recruited by NRG between 2017 and 2021 (age=63.2 years, range 56–84). Results were assessed uncorrected (p&lt;0.001) and corrected for multiple comparisons (Family wise error (FWE) correction at p&lt;0.05). BrainNet Viewer (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/) was used to visualize SPM12 results.

PiB-PET analysis

The PiB-PET images were registered to the patients’ MPRAGE using 6-degree-of-freedom rigid body registration. Normalization parameters were computed between each MPRAGE and the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mcalt/) using ANTs (Avants et al., 2008). With these parameters, the MCALT atlas was propagated to the native MPRAGE space and used to calculate regional PET values in the grey and white matter. Tissue probabilities were determined by segmenting each MPRAGE using Unified Segmentation (Ashburner and Friston, 2005) in SPM12, with MCALT tissue priors and settings. Median Aβ-PET values in lobar ROIs were divided by median uptake in cerebellar crus grey matter to create SUVRs.

Statistical analysis

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, Pearson’s Chi-squared test, and Fisher’s exact test were appropriately used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics between the LPA, PCA, and tAD groups. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used for continuous variables. Fisher’s exact test was applied to categorical variables. Pearson’s Chi-squared test was used to evaluate the association between the three disease groups and the absence/presences of gender (Male), APOE ε4 genotype, and WMH burden.

WMH volume was adjusted for TIV and log-transformed to remove the skewness of the original data and meet model assumptions. Logistic regressions were used to determine the associations between regional WMH volume and LPA, PCA, or tAD diagnosis, adjusting for age. Spearman rank correlations were used to evaluate the relationship of WMH burden with age.

Correlations between adjusted regional WMH volume and Aβ-PET SUVRs were evaluated using linear regression while correcting for age. Adjusted WMH volumes for determined regions were entered as dependent variables, with SUVR values entered as independent variables.

Associations between adjusted total WMH volume and clinical scores in the LPA and PCA patients were assessed using linear regressions, corrected for age and total brain volume to account for the contributions of atrophy. Linear regression analysis was also used to access the relationship between regional WMH burden and specific clinical tests in LPA and PCA, again correcting for age and total brain volume. Statistical analyses were performed on R version 4.0.3. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Descriptions of the cohort

The three AD cohorts differed in terms of age at exam, age at onset and disease duration, with the oldest age and shortest disease duration observed in LPA (Table 1). The tAD group showed the highest frequency of APOE Ɛ4 carriers. No significant differences were observed across the AD cohorts in terms of education, TIV, gender, handedness, and frequency of abnormal WMH burden. The two atypical AD cohorts differed in clinical metrics as expected, with worse naming and repetition in LPA and worse visuospatial and perceptual performance in PCA. In addition, LPA showed worse parkinsonism on the MDS-UPDRS III and executive deficits on the FAB, while PCA showed slower processing speed on TMT A.

The LPA, PCA, and tAD groups showed the expected patterns of grey matter volume loss compared to controls, with LPA showing loss predominantly in the left temporoparietal lobe, PCA showing loss predominantly in occipital and parietal lobes, and tAD showing bilateral temporoparietal and medial temporal loss (Figure 1). The PCA group showed greater occipital atrophy than both LPA and tAD, and the LPA group showed greater left temporal atrophy compared to both PCA and tAD (Supplementary Figure 1).

Infarcts were rare in our cohort. Cortical infarcts were observed in two PCA patients (left frontal in one patient and bilateral frontal, right parietal, right occipital in the other) one LPA patient (left temporal and left occipital), three tAD patients (right frontal in one subject, bilateral occipital in another, and right parietal in the last one), and subcortical infarcts were also observed in one of these PCA patients as well as three other tAD subjects.

WMH findings across LPA, PCA and tAD

We fit a regression line and output a Spearman’s correlation coefficient on the scatterplot showing the association between WMH burden and age at scan within each disease group. Total WMH burden was related to age in LPA, PCA and tAD, with greater burden observed with older age (p&lt;0.002 in all disease groups) (Figure 2). No patients under the age of 59 had abnormal WMH burden using the 1.7% cut-point. The frequencies of abnormal WMH burden were 13% of atypical AD patients aged 60–69 years and 38% of those aged 70 years and over. The frequencies in tAD were 14% of 60–69 years and 25% of those over 70 years.

Total WMH burden and frequency of abnormal WMH burden were similar across LPA, PCA and tAD (Table 1). However, there were regional differences in WMH distribution observed across groups, after adjusting for TIV and age at MRI (p&lt;0.05; Figure 3 and Table 2). Specifically, PCA showed greater subcortical WMH burden in the right occipital, parietal and temporal lobes compared to LPA. Conversely, LPA showed greater WMH burden in left deep white matter and greater subcortical WMH burden in the left parietal lobe compared to PCA. Example FLAIR images for LPA and PCA are shown in Figure 4. When compared to tAD, LPA showed greater periventricular WMH burden in left occipital lobe, and greater subcortical WMH burden in left frontal lobe, as well as left occipital lobe. PCA showed greater periventricular WMH burden in right occipital lobe, greater subcortical WMH burden in bilateral occipital lobe, right parietal lobe, and greater WMH burden in anterior corpus callosum compared to tAD (Figure 3 and Table 2).

WMH associations in atypical AD

In the atypical AD patients, no relationships were identified between total WMH burden and global PiB SUVR (Table 3), or between WMH burden and regional PiB SUVR in the frontal, right temporal, parietal, or occipital lobes. In the left temporal lobe, higher PiB SUVR was associated with lower WMH burden (p=0.039).

The results of the linear regression analyses of total WMH and clinical scores are shown in Table 4 and Figure 5. Greater total WMH burden was associated with VOSP letters in the LPA cohort (p=0.049), after correction for brain atrophy, with trends observed for WMH burden to be associated with VOSP cubes (p=0.067), UPDRS III (p=0.081), and the BNT (p=0.093). Greater total WMH burden was also associated with VOSP letters in PCA after correction for atrophy (p=0.016). Given the associations with VOSP letters, we further investigated associations with regional WMH. After correction for age and atrophy, VOSP letters was associated with WMH burden in right subcortical occipital, bilateral subcortical parietal, and right subcortical temporal lobes in both atypical groups (Supplementary Table 1). Additionally, VOSP letters was associated with WMH burden in left periventricular parietal, left subcortical occipital, and left subcortical temporal lobes in PCA.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that WMH burden increases with age in atypical AD as well as in tAD. While global WMH burden did not differ between PCA and LPA patients, there were regional differences in the distribution of WMH between these syndromes and compared to tAD. There was also some evidence that WMH were associated with visuoperceptual performance in LPA and PCA.

Utilizing a previously published cut-point (Graff-Radford et al., 2020), we found that 17% of LPA and 15% of PCA patients had abnormal WMH burden, and these frequencies did not differ from tAD. WMH burden increased with age: fractions of atypical AD participants with suprathreshold burden were 0% at age &lt;60, 13% at age 60–69, and 38% at age 70 and over. A previous study utilizing the same methods and cut-point reported that the prevalence of abnormal WMH in the population was 5% in people aged 60–69, 16.5% in people aged 70–79, and 47.5% in people aged 80–89 (Graff-Radford et al., 2020). Hence, the prevalence in atypical AD appears higher than expected in the population. We also found that the prevalence of WMH was slightly greater in women than men, consistent with findings in this age range from a population-based study (Graff-Radford et al., 2020), although we did not observe any gender differences in the relationships between WMHs and age. While previous studies have used different methods to dichotomize WMH level, most similarly concluded that higher WMH burden is often found in tAD compared to normally aged individuals (Damulina et al., 2019; Garnier-Crussard et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Infarctions were rare in our cohort, possibly due to the relatively young age.

The regional distribution of subcortical WMH differed between LPA and PCA, with the regional differences largely matching the regional patterns of neurodegeneration associated with these two syndromes. We found that the PCA patients had greater subcortical WMH burden in right occipital, parietal and temporal lobes compared to LPA which is consistent with the fact that PCA also showed greater volume loss in these regions. The LPA patients had greater subcortical WMH burden the in left parietal lobe compared to PCA. This is consistent with the left-sided patterns of neurodegeneration observed in LPA, although on direct comparison volume of the left parietal lobe did not differ between groups. These findings raise the question of whether the presence of WMH in these atypical AD syndromes is a by-product of neurodegeneration rather than a marker of systemic small vessel disease that is independent of neurodegeneration. Similar findings have been reported in typical AD, where WMH are predominantly observed in posterior regions of the brain that are typically atrophic (Garnier-Crussard et al., 2021; Gootjes et al., 2004; Huynh et al., 2021). It is possible that neurodegeneration reduces the integrity of underlying white matter via wallerian degeneration resulting in axonal loss and demyelination (Leys et al., 1991; McAleese et al., 2017). Other possible pathological substrates for these WMHs could include neuroinflammation (Alber et al., 2019) or vacuolization in degenerating tissue. However, neurodegeneration and tau deposition are more severe in younger atypical AD patients (Whitwell et al., 2019), while WMH are more common in older typical AD patients (Benedictus et al., 2013). Therefore, the mechanisms driving WMH in atypical AD are likely complex and involve an interplay between age-related vulnerability and neurodegeneration. Further studies are needed to investigate underlying mechanisms. In addition to the lobar findings, we also reported greater burden of left deep white matter WMH in LPA compared to PCA, although the etiology of these WMHs is unclear. Interestingly, the regional distribution of WMH was not consistent with the predominant frontal distribution of microbleeds we previously reported in atypical AD (Whitwell et al., 2014; Whitwell et al., 2015). We previously also noted no spatial relationship between the distribution of microbleeds and regional WMH in a small LPA cohort (Whitwell et al., 2014). This regional disconnect also suggests that these different cerebrovascular disease lesions result from different underlying mechanisms in atypical AD, with microbleeds likely reflecting underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Buciuc et al., 2021).

Interestingly, both LPA and PCA had greater subcortical and periventricular WMHs in the occipital lobe compared to the age-matched tAD group. This finding concurs with the topographic pattern of neurodegeneration observed in PCA, but less so in LPA. The reason for the occipital findings in LPA is unclear, although it could suggest that both atypical AD variants are susceptible to WMHs in the occipital lobe. Other differences were observed between these atypical AD variants and tAD that matched patterns of neurodegeneration, with LPA showing greater left frontal subcortical WMHs, and PCA showing greater right parietal subcortical WMHs, compared to tAD. We did not find any regions that showed greater WMHs in tAD compared to LPA and PCA, which could support a link between WMHs and neurodegeneration since cortical neurodegeneration is typically greater in atypical AD compared to tAD, even within age-matched patients (Josephs et al., 2020). Interestingly, patients with dementia with Lewy bodies show similar patterns of hypometabolism to PCA (Whitwell et al., 2017) and have also been shown to have greater occipital WMH compared to tAD (Sarro et al., 2017).

Our investigation into the relationship between total WMH burden and clinical outcomes revealed a relationship with visuoperceptual performance measured using VOSP letters in LPA and PCA patients after correcting for brain atrophy. There was evidence that this association was driven by WMHs in the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes in both LPA and PCA. Hence, atypical AD appears to have a propensity for WMHs in posterior regions of the brain and there is some evidence that these WMHs may contribute to cognitive decline. It should be noted, however, that there was a lack of range in VOSP letters scores in the LPA cohort with many patients performing at ceiling which could have influenced the analysis. It is also difficult to completely rule out contributions of neurodegeneration. Previous studies assessing typical AD have observed relationships between cognition and WMH burden (Garnier-Crussard et al., 2021; Huynh et al., 2021), with one finding a relationship between global cognitive dysfunction and total WMH burden after correcting for volume, also suggesting some additive effect of WMH on top of neurodegeneration in these patients (Garnier-Crussard et al., 2021).

We also explored the relationship of WMH and Aβ burden measured on PET. We found no strong evidence that global or regional WMH burden was associated with degree of Aβ deposition in atypical AD. Previous studies have observed relationships between WMH pattern and Aβ accumulation in cognitively unimpaired elderly adults (Graff-Radford et al., 2019; Moscoso et al., 2020; Roseborough et al., 2017), but these relationships have similarly not been observed within tAD cohorts (Gurol et al., 2013). A recent study by Garnier-Crussard et al (2021) investigated WMH topography in typical or amnestic AD by enrolling Aβ-positive AD patients and matched Aβ-negative controls and they found that WMH contribute to cognitive impairment in AD, independently from Aβ (Garnier-Crussard et al., 2021). Collectively, these results suggest that the presence of Aβ deposition will increase the likelihood that an individual will also have WMH but once a patient has AD, WMH burden is likely driven by other factors, such as age and possibly tau-driven neurodegeneration. Future studies utilizing tau PET will be important to determine the role of regional tau deposition to WMH in atypical AD.

Strengths of our study include the large cohort of LPA and PCA patients available for analysis and the fact that all atypical AD patients underwent a standardized neurological and neuropsychological battery and standardized neuroimaging. All patients in our cohort underwent PiB PET and had biomarker evidence of Aβ deposition on PET confirming underlying AD. In addition, WMH evaluation was done semi-automatically with manual review to correct algorithm errors. A limitation, however, was the fact that we did not have information on vascular risk factors in our patients which could help clarify whether WMH in atypical AD have any relationship to vascular disease. Second, not all patients had tau PET imaging so we could not assess the relationship between WMH and tau deposits. Lastly, although the tAD group was well matched in age to the PCA group, the LPA subjects were older than patients in the other two groups.

In summary, this study demonstrates that abnormal WMH do occur in patients with atypical presentations of AD, albeit strongly associated with older age1.7. Evidence on the regional distribution of WMH suggests that they may be more strongly related to regional neurodegeneration in this cohort rather than small vessel disease, although more work is needed to further explore the mechanisms underlying WMH in atypical AD, the relationship to cardiovascular risk factors, and to determine whether strategies and treatments to reduce cardiovascular risk factors could benefit these patients. Future studies will also be needed to determine the relationship between WMHs and progression of disease in these patients.
