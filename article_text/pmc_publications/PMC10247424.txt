Tauopathies, which include frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, are a class of neurological disorders resulting from pathogenic tau aggregates. These aggregates disrupt neuronal health and function leading to the cognitive and physical decline of tauopathy patients. Genome-wide association studies and clinical evidence have brought to light the large role of the immune system in inducing and driving tau-mediated pathology. More specifically, innate immune genes are found to harbor tauopathy risk alleles and innate immune pathways are upregulated throughout the course of disease. Experimental evidence has expanded on these findings by describing pivotal roles for the innate immune system in the regulation of tau kinases and tau aggregates. In this review, we summarize the literature implicating innate immune pathways as drivers of tauopathy.

Graphical Abstract

In this review article, we summarize emerging evidence that implicates aberrant innate immune responses in the pathogenesis of tauopathies such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In particular, we discuss how dysregulated control of inflammasomes, toll-like receptor signaling, proinflammatory cytokine production, microglial responses, and complement activation contributes to tauopathies.

pmcINTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Neurological disorders resulting from pathogenic tau aggregates are called tauopathies. These include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Pathogenic tau acts in a prion-like manner, aggregating within neurons, spreading throughout the brain, and inducing neurodegeneration. Tau aggregates exist as oligomers, straight helical filaments (SHF) or paired helical filaments (PHF), and, in the most advanced cases, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

Neurons are specialized postmitotic cells that rely on complex arrays of microtubules (MTs) to support their health and structure over a lifetime. MTs are dynamically built and destroyed to accommodate the structural needs of the neuron and to aid in the transport of organelles and other components throughout the cell. MT-associated proteins (MAPs), which include tau, play critical roles in the stabilization of MTs. Of the neuronal MAPs, tau is of significant biomedical interest as it can acquire neuropathogenic properties following specific post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Although PTMs occur under normal physiology, these events can accumulate and cause tau to become pathogenic.

In the context of the central nervous system (CNS), innate immune responses were once less appreciated due to the brain’s supposed ‘immune privileged’ status. However, recent characterization of resident macrophage populations in the CNS [1],[2], the meningeal lymphatics [3], and immunological risk loci observed in neurogenerative diseases has expanded our understanding of the role of the innate immune system in neurological disease [4]. The innate immune response is an evolutionary conserved and inherited line of defense against generalized pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively). Innate immune responses are deployed to limit harm to the host and to recruit additional immune players to sites of injury and infection. Numerous outstanding reviews have been written to highlight the critical functions of the innate immune system in a variety of neurological disorders including traumatic brain injury (TBI) [5], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [6],[7], and amyloid beta (Aβ)-mediated pathology in AD [8]-[13]. In contrast, far less attention in the field has been paid to summarizing the contributions of innate immunity in tauopathies [14]. Therefore, in this review, we provide an overview of the emerging body of literature which defines pivotal roles for the innate immune system in tauopathy pathogenesis.

INFLAMMATION AS A DRIVER OF TAUOPATHY

INFECTION DRIVING DISEASE ONSET

AD is classically characterized by the progressive, aging-associated buildup of neurotoxic Aβ plaques followed by the generation of pathological NFTs and neuroinflammation. Additionally, some investigators have recently hypothesized that infections and the ensuing anti-pathogen immune responses can also contribute to AD pathogenesis. In this so-called “infection hypothesis of AD”, it is believed that toxic protein aggregation, such as NFT formation, occurs in response to immune challenges and that this can incite a perpetuating cascade of neurotoxic protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, which ultimately culminates in neuronal loss and dementia [15]. Immune challenges are known drivers of systemic inflammation that can perturb the homeostatic milieu of the brain parenchyma. Multiple epidemiological and murine studies have reported that various pathogens can accelerate or induce toxic buildup of proteins and cognitive decline [16]-[23]. Those related to tauopathy onset are summarized in the next paragraph.

As will be highlighted throughout this review, tau is sensitive to the pro-inflammatory reaction induced by the activation of the innate immune system (Fig. 1). Interestingly, this does not appear to be exclusive to the brain’s innate immune response, as emerging evidence suggests that systemic inflammatory responses initiated outside of the brain can also provoke tauopathies [24],[25]. For instance, severe cases of pneumonia have been reported to have detrimental effects on tau-mediated pathology and cognition [26]. Indeed, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lungs has been shown to promote the release of tau from alveolar capillary cells into the serum and sputum of mice and humans. When naïve mice were exposed to either the serum or sputum, they were found to subsequently develop sporadic tauopathy and long-term delirium [23]. A follow-up study suggested that this was due to the prion-like nature of the released tau affecting otherwise healthy neuronal tau. In these studies, it was shown that in vivo P. aeruginosa infection increases hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) burden and impairs hippocampal physiology [18].

Likewise, measles virus is highly associated with NFTs present in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Although the mechanism linking measles virus infection to NFT accumulation has not been nailed down yet, in situ hybridization studies uncovered a strong correlation between tau burden, cells containing the measles virus, and NFTs positive for measles genes [19]. In terms of neurotropic viruses, herpes simplex virus-1 has been reported to invade neurons and induce pathogenic MT dynamics, which includes the hyperphosphorylation of tau leading to neurodegeneration [17],[20],[21]. Additionally, gastrointestinal infection caused by Helicobacter pylori is known to correlate with higher p-tau burden in AD patients despite not being neurotropic [27]. Future studies are needed to further interrogate how infections mechanistically contribute to tau-mediated disease progression and the role of the innate immune system in this process. Additional work is also needed to explore whether the robust systemic innate immune responses generated during SARS-CoV-2 infection can also influence tauopathy pathogenesis [28].

MODELING NEUROINFLAMMATION

To model the inflammatory state during infection, researchers have turned to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment to model bacterial infection. Acute and high-dose treatments of LPS trigger the potent release of proinflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells [16]. In utero, the developing brain is susceptible to maternal immune activation (MIA) mounted in response to PAMPs such as LPS and PolyI:C [29]. When 3xTG-AD mice, which harbor both tau and Aβ pathology due to the expression of MAPT P301L, APP Swedish, and PSEN1 M146V mutations [30], underwent MIA at embryonic day 17, they exhibited accelerated tau and Aβ pathologies when compared to those born from control-treated mothers [31]. In the same mouse strain, adulthood challenges with LPS or the neuroadapted JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus increased p-tau burden but not Aβ cleavage events, suggesting that tau is more susceptible to the immune response when compared to Aβ [16],[32]. In the hTau mouse model, where the complete human MAPT gene is knocked in and the murine Mapt is knocked out, p-tau levels were also found to be increased following high-dose intraperitoneal LPS stimulation [33],[34]. Likewise, intracranial LPS injections in the P301L MAPT mouse line demonstrated a similar increase in p-tau [35].

Conversely, chronic low-dose LPS treatments can induce immunological tolerance that is characterized by the gradual suppression of pro-inflammatory responses and the concomitant enhancement of anti-inflammatory capabilities [36]. The induction of immune tolerance through this chronic low LPS treatment paradigm has been found to be neuroprotective in murine models of ischemia, spinal injury, Aβ amyloidosis, and epilepsy [37]. Likewise, chronic low-dose LPS stimulation in PS19 mice, which harbor a P301S mutant MAPT gene, was found to protect against cognitive decline and upregulate neuronal autophagy, which will be discussed in a later section [38]. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence and additional motivations for mechanistic investigation of how the innate immune system alters tau-mediated pathology.

INNATE PATHWAYS

Toll-like Receptor Signaling

The innate immune system has evolved to broadly sense DAMPs and PAMPs. To accomplish this task quickly, the immune system employs a wide variety of pattern recognition receptors. Of these, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are commonly employed to sense extracellular and intracellular threats. These receptors typically associate with MyD88 or TRIF to carry out their effector cascades, and downstream signaling activates pro-inflammatory responses through NF-κB, anti-inflammatory signals through MAPK, or anti-viral responses through interferon release [39]. The current body of literature suggests that TLR signaling can instigate and exacerbate tau-mediated pathogenesis. More specifically, it is thought that TLR-mediated production of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, can promote the downstream over-activation of key tau kinases, including Cdk5, MAPK, GSK3β, and JNK (Fig. 2A). This unchecked regulation of tau kinases then leads to tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent tau aggregation. For example, in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line, TLR3 stimulation via PolyI:C was found to cause hyperphosphorylation of tau on Ser396/404 through JNK and p38-MAPK [40]. In cases of diabetic encephalopathy, an inflammatory condition associated with NFTs and insulin resistance, TLR9 is known to be upregulated. Using an in vitro assay, high glucose environments were further shown to induce TLR9 expression within neurons and to launch a p38-MAPK cascade culminating in increased levels of p-tau [41].

Tau has also recently been proposed to directly activate TLR signaling [42]. For instance, it was shown in cell culture studies that treatment of human primary macrophages or the THP-1 macrophage cell line with pathogenic species of exogenous tau can incite a TLR4-dependent proinflammatory response characterized by the release of tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-6, and CCL5 [42]. Although the added p-tau in this experiment was purely phosphorylated tau, TLR stimulation in tauopathy brains may be induced through the sensation of RNA fragments found within NFTs [43]. In all, TLR signaling seems to be a valid mechanism in which tauopathies propagate through the brain. Despite this, there have yet to be targeted interventions that mitigate TLR-induced inflammation to slow clinical progression.

Complement Signaling

The complement system is a set of protein cleavage events that work to tag, opsonize, and lyse immunological threats. The complement system initiates through one of three pathways: classical, alternative, and lectin. All pathways converge at the C3 convertase, which initiates the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Together these MAC proteins form pores in the membrane of biological threats, such as bacteria, to lyse the cell. However, MAC formation is not the only result of complement signaling. For instance, complement tags can also promote the opsonization of toxic molecules and pathogens, whereas soluble complement cleavage products can act as leukocyte chemoattractants [44].

Within tauopathies, not only are there genetic risk loci in complement-associated genes [45]-[47], but dysregulated complement signaling is also a common hallmark of tauopathy disease progression in both patients and animal models [48]-[51]. FTD patients harboring pathogenic MAPT variants are known to have higher levels of C1q expression relative to age-matched controls [51]. Likewise, PS19 mice also display increasing amounts of C1q expression with worsened neurodegeneration. Here, the C1q expression was found to be localized to post-synaptic densities that also contained high quantities of p-tau [50]. Preliminary work has attempted to target some of these cascades by leveraging C1q-blocking antibodies. While this C1q blockade strategy has proven to improve synaptic health, it failed to resolve the deficits in neuron electrophysiological function [50]. These results suggest the need for earlier interventions as synaptic clearance is not driving circuitry dysfunction, but the excessive tau burden is.

Recent studies have also begun to uncover pivotal roles for C3 signaling in tau-mediated disease progression. In these studies, it was shown that genetic deletion of either C3 or C3aR in the PS19 tauopathy mouse model ameliorates both neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation [48],[49]. C3 cleavage and the generation of C3a and C3b is known to drive potent proinflammatory signaling following C3aR engagement. The induction of STAT3-dependent cytokine production downstream of C3aR can also lead to increased activation of tau-associated stress kinases, tau hyperphosphorylation, and subsequent tauopathy (Fig. 2B) [49]. However, future studies are needed to directly test this hypothesis. Moreover, preclinical studies are also needed to interrogate the efficacy of targeting the C3/C3aR axis to limit tauopathy pathogenesis.

Inflammasome

Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that generally consist of three major components: (i) an intracellular receptor such as AIM2, NLRC4, NLRP1, NLRP3, and PYRIN; (ii) the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC); and (iii) the enzyme Caspase-1. Inflammasome activation can occur in response to various discrete PAMPs and DAMPs, and is characterized by the release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 via Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores. This inflammatory pathway is carefully regulated by a coordinated two-step process that involves a priming step and an activation step. The priming step is needed to upregulate the levels of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and the inflammasome sensors. Activation of the sensor orchestrates the assembly of the inflammasome receptor, ASC, and pro-Caspase-1 into a multiprotein complex. The formation of this signaling platform spatially orients pro-Caspase-1 to allow for its autocleavage and subsequent activation. Once activated, Caspase-1 can then go on to cleave and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and GSDMD. Active GSDMD oligomerizes and forms pores in the membrane, and if enough pores form the cell will undergo a form of cell death known as pyroptosis. Bioactive IL-1β and IL-18 can then leave the cell via these GSDMD pores or following lytic cell death [52].

Inflammasome signaling has been recently reported to play a significant role in propagating tau-mediated pathology. Microglia are believed to be the source of pathological inflammasome signaling in many neurological diseases [53]. Inflammasome priming is accomplished via TLR signaling through MyD88 and NF-κB upon continued stimulation with pathological tau, as seen in both tau mouse models and primary microglia cultures [54],[55]. Inflammasome activation is thought to rely on the internalization and degradation of tau within microglial lysosomes [56]. When explored in multiple distinct tauopathy mouse models, the presence of NLRP3 or the adaptor protein, ASC, was shown to exacerbate p-tau burden and cognitive deficits [54],[56],[57]. The inflammasome-dependent cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, are also known to activate neuronal tau kinases and increase p-tau burden in both human in vitro studies and in vivo animal models [58]-[61] (Fig. 2C). Therapeutic strategies to inhibit either NLRP3 or IL-1R have shown encouraging experimental results in rescuing tau-mediated pathology in mouse models [56],[61],[62]. These collective findings suggest that inflammasome signaling is a key driver in tauopathies. However, additional studies are needed to ascertain if dysregulated inflammasome signaling alone can initiate tauopathy.

CX3CR1 Signaling

CX3CR1 is a Class A G-coupled protein receptor responsible for sensing fractalkines. This receptor is almost exclusively expressed on cells of the macrophage lineage, and only microglia within the brain parenchyma [63], making it an attractive promoter in microglia-specific murine knockout studies [64]. It has one known ligand, fractalkine (CX3CL1), which is expressed on neurons and found in two forms: a 95 kDa mucin-like stalk and a secreted 70 kDa fragment (sCX3CL1) [63]. CX3CR1 signaling induces two relatively distinct signaling states in microglia. Firstly, microglia are kept in a quiescent state when CX3CR1 senses membrane-bound fractalkine [65]. Throughout the aging process, membrane-bound fractalkine declines, resulting in more reactive microglia at older ages [66].

CX3CR1 signaling is an important player in tauopathies due to its ability to activate microglia and mediate phagocytosis of tau [67]. Pathogenic tau competes with the downregulated ligand, CX3CL1, in the binding of CX3CR1 in AD brains [68]. In fact, CX3CR1 appears to be required for efficient internalization of tau into microglia [69] (Fig. 2D). Early work found that the genetic deletion of CX3CR1 in hTau mice increased tau burden and other signs of neurodegeneration [34]. Adoptive transfer of CX3CR1-deficient microglia from hTau mice into non-transgenic controls provoked tau spread, relative to transferred microglia with intact CX3CR1, illustrating that disrupted CX3CR1 signaling is sufficient to promote tau fibril aggregation in the absence of other pathology [62]. The loss of CX3CL1 signaling within neurons has also been speculated to be a driver of neurodegeneration, as CX3CL1 expression is often decreased in many tauopathies, including AD [70]. To study this in greater detail, a stable CX3CL1 – C-terminal transgene that can signal without CX3CR1 interactions was expressed in PS19 mice [71]. In these studies, it was found that this modification in CX3CL1 biology could rescue neurodegenerative disease [71]. These data suggest that CX3CL1 alone can promote the neuroprotective effects of this cascade (Fig. 2D). Complementary work also demonstrated that interactions between CX3CR1 and sCX3CL1 can induce neuroprotection in tauopathy mouse models. More specifically, it was shown that overexpression of sCX3CL1 rescued p-tau burden and neuronal loss [72],[73]. Together, these reports suggest that therapeutically targeting and returning CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling to homeostatic levels could offer an effective clinical intervention to treat tauopathies.

Autophagy

Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular waste removal system. There are three major classes of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (Fig. 3). Macroautophagy consists of three steps: initiation, elongation, and maturation. Upon inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or activation of AMPK, the ULK complex and PtdIns3K/BECN1 complex sequester lipids to form phagophores. Elongation relies on many Atg family proteins and MAP 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) which form and wrap the double membrane around the target. LC3 is a common marker for autophagy as LC3-II is associated with autophagosomes and autolysosomes whereas its precursor, LC3-I, is generated in an early macroautophagy step [74]. Maturation occurs when the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome to make the autolysosome [75]. Microautophagy is classified as direct invaginations of the lysosomal membrane to engulf cytoplasmic material. CMA is unique in that it requires the recognition and binding of KFERQ motifs by Hsc70 which then stimulates its uptake into the lysosome via LAMP2a interactions. Importantly, all three pathways work to decrease protein waste, process intracellular antigens, and mitigate inflammation through lysosome digestion [76].

Mounting evidence implicates key roles for autophagy in tau-mediated pathologies [77]-[79]. For instance, multiple key autophagy-related genes have been linked to an increased risk of developing tauopathies in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) [47],[80]-[84]. Moreover, p-tau colocalization with autophagic and lysosomal markers as well as defects in lysosomal integrity are often seen in the brains of familial AD, CBD, and PSP patients [85]. It is well established that soluble tau protein can be degraded through all types of autophagy. However, pathogenic tau can disrupt these autophagy systems and this often leads to inefficient degradation of tau [86]-[88]. Moreover, pathogenic tau destabilizes the MT railway that is required for the retrograde transport of autophagosomes to the soma of neurons, thus constraining fusion with lysosomes and limiting autophagy [83] (Fig. 2E). Additionally, autophagy can at times rely on ESCRT proteins for complete maturation, meaning autophagosomes may fuse with multivesicular bodies (MVBs), as ESCRT proteins are concentrated on its membrane [89] (Fig. 3). MVBs house intraluminal vesicles, the precursors to exosomes, which are heavily implicated in tauopathy progression [90]-[92]. The fusion and eventual exposure to the degradative lysosomal environment means that autophagy also clears one of the major pathology seeding factors, which can further help to control tau-mediated disease propagation [75].

In addition to clearing tau, autophagy can also influence tauopathy pathogenesis through its ability to mitigate pro-inflammatory immune responses [93]. In Aβ amyloidosis models of AD, impaired autophagy was observed to provoke microglial activation and tau hyperphosphorylation, and this was thought to occur as a result of impaired clearance of Aβ plaques and receptor recycling [94],[95]. Likewise, autophagy can limit lipid droplet accumulation [96], allowing for improved lipid homeostasis and reduced pro-inflammatory activation of microglia [97] (Fig. 2E). More investigation into this process is required in a pure tauopathy system, but virology studies in microglia, the resident macrophage of the brain described below, have illustrated that autophagy can clear damaged mitochondria, reducing the release of ROS and other DAMPS, ASC specks, and pro-IL-1β [93]; all of which are implicated in driving tau-mediated pathology.

mTOR is an upstream regulator of autophagy and other metabolic pathways [98]. Given the importance of autophagy events in tauopathies, mTOR signaling is highly implicated in tau pathogenesis. In brief, mTOR activity is believed to be detrimental to tau pathology [99]. For example, mTOR can increase GSK3β activity and decreases autophagy, as measured through LC3-I and LC3-II expression [100]. GSK3β is a major driver of cell-cycle and metabolism pathways, but can also cause hyperphosphorylation of tau [101]. mTOR activity has also been implicated in the alteration of many other key tau kinases and phosphatases in neuronal cultures [102]. Consistent with a pathogenic role for mTOR in tauopathies, mTOR activation correlates with greater tau pathology in AD patients [103]. These results have led the field to turn to treating tauopathy models with mTOR inhibitors, like rapamycin [104]. Indeed, treatment of PS19 tau mice with these drugs was shown to increase autophagy, reduce GSK3β activity, mitigate neuropathology, and improve overall cognition [105],[106]. Likewise, mTOR-independent stimulation of autophagy via trehalose treatment also recapitulated many of the same beneficial outcomes in tauopathy mice [107]. These promising preclinical findings suggest that targeting autophagy may offer an effective strategy to combat tauopathies.

CELLULAR RESPONSES

The brain parenchyma is widely thought to be an immune-privileged organ, walled off from the periphery by a set of barriers that limit immune infiltration. Within the parenchyma exists the neurovascular unit (NVU), which refers to the cellular interactions between the brain and the penetrating parenchymal blood vessels. On the cellular level, the NVU is comprised of brain endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes [108].

During tauopathies, these barriers degenerate and weaken due to an infiltration of tau into perivascular spaces. This has been observed in tauopathy patients, as well as mouse and rat models using chemical penetrance [109], microbleeds [110], and immune cell infiltration [111] as readouts. Although it is not yet clear whether tau is directly toxic to the endothelial cells or if it disrupts the NVU indirectly by acting on the glial cells which help to fortify this barrier, there is common consensus that leaky barriers accompany tauopathy progression [112]. Interestingly, the role of increased peripheral immune cell diapedesis into the brain has been investigated as a potential target for therapeutics as endothelial cells upregulate integrins like intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and selectins on their basal membranes [111],[113].

Neutrophils

Of the peripheral innate immune cells that could be implicated in the pathogenesis of tau-mediated disease, the most likely candidate is neutrophils. Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte in the body, circulating in the bloodstream until they either are cleared or infiltrate into tissues using leukocyte adhesion cascades. Interestingly, many of the same epithelial ICAM and selectin molecules used by neutrophils to infiltrate the CNS are also upregulated on the basal membrane of brain epithelium in tauopathies [114], which could help to explain their presence in the brain during disease. Within the CNS compartment, neutrophils respond to pathogens, damaged structures, and protein aggregates through phagocytosis, degranulation, or release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [115].

The work surrounding the role of neutrophils in tauopathies has largely been conducted in experimental settings involving both Aβ and tau pathologies. For instance, in 3xTG-AD mice, which develop both Aβ amyloidosis and tauopathy, it was found that disease severity directly correlates with the levels of neutrophil infiltration into the brain [116]. Moreover, it was reported that inhibition of the chemoattractant, TNFα, reduced CNS infiltration by neutrophils and tau burden [117]. These two studies indicate that some of the AD pathology in 3xTG-AD mice, whether direct or indirect, could potentially be attributed to neutrophils. However, neutrophil knockdown studies are still needed to further validate this. Additionally, the complement system byproducts, C3a and C5a, are chemoattractants for neutrophils (Fig. 2C). Knowing how highly upregulated complement signaling is in tauopathies, this could be a likely candidate for neutrophil recruitment [118]; however, future studies are also required to probe this idea.

Microglia

Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the brain. They are derived from the fetal yolk sac, enter the CNS before the blood-brain barrier is sealed, and self-renew to maintain their population. Microglia vary in their morphology, transcriptome, and cellular density throughout the brain. Microglia constantly survey their environment and engage upon the sensing of DAMPs and PAMPs. Historically, activated microglia were classified into two classes: M1 and M2, representing the pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, respectively. However, the field is shifting away from such binary nomenclature as ‘omics’ studies are highlighting the spectrum of microglial identities that exist [119].

Within tauopathies, microglia have diverse, and at times, disparate roles in disease progression. On the one hand, their ability to phagocytose tau aggregates, apoptotic neurons, and other debris is thought to be beneficial in limiting tauopathy progression. However, much of the literature surrounding microglial activation also highlights their detrimental roles in tauopathies [120],[121]. For instance, studies inhibiting CSF-1R or treating mice with clodronate liposomes, both of which drastically deplete microglia, saw impaired tau seeding, improved pathology, and less neuroinflammation. The authors of this study went on to show that microglial phagocytosis of pathogenic tau, either from PS19 mice or P301L adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections, lead to the release of exosomes filled with tau seeds capable of inciting prion-like spread of tauopathy [90]. Interestingly, isolated human and mouse microglia have been shown to house tau seeds and secrete them when cultured in vitro, illustrating the incomplete digestion of tau that can occur in microglia [122],[123]. Likewise, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by activated microglia, such as those downstream of NF-κB signaling [124], has also been shown to promote subsequent stress kinase cascade activation and tau phosphorylation within neurons [125]-[127] (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a detrimental role for microglia in driving tauopathies, the dampening of in vivo microglial activation with either minocycline or FK506 drug treatment has also been reported to ameliorate tauopathy pathogenesis in mouse models [128]-[130].

In neurodegenerative diseases, microglia are described to take on a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype. This transcriptional signature is characterized by the upregulation of ‘activation’ markers such as CLEC7A, AXL, and CD11c, and the concomitant downregulation of homeostatic markers such as TMEM119 and P2YR12. The DAM phenotype was originally defined in mouse models of amyloidogenic AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and aging [131]. However, more recent studies show that aged PS19 mice and tau-stimulated cultured microglia also display DAM signatures relative to controls [124]. The DAM phenotype is further broken down into stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 2 DAMs are dependent on signaling through Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), a microglia-activating receptor [131]. While DAM have been extensively studied in other neurodegenerative diseases, far less is known about their roles in tauopathies. As such, future studies are needed to decipher how canonical DAM-associated genes contribute to tau-mediated diseases, as this may open up new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

TREM2 Signaling in Tauopathies

As suggested by its name, TREM2 is expressed on cells within the myeloid lineage, including microglia [132]. These cells can respond to TREM2 ligands, which include lipid derivatives like LPS, phospholipids, lipoproteins, APOE and APOJ, apoptotic neurons expressing phosphatidyl serine, myelin, and Aβ [133]-[138]. Upon ligand engagement, TREM2 signals through DAP12 and activates spleen tyrosine kinase leading to macrophage and microglial activation [139]-[141].

Recent GWAS findings, along with exome sequencing, have exposed several variants of TREM2 to be strongly associated with AD diagnosis and increased rates of cognitive decline [142]-[145]. Of the known TREM2 variants, the histidine to arginine switch at position 47 (R47H) variant, is the one most highly associated with increased AD risk [144],[146]-[148]. There is also strong clinical evidence linking TREM2 mutations to primary tauopathies like PSP, FTD, and their associated mouse models. Of note, FTD has been linked to the following TREM2 variants: T66M, Y38C, Q33X, and R47H [142],[144],[149]. Additionally, TREM2 is highly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in the substantia nigra of PSP patients relative to healthy controls. These TREM2 expression patterns were further shown to positively correlate with intraneuronal p-tau levels [150]. This relates to work that highlights TREM2 as a correlative biomarker for heightened p-tau levels and lowered cognition in AD [151],[152] but not in FTD [153].

TREM2 Signaling in Tauopathy Mouse Models

Due to its importance in the stage 2 DAM transition, GWAS implication in AD, and ability to activate microglia, TREM2 signaling has been widely hypothesized to play a significant role in tauopathies. To date, there have been only a handful of reports characterizing the role that TREM2 plays in mouse models of tauopathy (Table 1). Four such studies have utilized the PS19 mouse model. One group found that TREM2 signaling is detrimental as seen by the reduced neurodegeneration, synaptic protein loss, gliosis, inflammatory markers, and microgliosis in PS19 mice lacking TREM2 or carrying loss-of-function alleles [154],[155]. Both reports by this lab implicate TREM2 as being an antagonizing receptor in tau-mediated pathology. An independent second group described that partial loss of TREM2 in Trem2+/− PS19 mice led to increased tau burden and neurodegeneration when compared to PS19 controls [156]. This complicates the original idea that TREM2 activity is detrimental across disease hallmarks. Interestingly, when TREM2 was overexpressed in CD11b+ macrophages in the brain which include microglia, via a CD11b-directed lentivirus, tau pathology, inflammation, and stress kinase activity diminished, and this led to subsequent improvements in overall disease pathogenesis [157]. This directly contrasts with previous studies in this PS19 tauopathy model, where the loss of microglial TREM2 signaling was beneficial [154],[155], further emphasizing a need for additional investigation into mechanisms of action.

Additional murine models have also been employed to delineate the roles of TREM2 signaling in primary tauopathies (Table 1). On the P301L background, TREM2 knockout did not have any effect on pathology [158]. Moreover, when TREM2-deficient mice were intracerebrally injected with AAV-P301L tau, they experienced increased tau pathology due to failed intracellular vesicle sorting that subsequently resulted in increased exosome release and tau seeding throughout the brain [92]. In hTau mice, TREM2 deletion was found to cause worsened p-tau burden and lead to the activation of a variety of stress kinases including p-JNK, p-GSK3β, p-ERK1/2, and p-P38 [159]. Overall, genetic models of primary tauopathies have been useful in the exploration of basic disease mechanisms; however, additional work is needed to clarify the complex pathogenic molecular cascades and functions downstream of TREM2.

CONCLUSION

The clinical and experimental evidence linking the activation of the innate immune system to the onset and progression of tauopathies is vast and continuing to grow. This collective work has shown that various arms of the innate immune response including TLRs, the complement cascade, the NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy, and TREM2 can become activated in response to either pathogenic tau aggregates and/or DAMPs generated from tau-associated neuropathology. The cumulative pro-inflammatory response generated from these innate immune pathways can then trigger unchecked activation of tau kinases and a subsequent cascade involving tau hyperphosphorylation, tau tangle formation, and neuronal dysfunction.

This emerging work linking dysregulated innate immunity to tauopathy progression has sparked increasing interest in the potential of targeting the innate immune system to treat various tau-associated diseases. Early efforts to explore this in preclinical tauopathy mouse models have shown that pharmacologically and genetically targeting C1q [50], NLRP3, IL-1R [34],[61],[62], autophagy [100],[104]-[107], and microglia activation [128]-[130] can all lead to significant improvements in neurodegenerative disease. Despite these promising early findings, more thorough investigation is required before translating these results into clinical interventions. Most notably, additional studies are needed to interrogate the efficacy of targeting these innate immune pathways in secondary tauopathies that are characterized by tau pathology as well as the deposition of additional neurotoxic aggregates such as TDP-43 and Aβ. Furthermore, future studies are also needed to decipher how discrete isoforms and confirmations of tau engage with the innate immune system. Most tauopathy cases in humans are sporadic in nature, meaning that they are not linked to MAPT mutations. In contrast, most murine models of tauopathies are driven by a mutant MAPT transgene. It has been documented that mutant and wild-type tau have different mechanisms of spreading throughout the brain [160], further emphasizing the need for future work to characterize the potential differences in the immune response to different species of tau.

Figure 1: Inflammation provokes aberrant regulation of tau signaling.

Clinical and murine studies have illustrated that the pro-inflammatory responses, indicated by the blue coloring on the right panel, following immune challenges act upon tau kinases (GSK3β, Cdk5, MAPKs) within neurons, leading to the increased phosphorylation of tau and MT disruption. The phosphatase PP2A normally functions to limit tau hyperphosphorylation but is inhibited by these inflammatory cascades.

Figure 2: Innate signaling cascades implicated in tauopathy progression.

Illustrated is the immunological interface of a microglia (tan) and a neuron (blue) during tau-mediated pathology. A. Activation of TLRs by tau, LPS, or PolyI:C stimulates MyD88 and TRIF signals that result in increased NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) signaling. Both pro-inflammatory signaling pathways can promote aberrant tau kinase activity via pro-inflammatory cytokine release (blue spheres). The subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation is detrimental to neuronal health. B. C1q opsonization will clear tau-burdened synapses. C3 signaling within microglia provokes proinflammatory signaling that can lead to dysregulated tau kinase activation. C3a and C5a can act as chemoattractants for neutrophils that are commonly found within tauopathy brains. C. Tau internalization by microglia can promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation and lead to the cleavage of Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) and release of IL-1β and IL-18 which can subsequently provoke aberrant regulation of tau kinase cascades. D. Tau competes with soluble CX3CL1 (sCX3CL1) for binding with CX3CR1. Tau, however, has a high affinity for CX3CR1 making it able to be internalized, activate microglia, and induce the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CX3CL1 decreases with tauopathy disease progression and the lack of CX3CL1 stimulation at the surface of the neuron prevents pro-survival signaling through PI3K/AKT. E. Microglial autophagy normally functions to clear inflammatory agents and maintain lipid homeostasis. However, tauopathies can be accompanied by impaired autophagy which can cause the microglia to fill with lipid droplets and become pro-inflammatory. Autophagy also helps to clear toxic tau species from neurons. Microtubule (MT) disruptions can lead to impaired neuronal autophagy and subsequent pathogenic tau accumulation.

Figure 3: Autophagy in tau-mediated neurodegenerative disease.

Highlighted in grey boxes are autophagy pathway events commonly altered in tauopathies. Phagophore formation (1) allows for the clearance of tau aggregates, and potentially other inflammatory agents within the cell. Many GWAS studies have uncovered tauopathy disease risk loci in genes involved in phagophore formation (1) and maturation into autophagosomes (2), such as those found within the ULK1 complex. mTOR activity is increased in the brains of both tauopathy mouse models and tauopathy patients. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin slows neurodegeneration in tauopathy mouse models. Microtubule (MT) disruption in neurons prevents autophagosome retrograde transport and eventual fusion with lysosomes (3), which can lose membrane integrity during pathology. Multivesicular bodies may fuse with maturing autolysosomes (4), clear any intraluminal vesicles, and prevent exosome release. Autophagy results in the successful clearance and degradation of engulfed tau tangles (5).
