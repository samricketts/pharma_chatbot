Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 50-60% of cases and affecting nearly 6 million people in the United States. The prevalence is projected to increase to 14 million people by the year 2050.1 Despite its prevalence, the diagnosis of AD remains difficult since clinical symptoms are often nonspecific. Definitive diagnosis requires either antemortem brain biopsy or postmortem autopsy. However, clinical neuroimaging has been playing a greater role in the diagnosis and management of AD, and several positron emission tomography (PET) tracers approach the sensitivity of tissue diagnosis in identifying AD pathology. This review will focus on the utility of PET imaging in the setting of cognitive impairment, with an emphasis on its role in the diagnosis of AD.

Pathophysiology of AD

In 1906, Alois Alzheimer first described the two neuropathologic hallmarks of AD: amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques are extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain parenchyma, and neurofibrillary tangles are intracellular hyperphosphorylated paired helical filaments of tau protein.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis remains the most widely accepted theory to explain the pathogenesis of AD, with the deposition of Aβ plaques in the brain inciting a pathological cascade that leads to neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment. This hypothesis has formed the basis of the 2018 “ATN” research framework of AD, put forth by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association.2 “ATN” reflects three stages of disease, with “A” representing Aβ deposition, “T” tau deposition, and “N” neurodegeneration. Histopathological literature has described characteristic patterns of spread of Aβ and tau. Aβ has been shown to deposit in the neocortex early, before spreading to the allocortex, diencephalic nuclei, striatum, cholinergic nuclei of the basal forebrain, brainstem, and finally cerebellum.3 On the other hand, neurofibrillary tangle deposition begins in the transentorhinal cortex, before spreading to the hippocampus and association neocortex,4 closely tracking synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. Neurofibrillary tangles typically spare the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices until late in the disease course.

Neuroimaging techniques by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET have been developed to track the ATN stages in vivo. In addition, as the complexity of AD has come to light, other PET tracers have been developed to explore synaptic function, cholinergic function, dopaminergic function, and neuroinflammation.5

Clinical Standard-of-Care Neuroimaging

MRI

When a patient presents with cognitive symptoms, clinical standard-of-care typically begins with structural MRI to exclude a potentially treatable condition, although uncommon. A 2003 meta-analysis found that 0.9% of dementia cases were secondary to a reversible etiology, with 0.6% of cases successfully reversed.6 Diagnostic considerations for partially or fully reversible dementias may include brain masses, chronic subdural hematomas, adverse drug effects, depression, alcohol use, and systemic endocrine and nutritional deficiencies. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is another potentially reversible cause of cognitive impairment, characterized by a classic triad of ataxia, urinary incontinence, and dementia. MRI findings of NPH include an acute callosal angle, disproportionate ventricular enlargement, gyral crowding at the vertex, and enlarged Sylvian fissures (Fig. 1).7 When identified early, symptoms can be responsive to ventricular shunt placement.

Beyond excluding reversible causes of cognitive impairment, MRI can also be useful in identifying brain atrophy, particularly of the hippocampi, which are commonly affected early in AD. Qualitative MR assessment of hippocampal atrophy can be supplemented with quantitative metrics, such as measuring hippocampal volumes with FDA-approved software such as Neuroquant (https://www.cortechs.ai/products/neuroquant/), Neuroreader (https://brainreader.net/) and Icometrix (https://icometrix.com/). Using such software packages, hippocampal volumes from the patient can be compared to a database of normal controls, matched for age, sex, and intracranial volume. However, there is evidence that visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy has similar accuracy as quantitative hippocampal volumes,8 and volumes alone do not have high enough accuracies to diagnose AD.9 One meta-analysis of 33 studies and almost 4000 subjects found that hippocampal volumes had a pooled mean sensitivity and specificity of 73% and 71% respectively for diagnosing AD.9 Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe had a pooled mean sensitivity and specificity of 64% and 65%, and lateral ventricular volumes had a pooled mean sensitivity and specificity of only 57% and 64%.

FDG-PET

18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is another noninvasive imaging modality commonly used to diagnose AD. FDG-PET assesses cerebral glucose metabolism, which is typically decreased in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporoparietal cortex in AD,10 due to decreased synaptic density and function. A meta-analysis of 119 studies from 1990 to 2010 showed that FDG-PET has a high accuracy in differentiating AD from normal controls, with 90% sensitivity and 89% specificity, compared to 83% sensitivity and 89% specificity by MRI.11 In clinical practice, FDG-PET is covered by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to differentiate AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in individuals who have had cognitive impairment for more than 6 months. Unlike AD, FTD is characterized by decreased FDG avidity in the frontal and temporal lobes.12

Beyond visually identifying regional patterns of decreased FDG avidity, quantitative assessment of FDG-PET can be useful clinically to detect more subtle areas of hypometabolism. Automated software packages can be used to coregister FDG-PET images to an atlas of normal brain images from individuals in a similar age range (Fig. 2). FDG uptake in atlas-based anatomic regions are then compared between the patient and the normal controls. Z-scores are obtained for each anatomic region, which reflect the degree of decreased FDG avidity in each region, compared to the normal controls. These Z-scores can be used to confirm whether the pattern of decreased FDG avidity is most compatible with AD or FTD (Figs. 3–5). Several papers that have investigated whether automated quantitative methods for assessing regional FDG uptake improve detection of AD have reported an increase in specificities from approximately 58-84% for visual assessment to 87-98% with quantitative assessment.13–15 On the other hand, sensitivities for detecting AD are similar, ranging from 73- 85% for visual assessment and 73-98% for quantitative assessment.

In addition to differentiating AD and FTD, FDG-PET can be useful in diagnosing atypical forms of AD. For example, patients with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), commonly considered the “visual variant of AD,” have decreased FDG avidity in the temporal and parietal lobes, similar to typical AD, but also in the occipital lobes (Fig. 6).16 Involvement of the occipital lobes is typically more asymmetric than in dementia with Lewy bodies (Fig. 7). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Fig. 8) would be another entity to consider with occipital lobe involvement and can be seen concomitantly with AD.17 Patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA), the “language variant of AD,” typically have decreased FDG avidity in the temporal and parietal lobes, but it is typically asymmetric, commonly involving the left hemisphere (Fig. 9).18–21 The other two subtypes of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), nonfluent variant PPA (nfvPPA) and semantic variant PPA (svPPA), are considered clinical syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. On FDG-PET, nfvPPA typically shows decreased FDG avidity in the frontal and parietal lobes, and svPPA shows decreased FDG avidity in the temporal lobe, commonly preferentially involving the left hemisphere (Fig. 10).18

Research PET tracers for neuroimaging AD

Amyloid PET

Since Aβ deposition is one of the neuropathologic hallmarks of AD, the use of amyloid PET using the tracer, 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), in 2002 was a major advancement in the field in allowing for in vivo assessment of Aβ deposition.22 Although its 20-minute half-life limits routine clinical use, due to the need for a cyclotron in proximity, PiB PET remains widely used in AD research studies. Previously, the radiotracer 18F-FDDNP was developed to assess amyloid deposition, but it fell out of favor as it showed an affinity for both Aβ and tau,23 lacking specificity.

Currently, there are 3 FDA-approved 18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, florbetaben (NeuraCeq), florbetapir (Amyvid), and flutemetamol (Vizamyl). A positive scan shows cortical activity that is greater than or equal to white matter, commonly in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as the posterior cingulate gyrus and precuneus, resulting in loss of gray-white differentiation (Figs. 11,12). Because healthy controls can have Aβ deposition for years before developing AD,24 a positive amyloid scan does not definitively diagnose AD. However, a negative amyloid PET scan is useful in excluding AD.

Identifying the presence of Aβ deposition will become even more important as anti-amyloid therapies are being developed. The first, aducanumab (Aduhelm), was FDA approved in June 2021 and is a monoclonal antibody designed to clear Aβ in the brain, in the hopes of slowing the progression of cognitive impairment.25 In clinical trials, the main adverse effects of aducanumab have been termed amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), manifesting as either brain edema (ARIA-E), brain hemorrhage (ARIA-H) or a combination of the two.26 Up to one third of trial patients receiving aducanumab had one of these adverse events, with 10% of patients having symptoms, such as headache, confusion, vision changes, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.27 Amyloid PET scans will be crucial to identify patients with Aβ, who may benefit from this drug, and MR imaging will be crucial to monitoring these patients for edema and hemorrhage.

Tau PET

PET tracers can also be used for in vivo visualization of tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) aggregates, the other pathological hallmark of AD. The only FDA-approved tau tracer is [18F]-flortaucipir (AV-1451, trade name: Tauvid), which is considered a first-generation tau tracer (Fig. 13). In typical amnestic AD, high [18F]-flortaucipir uptake is seen in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and lateral temporal and parietal lobes, with sparing of the primary visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices.28 Unlike amyloid PET, which is typically read as positive or negative, [18F]-flortaucipir uptake correlates with severity of cortical atrophy, allowing for AD staging. The major drawback of the first-generation tracers is off-target binding, especially to the choroid plexus, which can limit accurate quantification of tau deposition in the temporal lobes. Second generation ligands, such as [18F]-MK6240 (Fig. 11) and [18F]-PI-2620, are actively being tested, and early results have indicated decreased off-target signal with improved binding to tau aggregates.28

Of note, several non-AD neurodegenerative diseases are also characterized by tau deposition, including Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. However, [18F]-flortaucipir has been shown to have lower affinity for the non-Alzheimer’s disease tauopathies. On the other hand, [18F]-flortaucipir uptake may be seen in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), typically in the superior and dorsolateral frontal cortex early in the disease process, then later involving the temporal and parietal cortices.29

Future of PET in Dementia

Several new tracers are currently being developed to further characterize pathophysiologic processes underlying dementia using PET.

SV2A (Synaptic Markers)

Loss of normal synaptic density is a well-characterized and consistent pathologic process in AD. Post-mortem evaluation in patients with prodromal or mild AD has identified the hippocampus as the site with the most pronounced synaptic loss, with the degree of synaptic loss corresponding to AD severity.30 PET imaging targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), which is nearly ubiquitous in presynaptic terminal synaptic vesicles, allows for in vivo examination of synaptic density. Early investigations have shown reductions in SV2A binding with the radiotracer [11C]UCB-J in the mesiotemporal and neocortical regions of the brain in early AD patients, which was reduced to an even greater extent than the associated gray matter loss.31 Similar to other 11C PET tracers, the short 20-minute half-life of this tracer limits its use to clinical facilities with onsite cyclotrons. [18F]UCB-H is another radiotracer that targets SV2A, and reduced hippocampal uptake with this tracer, reflective of synaptic loss, has been shown to correlate with cognitive impairment in MCI and AD.32

Neuroinflammation

Neuroinflammation is another key pathophysiologic process in AD, characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes surrounding Aβ plaques. To date, the most well-studied avenue to target activated microglia is via the increased expression of the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO). In the central nervous system, TSPO is primarily expressed in the outer mitochondrial membrane of steroid-producing cells, such as microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, to transport cholesterol into the mitochondria.33 TSPO expression can be assessed with [11C]-PK-11195, considered a first generation TSPO tracer, with increased uptake on PET showing an association with Aβ accumulation in patients with MCI and AD compared to healthy controls.34

First generation TSPO tracers, like [11C]-PK-11195, demonstrate two major drawbacks: their relatively low brain permeability and their high nonspecific or plasma binding, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio.35 To combat these issues, second generation radiopharmaceuticals have been developed, including [18F]-FEMPA,36 [18F]-FEPPA,37 [18F]-DPA-714,38 and [11C]-PBR28.39 However, the second generation TSPO tracers show variable binding affinity that is dependent on an rs6971 genetic polymorphism, meaning a genetic test must be completed before results can be interpreted.40 Other tracers, such as [11C]-deuterium-L-deprenyl (DED), bind irreversibly to monoamine oxidase B, which can be an alternative way of identifying neuroinflammation, since MAO-B is overexpressed in activated astrocytes.40

Cholinergic cell death

Cholinergic cell death underlies both AD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and the degree of cell death strongly correlates with symptom severity.41 Multiple radiopharmaceuticals have been developed to target the cholinergic system, such as [18F]-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV)42 and [18F]-VAT,43 which has high binding affinity for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, a glycoprotein on the membrane of synaptic vesicles of cholinergic neurons. Studies measuring FEOBV tracer activity have found cortical cholinergic degeneration to be proportional to cholinergic basal forebrain atrophy in AD, suggesting FEOBV may have utility in quantifying cholinergic degeneration.42 Early studies have also shown FEOBV to be more sensitive for the detection of early AD than certain amyloid tracers.44 The slow kinetics of FEOBV in the basal ganglia may be disadvantageous clinically, however, as studies may require long scan times.

Dopaminergic targets

Dopaminergic tracers can be used to differentiate AD from DLB. For example, decreased uptake of the radiotracer [18F]FDOPA, a labeled analogue of L-DOPA, has been reported in the putamen in DLB patients compared to AD.45 In one retrospective review of 46 cases of suspected DLB on FDG PET/CT, only 6 were still considered DLB after [18F]FDOPA PET/CT.45 [18F]-FP-CIT is another tracer that can be used to measure striatal dopamine transporter activity. Reduced [18F]-FP-CIT has been reported to correlate with occipital Aβ deposition in patients with DLB, possibly contributing to visuospatial dysfunction in these patients.46

Summary

While FDG PET is the most widely used PET tracer in current clinical practice, there are numerous PET radiotracers that allow us to monitor the pathophysiology underlying AD, such as Aβ deposition, tau deposition, loss of synaptic density, neuroinflammation, cholinergic cell death, and decreased monoamine neurotransmission. Currently, there are 3 FDA-approved 18F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals to assess Aβ deposition: florbetaben (NeuraCeq), florbetapir (Amyvid), and flutemetamol (Vizamyl). These are used in clinical trials, but not yet reimbursed for clinical diagnostic use. [18F]-flortaucipir, used to assess tau deposition in staging AD, is similarly FDA-approved, but not yet used clinically. As more of these PET radiotracers enter mainstream clinical practice, our ability to diagnose, manage, and potentially treat neurodegenerative disease will improve dramatically.

Key Points:

Specific PET tracers allow for in vivo localization of amyloid and tau, the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease

An understanding of the different distributions of decreased FDG avidity can help differentiate typical AD from AD variants and other common neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia

Several new PET radiotracers are actively being researched and show potential in the diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases

Clinics Care Points

Although the imaging evaluation of dementia typically begins with MRI, FDG-PET has higher sensitivity for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease.

Automated software packages that compare a patient’s FDG avidity against a normative database of FDG images from healthy controls can be helpful in improving detection of Alzheimer’s disease.

There are FDA-approved tracers of amyloid and tau, but they are not yet widely reimbursed and therefore typically obtained only in the setting of clinical trials.
