Background:

Midlife cardiovascular risk factors increase risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite disproportionately high cardiovascular disease and dementia rates, African Americans are under-represented in studies of AD risk and research-based guidance on targeting vascular risk factors is lacking.

Objective:

This study investigated relationships between specific cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral perfusion in White and African American adults enriched for AD risk.

Methods:

Participants included 397 cognitively unimpaired White (n=330) and African American (n=67) adults enrolled in the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center who underwent pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI. Multiple linear regression models examined independent relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and mean cerebral perfusion. Subsequent interaction and stratified models assessed the role for APOE genotype and race.

Results:

When risk factor p-values were FDR-adjusted, diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with mean perfusion. Tobacco use, triglycerides, waist-to-hip ratio, and a composite risk score were not associated with perfusion. Without FDR adjustment, a relationship was also observed between perfusion and obesity, cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Neither APOE genotype nor race moderated relationships between risk factors and perfusion.

Conclusion:

Higher diastolic blood pressure predicted lower perfusion more strongly than other cardiovascular risk factors. This relationship did not vary by racial group or genetic risk for AD, although the African American sample had greater vascular risk burden and lower perfusion rates. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize inclusion of underrepresented groups in neuroimaging studies and to continue exploring the link between modifiable risk factors, cerebrovascular health, and AD risk in underrepresented populations.

INTRODUCTION

As the population ages, a dramatic increase is expected in prevalence, cost, and morbidity due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1]. Emerging evidence points toward the confluence of cardiovascular risk factors and cerebrovascular pathophysiology contributing to the clinical manifestation of AD [2]. Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia) present at middle age significantly increase risk for clinical AD and have been proposed as potential targets for AD prevention and treatment [3–6]; even a 5-year delay in AD onset is projected to reduce the prevalence of AD by nearly half [7]. This may be particularly relevant for African Americans who are disproportionately affected by AD[4,8] and often have elevated vascular risk factors[9]. Moreover, African Americans may be disproportionately impacted by socioeconomic disadvantages that also have been implicated in increased risk for dementia and stroke[9–11]. The mechanisms by which vascular risk factors increase risk for AD dementia remain unclear; however, one hypothesis proposes that vascular risk factors contribute to AD-related pathophysiology via blood-brain barrier dysfunction and hypoperfusion[12]. Specifically, vascular risk factors lead to blood-brain barrier dysfunction and a reduction in cerebral blood flow which can reduce amyloid-β clearance at the blood-brain barrier and increase production of amyloid-β from the amyloid-β precursor protein leading to amyloid-β accumulation. Capillary hypoperfusion may induce neuronal dysfunction and can induce hyperphosphorylation of tau leading to neurofibrillary tangle formation. Support for this hypothesis is demonstrated by evidence of perfusion dysfunction in adults at risk for AD via APOE ε4 genotype carriage[13–15] or family history[16], and perfusion disruption prior to AD pathology development in animal models of AD[17].

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising technique for detection and characterization of cerebrovascular health. The main physiological parameter measured by ASL is cerebral perfusion or the delivery rate of oxygen and nutrients to the capillary bed and is expressed as the volume of blood per volume of tissue per minute (mL/100g/min)[18]. Previous studies have reported associations between reduced perfusion and diabetes mellitus 1, hypertension 2, and tobacco use 3. Our prior studies demonstrated that increased age and components of metabolic syndrome or estimated 10-year cardiovascular disease risk score[22] were associated with lower perfusion in a sample of white, late middle-aged adults[23–25].

However, it remains unclear if there are particular cardiovascular risk factors that have a stronger association with reduced cerebral perfusion in midlife and therefore may be more important targets for prevention efforts. Importantly, the unique contributions of specific cardiovascular risk factors to cerebral perfusion have not been explored in racially diverse populations, despite African Americans having a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: 1) investigate the unique relationships between specific cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral perfusion in a racially diverse cognitively unimpaired late middle-aged population, 2) examine if increased genetic risk for AD (APOE ε4 carrier status) moderates relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and cerebral perfusion, and 3) assess within-group relationships between vascular risk factors and cerebral perfusion among African American and White subsamples. .

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants

This study was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Health Sciences Institutional Review Board and the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). The initial sample included data from 406 middle-aged and older adults enrolled in the ADRC Clinical Core. Three participants were excluded due to large metal artifact impacting signal and six participants were excluded due to poor signal-to-noise ratio on ASL, resulting in a final sample of n=397. Participants included in this study were classified as cognitively unimpaired (e.g., no evidence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia) at their baseline study visit by consensus conference panel based on National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria 4,5. Enrollment in the Core targeted individuals whose risk for AD was enriched due to a parental history of AD. Data from participants who self-identified as African American or non-Hispanic White as primary race and completed neuroimaging exams were included in analyses.

Cerebral Perfusion Acquisition and Quantification

MRI scans were completed on a clinical 3T scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) using either a 32-channel (Nova Medical) or 8-channel head coil (Excite HD Brain Coil; GE Healthcare). All participants were instructed to abstain from food, tobacco, and caffeine at least four hours prior to the MRI scan. Cerebral perfusion was acquired using a background-suppressed pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pcASL) sequence6 utilizing a 3D fast spin-echo stack of spiral sequence. Scan parameters were as follows: echo spacing=4.9ms; TE=10.5ms with centric phase encoding; spiral arms=8, spiral readout duration =4ms, FOV=240×240×176mm; 4 mm isotropic spatial resolution; reconstructed matrix size = 128 × 128 × 44; number of averages (NEX) = 3; and labeling RF amplitude = 0.24 mG. Immediately after each ASL scan, a proton density (PD) reference scan was performed with identical imaging acquisition parameters without ASL labeling but with a saturation pulse was applied 2.0 seconds prior to imaging. This proton density (PD) image was used for ASL flow quantification as well as for imaging registration. Cerebral perfusion was quantified based on recommendations from the ASL consensus paper[18]. Specifically, the following equation was utilized: CBF=6000 λ (SIcontrol−SIlabel)ePLD/T1b2 α T1blood (1−e−τ/T1blood)(1−e−ST/T1tissue)SIPD[mlmin 100g]

where T1blood is T1 of blood and is assumed to be 1.6s at 3T. The partial saturation of the reference image (SIPD) is corrected for by using a T1tissue of 1.2s (typical of gray matter). To avoid numerical errors and noise amplification in areas of low proton density, a maximum neighborhood filter was applied to the PD image prior to quantification (per Xu et al., 2010). ST is saturation time and is set to 2s. The partial coefficient λ is set to the whole brain average, 0.9. The efficiency,α , is a combination of both inversion efficiency (0.8) and background suppression efficiency (0.75) resulting in an overall efficiency of 0.6. Post-labeling delay (PLD) was set to 2.025s. Labeling duration (τ) was set to 1.5s. Cerebral perfusion (or CBF) is reported in ml/100gm/min units.

A T1-weighted structural scan (BRAVO) was acquired axially using the following imaging parameters: 3D fast spoiled gradient echo sequence; inversion time 450 ms; repetition time (TR) 8.1 ms; echo time (TE) 3.2 ms; flip angle 12 acquisition matrix 256 256; field of view (FOV) 256 mm; and slice thickness 1.0 mm. The T1-weighted volume was segmented into tissue classes using Statistical Parametric Mapping Version 12 (SPM12, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) segmentation procedure to produce gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) probability maps. The GM tissue mask was smoothed and each participant’s PD image was coregistered to their smoothed T1-weighted GM image using an affine transformation procedure. The derived transformation matrix was applied to the ASL map. Each scan was visually inspected to confirm that the registration between the two scans was accurate; no subjects were excluded due to poor registration. The GM mask (thresholded at 0.3) was applied to the perfusion image to limit analyses to voxels with greater than 30% probability of containing gray matter and mean perfusion was computed across all voxels within the GM mask. Example perfusion images from this sample are depicted in Supplemental Figure 1. The primary outcome measure used in all analyses was mean GM cerebral perfusion.

Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Cardiovascular risk factor data were acquired during the physical examination at the WADRC clinical core study visit closest in time to the MRI scan date (mean = 3 months difference between study visit and MRI scan). Predictor variables included fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), HDL cholesterol (HDL-c), fasting glucose, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and systolic and diastolic blood pressures, tobacco use (binary: current or former smoker vs. never smoker), tobacco exposure (total years smoked multiplied by the range of cigarettes/packs smoked daily [1 cigarette to &lt;1/2 pack, 1/2 pack to &lt;1 pack, 1 pack to &lt;1.5 packs, 1.5 packs to &lt;2 packs, or ≥2 packs]), and a composite vascular risk score (ACC/AHA atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) 10-year risk score 7). Blood pressure was measured up to three times within an examination visit to obtain a stable measure, with the participant seated using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Waist circumference was measured with an anthropometric tape to the nearest centimeter with the participant standing. The waist circumference was taken at the level of the natural waist (narrowest part). Waist measurements were taken twice by trained staff, and the smallest measurement was used. All models included covariates of age at MRI scan, sex, years of education, genetic risk for late-onset AD (APOE ε4 carrier status), antihypertensive medication use, and self-reported presence/absence of diabetes. Additionally, post-hoc analyses substituted reading level (National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test [28]; available for n=348 participants) for years of education as prior studies suggest reading level may provide a more precise estimate of educational quality and thus better reflect potential socioeconomic status differences across racial groups[29].

Statistical Analyses

All analyses were performed in R version 3.5.1[30]. The relationships between vascular risk factors and mean perfusion (Aim 1) were examined using multiple linear regression models. Each model included one cardiovascular risk factor as a predictor (systolic or diastolic blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides, fasting glucose, tobacco use, tobacco exposure, or ASCVD 10-year score), along with covariates for age, sex, years of education (or alternately reading level), APOE genotype (ε4 carrier vs. non-carrier), diabetes, and antihypertensive medication use, with mean cerebral perfusion as the outcome variable. Any model using tobacco exposure only included former or current smokers (never smokers were excluded), in order to focus in on differing exposure amounts without the large point mass of no smoking history, which is approximately 2/3rds of the subjects. To help address the multiple comparisons, the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to risk factor results, at 5% false discovery rate control (FDR), to reduce the potential for Type 1 error.

A separate procedure compared the relative importance of 11 of the 13 vascular risk factors (fasting glucose and tobacco exposure were not included in models due to smaller sample sizes) through a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) backwards selection procedure. The starting model contained these 11 risk factors along with the other 6 covariates listed above (e.g., age, sex); covariate reduction was restricted to the set of 11 risk factors.

To test the hypothesis of APOE genotype moderating relationships between risk factors and cerebral perfusion (Aim 2), identical multiple linear regression analyses were conducted with the addition of an interaction term between APOE ε4 carrier status (ε4 carrier vs. non-carrier) and the vascular risk factor of that model. To assess race-associated risk and potentially unique relationships between vascular risk factors and perfusion within African American and White samples (Aim 3), race was added as a covariate to Aim 1 models, and the new models were fit for the pooled sample. Then, the pooled sample was stratified by race and race-specific Aim 1 models were fit. To test for a difference in risk factor associations by racial group, the risk factor coefficients in race-specific models were compared and the difference quantified. Inference on this difference was conducted using non-parametric bootstrapping, sampling subjects with replacement within each stratum separately before refitting stratified models and comparing the risk factor coefficients. 2,000 iterations were performed for each difference analysis and the bootstrap percentile method was used to construct 95% confidence intervals around the difference estimates. Including a race-by-APOE interaction was also considered for inclusion when models included the race covariate. However, the interaction was non-significant in all but one of the risk factor models, and since the fundamental interpretation of this interaction is the same for all models, we chose not to include this interaction in any of the models presented here.

Regression diagnostics were performed for all models. Moderate non-normal residuals were observed for all models (i.e., Q-Q plots of residuals had right skew). Cook’s distance yielded no concerns of influential points and residuals analysis did not indicate outliers. A moderate concern for increasing variance in models using fasting glucose were observed. Standard transformations of the response were examined, but these did not improve the above concerns; as such untransformed variables were used for all analyses. Raw relationships between perfusion and each risk factor were examined, and no major concerns for non-linearity were noted.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics

Table 1 summarizes cardiovascular risk factor prevalence across the whole sample and within racial groups. Participants were mean age 61.9 (8.7) years old, more likely to be female, completed post-secondary education, and about a third were APOE ε4 carriers. About 14% of the sample self-reported diabetes and about 30%were taking an antihypertensive medication. The sample included 17% (n = 67) African Americans and 83% (n = 330) Whites. No differences were observed between African Americans and Whites on age, sex, years of education, or APOE genotype.

Relationships among Vascular Risk Factors and Mean Perfusion

Regression results are displayed in Table 2. Age (all models), sex (92% of models), APOE genotype (46% of models), and diabetes (69% of models) were significantly associated with cerebral perfusion, whereas years of education and antihypertensive medication use were not significantly associated with perfusion.

For uncorrected results, significant relationships were observed among mean perfusion and diastolic blood pressure (P&lt;0.001), waist circumference (P=0.03), BMI (P=0.008), LDL-c (P=0.028), HDL-c (P=0.033), and fasting glucose (P=0.024). Relationships between mean perfusion and systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, waist-hip ratio, tobacco use or exposure, or the composite vascular risk score (ASCVD) were non-significant (all P&gt;0.0.68). Adjustments to control the false discovery rate (FDR) over these 13 comparisons resulted in only one model retaining a statistically significant relationship with perfusion: diastolic blood pressure (FDR-corrected P=0.013). The models including BMI, LDL-c, HDL-c, and fasting glucose were no longer significant following FDR correction.

The BIC reduction procedure retained only diastolic blood pressure out of the 11 risk factors. Supplemental Table 1 displays the results for the order that risk factors were removed from the model, with systolic blood pressure being removed first, and HDL cholesterol being removed last.

Relationships among APOE and Vascular Risk Factors on Mean Perfusion

The interaction of APOE genotype × vascular risk factors was non-significant across all models (all uncorrected P&gt;0.19), indicating that the relationships between vascular risk factors and perfusion did not vary based on APOE carrier status. F-tests comparing models without APOE main effect or interaction to models with the main effect and interaction terms were also non-significant (all P&gt;0.05).

Relationships among Race and Vascular Risk Factors on Mean Perfusion

African Americans exhibited higher vascular risk values and lower perfusion compared to Whites (see Table 1). For example, African Americans had higher self-reported prevalence of diabetes (37% compared to 9%), antihypertensive medication use (62% compared to 25%), and tobacco use (55% compared to 32%), as well as elevated risk factors observed on physical exam (e.g., higher blood pressure, measures of obesity, cholesterol, fasting glucose) and overall 10-year risk for cardiovascular event (18% vs. 10%).

When race was added to models, the main effect of race was significantly associated with perfusion in all models (all P&lt;0.04), indicating that African Americans exhibited lower perfusion than Whites after adjustment for covariates. Furthermore, with race included in the models, the cardiovascular risk factors were no longer significantly related to perfusion, with all FDR-corrected P values &gt;0.1; diastolic blood pressure, BMI, LDL-c, HDL-c, and fasting glucose all had significant uncorrected P values (see Table 3). In separate models fitted for African American and White subgroups, there were no significant relationships between any vascular risk factor and perfusion after FDR-correction. In uncorrected results, diastolic blood pressure, LDL-c, tobacco use, and tobacco exposure were associated with perfusion in Whites; no risk factors were associated with perfusion in African Americans (see Table 4). The raw, unadjusted relationships between diastolic blood pressure and cerebral perfusion among Whites and African Americans is depicted in Figure 1, with a Generalized Additive Model trend to account for any raw non-linearity. Despite between-group variation in statistical significance, bootstrapping procedures revealed no evidence for racial group differences in relationships between the vascular risk factors and perfusion. The confidence intervals for race-specific model estimate differences all contained zero.

A post-hoc analysis examined if results varied with substitution of reading level for years of education as a covariate in the models. Despite similar educational attainment in years, reading levels were lower in African American than in White participants. In these models, reading performance did not account for a significant amount of variance in perfusion in the majority of the original models (P values ranged from 0.22–0.78) nor in the models that included the main effect of race (P values ranged from 0.51–0.99), even though the race main effect was still consistently significant (12/13 models, uncorrected). These results indicate that substitution of a measure of reading level for years of education failed to account for racial differences in perfusion in this sample.

Sensitivity Analyses

Due to change in MR hardware during the study, 68% of the sample (n=268) had data acquired with an 8-channel MRI head coil and 32% of the sample (n=129) with a newer 32-channel head coil. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess whether similar results were observed in the 8-channel and 32-channel samples. Results of these sensitivity analyses showed that diastolic blood pressure exhibited a statistically significant relationship with perfusion in the sample scanned with the 32-channel head coil (uncorrected P=0.001, FDR-corrected P=0.017); whereas, this relationship was non-significant in the 8-channel head coil sample (uncorrected P=0.220, FDR-corrected P=0.466). No other risk factors exhibited significant relationships with perfusion after FDR-correction in the 8- or 32-channel coil samples (See Supplemental Table 2).

Race group differed by head coil (32-channel coil was used on n=86 [26.1%] of the White sample compared with n=43 [64.2%] of the African American sample). When both head coil type and race were included in the models, the main effects of both race (P values&lt;0.05) and coil type (P values&lt;0.002) were significantly associated with perfusion in models for ASCVD score, total cholesterol, and tobacco use. The main effect of head coil (P values≤0.003), but not race, was significantly associated with perfusion in models for blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), waist circumference, waist hip ratio, BMI, LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides, and glucose. Diastolic blood pressure and BMI were the only risk factors that remained significantly associated with perfusion (uncorrected) when both race and head coil were included in models (Diastolic blood pressure: β= −0.13, P=0.050; BMI: β= −0.22, P=0.034); no risk factors remained significant after FDR correction. These results indicate that head coil type significantly associates with the outcome measure of perfusion, but that diastolic blood pressure and BMI exhibited significant relationships with perfusion after accounting for the effect of coil type.

DISCUSSION

In a well-characterized sample of 397 middle-aged and older African Americans and Whites, we observed relationships between cerebral perfusion and diastolic blood pressure, obesity (waist circumference and BMI), cholesterol (LDL and HDL), and fasting glucose. After correction for multiple comparisons, only diastolic blood pressure was significantly associated with perfusion, and there was no evidence for relationship heterogeneity by APOE ε4 status. Although African Americans exhibited higher vascular risk factors and lower perfusion rates, relationships between risk factors and perfusion did not significantly differ between these subgroups.

The current findings on elevated diastolic blood pressure and perfusion are consistent with prior studies that report relationships between high blood pressure and lower perfusion in cognitively healthy elderly samples[20,31–33]. In midlife, higher blood pressure has been found to be associated with lower perfusion in an AD mouse model[34] and with longitudinal decline in perfusion in a middle-aged adult sample[35]. Typically, cerebral autoregulation helps to maintain a constant level of cerebral perfusion with fluctuations of blood pressure through adjustment of cerebral arteriole resistance[36]. However, with long-term hypertension or frequent fluctuations in blood pressure, arteriosclerosis may affect the cerebral autoregulation resulting in hypoperfusion. Maintaining adequate perfusion is essential for providing oxygen and nutrients to brain tissue and neurons; reduced perfusion may increase risk for dementia and dementia due to AD by inducing early neuronal dysfunction and increasing production of beta-amyloid from the beta-amyloid precursor protein[12]. We did not observe relationships between genetic risk for AD and perfusion, but prior studies in a large racially diverse cohort (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; ARIC) found that elevated arterial stiffness was associated with increased cerebrovascular and AD pathology (e.g., amyloid-β)[5] suggesting possible connection between vascular disease and development of AD pathophysiology.

Vascular risk factors were more prevalent among the African Americans in this sample compared to their White counterparts, as seen in previous reports [9]. However, a composite vascular risk score (ASCVD 10-year risk estimate) was not associated with perfusion, which differs from our prior findings in a smaller, predominately White sample that was otherwise similar to the current participant group[24]. These results echo prior findings that Framingham stroke risk composite score significantly predicted perfusion in a primary sample but not within a more diverse validation sample[38] and the current findings are consistent with another study that did not find a relationship between Framingham scores and perfusion [39]. Composite scores may be useful in gauging overall vascular risk factor load, but may obscure the salience of individual cardiovascular markers for cerebrovascular health, particularly in racially diverse populations.

We observed that African American race predicted lower rates of cerebral perfusion independent of vascular risk load. A small body of work suggests that African Americans may exhibit lower cerebral perfusion prior to onset of other vascular symptomatology, even during young adulthood [40]. Given the strong negative relationship between age and perfusion reported here and elsewhere, our finding that African American race is an independent predictor of lower perfusion may also be consistent with studies suggesting that African Americans experience the onset of age-related morbidity earlier than their White counterparts. The “weathering hypothesis” developed by Geronimus and colleagues[46] is strongly implicated in cardiovascular health disparities[47] and suggests that premature deterioration is a consequence of physiological dysregulation provoked by accumulated exposure to social disadvantage over the life course. In support of this hypothesis, Hackman and colleagues recently demonstrated that life course socioeconomic position was positively associated with global and regional cerebral perfusion[48]. Relatedly, within African American cohorts, measures of adult literacy have been utilized as a proxy for quality of education and other influential early life exposures, and are a powerful explanatory factor for racial disparities in later-life cognitive function[29]. In this sample, we did not find that observed racial differences in educational attainment or quality (e.g., reading level) associated with perfusion or accounted for the racial differences in perfusion. These results suggest the possibility that increased risk for AD in African Americans may be related to earlier disease secondary to end-organ damage (e.g., lower cerebral perfusion) associated with chronic, long-term vascular risk factors. However, there are important limitations that can impact the race-specific results from this study. First, hardware change during data collection for this study (e.g., 8-channel to 32-channel head coil) was unfortunate as differences in signal-to-noise ratio between coils increased variability in our perfusion estimates. The relatively high collinearity between coil type and race (greater proportion of data from African Americans were collected using 32-channel coil) introduces a degree of uncertainty to conclusions about racial differences in perfusion. Secondly, there is recent evidence that hematocrit differences by sex and race/ethnicity can influence the quantification of perfusion estimates from ASL [49]. Unfortunately, we did not measure individual hematocrit or relaxation time of blood (T1blood) in this sample and therefore used a fixed T1blood estimate[17] in our perfusion quantification. Third, while our African American sample is growing, relatively small numbers still limit our power to detect significant relationships within this group and examine within-race social and vascular health gradients. It will be important to replicate these findings in larger samples and explore mechanisms underlying perfusion differences.

Finally, the current study’s sample characteristics and design constrain generalizability and causal inference. The sample is enriched for AD risk, and sampling on a family history of AD may impact generalizability despite our findings that the most well-established heritable risk factor for AD, APOE ε4, is not a key moderator of relationships between risk factors and perfusion. We also were not able to assess the role for timing as a modifier of relationships between vascular risk and perfusion. There is evidence that midlife may be a sensitive period for risk[50], while some markers such as hypertension and elevated diastolic pressure may actually be protective in late life, and future studies should continue integrating a life course approach to these questions[51]. Finally, there are constraints on our statistical conclusions. Our necessary adjustment for multiple comparisons increased the probability that associations between risk factors and perfusion may not have been detected. Specific processing procedures and model selection choices (e.g., examination of mean instead of regional perfusion, no partial volume correction due to lack of significant atrophy expected) are important to consider when comparing these results to other studies. Finally, this study was cross-sectional and included vascular risk factor data from just one point in time (e.g., visit closest to MRI scan); therefore, these results do not confirm hypotheses about associations between longitudinal trajectories of vascular risk factors and perfusion which will need to be investigated in future studies. Future work must also explore relationships between vascular risk factors and additional neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular health (e.g., white matter hyperintensities, ASL spatial coefficient of variation (CoV)), as well as cognitive decline and impairment.

Despite limitations, this study contributes to a growing body of literature exploring systemic vascular risk factors as markers of cerebrovascular health, and suggests elevated diastolic blood pressure may be an important prevention target for maintaining cerebrovascular health in middle-aged and older adults. Inconsistent findings between cohorts and within-cohort samples point to the importance of considering data collection and processing strategies as well as sample demographic distributions, particularly age and race, in interpretation of results. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize inclusion of African Americans and other underrepresented populations within cognitive aging study cohorts, and to continue exploring the link between potentially population-specific modifiable vascular risk factors, cerebrovascular health, and AD and other dementia risk.
