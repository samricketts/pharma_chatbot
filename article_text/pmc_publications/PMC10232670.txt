Introduction:

Distinguishing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patient subgroups may optimize positive clinical outcomes. Cortical atrophy is correlated with memory deficits, but these associations are understudied in American Indians.

Methods:

We collected imaging and cognition data in the Strong Heart Study (SHS), a cohort of 11 tribes across three regions. We processed 1.5T MRI using FreeSurfer and iterative principal component analysis. Linear mixed models estimated volumetric associations with diabetes.

Results:

Over mean 7 years follow-up (N = 818 age 65–89 years), overall volume loss was 0.5% per year. Significant losses associated with diabetes were especially strong in the right hemisphere. Annualized hippocampal, parahippocampal, entorhinal atrophy were worse for men, older age, diabetes, hypertension, stroke; and associated with both encoding and retrieval memory losses.

Discussion:

Our findings suggest that diabetes is an important risk factor in American Indians for cortical atrophy and memory loss. Future research should examine opportunities for primary prevention in this underserved population.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Precision medicine refers to the emerging practice of tailoring risk, prognosis, or treatment decisions based on individual patient characteristics. Distinguishing patient subgroups in complex, heterogeneous diseases may optimize positive clinical outcomes; applying such a model to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is especially promising.1 AD, characterized by cerebral accumulation of beta-amyloid fragments and pathologically phosphorylated neurofibrillary tau, results in inflammation, neuronal loss, synaptic degeneration, tissue atrophy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and ultimately death.4 However, emergence, timing, and presentation of AD symptoms can vary,2–4 and so presence and staging of AD pathology is most reliably assessed objectively,5 with imaging and biofluid biomarkers.6–9

Identification of highly specific biomarkers is critical for successful application of a precision medicine paradigm. A conventional in vivo standard for neurodegeneration is structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can be enhanced by quantitative image analysis to identify tissue atrophy in AD-selective regions, including hippocampus, para-hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex.6,10,11 In AD, imaging measures of cortical atrophy have been correlated with both tau deposition and AD-symptomatic cognitive deficits.9 AD-affected regions include hippocampus and parahippocampal and entorhinal cortices in the temporal lobe.6 Atrophy of such medial temporal structures are specific to prodromal AD,7 and AD dementia.8 However, equitable representation of all populations, including racialized minorities, in AD research is essential to successful development of precision medicine protocols, in order to ensure that all key, distinguishing characteristics are considered and fairly evaluated.12

In the United States, more than 3 million American Indians, Alaska Natives, African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, Asians, and Pacific Islanders suffer from AD,13 and generally experience earlier onset of cognitive symptoms than non-Hispanic White individuals (NHW).14 Social constructs correlated with race/ethnicity, such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, and perceived discrimination, do not fully explain these observed disparities,15,16 suggesting that race/ethnicity may be important, even if it is not a direct contributing factor. Furthermore, although American Indians are at especially high risk for AD, due in part to high prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus,17–21 the degree to which atrophy in specific cerebral substructures may be related to these conditions or to cognitive status has not been examined in this population.

In this paper, we describe the degree of cortical tissue loss using new measures collected in a longitudinal study conducted over 10 years in American Indians from three geographic regions, and we examine associations of these longitudinal imaging features with vascular and AD risk factors and with cognitive testing for memory. We used FreeSurfer software to process 1.5T cranial MRI for continuous volume estimation of 34 distinct cortical regions and structures, and used intraindividual Iterative Principal Component Change Analysis (IPCA) to estimate voxel-wise whole brain atrophy. We estimated quartiles of atrophy in regions known to have strong predictive capacity for AD, and evaluated their association with risk, clinical, and cognitive features. Future analyses will be able to examine central and subcortical regions, cortical thickness, and other related measures. These descriptive analyses of overall, region-specific, and association analyses with clinical and cognitive features of AD are a first step in identifying markers of potential value in precision medicine, with specific benefit for an underserved population.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Study setting

The Strong Heart Study (SHS) originally recruited American Indians age 45–75 from 13 tribes and communities near study field centers in the U.S. Northern Plains, Southern Plains, and Southwest, representing approximately 67% of the eligible population.22 The original SHS (1989–1991) and follow-up examinations (1993–1995; 1997–1999) focused on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, with 85%–87% successful recruitment between visits. In 2010–2013 and again in 2017–2019, an ancillary study, the Cerebrovascular Disease and its Consequences in American Indians (CDCAI) study, conducted two sequential follow-up visits among survivors from the original SHS, with focus on vascular and Alzheimer’s dementias, and with similar recruitment success.23,24 The CDCAI study examination visits both involved 1.5T structural MRI, detailed cognitive testing, and clinical examination. This study sample has been previously characterized in detail, with respect to cognitive test score distributions; formal test psychometrics are ongoing.25

2.2 | MRI volumetric measures

Our MRI collection and processing protocols have been previously described in detail.24,26 In brief, six sequences were obtained in contiguous slices, including sagittal T1-weighted localizer, co-registered axial-T1, axial-T2, axial-T2* susceptibility-weighted images in the anterior commissure/posterior commissure plane, axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and sagittal T1-weighted volumetric gradient echo. Semi-automated software processing used version 5.3 of the FreeSurfer image analysis suite and IPCA software.27–30 We estimated structural volumes after skull stripping using cortical reconstruction by voxel-based parcellation of T1 images,31 which produces continuous volumetric estimates in units of mm3 for each region and for the whole brain, for each participant and at each study visit. FreeSurfer data are used in analyses to estimate change between visits. IPCA is a voxel-based longitudinal analysis of sequential co-registered MRI T1 images over sequential visits to characterize total atrophy across the whole brain for each participant.32 IPCA uses a linear relationship in paired voxel intensities to identify a distance threshold that optimizes the trade-off between small volume changes while accounting for global intensity changes, such as the confounding effects of between-scan shifts in voxel intensity, and provides a total continuous estimate of percent atrophy for each participant between study visits.

2.3 | Missing data

The overall number of participants in the 2010–2013 CDCAI visit was 818; of these, 20 (2.4%) did not complete MRI. The overall number of participants in the 2017–2019 follow-up CDCAI visit was 403; of these, 51 (12.6%) did not complete MRI. Reasons for failure to complete MRI included contraindications, frailty, claustrophobia, or refusal. Among the 798 and 352 MRIs, respectively, 17 (2.1%) and 47 (13.3%), respectively, had technical errors including image interference, incomplete sequence, excess motion artifact, inadequate field of view, or failure during FreeSurfer quality control. Overall, n = 781 (2010–2013) and n = 305 (2017–2019) MRIs were available for our analyses.

2.4 | Other measures

At both visits, participants underwent the same clinical and cognitive examinations conducted by trained staff at each field center. Age (years) was calculated from birth date. Sex, years of formal education, current and lifetime alcohol and tobacco use, history of stroke, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were self-reported. Self-reported stroke had sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%, correct classification 92% compared with adjudicated case definition in previous analyses.33 Hypertension was defined as self-reported history or use of medications or averaged seated systolic blood pressure &gt; 139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 89 mmHg. Diabetes was defined as self-reported history or use of insulin or medications or fasting plasma glucose &gt; 126 mg/dL. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was assessed by measure of height and weight. The California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd edition short form (CVLT-II) tested verbal learning and memory, commonly associated with losses in the medial temporal lobe, including free recall (uncued recall 30 seconds after learning trials), long recall (uncued recall 10 min after learning trials), and cued recall (after long free recall).

2.5 | Statistical analyses

Descriptive analyses include tabulation of count and percent or central spread of distribution such as mean and standard deviation for sociodemographics, clinical, neurological, and imaging features. Annualized change in volumetric features estimated by FreeSurfer was calculated for each individual as difference in volume between visits, divided by the time between visits. Categories of annualized atrophy in FreeSurfer-estimated cerebral volumetric features included hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex, with left and right hemisphere combined. Annualized change for these features was categorized into quartiles, to approximate graded features, for example, medial temporal lobal atrophy (aka Schelten’s) score;34,35 entorhinal cortex atrophy (aka ERICA) score;36 and parahippocampal atrophy score.37 Risk features associated with quartiles of annualized atrophy were calculated based on data taken at the time of Visit 1, including sex, age, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and prior stroke. Cognitive sequelae associated with quartiles of annualized atrophy were calculated based on data taken at the time of Visit 2, including CVLT-II scores. These CVLT scores were summarized as indices of memory, including encoding: short (30 s) free recall and long (10 min) free recall trials; storage: percent of the short free recall score that is lost by the time of the long free recall trial; and retrieval: percent of absolute loss between short and long trials that is then recovered by semantic cues. Means with 95% confidence interval for volumetric measures were estimated based on comparison to a normal distribution. Graphical representations included histograms of IPCA estimated percentage loss in whole brain, scatterplots of IPCA over age with quadratic polynomial fit, boxplots of IPCA over education, and boxplots of quartiles of annualized change in FreeSurfer estimated brain regions. Descriptive estimations of percent change in each brain region, was calculated separately by hemisphere. Exploratory regression models of continuous volumetric features for diabetes mellitus, by hemisphere, were structured as linear mixed models, with fixed effect indicator variables for field center and random effects from age, sex, year of education, current alcohol use, ever tobacco use, and BMI. Correction for multiple testing used calculation of “Q-value” based on estimation of false discovery rate.

3 | RESULTS

The mean time elapsed between the two CDCAI visits was 6.7 years (SD 1.1; range 3.8–9.2). As previously reported, this cohort is primarily female, and characterized by high BMI and a high prevalence of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.23 Participants who only contributed to the first examination visit were, on average, 3 years older and 7% more likely to report diabetes than those who later participated in the follow-up (Table 1). Distributions by field center, years of education, and BMI did not differ according to examination visit. Among participants who completed both visits, characteristics were consistent over time, with the exception that they were more likely to be hypertensive at the second visit. Mean cortical thickness, brain volume, entorhinal volume, parahippocampal volume, and hippocampal volume were similar between both groups at Visit 1, but lower at the follow-up visit; mean surface area was consistent across all groups.

Mean intraindividual percent change in overall brain volume using iterative principal component analysis (IPCA, units: %), was 0.54 (95% CI 0.51–0.57) for the entire cohort, 0.55 (SD 0.27) for the 211 females, and 0.52 (SD 0.24) for the 94 males (p = 0.35). IPCA scores visualized by sex using histograms (Figure S1), showed similar distribution for males and females. Mean IPCA among participants was 0.56 (SD 0.28) in the Northern Plains; 0.50 (SD 0.24) in the Southern Plains; and 0.64 (SD 0.28) in the Southwest (p = 0.04); distribution across field centers appeared similar by visual examination (Figure S1). IPCA was not correlated with age (pairwise coefficient: 0.08); or with years of formal education (pairwise coefficient: 0.07). Scatterplot for age and boxplots for education visually confirm these statistical findings; IPCA intercept with age was 0.7% volume loss per year, with a flat (coefficient ~0) polynomial spline over the range of age (Figure S1).

Annualized IPCA, categorized into quartiles, had no clear association with age, BMI, stroke, and hypertension; but persons with diabetes were more likely to have the most extreme atrophy (Table 2). Visit 2 CVLT-II short recall scores were worst among those in the most extreme atrophy quartile; and cued rescue scores were best among those in the least atrophy quartile. There was no clear association with long (10 min) recall or with percent loss between short and long trials, with overall brain atrophy.

Annualized hippocampal atrophy, categorized into quartiles (Figure S2), was worst among men, older ages, and persons with diabetes; but with no clear association with BMI, hypertension, or stroke (Table 3). Visit 2 CVLT-II scores in short recall, long recall, percent of score loss between short and long trials, and percent of lost score rescued by cues were worst among those in the quartiles of most hippocampal atrophy.

Annualized parahippocampal atrophy, categorized into quartiles (Figure S2) had no clear association with age, BMI, diabetes, or hypertension (Table 4); males and participants with prior stroke were more likely to have the most parahippocampal atrophy. Although no clear differences were detected in visit 2 CVLT-II scores across quartiles of parahippocampal atrophy; dose-dependent patterns were observed for percent loss between short and long-free recall, with the poorest performance among those with the most atrophy.

Annualized entorhinal atrophy, categorized into quartiles (Figure S2), was not clearly associated with age or BMI, and associations with sex and diabetes were non-linear (Table 5). Participants with hypertension or prior stroke were more likely to have worse atrophy in entorhinal cortex than participants without these conditions. Visit 2 CVLT-II short and long free recall scores were worse among the quartiles with worst entorhinal atrophy; but percent of score loss between short and long recall trials, and percent of lost score rescued by cues did not have a linear association.

In exploratory analyses, percent change per year for brain structures in the left and right hemispheres demonstrated that most individual regions declined significantly in volume, on average, by 1%–2% per year. The steepest declines were (Table S1, alphabetically): cuneus, entorhinal, fusiform, inferior temporal, lateral orbito-frontal, lingual, medial orbito-frontal, parahippocampal, pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, superior temporal, frontal pole, temporal pole regions – all with &gt; 2% loss per year.

Examining differences in persons with diabetes, overall IPCA was not substantively different comparing participants with (mean 0.53, SD 0.27) to those without diabetes mellitus (mean 0.55, SD 0.26). Linear mixed models of left hemisphere volumes, comparing persons with diabetes to those without (Table S2), banks of the superior temporal sulcus, anterior cingulate, entorhinal, and temporal regions all had coefficient associations exceeding 0.5% loss per year, but these associations did not survive adjustment for multiple testing. These models included fixed effect for field center and random effects for age, sex, education, current alcohol use, and lifetime tobacco use. Identical models of right hemisphere volumes (Table S2), occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal regions (including inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate) all had associations exceeded 0.5% loss per year. Of these, medial orbito-frontal (β: −0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −1.3, −0.2), para-hippocampal (β: −1.4, 95% CI: −2.3, −0.4), pars triangularis (β: −0.9, 95% CI: 1.6, −0.3), posterior cingulate (β: −1.0, 95% CI: −1.7, −0.3), precuneus (β: −0.8, 95% CI: −1.3, −0.3), and rostral middle frontal (β: −0.7, 95% CI: −1.2, −0.3) were statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing (false discovery rate Q &lt; 0.05).

4 | DISCUSSION

This study describes the nature and extent of overall brain atrophy and substructure volumes over time in a cohort of older American Indians. Annualized volume loss for gray and white matter combined did not differ by age, sex, or field center but was worse for persons with diabetes. Annualized hippocampal atrophy was worse for men, older age, and diabetes. Annualized parahippocampal atrophy did not differ by age, but was worse for men, hypertension, and stroke. Annualized entorhinal atrophy did not differ by age or sex, but was worse with diabetes, hypertension, and stroke. These annualized measures of atrophy were associated with standard and novel CVLT-II learning and memory scores, including metrics summarizing the ability to retain information over time, standardized to baseline trial performance and the ability to rescue performance by use of semantic cues. These conventional and novel metrics provide indices of encoding, storage, and retrieval facets of memory, with hippocampal atrophy associated with all aspects of loss, but parahippocampal cortex atrophy with encoding and entorhinal atrophy with retrieval. Our findings also suggest that diabetes may be a significant risk factor for cortical tissue atrophy in regions often associated with AD, especially hippocampus, and is strongly associated with both encoding and retrieval type memory losses.

A small study of NHW estimated IPCA losses of 0.52% per year among AD patients and 0.41% in normal cognition controls, with excellent discriminability.32 Among our participants aged 65 and older, we detected an average volume loss of approximately 0.5% per year over an average of 7 years. These findings suggest that American Indian elders may have substantially greater degree of atrophy and annualized volume loss compared with White individuals, more consistent with atrophy observed among AD patients. However, it is unclear whether our findings reflect AD type pathology; vascular injury; inflammation; neural injury from comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus; or other pathological processes.

Brain regions involved in memory formation and retrieval exhibited especially extensive loss, especially those typically affected by AD, such as hippocampal, parahippocampal, entorhinal, as well as superior temporal, and frontal pole regions. Overall atrophy was not significantly different by field center (geographic region), sex, age, or education, suggesting that other influences may influence atrophy and neurodegeneration; or that such associations may be specific to subregions and not detectable in overall measures of whole brain atrophy.

Our findings identified particular risk exposures that have been identified as especially problematic for AD, notably diabetes.38 Presence of diabetes was consistently associated with losses in brain regions affected by AD, and especially strongly associated with losses in the right hemisphere. The medial orbito-frontal cortex (decision making), para-hippocampal gyrus (limbic, memory formation and retrieval), pars triangularis (motor aspect of speech), posterior cingulate cortex (limbic, memory, default mode network), precuneus gyrus (episodic memory, visuospatial processing), and rostral middle frontal cortex (literacy, numeracy) were all significantly affected by diabetes status (Table S3). After adjustment for multiple testing, we observed losses that were 0.7%–1.4% greater per year among participants with diabetes than among persons without diabetes. Two previous, small studies reported lower volumes in gray matter, hippocampus (medial temporal), amygdala (medial temporal), putamen (basal ganglia), and thalamus among people with diabetes and prediabetes than among normal glycemic controls,39,40 consistent with the patterns observed in our study.

Our analyses were consistent with prior reports defining a 4-point entorhinal cortical atrophy (ERICA) score, wherein more extreme atrophy in the entorhinal cortex had high discriminant capacity for identifying AD dementia from normal cognition.36 The entorhinal cortex modulates memory, learning, and perception, and is the primary interface between the hippocampus and neocortex.

We also observe that left and right averaged hippocampal volume in the primarily NHW (93%) Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, was 3.5–3.7 mm3; notably, this cohort includes the entire spectrum of AD pathogenesis, with 28% having normal cognition.6 In a small, Finnish study of cognitively-normal, European White adults at risk for AD, total hippocampal volume was approximately 7 mm3.41 In our study, total hippocampal volume (Table 1) was 6.5–7.0 mm3, and average left and right hippocampal volume was 5.0 mm3, lower than values observed in at-risk White populations but higher than values observed in a White AD patient population. A multi-ethnic cohort study reported mean total brain volume about 12e5 mm3, comprising half each of gray and white matter;42 in our study, total brain volume was somewhat lower, at 9.5e5 mm3.

Among the many strengths of this work are the detailed, objective clinical examinations and rigorous measurement protocols. Also, this unique, population-based cohort of an understudied population provides an innovative examination of the potential for several metrics of possible utility in precision medicine for AD. This study also has some notable limitations. First, our analyses examining cognitive sequelae only examined one measure of learning and memory, which was proposed a priori based on expected associations. However, other cognitive domains may also be associated with structural atrophy, either in these or in other brain regions. Future analyses should examine other cognitive domains, including visuospatial, executive, attention, set switching, fluency, and processing speed. Second, we were unable to directly examine diagnosis of MCI or dementia; efforts to establish normative and impairment standards for cognitive tests and to adjudicate impairment by physician panel based case review are underway, allowing future analyses to examine discriminant performance for regional brain atrophy for these conditions. Third, we did not include evaluation of apolipoprotein (APO)Ee4 carrier status, which although predictive of higher AD risk in NHW,43,44 is not associated with either imaging or cognition measures in this population.45 Fourth, selective survival may have caused the sickest participants to be lost to follow-up, removing them from our longitudinal analyses, limiting our ability to detect risk associations. As a descriptive report, our analyses are less likely to be impacted in this manner. However, some associations may be stronger than the estimates reported herein. Although these data include some self-reported data, prior analyses of this population have demonstrated self-report to be an accurate representation of true disease status.33

Several directions for future research are suggested by these findings. First, characterization of the overlap of vascular and AD risk and imaging characteristics are needed for this population, especially given the elevated presence of risk features.46–48 To improve AD patient risk stratification, other groups should also confirm our indirect findings that American Indian elders have a greater degree of atrophy and annualized volume loss than other racial/ethnic groups. To maximize the potential for primary prevention target, new investigations may expand on these findings by examining associations with modifiable or behavioral risk features.38,49 To formally characterize cognitive status, ongoing work by physician panel will adjudicate MCI and dementia in this study population, which will support future inferential associations with imaging and other biomarkers. Finally, exploring therapeutic interventions, including psychological, social, and community features that may improve cognitive resilience and delay or prevent development of AD or vascular dementia, may ameliorate some observed disparities, with potential to benefit American Indians and other Indigenous communities throughout the US.50 Overall, this work represents a first step in evaluating detailed volumetric biomarkers associated with AD and vascular aging in an understudied population.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review:

A prior study of non-Hispanic White individuals (NHW) estimated annual volume loss 0.5% in AD patients and 0.4% in normal controls.28 Medial temporal atrophy reportedly has high discriminant capacity to separate AD dementia from normal cognition.30 Previous studies reported lower volume in medial temporal and basal ganglia among persons with diabetes.32,33

2. Interpretation:

Estimated mean annual brain volume loss is 0.5%, suggesting atrophy rate in American Indians may be higher than for NHW, although the source of this disparity is unclear. We detected associations of extreme atrophy in entorhinal, parahippocampal, hippocampal regions with memory dysfunction, consistent with other populations. We also detected associations of diabetes with atrophy in frontal and medial temporal lobes, consistent with prior studies.

3. Future directions:

Future research should examine opportunities to reduce neurological disparities, such as from diabetes, for secondary and tertiary prevention of AD in underserved populations.
