Working memory refers to the temporary retention of a small amount of information used in the execution of a cognitive task. Working memory impairments are one of the common hallmarks of many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated Fischer 344 and Long-Evans rats for strain and sex differences in working memory using the operant-based DNMTP task. Rats were required to press one of two levers presented during a sample phase and followed by a 2–32 second delay, the rats were then required to press the opposite, nonmatch, lever during the choice phase. We found a transient strain difference with Fischer 344 rats performing better than Long-Evans early in training. The Fischer 344 strain showed stable performance across sessions while the performance of Long-Evans increased in the later sessions. Since different background rat strains are used for transgenic rat models, it is critical to be able to compare the behavioral performance across different strains. These findings have implications in behavioral neuroscience research as understanding the typical behavioral endpoints in different background strains will aid our understanding of how different models affect behavioral performance.

pmc1. Introduction

Working memory refers to the online retention and manipulation of a small amount of information to guide behavior during a cognitive task (Baddeley 1992). The Fischer 344 strain is the background strain of a transgenic rat model developed to recapitulate age-dependent increase in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and memory deficits (Cohen et al. 2013; Rorabaugh et al. 2017). Working memory deficits appear in this transgenic rat model earlier than object recognition memory deficits (Munoz-Moreno et al. 2018; Cohen et al. 2013), and working memory deficits are observed in people with mild cognitive impairment and AD (Kirova, Bays, and Lagalwar 2015). Despite being frequently used in aging research (Beas, Setlow, and Bizon 2013; McQuail et al. 2016), the Fischer 344 strain is less often used in tasks assessing the neural circuits mediating cognitive function. In addition, Fischer 344 rats are the least similar in terms of their morphology, sensory and motor abilities compared to other standard laboratory rat strains (e.g. Lewis, Long-Evans, Sprague–Dawley and Wistar rats) used in behavioral neuroscience research (Webb, Gowribai, and Muir 2003). We, therefore, compared the performance of Long-Evans rats with that of Fischer 344 rats to investigate the strain differences using an operant delayed nonmatch to position task (DNMTP), a task often used across species to test working memory performance.

Strain differences in rats have been reported in several measures including unconditioned fear responses (Rosen, West, and Donley 2006), sensory-motor gating (Swerdlow et al. 2004), the ability to recognize sociability in unfamiliar rat strains (Kogo et al. 2021; Kiyokawa, Kuroda, and Takeuchi 2022), juvenile play behavior (Siviy, Baliko, and Bowers 1997; Siviy et al. 2003; Stark and Pellis 2021; Stark et al. 2023), and memory tasks (Josef Van Der Staay and Blokland 1996; Blokland and Sesia 2023). Strain differences may contribute to divergent findings across studies, so it is important to examine different stains in classic cognitive tests. For example, inbred strains performed worse on a spatial learning test than outbred strains (Gokcek-Sarac, Wesierska, and Jakubowska-Dogru 2015). Strain differences in mice have revealed key differences between strains including impulsivity measures (Bailey et al. 2021) and working memory (Estape and Steckler 2002, 2001). However, how different rat strains compare in their cognitive performance is less well studied. The Long-Evans rat strain is typically used in cognitive tasks, including working memory performance measured by DNMTP (Auger and Floresco 2017; Stackman et al. 1997). Indeed, it has been argued that the Long-Evans strain is ideal for many of these tasks because of its enhanced visual acuity aiding its ability to learn visual discrimination tasks over albino strains (Aggleton 1996; Jacobs, Fenwick, and Williams 2001; West et al. 2011). As the arsenal of transgenic rat lines is expanding, it is critical to determine the ideal strain for a given task in order to understand the neurobiological mechanisms of complex behavioral tasks.

One prevailing theory about working memory function in the prefrontal cortex is linked to dopamine modulation (Weber et al. 2022; Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic 1991). However, there are differences in dopamine responses in distinct rat strains and sex (Rivera-Garcia et al. 2020; Weber and Swerdlow 2008). As such, it is important to understand strain and sex differences in tasks that are critical for cognitive processing including working memory. Importantly, working memory has been studied extensively in humans in both sexes, however, there have been inconsistent results depending on the task demands (Harness et al. 2008) likely due to variations in the nature of working memory tests used, the complexity of working memory test, motivation, stress, and/or genetic variation. We used an operant version of the DNMTP in both sexes in two distinct strains to determine if there are inherent differences in working memory in task. The DNMTP task gives us the benefit of testing subjects at desired working memory loads via changing the difficulty of the task (i.e., changing the delay interval) in which specific sex or strain differences can emerge (Reed et al. 2017). Specifically, performance on this task worsens with the increase in the delay period. Additionally, given that working memory impairments are a common feature of AD (Mielke 2018; Ferretti et al. 2018), it is important to test this AD model background strain (F344) in working memory tasks compared to other commonly used strains. Studying strain differences in working memory holds the potential to accelerate the process of drug discovery for diseases affecting working memory.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Subjects

In this study we used 13 male (7 Fischer 344 and 6 Long-Evans) and 12 female (6 Fischer 344 and 6 Long-Evans) rats aged 70–100 days (180–270 grams for the females and 260–370 grams for the males) at the beginning of the study. Long-Evans rats were acquired from Envigo (Livermore, California) and Fischer rats were acquired from Envigo (Livermore, California) or through our in-house breeding colony. All subjects were housed individually and maintained on a standard 12:12 hour light-dark cycle (lights off at 9:00 am). During behavioral training and testing, rats were restricted to no less than 85% of their body weight by food access to 10–25 g (5–6g/100g body weight) of standard rat chow per day (ad libitum water). All animal procedures were approved by the Rowan University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

2.2. Training

We trained rats to perform a delayed nonmatch to position (DNMTP) task according to the timeline represented in Figure 1A. The training was performed in standard Med Associates operant chambers, consisting of two cue lights, two levers below the lights, a food receptacle between the levers for reward (sucrose) pellet delivery, a nose poke receptacle on the wall opposite to levers, and a house light. First rats underwent magazine training, in which a dustless precision sucrose pellet (Bioserve, Flemington, NJ, males 45 mg and females 20 mg) was delivered into the food receptacle pseudorandomly 30 times. After three days of magazine training, the rats were trained to press a lever on a fixed ratio schedule (FR), in which each lever press results in reward delivery. FR1 training consisted of four 15-minute blocks (2 minutes in between blocks). The rats were required to press each lever 50 times during this session to move to the next training stage. Next, rats were trained to self-initiate discrete trials. Here, each trial began with both levers retracted into the chamber and the house light was illuminated. For the levers to be extended into the chamber, the rat had to nose poke at the receptacle in the wall opposite to the levers within 20 seconds. After the nose poke, the house light turned off and one of the two cue lights turned on, and the lever below it was extended into the chamber. One press of the lever (FR1) was followed by a reward pellet delivery within 20 seconds of lever extension. The cue/lever position, left or right, was presented pseudorandomly so that each lever was presented 25 times (50 trials total). Failure to nose poke within 30 s of trial start resulted in the termination of that trial (omission) and the start of next trial. To advance to the next stage of training, the rats were required to complete 45 trials out of 50 total possible trials (&gt;90%). The intertrial interval was pseudorandom and variable (85, 90, 95 s). After rats learned to self-initiate trials, we began delayed non-match to position training (DNMTP) which is shown in the schematic in Figure 1B. First, each trial consisted of three phases i.e., sample phase, delay phase, and choice phase. Each session of this training stage consisted of 50 trials. During the sample phase, the house light was illuminated, and one of the two levers (e.g., right) located below it extended into the operant chamber (left or right position presented pseudorandomly). The rats were required to press the lever for a sucrose pellet to initiate the delay phase. During the delay, all lights were extinguished, and levers were retracted. After the delay, the house light was illuminated, and the rat had to nose poke to initiate the choice phase. During the choice phase, both levers extended into the chamber and the rat was required to press the opposite (i.e., non-match) lever from the sample phase (e.g., left) to obtain a sucrose pellet. Failure to press the sample lever, to nose poke during the delay phase or to press a lever during the choice phase resulted in the termination of that trial recording it as an omission. First, rats were trained with “no delay”; i.e., 1s between sample press and delay phase termination. After the advancement criterion was passed with no delay (&gt;88% correct), the rat was moved to the next stage of training which consisted of 50 trials on the same task except the delay phase was 2 seconds. After the advancement criterion was met (&gt;84 % correct), the rat was moved to the next stage of training which consisted of 50 trials with a 4-second delay. Finally, once the advancement criterion (&gt;84 % correct) was met, the rats were trained on the same DNMTP task with a 6-second delay period. After training on the 6-second delay, rats were moved to the DNMTP test sessions.

2.3. Testing

The rats were tested on three different stages: short delay stage (stage 1), medium delay stage (stage 2), and long delay stage (stage 3). Stage 1 consisted of trials with short delay lengths (2, 4, 8, or 16 seconds), stage 2 consisted of medium delay length (4, 6, 12, and 24 seconds) and stage 3 consisted of trials with long delay length (4, 8, 16, 32 seconds). These delay periods were intermixed pseudorandomly with ~15 trials/delay lengths for a total of 60 trials per session. Like the training phases, each trial in these stages consisted of 3 phases. During the sample phase, the house light was illuminated, and one of the two levers (e.g., right) extended into the operant chamber. The rats were required to press the lever for a sucrose pellet. During the delay phase, all lights were extinguished, and levers were retracted. After the delay (variable interval), the house light was illuminated, and the rat had to nose poke to initiate the choice phase. During the choice phase, both levers extended into the chamber and the rat was required to press the opposite (i.e., non-match) lever from the sample phase (e.g., left) to obtain a sucrose pellet. Rats were tested on multi-delay stage 1 with short delay lengths for ten sessions (i.e., days), medium delay lengths at multi-delay stages 2 for four sessions and long delay lengths at multi-delay stage 3 for four sessions.

2.4. Data Analysis

We calculated Q-Q plots for all of the dependent variables to test for normality in GraphPad Prism 10.0. We found that all dependent variables showed normal disruption with little variability from the y=x line in the Q-Q plots. Thus, all data were analyzed using parametric analysis of variance (Graph Pad Prism or SPSS20) including two or three factors as described in detail below.

We recorded average body weights at each of the stages of training and ran on a three-way mixed ANOVA with stage of training as a within subject factor, and strain and sex as a between subject factors. During FR1 training, we recorded the number of days it took for each rat to reach criterion and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain (Long-Evans and Fischer) and sex (male vs female) as factors. We also recorded the number of presses on the last day of training and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors. For self-initiated trials, we recorded the number of days it took for each rat to reach criterion and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors. For DNMTP with no delay, we recorded the % correct for each rat (choosing the “non-match” lever) in the choice phase. Failure to press the sample lever, failure to nose poke during the delay phase or failure to press a lever during the choice phase was recorded as an omission. We recorded the number of days it took for each rat to reach criterion and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors. For the DNMTP with 6 second delay, we recorded the % correct for each rat (selection of the “non-match” lever) in the choice phase. During DNMTP (both single delay sessions and multi-delay sessions), failure to press the sample lever, failure to nose poke during the delay phase, or failure to press a lever during the choice phase was recorded as an omission. We recorded the % correct on the DNMTP6 session and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors. We measured the latency to press during the sample phase throughout all of the multiple day training sessions and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors.

We examined the % body weight change across the experiment and ran a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors. Finally, we correlated the percent body weight change to our behavioral responses for the sessions in which we observed differences between strain/sex in our above ANOVAs. For DNMTP with multiple delays, we recorded the % correct for each delay on these sessions and averaged for all sessions (1–10 multi-delay stage 1; 1–4 multi-delay stage 2; 1–4 multi-delay stage 3) and ran a three-way mixed ANOVA with between-subject factors, strain and sex, and delay length as a repeated measures factor for trials where the rats made a choice (“choice trials”) and for all of the trials “all trials”. We also calculated the difference between the percent correct for the longest delay and shortest for each animal in all of the stages and ran a two-way ANOVA with sex and strain as factors. As we found no differences between choice and all trials, we only show data from the choice trials in Figures 3–5 but include statistics in the results section. Finally, data were analyzed using signal detection theory (SDT). For all of the days run for the multi-delay sessions, correct responses on the left lever during the choice period were designated a “hit”, while incorrect responses on the left lever were classified as a “false alarm” (Steckler 2001). In this task, a “hit” (h) probability was defined as the number of correct left responses divided by the number of correct left responses plus the number of incorrect right responses. The “false alarm” probability was defined as the number of incorrect left responses divided by the number of incorrect left responses plus the number of correct right responses. Based on these values, we then calculated indices of accuracy [A’ and a Sensitivity Index, SI (Steckler 2001)]. A’ was calculated using the following formula: 0.5 + [(h-f)+ (h-f)2/[4 × h × (1-f)]. SI was calculated using the following formula: [h-f]/[2 x (h+f)-(h+f)2. For both of these indices, a value of 1 represented all correct responses. We ran a three-way mixed ANOVA with between-subject factors, strain and sex, and delay length as a repeated measures factor on hits, false alarms, A’ and SI.

3. Results

3.1. Fischer 344 rats required fewer days to learn to self-initiate trials and are quicker to respond on the sample lever compared to Long-Evans rats.

We examined the number of days required for Fischer 344 and Long-Evans male and female rats to reach criterion for each of the steps of training to move onto the multi-delay DNTMP task (Figure 2). We tracked their weight gain throughout the study. With a mixed three-way ANOVA, we found a significant main effect of stage of experiment (F6,126=57.2, p&lt;0.0001), strain (F1,21=33.3, p&lt;0.0001) and sex (F1,2=129.3, p&lt;0.0001). As expected, males gained more weight than females throughout the study (Stage of Experiment by Sex, F1,21=7.2, p&lt;0.0001) and Long-Evans gained more weight than Fischer 344 rats (Stage of Experiment by Strain interaction, F1,21=6.2, p&lt;0.0001) as shown in Figure 2A. We found that there was no difference between Long-Evans or Fischer 344 rats in the number of days it took to reach criterion for FR1 training (i.e., 50 presses/lever) as revealed by a two-way mixed ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Sex x Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown in Figure 2B. We also found that there were no differences in the number of presses by Fischer 344 (males: 170 +/− 33, females 297 +/− 63) and Long-Evans rats (males: 193 +/− 39, females 218 +/− 19) on the final day of FR1 Training as revealed by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) = 4.04, p=0.058; Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Sex x Strain: F(1, 21) = 1.8, p =0.19). We found that Fischer 344 took significantly less time to reach criterion (&gt;90% trials initiated) for self-initiated trial sessions than Long-Evans rats as shown by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Strain: F(1, 21) = 45.71, p&lt;0.0001); Sex x Strain: F(1, 21) = 3.75, p=0.066) as shown in Figure 2C. We then performed a post-hoc test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison and found Fischer rats were faster than Long-Evans rats in both sexes (male: t21=3.65, p=0.0031, female: t21=6.2, p&lt;0.0001). On the first day of self-initiated trials, we analyzed if omissions in the session were due to a failure to nose poke to begin the choice trial or a failure to press the lever within 20 s following the extension into the chamber. We found that for both Fischer and Long-Evans rats most of the omissions were due to a failure to nose poke (Fischer: 95.8% +/− 1.1%; Long-Evans 89.7% +/− 2.6%). While both strains were more likely to omit the nose poke than the lever press upon extension, there was a significant difference between the Fischer and Long-Evans rats in that Long-Evans were more likely than Fischer rats to fail to press the lever (Fischer: 4.2% vs Long-Evans 10.3%) as shown by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) = 3.18, p=0.089; Strain: F(1, 21)= 5.33, p=0.031; Sex x Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1).

We found that there were no differences between Long-Evans or Fischer 344 rats in the number of days it took to reach criterion on the DNMTP task with 1 s delay (88% correct) as revealed by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) =1.21, p=0.28; Strain: F(1, 21)&lt; 1; Sex × Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown in Figure 2D. On the final day of the fixed delay training session (DNMTP6), we examined the % correct on the final delay session (6s) and found there were no differences between Long-Evans or Fischer 344 rats on performance as shown by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) &lt;1; Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Sex × Strain: F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown in Figure 2E. Finally, we analyzed the latency to press the sample lever throughout multi-stage DNMTP. We found that Fischer 344 took significantly less time to respond on the sample lever (latency to press) than Long-Evans rats as shown by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Strain: F(1, 21) = 10.0, p=0.0047); Sex x Strain: F(1, 21) &lt;1) as shown in Figure 2F.

3.2. Body weight change does not correlate with behavioral performance in either Fischer 344 or Long-Evans rats

We first examined the % change of body weight from the first day of the study compared to the last stage of testing (Multi-delay Stage 3). We found that Fischer 344 rats gained less weight from the start to end of the study compared to Long-Evans rats as shown by a two-way ANOVA with strain and sex as factors (Sex: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; Strain: F(1, 21) = 6.2, p=0.021; Sex x Strain: F(1, 21) &lt;1; Figure 3A). Since the Fischer rats did not gain as much as weight as Long-Evans, we wanted to correlated body weight change with behavioral measures that observed differences between the strains (i.e., trials to criterion for self-initiated trials, Figure 2C and latency to press Figure 2F). We found that while Fischer rats took significant fewer days to reach criterion than Long-Evans (Figure 2C), there was no correlation between the % body weight change during self-initiated trials and days to reach criterion in self-initiated trials within either strain (Figure 3B). In addition, even though Fischer rats are quicker to press the sample lever than Long-Evans rats (Figure 2F), there was no correlation between the % of body weight change during multi-delay testing and latency to press the sample lever during test (Figure 3C).

3.3. Long Evans rats start to decline in performance at earlier delays than Fischer rats on the first stage of DNMTP.

We found a significant interaction between delay and strain (no effects of sex) as shown in Figure 2A–B on stage 1 of multi-delay testing (2,4,8,16s delays) averaged across all 10 sessions. In the choice trials (i.e., only trials in which the subjects selected a choice by pressing either the correct or incorrect lever) and for all trials (i.e., trials in which subjects made a choice and trials with omissions) during stage 1 of multi-delay testing, there was a significant main effect of delay (choice: F(2.649, 55.63) = 97.42, p&lt;0.0001; all: F(2.068, 43.42) = 76.30, p&lt;0.0001), but no main effects of strain (choice: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; all: F(1, 21) &lt; 1) or sex (F(1, 21) &lt;1; all: F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA. Importantly, during this stage, there was an interaction effect of delay and strain (choice: F(3, 63) = 3.245, p=0.028; all: F(3, 63) = 4.242, p=0.0086), but no interaction of delay x sex (choice: F(3, 63) = 1.359l, p=0.26; all: F(3, 63) = 2.352,p =0.081) or sex x strain (choice: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; all: F(1, 21) &lt; 1). We also found that the difference (% correct long- % correct short) between the long delay (16s) and short delay (2s) revealed a main effect of strain (F(1, 21)=5.8, p=0.025), but not sex (F(1, 21) &lt;1), and no interaction (F(1, 21) =2.6, p =0.12) as shown in Figure 3B.

3.4. There were no differences in % correct between Long-Evans and Fischer 344 rats in the later stages of DNMTP (stages 2 and 3).

We found no differences between the two strains or sexes on either stage 2 of DNMTP multi-delay (4s,6s,12s, 24s) averaged across all 4 sessions (Figure 1A) or stage 3 of DNMTP multi-delay (4s,8s,16s,32s) averaged across all 4 sessions (Figure 1A) as shown in Figure 3C–F. Specifically, for percent correct (from both choice trials and all trials) on stage 2 of the DNMTP multi-delay task there was a significant main effect of delay (choice: F(1.816, 38.14) = 62.09, p&lt;0.001; all: F(2.049, 43.04) = 62.67, p &lt;0.0001), but no main effects of strain (choice: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; all: F(1, 21) &lt; 1) or sex (F(1, 21) &lt; 1; all: F(1, 21) &lt; 1 ) as shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA sessions. In addition, there were no interaction effects of delay x strain (choice: F(3, 63)&lt;1; all: F(3, 63) &lt;1), delay × sex (choice: F(3, 63)= 1.335, p=0.27; all: F(3, 63) &lt;1), or sex x strain (choice: F(1, 21) &lt; 1; all: F(1, 21) = 1.959, p=0.17). We found no significant differences in the difference (% correct long- % correct short) between the long delay (24s) and short delay (4s) revealed no main effect of strain (F(1, 21)&lt;1), sex (F(1, 21) &lt;1), and no interaction (F(1, 21) &lt; 1 ) as shown in Figure 4D.

For both the percent correct choice trials and for all trials during DNMTP multi-delay stage 3, there was a significant main effect of delay (choice: F(2.32, 48.73) = 92.34, p &lt;0.0001; all: F(2.346, 49.27) = 77.87, p&lt;0.0001), but no main effects of strain (choice: F(1, 21) &lt;1; all: F(1, 21) = 2.8) or sex (F(1, 21) = 0.34; all: F(1, 21) = 0.002) as shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA sessions (Figure 4C). In addition, there were no interaction effects of delay x strain (choice: F(3, 63)= 2.3, p=0.08; all: F(3, 63) = 1.7, p=0.175), delay x sex (choice: F(3, 63)= 1.05, p=0.38; all: F(3, 63) &lt; 1), or sex × strain (choice: F(1, 21) = 0.28; all: F(1, 21) = 0.42). We found no significant differences in the difference (% correct long- % correct short) between the long delay (32s) and short delay (4s) revealed no main effect of strain (F(1, 21)=1.78, p = 0.20), sex (F(1, 21) &lt;1), and no interaction (F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown in Figure 4D.

3.5. Fischer rats perform better in the early sessions, but not late sessions, on the first stage of DNMTP.

Since we only found that there was significant interaction between delay and strain in the first stage of the DNTMP task, we wanted to determine if there were differences in performance between early session (1–5) and later session (6–10). We analyzed the choice trials only for the first 5 days and the last 5 days of stage 1 of the multi-delay testing (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s). We found a significant effect of delay by strain interaction (but no effect of sex) based on their performance on first half (sessions 1–5) of stage 1 of multi-delay testing (2,4,8,16s delays) as shown in Figure 5A. Specifically, for the first half (sessions 1–5) of multi-delay stage 1 was a significant main effect of delay (F(2.674, 56.16) = 59.05, p&lt;0.0001), but no main effects of strain (F(1, 21) = 1.17, p=0.29) or sex (F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA. Importantly, there was a main interaction effect of delay and strain (sessions 1–5: F(3, 63) = 3.6, p=0.019), but no delay x sex interaction (sessions 1–5, F(3,63) &lt;1) or sex × interaction (sessions 1–5, F(1,21) &lt;1): We found that the difference (% correct long- % correct short) between the long delay (16s) and short delay (2s) revealed a main effect of strain (F(1, 21)=5.9, p=0.024), but not sex (F(1, 21) &lt;1), and no interaction (F(1, 21) &lt; 1) in the first half (sessions 1–5) of multi-delay stage 1 as shown in Figure 5B.

We found no differences in the second half (sessions 6–10) of stage 1 of the multi-delay testing (2,4,8,16s delays) as shown in Figure 5C. Specifically, there was a significant main effect of delay (F(1.994, 41.88) = 49.6, p&lt;0.0001), but no main effects of strain (F(1, 21) &lt; 1), sex (F(1, 21) &lt; 1) as shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA. Unlike during the first half of the sessions, there was no strain x delay interaction (F(3, 63) &lt; 1). There were also no sex x delay (F(3,63)=1.9, p=0.14) or sex x strain (F(1,21) &lt;1) interaction effects. We found no significant differences in the difference (% correct long- % correct short) between the long delay (32s) and short delay (4s) revealed no main effect of strain (F(1, 21)&lt; 1), sex (F(1, 21) =1.8, p=0.20), and no interaction (F(1, 21)= 1.7, p=.21 ) as shown in Figure 5D.

We next aimed to determine whether their performance was affected by early vs late state of multi-delay training and if strain influenced performance across the sessions for the first stage of multi-delay testing (2,4,8,16s). Because we found no sex differences throughout this study, we combined males and females for this analysis. We found that overall rats showed increased performance on the second half of the multi delay sessions (Sessions 6–10) as shown in Figure 5E. Specifically, as shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA, we found that there was a main effect of delay (F(1.817, 41.79) = 94.14, p&lt;0.0001), a main effect of session (F (1, 23) = 23.60, p&lt;0.0001), but not a main effect of strain (F(1, 23) &lt; 1). However, we found that there was a significant delay × strain interaction effect (F(3, 69) = 3.078, p=0.033) and a delay × session interaction (F(2.412, 55.47) = 8.818, p=0.0002), but not a strain x session interaction (F(1, 23) = 1.618, p=0.22). We also found that the difference (% correct long- % correct short) between the long delay (16s) and short delay (2s) revealed a main effect of session (1–5 vs 6–10; F(1, 44)=10.4, p=0.002) and strain (F(1, 44)=6.5, p=0.015), and no interaction effect of session and strain (F(1, 44) =3.0, p =0.09) as shown in Figure 5G.

3.6. Fischer 344 rats and Long-Evans rats perform similarly on hits and false alarms, but there are delay dependent differences in sensitivity index measures.

In addition to analyzing our data across sessions as % correct, we calculated a subset of measures in signal detection theory including hits, false alarms, accuracy, and sensitivity index for multi-delay stage 1 (sessions 1–5, Table 1, sessions 6–10, Table 2), stage 2 (Table 3), and stage 3 (Table 4). As shown by a three-way mixed ANOVA, we found that for all measures there was a main effect of delay for the first half (sessions 1–5) of multi-delay stage 1 (h: F(2.5, 53)=17.7, f: F(2.7,56)=27.7, A’: F(2.4, 49)=54, SI: (F(2.6, 54.9) =61.5, all p values&lt; 0.0001), second half (sessions 6–10) of multi-delay stage 1 (h: F(2.2, 46.7)=8.9 p=0.0003, f: F(1.7=9,41.5)=17.6 p&lt;0.0001, A’: F(2.6, 55)=30.8 p &lt;0.0001, SI: F(2.3, 47.7) =33.7 p &lt;0.0001), multi-delay stage 2 (h: F(2, 42.7)=28.0, f: F(1.6,32.8)=24.7, A’: F(2.5, 54)=76.1, SI: (F(1.6, 33.7) =47.3, all p values&lt; 0.0001), and multi-delay stage 3 (h: F(2.5,52) =41.5, f: F(2.7, 57.6)=39, A’: F(2.3, 48.3)=77.9, SI: F(2.3, 48.8)=85.2, all ps &lt;0.0001) We found no main effect of sex or stain for these measures (all Fs &lt;1, except strain: multi-stage 2, A’: F(1,21)=1.7, p=0.2, multi-stage 3, h: F(1,21)=1.1, p=0.32, A’: F(1,21)=1.6, p=0.23). We found a delay x strain interaction for sensitivity index for the first half of sessions (F(3,63)=4.8, p=0.005) similar to when we calculated our data as % correct (Figure 5). In addition, we also found a delay × strain interaction (F(3,63)=3.6, p=0.018) for sensitivity index for the multi-delay stage 3 (delays 4, 8, 16, 32 s) in which Fischer rats show higher sensitivity indices than Long-Evans rats (Table 4).

4. Discussion

We found in the operant version of the delayed non-match to position task (DNMTP) that Fischer rats transiently performed better than the Long-Evans rats. During acquisition of the task, both Fischer 344 rats and Long-Evans rats required a similar number of days to learn to lever press to earn a reward. However, Fischer rats learned to nose poke in order to self-initiate the beginning of a trial faster than Long-Evans rats (Figure 2C). Both rats performed similarly on the fixed delay session (6s) in the DNMTP task prior to beginning the multi-delay sessions. Fischer rats responded quicker on the sample lever throughout the multi-delay testing than Long-Evans rats (Figure 2F). While all rats gained weight throughout the course of the study, Long-Evans rats gained more weight than Fischer rats (Figure 2A, Figure 3A). This is consistent with observations that Long–Evans rats have greater bone lengths and weigh more than Fischer rats (Webb, Gowribai, and Muir 2003). However, we did not find any correlations in body weight change and measures of training (Days to Criterion, Self-Initiated) or latency to press to sample in either strain (Figure 3B–C). Indeed, the subset of Long-Evans rats that showed a similar weight change to the Fischer rats at the time of self-initiated trials performed similar to the majority of Long-Evans rats that gained more weight (Figure 3B). Even though there was no correlation between weight change in performance in either strain, it is possible that the overall relatively decreased gained of body weight contributed to elevated motivation in Fischer 344 rats measured by increased learning to nose poke during self-initiated trials and increased latency to press the sample lever.

Interestingly, on the first stage of multi-delay sessions, Long-Evans rats performed worse than Fischer 344 rats (Figures 3–5, Tables 1–4). However, this effect was transient, and by the two additional multi-delay stages that incorporated even longer delay lengths, there were no differences in behavioral performance between Fischer 344 and Long-Evans rats as measured by % correct. Interestingly, when examining the sensitivity index, a signal detection measure for the ability to successfully discriminate (Klinkenberg and Blokland 2011; Steckler 2001), Fischer rats also showed an increased performance at the multi-delay stage 3 compared to Long-Evans (Table 4), suggesting that the performance differences extend further even if Long-Evan rats catch up after 10 days at the shorter delays (Figure 5). Altogether, these findings that the Long-Evan strain performance was delayed compared to Fischer 344 rats was particularly interesting as the Long-Evans rat strain are more commonly used in cognitive tasks. This is consistent with findings that Fischer 344 rats also shown enhanced performance on a delayed non-match to position task compared to another pigmented rat strain, the Brown Norway rat (Josef Van Der Staay and Blokland 1996).

It has been argued that the Long-Evans higher visual acuity than albino strains, such as the Fischer 344, allows for improved performance in cognitive testing (Jacobs, Fenwick, and Williams 2001). In a delayed match to sample task requiring visual acuity in a T-maze, Fischer rats take longer to acquire the task than Long-Evans rats (Aggleton 1996). In addition, Long-Evans perform delayed object recognition memory tasks better than albino rats (Blokland and Sesia 2023). In our task, the cue light is illuminated, but there are no colors or additional defining features, which may make it easier to discriminate regardless of visual acuity. When rats must learn or discriminate more complex features (e.g., color light, flashing light) for the behavioral or cognitive task, then the Long-Evans strain may be the more optimal choice (Jacobs, Fenwick, and Williams 2001; West et al. 2011; West et al. 2012).

It is also possible that the early differences between the Long-Evans and Fischer rats are due to the two strains utilizing different strategies for completion of the task with Fischer rats adopting the more efficient strategy earlier. Long-Evans rats show improved performance over the Fischer rats in a visual spatial T-maze (Aggleton 1996) and spatial place tasks (Harker and Whishaw 2002), while we show that Fischer rats show better performance over the Long-Evans rats in the operant DNMTP task. As such, it is also possible that there are different strategies for the operant version of task versus spatial version of the task and the different strains have distinct ways of learning this information. For example, the hippocampus is critical for delayed (non) matching performance in tasks that requires spatial navigation such as a T-maze or water maze (Hampson, Jarrard, and Deadwyler 1999; Nguyen et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2013), while the hippocampus is not necessary for performance in the operant version of the delayed (non)match to position task (Sloan, Good, and Dunnett 2006). Thus, it is possible that there are functional differences between these two strains that account for the varying degree of performance that should be considered when manipulating the critical circuits for behavior in transgenic rat models.

Fischer rats are smaller and put more of their body weight on their hind limbs relative to their forelimbs. In contrast, Long–Evans rats are larger and put more weight on their forelimbs relative to their hind limbs (Webb, Gowribai, and Muir 2003). As such, it is possible that Fischer rats require more goal-directed behavior in order to engage in a lever pressing task (in which rats typically use their forelimbs) which may contribute to Fischer 344 rats picking up the task quicker. In addition, the motor map of Long-Evans rats is more sensitive to microstimulation and is larger than Fischer rats (relative to body size) suggesting less stimulation is required in the Long-Evans to initiate movement (VandenBerg et al. 2002). Both strains showed topographic motor plasticity, however, Long-Evans were better at reaching tasks and had a larger topographic motor map than Fischer rats (VandenBerg et al. 2002). It is possible that if Long-Evans rats are more sensitive to eliciting movement. They are more active than Fischer rats, and this activity actually interferes with the ability to retain which lever to press during the delay phase of the task. This would be consistent with the Long-Evans rats showing faster decay of performance with delay length in the first stage of multi-delay testing (Figure 3).

While we reported transient strain differences in behavioral performance in the DNTMP task, when rats are tested with multiple delays within a session, both strains are sensitive to delay length (i.e., performance is worse at a greater delay length) in the operant task. Depending on the demands of the study, either of the two strains may be ideal. For example, in the first half of the stage 1 training, Fischer 344 rats only show a delay dependent dampening of performance relative to the shortest delay (2s) compared to the longest delay (16s), while Long-Evans start to show diminished performance at the middle 8 second delay. Thus, if one is trying to determine if a brain region is critical in a delay dependent or independent manner, the Long-Evans strain could be used since they are more sensitive to varying delay early in training sessions. Whereas for a brain region that impairs performance regardless of delay length, the strain chosen may not affect the outcome of the study. Indeed, the medial prefrontal cortex, for example, is critical for behavioral performance across delays in both the Long-Evans strain (Auger and Floresco 2017) and the Fischer 344 strain (McQuail et al. 2016). In addition, since Fischer rats show better performance in the first couple sessions of stage 1 of the DNTMP training, the Fischer strain may be the ideal strain for use in aging studies in order to show sufficient decreases in behavioral performance with age (i.e., the Fischer have a higher baseline at the standard 2–4 months age range). Indeed, delayed working memory tasks are sensitive to aging related decline in behavioral performance in Fischer rats (Beas, Setlow, and Bizon 2013). Finally, in a study that requires multiple testing days, the Fischer rats may be ideal as their behavioral performance is more stable across the DNTMP sessions, while Long-Evans performance increases in late sessions of stage 1 (Figure 5).

For all of the measures studied, we found no significant sex differences in behavioral performance in either strain of rat. However, we were likely underpowered to detect sex differences in this current study. We did find a couple measures where there was a trend towards significance including the numbers of presses during FR1 training in which females pressed more than males. This is consistent with other work showing that female rats will press more for sucrose rewards than male rats (Grimm et al. 2022). We found no evidence of a sex difference in the DNMTP task, which is different from other studies that have shown a male advantage across rat strains including Fischer and Long-Evans strains in working memory tests, specifically, in radial arm maze tests of working memory (Jonasson 2005). As such future work would need to examine sexes more robustly including measuring estrus as an additional biological factor. While working memory in spatial tasks is consistent across estrous cycle in female rats (Stackman et al. 1997), many studies have shown that estrous cycle plays a significant role in learning, memory and motivation in female rats (Calipari et al. 2017; Corbett, Dunn, and Loweth 2021; Bless et al. 1997; van Goethem et al. 2012). In addition, studies in humans have shown differences in working memory for men and women, For example, in humans, some studies have reported a male advantage in spatial memory and female advantage in visual memory tasks (Fernandez-Baizan, Arias, and Mendez 2019; Harness et al. 2008). It is possible that a different task (e.g., spatial) may show differences between the sexes. Thus there could be different task demands and other factor such as estrous cycle and environment that illuminate sex differences in working memory in humans or these differences may be nonexistent (Solianik, Brazaitis, and Skurvydas 2016).

Future studies will aim to determine the neural circuits that underlie working memory in a rat developed to recapitulate Alzheimer’s disease, which uses the Fischer344 background strain. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by memory impairments, and it affects the mood, behavior, personality, and daily lives of the patients. With the advances in technology and emergence of transgenic models of AD using the Fischer 344 background strain used in this study, research on this debilitating disease has improved our understanding of its pathology but no cure or disease-altering treatment has yet been discovered. As such understanding the background strain used for the AD rat model is critical to understand how the pathology that accumulates in this strain affects the cognitive behavior. Given the rich amount of behavioral neuroscience research that has been conducted using Long Evans rats in cognitive task, it will be critical care that circuitry data is properly contextualized to the Fischer rats.
