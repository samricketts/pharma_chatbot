The advent of effective antiretroviral medications (ARVs) has led to an aging of the HIV population with approximately 50% of people with HIV (PWH) being over the age of 50 years. Neurocognitive complications, typically known as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), persist in the era of ARVs and, in addition to risk of HAND, older PWH are also at risk for age-associated, neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has been postulated that risk for AD may be greater among PWH due to potential compounding effects of HIVand aging on mechanisms of neural insult. We are now faced with the challenge of disentangling AD from HAND, which has important prognostic and treatment implications given the more rapidly debilitating trajectory of AD. Herein, we review the evidence to date demonstrating both parallels and differences in the profiles of HAND and AD. We specifically address similarities and difference of AD and HAND as it relates to (1) neuropsychological profiles (cross-sectional/longitudinal), (2) AD-associated neuropathological features as evidenced from neuropathological, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging assessments, (3) biological mechanisms underlying cortical amyloid deposition, (4) parallels in mechanisms of neural insult, and (5) common risk factors. Our current understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities of AD and HAND should be further delineated and leveraged in the development of differential diagnostic methods that will allow for the early identification of AD and more suitable and effective treatment interventions among graying PWH.

Public health significance—aging and age-associated disorders among PWH

With increased effectiveness of antiretrovirals (ARVs), HIV has shifted from a deadly disease with an aggressive time course to a chronic disease with increased longevity. Presently, one half of people living with HIV (PWH) in the USA are over 50 years of age and life expectancy among ARV-treated adults is approaching that of the general population (Antiretroviral Therapy Cohort 2017; CDC 2017; Lohse et al. 2007; May and Ingle 2011). The “graying of the HIV epidemic” has introduced new challenges including increasing rates of age and inflammation-related comorbidities including central nervous system (CNS) complications. Currently, one of the most common CNS complications is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) (Antinori et al. 2007). Rates of the milder forms of HAND, asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment (ANI) and mild neurocognitive disorder (MND) persist, if not increased in the post-ARV era (Heaton et al. 2010). With increased survival of older PWH, there is an increased likelihood that some will also suffer from common age-associated disorders including neurodegenerative dementias and their precursor stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Because Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common dementing condition, this review focuses specifically on AD, which includes both MCI and Alzheimer’s-type dementia.

Older PWH may be particularly at risk for age-associated, neurodegenerative diseases including AD given evidence of synergistic effects of HIVand aging on the brain (Hodes et al. 2016; Van Epps and Kalayjian 2017).Some evidence suggests premature or accelerated aging phenotypes among PWH (Stoff et al. 2017). For example, age-associated conditions appear 5–10 years earlier in PWH versus the general population (Deeks 2011; Deeks and Phillips 2009; Durand et al. 2017). Using an epigenetic prediction of age based on DNA methylation levels, PWH demonstrate accelerated aging of 7.4 years in brain tissue and 5 years in peripheral blood versus HIV-uninfected (HIV-) persons (Horvath and Levine 2015). Further supporting accelerated aging among PWH, Sheppard et al. (2017) demonstrated that neurocognitive performance in older PWH (aged 50–65) was worse than age-matched HIV-adults but similar to older (≥ 65 years) HIV-adults.

Evidence of PWH with AD

Presently, evidence of a probable/possible AD diagnosis in PWH, either alone or in conjunction with HAND, is derived mostly from case studies (Morgello et al. 2018; Tripathi et al. 2016; Turner et al. 2016). In the case of a 71-year-old man living with HIV for 14 years, an AD-like profile was indicated by clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging assessments (Turner et al. 2016). His family reported that he had mild short-term memory problems for the past 5 years with insidious onset and a noticeable decline in the past 3 years. He also demonstrated similar alterations in resting-state functional connectivity as seen in HIV-individuals with MCI (n = 8) or mild Alzheimer’s-type dementia (n = 14) versus 42 age-matched cognitively normal individuals. Moreover, [18F]florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) imaging demonstrated marked cortical amyloid-β (Aβ42) plaque deposits, a hallmark neuropathological characteristic of AD (Turner et al. 2016). In a second case, a 70-year-old woman presented with memory complaints. PET imaging detected abnormal phosphorylation of the tau protein (p-tau) in the women, which leads to another AD neuropathological hallmark, neurofibrillary tangles (Tripathi et al. 2016). Recently, two virally-suppressed female cases (52 and 81 years old) demonstrated AD neuropathology and age-related tau astrogliopathy. Consistent with AD, the 52-year-old demonstrated severe learning, memory, and daily function impairment; however, the 81-year-old was managing all actives of daily living (Morgello et al. 2018). One clinical study demonstrated that PWH were over seven times more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for MCI than HIV-individuals (Sheppard et al. 2015). Importantly, MCI diagnosis was associated with older age and mild declines in activities of daily living but not with HIV-related clinical factors.

The minimal evidence of PWH with diagnosed possible/probable AD may be an artifact of the fact that most cohorts of PWH are middle aged rather than older. The majority of large-scale, longitudinal, cohort studies including the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) have focused on mid-life (~ 40 years old) or younger. Large-scale data will continue to emerge over the next decade with continued follow-up of MACS and WIHS individuals into their 50s and 60s. Also, multiple prospective, cohort studies with a focus on aging among PWH have commenced including the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, the Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Observations in People Over Fifty (POPPY), and a 12-year follow-up study of individuals enrolled in CNS HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy Effects Research (CHARTER) study. As more PWH reach an age where they are at risk for traditional dementias, clinicians should assess for AD in older PWH, and researchers will benefit from prioritizing longitudinal studies of older PWH measuring AD-related markers.

Importance of distinguishing between HAND and AD

Given that half of PWH are over 50 years old (CDC 2017) and ~ 45% of PWH are diagnosed with HAND (Heaton et al. 2010), it is possible that a considerable proportion of these individuals are on an AD trajectory, but are erroneously presumed to have HAND given their HIV diagnosis. Clinicians and researchers are faced with a new challenge of distinguishing between early signs of AD and mild forms of HAND. Typical protocols for diagnosing AD including neurocognitive, neurological, and neuroimaging assessments have not yet been tested in the context of PWH. Distinguishing between AD and HAND is important for both clinical and experimental reasons. Clinically, the more degenerative profile of AD requires different life planning and treatment options versus the HAND profile in which neurocognitive impairment (NCI) is typically more stable (Milanini and Valcour 2017). A delayed AD diagnosis in PWH would limit the opportunity to intervene early in the course of AD when interventions are most effective and life planning can be better implemented. Experimentally, the identification of AD among PWH will lead to more accurate prevalence estimates of HAND and will improve studies examining biomarker, imaging, and genetic correlates of HAND.

Parallels and differences in profiles of HAND and AD

Table 1 provides a summary of the evidence outlined below and builds upon a previously-published summary of features differentiating HAND from AD in (Milanini and Valcour 2017).

Neuropsychological profiles

Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is the MCI subtype that is specifically associated with increased risk of progression to Alzheimer’s-type dementia (Petersen 2004; Petersen et al. 1999). There is considerable overlap in the neuropsychological profiles of aMCI and the milder forms of HAND. Both conditions are defined by mild impairment (neuropsychological scores 1–1.5 SD below normative mean) and with none-to-mild difficulties in everyday function. aMCI is characterized specifically by episodic memory deficits (Petersen et al. 1999) and although the domains impacted by HAND vary, memory (e.g., delayed recall) is one of the domains most impaired in PWH currently (Heaton et al. 2011; Rubin et al. 2017).

There are also important differences between aMCI and HAND that may allow us to better distinguish the conditions including the type and trajectory of memory deficits. For example, aMCI is characterized by hippocampal-based encoding, storage and rapid forgetting deficits that are observed on memory recall and recognition tests (Petersen et al. 1999). Conversely, evidence suggests a more “subcortical” pattern of NCI in HAND including processing speed, executive function, and memory retrieval deficits but relatively normal memory storage and retention in the pre (i.e., impaired recall but intact recognition) (Becker et al. 1995; Peavy et al. 1994; White et al. 1997) and post-ARV era (Scott et al. 2011); although not always (Maki et al. 2015; Tierney et al. 2018). This cortical versus sub-cortical distinction was recently evidenced in a study where a combination of six neuropsychological tests discriminated aMCI from mild HAND with 86% accuracy (Milanini et al. 2016). HAND was distinguished from aMCI by better performance on the recognition subtest of the California Verbal Learning Test and the Digits Backward Test (working memory), and worse performance on the Mini Mental State Exam (global function), Trails A (attention), Trails B (executive function), and Digit Symbol (processing speed). Additionally, longitudinal studies indicate differing trajectories of NCI among persons with HAND versus aMCI. Specifically, among virally suppressed PWH, HAND is typically characterized by mild cognitive deficits fluctuating across and within affected domains (Brouillette et al. 2016; Sacktor et al. 2016) rather than the rapidly progressive declines typically observed in aMCI. Although these differences allow for opportunities to disentangle aMCI and HAND, conventional diagnostic approaches, without experienced clinical interpretation, are not sensitive to profiles and trajectories of domain-specific impairment.

AD-associated neuropathological features in HIV

Neuropathology studies

Studies suggest commonalities in the neuropathological processes underlying AD and HAND. The hallmark pathological characteristics of AD, Aβ42 plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles are observed in normal aging (Sjogren et al. 2001); however, excessive plaque and tangle burden is indicative of disease pathology. Aβ42 plaque deposition is an initial event in the AD trajectory that can occur more than a decade before clinical symptoms (Bateman et al. 2012; Morris and Price 2001). Aβ42 plaque deposits are also observed in the brains of HIV+ post-mortem cases, particularly older cases (Achim et al. 2009; Aksenov et al. 2010; Esiri et al. 1998; Gelman and Schuenke 2004; Green et al. 2005; Rempel and Pulliam 2005; Xu and Ikezu 2009), and the degree of deposition increases with age (Esiri et al. 1998; Xu and Ikezu 2009) suggesting that Aβ42 pathology may contribute to accelerated aging or AD risk in PWH. Similar to AD, plaque deposition is found in mid-temporal and frontal lobe regions in PWH (Esiri et al. 1998); however, the deposition appears to a greater extent in AD versus HIV (Cohen et al. 2015). Aβ42 plaque type and deposition pattern also differs between HIVand AD. Whereas Aβ42 plaques in AD are predominantly neuritic, associated with abnormal neural/glial function and deposited extracellularly, the plaques in HIVare typically “diffuse” and deposited intracellularly (e.g., neuronal soma and axonal tracks) (Brew et al. 2009; Brew and Letendre 2008; Everall et al. 2009; Green et al. 2005). These plaque differences do not necessarily discriminate AD from HAND-related neuropathology given that diffuse plaques are thought to be the precursor to neuritic plaques and they are consistently observed in Down’s Syndrome patients who inevitably develop AD if their lifespan allows (Brew and Letendre 2008). Thus, it is unclear whether the intraneuronal, diffuse plaques in HIV are associated with AD but manifest differently in the context of HIVor whether they reflect a different disease process.

The research examining p-tau and neurofibrillary tangles PWH is sparse. In one neuropathological study, higher p-tau levels were found specifically in the frontal cortex tissue of 8 PWH with HIV encephalitis (HIVE) versus 8 PWH without HIVE (Patrick et al. 2011), although, in the ARVera, HIVE is generally less common and has shifted from a subacute, rapidly progressive condition with subcortical pathology to a more chronic and mild condition with cortical pathology (Achim et al. 2009; Brew 2004). In the HIVE cases, p-tau levels were positively correlated with the expression of CDK5 and p35; kinases that contribute to atypical phosphorylation of neural substrates and neuronal death when abnormally activated. In another study, elevated levels of p-tau were observed in the hippocampus of 29 HIV+ cases compared to seven age-matched, HIV-cases with the highest levels reported in ARV-treated cases (Anthony et al. 2006).

Cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging studies

Changes in Aβ42 and p-tau can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and by PET imaging as an early surrogate marker of pathology. Lower levels of CSF Aβ42 indicate greater cortical deposition of Aβ42 plaques (Fagan et al. 2006; Roe et al. 2013), whereas higher levels of CSF p-tau indicate greater p-tau in the brain. The literature regarding CSF levels of Aβ42 in PWH is equivocal with some reporting no differences between HIV-individuals and ARV-treated (Ances et al. 2012) or non ARV-treated PWH (Gisslen et al. 2009) or both (Steinbrink et al. 2013), whereas other studies conducted in the post-ARVera report reductions in CSFAβ42 levels in PWH with HAND versus HIV-individuals although treatment information was unavailable in some (Brew and Letendre 2008; Brew et al. 2005; Clifford et al. 2009; Krut et al. 2013). In one study comparing HIV-individuals with Alzheimer’s-type dementia (n = 20) and without NCI (n = 20) and HIV+ individuals with AIDS Dementia Complex (ADC, another term for HAD; n = 87) and without NCI (n = 30), CSFAβ42 levels in those with ADC were lower than both HIV+ and HIV-participants without NCI and comparable to the HIV-Alzheimer’s-type dementia patients (Brew et al. 2005). Disparate findings may be due to small samples and differences in age and severity of HAND whereby Aβ42 is more common among older PWH with moderate-to-severe impairment. Fewer studies use amyloid PET imaging to detect Aβ42 plaques in PWH and, in contrast to CSF findings, these post-ARV era studies report no evidence of elevated extracellular amyloid fibrillar deposits in PWH that are cognitively normal (Ances et al. 2010) or have HAND (Ances et al. 2012; Ances et al. 2010). Disparities between CSF and PET findings of Aβ42 deposition may reflect the differences in Aβ42 plaque characteristics and deposition in HAND versus AD. Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET measures the extra-cellular fibrillar deposits that are common to AD, and thus may not detect the deposits in HIV that are typically intracellular and diffuse (Anthony et al. 2006; Green et al. 2005; Rempel and Pulliam 2005). Although it is unclear if or how the Aβ42 plaques in PWH relate to AD pathological mechanisms, these studies suggest that altered amyloid metabolism is common to AD and HIV.

In contrast to the neuropathological finding in HIVE cases (Patrick et al. 2011), most studies examining CSF levels of p-tau do not report elevated levels in PLWH versus HIV-individuals (Clifford et al. 2009; Gisslen et al. 2009; Krut et al. 2013; Peterson et al. 2014) although inconsistencies exist (Brew et al. 2005). Studies included comparisons among older and younger HIV-individuals with and without AD and older and younger PWH that were either neuroasymptomatic and untreated, ARV-treated, or diagnosed with HAND (Gisslen et al. 2009; Krut et al. 2013; Peterson et al. 2014). Conversely, Brew et al. (2005) found that patients with ADC had CSF p-tau levels that were higher than PWH and HIV-participants without NCI and comparable to HIV-AD patients. Disparate results may be due to differences in the age range, severity of HAND, time period when cases were gathered, and treatment history of study samples. The detection of cortical tau tangles via PET has yet to be examined in HIV except in the aforementioned case study of the 70-year-old patient with HIVE. Consistent with neuropathological findings in HIVE (Patrick et al. 2011), the patient demonstrated p-tau in the periventricular and deep white matter brain regions (Tripathi et al. 2016).Taken together, these limited findings suggest that p-tau may be a shared pathologic process specifically between AD and HIVE.

AD is also characterized by markers of cellular and synaptic integrity. Neurogranin (Ng) is a marker of synaptic loss (Wellington et al. 2016) shows elevated CSF levels in the early stages of AD relative to normal controls and other types of dementias including subcortically-characterized dementias (Janelidze et al. 2016; Tarawneh et al. 2016; Wellington et al. 2016). Biofluid levels of Ng has not been examined in relation to HAND; however, Ng mRNA was found to be significantly downregulated in PBMCs of PWH with high viral loads compared to demographically-matched, HIV-controls (Duskova et al. 2013). Elevated CSF levels of neurofilament light (NfL) is a marker of axonal injury that has been reported in multiple types of neurodegenerative disorders including AD (Abu-Rumeileh et al. 2018; Bacioglu et al. 2016; Gisslen et al. 2016), and HAND (Abdulle et al. 2007; Jessen et al. 2014; Mellgren et al. 2007; Peterson et al. 2014).

Cell death and brain atrophy are also neuropathologic characteristics of AD particularly in the temporal lobe and other cortical structures (Braak et al. 1998; Braskie et al. 2013; Vernooij and Smits 2012). Brain atrophy is also associated with HAND (Bonnet et al. 2013; Cohen et al. 2010; Masters and Ances 2014). Machine learning approaches demonstrate utility in distinguishing HAND from MCI among older (aged 60–70 years) PWH and HIV-individuals using brain morphometry data (Zhang et al. 2016). Consistent with the cortical-(AD) versus subcortical-based (HAND) dementia distinction, the combination of volume estimates that best distinguished HAND from MCI in the post-ARV era was in cortical and subcortical brain regions that subserve episodic memory, executive function, and fine motor tasks including medial orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, cerebellum, and parahippocampal volume (Zhang et al. 2016).

Biological mechanisms underlying cortical Aβ42deposition in HIV versus AD

Although cortical Aβ42deposition is found in both AD and older PWH, the mechanism underlying the deposition may differ in HIVand AD. Whereas AD is predominantly an auto “proteopathic” neurodegenerative disorder (Jucker and Walker 2011) initiated by misfolding and aggregation of the Aβ42 and tau protein in neurons (Jucker and Walker 2011; Maccioni et al. 2001), HIV infection represents an environmental insult to neurons. In HIV, several steps in the synthesis and clearance of Aβ42 are disrupted by viral proteins and blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise (Andras and Toborek 2013; Ortega and Ances 2014). For instance, the viral protein gp120 alters transcription of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by triggering neural injury and microglial activation (Mocchetti et al. 2014; Ortega and Ances 2014; Rahimian and He 2017). The viral protein Tat promotes Aβ42 aggregation by inhibiting neprilysin, the primary enzyme in Aβ42 degradation (Kim et al. 2013; Ortega and Ances 2014; Rahimian and He 2017; Rempel and Pulliam 2005). Increases in cortical Aβ42 deposition are also associated with longer durations of ARVs, particularly with protease inhibitors (Achim et al. 2009; Green et al. 2005; Rempel and Pulliam 2005). Certain ARVs such as protease inhibitors and efavirenz inhibit the expression of P-glycoprotein expression, which contributes to the clearance of Aβ42 from the brain (Giunta et al. 2008; Lam et al. 2001). Evidence of a shared precursor step to cortical Aβ42 deposition in HAND and AD lies in the β-site Aβ precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and 2 (BACE2), a beta-secretase enzyme that cleaves APP and can lead to an overproduction of Aβ42 oligomers that aggregate into plaques (Vassar et al. 1999). Elevated levels of BACE enzymatic activity are found in all AD stages (Holler et al. 2012; Johnston et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2003). Similarly, studies report elevated levels of BACE1 enzymatic activity, Aβ42 oligomers (Stern et al. 2018) and BACE2 gene expression (Borjabad and Volsky 2012) in the brains of HIV cases. Findings implicate BACE as a common mechanism underlying AD and HAND Aβ42 deposition and highlight its broad therapeutic potential.

Parallels in mechanisms of neural insult in HAND and AD

Certain mechanisms of neural injury are common to both HIV and AD as well as aging in general including chronic, low-grade inflammation, immune senescence, mitochondria dysfunction, compromised BBB (Banks 1999; Bowman et al. 2007), and oxidative stress (Lovell and Markesbery 2007; Nath et al. 2008). In a proteomic profiling study in postmortem HIV+ cases, Zhou et al. (2010) identified 76 differentially-expressed proteins in HIV+ cases with HAD versus without HAD in the post-ART era. Over 90% of the identified proteins also show differential expression patterns in AD, with the large majority reflecting energy metabolism (mitochondria) and signal transduction pathways. Increasing evidence implicates chronic inflammation and immune activation in the accelerated aging and in the development of age-associated, non AIDS conditions, including AD, in PWH. In HIV and AD, chronic inflammation is triggered by activated microglia and astrocytes (Kadiu et al. 2005; Minagar et al. 2002; Ting et al.2007) and is demonstrated by elevated biofluid levels of inflammatory markers including TNFα, IL6, MCP-1, YKL-40, and quinolinic acid (Giunta et al. 2008; Guillemin et al. 2005; Sokolova et al. 2009; Town et al. 2008). Growing evidence also implicates TREM2 in AD- and HAND-related pathogenic mechanisms likely due to its role in regulating neuroinflammation and in phagocytizing extra-cellular Aβ plaques. Decreased levels of membrane-enriched TREM2 were found in the brain tissue of HIV+ cases with HAND versus without HAND in the post-cART era (Fields et al. 2018). A meta-analytic study reported higher levels of soluble TREM2 (indicating greater neuroinflammation) in the prodromal AD stages (Liu et al. 2018). In AD, a high Aβ42 plaque burden can activate microglia (Bolmont et al. 2008), which results in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Streit et al. 2004) that contribute to neural dysfunction (Cameron and Landreth 2010; Maezawa et al. 2011; Perry et al. 2010). In HIV, viral proteins, including tat and gp120, trigger an immune response and inflammation through the release of host-derived cytokines and chemokines (Kovalevich and Langford 2012). Monocyte-driven inflammatory markers in particular (e.g., sCD163, sCD14) have been strongly linked to NCI among PWH (Burdo et al. 2013; Imp et al. 2017; Royal et al. 2016). Neuroinflammation is observed even in virally-suppressed PWH (Aukrust et al. 1999). In fact, ARV-treated PWH show high levels of neuroinflammation, particularly in the hippocampus, a brain region that shows early AD-related changes (Anthony et al. 2005; Eden et al. 2007). Furthermore, immune reconstitution syndrome in long-term, ARV-treated PWH involves recovered immune cells attacking previously-acquired opportunistic infections with an excessive inflammatory response that can contribute to AD pathology either directly or indirectly through subsequent conditions such as vasculitis (Gray et al. 2005; Stoll and Schmidt 2003; Stoll and Schmidt 2004). It remains unclear whether the concurrence of HIV, ARVs, and aging leads to compounding inflammatory pathways that make PWH more vulnerable to AD in general and/or to an earlier onset and more rapid trajectory.

Risk factors common to both HAND and AD

Certain demographic, clinical and genetic factors have been independently associated with increased risk of HAND and AD including, but not limited to, older age, vascular abnormalities, neuropsychiatric characteristics, and APOE-ε4 carrier status. First, older age is the strongest risk factor for AD and is also associated with a greater likelihood of HAND (Hardy and Vance 2009; Sacktor et al. 2010; Tan et al. 2013; Valcour et al. 2004; van Gorp et al. 1994; Vance et al. 2011). Germane to potential manifestations of AD, older age (&gt; 50 years) was associated with a 4 to 5 fold increased odds of memory impairment (Tan et al. 2013) among 106 PWH with HAND. Several studies, but not all (Cysique et al. 2011), reported an age by serostatus interaction whereby older age had more deleterious effects on neurocognitive performance in PWH versus HIV-persons (Hardy and Vance 2009; Sacktor et al. 2010; van Gorp et al. 1994; Vance et al. 2011). Second, vascular disorders including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and obesity are well-established risk factors for AD (Kivipelto et al. 2001; Meng et al. 2014; Qiu and Fratiglioni 2015; Skoog et al. 1996). HIV-related biological mechanisms and ARV medications are associated with hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, abnormalities in body fat distribution and, in turn, these conditions are associated with a higher likelihood of HAND (Fabbiani et al. 2013; Sattler et al. 2015; Schouten et al. 2016). These vascular conditions are likely linked to AD and HAND through similar mechanisms of inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and/or oxidative stress (de Bruijn and Ikram 2014; Helzner et al. 2009; Li et al. 2009; Luchsinger et al. 2005), which further obscures whether NCI reflects AD and/or HAND. Third, meta-analytic studies suggest that depression is a strong risk factor for AD (Mega et al. 1996; Mourao et al. 2016; Terracciano et al. 2014). Evidence also suggests that depression is associated with HAND (Bryant et al. 2015; Milanini et al. 2017), particularly learning and memory deficits (Maki et al. 2015). Last, the APOE-ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD and is linked with earlier AD onset and greater degree of cortical Aβ42 burden (Morris et al. 2010; Polvikoski et al. 1995). Although not consistently (Joska et al. 2010; Morgan et al. 2013), APOE-ε4 is associated with NCI, brain atrophy, and decreases in white matter integrity in older PWH (Chang et al. 2011; Hoare et al. 2013; Panos et al. 2013; Valcour, 2013; Wendelken et al. 2016); even after controlling for HIV-related disease factors (Valcour 2013). A family history of dementia has also been implicated in the development of HAND (Moore et al. 2011). In a post-mortem study, APOE-ε4 genotype moderated the relationship between the presence of Aβ42 plaques and increased likelihood of HAND, whereby this relationship was observed in APOE-ε4 carriers but not in non-carriers (Soontornniyomkij et al. 2012).

In conclusion, the rising rate of older PWH presents a major public health concern for the manifestation and possible exacerbation of AD in the context of HIV infection. Multiple biological and neuropsychological features are common to AD and HAND (e.g., episodic memory deficits, chronic inflammation, Aβ42 plaques), and thus present a challenge in identifying AD among PWH. Although NCI observed among PWH is typically classified as HAND because of their HIV disease, the true source of impairment may be AD or a combination of HIVand AD pathologies in a subset of older PWH. Similarly, AD pathological hallmarks have been observed in PWH although their manifestation differs in some ways from AD. Thus, it is unclear whether these pathological processes are associated with HAND or AD. Further complicating matters, certain risk factors are common to AD and HAND and some result from HIV itself or ARVs such as vascular abnormalities and insulin resistance. Research is needed to determine whether these common risk factors and overlapping disease processes interact mechanistically to exacerbate both AD and HAND. There are some known differences (e.g., AD-specific recognition memory deficits, p-tau biomarker) and possibly currently-unexplored differences in the biological and clinical profiles of AD and HAND. Research is warranted to further dissociate these AD and HAND profiles and leverage these differences to develop differential diagnostic procedures that can distinguish these phenotypes. Identifying AD in PWH has vast clinical implications. If AD in PWH is erroneously attributed solely to HAND, then this limits and possibly prevents the opportunity to intervene early in the course of AD when pharmaceutical and cognitive interventions as well as care, financial and legal planning are most effective and better implemented. Alternatively, the identification of convergent pathophysiological pathways in AD and HAND may represent opportunities for common therapeutic interventions to AD and HAND and other neurodegenerative diseases.
