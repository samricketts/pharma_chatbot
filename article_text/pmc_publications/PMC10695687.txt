Background:

While obesity in midlife is a risk factor for dementia, several studies suggested that obesity also protected against dementia, hence so-called obesity paradox. The current study aims to address the relationship between apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and obesity in dementia.

Methods:

Clinical and neuropathological records of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) in the United States, which longitudinally followed approximately twenty thousand subjects with different cognitive statues, APOE genotype, and obesity states, were reviewed.

Results:

Obesity was associated with cognitive decline in early-elderly cognitively normal individuals without APOE4, especially those with APOE2. Neuropathological analyses adjusted for dementia status showed that APOE2 carriers tended to have more microinfarcts and hemorrhages due to obesity. On the other hand, obesity was associated with a lower frequency of dementia and less cognitive impairment in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. Such trends were particularly strong in APOE4 carriers. Obesity was associated with fewer Alzheimer’s pathologies in demented individuals.

Conclusions:

Obesity may accelerate cognitive decline in middle to early-elderly cognitive normal individuals without APOE4 likely by provoking vascular impairments. On the other hand, obesity may ease cognitive impairment in both demented and pre-demented individuals, especially those with APOE4, through protecting against Alzheimer’s pathologies. These results support that APOE genotype modifies the obesity paradox in dementia.

pmcBackground

The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, and more than 650 million adults were obese in 2016.1 2 Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health 2 Obesity is also a condition of prediabetes3 and is related to vascular diseases4 5. On the other hand, the number of people in the world with dementia was 57.4 million in 2019, which will increase approximately 2.5-fold by 2050.6 Dementia is a syndrome in which there is a deterioration of cognitive function beyond what might be expected owing to the usual consequences of biological aging7, enough to interfere with independence in everyday activities, where at a minimum, assistance is required for complex instrumental activities of daily living, such as paying bills or managing medications.8 The effects of obesity on cognitive decline and incident dementia have been previously reported and discussed.9–19 Obesity in midlife was associated with the progression of vascular injury and atrophy in the brain and incident dementia in later life.10–12 On the other hand, obesity in late life reduced the risk of dementia compared with those with a normal body mass index (BMI) 13–15. A meta-analysis showed a positive association between obesity in midlife and later dementia, but the opposite was true in late life 14. An analysis of data from 1.3 million individuals also indicated that higher BMI has a harmful effect in long-term follow-up and a protective effect in the short-term follow-up before dementia diagnosis 15. The findings from these reports support the obesity paradox in dementia. The term obesity paradox was initially proposed for heart failure, where obese patients had a lower risk of death than those with a normal BMI,20 21 despite the fact that obesity increases the risks of vascular diseases.4 5 On the other hand, another systematic literature review and another report failed to support a paradox on the beneficial impacts of obesity in late life on incident dementia,16 17 suggesting that the concept of the obesity paradox in dementia is still controversial.

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).22–26 Recently, by reviewing the database of National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), we analyzed the effects of APOE on cognitive decline as well as the interaction between diabetes and the APOE genotype.27 28 In the latter study, we showed that diabetes affects cognitive decline in non-APOE4 carriers, but not in APOE4 carriers.28 The NACC database contains a prospective standardized, longitudinal clinical evaluation of a large number of patients in the National Institute on Aging’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADC) program across the United States with available autopsy data for a subset of patients. In the current study, by using this database, we investigated whether obesity is associated with cognitive decline, incident dementia, and neuropathological changes, depending on the APOE genotype, hypothesizing that the obesity paradox could be affected in an APOE genotype-dependent manner.

Methods

Data acquisition—

The clinical data in the NACC database, which were collected by the Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) from September 2005 to September 2018 as the longitudinal Uniform Data Set (UDS),29 30 were assessed in this study. NACC participants are regarded as a referral-based or volunteer case series, and the majority of the subjects are Caucasians, followed by black or African Americans, including both nondemented and demented individuals. To examine the effects of obesity on cognitive decline during aging, and simplify its relationship with APOE genotype, we restricted our analysis to subjects whose APOE genotype information (other than the APOE ε2/ε4 genotype) was available and who were recruited at an age greater than or equal to 60 years of age (selection diagram is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). APOE genotype status was defined as APOE2 carriers (ε2/ε2 or ε2/ε3), APOE3 homozygote individuals (ε3/ε3) and APOE4 carriers (ε3/ε4 or ε4/ε4), and treated as a nominal variable with three values (i.e., E2, E3, and E4), as we did previously.27 28 31 32 Subjects with APOE ε2/ε4 genotype (n=550) were excluded due to the mutually exclusive effects of APOE2 and APOE4 on cognitive decline during aging.27 28 To assess obesity status, we calculated BMI based on the subject’s weight and height, according to the formula.33 We removed subjects whose BMI was less than 20 at any visit (n=710) and subjects whose BMI status changed between obese and non-obese during visits (n=957). If a subject showed BMI over 30 at all visits, we classified them as obese (n= 3,932). As the control group for comparison, we defined the non-obese group. If a subject showed BMI between 20 and 30 at all visits, we classified them as non-obese (n=16,116, Table 1). As an alternative control, we also defined the normal group whose BMI was between 20 and 25 at all visits (n=6,793, Supplementary Table 1). Diabetes and non-diabetes were defined as we previously reported.28 32 To define the dementia status of each subject, we used “NACCUDSD” in the UDS,30 which described cognitive status (cognitively normal, dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or impaired but not MCI (other), Table 1). We also used the neuropathological data of a subset of participants (Table 2), recorded as the NACC neuropathology data-collection form, which collected several age-related neuropathologic changes related with AD, cerebrovascular diseases, Lewy body diseases, and others.34 In some analyses, we also adjusted for hypertension and hyperlipidemia status, defined as any/no history of hypertension/hypercholesterolemia from the subject’s health history form, stored as variables “HYPERTEN” and “HYPERCHO”, respectively, in the UDS.30

Statistical analysis—

To assess the risk of cognitive decline during aging in the NACC cohort, we conducted similar analyses as we addressed the effects of the APOE genotype status and its relationship with diabetes.28 In brief, we used the variable “DECAGE” in the UDS30 to define the age of onset of cognitive decline, which was determined by clinicians after consulting with medical records, direct observation and subject/informant reports. We used a Cox proportional hazard model with sex, race, years of education, obesity, diabetes, and APOE genotype status as covariates; the date of birth as the time of origin; and the age of the onset of cognitive decline as the time of event. Subjects who did not show any cognitive decline at their last visit were right-censored (36.8% of total subjects). Hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the HRs, and associated p-values are reported.

The effects of obesity on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR® Dementia Staging instrument) scores35 were analyzed using a multivariable linear regression model adjusted for sex, race, years of education, age at the cognitive test, diabetes, and APOE genotype status with/without considering the interaction between obesity and APOE genotype status. The effects of obesity on the risk of dementia were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for sex, age, race, years of education, diabetes, and APOE genotype status with/without considering the interaction between obesity and APOE genotype status. The effects of obesity on the neuropathological scores in total subjects were analyzed using a multivariable linear regression model adjusted for sex, race, age at death, dementia status, diabetes and APOE genotype status with/without considering the interaction between obesity and APOE.

We first constructed each model with these co-variants without including the interaction between obesity and APOE, and estimated the effects of obesity. We next added the interaction between obesity and APOE to each model, and when there was a trend in their interaction, we proceeded to analyzing the effects of obesity in each APOE genotype status. When there was no significant interaction between obesity and the APOE genotype status, we treated such results for reference purposes. To decrease type I error, we introduced Bonferroni adjustment when analyzing each APOE genotype status. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant, where statistical analyses were performed using JMP Pro software (version 13, SAS Institute Inc).

Results

Obesity is associated with cognitive decline in early elderly cognitively normal individuals without APOE4, especially those with APOE2.

To assess the effects of obesity on cognitive decline, we first analyzed the NACC variable “DECAGE”, which indicates the age at which cognitive decline begins. By using this variable, we successfully analyzed the effects of APOE on cognitive decline as well as the interaction between diabetes and APOE genotype.27 28 In the model adjusted for sex, race, education, APOE genotype status and diabetes, obesity was indeed significantly associated with earlier cognitive decline across all subjects (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.11–1.23, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1A). Moreover, we observed a significant interaction between obesity and the APOE genotype status (p = 0.0269). Thus, we stratified by each APOE genotype status, and observed that obesity was associated with earlier cognitive decline in APOE2 carriers (HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.21–1.66, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1B) and APOE3 homozygote individuals (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.16–1.32, p &lt; 0.001, Fig. 1C) but not in APOE4 carriers (HR = 1.06, 95% CI =0.99–1.14, p = 0.350, Fig. 1D). When we used the normal group rather than the non-obese group as a control, or adjusted for hypertension and hyperlipidemia status, we still observed similar effects of obesity depending on the APOE genotype status (Supplementary Fig. 2). Notably, we noticed that decline curve of the obesity group became milder after 80 years of age and eventually intersected with that of the control group over 90 years of age, suggesting an age-dependent difference in obesity effects on cognitive decline. To confirm these results, we analyzed CDR scores in cognitively normal individuals. Consistently, while no effects were observed in late elderly (more than or equal to 80 years old) individuals, obesity was associated with worse CDR sum of boxes scores and with some individual items, including community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care (although this was not significant) in early elderly (60 to 79 years old) people (Fig. 2, and Supplementary Table 2). Similar results were obtained when limited to their age less than 75 years old. But, when analyzed across all ages, the effects of obesity became milder and not significant (data not shown). Notably, a trend in the interaction between obesity and APOE genotype existed in the CDR home and hobbies (p=0.0652, Fig. 2B) and CDR sum of boxes (p=0.0823, Fig. 2C) scores of these early elderly individuals. Indeed, obesity was associated with worse CDR scores only in APOE2 carriers (Fig. 2D&amp;E). Consistently, when we used the normal group as a control, similar effects of obesity depending on the APOE genotype status were observed (Supplementary Table 3). Moreover, there were significant interactions between obesity and APOE, where obesity was associated with worse CDR scores in middle to early elderly people with APOE2. These results indicate that obesity is associated with cognitive decline in early elderly cognitively normal people without APOE4, especially those with APOE2.

Obesity is associated with microinfarcts and other vascular impairments in APOE2 carriers.

To address the mechanism by which obesity is associated with worse cognitive decline in subjects without APOE4, especially APOE2 carriers, we analyzed neuropathology records. To overcome the statistical power of the small number of APOE2 carriers who had pathological records available, especially when separated by dementia status, we analyzed all subjects by adjusting for dementia status. In this analysis, there was only one neuropathological variable that showed a significant interaction between obesity and APOE, that is, the existence of microinfarcts (p=0.0185, Supplementary Table 4). We indeed observed that obesity was associated with the existence of microinfarcts only in APOE2 carriers (p=0.0281) but not in APOE3 homozygote individuals (while some trend existed: p=0.119) or APOE4 carriers (Fig. 2F). Such trends were almost similar even when adjusted for hyperlipidemia and hypertension (Fig. 2G). In an exploratory analysis separating APOE genotype status, we observed that the severity of arteriosclerosis and the presence of hemorrhages are also significantly associated with obesity only in APOE2 carriers (Supplementary Table 4). As the vascular system plays important roles in maintaining cognitive function,36 37 these results may suggest that obesity accelerates cognitive decline in APOE2 carriers by provoking vascular impairments.

Obesity is associated with lower frequency of dementia and less cognitive decline in MCI and demented subjects, especially those with APOE4.

Despite these results supporting the existence of harmful effects of obesity on cognitive decline, we also noticed that the frequency of dementia was nonetheless less in the obese group (Table 1 &amp; Supplementary Table 1). Indeed, the odds ratio (OR) of dementia by obesity adjusted for age, sex, race, education, diabetes and APOE was significantly less than 1.0 (OR=0.710, 95% CI =0.66–0.77, p&lt;0.0001), compared to the non-obese group (Fig. 3A). Moreover, there was a significant interaction between obesity and the APOE genotype status (p = 0.0074), where the effects of obesity tended to be stronger in APOE4 carriers (OR=0.648, 95% CI =0.57–0.73, p&lt;0.001), than in APOE3 homozygote individuals (OR=0.722, 95% CI =0.65–0.81, p&lt;0.001) or APOE2 carriers (OR=0.910, 95% CI =0.71–1.17, p=1.00) (Fig. 3B). These results suggest somewhat protective effects of obesity on dementia, which would be stronger in APOE4 carriers. To confirm these results, we analyzed CDR scores in MCI and demented subjects. Indeed, obesity was associated with better scores of CDR memory and orientation in both MCI and demented subjects (Fig. 3C&amp;D). Moreover, while there was no significant difference, there was a trend of better CDR sum of boxes scores by obesity (Fig. 3E). When compared to the normal group, obesity was associated with a better CDR sum of boxes score in MCI subjects (Fig. 3F). More detailed results are described in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6. Notably, there was a significant interaction between obesity and the APOE genotype in the CDR memory score in MCI subjects, where obesity was associated with a better score only in APOE4 carriers (Fig. 3G). In the exploratory analysis for each APOE genotype status, we observed that obesity was associated with better scores of some of the other CDR evaluations in APOE4 carriers or APOE3 homozygote individuals in MCI and dementia subjects (Supplementary Tables 5&amp;6). These results indicate that obesity is associated with less cognitive impairment in MCI subjects as well as demented subjects, especially those with the APOE4 genotype, supporting an APOE-genotype-dependent protective effect of obesity on risk of dementia.

Obesity is associated with fewer Alzheimer’s pathologies in demented subjects.

To further address the mechanism by which obesity protects against cognitive impairment in patients with dementia, especially those with the APOE4 genotype, we analyzed the neuropathological records of demented subjects. Indeed, obesity was associated with fewer AD-related pathologies, including diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (Fig. 4A–C, and Supplementary Table 7). In particular, the effects of obesity on neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were strong (p&lt;0.001), which were still significant when limited to AD patients (data not shown). While there was no significant interaction between obesity and the APOE genotype, our exploratory analyses separating individuals by APOE genotype status observed that obesity was associated with fewer neurofibrillary tangles in both APOE3 homozygote individuals and APOE4 carriers, while APOE4 carriers themselves were more vulnerable to neurofibrillary tangles (Fig. 4D&amp;E). These results suggest that obesity could ease cognitive impairment in both demented and pre-demented people, especially those with the APOE4 genotype, through protection from AD-related pathologies.

Discussion

In the present study analyzing NACC participants, we observed that obesity was significantly associated with earlier cognitive decline across all subjects (Fig. 1A). Notably, we noticed that the cognitive decline curve of the obesity group became milder after 80 years of age, and eventually intersected with that of the control group over 90 years of age, suggesting an age-dependent difference in obesity effects on cognitive decline. Consistent with this notion, when separated by age status, we observed harmful effects of obesity on some CDR scores in only middle to early elderly people (Fig. 2). Despite these results, the odds ratio of dementia by obesity adjusted for age, sex, race, education, diabetes and APOE genotype was significantly less than 1.0 compared to the non-obese group (Fig. 3A). Taken together with the results of CDR scores suggesting beneficial effects of obesity in MCI and demented people (Fig. 3C–F), these results support the obesity paradox in dementia, which has been indicated by other studies.13–15

More interesting, by considering the effects of APOE genotype status, we observed that this obesity paradox in dementia is APOE genotype dependent. In APOE2 carriers, obesity was associated with cognitive decline in early elderly cognitively normal people (Fig. 1B) but not with a lower frequency of dementia (Fig. 4B). In APOE3 homozygotes, obesity was associated with cognitive decline in early elderly cognitively normal individuals (Fig. 1C) and with a lower frequency of dementia (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the obesity paradox was observed in APOE3 homozygotes, but not in APOE2 carriers. Interestingly, in APOE4 carriers, obesity was not associated with cognitive decline in early elderly cognitively normal people (Fig. 1D); however, there was a lower fewer frequency of dementia (Fig. 3B) and less cognitive decline in MCI and demented subjects (Fig. 3G &amp; Supplementary Tables 5&amp;6). Thus, the obesity paradox in dementia was observed in subjects with APOE3 and partially in those with APOE4, but it was not observed in those with APOE2. This APOE genotype-dependency of the obesity paradox may partially explain the discrepancies in results reported in previous studies, in additions to the differences in ethnicity, race, age, sex, and other confounding factors.13–16

Neuropathological analyses adjusting for dementia status showed that APOE2 carriers tended to have more microinfarcts due to obesity. Obesity has been reported to be associated with a significantly increased risk of stroke.5 Consistent with this, obesity is associated with the presence of infarcts, lacunes, and hemorrhages (Supplemental Table 4). We observed the interaction of the APOE genotype and obesity on the presence of microinfarcts (Supplemental Table 4) with no association in APOE4 carriers (Fig. 2F&amp;G). The fact that cerebral amyloid angiopathy tended to be decreased by obesity (Supplemental Table 4) may explain why the presence of microinfarcts was comparable between obesity and non-obesity in APOE4 carriers, although APOE4 carriers have more cerebral amyloid angiopathy.25

Of interest, obesity is associated with fewer Alzheimer’s pathologies in demented subjects (Fig. 4). This is consistent with a previous a report, which showed that higher BMI was associated with lower cortical amyloid burden in late life.38 Conversely, lower BMI in late life is reported to be associated with greater amyloid burden in clinically normal individuals39 and both amyloid and tau burden in cognitively normal and MCI individuals.40 A study using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers also showed that total tau protein and phosphorylated tau protein were lower in obese participants than in non-obese participants.41 In animal models, we observed less amyloid burden in APP; ob/ob mice, APP transgenic mice with obesity42 and APP knock-in mice with obesity (unpublished results). Therefore, one of the underlying mechanisms of the obesity paradox in dementia may be the reduction in Alzheimer’s pathologies by obesity. It would be reasonable to consider that such effects are more prominent for APOE4 carriers, who are intrinsically vulnerable to AD pathologies.24

There have been intense debates regarding the genetic testing of APOE genotype status in clinical practice. Rationale against genetic testing is driven by the lack of effective treatments and its insufficiency for improved diagnosis and prediction, while having potentially emotional and behavioral impacts to APOE4 carriers.43 44 Recent approvals of anti-amyloid treatments may change such recommendations, because the results of APOE genetic testing can offer insights into both clinical benefits and also potential risks of developing amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).44 However, it is still unclear whether APOE genotyping should be widely used in clinical practice, considering the limited therapeutic efficacy and high cost of these treatments.45 46 On the other hand, the current results provide additional rationale for the APOE genetic testing as APOE4 carriers could have greater benefits from obesity to reduce their risk of dementia. The current results likely suggest that elderly APOE4 carriers with obesity does not need to aim normal weight, while it is not clear whether APOE4 carriers are recommended to gain weight to reduce their risk of dementia. Conversely, such potential benefits should be further validated and clarified in detail when genetic tests of APOE allele are widely used in clinical practice. Nonetheless, the risk and benefit of obesity should be appropriately managed in terms of general health for each individual.

There are several limitations in this study. First, we classified subjects who had BMI over 30 at all visits as obese. Although obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health,2 in this study, neither the extent of fat nor the presence of health impairment were accessed. For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as a BMI greater than or equal to 30 and mentions that BMI provides the most useful population-level measure of obesity, as it is the same for both sexes and for all ages of adults, although it should be considered a rough guide because it may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different individuals.2 The evaluation of fat accumulation and health impairment should be added in future studies. Second, the subjects of this study were participants in the National Institute on Aging’s ADC program across the United States; therefore, our analysis was not population based. Third, the obesity paradox in dementia might be attributed to secondary weight loss due to dementia because a decline in weight is observed in individuals with dementia,47 48 MCI49, and the preclinical stage of AD50. A recent study also reported that weight loss due to dementia negatively confounded the association between obesity in late life and brain atrophy, as demonstrated by a magnetic resonance imaging study,17 suggesting that the obesity paradox in dementia might be explained by reverse causation. Although such limitations would not affect our results regarding the APOE genotype–dependent obesity paradox in dementia, future studies resolving these limitations might address more precise effects on how obesity interacts with the APOE genotype when contributing to cognitive decline and the risk of dementia.

In summary, using the NACC database, we observed that (1) obesity was associated with cognitive decline in early elderly cognitively normal people without the APOE4 genotype, especially those with the APOE2 genotype, and that obesity was associated with microinfarcts and other vascular impairments in APOE2 carriers; (2) obesity was associated with a lower frequency of dementia and less cognitive decline in MCI and demented subjects, especially in those with the APOE4 genotype, and that obesity was associated with fewer Alzheimer’s pathologies in demented subjects. These results indicate that the obesity paradox in dementia depends on APOE genotype status. A further understanding of how obesity can reduce Alzheimer’s pathologies would provide clues on how to manage such abundant neurodegenerative diseases in our aging society.

What is already known on this topic

Though there are some controversial results, some studies reported that obesity in midlife was associated with the incident dementia, while other studies reported that obesity in late life reduced the risk of dementia, which is also supported by a meta-analysis. These results indicate the existence of the obesity paradox in dementia. Meanwhile, the relationship between apolipoprotein E (APOE) and obesity paradox in dementia has been scarcely studied. Understanding of their relationship might further clarify the role of obesity in dementia.

What this study adds

This study for the first time revealed the relationship between APOE genotype and obesity paradox in dementia, where the harmful effects of obesity on cognitive decline in middle to early-elderly people is observed in non-APOE4 carriers, especially in APOE2 carriers, while the protective effects of obesity on dementia is remarkable in APOE4 carriers. These results may explain the discrepancies in results reported in previous studies. Moreover, this study revealed the underlying mechanisms; the harmful effects of obesity on cognitive decline is associated with vascular impairments, while the protective effects of obesity on dementia is associated with reduction of Alzheimer’s pathologies, to which APOE4 carriers are intrinsically vulnerable.

How this study might affect research, practice or policy

Obesity can work as a risk and protective factor for dementia depending on APOE genotype. Thus, it would be important to determine the APOE genotype in clinical practice. Especially, APOE4 carriers could have more benefits from obesity to reduce their own risk of dementia.
