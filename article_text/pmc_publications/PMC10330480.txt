Background:

The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has been associated with commonly used biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including brain amyloid plaque density. However, less is known about if changes in the RBANS across time are also related to brain amyloid deposition. The current study sought to expand on prior work by examining the relationship between changes over time on the RBANS and amyloid deposition via positron emission tomography (PET).

Method:

One-hundred twenty-six older adults with intact or impaired cognition and daily functioning underwent repeat assessment with the RBANS across nearly 16 months, as well as had a baseline amyloid PET scan.

Results:

In the entire sample, amyloid deposition was significantly related to change on all five Indexes and the Total Scale score of the RBANS, with greater amyloid being associated with worsening cognition. This pattern was also observed in 11 of 12 subtests.

Conclusions:

Whereas prior studies have identified a relationship between baseline RBANS and amyloid status, the current findings support that changes in the RBANS are also indicative of AD brain pathology, even if these findings are mediated by cognitive status. Although replication in a more diverse sample is needed, these results continue to support the use of the RBANS in AD clinical trials.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; (Randolph, 2012) is a brief battery of tests that assess immediate and delayed memory, visuospatial/constructional skills, language, and attention in adults. It has been validated in multiple samples of older adults, including those with intact cognition (Cooley et al., 2015; Duff &amp; Ramezani, 2015; Phillips et al., 2015; Thaler, Hill, Duff, Mold, &amp; Scott, 2015), Mild Cognitive Impairment, (MCI) (Clark, Hobson, &amp; O’Bryant, 2010; Duff, Hobson, Beglinger, &amp; O’Bryant, 2010; Hobson, Hall, Humphreys-Clark, Schrimsher, &amp; O’Bryant, 2010; Karantzoulis, Novitski, Gold, &amp; Randolph, 2013; O’Mahar et al., 2012), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Burton, Enright, O’Connell, Lanting, &amp; Morgan, 2015; Duff et al., 2008; Enright, O’Connell, MacKinnon, &amp; Morgan, 2015; Heyanka, Scott, &amp; Adams, 2015; McDermott &amp; DeFilippis, 2010; Morgan, Linck, Scott, Adams, &amp; Mold, 2010; Schmitt et al., 2010). Change across time on the RBANS can be examined with a variety of statistical methods in geriatric samples (Duff et al., 2005; Duff et al., 2004; Hammers, Suhrie, Porter, Dixon, &amp; Duff, 2020; O’Connell, Gould, Ursenbach, Enright, &amp; Morgan, 2019). Scores on the RBANS have also been linked to daily functioning in older adults (Duff, Porter, Dixon, Suhrie, &amp; Hammers, 2020; Freilich &amp; Hyer, 2007; O’Bryant et al., 2011). As such, the RBANS provides valuable information about diagnosis, prognosis, and daily functioning in late life cognitive disorders.

Results of several studies have linked scores on the RBANS and various biomarkers associated with AD, including brain amyloid deposition. For example, cerebral amyloid levels have typically been negatively correlated with Total Scale score and various memory scores from the RBANS in older adults with intact and impaired cognition (Duff et al., 2013; Duff et al., 2021; Hammers, Atkinson, Dalley, Suhrie, Beardmore, et al., 2017; Hammers, Atkinson, Dalley, Suhrie, Horn, et al., 2017; Ottoy et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2019), with better scores being associated with less brain amyloid. However, there is very limited literature on changes on the RBANS and its relationship to brain amyloid levels.

It appears that only two studies have investigated this relationship. Ottoy et al. (2019) evaluated 78 older adults, who were either cognitively intact or had MCI or AD, with the RBANS over two annual follow-up visits, and related changes on the RBANS to various AD biomarkers, including an amyloid brain scan. They found that faster decline on the List Recall subtest of the RBANS (but not other Indexes or subtests) in participants dichotomized as amyloid positive. More recently, Zheng et al. (2022) examined 502 cognitively-intact older adults with the RBANS at two visits separated by approximately 3.5 months. Alternate forms were used at each visit to reduce practice effects. Participants also underwent an amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan or collection of cerebrospinal fluid to determine their amyloid burden. In this second study, larger practice effects on the Immediate Memory Index was seen in the amyloid negative individuals.

Although the findings of Ottoy et al. (2019) and Zheng et al. (2022) continued to support the use of the RBANS in clinical trials for prodromal AD, these studies had a number of noteworthy limitations. First, Zheng et al. only examined cognitively intact older adults, when some understanding of the relationship of cognitive change and amyloid deposition in impaired groups would also be valuable. And while Ottoy et al. also examined cognitively impaired participants, they were largely MCI, with few subjects with AD. Second, the retest interval with the RBANS was relatively brief in Zheng et al., which would be rare in clinical settings and longitudinal research projects. Ottoy et al. conducted two annual follow-up visits with their participants, but their attrition by the final visit was quite high (58% did not return), which raises concern about bias. Third, both studies appeared to use a simple difference method to identify change in the RBANS (i.e., Time 2 – Time 1), whereas more sophisticated methods are available for determining cognitive change. Fourth, both studies presented incomplete data on the RBANS, with some combination of selected subtests and Indexes. Finally, both studies dichotomized amyloid results as positive or negative. Although this is commonly done with these neuroimaging results, it is also important to consider this variable continuously, especially when relating it to cognitive results. Therefore, the current study sought to expand on this very limited literature on the relationship between change in performance on the RBANS Indexes and subtests across approximately 16 months and cerebral amyloid deposition in a cohort of older adults who were cognitively intact and impaired. Additionally, instead of using a simple difference method to examine cognitive change, standardized regression-based change scores were utilized, which may be more sensitive indicators of cognitive change. Cerebral amyloid was also considered continuously (vs. dichotomously). Based on existing literature, it was hypothesized that change scores on the RBANS, especially those tapping memory, would correlate with cerebral amyloid, with more amyloid deposition being associated with more cognitive decline. These findings may add to the support for the use of the RBANS as a cognitive marker in AD, allow for enrichment of samples prone to AD pathology in related clinical trials, and give clinicians more confidence in a diagnosis of AD when cognitive change is seen on the RBANS.

METHODS

Participants

One hundred twenty-six older adults were recruited from a cognitive disorders clinic or through the community to participate in a larger study of brain imaging and neuropsychological testing in late life. Inclusion criteria were an age of 65 years or older and having a knowledgeable collateral source available to comment on the participant’s cognition and daily functioning. Participants were excluded for medical comorbidities likely to affect cognition (including neurological conditions, current severe depression, substance abuse, and major psychiatric conditions), the inability to complete PET imaging, the inability to complete cognitive assessments due to inadequate vision, hearing, or manual dexterity, and being enrolled in a clinical drug trial related to anti-amyloid agents. Additional exclusion criteria included elevated depression as indicated by a score of greater than 5 on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, and moderate or severe dementia as indicated by a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 2 or greater or a Mini Mental State Examination score of less than 20.

Participants from the cognitive disorders’ clinic were recruited with a clinical diagnosis of either amnestic MCI (single or multi-domain) or AD. Diagnoses were made by a neurologist based on a neurological visit, neuropsychological evaluation, and brain imaging, where daily functioning was the primary distinction between MCI (i.e., intact functioning) and AD (i.e., impaired functioning). Participants from the community were largely recruited as cognitively intact controls; however, a minority of amnestic MCI cases (~15%) were identified in the community. Confirmation of group assignment was made with the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (Petersen et al., 2010) classification battery, which included the Mini Mental State Examination (Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (Morris, 1993), and the Wechsler Memory Scale – Revised (Wechsler, 1987) Logical Memory II Paragraph A.

Procedure

Procedures were approved by the local Institutional Review Board before participants enrolled. Following informed consent/assent, participants underwent testing with the ADNI battery and other neuropsychological testing, including the RBANS, at a baseline visit. They returned approximately one month later (M=1.3 months, SD=1.7) to receive an amyloid PET scan of the brain using 18F-Flutemetamol. They also returned after nearly 16 months (M=15.8 months, SD=4.4, range=11.8 – 36.7) for a follow-up visit to repeat the RBANS. Form A of the RBANS was given at both visits.

Neuropsychological Measures

The RBANS (Randolph, 2012) is a brief neuropsychological testing battery comprised of 12 subtests used to calculate five Index scores: Immediate Memory Index (comprised of List Learning and Story Memory subtests), Visuospatial/Constructional Index (Figure Copy and Line Orientation subtests), Attention Index (Digit Span and Coding subtests), Language Index (Picture Naming and Semantic Fluency subtests), and Delayed Memory Index (List Recall, List Recognition, Story Recall, and Figure Recall subtests), and a Total Scale score (comprised of all 12 subtests). Using normative data from the test manual, these Index scores are age-corrected standard scores (M=100, SD=15), with higher scores indicating better cognition. Subtest scores are raw scores, again with higher scores indicating better cognition. The RBANS was not part of either the clinical evaluation of individuals nor part of the research classification that confirmed group assignment (i.e., it was independent of the diagnosis).

Amyloid Imaging

Amyloid imaging was performed using 18F-Flutemetamol which is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for PET imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic and diffuse plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment. 18F-Flutemetamol was produced under PET cGMP standards and conducted under an approved FDA Investigational New Drug application (IND). Twenty minutes of emission imaging was performed 90 minutes after the injection of approximately 185 mBq (5 mCi) of 18F-Flutemetamol. A GE Discovery PET/CT 710 (GE Healthcare) was used in this study. This PET/CT scanner has full width at half-maximum spatial resolution of 5.0 mm and excellent performance characteristics (Sunderland &amp; Christian, 2015; Yester, Al-Senan, &amp; White, 2014). Volumes of interest were automatically generated by using the CortexID Suite analysis software (GE Healthcare). 18F-Flutemetamol binding was analyzed using a regional semi-quantitative technique described by Vandenberghe et al. (2010) and refined by Thurfjell et al. (2014). The CortexID Suite software generates, semi-quantitative regional (prefrontal, anterior cingulate, precuneus/posterior cingulate, parietal, mesial temporal, lateral temporal, occipital, sensorimotor, cerebellar grey matter, and whole cerebellum) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) normalized to the pons. A composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in the cerebral cortex was generated automatically and normalized to the pons using the CortexID Suite software (Lundqvist et al., 2013). Consistent with this software, SUVR values of .62 or higher reflect increased amyloid deposition (i.e., amyloid positive), whereas values below that point reflect typical amyloid deposition (i.e., amyloid negative).

Data Analysis

For the entire sample of 126 participants, change on the RBANS was calculated using the standardized regression-based formulae of Hammers et al. (2020), which use Time 1 (i.e., baseline visit) scores and demographic variables to predict Time 2 (i.e., follow-up visit) scores from 129 robustly cognitively intact older adults tested with the RBANS across approximately one year. Briefly, these 129 older adults (age: M=75.6, SD=7.5 years; education: M=15.4, SD=2.7 years; 83% females; 99% White/Non-Hispanic) were recruited from senior centers or independent living facilities, participated in longitudinal studies of cognition and aging, and remained cognitively intact over a 12-month follow-up period. The predicted Time 2 scores were then compared to the observed Time 2 scores in the current sample and divided by the standard error of the estimate of the regression equation to yield a z-score of change, where positive values indicated that the current participants improved more relative to the comparison group and negative values indicated that the current participants improved less (or declined) relative to the comparison group. These z-scores of change were calculated for all RBANS Indexes and subtests. The amyloid SUVR was then correlated (via Pearson correlations) with z-scores of change for the RBANS Indexes and subtests. To protect against multiple comparisons, the primary analyses focused just on the Indexes in the entire sample. The examination of the correlations between the subtests and amyloid was considered secondary analyses. Additionally, correlations between RBANS scores (Indexes and subtests) and cerebral amyloid deposition were also conducted on each subgroup (intact, MCI, AD) as secondary analyses. Given the results of these subgroup analyses (see below) and the possibility that amyloid deposition was completely accounted for by group, additional stepwise regressions were calculated with the z-score of change for each RBANS Index as the dependent variable, and group, amyloid (dichotomously rated as positive or negative), time (baseline or follow-up), and all interactions (group x amyloid, group x time, amyloid x time, group x amyloid x time) as predictor variables. Finally, to further inform clinicians about the utility of changes on the RBANS as a marker of amyloid deposition, these two variables were dichotomized (e.g., amyloid positive or negative, z-score of change on the RBANS being ≤−1.645 or &gt;−1.645 [which is a common threshold for cognitive change]), chi-square analyses were calculated on these two dichotomous variables, and sensitivity (e.g., decline on RBANS if an individual is amyloid positive), specificity (e.g., stable/improve on RBANS if an individual is amyloid negative), positive predictive value (e.g., an individual is amyloid positive if decline on RBANS), and negative predictive value (e.g., an individual is amyloid negative if stable/improve on RBANS) were calculated. An alpha level of 0.05 was used throughout.

RESULTS

For the entire sample of 126 participants, their mean age was 74.1 (SD=5.6) years and their mean education was 16.0 (SD=2.5) years. Nearly all were Caucasian (99%) and 60% were female. Mean premorbid intellectual functioning – as measured by the Reading subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test – 4 (WRAT-4; (Wilkinson &amp; Robertson, 2006) – was in the average range (M=110.2, SD=8.3), and self-rating of depression symptoms were minimal on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (M=1.1, SD=1.3) (Yesavage et al., 1982). Table 1 provides baseline amyloid values and RBANS scores at Time 1 and Time 2, as well as the z-scores of change.

Demographically, those with AD were significantly older than the intact individuals (p=0.002), and the intact individuals had significantly more years of education than those with MCI (p=0.003). Otherwise, there were no differences between the groups on any demographic information (e.g., age, education, sex, or race). There were no differences between the three groups on premorbid intellect, but the intact individuals rated themselves as having fewer depressive symptoms than those with MCI (p=0.012) or AD (p=0.009).

As seen in Table 1, on the RBANS, all three groups were significantly different on the Total Scale score, all five Indexes, and 12 of the subtests at both Times 1 and 2, with the cognitively intact participants having the highest scores, followed by the MCI participants, and then the AD participants (all ps&lt;0.05). The z-scores of change were also significantly different across the three groups for the Total Scale score, all five Indexes, and 11 of the 12 subtests of the RBANS (not Digit Span), with the intact individuals tending to have z-scores around 0 (indicating relatively similar change as the comparison group), and the two impaired groups tended to have negative z-scores (indicating less improvement/more decline relative to the comparison group). For cerebral amyloid, the mean SUVR for the participants classified as intact fell below the cutoff of 0.62 (M=0.52), but those classified as MCI and AD fell above that point (M=0.78 and M=0.79, respectively). Additionally, the intact group possessed significantly lower composite SUVRs compared to the MCI (p&lt;0.001) and AD (p&lt;0.001) participants, and the latter two groups were comparable.

Although there were differences between groups on age and education, nearly all RBANS scores, and amyloid levels, these differences were not considered in the correlational analyses, as the groups were pooled for the primary analyses. Furthermore, the z-scores of change control for various demographic variables.

Primary Analyses

The global composite of cerebral amyloid (SUVR) was significantly correlated with the z-scores of change for the RBANS Total Scale and all five of the Indexes (see Table 2). All correlations were in the expected direction, with greater amyloid deposition being associated with poorer cognitive change on the RBANS scores relative to the comparison group of Hammers et al. (2020a). Although our analyses combined intact, MCI, and AD participants into one group for these correlations, Figure 1 shows the relationship between composite cerebral amyloid (SUVR) and the RBANS Immediate Memory Index z-score of change in a scatterplot, with participants in each group individually presented. The interested reader can contact the first author for additional RBANS score scatterplots.

Secondary Analyses

Cerebral amyloid and RBANS subtests. Consistent with the findings in the Indexes, nearly all of the z-scores for change in the subtests significantly correlated with the global composite SUVR (see Table 2). As hypothesized, the largest correlations were with memory-based subtests. The only subtest that did not significantly correlate with cerebral amyloid was the z-score of change for Digit Span.

Subgroup analyses. Whereas the correlations between cerebral amyloid and z-scores of change were prevalent for the entire sample, they were much more limited when each subgroup was examined separately (see Table 2). In the intact individuals, the only the z-score of change for the Indexes that significantly correlated with the composite SUVR was the Immediate Memory Index (r=−0.32, p=0.01). The only z-score for the subtests in the intact subgroup that significantly correlated with cerebral amyloid was List Learning (r=−0.32, p=0.01). For the MCI subgroup, only the z-score of change for the Delayed Memory Index (r=−0.35, p=0.04) and List Recognition (r=−0.35, p=0.04) significantly correlated with SUVR. In the AD subgroup, none of the Indexes significantly correlated with this marker of amyloid deposition, but Story Memory (r=−0.46, p=0.01) and Story Recall (r=−0.44, p=0.01) did. In each of these significant correlations, higher amyloid deposition was associated with poorer change on the RBANS score. The interested reader can contact the corresponding author for the entire results of this secondary analysis.

Regressions with interactions. For all five Indexes and the Total Scale score, the z-score of change was best predicted by group (all p-values &lt;0.001). For the Immediate Memory Index, Delay Memory Index, and Total Scale score, group x amyloid significantly contributed to the prediction of relevant z-score of change (Immediate Memory Index: F[2,125]=59.8, p&lt;0.001; Delay Memory Index: F[2,125]=41.9, p&lt;0.001; Total Scale: F[2,125]=48.0, p&lt;0.001). No other variables or their interactions significantly added to these models.

Dichotomized amyloid and change on RBANS. For the Immediate Memory Index, the relationship between amyloid status (positive or negative) is related to the change on the RBANS (z-score ≤−1.6.45 or &gt;−1.645), with χ2(1)=41.9, p&lt;0.001. Similar results were found for the Delay Memory Index (χ2(1)=28.4, p&lt;0.001), Total Scale score (χ2(1)=22.1, p&lt;0.001), Language Index (χ2(1)=8.5, p=0.004), and Attention Index (χ2(1)=7.5, p=0.006). Only the Visuospatial/Constructional Index did not show a statistically significant relationship between amyloid status and change on this Index (χ2(1)=3.3, p=0.07). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the total sample for each Index and subtest on the RBANS are presented in Table 3.

DISCUSSION

The current study sought to expand on the very limited literature on the relationship between change on the RBANS across time and cerebral amyloid neuritic plaque density in a cohort of older adults who were cognitively intact and impaired. Although past research has found associations between baseline RBANS Indexes and brain amyloid deposition, very few studies have reported on change in the RBANS as they relate to this AD biomarker. Such associations would add to the support of using the RBANS in clinical practice and research in MCI and AD.

Consistent with the prior work of Zheng et al. (2022), excessive brain amyloid was associated with less improvement/more decline on repeat testing with the Immediate Memory Index. Prior studies have also found that amyloid status (i.e., positive or negative) was related to changes on the Delayed Memory Index or subtests from that composite score (Ottoy et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2022). These prior works did not find associations between other RBANS Indexes and subtests and amyloid status. Conversely, the current study found relationships between the Total Scale score, all five RBANS Indexes, and 11 of the 12 subtests, which demonstrated a broader impact of amyloid on cognition in the elderly. There were some notable differences between the prior studies and current one that might explain some of the differences in findings. For example, the prior studies only examined intact individuals or predominantly MCI individuals, viewed repeat testing across shorter intervals, dichotomized amyloid results, and used a simple difference method to quantify change on the RBANS. As such, the current study seems to complement the existing literature on the range of influences of cerebral amyloid deposition on change on the RBANS across time.

Even though there is limited literature on cognitive change in the RBANS and its relationship to amyloid status, there has been much work done on the change on other cognitive tests and batteries. For example, short-term practice effects on a battery of widely-used neuropsychological tests have been linked to amyloid deposition (Duff, Foster, &amp; Hoffman, 2014). In larger research cohorts, individuals who are amyloid positive tend to show more rapid decline on cognitive tests than individuals who are amyloid negative (Bransby et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2022; Dansson et al., 2021; Lim et al., 2014). Whereas change on memory measures have frequently been associated with this AD biomarker, change on tests that tap other cognitive domains (e.g., global cognition, language, executive functioning, visuospatial) have also been noted. Therefore, the current results fit nicely with the larger knowledge base on cognitive change and amyloid status, but extend these findings to include the RBANS.

When just considering the Indexes of the RBANS, the changes on the Immediate Memory Index, Delayed Memory Index, and the Total Scale score showed the largest correlations with composite SUVRs, which were consistent with the expected results. These correlations of approximately −0.60 indicated that individuals with more amyloid in the brain showed less improvement/more decline on follow-up relative to the comparison sample of Hammers et al. (2020a). Even though the correlations involving these three RBANS scores were modest, they were nearly twice that of the other three Indexes on the RBANS, where the correlations between z-scores of change and composite SUVR tended to be −0.30. These findings align with the relationship between baseline RBANS scores and amyloid measures, where the Total Scale score and the two memory Indexes are most related to amyloid (Duff et al., 2013; Duff et al., 2021; Hammers, Atkinson, Dalley, Suhrie, Beardmore, et al., 2017; Hammers, Atkinson, Dalley, Suhrie, Horn, et al., 2017; Ottoy et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2019).

When just considering the subtests of the RBANS in the secondary analysis, the strongest relationships between score changes over time and amyloid deposition were on memory-based subtests, including List Learning, Story Memory, List Recognition, Story Recall, and Figure Recall, with all of these correlations being larger than −0.50. As with the Indexes, these significant associations are consistent with the few studies in the literature that have examined the baseline subtests and amyloid deposition levels (Duff et al., 2021; Ottoy et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2019). Even though the correlations were smaller, statistically significant relationships existed between change on most non-memory subtests and the composite SUVR, including Figure Copy, Line Orientation, Picture Naming, Semantic Fluency, and Coding. In fact, only change on the Digit Span subtest of the RBANS was unrelated to cerebral amyloid. Such findings may assist in making clinical diagnoses that are much more likely to match pathophysiological diagnoses based on biomarkers. Nonetheless, more work is clearly needed that examines how the individual subtests of the RBANS relate to various biomarkers in AD.

Whereas the results for the entire sample were quite revealing, the secondary analyses on the subgroups were far less definitive. For example, when the correlational analyses were limited to the intact participants, only change on the Immediate Memory Index was related to the SUVR composite. Although the Delayed Memory Index and the Total Scale score trended in the expected direction of less improvement/more decline being associated with more amyloid deposition in the brain, these two scores failed to reach statistical significance. This may indicate that the learning of new information is most related to this biomarkers in individuals who remain cognitively intact. In the MCI subgroup, only change on the Delayed Memory Index was related to baseline amyloid deposition levels, also going in the hypothesized direction. For this MCI group, the other Indexes trended in the expected direction, but did not cross the threshold of p&lt;0.05, perhaps due to limited power. Nonetheless, examining change across time in those with MCI may be a particularly important use of the RBANS in clinical practice and research settings. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, there were no significant correlations between z-scores of change and composite SUVR in the AD subgroup. This may reflect an artifact of reduced variability in the amyloid deposition of the AD subjects (e.g., nearly all were amyloid positive) or near floor-effects at baseline that limited their change across time. Future studies in this area might consider using some easier cognitive tests to examine change in these more impaired individuals.

Given the results of these subgroup analyses (above) and the possibility that amyloid deposition was completely accounted for by group, additional stepwise regressions were calculated to see if group, amyloid, time, or any interactions best predicted the z-score of change for each RBANS Index. Perhaps not surprisingly, the z-scores of change for all five RBANS Indexes and the Total Scale score were best predicted by group in the first step of these analyses. This is largely visible in the z-scores of change in Table 1, where the participants classified as intact tend to have z-scores around 0 (i.e., no change), those classified as MCI having z-scores around −1 (i.e., more decline than 84% of the comparison sample), and those classified as AD having z-scores around −2 (i.e., more decline than 98% of the comparison sample). Change on RBANS in MCI and AD have largely been examined in clinical trials (Gwizdala et al., 2022; Marin et al., 2022; Wessels et al., 2020), so these findings support the “normal” changes over time in these individuals (Hammers, Suhrie, Porter, Dixon, &amp; Duff, 2022; Ottoy et al., 2019; Porter, Dixon, Suhrie, Hammers, &amp; Duff, 2021). In a second step in these regression models, group x amyloid interaction significantly added to prediction of the Immediate Memory Index, Delay Memory Index, and Total Scale z-scores of change. This interaction might be best observed in Figure 1 for the Immediate Memory Index. The vast majority of participants with AD had elevated amyloid and z-scores of change in the negative direction (i.e., decline over time compared to comparison sample), the vast majority of the intact participants had non-elevated amyloid and z-scores in the positive direction (i.e., stability or improvement over time), and those classified as MCI were mixed in terms of amyloid (i.e., some elevated, some non-elevated) and cognitive change (i.e., some in negative direction, some in positive direction). Therefore, it seems like it is primarily the MCI subjects that drive the influence of this interaction. No other variables or their interactions significantly added to these models.

The current study also allowed for a calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of change on the RBANS (i.e., the new test) and amyloid status (i.e., the gold standard for diagnosing the condition of interest). Sensitivity and specificity provide information about a test’s ability to identify individuals as having the condition or not, respectively. Positive predictive value, however, is the percentage of individuals with a positive result on the new test who have the condition of interest. Negative predictive value is the percentage of individuals with a negative result on the new test who do not have the condition of interest. These latter two values consider the base rate of the condition of interest. In the current study, sensitivity tended to be quite low (0.07 – 0.64), which indicates that only 7 – 64% of those who are amyloid positive show a decline. Conversely, specificity tended to be higher (0.91 – 1.0), which indicates that 91 – 100% of those who are amyloid negative remain stable or improve on the RBANS. Positive predictive values tended to be very high (0.91 – 1.0), which indicates 91 – 100% of those who show decline on the RBANS are amyloid positive. Negative predictive values tended to be low (0.41 – 0.63), which indicates only 41 – 63% of those who show stability/improvement on the RBANS are amyloid negative. Whereas sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values are frequently used to examine the clinical utility of tests at baseline (De Jager, Hogervorst, Combrinck, &amp; Budge, 2003; Jacova, Kertesz, Blair, Fisk, &amp; Feldman, 2007; Ryan, Kreiner, Gontkovsky, &amp; Teichner, 2023), they have rarely been applied to cognitive change in neuropsychology. Nonetheless, the current findings seem to indicate that decline on the RBANS provides insight into the brain pathology of older adults with suspected dementia.

Although the current study focused on the relationship between cognitive change and amyloid in these older intact and impaired individuals, it also provided an opportunity to validate the regression-based change scores of Hammers et al. (2020a). Using a robustly cognitively normal sample to develop these change scores, they have been validated in an MCI sample in the past. However, the current study showed that these change scores are also quite related to amyloid deposition in a sample that included individuals with probable mild AD. Furthermore, clear subgroup differences were observed on the z-scores of change from these formulae, with intact individuals tending to show little/no change compared to the original development sample of Hammers et al. (2020a), the AD group showing nearly two standard deviations decline, and the MCI subgroup tending to fall between the other two groups. Whereas the development of change scores is necessary for the field to move forward, their ongoing validation is equally important to make sure that they are meaningful in clinical and research scenarios.

A few notable limitations should also be mentioned for the current study. First, the current sample was limited in its demographic and diagnostic diversity, being largely white and well-educated, which could limit the generalizability of these findings to more diverse populations. Additionally, our intact group performed around the 75th percentile on measures of premorbid intellect and RBANS Total Scale score, which may have influenced the results. Our AD cohort were all mildly impaired individuals, so the results may not apply to more severely demented patients. Second, the current study used the same form of the RBANS at both baseline and follow-up so that we could employ the regression-based change scores of Hammers et al. (2020a). As such, it is unclear if the same relationship between change on the RBANS and amyloid would have been seen if alternate forms were utilized. Third, despite its popularity, the RBANS has limitations. For example, it does not contain measures of executive functioning. As such, the current study sheds no light on the relationship between changes in executive functioning and amyloid deposition, which could be useful in the diagnosis of MCI and AD. Fourth, the range on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was restricted to 0–5 to reduce the influence of depression-related cognitive impairment. Since depression can cause cognitive dysfunction (Ahern &amp; Semkovska, 2017; Peters et al., 2017), it is unclear if these results would remain in a depressed sample. Fifth, the current sample classified based on ADNI criteria, and there is some concern about how accurately the ADNI criteria identify AD-specific cases (Bondi et al., 2014; Edmonds et al., 2015). Additionally, these results may not necessarily be generalizable to individuals with non-AD neurodegenerative conditions (e.g. Lewy Body Dementia, vascular dementia). Future research should address these generalizability concerns and seek to include individuals who are more diverse in race, education, levels of depression, and neurogenerative conditions. Finally, the current study utilized standardized regression-based change formulae, but other methods of examining change across time (e.g., simple difference method, Reliable Change Index + Practice Effects) may have lead to different results. Even with these limitations, the current results provide additional support for using repeated evaluations with the RBANS in clinics and clinical trials of AD.
