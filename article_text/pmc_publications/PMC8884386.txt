Neurological aging is frequently viewed as a linear process of decline, whereas in reality, it is a dynamic non-linear process. The dynamic nature of neurological aging is exemplified during midlife in the female brain. To investigate fundamental mechanisms of midlife aging that underlie risk for development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in late life, we investigated the brain at greatest risk for the disease, the aging female brain. Outcomes of our research indicate that mid-life aging in the female is characterized by the emergence of three phases: early chronological (pre-menopause), endocrinological (peri-menopause) and late chronological (post-menopause) aging. The endocrinological aging program is sandwiched between early and late chronological aging. Throughout the three stages of midlife aging, two systems of biology, metabolic and immune, are tightly integrated through a network of signaling cascades. The network of signaling between these two systems of biology underlie an orchestrated sequence of adaptative starvation responses that shift the brain from near exclusive dependence on a single fuel, glucose, to utilization of an auxiliary fuel derived from lipids, ketone bodies. The dismantling of the estrogen control of glucose metabolism during mid-life aging is a critical contributor to the shift in fuel systems and emergence of dynamic neuroimmune phenotype. The shift in fuel reliance, puts the largest reservoir of local fatty acids, white matter, at risk for catabolism as a source of lipids to generate ketone bodies through astrocytic beta oxidation. APOE4 genotype accelerates the tipping point for emergence of the bioenergetic crisis. While outcomes derived from research conducted in the female brain are not directly translatable to the male brain, the questions addressed in a female centric program of research are directly applicable to investigation of the male brain. Like females, males with AD exhibit deficits in the bioenergetic system of the brain, activation of the immune system and hallmark Alzheimer’s pathologies. The drivers and trajectory of mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in the male brain will undoubtedly share common aspects with the female in addition to factors unique to the male. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicate that midlife endocrine aging can also be a transitional bridge to autoimmune disorders. Collectively, the data indicate that endocrinological aging is a critical period “tipping point” in midlife which can initiate emergence of the prodromal stage of late-onset-Alzheimer’s disease. Interventions that target both immune and metabolic shifts that occur during midlife aging have the potential to alter the trajectory of Alzheimer’s risk in late life. Further, to achieve precision medicine for AD, chromosomal sex is a critical variable to consider along with APOE genotype, other genetic risk factors and stage of disease.

pmc1. Introduction

Mid-life endocrine aging is experienced by women across the globe (Brinton et al., 2015). Each year approximately 1.5 million American women enter the perimenopausal transition, a neuroendocrine transition state unique to the female. As of 2020, there are 45 million US women over the age of 55(United States Census Bureau, 2017). Worldwide, there are currently over 850 million women aged 40–60 years of age (United States Census Bureau, 2014). The menopausal transition impacts neural circuits beyond those associated with reproduction, from hypothalamic functions to executive function, sensory integration, default mode network, learning and memory, emotion and motivation, serotonergic system, and adrenergic system (Brinton et al., 2015). It is also associated with multiple neurological symptoms, such as hot flashes, insomnia, depression, and decline in cognitive function, that can persist into post-menopause (reviewed by (Brinton et al., 2015)). Menopause-associated neurological symptoms have been identified as risk factors for AD (Brinton et al., 2015), and development and/or exacerbation of autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis(Bove et al., 2021; Sammaritano, 2012). Collectively, mid-life endocrine aging transition in females fulfills criteria for a critical period of neural organization that remains a frontier in the neuroscience of aging (Brinton et al., 2015).

Two aging programs are at play in the midlife female brain: chronological and endocrinological (perimenopausal transition); the chronological aging program is subdivided into early (premenopausal) and late (post-menopausal) with endocrinological aging program sandwiched in between. Early chronological aging prior to perimenopause kick-starts midlife endocrinological aging followed by late-stage chronological following completion of endocrine aging. Midlife chronological and endocrinological aging are composed of a series of multi-stage, phased, adaptive responses driven by interactions in the immune and metabolic systems (Mishra and Brinton, 2018; Mishra et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). These changes span across each stage of midlife aging from metabolic reprogramming to immune system activation (Ding et al., 2013a; Ding et al., 2013b; Klosinski et al., 2015; Mishra and Brinton, 2018; Mishra et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b; Yin et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2015). Ultimately the immune system, specifically upregulation of microglial reactivity markers signaling the activation of innate immune response, is the initiator and driver of both programs of aging (Mishra et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2015). In turn, metabolic reprogramming in brain initiates the inflammatory cascade throughout perimenopause, leading to development of an at-risk phenotype for AD phenotype in later life(Wang et al., 2020b). Further, both aging programs are exacerbated by the AD genetic risk factor, APOE4 allele, which can lead to a more rapid progression towards AD. These transitions are detailed further in this review.

Neuroimmune biology in AD has been extensively investigated (Akiyama et al., 2000; Eikelenboom et al., 1994; Griffin, 2006; Heneka et al., 2015; Itagaki et al., 1989; Mattiace et al., 1990; McGeer et al., 1989; McGeer et al., 1987; Tai et al., 2015; Van Eldik et al., 2016). It is also known that the inflammatory state of the peripheral immune system significantly affects that of the brain. The meninges and choroid plexus house a small but significant number of peripheral immune cells that enable a direct interaction with the brain parenchyma (Korin et al., 2017).

However, the forward and reverse translational validity of clinical and basic science targeting the immune system has not yet been achieved(2013; ADAPT Research Group, 2007, 2008; Breitner et al., 2011; McGeer et al., 1996; Meyer et al., 2019; Vlad et al., 2008). From a fundamental basic science perspective, determining immune mechanisms that initiate and drive the age-related brain glucose hypometabolism in women, provides a mechanistic pathway for the pathogenesis of AD. Further, APOE genotype is a pre-existing determinant affecting immune and metabolic responses, wherein APOE4 is linked to increase in antigen presentation and poor lipid metabolism (Bonacina et al., 2018). From a translational perspective, elucidation of the pathways and their timeline of expression provides a map for precision therapeutic interventions that are mechanistically driven and phenotype specific.

Herein we review a critical period in neurological aging: the multi-stage adaptive and response networks of both the metabolic and immune system as they traverse three midlife stages of aging. The complex dynamics of the interaction between the immune and metabolic systems of biology across stages of midlife aging creates the platform on which risk of late onset neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, is created.

2. Metabolic Adaptations During Transitions States

The perimenopausal period marks a significant transition stage of metabolic adaptations. The brain is the most energy-demanding organ, and primarily depends on glucose metabolism as its energy source. Clinical and preclinical studies indicate that early chronological aging and loss of estrogen during menopause is associated with significant decline in glucose metabolism, particularly in posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, frontal, parietal, medial and lateral temporal cortex, (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Mosconi and Brinton, 2018; Mosconi et al., 2018a; Yin et al., 2015). As a result, a series of adaptive programs are required to offset the reduction in glucose metabolism (Fig. 1). As an initial transient adaptation, amino acid metabolism is increased in the brain (Wang et al., 2020b). Potential sources of amino acids can include peripheral supply, breakdown of neurotransmitters, and breakdown / reduced production of synaptic proteins. Further studies are necessary to confirm and identify the specific source. As expression of glucose transporters decline during menopause and late chronological aging (Ding et al., 2013a), a secondary adaptative phenotype emerges that increases utilization of lipids and fatty acids as an auxiliary fuel (Klosinski et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020b). Sources of lipids can include peripheral reservoirs and brain lipids, potentially myelin (Klosinski et al., 2015), as brain is the most lipidated organ of the body (Klosinski et al., 2015). Ultimately, as the oxidative phosphorylation machinery becomes less efficient, metabolic adaptation programs shift towards anaerobic glycolysis to sustain ATP production (Fig. 1) (Wang et al., 2020b). These adaptations comprise a series of compensatory responses to offset reduction in glucose metabolic capacity.

There is a striking parallel between menopausal brain glucose hypometabolism and prodromal AD (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Mosconi et al., 2008a; Mosconi et al., 2008b; Mosconi et al., 2018a). During the menopausal transition, dismantling of estrogen regulation of bioenergetic systems. Estrogen is a master regulator of neuronal bioenergetic system. There is a decline in estrogen which drives a concomitant decline in glucose metabolism during menopause (Rettberg et al., 2014). Dysregulation of estrogenic control of the bioenergetic system is associated with a shift in mitochondrial function from efficient to inefficient which can induce subsequent oxidative damage, and in turn promote neuronal dysfunction (Mattson and Magnus, 2006; Yin et al., 2015; Yue et al., 2005). Human brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies of cognitively normal, midlife women further confirmed that metabolic crisis in aging women may occur upstream of Aβ accumulation, as the extent of bioenergetic abnormalities exceeded that of amyloidosis during the menopausal transition (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b). Similarly, a body of literature points to a brain energy deficit, as measured by FDG-PET, in persons at risk for AD, prodromal AD patients, and AD patients, with worsening severity as disease progresses (Jack et al., 2013; Lin and Beal, 2006; Lustbader et al., 2004; Mattson and Magnus, 2006; Mosconi et al., 2008b; Takuma et al., 2005). Direct examination of brain mitochondria activity using Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) further revealed reductions in cerebral ATP levels AD patients (Gonzalez et al., 1996; Klunk et al., 1996; Mandal et al., 2012; Sweet et al., 2002), consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in AD and preclinical AD models (Gibson and Shi, 2010; Lin and Beal, 2006; Maruszak and Zekanowski, 2011; Moreira et al., 2010; Selfridge et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013).

Mechanistic preclinical studies have demonstrated a decline in mitochondrial function prior to the development of AD pathology, including decreased mitochondrial respiration, decreased metabolic enzyme expression and activity, decreased cerebral glucose metabolism, impaired calcium homeostasis, increased oxidative stress, increased mitochondrial Aβ load, and higher apoptosis (Chou et al., 2011; Du et al., 2010; Hauptmann et al., 2009; Lin and Beal, 2006; Mattson and Magnus, 2006; Mi et al., 2021; Nicholson et al., 2010; Silva et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2009). Evidence from a preclinical rat model that recapitulates characteristics of the human menopausal transition and clinical brain imaging work indicates that the perimenopausal transition is a tipping point for activation of a bioenergetic crisis in the brain that leads to activation of a starvation response (Ding et al., 2013a; Ding et al., 2013b; Karim et al., 2019; Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Rettberg et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2015). The bioenergetic crisis is precipitated by a decline in brain estrogen which induces a loss of estrogen-controlled glucose metabolism and a gain of function in lipid metabolic pathways in brain (Brinton et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2013a; Ding et al., 2013b; Klosinski et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2015). Collectively, the data indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction paired with brain glucose hypometabolism are coupled to brain energy deficit during the menopausal transition, which may predispose the female brains to a metabolic AD risk profile.

From a clinical perspective, we hypothesize that the metabolic challenge of menopause could result in three metabolic adaptations: 1) maintenance of high glucose metabolism capacity, which is not common in females, although it does occur in males of comparable age (45–55yrs); 2) flexible on demand use of auxiliary fuels during perimenopause with sustained metabolic fuel flexibility on as needed basis; or 3) sustained constant use of lipids as an auxiliary fuel which leads to a prodromal AD metabolic phenotype. The second flexible profile in which auxiliary fuels are used on a as needed basis is most likely the most common metabolic postmenopausal profile whereas the third profile of persistent reliance on lipid-based fuels is the adaptation most at risk for AD.

3. Immune transitions during the perimenopause

Microglia and astrocytes are key to the metabolic rescue response and coordinate functions to generate fuel to feed a starving brain. As part of an adaptive response to address the glucose metabolic deficit generated in the brain during mid-life aging in females, white matter catabolism ensues to generate lipids for conversion to ketone bodies as an auxiliary source of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1) (Klosinski et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020a). Evidence from bulk RNA-seq of the hippocampus from perimenopausal rat model indicated that the chronological and endocrinological phases of the perimenopause are characterized by unique immune programs (Mishra et al., 2020). Further, the inflammatory profile is not a linear continuum (Mishra et al., 2020). The pre-menopausal aging phase is characterized by innate immune responses including increased expression of apoe, trem2, cd68, tyrobp and C3 (Mishra et al., 2020), (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Sárvári et al., 2012; Sárvári et al., 2011). The peri-menopausal phase is characterized by adaptive immune responses, most notably, increased expression of interferon response genes. The late-chronological post-menopausal aging phase is characterized by an autoimmune response particularly increased expression of MHC-II (antigen presentation).

The emergence of a dynamic neuro-immune gene expression profile in the hippocampus is consistent with that observed in an accelerated neurodegenerative model (CK-p25 model of neurodegeneration) as “late-stage microglia”, which involves the upregulation of antiviral and interferon response genes and, MHC class II (Mathys et al., 2017). Spatial mapping analysis of the MHC-II expression within the rat brain indicated microglial antigen presentation was evident in white matter tracts including corpus callosum, cingulum and fimbria. Expression of MHC-II was highest in the perimenopausal and post-menopausal groups indicating the susceptibility to steroidal hormone fluctuation during the transition states. In ovariectomized animals, introduction of estrogen as a prevention paradigm immediately after ovariectomy reduced the interferon response and MHC expression (Mishra et al., 2020). Translational validity of the immune profile in chronological and endocrinological aging in women was supported by human hippocampal microarray data indicating increased expression of MHC-II which was significantly greater in women compared to aged matched men (Mishra et al., 2020).

The dynamics of immune signaling during the menopausal transition are the result of an orchestrated network of responses based on the hormonal milieu and reactive responses of innate and adaptive immune systems (Fig. 1) (Mishra et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). Postmenopausal women can express higher chronic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-6 as well as a reduced ability to respond to pathogens or stimuli (Goetzl et al., 2010). These inflammatory processes are thought to ultimately limit clearance capacity of microglia and lead to immune senescence (Mishra and Brinton, 2018).

The inflammatory immune response can function as both a trigger for the hallmark symptom of the menopausal transition, hot flashes, and as the unifying factor that bridges across multiple risk factors for AD (Huang et al., 2017; Karaoulanis et al., 2012). Increased inflammatory mediators are associated with the severity of hot flushes(Huang et al., 2017; Karaoulanis et al., 2012). Hot flashes are associated with subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), adverse CVD risk factor profiles, and presence of small vessel disease (SVD) (Thurston et al., 2008) – all conditions linked to inflammation and to higher AD risk, (Shoamanesh et al., 2015; Zhong et al., 2020). Further, severe night hot flashes were associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) (Freedman, 2001; Thurston et al., 2016). White matter hyperintensities often develop due to small vessel disease in the brain (Avis et al., 2015) and are linked to later stroke and cognitive decline (Debette and Markus, 2010). The complexity of the immune response network across chronological and endocrinological aging creates windows of risk to metabolic, autoimmune and neurological disorders (Desai and Brinton, 2019) (Wang et al., 2020a).

4. The Metabolic-Immune Axis Shapes Aging Phenotypes

Metabolic and immune system transcriptomes and phenotypes are dynamic and respond to a changing landscape of conditions during chronological and endocrinological aging in females (Bacon et al., 2019; Brinton et al., 2015; Klosinski et al., 2015; Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Wang et al., 2020b; Yin et al., 2015). These are systems of biology responses characterized by shifts in profiles rather than single gene on or off responses (Bacon et al., 2019; Mishra and Brinton, 2018; Mishra et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Wang and Brinton, 2016; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b). Adaptation in each system stimulates and initiates changes in the other, and mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic inflammation may exacerbate each other during chronological and endocrinological aging (Yin et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2017; Yin et al., 2015).

To understand the temporal sequences of the interaction between the metabolic and immune systems, it is important to consider the diverse cellular composition of brain, and that neurons and glia have specialized roles within each system (Magistretti and Allaman, 2018; Yellen, 2018). Specifically, different brain cell types have distinctive transcriptomic profiles and metabolic phenotypes that are differentially altered by aging or disease (Lake et al., 2016; Magistretti and Allaman, 2015; Qi et al., 2019; Saunders et al., 2018). Comparative analysis of bulk tissue- and single-cell RNA-seq of Alzheimer’s brains revealed distinct transcriptional changes across cell types, and a decline in metabolic genes at the tissue level is only seen in neurons but not in glial cells from the same region of brain (Mathys et al., 2019).

Moreover, activation of glia, including astrocytes and microglia, by inflammatory stimuli is facilitated by the metabolic shift towards anaerobic glycolysis (Afridi et al., 2020; Aldana, 2019; Ghosh et al., 2018). As described above, the brain metabolic-inflammatory status is differentially regulated by chronological and endocrine aging programs (Wang et al., 2020b; Yin et al., 2015). As the resident innate immune cells in brain, microglia exhibit contrasting roles in aging and AD, as suggested by their neuroprotective functions such as phagocytosis and their neurotoxic effects such as the release of proinflammatory cytokines (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Sarlus and Heneka, 2017). Chronic activation of microglia diverts their physiological and beneficial functions towards sustained low-grade inflammation (Sarlus and Heneka, 2017), which activates astrocytes and negatively affects neighboring neurons (Heneka et al., 2018).

Dismantling of the estrogen-controlled glucose metabolism system during the perimenopausal transition appears to be the harbinger of autoimmune responses (Fig. 1) (Mishra and Brinton, 2018; Wang et al., 2020a). Decline of neuronal glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation during endocrine aging initiates a starvation response (Yin et al., 2015). Astrocytes metabolically support neurons, by inducing the breakdown of white matter to generate lipids (Klosinski et al., 2015). Increased lipid accumulation within astrocytes causes increased β-oxidation and ketogenesis to generate an alternate fuel source that can offset neuronal energy deprivation (Klosinski et al., 2015). Increased myelin debris can cause the activation of microglia and increase microglial antigen presentation and recruitment of adaptive responses (Mishra et al., 2020) (Fig. 1). Induction of the menopausal transition appears to be the domain of inflammation whereas epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, regulates the duration of perimenopause (Bacon et al., 2019).

Whether mitochondrial-originated metabolic deficit or microglia-mediated inflammatory cascade initiates the synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD remains under debate (Yin et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2017). It is clear, however, that hypometabolism and neuroinflammation are well-defined contributors to AD (Akhter et al., 2017; Gibson and Shi, 2010; Ransohoff, 2016; Swerdlow, 2018). As the result of the interaction between the two systems, 2 different aging phenotypes emerge: 1) stabilization of menopausal metabolic and immune profile or 2) heightened and accelerated metabolic and immune dysregulation (Bacon et al., 2019; Mishra and Brinton, 2018; Mishra et al., 2020; Wang and Brinton, 2016; Wang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020b).

5. Interaction of the Aging Programs with Alzheimer’s Risk Factors

Risk factors predictive of AD (Riedel et al., 2018) include genetic risk factors such as chromosomal sex and APOE genotype (Altmann et al., 2014; Brinton, 2008; Brookmeyer et al., 2007; Hebert et al., 2013; Morrison et al., 2006; Yamazaki et al., 2019), as well as modifiable risk factors such as midlife metabolic disorders and inflammatory drivers of AD (Craft, 2009; Karim et al., 2019; Rettberg et al., 2016). Peripheral and brain metabolic dysregulation in midlife is not only a sign of disease vulnerability, but also a predictor of potential disease progression. Emerging evidence from clinical and experimental research also suggests the importance of systemic immune signals and the dynamic concert of brain-peripheral signals in AD pathogenies (Cao and Zheng, 2018; Paouri and Georgopoulos, 2019) with microglia being a critical mediator (Tejera et al., 2019). Peripheral immune response and metabolic regulation are evolutionarily related and functionally integrated (Hotamisligil, 2006). Combination of one or more risk factors and metabo-immune aging phenotypes can lead to 3 outcomes: disease resilience, disease vulnerability, and disease. Understanding the complex and dynamic link between these factors is critical for a precision medicine approach to AD to treat the right person with the right therapy at the right time.

5.1. Sex Differences

Females are at nearly 2-fold greater lifetime risk for AD, even after accounting for greater longevity (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016; Vina and Lloret, 2010). Underlying mechanisms may stem from differential risks for metabolic dysfunction and immune activation, and ultimately risk for AD due to sex differences during midlife aging. The unique endocrinological aging process, the menopausal transition, further exacerbates the risk and prevalence of AD in females (Brinton, 2008; Brookmeyer et al., 1998; Morrison et al., 2006; Ryan et al., 2014). Accumulating evidence supports the negative impact of estrogen loss during menopausal transition as a trigger for an existing AD predisposition, while life-time estrogen exposure may be a protective factor against cognitive decline and AD in females (Brinton et al., 2015; Fisher et al., 2018; Matyi et al., 2019; Paganini-Hill and Henderson, 1994; Rahman et al., 2019; Rahman et al., 2020; Rocca et al., 2007; Rocca et al., 2014).

Women can experience significant brain glucose hypometabolism in several key regions for cognitive function during the perimenopausal transition (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Mosconi et al., 2018a; Mosconi et al., 2018b). Post-menopausal women also exhibit lower brain glucose metabolism as compared to age-controlled males (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Mosconi et al., 2018a; Mosconi et al., 2018b). Loss of estrogen during menopausal transition is further associated with other AD risk phenotypes, including reduced gray matter and white matter volumes, lower platelet mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and increased Aβ load in brain, compared to both pre-menopausal women and men (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Mosconi et al., 2018a; Mosconi et al., 2018b; Rahman et al., 2020). These factors are likely driving contributors to the menopause-associated increase in self-reported subjective cognitive decline (Gold et al., 2000) and changes in objective cognitive performance in some women, particularly verbal memory, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (Berent-Spillson et al., 2012; Epperson et al., 2013; Greendale et al., 2011; Weber et al., 2013). Of interest, for some women, verbal memory rebounded after completion of menopausal transition (Greendale et al., 2009), suggesting a potential successful compensatory adaptation process in a subset of population. Further, loss of estrogen due to premature surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy) is associated with similar memory decline (Abdul-kader et al., 2002; Bove et al., 2014; Hogervorst et al., 2000; LeBlanc et al., 2001; Nappi et al., 1999; Phillips and Sherwin, 1992; Rocca et al., 2007; Sherwin, 1988; Sherwin and Phillips, 1990; Yaffe et al., 1998) and doubled long-term risk of dementia compared to spontaneous menopause (Phung et al., 2010; Rocca et al., 2007), as well as smaller medial temporal lobe volume and reduced connectivity (Zeydan et al., 2019).

Estrogen promotes the metabolic system of biology required for glucose metabolism and aerobic oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation while suppressing activation of adaptive immune signaling. This suggests that estrogen therapy during midlife in symptomatic women could be an effective strategy to reduce risk of AD. Outcomes of population-based analyses indicate that hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms is associated with a 30–50% reduction in risk of AD (Kim and Brinton, 2021; Kim et al., 2021). In contrast, estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women when estrogenic control of the metabolic and immune systems has been dismantled, is not effective for reducing risk nor for treatment of AD (Kim and Brinton, 2021; Kim et al., 2021).

Sex dependent differences in innate and adaptive immunity have long been recognized. Men are more susceptible to bacterial infection and sepsis as well as being at increased risk of mortality from malignant cancers (Klein and Flanagan, 2016). On the other hand, autoimmune disorders have a female bias in incidence (Rizzetto et al., 2018). There is extensive evidence that peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress increase with age. These changes contribute to pathological changes in several organs, including the brain (Furman et al., 2019). Numerous lines of evidence suggest that these changes are exaggerated in women, particularly during the perimenopause and postmenopausal stages of endocrine aging, in part due to the loss of estrogen control of immune and inflammatory processes (Sternberg, 2001; Straub, 2007). Midlife female sex hormone levels and the menopausal transition impact chronic inflammatory profiles and diseases, which can impact neurodegenerative disease risk (Desai and Brinton, 2019; Hoyt and Falconi, 2015). Autoimmune disease risk and trajectory is also affected by menopausal status in women are at an increased risk(Talsania and Scofield, 2017). Immunologically, aging in women is marked by an increase in CD4/CD8 ratios and CD4 T cell circulation (Klein and Flanagan, 2016). Decline in estrogen levels leads to antibody production by B cells, increased secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ from T cells, IL-1β secretion by macrophage and dendritic cells (Straub, 2007). Taken together, these observations suggest that augmented adaptive cellular immunity may contribute to neurodegenerative changes seen in AD and related dementias (ADRD).

In addition to the metabolic and immune molecular mechanisms, hallmark pathologies that characterize Alzheimer’s disease such as beta-amyloid and hyper-phosphorylated tau also exhibit sex differences. During peri- and post- menopause there is an increase in amyloid-beta deposition in women, in comparison to age-matched men (Mosconi et al., 2021). Preclinical analyses and clinical imaging findings in the AD document higher beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary-tau burden in women, and support the role of biological sex and decline in ovarian hormones as drivers of AD pathogenesis (Brinton et a;., 2015; Buckley et al., 2019; Sundermann et al., 2020; Wisch et al., 2021). A recent study conducted in older individuals has showed that clinically healthy women have a greater deposition of tau deposition in entorhinal cortex relative to men (Buckley et al., 2019). Collectively, data from preclinical AD models to humans indicate that the burden of hallmark AD pathologies are greater in women and that earliest indicators of AD risk can emerge during mid-life in women.

While outcomes derived from research conducted in the female brain are not directly translatable to the male brain, the questions addressed in a female centric program of research are directly applicable to investigation of the male brain. Like females, males with AD exhibit deficits in the bioenergetic system of the brain, activation of the immune system and brain atrophy. The drivers and trajectory of mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in the male brain will undoubtedly share common aspects with the female as well as factors unique to the male. To achieve precision medicine for AD, chromosomal sex is a critical variable to consider along with APOE genotype, other genetic risk factors and stage of disease.

5.2. APOE4

APOE4 genotype is the greatest genetic risk factor for late onset AD that not only dictates earlier onset of AD, but also more severe disease progression (Mosconi et al., 2008a; Reiman et al., 2001; Riedel et al., 2016; Small et al., 2000; Small et al., 1995; Wang and Brinton, 2016). APOE4 genotype also has a negative impact on brain development, where healthy APOE4 homozygous children have thinner temporal cortex, smaller hippocampal volumes, lower hippocampal anisotropy, and worse executive function and working memory (Chang et al., 2016; Shaw et al., 2007). From a metabolic perspective, APOE4 genotype is also associated with greater early-stage brain glucose hypometabolism (Mosconi et al., 2008a; Mosconi et al., 2005; Mosconi et al., 2004a; Mosconi et al., 2004b; Mosconi et al., 2004c; Reiman et al., 2001; Reiman et al., 2004, 2005; Valla et al., 2010; Wolf et al., 2013). Young APOE4 carriers have lower brain glucose uptake capacity and faster rate of decline as they age (Mosconi et al., 2008a; Reiman et al., 2004). APOE4 perimenopausal women demonstrate significantly lower metabolic rate compared to APOE3 women and age-controlled males (Mosconi et al., 2017a; Mosconi et al., 2017b; Mosconi et al., 2018a; Mosconi et al., 2018b).

Apolipoprotein E plays a key role in brain lipid transportation and assimilation. APOE4 protein isoform has lower affinity for LDL, which has a negative effect on efficiency of brain lipid metabolism (Qi et al., 2021). At the cellular level, APOE4 positive neurons exhibit significantly diminished efficiency in sequestering lipid droplets and transporting neuronal lipids to astrocytes (Qi et al., 2021). Further, APOE4 astrocytes exhibited lower fatty acid beta oxidation capacity (Qi et al., 2021). As a result, APOE4 carriers may have less flexibility and efficiency in utilizing auxiliary fuel sources in response to glucose hypometabolism (Qi et al., 2021). The reduced lipidation capacity of APOE4 carriers may be further linked to lower neuroprotection and repair capacity in AD patients (Arendt et al., 1997), consistent with greater risk profile of APOE4 for late onset AD.

APOE genotype also interacts with sex to modulate risk for AD (Wang and Brinton, 2016). Female APOE4 carriers are at greater risk for LOAD (Belloy et al., 2019; Farrer et al., 1997; Mishra and Brinton, 2018; Neu et al., 2017; Riedel et al., 2018; Riedel et al., 2016; Wang and Brinton, 2016; Wang et al., 2020a). A recent meta-analysis of 27 independent studies in the Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network confirmed that APOE4 positive women have an accelerated trajectory between 65 and 75 years of age (Neu et al., 2017). Further, APOE4 genotype can interact with the endocrinological transition to generate an exacerbated AD biomarker risk profile, where APOE4 positive perimenopausal and post-menopausal females have higher brain Aβ deposition compared to non-carriers and premenopausal counterparts (Mosconi et al., 2017b). Consistent with the Aβ profile, APOE4 is a driving factor of cognitive decline in healthy perimenopausal women with a poor metabolic profile (Karim et al., 2019; Rettberg et al., 2016; Riedel et al., 2016).

Genetic studies have also elucidated the importance of immune dysregulation in AD. Numerous studies report that APOE4 is also a risk factor for other diseases (Chapman et al., 2001a), including cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Rannikmae et al., 2014), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (Tsuang et al., 2013), tauopathy (Shi et al., 2017), cerebrovascular disease (Treves et al., 1996), multiple sclerosis (Chapman et al., 2001b; Shin et al., 2014), vascular dementia,(Liu et al., 2012; Treves et al., 1996) and a poorer outcome following head injury (Kassam et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015). This may be due to APOE4 induced increased inflammatory responses (Chen et al., 2005; Colton et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2004; Tai et al., 2015). APOE status has also been linked to autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, brain atrophy in multiple sclerosis and severity of rheumatoid arthritis (Coto-Segura et al., 2010; Maehlen et al., 2013; Toms et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010).

APOE genotype is a determining factor in timeline and severity of the autoimmune phenotype in brain(Montagne et al., 2020). The lipid and cholesterol transporter function of ApoE can also impact immune cell function (Bonacina et al., 2018). ApoE exerts an immuno-modulatory effect that causes the inhibition of T cell proliferation on antigen and mitogen activation, downregulation of expression of antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (Bonacina et al., 2018). APOE4 genotype is associated with reduced levels of ApoE and greater predisposition to inflammatory responses (Tai et al., 2015). In apoe knockout mice, cholesterol aggregates within dendritic cells membranes causing increased MHC-II expression and CD4 T cell activation (Bonacina et al., 2018; Mishra and Brinton, 2018). APOE4 allele carriers were found to have increased levels of activated T cells due to the increased expression of antigen presentation molecules in dendritic cells. This effect was mitigated by the introduction of serum from APOE3 carriers (Bonacina et al., 2018).

Consistent with the activation of dendritic cells, microglia and the neuroimmune profile are also impacted by APOE genotype (Shang et al., 2020). Outcomes of hippocampal transcriptomic analysis demonstrate increased microglial reactivity relative to APOE4 genetic burden. The hippocampal transcriptome of humanized (h) female APOE4/4 mice exhibited increased expression of genes (interferon response and MHC) that contribute to an autoimmune profile and consistent with the microglial transcriptomic analyses in the accelerated neurodegeneration model (Mathys et al., 2017). Co-incident with increased expression of inflammatory genes, hAPOE4/4 exhibited increased expression of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and glycolysis indicating a reduction in glucose utilization pathway and increased reliance on auxiliary lipid derived fuels (Shang et al., 2020). Magnitude of dysregulation is associated with increased APOE4 genetic burden and a driver of inflammation and dysregulate the metabolic systems in the brain.

Metabolomic analyses conducted in aged hAPOE3/3 and hAPOE4/4 female mice brain revealed that coincident with the increased interferon and antigen presentation expression, APOE4 females exhibited a metabolic profile indicative of increased utilization of alternate fuel sources as reflected by increased amino acids (AA), glucogenic amino acids, increased acylcarnitine (AC) involved in β-oxidation and increased lyso-phosphatidylcholines (lyso-PC)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio indicating increased breakdown of membranes (Shang et al., 2020). These data are consistent with transcriptomic evidence indicating a metabolic shift in fuel utilization (Shang et al., 2020).

Aging, menopause, and APOE4 genotype each contribute to three hits of chronic low-grade innate inflammation of aging, compromised bioenergetic system of menopause, and adaptive immune response of APOE4 (Mishra and Brinton, 2018). Consistent with preclinical analyses, a large-scale proteomic co-expression network analysis of post-mortem human brains indicated activation of a module enriched for glucose metabolism and glial markers in AD cases, with the APOE4 homozygous sub-group exhibiting the highest expression of this module (Johnson et al., 2020). Both reports are consistent with the dysfunctional neurons and activated glia observed in hAPOE4/4 mouse (Zhu et al., 2012) and AD brains (Long and Holtzman, 2019), and emphasize the importance of devising cell type-specific approaches to investigating mechanisms underlying aging and APOE4 driven metabolic-inflammatory transformations.

5.3. Metabolic Syndrome

Beyond brain glucose hypometabolism, peripheral metabolic syndromes such as insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, dysglycemia, and hypertension are also risk factors for AD and cognitive decline (Rettberg et al, 2014; Baker et al., 2011; Bhatti et al., 2017; Roriz-Cruz et al., 2007), with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress as a potential mechanistic link (reviewed by (Bhatti et al., 2017)). The prevalence and severity of metabolic syndrome increase with endocrinological aging, potentially due to estrogen deficiency, increased circulating androgen, and peripheral metabolic reprograming (Carr, 2003; Gurka et al., 2016; Janssen et al., 2008; Rettberg et al., 2014; Stefanska et al., 2015). Epidemiologic studies have confirmed that metabolic syndrome is associated with increased risk for AD (Razay et al., 2007; Schrijvers et al., 2010), and worse cognitive decline in AD patients (Watts et al., 2013). In longitudinal studies of cognitively normal post-menopausal females, metabolic syndrome interacts with APOE4 genotype to predict worse cognitive decline (Karim et al., 2019; Rettberg et al., 2016).

5.4. Autoimmune diseases

It is well established that autoimmune diseases increase AD risk (Bove, 2013; Wotton and Goldacre, 2017), yet how these peripheral conditions contribute to neurological changes during perimenopause is largely unknown. Although AD is mainly thought of as a neurodegenerative disease, AD also has autoimmune and inflammatory components (Deleidi et al., 2015). Further, the higher prevalence of autoimmune disease in women mirrors that seen in AD (Desai and Brinton, 2019; Klein and Flanagan, 2016; Marder et al., 2015; Pikwer et al., 2012; Smith and Studd, 1992).

Several recent observational studies to better understand early AD risk factors report an association between autoimmune disorders and higher incidence of AD. A significant increase in the risk of dementia was detected in patients with rheumatic diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Chen et al., 2018; Gendelman et al., 2018; Meara et al., 2018). Midlife rheumatoid arthritis is also associated with a higher incidence of dementia (Wallin et al., 2012). In several instances, however, no association between autoimmune diseases and AD was observed (Cai et al., 2018; Policicchio et al., 2017). The authors of these reports noted that the lack of association is likely due to heavy use of anti-inflammatory agents in this population. Consistent with this, recent observational studies suggest that there may be a protective effect against ADRD in autoimmune disease patients treated with conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and therapies that inhibit tumor necrosis factor consistent with anti-inflammatory therapy and associated reduced risk of AD (Judge et al., 2017; McGuinness et al., 2018).

Polymorphisms in genes critical for immune function can contribute to both autoimmune disease and AD risk. For example, polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1, a protein involved in the presentation of epitopes to helper T cells, has been implicated as a genetic risk factor for development of late onset AD (Kunkle et al., 2019; Steele et al., 2017), multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (Harbo et al., 2004; Tsao, 2004). Patients with this polymorphism who develop autoimmune diseases can also develop cognitive decline as the disease progresses (Rich et al., 2004).

During aging, T cell activation, proliferation, and inflammatory cytokine production in response to exposure to Aβ increases. This response is further exacerbated in patients with AD, (Monsonego et al., 2003; Togo et al., 2002) such that 30% of patients whose T cells proliferate in response to Aβ had the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele, which utilized Aβ29–42 as an epitope (Monsonego et al., 2003). More recently, it has been shown that B cells, hematopoietic cells that generate antibodies, also present antigen, and express neurodegeneration-associated proteins (Nataf et al., 2019). Further, B cells expressing HLA-DRB1*1501 allele, bind to peptides derived from microtubule associated protein tau and presenilin (Nataf et al., 2019). While this function may contribute to tolerance to these proteins early in life, with age this response may lead to increased inflammation and T cell activation causing immunogenic response to the proteins that contribute to AD pathology, further worsening the risk profile for AD.

6. Conclusion

Mid-life aging transitions can be a tipping point for late-onset AD risk. Emergence of brain glucose hypometabolism during mid-life initiates an adaptative starvation response which can put the lipid reservoir of brain, the white matter, at risk for catabolism to generate ketone bodies as an auxiliary fuel. The systematic transition to an auxiliary fuel source, involves an orchestrated sequence of immune and metabolic signaling cascades to support the fuel demands of brain function and survival. To this end, the immune and metabolic systems are partners in cellular metabolic reprogramming. The dismantling of the estrogen control of glucose metabolism during mid-life aging in women is a critical contributor to the shift in fuel systems and emergence of dynamic neuroimmune phenotype (Fig. 2). The APOE4 genotype accelerates the tipping point for bioenergetic crisis in brain. Collectively, outcomes from decades of mechanistic discovery, translational and clinical research indicate that midlife aging is a critical period that can set the stage for emergence of resilience against or risk for AD in later life. These data provide the foundation on which to create a precision medicine approach to prevent and delay Alzheimer’s disease in women and the framework to establish the same foundation of research in men.

Metabolic system and immune system are partners in aging reprograming. Activation of innate immune system kick starts the early chronological aging, followed by decrease in brain glucose metabolism. Increased fatty acid metabolism is associated with increased adaptive immune response during endocrinological aging. Late chronological aging sees winding down of both metabolic and immune system activities. In women APOE4 carriers, reduction in brain glucose metabolism, increase in amyloid-beta deposition during the perimenopause is followed by an increase in Interferon (IFN) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) expression.
