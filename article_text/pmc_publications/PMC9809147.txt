Early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease may result in part from synaptic dysfunction caused by the accumulation oligomeric assemblies of amyloid β-protein (Aβ). Changes in hippocampal function seem critical for cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Diffusible oligomers of Aβ (oAβ) have been shown to block canonical long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of hippocampus, but whether there is also a direct effect of oAβ on synaptic transmission and plasticity at synapses between mossy fibers (axons) from the dentate gyrus granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons (mf-CA3 synapses) is unknown. Studies in APP transgenic mice have suggested an age-dependent impairment of mossy fiber LTP. Here we report that although endogenous AD brain-derived soluble oAβ had no effect on mossy-fiber basal transmission, it strongly impaired paired-pulse facilitation in the mossy fiber pathway and presynaptic mossy fiber LTP (mf-LTP). Selective activation of both β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway prevented oAβ-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP. Unexpectedly, activation of the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway also prevented oAβ-impaired mf-LTP. Our results reveal certain specific pharmacological targets to ameliorate human oAβ-mediated impairment at the mf-CA3 synapse.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a globally prevalent, age-related disorder characterized by extracellular deposits (amyloid plaques) of diverse assemblies of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ) as well as intraneuronal deposits (neurofibrillary tangles) of the microtubule-associated protein, tau. Neurofibrillary tangles, the abundance of which correlates with cognitive symptoms, are found initially in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala and other limbic regions and later spread to neocortical regions. The severity of cognitive deficits correlates better with the levels of soluble forms of Aβ than with those of insoluble amyloid plaques (Lue et al., 1999; McLean et al., 1999). Experimentally, aqueously soluble oligomers of Aβ (oAβ) have consistently been shown to block long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of hippocampus, an extensively validated electrophysiological correlate of learning and memory (Gulisano et al., 2018; Lambert et al., 1998; Li et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Shankar et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002).

Aβ-neutralizing and -clearing antibodies are currently emerging as the first potentially disease-modifying therapeutics for AD. Therefore, obtaining a deeper understanding of the molecular signaling and neurobiological mechanisms of β-amyloidosis becomes even more important for precision medicine in this highly common disease. To this end, we have conducted a novel analysis of the understudied dentate granule-mossy fiber-CA3 neuroanatomical pathway in the hippocampus and describe its vulnerability to impairment by oAβ obtained directly from human ((AD) brain.

The hippocampus has a crucial role in mammalian learning and memory. The main input to the hippocampus is provided by the dentate gyrus (Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005). Information reaches neurons of the CA3 region through mossy fiber mf) synapses made by dentate granule cell axons that have been proposed to participate in the rapid encoding of contextual memories (Kesner, 2007; Nakashiba et al., 2008; Nakazawa et al., 2003; Lee and Kesner, 2004; Shahola et al., 2022), a mnemonic process particularly affected in AD patients. MF-CA3 synapses exhibit an important feature of presynaptic plasticity involving prominent short-term plasticity and a form of LTP that is independent of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (in contrast to canonical CA1 LTP) and requires activation of β-adrenergic receptors as well as downstream cAMP/PKA signaling cascades (Henze et al., 2002; Salin et al., 1996; Huang and Kandel, 1996). oAβ is already known to impair LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus through the cAMP/PKA/CREB or cGMP/PKG/CREB pathways (see e.g., Vitolo et al., 2002; Puzzo et al., 2005). Several studies have observed an age-dependent impairment of mossy fiber LTP in APP transgenic mice, including for example 12 mo transgenic AAP/PS1 mice and 24 mo Tg2576 mice (Maingret et al., 2017; Witton et al., 2010). However, it is not possible to definitively attribute these changes in mice to oAβ per se, as heterogenous Aβ species and many secondary effectors are present in vivo. Here, we asked for the first time whether application of natural soluble oAβ species isolated directly from human (AD) cortex can affect mf-LTP in wild-type (WT) mouse hippocampal slices. We find that AD-brain-derived oAβ potently blocks mf-LTP and that this involves second-messenger pathways that include presynaptic cAMP/PKA and cGMP/PKG.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Mice

Both male and female C57BL/6 J mice were used. All procedures involving mice were in accordance with the animal welfare guidelines of The Harvard Medical School and Brigham Women’s hospital.

2.2. Extracellular field recordings

Experiments were performed as previously described (Li et al., 2018). Briefly, mice (ages 1–3 mo) were anesthetized with halothane and decapitated. Transverse acute hippocampal slices (350 μm) were cut in ice-cold oxygenated sucrose-enhanced artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 206 mM sucrose, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4. After dissection, slices were incubated in ACSF that contained the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 10 D-glucose saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4), in which they were allowed to recover for at least 90 min before recording. Recordings were performed in the same solution at room temperature in a chamber submerged in ACSF. To record field EPSPs (fEPSPs) in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, standard procedures were used. A unipolar stimulating electrode (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) was placed in the hilus region close to the dentate granule cell layer to stimulate mossy fiber axons. A borosilicate glass recording electrode filled with ACSF was positioned in stratum lucidum of CA3, 250–350 μm from the stimulating electrode. AP5 (50 μM) was added in ACSF to prevent contamination with the NMDA receptor-dependent pathway converging on CA3 neurons. Test stimuli were applied at low frequency (0.05 Hz) at a stimulus intensity that elicited a fEPSP amplitude that was 40–50% of maximum and the test responses were recorded for 10 min before the experiment was begun to ensure stability of the response. Once a stable test response was attained, experimental treatments, 0.5 mL AD brain Tris-buffered saline (TBS) soaking extracts without or with various drugs were added to the 9.5 mL ACSF perfusate, and a baseline was recorded for an additional 30 min. For the Anti-Aβ antibodies experiments, the 71A1 or 1G5 antibodies were added to the AD brain extract aliquots incubated with mixing for 30 min, then adding to the mixture to brain slice perfusion buffer. To induce mf-LTP, two consecutive trains (1 s) of stimuli at 100 Hz separated by 20 s were applied to the slices. Traces were obtained by pClamp 11 and analyzed using the Clampfit 11. Data analysis was as follows. The fEPSP magnitude was measured using the initial fEPSP slope and three consecutive slopes (1 min) were averaged and normalized to the mean value recorded 10 min before conditioning stimulus. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Significant differences were determined using one-way ANOVA test with post hoc Tukey’s test or unpaired student’s t-test.

3. Results

3.1. oAβ from AD brain extracts alters short-term plasticity in the mossy fiber pathway and impairs mossy fiber LTP, and certain Aβ antibodies can prevent this

We demonstrated previously that AD brain-derived soluble Aβ oligomers (oAβ) consistently prevent LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus (Shankar et al., 2008; Li et al., 2018; Hong et al., 2018). However, the effects of AD brain-derived soluble oAβ on LTP in the mossy fiber (mf) pathway, where axons (mossy fibers) project from DG granule cells to synapse on CA3 neurons, remain untested. We systematically assessed whether oAβ isolated from AD cerebral cortex alters mf-LTP in WT mouse hippocampal slices. We prepared AD cortical extracts (AD 1 and AD2) using the recently described 30-min “soaking” protocol on minced cortical bits, which avoids tissue homogenization that would break up myriad plaque cores and yields an aqueous extract enriched in highly diffusible, bioactive forms of oAβ (Hong et al., 2018). Addition of AD 1 or AD2 at 5% (v:v) to the aCSF slice perfusate resulted in significantly reduced mf-LTP compared to the aCSF control (Fig. 1). Recently, we reported that the strongly oligomer-preferring Aβ antibodies 71A1 and 1G5 protect against the oAβ-induced LTP block in CA1 of wt hippocampal slices (Liu et al., 2021). Here we found that 71A1 (2.12 μg/mL) or 1G5 (2 μg/mL) each fully rescued the suppression of mossy fiber LTP mediated by AD 1 or AD2 when simply added to the slice perfusate with these extracts (Fig. 1A, B; quantified in C). These results indicate that diffusible oAβ from AD brain impairs mf-LTP, and monoclonal antibodies specific for oAβ (they bind to monomers &gt;100-fold less avidly (Liu et al., 2021) can protect against this.

To assess whether oAβ alters basal synaptic transmission, we measured input/output curves over a broad range of stimulus intensities (25–1000 μA) against the resulting fEPSP slope and found no significant differences between aCSF and oAβ-rich AD soaking extracts (Fig. 1D). However, we did observe a significantly reduced paired-pulse ratio of fEPSP slope at 10–100 ms inter-pulse intervals in human oAβ-treated slices, compared with the typical paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) seen in control aCSF-treated slices (Fig. 1E). PPF is a measure of short-term plasticity and presynaptic efficacy. The changes in paired-pulse facilitation indicate presynaptic involvement in the effects of oAβ on mossy fiber LTP. This result suggests that oAβ impairs mf LTP in part through presynaptic mechanisms.

3.2. Prevention of oAβ-impaired mf-LTP by activating β-AR or their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway

In vitro studies have shown that modulation of β-adrenergic receptors (AR) is a crucial upstream event for inducing mf-LTP. Activation of β-AR can induce mf-LTP, while antagonism of β-AR blocks it (Hopkins and Johnston, 1988; Huang and Kandel, 1996). β-Adrenergic responses are proposed to be mediated by activation of a cAMP cascade (Fig. 2A). To assess whether oAβ-mediated mf-LTP inhibition can be prevented by activation of β-AR and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling, we treated hippocampal slices with AD soaking brain extracts mixed with a non-selective agonist of β-AR, isoproterenol (ISO, 1 μM) alone or with an inhibitor of PKA, KT5720 (1 μM). The results showed full recovery of mf- LTP by ISO, but the rescue did not occur in the presence of KT5720 (Fig. 2B). We next examined the effects of activating cAMP/PKA signaling with the phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, Rolipram or GSK256066; the latter is a potent and tight-binding inhibitor of PDE4B with an apparent IC50 of 3.2 pM (Tralau-Stewart et al., 2011). Rolipram at 3 μM (but not at 0.1 μM) prevented the inhibition of mf-LTP by oAβ when added to the slice perfusate with the soluble AD brain extracts (Fig. 2C); 3 μM is known to increase cAMP concentration in hippocampal slices (Barad et al., 1998). Likewise, GSK256066 at 1 nM (but not at 150 pM) prevented mf-LTP inhibition by oAβ (Fig. 2D). Next, we investigated the effect of oAβ on activation of cAMP/PKA signaling by the adenylyl cyclase activator, Forskolin. Forskolin (FSK, 5 μM) induced potentiation by progressively increasing mf-fEPSP slope, and oAβ did not inhibit this forskolin-induced potentiation (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results suggest that soluble oAβ from AD brain inhibit mossy fiber LTP, and this can be prevented by activation of β-AR and the downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.

3.3. oAβ impairment of mf-LTP is prevented by activation of β1AR or β2AR

Previous studies reported that the subtypes of βAR, namely β1 and β2AR, are important for hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Yang et al., 2002; Gelinas et al., 2008; Hagena et al., 2016). To assess the contribution of the two β-AR subtypes to the impairment of mf-LTP by oAβ, we used different selective β1AR and β2AR agonists and antagonists (Fig. 3A). First, Xamoterol (1 μM), a selective β1-AR partial agonist, prevented the inhibition of mf-LTP when co-administered with AD soaking brain extracts (Fig. 3B). In accord, a selective β 1AR antagonist, atenolol (2 μM), blocked the rescue by ISO of mf-LTP (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the selective β2AR agonists Procaterol (0.1 μM) and Formaterol (0.1 μM) each rescued mf-LTP suppression by the AD brain extracts (Fig. 3D). A selective β2AR antagonist, ICI-118,551 (0.1 μM) blocked the ISO-rescued mf-LTP (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that the rescue of oAβ-impaired mf-LTP requires activation of both β1and β2AR.

3.4. Prevention of oAβ-impaired mf-LTP by activation of cGMP-PKG signaling pathway

Synthetic Aβ peptides (in particular, aggregated Aβ1–42) have been reported to impair CA1 LTP in part via the cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway (Puzzo et al., 2005). Our prior studies applying human brain oAβ-rich extracts indicate that their synaptotoxic and neuritotoxic potency is perhaps &gt;100-fold more than that of synthetic Aβ aggregates (Jin et al., 2011) We therefore investigated a possible role for the cGMP-PKG pathway in protecting against natural oAβ-induced impairment of mf-LTP. We found that cGMP elevation through a 30 min application of sildenafil (50 nM), a specific PDE5 inhibitor (Fig. 4A) (Acquarone et al., 2019), prevented the inhibition of mf-LTP by oAβ. This effect of sildenafil was blocked by co-perfusion with the PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-cGMPS (10 μM) (Fig. 4B). These results show that the prevention of oAβ-impaired mf-LTP by activation of the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway in parallel with the cAMP/PKA pathway.

4. Discussion

The major new findings in the present study are as follows. First, soluble Aβ oligomers (oAβ) isolated directly from AD brains impair presynaptic long-term plasticity at mf-CA3 synapses. Second, the strongly oligomer-preferring Aβ antibodies 71A1 and 1G5 protect against the oAβ-induced mf-LTP block. Third, activation of the β1AR or β2AR and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathways can prevent oAβ-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP. Fourth, activation of the cGMP/PKG signaling pathway also can restore Aβ-impaired mf-LTP. Fifth, oAβ reduces PPF at 10–100 ms inter-pulse intervals in the mossy fiber pathway.

Synaptic dysfunction and/or loss have been hypothesized to be the principal basis for cognitive impairment in AD, in particular during the early stage of the disease (reviewed in Selkoe, 2002). The CA3 pyramidal cells (PC) receive mossy fiber inputs from DG granule cells. mf-CA3 synapses appear to be required for acquisition of contextual memories (Rolls, 2013; Shahola et al., 2022), and there is evidence for a role of mf-CA3 synapses in encoding new spatial information. Alterations in mf-CA3 synaptic function in the context of AD have only been studied in APP transgenic mice, including for example 12 mo transgenic AAP/PS1 mice and 24 mo Tg2576 mice (Maingret et al., 2017; Witton et al., 2010). Our study demonstrates for first time that presynaptic mf-LTP is specifically inhibited by AD brain-derived soluble Aβ oligomers in the hippocampus of WT mice. The source of Aβ peptides we used in this study is from highly disease-relevant human (AD) brain tissue. These soluble (‘soaking’) brain extracts contain heterogeneous Aβ monomers and dimers and higher oligomers (Hong et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Sebollela et al., 2017; Shankar et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2017). Analyses of such oAβ-rich extracts from human brain indicate that their synaptotoxic and neuritotoxic potency is perhaps ~100-fold greater than that of synthetic Aβ aggregates (Jin et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017). We found the oAβ from diffusible AD brain extracts can significantly reduce paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). PPF is a measure of short-term plasticity and a change in PPF is frequently used as an indication of presynaptic involvement in long-term potentiation. So, our study suggests oAβ impairs mf LTP in part through presynaptic mechanisms.

In vitro studies have shown that β-adrenergic receptor activation and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling modulates the early phase of mf- LTP via a presynaptic mechanism (Huang and Kandel, 1996). Our work shows that isoproterenol (ISO) can fully prevent oAβ-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP, but that rescue is blocked by the PKA inhibitor KT5720. We show that activation of β1AR or β2AR can prevent oAβ-mediated inhibition of mf-LTP by detailing the pharmacological the effects of β1AR or β2AR agonists and antagonists on this. These data provide strong evidence that these treatments prevent synaptic dysfunction induced by oAβ through activation of β1AR or β2AR and their downstream cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.

Another important finding of our study is that increases in intracellular cAMP or cGMP levels by inhibiting phosphodiesterases (PDEs) can restore oAβ-impaired mf-LTP. PDEs are grouped into 11 families based on homology of their catalytic domains, with most families containing more than one gene (Bender and Beavo, 2006). Some PDEs specifically hydrolyze cAMP (PDE4, PDE7 and PDE8) while others specifically hydrolyze cGMP (PDE5, PDE6 and PDE9) (Francis et al., 2011). We found that the PDE4 inhibitors, Rolipram or GSK256066 can prevent the inhibition of mf-LTP by oAβ when added to the slice perfusate together with the AD brain extracts. Furthermore, a surprising finding was that cGMP elevation through sildenafil (50 nM), a specific PDE5 inhibitor (Acquarone et al., 2019), prevented the mf-LTP inhibition by oAβ, and the effect of sildenafil was blocked by co-perfusion with the PKG inhibitor, Rp-8-Br-cGMPS. This finding is consistent with evidence that synthetic Aβ peptides (Aβ1–42) impair CA1 LTP in part via the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway (Puzzo et al., 2005).

5. Conclusion

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that presynaptic mf-LTP is inhibited by applying AD brain-derived oAβ, and this can be prevented by certain oAβ antibodies, by β1AR or β2AR agonists and by PDE4 or PDE5 inhibitors. Together, these findings help identify a presynaptic form of LTP in which interrelated signaling pathways mediate the multifaceted synaptotoxicity of oAβ, suggesting several specific pharmacological targets to ameliorate oAβ-mediated impairment.
