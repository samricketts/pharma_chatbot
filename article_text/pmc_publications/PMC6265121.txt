Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a progressive and disproportionate loss of visual functions associated with neurodegeneration of posterior cortical regions {1,2}. Recent Consensus Criteria for PCA emphasize visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficits, relative sparing of memory and other cognitive functions, and posterior cortical abnormalities on neuroimaging {2}. The most common cause of PCA is an early-onset visual variant of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {3}. Although there is no treatment for PCA or clear response to Alzheimer medications, psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) could potentially improve their difficulty shifting spatial attention and, hence, improve their overall functioning {4}. MPH could also potentially improve the ability of PCA patients to overcome their lack of motivation and withdrawal consequent to their visuospatial limitations. We present three patients with PCA who improved with MPH.

PATIENT 1

A 56 year-old woman presented with two-years of progressive visual localization difficulty particularly affecting dressing and driving. On dressing, she could not pick out her clothes or put her arms through the sleeves. On driving, she could not stay in her lane, appropriately stop at stop signs, or park her car. Her examination included a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 21/30 {5}. She had normal language and memory, but had marked abnormalities on drawings and tasks involving overlapping or Gestalt figures, visual search, and letter location. Her neurological examination was otherwise normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested PCA, evident as parietal and posterior temporal hypometabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Figure 1A). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD (β42 amyloid, total tau, phosph-tau) confirmed PCA due to AD {6}, and she was treated with donepezil (10mg/daily) and memantine (XR 28mg/daily) and received varying doses of escitalopram for mood and anxiety.

After two years, she had become poorly motivated beyond any depression or problems with her mood. She had remained on donepezil and memantine, without clear response, but her mood and anxiety had improved on the escitalopram. She felt severely limited in activity by the visuospatial deficits of Balint syndrome (simultanagnosia, oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia) with inability to locate even food and utensils placed before her. She was started on MPH (5mg twice/day), and become significantly more active. Although her visuospatial deficits and examination did not improve, for the first time in several years she began spending significantly more time with her children, exercising, and socializing with friends.

PATIENT 2

A 57 year-old woman presented with four-years of progressive visuospatial difficulties, such as localizing nobs and finding words on pages. These included inability to use controls or keyboard, find signature block on paperwork, and read more than two lines on a page before the “words disappear”. On examination, her MMSE was 13/30, but her language was intact and memory was mild-moderately impaired. Her main deficits were on visuospatial tasks including drawings and visual search-localization. The rest of the neurological examination was intact. Brain MRI suggested PCA, and FDG-PET showed temporoparietal and occipital hypometabolism (Figure 1B). CSF biomarkers were consistent with AD, and she was treated with donepezil (10mg/day), memantine (10mg/twice daily), and escitalopram 10mg/day for depression with anxiety.

After two years, her mood was generally euthymic but had become inactive and disengaged, primarily due to Balint syndrome and visuospatial constraints. She had remained on donepezil and memantine, without definite response, but she was euthymic with minimal reported anxiety on the escitalopram. She was started on MPH (5mg/twice daily). Although her visuospatial deficits and examination did not improve, her family described her as significantly initiating more activities and walking more and, to their surprise, even able to do more than one task at a time.

PATIENT 3

A 62 year-old woman presented with one-year of progressive visuospatial difficulties localizing buttons on phones and items on desks, environmental disorientation, and inability to drive. She described difficulty voting because of inability to locate the dots on the punch ballot. On examination, she had an MMSE score of 27/30, intact language, and mildly impaired memory. But, she could not do simple drawings, interpret overlapping or crosshatched figures, and localize dots or letters. The neurological examination was otherwise normal. Brain MRI scan was non-diagnostic, but FDG-PET showed parietal hypometabolism (Figure 1C). An amyloid PET scan was positive for amyloid neuritic plaques, consistent with PCA due to AD {6}. Treatment included donepezil (10 mg/day) and memantine (XR 28 mg/day) and several antidepressants for both depression and anxiety.

After three years, the patient had apathy out-of-proportion to any other evidence of depression or anxiety and consistent with pronounced and quite limiting visuospatial difficulties. She had remained on donepezil and memantine with little response, but the addition of MPH (5mg BID) resulted in rapid improvement with increased engagement with her children, taking trips, and participating in physical activities. She went camping with her children, took up physical exercise, and attended a college reunion.

DISCUSSION

Treatment with a low-dose MPH helped these PCA patients without any reported adverse effects. Although their examination, including attention and visuospatial deficits, were not improved, they became motivated and involved in activities. This observation is important, because there is no effective treatment for these patients, and they withdraw and disengage because they are effectively visually impaired. The lack of motivation and initiation is often disproportionate to the effects on their mood, and may not respond to antidepressant medications.

Prior work has shown improvement with MPH in AD {7–10}. Apathy and poor motivation are common in AD, including PCA due to AD, and may result from dysfunction in the dopaminergic brain reward system, as well as from perceived inability to function in their visual environments. Early work suggested that negative symptoms in dementia patients, independent of depression, were responsive to MPH treatment {11}. Subsequent randomized, double-blind trails in mild-to-moderate AD outpatients with MPH (20mg/day), and an open-labeled study, have reported improvements on apathy scores {7–10}. MPH may be particularly helpful among patients with the PCA variant of AD, who become poorly motivated to initiate activities due to limiting visuospatial impairments. Moreover, these investigations suggest that MPH may also improve attention, depression, and decision-making behavior in dementias {12}.

This preliminary report and the prior literature highlights the need for research on the use of MPH or other psychostimulants in the PCA variant of AD or other forms of visual impairment from brain disease.
