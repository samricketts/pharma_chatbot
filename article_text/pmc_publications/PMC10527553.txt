As the global population ages, the prevalence of cognitive decline and dementia is expected to rise, creating a significant health and economic burden. The purpose of this trial is to rigorously test, for the first time, the efficacy of yoga training as a physical activity intervention to mitigate age-related cognitive decline and impairment. We are conducting a 6-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) of exercise among 168 middle aged and older adults to compare the efficacy of yoga vs. aerobic exercise on cognitive function, brain structure and function, cardiorespiratory fitness, and circulating inflammatory and molecular markers. Using a single-blind, three arm RCT, 168 older adults ages 55–79 will be assigned to either: a Hatha yoga group, an aerobic exercise group or a stretching and strengthening active control group. Participants will engage in hour long group exercise 3x/week for 6-months. A comprehensive neurocognitive test battery, brain imaging, cardiovascular fitness test, and a blood draw will take place at baseline; end of the 6-month intervention, and at 12-month follow-up. Our primary outcomes of interest are brain regions, such as hippocampal volume and prefrontal cortex, and cognitive functions, such as episodic memory, working memory and executive functions, that are typically affected by aging and Alzheimer’s Disease. Not only will this RCT test whether yoga is a means to mitigate age-related cognitive decline, but it may also offer an alternative to aerobic exercise, which could be particularly appealing to older adults with compromised physical functioning.


pmc1. Introduction

Older adults are the fastest growing population in the US. It is estimated that by 2035, the US will have 78 million older adults aged 65 years or older edging our children in population size [1]. The aging of the population is expected to have wide-ranging medical, societal and economic implications for the country. Typical age-related declines in physical function and cognitive health are among the most salient characteristics and consequences of aging. Independently and collectively, these two factors can result in loss of independence and compromised quality of life. Age is the greatest risk factor for cognitive impairment, and for Alzheimer’s disease which is the most common cause of dementia in older adults [2]. As human life expectancy increases, maintaining one’s cognitive abilities is key to assuring the quality of those added years.

Physical activity is one therapeutic approach that has been effectively tested to remediate age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, moderate intensity aerobic exercise has emerged as a promising low-cost method for improving neurocognitive function in older adults [3]. However, older adults often present comorbidities such as cancer, arthritis and other skeletal muscle and bone health-related conditions. Yoga is a holistic mind-body exercise, which is becoming increasingly popular among older adults. With the increasing population of older adults in the US, there is a need to not only test popular modes of exercise such as yoga, but also compare their efficacy to scientifically proven interventions such as aerobic exercise to improve cognitive health. To our knowledge, this will be the first randomized control trial (RCT) examining and comparing the effects of yoga with aerobic exercise training on behavioral and neurobiological correlates of cognitive function. Our study will determine the efficacy of yoga in improving cognitive and brain health of older adults and if proven effective, the gentle and amenable nature of yoga could have greater appeal for older adults as compared to traditional aerobic or resistance training.

Yoga is a holistic, mind–body activity that has components centering on meditation, breathing, and postures. Although its historical origins are in ancient Indian philosophy, it has gained popularity in Western countries. Hatha yoga is considered the foundation of all other yoga practices or styles; therefore, we refer to Hatha yoga in this manuscript simply as “yoga”. The recent National Health Interview Survey identified yoga as the most popular form of mind-body practice used by 14.3% (32.5 million) US adults [4]. The use of yoga and other complementary and alternative medicine therapies is becoming increasingly popular, especially among older adults who use these therapies for aging-related chronic conditions such as back pain, arthritis, anxiety, depression, and cancer [5–8]. Although yoga practice involves physical postures that mimic stretching, balance, and strength exercises, resulting in physical benefits [9,10], it also includes an active attentional components of breathing and meditation. Given the age-related declines in cognitive function [11], and in comparison to the corpus of evidence for aerobic exercise, little is known about the potential of yoga for maintaining or enhancing cognitive function in older adults. Meta-analysis and systematic reviews of yoga and cognition [12,13] have reported positive changes in domains of attention, processing speed, executive function and memory among older adults. However, the studies in the literature are limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous population characteristics, varied doses of yoga interventions, lack of active control groups, inconsistent use of cognitive tests and a lack of physiological and mechanistic understanding of the yoga-cognition relationship. This RCT will address each of these limitations and add to our limited understanding of the yoga-cognition relationship and will also compare the effectiveness of yoga with the well-established aerobic training effects on cognitive function.

1.1 Specific Aims

Our first aim will examine improvements in neurocognitive performance. Using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, we will examine whether a 6-month aerobic and yoga intervention improve cognitive performance in older adults as compared to an active control group. Our second aim will examine changes in brain structure and function. Using MRI, we will examine whether a 6-month aerobic and yoga intervention affects brain structure, vasculature and neuronal connectivity in older adults as compared to the active control group. Our exploratory aim three is to examine the mediating role of five physiological biomarkers identified from the literature [14,15] for their role in cognitive health - Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), Cortisol, Inflammatory markers of IL-6 and CRP, Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Insulin resistance.

2. Methods

2.1 Participant Recruitment and Screening

Study recruitment began in January 2021 via local newspapers, radio stations, flyers and targeted postcard mailings, and advertisements on online media around the Champaign-Urbana communities. Recruitment, screening and randomization will take place in cohorts. The target enrollment for the trial is 168 participants with approximately 20% minorities and 60% females. Participants who respond to the study advertisements will undergo a telephone screening based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in Table 1. Briefly, participants will be included in the trial if they are between 55–79 years, ambulatory, low active, no cognitive impairment, Telephone Inventory of Cognitive Status-modified score of 32 or higher [16], physician’s consent to participate in moderate intensity exercise, not currently being treated for neurological diseases, and MRI-safe (i.e., no metal implants). Being non-active will be defined as self-reporting not engaging in regular physical activity, including yoga on more than two days (30 or more mins) of the week in the last six months. We based our criteria on past studies examining exercise and cognition among healthy older adults [17,18] in order to allow for comparisons across studies.

2.2 Study Assessments

Participants who complete phone screening and are deemed eligible will be scheduled for 5 study appointments: 1) Mock MRI and orientation (1 hour) - a brief presentation about the study that aligns with the information presented in the informed consent for participants to ask questions and seek clarifications and offering participants the option to get in and out of a mock MRI machine to determine their tolerance. 2) Cognitive testing (1.5 hours) - behavioral assessment of cognitive function via computer based and paper pencil tests detailed below. 3) Cardiorespiratory fitness (1 hour) - a graded exercise test in the presence of a clinical exercise physiologist or physician. 4) MRI (1.5 hours) - complete structural and functional MRI sequences at the University’s Biomedical Imaging Center. 5) Blood draw (0.5 hours) - standard antecubital venipuncture.

2.3 Measures

All participants will complete all study assessments at baseline (month 0), end of the intervention (month 6) and follow-up (month 12). Participants will be compensated for their time and parking will be covered for all study assessment visits as well as the intervention sessions. Although month 6 is our primary timepoint, we chose to collect the measures at three time-points because it will allow an assessment of trajectory and examination of maintenance effects.

Health History and Baseline Demographics.

Each subject will complete a standard health history questionnaire assessing medical history and lifestyle habits prior to recruitment into the study. Participants will be asked to review these data at 6- and 12-month testing appointments to document any subsequent changes to their health. A demographic questionnaire will be administered at baseline to assess basic participant information such as age, martial and socioeconomic status, educational level and living status. These data will be used as covariates in our analyses where prudent.

Cognitive Performance.

Our proposed battery consists of established measures of executive function, attention, processing speed, working memory and episodic memory. Each of these measures have been used in the aerobic exercise and cognition literature [19,20] and we have included and expanded on the battery of tasks used in our yoga based preliminary studies. Some of these tasks are also part of the NIH toolbox (e.g. Flanker task) and the Virginia Cognitive Aging Project (e.g. word recall), one of the largest active longitudinal studies of typical cognitive aging. Longitudinal studies have shown that these tests are sensitive to typical age-related cognitive changes [21] and our preliminary data suggest that they are sensitive to exercise effects. The battery takes ~1.25 hours to complete and participants will be encouraged to take breaks between the tasks to reduce fatigue. The tasks and the corresponding cognitive domains that they assess are detailed in Table 2.

Magnetic Resonance Neuroimaging Protocol.

All MRI data will be collected on a Siemens 3T Prisma MR machine with a 64-channel head coil and physiological recording is included for the resting state fMRI scans. Anatomical, functional, diffusion, and blood flow scans are obtained as described in Table 3 below. fMRI and diffusion scans are acquired using the Center for Magnetic Resonance Research multiband EPI sequences [22–24]. For each of the fMRI and diffusion scans, we additionally acquired a spin echo sequence with 3 time-points with alternating phase encoding to estimate a field map (or B0 map) to correct for magnetic susceptibility effects using top-up [25]; FSL 6.0.5.1:57b01774). For the ASL sequence, we additionally acquired an asymmetric spin echo 2D spiral acquisition with multiple echo times to estimate the field map.

Functional MRI and anatomical MRI preprocessing will be performed using fMRIPrep 22.0.1 [26], which is based on Nipype 1.8.4 [27,28]. The full descriptions of these preprocessing workflows are available online (https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/workflows.html) and the code used accessible at https://github.com/mrfil/pipeline-hpc/tree/SAY.

Anatomical analyses:

The FreeSurfer pipeline using its longitudinal option will be employed to compute cortical and subcortical volumes, cortical surface area, and thickness. Intracranial volume will be used as a covariate in all analyses of brain morphology.

Task-evoked activation:

Our pilot results demonstrated that both walking and yoga interventions improve performance on the n-back working memory paradigm [29,30] and that these effects are highly reliable. This task also engages a broad network of regions that we expect to be influenced by our interventions including the PFC, ACC, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. In this task, participants determine whether a lowercase letter matches the letter on the previous trial (1-back) or the letter two trials previously (2-back). One-back and 2-back conditions are presented in 4 quasi-randomized blocks of 45 secs with 20-sec fixation periods presented between each task block. We plan to assess intervention-related effects on these data using a combination of approaches. We will employ traditional general linear models via the xcpEngine [31], including confound regression and implementation of FSL FEAT using fMRIPrep preprocessed data (described above). Multiple comparisons will be corrected using standard voxel (p&lt;.01) and cluster-based methods.

Resting state analyses:

We will calculate functional connectivity using a region-of-interest (ROI) approach. Coordinates for the ROIs are taken from the extant literature and include: the posterior hippocampus and posterior cingulate [32], anterior hippocampus [33], medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex [34], and amygdala [35]. The selection of ROIs is based on studies that found regionally specific effects of mind-body and exercise interventions in two brain systems involved in executive and attentional control, and stress reactivity and emotion regulation. The mean time course is extracted for each ROI and functional connectivity is determined using Fisher’s Z transformed Pearson’s r correlations.

Hippocampal subfields:

For hippocampal subfield measures, we will apply the Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) method to automatically differentiate subfields of the hippocampus [36]. Animal studies have found that the dentate gyrus and CA1 subfields are more frequently affected by exercise [37,38] and our prior research suggests that the head of the hippocampus is affected more than the tail [39]. Hence, this imaging and analysis procedure will provide us the ability to probe the role of finer localization of hippocampal structural change after the proposed interventions.

Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF):

Analysis of the ASL data will be performed in BASIL in FSL [40] . The first image of the ASL acquisition includes an image with no background suppression or ASL tagging, resulting in a calibration M0 image. We will model partial volume effects in the data based on the segmentation of the T1 MPRAGE [41]. We will quantify cerebral blood flow (CBF) and arterial transit time (ATT), which is enabled through the multiple post-labeling delays (TI2) that are acquired in the protocol.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH):

Using the T2 FLAIR sequence, we will quantify WMH along with using the results to rule out significant small-vessel disease that is relatively common in older adults [42], and may have significant implications for cognitive functions [43]. We will use an automated WMH segmentation method that leverages FSL using the T2 FLAIR and T1 MPRAGE to create WMH masks for each subject [44].

Diffusion weighted processing:

Preprocessing and diffusion reconstruction will be performed using QSIPrep 0.16.1, which is based on Nipype 1.6.1 [27,28], Nilearn 0.8.1 [45], and Dipy [46]. Diffusion orientation distribution functions are reconstructed using generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) [47] with a ratio of mean diffusion distance of 1.250.

Diffusion Connectivity Analysis:

Structural connectivity matrices created by the GQI reconstruction will be used to test the strength and efficiency [48] of structural connectivity for the regions of interest examined in resting-state connectivity analyses. These will be compared pre- and post-intervention and at follow-up time-points.

All MRI data are transferred to the XNAT server at the data collection site for quality control assessment within 24 h of collection. MRIQC, fMRIPrep, xcpEngine, and QSIPrep quality control metrics and visual reports are created and examined for each subject run to identify data with high motion or statistical outliers in quality metrics. Code for the implementation of this processing pipeline is accessible at https://github.com/mrfil/pipeline-hpc/tree/SAY.

Cardiorespiratory Fitness.

Aerobic endurance capacity will be assessed by a supervised graded maximal exercise test. Oxygen uptake (VO2) will be measured from expired air samples taken at 30 second intervals until a peak VO2, the highest VO2, is attained at the point of test termination due to symptom limitation and/or volitional exhaustion. In order for a maximal effort to be verified, two of three criteria will need to be met including: 1) a plateau in VO2 between two or more workloads; 2) a respiratory exchange ratio 1.05; and a heart rate &gt; 95% of the age-predicted maximum (i.e. 220-age).

Blood Biomarkers.

Participants will arrive at the laboratory at 0700–0900 hrs. following an overnight fast and receive venipuncture using the butterfly needle technique. Blood samples will be collected in serum and EDTA collection tubes (~8 ml per tube), immediately centrifuged and subsequently both serum and plasma aliquots will be stored at −80°C. Plasma glucose concentrations will be measured on YSI 2900 biochemical analyzer (YSI Inc. Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, USA). Serum cortisol and plasma insulin concentrations will be measured by a commercially available immunoassay kit (Abcam and ALPCO Diagnostics, respectively). Plasma IL-6, C-reactive protein, and BDNF concentrations will be determined according to manufacturer’s instructions using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IL-6: R&amp;D systems, CRP: Alpco diagnostics, and BDNF: Abcam). Fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations will also be used to determine insulin resistance and whole-body insulin sensitivity indices via the homoeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), respectively. All measures have demonstrated (a) sensitivity to age-related change in cognition and brain function, (b) sensitivity to change as a function of lifestyle interventions and (c) sensitive and reliable indices of specific targeted aspects of cognition and brain function. Remaining blood will be banked for future ancillary studies and assays.

Physical Activity.

We plan to assess physical activity using a combination of objective and self-report measurements. We will use the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaires [49], a 4-item instrument specifically designed to assess the frequency of mild, moderate, and strenuous exercise done for more than 15 minutes during a specific week. At each timepoint, we will also assess physical activity by accelerometry (Actigraph; model GT3X+). Participants will be instructed to wear the small monitor on the non-dominant hip, fastened to a belt worn around the waist. The accelerometer will be worn during all waking hours for 7 days, except when bathing or swimming. Activity data will be collected in one-minute intervals (epochs), with the total number of counts for each day summed and divided by the number of days of monitoring to arrive at an average number of activity counts. Cut-points will be based on Freedson et al.[50] (i.e.,1952–5724 for moderate PA; ≥5725 for vigorous PA). Further processing of these data will take place using Actilife© software designed for the analysis of accelerometer data. In addition, we will document weekly frequency, duration, and intensity of activity as assessed by our activity logs – during the 6-month structured interventions.

2.4 Blinding and Randomization

Blinding will not be a concern at baseline as all baseline measurements will take place prior to randomization. Data collectors including the MRI technician, neuropsychological battery administrator, the supervising physician or clinical exercise physiologist at graded exercise testing and the phlebotomist will be blinded to group assignment and participants will be asked not to disclose their group assignment during month 6 and 12 testing appointments. Participants will be randomized into either a yoga, aerobic, or stretching-toning group after completion of all baseline assessments. Randomization will take place in cohorts and will be stratified by age, sex and baseline fitness levels.

2.5 Proposed Intervention Protocol

Group Exercise Sessions - Hybrid Format:

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, exercise sessions for all groups will be held in a hybrid format, with participants choosing one day/week in-person and two days/week virtually via Zoom. This will ensure smaller groups and adequate spacing in accordance with Covid-19 guidelines. Participants joining virtually will be required to have their cameras on throughout the session for safety and their screen will display the instructor and model teaching in-person. One research staff will be designated as the Zoom monitor for each session to ensure safety and provide technical support. All exercise leaders will be equipped with a microphone to ensure effective communication. Each group exercise leader will log weekly attendance for the 6-month intervention.

Yoga Group:

The yoga intervention is designed as an introductory, but progressive 6-month program based on the Hatha/Slow-flow Vinyasa styles of yoga. Both styles incorporate physical postures (asana), breathing (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana). Hatha yoga formed the foundation of all sequences to allow older adult participants to enter postures safely with an emphasis on form, muscle activation and joint alignment; elements of slow-flow Vinyasa (breath-linked movements) are integrated into later sequences to increase difficulty/intensity. Yoga sessions will be designed and led by certified yoga instructors. Class structure includes a 10-minute opening with breathing (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana), 40 minutes of postures (asana), and a 10-minute closing with restorative postures, breathing and meditation. A sample yoga sequence is presented in Table 4. All postures will be described and demonstrated by instructors and relevant modifications with chairs, blocks, straps and blankets will be provided. Chair modifications are offered for all postures throughout the program and are simultaneously modeled by a research assistant alongside the yoga instructor to encourage participants to listen to their bodies and promote an inclusive environment for choosing modifications. For participants attending in-person, instructors will offer hands-on adjustments as needed. Breathing practices and meditations are also progressive throughout the program beginning with introductory practices including breath awareness meditation (anapanasati) and 3-part breath (dirgha pranayama) and progressing to intermediate practices including extended exhale breathing (visama vritti), victorious breath (ujjayi) and alternate nostril breathing (nadi shodhana). All sessions end in final resting posture (savasana) in which instructors guided participants through closing meditations including body scans, focus on the self (vipassana), and salutation seal (anjali mudra). We have successfully used such a yoga protocol in our preliminary RCT [29,51] and it was well received and tolerated by the participants.

Aerobic Group:

Participants randomized into the aerobic group will begin by exercising for 20 minutes during the first week of the program and gradually increase their exercise duration to 40 minutes by the fourth week of the program. The structure of these aerobic sessions (see Table 5) is designed based on American College of Sports Medicine exercise prescription recommendations [52] and previous aerobics-based protocols used in several RCTs examining exercise effects on cognition and brain health [17,39,53]. Sessions are designed following a “circuit training” format, in which participants will be led through multiple circuits, each composed of timed bouts of exercise (“on”) periods followed by short recovery (“off”) periods. All exercises will have modified versions to accommodate all ability levels. Exercise “on” and “off” times will be slightly varied each week to diversify the circuits and keep participants engaged. The total exercise time will be matched with the other exercise groups at 3 hours/week. Levels of exercise intensity will be prescribed based on maximal responses during the initial graded exercise treadmill test. As the participants will be low active at baseline, the prescribed intensity will be 50–60% of the maximum heart rate reserve for weeks one to six and 60–75% for the remainder of the program. Participants in the aerobic exercise group will wear heart rate monitors and be encouraged to exercise within their target heart rate zone, which will be given to them at the beginning of each week. Participants will be encouraged throughout the session to continually monitor their heart rate (via their heart rate monitor), and perceived intensity (via the RPE scale), and adjust their work rate accordingly.

Stretching-Toning Control Group:

The active control condition proposed in this trial is similar to the control condition from our preliminary study and has been consistently used in the aerobic exercise literature. This control group will serve as an active control, accounting for the social environment, contact with research staff and overall research experience of the participants. This group will perform stretching and toning exercises using resistance bands. The exercise sessions are preceded by a standard warm-up and sessions will end with a study developed cool-down. The exercises are non-cardiorespiratory activities but progressive in nature and include modifications to accommodate injuries and physical conditions for participants. A new set of exercises are introduced every month and participants are encouraged to progress in intensity by using more weight or adding repetitions, mirroring progress in the two other intervention groups. They will be encouraged to engage in the activity at an intensity of 13–15 on the Borg’s rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE) [54].

Exercise and Home Logs:

All participants will receive a personal binder, which will include exercise and home logs for the 6-months of intervention where they will indicate type of attendance (in-person or Zoom), self-reported RPE using the Borg scale and enjoyment on a 5-point Likert scale. At the first exercise session, participants will also receive a Fitbit (FitBit Inc, San Francisco CA) to record their total exercise time, resting heart rate, average heart rate for each study session. Throughout the duration of 6-months, participants will also complete weekly home logs to record any physical activity accounting to 10 minutes or more outside the study sessions.

2.6 Adverse Events and Safety Monitoring

All adverse events and serious adverse events will be carefully monitored and reported to the University’s Institutional Review Board, National Institutes of Health and at bi-annual meetings with the Safety Officer assigned for the trial by the National Institutes of Health.

2.7 Power Analysis and Sample Size

Our sample size calculations are informed by the data from our preliminary studies and effect sizes from our meta-analysis [20]. Our power analyses are adjusted for the multiple group comparisons (alpha = .05/3 comparisons = .017). With the new alpha of .017, power at .80, 3 time-points, and a moderate effect size of f=.25, the desired total sample size is 138. Based on our past experience with retention rates for similar studies, we expect a 20% attrition. Thus, we will recruit 138 + 20% = 166 + 2 = 168 participants i.e. 56 per group.

2.8 Data Analysis Plan

Prior to hypothesis testing, all data will undergo a preliminary analytic procedure to determine missing data and out-of-range values, normality and internal consistency of subscales (Cronbach’s alphas), and degree of association between variables, i.e. multicollinearity. To test the effect of the intervention on outcomes (aims 1 and 2), we will conduct a group (3 interventions) x time (3 time-points) repeated measures general linear mixed model. Covariates of interest (e.g. age, gender and education) will also be adjusted in the models as necessary. In the presence of a significant overall difference, post-hoc multiple comparison tests will be performed to identify specific differences among interventions. For mediation analyses to determine whether the neurobiological and/or blood biomarker outcomes are potential mediators of the association between type of treatment and cognitive function, we will use an analytic approach based on the counterfactual framework [55]. This approach extends the traditional mediation formulae from Baron and Kenny [56] to allow for decomposition of a total effect into direct and indirect effects even when treatment-mediator is present [57].

3. Discussion

In this manuscript we describe the protocol for the first powered randomized control trial to test the efficacy of yoga vs. aerobic exercise with a stretching-strengthening control group on measures of neurocognition among middle aged and older adults. For the first time, we will be able to test for the effects of a structured 6-month yoga intervention on measures of executive function, brain structure, vasculature and neuronal connectivity and compare these findings directly with aerobic exercise. We will also explore the mediating role of physiological biomarkers including cardiorespiratory fitness, CRP, IL-6 and BDNF on improvements in behavioral and neuroimaging based cognitive outcomes.

In addition to advancing the science of yoga and contributing to the fields of cognitive aging, neuroscience and integrative medicine, the results of this proposed RCT could have a significant impact on health care recommendations for older adults. We believe that this RCT will test the efficacy of yoga against the well-established evidence for aerobic exercise. The corpus of literature on aerobic exercise demonstrates cognitive gains following 30–40 minute brisk walking protocols [19,58]. While higher intensities of aerobic exercise have well-documented health benefits [59] having an alternative lighter intensity activity provide similar cognitive gains could have far reaching implications. A scoping review of the literature suggests that light physical activity could also impact cognition [60] although the evidence is nascent and few studies have explored this relationship. Identifying alternate modes of physical activity that are equally effective is of particular importance for aging adults who are challenged by age-related chronic conditions and musculoskeletal conditions. We have previously demonstrated that yoga is as effective as stretching and toning exercises which utilize resistance bands and free weights, in improving functional fitness domains of balance, strength, flexibility and mobility among middle aged and older adults [10]. Yoga practice has also been shown to improve performance on behavioral measures of attention, processing speed and some domains of executive function [29,51] when compared to a stretching control group in a sample of middle aged and older adults. Based on the study results, yoga practice maybe recommended and promoted as an alternative form of physical activity for successful physical and cognitive aging, for aging adults. Our trial will also be among the first to examine mechanisms and moderators of the yoga-cognition relationship which are only partially tested in the literature [14].
