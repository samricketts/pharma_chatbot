This study tested the hypothesis that the association of APOE with paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) tangle pathology differs in brains with and without β-amyloid. Participants were 1,056 autopsied individuals from two clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Neuropathologic measures were obtained using immunohistochemistry targeting β-amyloid and PHFtau-tangles in 8 brain regions. Linear regression was used to compare the relation of APOE ε4 and ε2 to PHFtau-tangle density in persons with β-amyloid relative to persons without β-amyloid. We found an interaction between APOE ε4 carriers and presence of β-amyloid (β= −0.968, P=0.013) such that the associations of APOE ε4 with PHFtau-tangles was much stronger in brains with β-amyloid. Stratified analysis shows that the association of APOE ε4 with PHFtau tangles was considerably stronger among those with β-amyloid (β=0.757, P=1.1×10−15) compared to those without β-amyloid which was not significant (β= −0.201, P=0.424). Separately, APOE ε2 was associated with fewer tangles in brains with β-amyloid (β=−0.425, P=7.6×10−4) compared to those without β-amyloid which was not significant (β=−0.102, P=0.506). Thus, the presence of APOE ε4 and ε2 alleles was not associated with PHFtau tangles in the absence of β-amyloid. The data provide additional evidence that PHFtau-tangles in the absence of β-amyloid may reflect a pathologic process distinct from AD.


1. Introduction

The criteria for the neuropathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) recently published by the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association differs from previous consensus statements (Hyman, et al., 2012). A major change is the requirement of β-amyloid deposits for the neuropathologic diagnosis of AD, in addition to neocortical neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The requirement for β-amyloid deposits also differs from another model of pathologic AD which suggests that the appearance of NFT in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus is the earliest neuropathologic manifestation of AD regardless of the presence of β-amyloid (Braak and Braak, 1991,Braak and Braak, 1995). Recent papers referred to the condition of tangles in the absence of amyloid as “Primary age-related tauopathy” (PART) (Crary, et al., 2014,Jellinger, et al., 2015). Thus, the extent to which tangle pathology in the absence of β-amyloid represents AD or a separate process remains controversial.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphism is the most robust genetic risk factor for AD dementia (Corder, et al., 1993,Farrer, et al., 1997). Substantial evidence suggests that APOE affects clinical AD in large part through β-amyloid metabolism and triggers a cascade of events that ultimately results in NFT formation or propagation and cognitive impairment (Polvikoski, et al., 1995,Royall, et al., 2012,Schmechel, et al., 1993). The β-amyloid cascade hypothesis provides a biological background that can explain in part the relationship between APOE, β-amyloid, and NFT (Jack, et al., 2010). This raises the possibility that NFT in the absence of β-amyloid represents a pathologic process distinct from AD. In prior studies we found that β-amyloid mediated the association of APOE with paired helical filaments tau (PHFtau) and subsequent cognitive decline and clinical AD (Yu, et al., 2014). We also reported separate effects of age on mesial temporal lobe tangles consistent with a 2-process model of mesial temporal lobe tangles, the site of most tangles in the absence of β-amyloid (Mungas, et al., 2014). In this paper we extend our prior work by explicitly examining the association of APOE ε4 and ε2 with tangles in persons with and without β-amyloid. Finding robust associations of APOE with tangles in persons with β-amyloid but not in those without β-amyloid would provide additional evidence that tangles in the absence of β-amyloid represent a process distinct from AD.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants

Participants came from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), both are community-based, clinical-pathologic cohort studies investigating AD and other chronic conditions of aging. Participants signed consent for annual clinical evaluations and an Anatomic Gift Act agreeing to brain donation at the time of death. Both studies enroll individuals free of known dementia. They were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. ROS, started in 1994, enrolls older Catholic religious clergy across the United States. MAP, started in 1997, enrolls older residents from retirement facilities and senior and subsidized housing in the Chicago metropolitan area. The follow-up rate exceeds 90% and the autopsy rate exceeds 85%. More detailed information on study design and pathologic data collection of both ROS and MAP can be found in previous publications (Bennett, et al., 2012a,Bennett, et al., 2012b).

At time of this analysis, 1,385 of 3,043 participants enrolled had died. Of the deceased, 1,373 remained in the study and 1,198 (87.3%) were autopsied. Of these, the post-mortem assessment was complete for 1,092 persons and APOE genotype was available on 1,056 (96.7%). The average age at death was 88.2 years (standard deviation of 6.6 years, range 65.9 to108.3 years); and 677 (64.1%) were female. ROS and MAP cohorts are convenience samples and death is a form of informative censoring. We and others have reported that dementia is strongly associated with risk of death and thus the deceased group is enriched with persons with dementia and more neuropathologic burden. (Aguero-Torres, et al., 1999,James, et al., 2014,Rait, et al., 2010,Tschanz, et al., 2004). In order to investigate a possible bias resulting from an association between PART and mortality we explored the distribution of PART in a subset of persons enrolled early in the study and compared to the distribution of PART in the entire cohort. Among the 201 persons enrolled in the Religious Orders Study from 1994- to 1997 aged 80 and above at enrollment, 196 (98%) are deceased and 181 (90%) autopsied. Among this subset, the distribution of PART (13.2%) is similar to what is seen in the entire cohort (14.4%) suggesting that PART is not likely to be associated with selective mortality relative to other pathologies.

2.2 APOE Genotyping

DNA was extracted from white blood cells collected from participants or frozen brain tissue after death. APOE genotyping was performed by sequencing the codon 112 and codon 158 of exon 4 of the APOE gene (Boyle, et al., 2010). Individuals with at least one copy of the ε4 were considered as ε4 carriers. Individuals with at least one copy of the ε2 were considered as ε2 carriers. Thus, in these analyses, ε2/ε4 were used in both sets of models.

2.3 Neuropathology procedures

Brain removal and processing followed a standard protocol. One hemisphere was cut coronally into 1-cm slabs and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. β-amyloid deposits and PHF-tau tangles were assessed in 20µm sections. Immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis were used for β-amyloid (10D5, 1:600; Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA; 6F/3D, 1:50; DAKO North America Inc., Carpinteria, CA or 4G8, 1:9000 Covance Labs, Madison, WI) and stereology was used for PHFtau tangles (AT8, 1:2000; Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA) across eight different brain regions including the entorhinal cortex, the hippocampus at CA1, superior frontal cortex (Broadmann area [BA] 6/8), mid frontal cortex (BA 46/9), inferior temporal cortex (BA 20), angular gyrus cortex (BA 39/40), cingulate gyrus (BA 32/33) and calcarine cortex (BA 17). β-amyloid load and the density of PHFtau tangle density was obtained by averaging the mean percentage area per region, across all regions as previously reported (Bennett, et al., 2004). The absence of β-amyloid was characterized by a β-amyloid load of zero in all the eight immunostained sections. Neocortical type Lewy bodies (LB) were identifyied by alpha-synuclein positive LB (LB509, 1:100; Invitrogen/Zymed, Carlsbad, CA or pSyn, 1:20000; Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) in one or more neocortical regions (midfrontal, middle temporal and inferior parietal) (Schneider, et al., 2012). Neuritic plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were identified with modified Bielshowsky stain in 6µm sections in five different regions (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus at CA1, midfrontal cortex, middle temporal gyrus and inferior parietal cortex). CERAD criteria assessed NP burden and a Braak staging assessed the distribution and severity of NFT pathology. (Braak and Braak, 1991,Mirra, et al., 1991) The diagnosis of pathologic AD was based on the National Institute on Aging (NIA)–Reagan criteria.(1997). Macroscopic infarcts were recorded from fixed slabs and confirmed by histology. Microscopic infarcts were documented in at least 9 different sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin as previously reported (Schneider, et al., 2005). Severe neuronal cell loss and gliosis in the hippocampus on H&amp;E was identified as hippocampal sclerosis (Nag, et al., 2015).

2.4 Other variables

Age was calculated from birth data and date of death. Sex was self-reported. We used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score proximate to death (Bennett, et al., 2012a,Bennett, et al., 2012b,Folstein, et al., 1975).

2.5 Statistical analysis

First, we examined the frequencies of APOE ε4 and ε2 in three groups: those without β-amyloid and without pathologic diagnosis of AD based on NIA-Reagan criteria, presence of β-amyloid but without pathologic AD, and a group with β-amyloid deposits and with pathologic AD. Next, we examined differences in the association of APOE ε4 with PHFtau-tangle density in persons with and without β-amyloid. To do so, we fit a linear regression model with an interaction term between APOE ε4 and β-amyloid status, adjusted for age and sex. Because the variances of PHFtau tangle distribution differed between those with and without β-amyloid and this might influence the model estimation, we also conducted stratified analyses regressing APOE ε4 status on PHFtau tangles in persons with and without β-amyloid. Similar analyses were carried out for APOE ε2 genotype. Additional analyses controlled for common comorbid brain pathology including neocortical Lewy bodies, macro and microscopic infarcts and hippocampal sclerosis. In order to examine the possible confounding effect of the temporalspatial differences in β-amyloid and PHFtau tangle distributions on disease severity we repeated the analyses controlling for the MMSE. Searching for possible differences in the association of APOE and PHFtau tangles in participants with low β-amyloid burden, we also conducted stratified analyses regressing APOE ε4 status on PHFtau tangles for each of three groups: without β-amyloid and without pathologic AD, presence of β-amyloid but without pathologic AD, and presence of β-amyloid and pathologic AD, adjusted for age and sex. We conducted the same analyses for APOE ε2 genotype. In order to investigate whether our results differ by brain regions, we repeated the analysis by examining mesial temporal and neocortical PHFtau-tangle pathologies separately.

The measures of PHFtau-tangle density were right skewed; we therefore applied square root transformation prior to the analyses. A nominal threshold of p &lt; 0.05 was used to determine significance. Analyses were performed using SAS/STAT software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA).

3. Results

Demographic and neuropathologic characteristics of participants by β-amyloid and APOE ε4 status are shown in Table 1. APOE ε4 was present in 29.5% of persons with β-amyloid and only 7.2% of persons without β-amyloid (Chi-square=33.4, degrees of freedom=1, P=7.7×10−9). The density of both neocortical and mesial temporal tangles was considerably higher in those with β-amyloid, when compared to those without β-amyloid (Ps&lt;0.001 for both neocortical tangles and mesial temporal tangles). Table 2 shows the characteristics of participants by β-amyloid and APOE ε2 status. APOE ε2 was present in 25.7% of persons without β-amyloid and only 13.7% of persons with β-amyloid (Chi-square=14.2, degrees of freedom=1, P=0.0002).

The association of APOE ε4 with PHFtau tangle density was first examined in a linear regression model with an interaction term between APOE ε4 status and the presence of β-amyloid, adjusting for age and sex (Table 3). In this model, the term for APOE ε4 refers to the association of the ε4 allele with tangle density in persons with β-amyloid; and the interaction term compares the ε4 association among persons without β-amyloid relative to the reference group of persons with β-amyloid. The estimate was negative and the interaction was significant (P=0.013), suggesting that the association of the ε4 genotype with tangle density was lower among persons without β-amyloid. We next performed separate regression analysis for persons with (N=904) and without β-amyloid (N=152). In persons with β-amyloid, APOE ε4 was strongly associated with a higher burden of PHFtau tangles (β=0.757, P=1.1×10−15). By contrast, we did not find an association among persons without β-amyloid (β=−0.201, P=0.424). Assuming the effect size of APOE ε4 were similar to the group with β-amyloid, our current sample size in the group without β-amyloid (N=152) would be sufficient to detect such an effect with 80% power at alpha level of 0.05. The differences in burdens of tangle pathology by APOE and β-amyloid status are illustrated in Figure 1. We repeated the analyses controlling for macro and microscopic infarctions, cortical Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis and the findings were essentially unchanged (data not shown). Additional stratified analyses controlled for MMSE proximate to death. The findings were essentially the same. APOE ε4 remained strongly associated with a higher burden of PHFtau tangles in persons with β-amyloid (β=0.455, P=7.6×10−8), but not among persons without β-amyloid (β=−0.198, P=0.431). Similarly, APOE ε2 was still associated with fewer PHFtau tangles in persons with β-amyloid (β=−0.300, P=6.2×10−3) but not in persons without β-amyloid (β=−0.105, P=0.495).

The associations of APOE ε4 with both mesial temporal tangle density and neocortical tangle density were, in general, consistent with the finding for tangle density averaged across brain regions. The ε4 by β-amyloid interaction was attenuated and not significant for mesial temporal tangles (P=0.134) and marginally significant for neocortical tangles (P=0.050). However, the results from stratified analyses (Tables S1 and S2) show that the association of APOE ε4 with mesial temporal tangle pathology was highly significant in persons with β-amyloid (β=0.874, P=2.7×10−11) but not significant in those without β-amyloid (β=−0.026, P=0.963). Similarly, the neocortical tangle density was highly significant among ε4 carriers in persons with β-amyloid (β=0.771, P=2.7×10−15), and not significant in persons without β-amyloid (β=0.009, P=0.926). Next, we examined the association of APOE ε2 with tangle pathology by β-amyloid status. Our first model included an interaction term between APOE ε2 and β-amyloid status (Table 4). In this model, the term for APOE ε2 refers to the association of the ε2 allele with tangle density in persons with β-amyloid; and the interaction term compares the ε2 association among persons without β-amyloid relative to the reference group of persons with β-amyloid. The ε2 by β-amyloid interaction was not significant (P=0.264). However, the results from stratified models suggest that the magnitude of the ε2 association is likely to differ among persons with and without β-amyloid. In these models, APOE ε2 was associated with fewer PHFtau tangles in persons with β-amyloid (β=−0.425, P=7.6×10−4). By contrast, we did not find an association in persons without β-amyloid (β=−0.102, P=0.506). Power calculation suggests that it would require a sample size ~4,400 to detect ε2 by β-amyloid interaction at a nominal α level of 0.05. Further adjustment for macro and microscopic infarctions, cortical Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis did not change the results (data not shown).

Similar results were found in separate analyses of ε2 on mesial temporal tangles and neocortical tangles. Briefly, we did not find significant ε2 by β-amyloid interactions on either tangle pathology. However, stratified regression models show that in persons with β-amyloid, the ε2 carriers had lower mesial temporal (β=−0.479, P=0.005) and neocortical tangle densities (β=−0.551, P=2.3×10−5). By contrast, both associations were greatly attenuated and were not significant in persons without β-amyloid (Tables S1 and S2).

Finally, we conducted stratified analyses regressing APOE ε4 status on PHFtau tangles in three groups: without β-amyloid and without pathologic AD (N=152), presence of β-amyloid but without pathologic AD (N=245), and presence of β-amyloid and pathologic AD (N=659) (Table 5). We observe that APOE ε4 was strongly associated with a higher burden of PHFtau tangles in the group with pathologic AD (β=0.592, P=5.8×10−8). The association was significant but much weaker in the group with β-amyloid but without pathologic AD (β=0.266, P=0.032). Finally, as before, we did not find the association among persons without β-amyloid (β=−0.201, P=0.424). We repeated the analysis for APOE ε2 allele (Table 5), and observe significant association of APOE ε2 and PHFtau tangles only in the group with pathologic AD (β=−0.536, P=5.9×10−4). Note the point estimate for the group with β-amyloid but without pathologic AD is about 70% of that for APOE ε4; thus the lack of association could be the result of a reduction of power among those with this allele.

4. Discussion

In this study, we identified marked differences in the association between APOE and PHFtau tangles among persons with and without β-amyloid deposits. Specifically, we found that APOE ε4 is strongly associated with a higher density of PHFtau tangles and APOE ε2 is associated with fewer PHFtau tangles in brains with β-amyloid but not in brains without β-amyloid. The association of APOE ε4 and PHFtau tangles was also observed in the participants with low β-amyloid burden insufficient for a pathologic diagnosis of AD but not in the absence of β-amyloid suggesting that the association of APOE with PHFtau tangles depends upon β-amyloid presence. Results were similar when examining mesial temporal and neocortical tangle separately. Further, they were unchanged after controlling for cognitive performance and other common neuropathologies. We are unaware of prior studies examining whether the association of APOE and PHFtau tangles differs by β-amyloid deposition.

Many previous studies reported associations between APOE and β-amyloid deposition and NFT (Nagy, et al., 1995,Ohm, et al., 1995). Post-mortem studies showed that β-amyloid levels in the brain, the load of β-amyloid and NFT´s vary according to APOE genotype (ε4 &gt; ε3 &gt; ε2) (Bennett, et al., 2009,Nicoll, et al., 2011,Sabbagh, et al., 2013). These studies reveal a concurrent and symmetric association of APOE with both β-amyloid and NFT, suggesting that the association of APOE with NFT could be mediated by β-amyloid. Only one neuropathologic study found an association between APOE ε2 carriers and increased β-amyloid pathology. However, this study was performed in a population much older than the sample included in this and other studies suggesting that the relation between APOE and neuropathology may vary according to age (Berlau, et al., 2009).

Robust experimental studies in transgenic mice link APOE ε4 and ε2 to distinct mechanisms of β-amyloid processing and metabolism. APOE-E4-lipoproteins reportedly have lower binding affinity to β-amyloid and as result may be less efficient in mediating β-amyloid clearance (Castellano, et al., 2011,LaDu, et al., 1994). APOE E4 isoform may also be less efficient in mediating degradation of β-amyloid (Jiang, et al., 2008). APOE ε2 has been shown to be most effective in clearing β-amyloid from the brain and bloodstream and avoiding β-amyloid deposition by preventing the conversion of sustained forms of β-amyloid into pathologic oligomers (Fagan, et al., 2002,Ma, et al., 1994,Sharman, et al., 2010). By contrast, the direct effect of both APOE ε4 and ε2 to PHFtau pathology is less clear with few experimental studies showing that APOE-4 isoforms may induce fibrillary tangle-like intracellular inclusions in neurons containing phosphorylated tau (Brecht, et al., 2004,Huang, 2010).

The results of this study support the hypothesis of a 2-process model underlying PHFtau tangles in mesial temporal lobes (Crary, et al., 2014,Jellinger, et al., 2015,Mungas, et al., 2014,Nelson, et al., 2009,Royall and Palmer, 2014). The first one is the AD process characterized by the presence of β-amyloid deposits and recognized by the most recent guidelines for diagnosis of neuropathologic AD. Previous studies advocate that β-amyloid deposits are the initial AD event that triggers a cascade of events that will result in PHFtau tangles formation (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002,Jack, et al., 2011). In our study, the density of PHFtau tangles was much higher in brains with β-amyloid and in the group with β-amyloid APOE was very strongly associated with PHFtau tangles. Even in the subjects with low β-amyloid burden it was possible to find an association between APOE ε4 and PHFtau tangles demonstrating that the presence of a low β-amyloid load is sufficient to find an association of APOE with PHFtau tangles. These are all evidence in favor of the β-amyloid cascade hypothesis. The second process is the presence of PHFtau tangles, especially in mesial temporal lobes in the absence of β-amyloid. In previous studies PHFtau tangles alone had been associated with age and cognitive impairment (Jellinger and Attems, 2007,Nelson, et al., 2009,Yamada, 2003). Further, PHFtau tangles can characterize a number of conditions other than AD including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and tau mutations (Klein, et al., 2004,Nelson, et al., 2009,Yoshiyama, et al., 2005). In our study, this second process is characterized by a lower density of PHFtau tangles in mesial temporal lobes, concentrates APOE ε2 carriers and in these subjects APOE is not associated with PHFtau tangles when compared to the first process.

An alternative hypothesis conflicting with the β-amyloid cascade hypothesis is that AD begins with PHFtau in mesial temporal lobe and spreads through the brain following a uniform and progressive pattern (Braak and Del Tredici, 2011). Recent animal models with transgenic mice suggest that tau pathology may be transmitted from neuron to neuron through a trans-synaptic mechanism from mesial temporal lobe to neocortical regions (Liu, et al., 2012). What might be considered a hybrid hypothesis is one in which AD begins with mesial temporal lobe tangles and the spread of tangles through the brain is augmented by β-amyloid (Jack, 2014). Further, experimental studies suggest that intraneuronal β-amyloid oligomers are associated to synaptic dysfunction, a process that may contribute to trans-synaptic tau spread and is enhanced in APOE ε4 carriers (Koffie, et al., 2012,Sen, et al., 2012). Thus, the presence of β-amyloid could augment the spreading of PHFtau tangles. Our findings of a greater density of PHFtau tangles in persons with β-amyloid are also consistent with this model of AD.

This study has limitations. As few APOE ε4 carriers are without β-amyloid, a much larger sample might have identified an association between APOE and PHFtau tangles in persons without β-amyloid. However, if there is any association between APOE and PHFtau tangles in persons without β-amyloid it remains much weaker than the association found in those with β-amyloid. Power calculations suggested that the sample size included in the group without β-amyloid would be sufficient to detect an association of APOE ε4 and PHFtau tangles if the effect size were similar to the group with β-amyloid. Second, we did not determine specific associations of APOE to the different specific species of β-amyloid such as 42 or 40. Likewise, different tau antibodies identify slightly different subpopulations of tangles. Third, the convenience sample used in this study may limit the generalizability of our findings. Finally, the participants were much older than many other studies and it’s possible that the associations vary by age.

The study also had a number of strengths. The major strengths are the large sample size from two prospective community-based studies of older persons. Both enjoyed very high clinical follow-up and autopsy rates. Further, they employed identical uniform quantitative post-mortem procedures by examiners blinded to APOE status.

Highlights

We tested the association of APOE with tau-tangles in brains with and without β-amyloid

APOE ε4 was strongly associated with PHFtau-tangles in brains with β-amyloid

APOE ε2 was associated with fewer tangles in brains with β-amyloid

APOE ε4 and ε2 were not associated with tau-tangles in the absence of β-amyloid

Data suggests that PHFtau-tangles and no β-amyloid is a distinct pathologic process
