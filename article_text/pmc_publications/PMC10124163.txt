pmcIntroduction

Human herpesviruses (HHVs) have been proposed to play a role in neurodegeneration for decades[1–3], although their contributions to disease onset and progression are not fully understood. Of particular interest for the CNS are Human Herpesvirus 6A and B (HHV6A, HHV6B), which can infect a wide range of cells. While HHV6A and B share high sequence homology they have recently been characterized to represent different viruses based on a number of criteria including cell tropism and known disease association [4]. We focus in our work on HHV6A, which is highly neurotropic [5–7]. Primary infection with HHV6A typically occurs during childhood [8–10] when the virus preferentially targets T cells [11]. These primary infections are often followed by lifelong viral latency, a quasi-quiescent state that allows HHV6A to persist in the host, mainly in the brain [12–14], throughout life while maintaining the ability for reactivation [15, 16]. The route of entry into the brain is not clear, but HHV6A late gene products in the absence of virion production can readily be detected within cells in the CNS including neurons and oligodendrocytes [17–22]. HHV6A infection of both primary human and murine OPCs and neurons in vitro also quickly leads to viral latency[23–28] with no propagation or release of infectious virions[25, 29]. Post-mortem studies have identified late gene expression in oligodendrocytes and neurons [17, 30], but no productive infection. A unique feature of the latency state of HHV6 virus is its ability to integrate the viral DNA into the host genome[12–14, 31–35]. This can also occur in germinal cells causing HHV6A to be passed on to offspring [14, 36–41]. In fact, approximately 1% of the human population carry inherited chromosomally integrated HHV6A (iciHHV-6A)[42, 43].

Latency is associated with the continuous expression of the unique viral gene U94A [44, 45], that has no homolog in other herpesviruses [27, 28]. U94A is consistently detected by RT-PCR in the absence of other transcripts in HHV6A-infected cells[46] and a study on iciHHV6A individuals has shown the presence of U94A transcripts, indicative of latent infection, in 55% of these individuals [47]. A study on MS patients showed that despite a low prevalence of HHV6 DNA in peripheral blood, MS patients have increased prevalence and titer of immunolglobulins that recognize U94 protein, indicative of latent HHV6A infections. While expression of U94A is believed to play an integral role in maintaining viral latency [44, 48, 49] by suppressing viral replication [50] and avoiding immune detection, the impact of U94A expression on normal host cells is poorly understood. Expression of U94A has been shown to reduce migration of endothelial cells in vitro [51] and our work showed that expression of U94A inhibits migration in human glial progenitor cells in vitro and after transplantation in vivo [52]. Based on these observations we hypothesized that U94A might impact cytoskeletal functions in a variety of host cells where cell migration is tightly linked to cellular maturation, plasticity and function.

Materials and Methods

Human oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (hOPC) isolation

hOPCs were isolated and maintained as previously described [121]. Briefly, cortical tissue from 18–22 week-old fetal brain was dissected and the minced tissue was digested at 37°C with 59 U/mL papain (Worthington # LS003127) in Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco #114170–161) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes (EMD), pH 8.0 and 125 U/mL Dnase I (Sigma # D4263), then triturated in 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA)/HBSS with 250 U/mL Dnase I. CD140a+ human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs) were isolated by immune-purification using anti-CD140a-bound magnetic beads (Miltenyi). Cells were plated on tissue culture plastic coated with poly-L-lysine (1 μg/cm2; Sigma #P1274) at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 in complete DMEM:F12/Sato Growth Medium: DMEM:F12 (Gibco #11330–057) supplemented with 10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma #I5500), 100 μg/mL holotransferrin (Sigma #T2252), 0.03% (w/v) BSA Fraction V (Sigma #A7979–50ML), 10 μM putrescine (Sigma #P7505), 200 nM progesterone [Sigma #P0130], 235 nM sodium selenite [Sigma #S1382]), and 50 μg/mL gentamycin (Gibco #15750–060), 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA (R&amp;D #221-AA), and 10 ng/mL basic FGF (Miltenyi #130–093). Cells were maintained at 37 °C (5% O2/7% CO2) and passaged at a density of 13,000 cells/cm2. Cells were passaged using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco #2300), neutralized with 80 KU/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma #T9003), and replated in DMEM:F12/Sato Growth Medium. Cells were maintained in this medium for the remainder of their time in culture, unless exposed to differentiation conditions.

Human cortical neuron (hCXN) isolation and culture

hCXNs were obtained as the CD140-negative cell population from primary human fetal samples dissected for hOPC isolation. hCXNs were plated on tissue culture plates coated with 1μg/mL each poly-L-lysine and laminin (Gibco #23017–015) in Neurobasal medium (Gibco #21103049) with GlutaMAX (Gibco #35050061) and B-27 supplement (Gibco # 17504044). hCXNs were maintained at 37 °C (5% O2/7% CO2) until the initiation of experiments, with a 50% media change every third day.

Lentiviral expression vector production and delivery

HHV6A cDNA was ligated into GFP co-expressing lentiviral vectors (System Biosciences #CD516B-1). GFP only expressing lentiviral vector (System Biosciences #CD513B-1) was used as a control. For viral production, HEK 293TN cells were propagated in DMEM (Gibco #11965–02) with 10% FetalClone II (Cytiva Hyclone SH3006603). Following lipofection (TransIT-LT1, Mirus) with Pax2 and VSV-G lentiviral packaging plasmids, 293TN cells were maintained in DMEM/1% FetalClone II for 72 hours before harvesting virus containing supernatant. Infections of hOPCs and hCXNs were performed by adding lentiviral supernatant to cell cultures at a dilution of 1:4 in culture medium. Cells were incubated at 37°C (hOPCs at 5% O2/7% CO2, hCXNs at 20% O2/7% CO2) for 4 hours before virus containing medium was replaced by growth medium.

SILAC proteomics:

hOPCs infected with control or U94A lentivirus were cultured for 28 days in SILAC medium, after which cells were passaged, counted, mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and submitted for mass spectrometry analysis by the University of Rochester Mass Spectrometry Resource Lab. Cells were lysed in 50 μL of lysis buffer (8M urea, 75 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5) per million cells, followed by vortexing and sonication using a QSonica sonicator. Sonication cycles consisted of five 10 second sonications with 1 minute incubations on ice between each cycle. Samples were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 16,000 x g, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined by BCA (Thermo Scientific). 20 ug of each sample was removed and placed in lo-bind tubes. Reduction of protein disulfide bonds was performed with 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature, and protein alkylation was performed with 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min in darkness. DTT was added to 1 mM to quench the IAA before adding 50 mM HEPES to dilute the urea concentration to 1M. 10 uL of 50 ng/uL trypsin was added to each sample and digested overnight at 37° C. The digest was quenched by addition of 1% (v/v) formic acid. Peptides were then desalted using C18 spin tips, and the eluted peptides were dried down in a Speed Vac (Labconco). Dried peptides were re-suspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and placed in autosampler vials.

Peptides were injected onto 30 cm C18 column with 1.8 um beads (Sepax), with an Easy nLC-1000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher), connected to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, while solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Ions were introduced to the mass spectrometer using a Nanospray Flex source operating at 2 kV. The gradient began at 3% B and held for 2 minutes, increased to 8% B over 10 minutes, increased to 30% B over 142 minutes and then went to 50% B in 7 minutes before a ramp up to 70% B in 2 minutes, where it was held for 5 minutes, prior to returning to 3% B in 4 minutes. The column was then allowed to re-equilibrate for 8 minutes for a total run time of 180 minutes per sample. The Q Exactive Plus was operated in data-dependent mode, with a full MS1 scan followed by 20 data-dependent MS2 scans. The full scan was done over a range of 400–1400 m/z, with a resolution of 70,000 at m/z of 200, an AGC target of 1e6, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Ions with a charge state between 2–5 were picked for fragmentation. The MS2 scans were performed at 17,500 resolution, with an AGC target of 5e4 and a maximum injection time of 55 ms. The isolation width was 1.5 m/z, with an offset of 0.3 m/z, and a normalized collision energy of 27. After fragmentation, ions were put on an exclusion list for 25 seconds to allow the mass spectrometer to fragment lower abundant peptides.

Raw data was searched using the Mascot search engine within the Proteome Discoverer software platform, version 1.4 (Thermo Fisher), using the SwissProt human database. Trypsin was selected as the enzyme allowing up to 2 missed cleavages, with an MS1 mass tolerance of 10 ppm, and an MS2 mass tolerance of 25 mmu. Carbamidomethyl was set as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine was set as a variable modification. The precursor ion area detector node was used to determine relative abundances between the SILAC light and heavy peptides. Heavy/Light protein ratios were calculated by taking the median peptide ratio for a given protein. Percolator was used as the FDR calculator, filtering out peptides which had a q-value greater than 0.01.

Live cell imaging

Images were obtained by using Andor Fusion acquisition software (Oxford Instruments) on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope with an Andor Dragonfly spinning disc confocal system (Oxford Instruments) and a 488 nm OBIS LX solid state laser. Images were obtained with an Andor Zyla 4.2 camera (Oxford Instruments) through a 20x pan fluor objective (Nikon). For live cell imaging, cells were mounted in a perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments) and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 85% humidity in a Stage Top Incubator (Okolab). Immediately prior to imaging, cells were exposed to 10 μM Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (EMB Millipore #688000). In each 2-hour imaging session, 5 fields of view were imaged every 10 minutes. Videos were analyzed for GFP+ cell area over time using Imaris analysis software (Oxford Instruments).

Immunocytochemistry

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma #T9284) before probing overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used to immune-label targets: PDGFRα (1:200; Santa Cruz #sc-338), NG2 (1:200; Santa Cruz #sc-20162), Nkx2.2 (1:200; Santa Cruz #15015), A2B5 (1:4; in-house hybridoma supernatant), PSA-NCAM (1:200; Millipore MAB5324), CNP (1:1000; Millipore #MAB326), GFAP (1:1000; Agilent Technologies #Z033429–2) GalC (1:4; in-house hybridoma supernatant), β tubulin (1:500; Abcam #ab15568,), Olig2 (1:500; Millipore #MABN50), DCX (1:250; Abcam #ab135349), NeuN (1:500; Millipore #MAB377), Brn2 (1:400; Santa Cruz #sc-393324), Satb2 (1:4; Abcam #ab51502), Tbr1 (1:300; Abcam #ab31940), CTIP2 (1:200; Abcam #ab28448), βIII tubulin (1:500; Millipore #MAB1637), synaptophysin (1:100; Abcam #ab8049), PSD-95 (1:200; Thermo Fisher #51–6900), MAP2 (1:300; Thermo Fisher #13–1500). Antibody binding was detected with appropriate Alexa Fluor-coupled antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (Thermo Fisher Scientific), applied for 2 hours at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in HBSS plus 5% fetal calf serum with 0.5% sodium azide and 0.1% Triton X-100. Stained cells on coverslips were rinsed 3 times in 1x PBS, counter-stained with 1 μg/mL 4′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific #D1306) and mounted on glass slides with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech #0100–01). Multi-channel fluorescence images were acquired by LAS AF software using a Leica TCS SP5 laser confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) with either a 40x or 63x oil immersion lens.

Immunoblotting: Fluorescence

10 μg of each protein sample was electrophoretically separated using 4–12% gradient Novex PAGE gels as per manufacturer’s instructions (XCell SureLock Mini-Cell Electrophoresis System, Invitrogen). Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad #1620145) using a Mini Trans-Blot transfer system (Bio-Rad), as per manufacturer’s instructions. After transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rocking in 1x TBS-T with 5% BSA Fraction V before overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies against Gelsolin (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology #12953), WASF1 (1:200, Millipore, MABN503), synaptophysin (1:500; Abcam #ab8049) or post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95; 1:250 Thermo Fisher Scientific #51–6900) diluted in TRIS-buffered saline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (TBS-T) with 5% (w/v) BSA Fraction V. Blots were then washed in 1x TBS-T and incubated with species-specific fluorescent secondary antibodies (StarBright blue 700 goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad #12004161), StarBright blue 520 goat-anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad #12005866), hFAB rhodamine anti-actin (Bio-Rad #12004163)) diluted 1:3000 in 1x TBS-T with 5% BSA Fraction V for 1 hour at room temperature. Nitrocellulose membranes were imaged using Image Lab Touch Software on a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Band optical density was quantified using ImageJ and proteins of interest were normalized to β-actin signal levels.

Neuronal morphological maturation analysis

Purified human cortical neurons were plated at 20,000 cells/cm2 on plates coated with 1μg/mL each poly-L-lysine and laminin in Neurobasal medium with GlutaMAX and B-27 supplement. At 5 days in culture, cells were infected with U94A/GFP or GFP control virus. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 7 days post-infection and were immunostained against βIII tubulin (1:500, Millipore #MAB1637) to mark neuronal processes. Neurite morphology was analyzed using the FilamentTracer application in Imaris analysis software (Oxford Instruments).

Cell survival analysis

Purified human cortical neurons were plated at 20,000 cells/cm2 on plates coated with 1 μg/mL each poly-L-lysine and laminin in Neurobasal medium with GlutaMAX and B-27 supplement. At 5 days in culture, cells were infected with U94A/GFP and GFP control virus. At 7 days post-infection, cells were incubated with 2 μg/mL Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride, trihydrate (Invitrogen, #H21492) and 1 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) for 30 minutes at 37°C to determine the proportion of total and dead cells, respectively. Single cell analysis was performed using a Celigo cytometer (Nexcelom) and the percent live values are reported (=100 x (1 – (PI+ Dead cells/ Hoechst+ Total cells) ).

Synaptic analysis

Purified hCXNs were plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 on plates coated with 1 μg/mL each poly-L-lysine and laminin in Neurobasal medium with GlutaMAX and B-27 supplement. At 21 days in culture, cells were infected with U94A/GFP and GFP control vectors following the same procedure described for human OPCs. At 7 days post-infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunostained against synaptophysin and PSD-95 to mark pre- and postsynaptic structures, respectively. Synaptic puncta were identified as sites of colocalization of synaptophysin and PSD-95 using Imaris analysis software (Oxford Instruments). Prism (v8.0; GraphPad) was used for data analysis and presentation.

Statistical analysis

Bar graphs are plotted as mean +/− SEM or +/− SD and represent, at a minimum, 3 independent biological replicates performed in triplicate. Two-group comparisons were analyzed using two-tailed Student’s t-test, and multiple variable comparisons were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test.

Results

Long-term U94A expression in hOPCs alters expression of WASF1 and Gelsolin

To gain a more detailed understanding of the factors involved in the migration defect we observed in hOPCs [52] we used stable isotope labeling of amino acids in culture (SILAC)[53], which allows direct comparison of quantities of a given protein in two samples in a single mass spectrometry analysis and provides an unbiased approach to identify protein changes over time. Because the SILAC protocol requires an estimated five cell divisions to occur for full incorporation of isotope-labeled amino acids, we maintained cells in culture for 28 days following infection before combining cell populations for mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, our findings from this experiment represent the protein changes that result from a more prolonged U94A expression.

We identified 129 downregulated proteins and 45 upregulated proteins that met a threshold of at least a 20% change in expression. We used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to perform a downstream effects analysis, which identifies cellular functions and disease mechanisms predicted to be affected based on observed protein expression changes. This analysis identified 147 functional annotations that were predicted to be impacted in U94A positive cells (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher’s Exact Test, thresholded for at least five affected molecules per annotation). Of these, 20 annotations fell into categories related to cellular morphology, cellular assembly and organization, and cellular movement (Table 1). Interestingly, we found a trend towards inactivation (negative z-score) of a majority of these pathways, including formation of cellular protrusions, organization of cytoskeleton, cell movement, and migration of cells. Within these migration and morphology-related categories, we verified two downregulated proteins, Gelsolin and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 1 (WAVE1, also referred to as WASF1), which have actin-modifying properties and are implicated to play a role in myelin membrane wrapping[54, 55].

For validation we used an independent set of primary hOPC samples, which were cultured for 14 or 28 days post-U94A transfection. We were able to confirm significant downregulation in U94A-expressing cells (Gelsolin p=0.047, WASF1 p= 0.015, paired two-tailed t-test) at 28 days (Figure 1).

U94A expression affects hOPC process dynamics

As decreased expression of WASF1 has been shown to be critical for stabilization of protrusions in hOPCs [56], we analyzed protrusion/process formation and cell motility in real time in U94A-expressing hOPCs. For these experiments we exposed hOPCs for 4 hours to the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (trans-4-[(1 R)-1-aminoethyl]-N-4-pyridinylcyclohexanecarbox amide dihydrochloride;[57], to stimulate branching without inducing proliferation in hOPC cultures[58]. As a proxy measurement for the formation of cellular protrusions, we measured the total area per cell using the clearly detectable GFP signal in control and U94A co-expressing cells over time [59]. Live cell imaging at 10 minute intervals over 2 hours revealed that exposure to Y-27632 in hOPC control cells was associated with a steady increase in protrusions during the two-hour imaging session (effect of time post Y-27632 exposure on cell area p &lt; 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Figure 2). In contrast, the cell area of U94A expressing hOPCs was declined over the 2 hour time frame. A simple linear regression model shows a highly significant difference between the slopes (p =0.0005) and a significant interaction of time and genotype (p&lt;0.001) (Figure 2B). The steady decline in protrusion in U94A cells was particular apparent after 60 minutes. The change in area was not due to a difference in overall cell number as both cultures contain similar numbers of cells at the beginning and end of the time lapse imaging (Figure 2C).

U94A expression impairs morphological maturation of hOPCs

Actin microfilaments play a critical role in providing a branched network that can be populated by microtubules [60]. Gelsolin has been suggested to influence the shift of unstable microtubules that define the OPC stage to the more stable phenotype of the differentiated oligodendrocyte [61]. Based on the impaired actin dynamics and downregulation of gelsolin we observed in hOPCs, we hypothesized that microtubule branching might also be impaired by U94A expression. To test whether U94A expression alters branching morphology we used anti-β-tubulin labeling, which has been shown to label the branched microtubule network of human oligodendroglia [62]. Cells were isolated as described before [52] and exposed to thyroid hormone (T3/T4) to induce differentiation into pre-myelinating human oligodendrocytes (hOLs). 10 days after induction, cultures were immunostained for β-tubulin and Imaris FilamentTracer analysis was used to reconstruct tubulin processes and measure their morphological features (Figure 3A,B). Although U94A expression did not influence the length (p=0.679, paired t-test) or area (p=0.858, paired t-test) of tubulin processes, U94A-expressing cells exhibited significantly fewer branch points than control cells (p=0.036, paired t-test) (Figure 3C–E).

The tubulin cytoskeleton also plays a critical role in the transport of myelin components, such as myelin basic protein (MBP), for localized translation in distal oligodendrocyte processes [63]. Impairments in MBP mRNA trafficking have been shown to lead to inefficient translation [64]. To test whether the tubulin defects impacted MBP protein expression, we conducted Western blot analysis on lysates from differentiated U94A and control T3/T4-differentiated human oligodendrocytes. We saw significantly less expression of MBP (p=0.017, paired t-test) when compared to control cultures (Figure 4A). In contrast, there was no difference between groups (p = 0.935, paired t-test) in PLP1 expression, a marker for immature oligodendrocytes (Figure 4B).

U94A expression inhibits morphological complexity in immature hCXN cultures

Neurons are also potential targets for U94A expression in the context of a latent HHV-6A infection. As the coordination of actin and microtubule networks are a critical part of neurogenesis and neuronal maturation[65], we tested the impact of U94A expression on human neurons. These cells represent a predominantly neuronal population with a majority of cells expressing doublecortin, a microtubule-associated protein expressed by immature, migratory neuron progenitors (Figure 5)[66]. A very small percentage of these cells express NeuN (marking neuronal nuclei) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2; marking dendrites), markers for differentiated neurons (Figure 5C–D, I). 9% of cells in these cultures are contaminating GFAP positive astrocytes. We also characterized neurons by their expression of cortical layer-specific markers, identifying specific subtypes of cells from a variety of laminae. About half of cells expressed Brain-2 (Brn2) and Special AT-Rich Sequence-Binding Protein 2 (Satb2), markers of neurons in cortical layers 2–4[67, 68] (Figure 5E,F,J). Layer six corticothalamic projection neurons (positive for T-brain-1(Tbr1);[69]) and layer five subcortical projection neurons (positive for B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 11(Bcl11b)/CTIP2; [70]) make up 17% and 13% of the neuronal population, respectively (Figure 5G,H,J).

We infected these immature human cortical neurons (hCXN) after five days of in vitro growth with lentiviral vectors expressing either U94A and GFP or GFP alone and examined effects at seven days post infection (Figure 6A). Cultures were exposed to Hoechst dye and propidium iodide to mark total and dead cells, respectively. We did not identify a significant difference in cell viability between U94A expressing cells and controls (p=0.263, paired t-test) (Figure 6B). When we examined the effects of U94A on the differentiation of hCXN cultures we saw very few cells expressing the mature neuronal marker NeuN, and observed no significant difference in the proportion of NeuN positive cells between U94A and control groups (p=0.994, paired t-test) (Figure 6C). As these cultures also contain a small proportion of astrocytes, we immunostained against GFAP to observe whether U94A expression affected astrogliosis. Similar to what we observed in hOPCs previously [52], no differences in the proportion of GFAP positive astrocytes were seen between groups (Figure 6D).

We next examined the morphological complexity of the immature neuronal population. Seven days post-infection, cells were fixed and immunostained for the neuron-specific cytoskeletal marker βIII tubulin to visualize processes, and images were reconstructed and analyzed using Imaris FilamentTracer (Figure 7A, B). No significant difference was seen in neurite length (p=0.44, paired t-test) or area (p=0.248, paired t-test) between groups (Figure 7C, D). Using the Sholl method [71], we compared neurite complexity between the U94A and control samples. Reminiscent of the result we saw in immature oligodendrocytes, there was a significant negative effect of U94A expression on neurite complexity (p&lt;0.0001, 2-way ANOVA) (Figure 7E).

U94A expression in mature hCXN cultures inhibits neurite maturation

To determine the impact of U94A on more mature neurons, we isolated cells as before but cultured neuronal progenitor cells for three weeks to allow for maturation of the cultures prior to infection with U94A and control lentiviral vectors. Experiments were again analyzed at seven days post-infection. Using this approach, we achieved significant neuronal differentiation, with an average of 62% of control cells staining positive for the more mature neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 8A). While many U94A cells were able to differentiate, we observed a small but significantly lower number of NeuN positive neurons as compared to control (p=0.046, paired t-test) (Figure 8B). To ensure that this effect was not the result of astrocyte proliferation, we also immunostained for GFAP and found no significant difference in the proportion of GFAP positive astrocytes (p=0.715, paired t-test) (Figure 8C).

To determine whether U94A expression in differentiated neurons impacts their functional maturation, we focused on the analysis of synaptophysin and PSD-95, canonical markers of the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartment, respectively (Figure 9A). We found a marked decrease in the number of synaptophysin/PSD-95 double positive puncta in U94A samples, suggesting that U94A expression can either decrease synaptic density or inhibit synapse formation (p = 0.002, paired t-test) (Figure 9B). We found that this was likely due to a significant difference in immunofluorescence for synaptophysin (p=0.028, paired t-test) (Figure 9C). No difference in PSD-95 immunofluorescence was detected between groups (p=0.858, paired t-test ) (Figure 9D) These effects were also validated by Western blot analysis, with U94A cells expressing significantly less synaptophysin (p=0.042, paired t-test) with no significant difference in PSD-95 expression (p=0.474, paired t-test) (Figure 10A–C).

Discussion

This study reveals a significant impact of the viral latency gene U94A on human neural cell types. Our prior studies had found an impairment of U94A-expressing hOPCs in their ability to migrate both in vitro and after transplantation into the CNS[52]. The current study further explores the underlying mechanism and identifies molecular pathways in cell migration and process formation, that are disrupted in U94A-expressing human glial progenitors and differentiating neurons. Using SILAC analysis, we identified two proteins of interest, gelsolin and WASF1, that play dual roles in mediating actin dynamics and regulating aspects of oligodendrocyte maturation. WASF1 is capable of binding and activating the actin nucleating protein Arp2/3 and is required for the stabilization of lamellipodial protrusions [72, 73]. Inhibiting the function of WASF1 in OPCs results in inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and a decrease of the number of myelinated axons in vivo and leads to decreased process formation and branching [74, 75]. In addition, oligodendrocytes isolated from mice lacking WASF1 have fewer processes compared to normal controls [75]. Gelsolin is likewise required for OPC differentiation [76], with studies suggesting a role in controlling the shift in microtubule stability required for morphological maturation of OPCs [61]. A limitation of our SILAC experiments was the extended culture time necessary for isotope-labeled amino acid integration. Thus, we do not know the acute alteration in protein dynamics changes in cells expressing U94A. However, as U94A expression is occurs in the context of a chronic, latent infections, the long term changes in actin regulating proteins are likely to be affect cell behavior in HHV6A infected patients.

Based on the impact of U94A on actin-regulating proteins, we further analyzed the migration defects in vitro time lapse analysis. We found that while U94A-expressing hOPCs were able to initiate process formation, cells failed to maintain protrusions formed in the presence of ROCK-inhibitor. This observation would be consistent with the decreased expression of WASF1 which has been shown to be dispensable for the protrusion of lamellipodia [77], but is critical for their stability [56]. A defect in protrusion stability in U94A cells together with a decrease in WASF1 is also consistent with in vitro studies using WASF1-knockout fibroblast, where the leading edges are unstable and have short half-lives [73].

An important consequence of the impact of U94A on hOPC migration, which we have not tested here, is a potential disruption of guided migration. While there is a consensus that OPCs integrate both short and long ranges cues during development and in response to repair, the specific factors that drive these responses remain elusive (see for review [78]). Interestingly, studies in drosophila have revealed that factors such as protocadherins, ROBOs, netrin receptors, neuroligins, GPCRs, and channels are potential ligands of the WASF1 regulatory complex that controls actin cytoskeletal dynamics [79]. It is thus likely that U94A can also affect directed migration via WASF1 downregulation.

Many actin cytoskeleton constituents colocalize and interact with components of microtubules [80, 81] and can thereby affect processes underlying cellular maturation. For example, cytoplasmic gelsolin is required for OPC differentiation [76] and may play a role in stabilizing microtubule networks during morphological maturation [61]. While the mechanism of how this is achieved is not clear, studies on cancer cells have shown that gelsolin can directly interact with β-tubulin and other microtubules binding proteins like NAT10 and NuMA-1[82]. Decreasing the function of WASF1 in OPCs also results in inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation and a decrease of the number of myelinated axons in vivo. This decrease is associated with impaired process formation and branching [74, 75], although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood.

Based on the proposed roles of WASF1 and gelsolin in microtubule stabilization and OPC maturation, we tested whether the actin defects in U94A-expressing hOPCs are followed by decreases in the cytoskeletal complexity during differentiation. We saw a decrease in the complexity of β-tubulin-labeled processes in hOPCs, but process length and overall area was maintained. Regarding the underlying mechanism, we propose three potential scenarios: (i) U94A could directly target the cytoskeleton. While we express U94A in cells by stable, lentiviral transduction resulting in low level U94A expression, this is unlikely to cause disruption though mass action. However, addition of recombinant U94A protein to endothelial cells (ECs) has been shown to inhibit their migration and formation of capillary-like structures in vitro, suggesting a direct action of the protein on the cytoskeleton [51]. Such a scenario would be consistent with the inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation and MBP expression, which may be downstream of the morphological defects. (ii) U94A could directly inhibit MBP expression thereby interfering with cytoskeletal processes. As MBP is known to interact with microtubules to enhance their polymerization and bundling[83, 84], decreased levels of this protein could inhibit tubulin-dependent behaviors. However, as U94A expression affects the cytoskeleton of cells that do not express MBP, it is likely that this protein is not the sole target of U94A. (iii) U94A could act broadly at the level of gene expression, which could have divergent and independent effects on cytoskeletal and myelin genes. Our SILAC analysis provides some support for this possibility, although further experiments will be needed to identify the complete regulatory network that is affected by U94A.

The impairments we observed in U94A-expressing hOPCs could have important consequences for the brain’s ability to repair demyelinated lesions in disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), which is defined by axonal degradation, decreased neuronal conduction, and neurological disability (reviewed in [85]. The progression of MS is thought to be a consequence of inadequate repair of demyelinated lesions. This repair is performed by OPCs that are recruited to lesions, where they differentiate into oligodendrocytes to replace damaged myelin [86]. Considering that HHV-6 has been associated with MS pathology and that U94A expression impairs many of the processes that are needed for remyelination, it is possible that U94A plays a role in the progression of demyelinating disease [31].

Cytoskeletal proteins also have important structural functions in neurons and play a critical role in the formation of axons, dendrites and synapses and facilitate transport of vesicles, lipids, and essential organelles (for review see [87]). Microtubule dynamics have also been implicated in the remodeling of dendritic spine architecture that underlies memory formation [88]. We have demonstrated in our experiments that U94A expression in immature neurons impairs the formation of a complex, tubulin-based neuritic arbor. The complexity of a neuron’s dendritic arbor is intricately linked to its ability to both propagate electrical signals and to form synaptic connections with other neurons [89–91]. Interestingly, U94A-expressing hCXN cultures also have fewer NeuN positive mature neurons than controls, suggesting that reduced neurite complexity is accompanied by reduced neuronal maturation, or vice versa. In our experiments on mature human neurons, we also observed significantly less synaptophysin expression compared to controls. While we do not know whether this represents a failure in synapse formation or a loss of existing synapses, this may be the result of actin and tubulin dysregulation, given that both cytoskeletal proteins affect the organization of presynaptic elements [92]. It will be of interest in future studies to identify how U94A expression impacts other synaptic features. For example, dendritic spine morphogenesis is dependent on both tubulin and actin dynamics [93–95].

The impact of U94A on neuronal maturation and synapse formation or maintenance, is of particular interest in light of the specific and significant association identified between HHV-6A with AD [96]. The structural plasticity underlying memory formation is highly dependent on both actin and tubulin cytoskeletal dynamics [88], and alterations in structural plasticity appear to underlie spine loss in AD models, possibly linking the impairment of morphological dynamics of neurons caused by U94A to the most debilitating symptom of AD. The current state of the literature acknowledges both Aβ and tau, the two pathological proteins that accumulate in AD, as drivers of synaptic loss [97–100]. However, given that Aβ accumulation does not correlate with cognitive impairments in patients, and that areas severely affected by tau tangle formation do not necessarily undergo synapse loss [101], it is clear that other insults play a role in the dendritic pathology of AD. Intrinsic factors, such as alterations in signaling molecules and actin-modifying proteins, have been proposed in this regard [102–104]. in a similar disease-modifying manner, the presence of a latent HHV-6A infection and associated expression of U94A could be such a contributing factor.

A limitation of our study is that all defects we identified were generated from embryonically-derived cells grown in vitro and therefore do not represent the complexity and maturity of aged, human neurons. However, loss of synaptic elements represents an early stage of AD pathology[105, 106] and is apparent in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons grown in vitro. This cell type represents an immature rather than aged neuron and has been instrumental in defining early AD phenotypes [107–114].

Our observations on U94A-expressing human neurons recapitulate AD-associated defects such as the loss of synaptophysin, which plays a major role in the regulation of presynaptic vesicle release and synaptic plasticity[115],is specifically targeted by Aβ [116]. This loss has been correlated with cognitive decline[117]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the decreased levels of synaptophysin in U94A expressing-human neurons might exacerbate AD pathology. These studies are focus of ongoing work examining whether U94A expression in AD patient-derived neurons might indeed worsen pathological phenotypes.

Conclusion

Taken together, we believe that our studies on the impact of U94A in neural host cells will shed light on the potential role of latent HHV6 infections in neurodegenerative diseases. Our data also underscore the notion that latent viruses are not simply inactive residents of the human brain, but might contribute to the progression of neurodegenerative disease, such as MS and Alzheimer Disease.
