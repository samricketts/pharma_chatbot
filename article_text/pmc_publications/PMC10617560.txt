Abnormal α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregation characterizes the α-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, no suitable PET radiotracer for imaging α-syn in PD and MSA exists currently. Our structure-activity relationship studies identified 4-methoxy-N-(4-(3-(pyridin-2-yl)-3,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl)phenyl)benzamide (4i) as a potential PET radiotracer for imaging α-syn. In vitro assays demonstrated high binding of 4i to recombinant α-syn fibrils (Ki = 6.1 nM) and low affinity for Aβ fibrils in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) homogenates. 4i also exhibited high specific binding to AD, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration tissues as well as PD and MSA tissues, suggesting notable affinity to tau. Interestingly, [3H]4i had higher binding to pathologic α-syn aggregates in MSA than PD, indicating specific binding to MSA α-syn. Nonhuman primate PET studies confirmed good brain uptake and rapid washout for [11C]4i. Overall, [11C]4i may have potential as a PET radiotracer for imaging α-syn in MSA patients.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Misfolded protein aggregates in the central nervous system (CNS) are pathological hallmarks of most neurodegenerative diseases1. Insoluble α-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates are a pathological feature of α-synucleinopathies and its abnormal accumulations within the cytoplasm are commonly identified in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA)2, 3. α-Synucleinopathies are categorized into two classes according to fibrillar α-syn inclusions bodies: (1) Lewy bodies (LBs) or Lewy neurites (LNs) and (2) Papp-Lanths bodies or glia cell inclusions (GCIs). In PD and DLB, α-syn aggregates form insoluble intraneuronal inclusions as LBs4, 5 and LNs in axonal processes6 whereas in MSA, GCIs or Papp-Lanths bodies composed mainly of filamentous α-syn are found in oligodendrocytes7–9. Previous studies demonstrated that these α-synucleinopathies possess distinct structural and biological properties10–13.

Since aggregation of α-syn is apparently an early driver of the pathogenesis of PD and MSA, α-syn aggregates have been recognized as a suitable biomarker for imaging these α-synucleinopathies11, 14–16. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows for the non-invasive visualization and quantification of various in vivo biological processes including altered target expressions using a radiotracer. The quantification of α-syn aggregates using PET in patients with α-synucleinopathies has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for early-stage prognostic indications and evaluating disease-modifying therapeutics in slowing disease progression. The development of an α-syn radiotracer has been highly encouraged by the success of amyloid beta (Aβ)17–20 or tau21–24 PET probes for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Particularly, tau-based neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) occur in the later stage of disease progression with clinical features while the deposition of Aβ plaques precedes onset25. Similarly, early diagnosis of PD or MSA using an α-syn PET tracer would identify patients who could benefit most from α-syn therapeutic strategies currently under development. Despite the significance of detecting α-syn aggregates in PD or MSA patients, there is currently no clinical PET tracer available. [18F]ACI-12589, with a KD value of 22–30 nM in MSA tissues, has been found to present distinct uptake in the cerebellar white matter or peduncles of MSA patients consistent with α-syn pathology26.

There are several hurdles that make the development of an α-syn PET tracer difficult27. The first factor is binding affinity. Since the density of α-syn aggregates are much lower than Aβ plaques or tau NFTs (approximately 1/10 ~ 1/50 versus Aβ), α-syn ligands are required to exhibit a high binding affinity for α-syn fibrils28, 29. Also, achieving binding selectivity for an aggregated α-syn ligand versus Aβ or tau is very challenging due to the similar β-sheet-rich structure in each fibril30–32. Aβ pathology is observed in over 80% of total α-synucleinopathies (LBD and MSA)29, so it is essential that an α-syn PET tracer should distinguish α-syn aggregates from Aβ depositions. Furthermore, a successful α-syn PET tracer should have favorable physicochemical properties (e.g. MW, tPSA, LogD, etc) for brain or cell membrane permeability, favorable metabolism leading to polar metabolites, and low nonspecific binding33.

Numerous compounds targeting α-syn fibrils have been synthesized to date. For example, Borroni and colleagues disclosed in the patent literature radiolabeled N-phenylbenzamide analogs including [3H]BF2846 that involved different modifications of the structure except for the piperazine ring34. [3H]BF2846 and its congeners exhibited high binding affinity for α-syn in radioligand binding assays and ex vivo autoradiography studies (KD = 2.0 nM for [3H]BF2846)27. These analogs were also reported to have good target engagement, high brain penetration and low nonspecific binding in brain. Molecular docking and photoaffinity labeling studies from our lab suggested that there are putative multiple binding sites within α-syn fibrils and [3H]BF2846 and its analogs bind to site 9 preferentially35. However, the use of 18F-labeled analogs of BF2846 for in vivo imaging PET studies is limited due to their high binding affinity for Aβ fibrils.

In the current study, we performed a structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation of BF2846 in which the piperazine ring has been replaced with different heterocyclic moieties including diazaspirocyclic or bridged amino cores (Figure 1). This strategy has been used by our group previously to reduce the off-target binding of dopamine D3 antagonists36. The results of our studies indicated that it is possible to prepare α-syn radioligands having a reduced affinity for Aβ fibrils using this strategy. Our study also identified a novel radioligand that binds preferentially to α-syn fibrils in MSA versus PD brain samples using in vitro autoradiography in postmortem brain samples.

RESULTS

Chemistry.

The synthesis of the BF2846 analogs containing heterocyclic structures with varying sizes of diazaspirocyclic rings, as well as diazabridged rings is illustrated in Scheme 1A. In addition, pyridine isomers were introduced for Ar1 as a substitute for benzene attached to the amino core (Figure 2), potentially reducing the lipophilicity of the ligand for better brain uptake and pharmacokinetics. The common intermediates 1a-c were synthesized by the condensation of acyl chloride and aniline under basic conditions. Since the reaction for 1b prefers to form a di-amide in which two 4-methoxybenzamide moieties are bound with one amino-pyridine, the additional 4-methoxybenzamide was cleaved using refluxing with K2CO3 in aqueous methanol to afford the desired amide, 1b, in quantitative yield. Although less amount of the di-amide was found in the reaction to prepare 1c, the additional 4-methoxybenzamide was not removed under the same reaction conditions. However, the di-amide could be separated from 1c using flash chromatography.

Coupling of the aromatic ring with either a diazaspirocyclic or diazabridged amine was successfully accomplished by the Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling reaction. The reaction proceeded in a moderate to good yield (26–88%) using a third generation (G3) Buchwald precatalyst and a mixture of NaOtBu/Cs2CO3 as a base37. Although the mechanism has not been fully elucidated, it is believed that Cs2CO3 reduces the reactions sensitivity to moisture.

The Boc group was initially deprotected using HCl. However, even trace amounts of HCl resulted in 2,6-diazaspiro[3.3]heptane ring-opening for compound 3a, likely due to the high strain of this spirocyclic ring system. Consequently, compounds substituted with mono- or dichloro groups were detected in 1H NMR or LCMS data. The ring opening was avoided by instead using neat TFA, resulting in satisfactory yields (69–100%) of intermediates 3a-n.

Following deprotection to give secondary amines 3a-n, Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling with 2-bromopyridine or 3-bromoquinoline resulted in 4a-j and 4l-r in a yield ranging from 13 to 79%. For the introduction of quinoxaline in 4k, nucleophilic aromatic substitution was performed by heating 3h with 2-bromoquinoxoline for 16 h (52% yield). Analogs 5a-c were prepared from 1a using the Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling reaction (Scheme 1B). These analogs were designed by removing the N-pyridinylpiperazine moiety of BF2846 to explore the effect of Ar2 removal from the scaffold. Yields for 5a, 5b, and 5c were 35, 11, and 49%, respectively.

For radiolabeling with tritium or carbon-11, the methyl on a methoxy moiety in 4i was removed using neat BBr3, a strong Lewis acid (Scheme 2). The reaction proceeded for 24 h and yielded 40% of the isolated product. Since trace amounts of 4i can reduce the molar activity of radiolabeled 4i, flash chromatography was performed twice to completely purify precursor 6 from trace quantities of starting material 4i. No peak for the mass value (m/z) of 4i was detected in UHPLC-MS chromatograms of 6.

In vitro radioligand competition binding assays.

The target compounds were initially screened for α-syn binding affinity using recombinant α-syn fibrils by a 3-point screening assay and the results are displayed in Figure 2 as a heatmap. The three point (10 nM, 100 nM and 1 μM) screening system has previously been used by our group in the development of other CNS radiotracers (e.g. sigma-2 receptors ligands) since it efficiently identifies potential candidates from a library of purchased or synthesized compounds38, 39. [3H]BF2846 was used as radioligand for the α-syn binding competition assays since it was the lead compound for the SAR study.

In the heat map, the diazaspirocyclic analogs exhibited an overall low % inhibition of radioligand binding, of which the relatively larger diazaspirocyclic analogs 4f and g showed 53% and 65% inhibition at 1 μM in the screening assay. Among diazabridged analogs, 4i having 3.8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane as the amino core exhibited complete inhibition of radioligand binding at 1 μM. In contrast to 4i, bridged diamine rings containing either a one or three carbon atom bridge (i.e., 4h or 4l) displayed weak binding to α-syn. The 1,4-diazepan analog, 4m, was also tested and displayed complete inhibition of radioligand binding at 1 μM. Different heteroaromatic groups on Ar2 were introduced within 4c, 4j, and 4k; however, the % inhibition was decreased compared to 2-pyridyl congener. Interestingly, introduction of a chlorine substituent at the para-position of the pyridine ring in Ar2 of BF2846 dramatically decreased the binding affinity for α-syn. These data indicate that a 2-pyridine ring is the optimal substituent in Ar2 for binding to α-syn. Lastly, replacement of the benzene ring of Ar1 in BF2846 with a pyridine should significantly affect the physicochemical properties of BF2846 by lowering the lipophilicity of the molecule. Analogs 4o, p, q displayed inhibition of [3H]BF2846 binding to α-syn fibrils and were advanced to the full competition assay.

Compounds with high displacement of [3H]BF2846 in the primary screening assay (i.e., ≥50% displacement of [3H]BF2846 at 1 μM) were evaluated by generating full competition curves to determine their inhibition constants (Ki) for binding to both recombinant α-syn fibrils and Aβ aggregates in AD brain (Table 1). The Aβ binding profile of the compounds was investigated using AD brain tissue homogenates with [3H]PiB as a radioligand. The results of the binding assays allowed for the assessment of the compound’s selectivity for α-syn versus Aβ, a limitation that has hindered the development of BF2846 and its 18F-labeled analogs as an α-syn PET tracer. The full competition curves obtained for each compound are presented in Figure S1.

Table 1 shows that compounds 4i, 4m, and 4o exhibited nanomolar binding affinity for recombinant α-syn fibrils, with Ki values of 6.1, 8.7, and 5.0 nM, respectively. Notably, compound 4o, which contains a piperazine moiety, demonstrated the highest α-syn affinity, but also exhibited high binding affinity for Aβ. This result is similar to that of BF2846. In contrast, compounds 4i and 4m did not exhibit any significant binding to Aβ in the [3H]PiB binding assay. Compound 4q, which was initially expected to exhibit high binding affinity for α-syn according to the heat map, showed a Ki value of only 185 nM. The Ki values of other analogs ranged from 22 to 185 nM. These heterocyclic analogs 4i and 4m exhibited selective binding to α-syn over Aβ, indicating their potential utility as PET tracers for α-synucleinopathies. In summary, based on its favorable binding affinity and selectivity, 4i was identified as a promising candidate for α-syn PET tracer.

Compound 4i was also screened for affinity for tau in radioligand binding assays using a panel of tritiated tau radioligands in post-mortem human AD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) tissues (Figure 3). PSP and CBD brain homogenates were chosen because they represent 4R tauopathies, where AD is a mixed 3R/4R tauopathy. The results indicate that 4i had a modest affinity to 3R/4R tau in AD tissues, with a Ki value of 49 nM when [3H]MK-6240 was used as the radioligand. However, other tau radioligands were not significantly inhibited by unlabeled 4i, suggesting that these radioligands and 4i do not share the binding site in 3R/4R tau (Figure 3). Compound 4i also had weak binding to 4R tau in PSP and CBD brain homogenates as determined by competition assays using [3H]PM-PBB3, [3H]CBD-2115, [3H]PI-2620, and [3H]AV-1451. To confirm the potential off-target binding with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the brain, the bindings of 4i to a panel of GPCRs were investigated and resulted in no significant binding to these receptors (Table S1)40.

Photoaffinity Labeling studies.

To gain a better understanding of 4i binding within α-syn fibrils, an analog (CLX4i) containing a diazirine crosslinking tag instead of the methoxy group was synthesized and evaluated for the binding sites (Figure 4). As we have shown previously41, 42, upon irradiation with light at 365 nm, CLX4i covalently labels α-syn that can then be analyzed via bottom-up mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine the site where 4i was bound. Photoaffinity labeling of α-syn fibrils was assessed via this workflow, and a combination of parallel digests using both trypsin and gluC enabled accurate mapping of the 4i binding site. CLX4i showed crosslinking predominantly adjacent to site 9 (DMPVDPDNE, residues 115–123), along with secondary crosslinks identified at site 2 (GVVHGVATVAEKTKE, residues 47–61) and in the N-terminus (EGVVAAEK, residues 15–22). These regions are folded relatively similarly in the solid state NMR structure of in vitro α-syn fibrils (PDB ID 2n0a) and in the cryo-EM structure of α-syn fibrils isolated from MSA patients (PDB ID 6xyo)30, 43. Primary LC-MS/MS data are also presented in Figure S2-S4. BF2846 was previously characterized as a site 9 binder, with crosslinking of an azide derivative to the 81–96 fragment of α-syn42. Shifted C-terminal crosslinking suggests that 4i binds in a slightly different orientation than BF2846, although this may be partially be attributed to the longer diazirine crosslinking tag.

In vitro saturation binding assays.

Due to the potential differences between α-syn fibrils and patient brain-derived α-syn aggregates43, it is necessary to determine the maximum binding capacity (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]4i in both PD and MSA brain homogenates as well as α-syn fibrils (Figure 5). In addition, saturation binding of [3H]4i for KD measurements was assessed in AD, PSP and CBD brain homogenates (Figure S5). The comprehensive dataset is summarized in Table 2.

Consistent with inhibition assays, it was found that [3H]4i had a high binding affinity to α-syn fibrils and the synucleinopathies PD and MSA. It is of interest to note that the KD values of [3H]4i to α-syn fibrils was similar to that observed in the synucleinopathies PD and MSA. Contrary to what was expected from the data shown in Figure 3, [3H]4i exhibited high binding in AD homogenates and in PSP and CBD homogenates. Since the PSP and CBD samples used in the binding assay were devoid of Aβ and α-syn, the binding of [3H]4i likely reflects binding to 4R tau. Detailed in vitro autoradiography studies demonstrating the co-localization of [3H]4i binding with tau and not Aβ in tissue sections of AD, PSP and CBD brain will be published separately. However, the in vitro binding data described above (Table 2) suggest that [3H]4i binds with high affinity to aggregated tau proteins, in particular 3R/4R tau in AD and 4R tau in PSP and CBD.

Autoradiography.

Nuclear emulsion autoradiography of [3H]4i was performed on PD and MSA tissues to assess its binding affinity with α-syn aggregates known to exhibit structural variations (Figure 6). Nuclear emulsion autoradiography is a highly sensitive technique for detecting and visualizing the presence of radioactive material in a sample, offering excellent spatial resolution down to a few micrometers. The images revealed that [3H]4i more clearly identified α-syn aggregates in MSA compared to PD. The findings of this study suggest that [3H]4i may have a strong binding affinity with GCIs rather than LBs. The localization of α-syn aggregates in PD and MSA was confirmed by α-syn antibody using fluorescence microscopy.

To confirm the results observed in the nuclear emulsion autoradiography study, autoradiography studies were also conducted in tissue sections in PD (hippocampus), MSA (cerebellum) and age-matched control (frontal cortex) brain samples. The tissue sections for PD brain had high levels of α-syn and Aβ, whereas the MSA brain sections had only α-syn in the form of GCIs. The control brain was negative for α-syn and Aβ. The results of this study (Figure 7) clearly show that [3H]4i binds to α-syn in MSA and not PD and control brain sections. The low binding of [3H]4i in the region that contains Aβ plaques is also consistent with the in vitro binding assays suggesting that this radioligand binds with weak affinity to Aβ plaques. Blocking studies with unlabeled 4i confirm that the binding of [3H]4i is displacable in MSA brain (Figure S6).

The autoradiography data described above are not in agreement with the radioligand binding studies in brain tissue homogenates (Table 2). The autoradiography data suggest that the binding affinity of [3H]4i in PD tissue sections is not as high as the in vitro binding assays conducted in PD brain homogenates. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear, but our results highlight the need to confirm data obtained in radioligand binding assays using tissue homogenates with autoradiography studies in tissue sections of postmortem brain samples. We are currently conducting more detailed studies with [3H]4i to identify factors that may be responsible for this discrepancy between homogenate binding assays and autoradiography in tissue sections.

Radiosynthesis.

To enable in vivo imaging of α-syn in the brain, we employed a typical SN2 reaction using gas-phase carbon-11 in an automated synthesis module for [11C]4i (Scheme 3). The hydroxyl precursor 6, obtained by removal of a methoxy moiety from 4i, was used for the synthesis of [11C]4i. The crude product for [11C]4i was purified using preparative HPLC (Figure S7) and subsequently formulated for injection. Total synthesis time was 40 min and the radiochemical yield (RCY) was 8.0 ± 2.9% (decay corrected to end of bombardment), yielding 1079 ± 404 MBq of isolated activity (n = 4). The radiochemical purity and the molar activity for prepared [11C]4i were determined by analytical HPLC (Figure S8) and found to be over 99% and 106 ± 56 GBq/μmol, respectively. These results demonstrate that the radiosynthesis of [11C]4i is suitable for further preclinical and clinical studies.

Predicting Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) penetration.

The development of CNS imaging PET tracers faces several challenges, with BBB penetration being one of the most significant. To predict BBB penetration of heterocyclic analogs including 4i, the Brain Or Intestinal EstimateD permeation method (BOILED-Egg) was performed44, 45 (Figure S9). This method was proposed for the brain access of small molecules based on partition coefficient that was developed by Wildman and Crippen (WLOGP)46 and the topological polar surface area (tPSA). In the BOILD-Egg plot, 4i was placed in the yolk, suggesting this compound is BBB-penetrant. In order to improve the accuracy of the prediction, LogD7.4 of [11C]4i was experimentally confirmed using the shake-flask method, resulting in a value of 2.52 ± 0.01 (n = 5). Thus, [11C]4i possesses suitable physicochemical properties for in vivo brain PET imaging studies.

In vivo brain PET analysis of [11C]4i in nonhuman primates (NHP).

A dynamic PET study was carried out in NHPs to investigate the potential of [11C]4i as an in vivo brain PET tracer, with a focus on pharmacokinetic and imaging properties (Figure 8). As predicted by BOILED-Egg plot modeling based on favorable physicochemical properties, [11C]4i showed BBB penetration in the initial PET images. The PET images demonstrated that [11C]4i exhibited relatively high uptake in the putamen and cerebellum, particularly. The time-activity curves (TACs) revealed that the peak uptake of the whole brain occurred at 4 min with standardized uptake value (SUV) of 1.68 ± 0.54. Furthermore, the brain concentration of [11C]4i decreased rapidly over time, with no significant signals observed at 30–40 min after injection (SUV = 0.85 ± 0.18). The brain concentration ratio between 4 to 60 min was approximately 2.5, indicating [11C]4i should have a high signal-to-background ratio for imaging α-syn aggregates. Therefore, the demonstrated good brain permeability and rapid washout suggest that [11C]4i is a suitable candidate for an in vivo brain PET tracer. Whole body distribution PET images and TACs are presented in Figure S10.

Metabolism study.

Since radiometabolites can influence a tracer’s efficacy as PET imaging agent, metabolite profiling was performed by HPLC system of NHP blood. The obtained chromatograms demonstrated that [11C]4i underwent metabolism, yielding one major polar metabolite along with minor metabolites within 30 min. The percentage of the parent [11C]4i remaining at 5, 15, and 30 min amounted to 58%, 28%, and 14%, respectively. Under the same condition, additional HPLC chromatogram was examined to identify potential metabolites. The analysis revealed that the predominant polar metabolite observed, while a minor metabolite, N-(4-(3,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl)phenyl)-4-[11C]methoxybenzamide, was also detected. In vitro assays were conducted to assess the binding affinity of predicted metabolite, including N-(4-(3,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-yl)phenyl)-4-methoxybenzamide and 4-methoxy-N-phenylbenzamide, for α-syn in vitro. In the assay, these compounds exhibited no binding to recombinant α-syn. Although the BOILED-Egg modeling predicted BBB penetrance for these metabolites, the polar metabolites are likely to be cleared from the brain, as shown in the brain PET images.

DISCUSSION

In vivo imaging of α-syn has significant implications for the early diagnosis, monitoring, and the assessment of therapeutic intervention of the family of neurodegenerative disorders referred to as the synucleinopathies. Since the current diagnosis of α-synucleinopathies based on clinical symptoms and neuroimaging techniques such as MRI is limited in detecting α-syn pathology in the early stages of the disease47, numerous studies have focused on developing ligands with high binding affinity that can specifically localize α-syn27, 41, 48, 49. The necessary criteria for in vivo CNS imaging studies as a PET tracer includes high binding affinity and selectivity for the target of interest, and good physicochemical properties leading to high initial brain uptake and fast washout from regions representing nonspecific binding of the radiotracer.

The objective of this study was to conduct an SAR study investigating the replacement of the piperazine moiety of the lead compound, BF2846, with bridged or spirocyclic diamines. We previously demonstrated that this substitution was successful in developing selective ligands for other protein targets, including the dopamine D3 receptor36, sigma-2 receptor39, or PARP-150. We hypothesized that this isosteric replacement of the piperazine ring may improve the selectivity of this scaffold for α-syn versus Aβ fibrils. Our efforts focused on BF2846 since we have shown that it preferentially binds to site 9 (G86-F94-K96) within α-syn fibrils35, which is expected to be less influenced by posttranslational modification of α-syn compared to other binding sites51. It is noteworthy that phosphorylation at S129 accounts for up to 90% of α-syn in LBs and phosphorylated S87 or Y39 has also been observed in postmortem brain tissues from PD or MSA patients52–54.

The results from in vitro binding assays showed that 4i containing the 3.8-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane moiety exhibited a nanomolar binding affinity for α-syn and had a lower binding affinity for Aβ presented in tissue homogenates from AD brain. Although the mechanism behind this selectivity is not well understood, it is possible that the geometric difference between 4i and BF2846 could be responsible55 for this observation. We also found that 4i binds somewhat differently to in vitro α-syn fibrils than BF2846 based on crosslinking studies, which could also be due to the geometric differences between 4i and BF2846. It is of interest to note that the sites to which 4i binds are relatively well-conserved between in vitro fibrils (2n0a) and fibrils isolated from MSA patients (6xyo, Fig. 4). This observation supports the favorable binding to MSA tissue observed in the autoradiography studies.

Although replacement of the piperazine moiety of BF2846 with the 3.8-dizabicyclo[3.2.1]octane moiety in 4i increased the selectivity for α-syn versus Aβ, [3H]4i displayed high binding affinity for AD, CBD and PSP tissue homogenates, indicating high affinity binding of [3H]4i to aggregated tau. Interestingly, this result may reflect binding to a novel site on aggregated tau since 4i did not have high affinity for displacing the known tau radioligands [3H]PM-PBB3, [3H]CBD-2115, [3H]PI-2620, and [3H]AV-1451 in homogenate assays. PET imaging studies in NHPs also indicated that [11C]4i had good brain uptake and rapid tracer washout from the brain, thereby increasing the potential for successful in vivo imaging of MSA with PET. In the metabolism study, [11C]4i was rapidly metabolized into polar metabolites, these metabolites showed no binding to α-syn fibrils. [11C]4i is in the process of being advanced to first-in-human imaging studies in control subjects and MSA patients.

CONCLUSION

The goal of this study was to develop a PET tracer for α-syn detection in the brain by conducting an SAR investigation on BF2846. Our SAR study led to the identification of a promising candidate, 4i, and in vitro binding assays demonstrated its high affinity and selectivity for α-syn versus Aβ aggregates. Moreover, the ability to detect α-syn aggregates in MSA but not PD was demonstrated by nuclear emulsion and autoradiography in tissue sections. These data suggest that [11C]4i may be more useful in detecting GCIs in patients with MSA than LBs in patients with PD. The high binding affinity for tau proteins may limit the utility of [11C]4i under certain circumstances. However, the absence of tau in the cerebellum suggests that it may be possible to image α-syn GCIs in MSA-Cerebellar type subjects. The favorable phamacokinetic properties of [11C]4i for in vivo brain imaging observed in our study, including high binding affinity for α-syn, high initial brain uptake and rapid washout, suggest that this PET tracer may be useful for early detection and monitoring of MSA.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

General.

Commercial reagents and solvents were purchased from reputable sources, including Sigma-Aldrich (MO, U.S.A.), Synthonix (NC, U.S.A.), Enamine (Kyiv, UA), or Thermo fisher scientific (MA, U.S.A.), and used as received. Compounds 1a-c were synthesized by the modification of known literature34. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using TLC silica gel 60W F254S plates for monitoring reactions, and the spots were visualized under UV light (254 nm). Flash chromatography purifications were conducted on a Biotage Isolera One system (Uppsala, Sweden). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker NEO-400 spectrometer (Bruker, MA, U.S.A.) with chemical shifts (δ) reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to the deuterated solvent as an internal reference. Mass spectra (m/z) were acquired on a 2695 Alliance LC-MS (Waters Corporation, MA, U.S.A.) with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+), and high resolution mass spectra (HRMS, m/z) were obtained using a waters LCT premier mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, MA, U.S.A.). The purity of investigated analogs was determined prior to the screening and confirmed to be &gt; 95% by UHPLC-MS (Table S3). Recombinant α-syn fibrils preparation including α-syn protein expression and purification was performed according to the literature10. For Aβ assay, AD brain sample was provided by the Penn Brain Bank and most of the white matter was removed before weighing the tissue. AD brain homogenates were prepared and stored at −80 °C before each binding assay56. Human PD tissue sample used in the homogenate binding assays was provided by Dr. Thomas Beach of the Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ. Experiments with human post-mortem tissues were approved by the institutional review board and performed in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. All animal studies were performed under protocols approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

In vitro radioligand binding competition assay

α-Syn assay using [3H]BF2846.

Three concentrations of tested compounds (10 nM, 100 nM and 1 μM) and [3H]BF2846 (~4 nM) were added to 50 nM of recombinant α-syn fibrils in a working buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). The mixture (150 μL) was gently mixed by agitation, covered, and then incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h in a non-binding 96 well plate (Corning, 3605). The mixture was filtered through a Unifilter-96 harvesting system (Perkin Elmer), then washed three times with 250 μL of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 15 mM NaCl and 20 % EtOH. 50 μL of scintillation cocktail (MicroScint-20, PerkinElmer) was added to the collected filtrate and counted on a Microbeta system (Perkin Elmer). Total binding was measured in the absence of tested compounds and nonspecific binding was defined by the presence of 100 nM unlabeled BF2846 in the working buffer. The data analysis was carried out in the following equations and graphically presented with a heatmap.

Percentageinhibition%=(1−CompetitorBindingCounts−NonspecificBindingCountsTotalBindingCounts−NonspecificBindingCounts)×100

For the full curve of α-syn binding affinity, [3H]BF2846 (~4 nM) was incubated with fixed concentrations of 50 nM α-syn fibrils and ten concentrations of tested compounds (0.05 nM-1000 nM). All data points were collected in three individual experiments. The equilibrium dissociation constants, Ki values, were obtained from EC50 using the equation Ki = EC50/(1+[radioligand]/KD) by non-linear regression from GraphPad Prism v.9.3.1.

Aβ assay using [3H]PiB.

Three concentrations of tested compounds (10 nM, 100 nM and 1 μM), [3H]PiB (~32 nM) and 0.5 μg/μL of AD, CAA- tissue homogenate (Tissue ID: 05–215) in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) were added to each well of non-binding 96 well plate. Nonspecific binding was defined by 1 μM of unlabeled PiB in DPBS. Following procedures were performed in the same procedure as α-syn assay using DPBS instead of the working buffer.

Post-mortem PSP and CBD Tissues.

The binding assays utilized fresh frozen, autopsy-confirmed, post-mortem human PSP and CBD brain tissue blocks (1 cm3) obtained from the Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank at the University of Califonia, San Francisco, containing only frequent 4R-tau aggergates (PSP tissue, superior frontal gyrus, or CBD tissue, middle frontal gyrus), and no other detectable aggregated amyloid or TDP-43 species. The frozen tissue blocks were separately thawed and homogenized in ice-cold pH 7.0 PBS at 300 mg/mL on ice using a glass homogenizer, diluted 30-fold with PBS to 10 mg/mL and homogenized a second time with a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer before storage at −80 °C. At the time of binding assays, frozen brain tissue homogenates were thawed to RT and diluted 10-fold in PBS to a concentration of 1 mg/mL.

In vitro competition (Ki) assays of [3H]4i vs. titrated tau radioligands.

The equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) values of unlabeled 4i were determined versus tritiated tau radioligands using published methods56. Briefly, the concentration of 4i (~400 μM in the stock solution) was determined by quantitative NMR in DMSO-d6 (0.25% DMSO in the final assay vials). The appropriate concentrations (ranging from 0.1 to 1000 nM) of 4i in 400 μL of Tris buffer (pH 7.0) were combined with 500 μL of tritiated radioligand in Tris buffer (~1 nM final concentration of radioligand). The assay was initiated by the addition of 100 μL of 1 mg/mL brain tissue homogenate to achieve a final concentration of 100 μg tissue/mL. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with shaking, the binding mixture was filtered through a Whatman GF/B glass filter via a Brandel M-24R cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and rapidly washed four times with 3 mL Tris buffer. The filters were counted in Cytoscint-ES after thorough vortexing using a liquid scintillation counter. Complete (100%) inhibition of specific binding was defined as the number of counts displaced by 1 μM of the unlabeled radioligand. All assays were performed in triplicate at each concentration.

In vitro saturation assays of [3H]4i for various neurodegenerative postmortem brain tissues.

To a 400 nM of recombinant α-syn fibrils or 50 μg/well of a panel of postmortem brain samples (e.g., PD, MSA, or AD) in PBS or Tris buffer was added ten concentrations of [3H]4i (1.56-fold dilution, 0.5 nM to 40 nM) and the total volume was made 150 μL. The total binding and nonspecific binding are defined by the absence of and the presence of 1 μM of unlabeled 4i, respectively. Following procedures were performed in the same procedure as α-syn assay. The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD and maximal specific binding, Bmax are determined by fitting the data into equation Y = Bmax×X/(X+KD) via non-linear regression from GraphPad Prism v.9.3.1.

KD in PSP and CBD tissue homogenates were measured according to previously described method with minor modifications57. 4i was dissolved in DMSO at 400 μM and then diluted to 20 μM with PBS to yield 5% DMSO/PBS. The remaining serial dilutions (typically from 6 μM to 4 nM) were made with 5% DMSO/PBS to maintain a constant DMSO concentration in the final assay tubes. 50 μL of these solutions were combined with same volume of [3H]4i and 800 μL of Tris buffer (pH 7.0) to yield 0.25% DMSO, ~1 nM [3H]4i and 0.2 to 1000 nM of 4i in the final assay. The assay began by addition of 100 μL of the 1 mg/mL brain homogenate to achieve a final concentration of 100 μg tissue/mL. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C with shaking, the binding mixture was filtered through a Whatman GF/B glass filter via a Brandel M-24R cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD) and rapidly washed three times with 3 mL Tris buffer. The filters were counted in Cytoscint-ES after thorough vortexing and sitting overnight. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. The concentration of bound compound was determined from the radioactivity retained on the filter after correcting for the non-displaceable radioactivity (defined as that remaining with ~1 μM of 4i) and the specific activity of the [3H]4i after dilution with varying concentrations of 4i. The KD value was determined by the slope (slope = −1/KD) of a Scatchard plot of the bound/free vs. bound radioligand values at the different ligand concentrations, and the Bmax value was determined by the x-axis intercept of the bound/free vs. bound line.

Nuclear emulsion autoradiography.

Frozen postmortem PD and MSA brain tissue samples were sectioned on a cryostat at 16 μm and mounted onto glass slides and stored at −80 °C. To quench lipofusin autofluorescence, slides were incubated in 1X TrueBlack (Biotium) in 70% EtOH. Slides were incubated sequentially with anti-phospho-α-syn (S129) antibody (p-syn/81A, BioLegend) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody to immunostain LBs and LNs. Slides were then incubated in 15 nM of [3H]4i diluted in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 2 h at 37 °C. The slides were washed in 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 min, 50% ethanol/30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 min, 30% ethanol/30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 min, 30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 min, and MQH2O for 1 sec. The slides were allowed to completely air dry in a fume hood. To obtain high resolution autoradiographic information, the slides were dipped in autoradiography emulsion (Carestream Type NTB) and incubated in the dark for 4 days. The slides were developed in Ilford Phenisol Developer for 4 min, 200 mL of 1% acetic acid for 2 min, 200 mL of 1:4 Ilford Hypam Fixer for 4 min, and 200 mL of MQH2O for 4 min (2x). The slides were allowed to completely air dry in the fume hood before a coverslip was applied with Fluoromount-G Mounting Medium. Photomicrographs of fluorescent antibody staining and tritium activated silver grains were obtained on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U Inverted Fluorescence Microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) microscope using fluorescence and brightfield/monochrome light, respectively.

In vitro real-time autoradiography.

For [3H]4i autoradiography fresh frozen brains derived from PD and MSA cases were sliced in 10-μm-thick sections, mounted on Super Frost Plus slides and stored at −80 °C until further processing. Sections were allowed to thaw for 30 min at RT and then pre-incubated with PBS + 0.1% BSA buffer, pH 7.5 for 15 min under constant gentle shaking. Sections were then incubated for 90 min using the same buffer containing 5 nM of [3H]4i. Nonspecific binding was determined via co-incubation with 1 μM 4i. Following incubation, slides were washed 2 × 5 min in ice-cold (4 ºC) PBS + 20% EtOH and 1 × 1 min in ice-cold dH2O, and then dried with a hot plate. Images were obtained by using the BeaQuant, a new generation of gas detector for real time autoradiography. Briefly, a strip of copper adhesive tape was placed on the back of each microscope slide. A compressed air gun from the preparation station was applied to each samples to remove dust from the entire surface of the glass slide. Afterwards the samples were placed in the sample holder in a way that the samples must face the worktop and the copper adhesive tape must point upwards. The sample holder was covered with a compression plate and loaded in the BeaQuant and the gas injection was allowed to start. The image acquisition was performed for 1h using the acquisition software called Beavacq. Regions of interest (ROIs) were determined manually of each section on the scanned images using Beamage software. The signal on the scanned images was given as average counts per pixel expressed as count per min per mm2 (cp/mim/mm2). Based on these measurements, specific binding values were calculated in the presence of 4i (total binding – nonspecific binding).

Immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry was performed on fresh frozen sections adjacent to those used for autoradiography. Sections were fixed in ethanol for 15 min, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS Tween-20 buffer, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton™ X-100 for 10 min followed by 3 × 5 min washes in PBST. Sections were then blocked with PBS + 10% goat serum + 1% BSA + 0.1 % Tween 20 for 1 h at RT, followed by the appropriate primary antibody (Table S2)- S129 antibody (P-syn/81A), anti-beta amyloid (DE2B4) antibody, anti phospho-tau (Ser202, Thr205) antibody, details in the Table 1, used at 1:500 dilution for 16 h at 4 ºC. After a series of thorough washes with PBS Tween 20 buffer, the slides were incubated with the secondary antibodies- Alexa Fluor® 568, Alexa Fluor® 488, Alexa Fluor® 647, details in Table 2, at 1: 1000 dilution for 1 h at RT. The sections were then washed again with PBS Tween 20, 3 × 5 min, mounted with Duolink in situ mounting media with DAPI and coverslips for microscopy. Images were captured with a Zeiss microscope at 10X magnification.

Radiochemistry.

Radiosynthesis of [11C]4i was performed in a Synthra MeIplus module with [11C] CH3I that was prepared via the gas phase method. [11C]CO2 was produced by 14N(p,α)11C nuclear reaction, reduced to [11C]CH4 using Ni catalyst and then, converted to [11C]CH3I through an iodine column. The prepared [11C]CH3I was bubbled at −30 °C to a mixture of 5 (1 mg, 2.5 μmol) and 1.5 μL of 5 N NaOH (3 equiv) in 0.5 mL of DMF, which had been vigorously mixed for 1 min. The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 5 min and quenched at RT with 1 mL of HPLC mobile phase. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (column: Phenomenex Luna® 5 μm C18 100Å, 10×250 mm, eluent: MeCN/10 mM NH4HCO3 (60:40), wavelength: 254 nm, flow rate: 4.5 mL/min, Rt: 10 min).

For microPET studies in NHP, purified [11C]4i was formulated. The collected fraction from HPLC was mixed with prefilled 50 mL of water and the mixture was passed on 7cc tC18 cartridge. The trapped [11C]4i was washed with 10 mL of water, eluted by 1 mL of EtOH, and diluted with 9 mL of normal saline. The prepared [11C]4i solution was filtered through Millex-GV filter (0.22 μm) for the injection. Radioactivity in the final product vial was measured using a dose calibrator (Capintec).

Radiochemical purity and the molar activity was determined by analytical HPLC prior to the PET study (column: waters acquity UHPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm C18 130Å, 2.1×50 mm, eluent: MeCN/ 0.1% TFA in water (73:27), wavelength: 254 nm, flow rate: 0.5 mL/min, Rt: 1.3 min).

Partition coefficient (LogD7.4).

Shake-flask method was used to determine LogD7.4 of [11C]4i using 5 mL of n-octanol and 10 mL of 0.01 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution. 10 μL of [11C]4i was added to the n-octanol/0.01 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution and the mixture was vigorously mixed for 1 min and placed for 20 min to be separated. Five aliquots (1 mL) of each phase were collected and counted using a Wizard2 2480 gamma counter (Perkin Elmer). LogD7.4 was expressed as the log value of the partition ratio between the two phases and averaged over 5 replicates (mean ± SD).

PET studies of [11C]4i in nonhuman primates.

Dynamic whole body PET of [11C]4i was conducted on a 25 ± 2 year old adult male rhesus macaque using the PennPET Explorer scanner. The monkey, fasted for 12 h prior to the PET study, was initially anesthetized by intramuscular injection with ketamine (4 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (0.05 mg/kg). The monkey was intubated and anesthesia was maintained with 0.75–2% isoflurane/oxygen. A percutaneous catheter was placed for the tracer injection. A low dose CT scan was performed to confirm positioning and attenuation correction followed by 90 min dynamic PET images (12×10 sec, 2×30 sec, 4×60 sec, 2×120 sec, 3×180 sec, 2×300 sec, 2×600 sec and 2×1200 sec) acquired in list mode after venous injection of 104 ± 5 MBq of [11C]4i. The PET image was reconstructed using time-of-flight list-mode ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM, 25 subsets) reconstruction algorithm58. The PET/CT imaging data was analyzed by using Pmod software (version 3.7, PMOD Technologies Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland). Seven volumes of interest (VOIs) for brain including caudate, putamen, thalamus, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum, and whole brain were manually delineated on a T1-weighted MR image. Additional six VOIs for non-central nervous system including left ventricle, spleen, liver, spine, kidneys, and bladder were also manually delineated on PET or CT image for whole body distribution. TACs were extracted from all the VOIs and expressed as percent injected dose per cm3 (%ID/cm3) and SUV.

Metabolism study.

Blood analysis was conducted on venous samples collected at 5, 15, and 30 min post-injection. Whole blood and plasma activities were measured using a Wizard2 2480 gamma counter (Perkin Elmer). Plasma samples were deproteinated by adding an equal volume of MeCN. The resulting plasma supernatant was then filtered through 0.45 μm Titan3™ syringe filters (Thermo Scientific™) and processed using a 1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies). The HPLC analysis utilized an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 μm, 150×4.6 mm) with isocratic mobile phase of 73% TFA (0.1% v/v) and 27% MeCN, operating at a flow rate: 1.5 mL. Radioactivity was detected using a Posi-RAM radio-HPLC detector (LabLogic Systems). The Rt of the major polar metabolite was determined to be 1.3 min, while that of [11C]4i was 6.1 min, which was confirmed by non-radioactive 4i.
