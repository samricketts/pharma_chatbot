INTRODUCTION:

Clinically, detection of disease-causing pathology associated with AD and VCID is limited to MRI and PET scans, which are expensive and not widely accessible. Here, we assess angiogenic, inflammatory, and AD-related plasma biomarkers to determine their relationships with human post-mortem neuropathology.

METHOD:

Plasma samples were analyzed using a digital immunoassay and pathological evaluation was performed by UK-ADRC neuropathologists. The association of plasma markers with neuropathology was estimated via proportional odds and logistic regressions adjusted for age.

RESULTS:

Included cases (N = 90) showed increased Tau/Aβ42 ratio, GFAP, VEGF-A, and PlGF were positively associated with higher level of AD neuropathological change, while higher Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was inversely associated. Higher PlGF, VEGF-A and IL-6 were inversely associated with chronic cerebrovascular disease, while Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was positively associated.

DISCUSSION:

Our results provide support for the continued study of plasma biomarkers as a clinical screening tool for AD and VCID pathology.

pmcINTRODUCTION:

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) are often co-morbid in patients with dementia1,2. Currently, these conditions are diagnosed using cognitive evaluations and neuroimaging studies3,4. Diagnosis typically comes well into the course of the disease as patients do not often show cognitive decline until years after amyloid pathology begins to develop5. Blood-based biomarkers of disease have only been possible in recent years because we previously lacked the necessary sensitivity to measure relevant biomarkers accurately6. Recently, technological developments have made measuring picogram per mL concentrations more reliable using Single-molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (SiMoAs)7,8. However, the relation between these new blood-based biomarkers and neuropathologically evaluated disease remains unclear.

The current standard for neuropathological evaluation of AD is the 2012 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (“ABC”) guidelines, which include three measures of pathology9. The “A” component, Thal staging, evaluates distribution of amyloid beta plaques, noting progression from the neocortical brain region to the brainstem and cerebellum10. The “B” component, Braak staging, evaluates the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles as they progress from the entorhinal cortex to the neocortex11. The “C” component, Consortium to Establish a Registry in Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) scores, evaluates the density of neuritic plaques in the neocortex12. Together, these scores describe the degree to which AD neuropathological changes (ADNC) have occurred9. Clinically, more severe neuritic plaque (“C”) and neurofibrillary tangle ratings (“B”) have been shown repeatedly to correlate with cognitive impairment and dementia9. While PET neuroimaging has been shown to identify brain amyloid and tau in vivo, it remains costly and inaccessible for most of the population13,14.

VCID encompasses multiple cerebrovascular pathologies that affect cognition, such as arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and microinfarctions1. Clinically, cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), a subtype of VCID characterized by arteriolosclerosis and microinfarctions, is diagnosed based on white matter hyperintensities (WMH) seen on MRI15,16. These pathologies may be evaluated on autopsy by a neuropathologist and are scored in different ways. Arteriolosclerosis and CAA, for example, may be rated from none to severe, while infarctions are often counted in multiple sampled sections throughout the brain17,18.

Fluid biomarkers can be used as both diagnostic and prognostic indicators to assist the physician in their decision-making process and are vital to the rapidly developing treatment of dementia19,20. Currently, several CSF biomarkers are available for clinical evaluation of Aβ42, Aβ40, and tau levels, which correlate well with observed AD neuropathology21. However, the procedure for collecting CSF, a lumbar puncture, remains invasive and frightening for many patients.

Plasma and serum biomarkers, such as Aβ42 to Aβ40 ratio; pTau181, a phospho-epitope of tau; and GFAP have been studied using SiMoAs and ultrasensitive immunoassays. These studies show positive correlations between biomarker levels in the plasma and the CSF, and distinct differences between AD patients and controls20,22,23. Specifically, the ratio of Aβ42 to Aβ40 has been shown to be reduced in the plasma of patients with AD compared to controls24–27. GFAP, as measured in serum, has also been shown to differentiate AD patients from cognitively normal controls23. Studies have also demonstrated that plasma pTau181 is not only positively associated with tau PET entorhinal cortex SUVR in patients with Aβ PET positivity based on SUVR, but also significantly associated with Aβ PET positivity based on SUVR28. Plasma biomarker development for VCID is less developed than for AD but is rapidly catching up, in large part due to the MarkVCID consortium founded in 2016. MarkVCID aims to identify and validate both fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers for VCID in a multi-center cohort29.

Plasma biomarkers are much less expensive than neuroimaging, more easily accessible to patients, and they are minimally invasive. In the current study, we evaluated the relationship between a set of plasma-based angiogenic, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative biomarkers measured during the last two years of life and neuropathological hallmarks of AD and VCID observed at autopsy. Study participants were drawn from the longitudinal cohort study at the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.

METHODS:

Participant Selection and Plasma Collection

Participants in this study were selected from the cohort enrolled at the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UK-ARDC) who had died and come to brain autopsy (N = 916). The UK-ADRC recruitment procedures and other methods have been previously described30. Briefly, participants consented to approximately annual study visits that included cognitive testing, physical examination, neurological examination, medical history, and other measures, and brain autopsy upon death. All participants provided written informed consent for their participation in UK-ADRC research activities, which were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board.

Beginning in 2012, plasma samples were collected during annual study visits by venous puncture using 10 mL EDTA Vacutainer tubes; prior to 2012 only heparinized vacutainer tubes were used. Participants were selected for the current study if they had a banked plasma sample that was collected in an EDTA tube and within the two years prior to death (N = 90). One sample per participant, closest to death, was retrieved for this study.

Plasma Sample Analysis

Plasma samples were stored at −80°C until retrieved and thawed on ice. Samples were then centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes at maximum speed (approx. 21,000 x g). Samples were then plated at room temperature using the dilutions listed (Table 1) and run on the Quanterix Simoa HD-X in duplicate8. Simoa immunoassays for phosphorylated threonine-181 tau (pTau181), neurofilament light (NfLight), total Tau (Tau), amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), amyloid beta 40 (Aβ40), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), interleukin 10 (IL10), interleukin 6 (IL6), interleukin 8 (IL8), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and placental growth factor (PlGF) were run. Due to limited quantities of plasma from some participants, sample size was reduced for pTau181 and TNFα assessments (Table 2).

After the run completed, data were retrieved, and the results were multiplied by the dilution factor. All biomarkers were log transformed and outliers from each biomarker set were removed using the generalized extreme studentized deviate test: VEGF-A (N = 1), MMP9 (N = 1), TGFβ (N = 1), Aβ 42 (N = 1), Tau (N = 3), Aβ 42/ Aβ 40 Ratio (N = 1), Tau/ Aβ 42 Ratio (N = 3), TNFα (N = 4).

Neuropathology

Assessments

All assessments were performed blind to clinical and biomarker information. Neuropathological assessments for AD were conducted using the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) guidelines (i.e., Thal phase, Braak Stage, and CERAD plaque ratings)17.

Data operationalizations

Thal phase, Braak Stage, and CERAD ratings were converted to the scoring of the NIA-AA guidelines (each on a 0–3 scale), and AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) was categorized according to the guidelines17. For analysis of the individual components, Braak stage and CERAD ratings were dichotomized, such that the lowest two scores (0 and 1) were combined as well as the highest two scores (2 and 3), due to small numbers of cases with the highest and lowest ratings. Assessments of CAA and global arteriolosclerosis utilized the ordinal rating scales from the NACC Neuropathology Data Element Dictionary (v10) with responses (scored as 0–3) to designate ‘none’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’ or ‘severe’, respectively. Due to small cell sizes, ‘moderate’ and ‘severe’ categories were combined for both CAA and global arteriolosclerosis.

Chronic vascular grade was determined using a novel ordinal rating system to assess global level of cSVD. Brains were graded by a neuropathologist on a scale from 0–3, where 0 indicated no signs of arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, other small vessel changes, or infarctions. A score of 1 denotes arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, or other small vessel changes but with no infarctions, while a score of 2 indicates small vessel changes with chronic microinfarctions. A score of 3 represents small vessel changes with chronic gross infarcts. Analysis of chronic vascular grade excluded participants with a score of 3 as this model focused on the relationship between small vessel disease and plasma biomarkers.

Statistical Analysis

Proportional odds and binary logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between plasma biomarkers (independent variable) and different vascular and AD neuropathologies (dependent variable). Proportional odds logistic models were used for neuropathologies with ordinal measurements, i.e., CAA, arteriolosclerosis, chronic vascular grade, and Aβ plaque score. Binary logistic models were for binary outcome measurements, i.e., dichotomized Braak stage and neuritic plaque score. All models were adjusted for age of the participant at autopsy, and separate models were estimated for each pathology and biomarker; sample size for each model is reported in table 2. Odds ratios obtained from the model results indicate the relative change in age-adjusted odds of more severe pathology for a 1-unit increase in the log-transformed plasma biomarker level.

Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the results to the inclusion of sex, hypertension (yes vs. no), diabetes (yes vs. no), and APOEe4 allele status (any vs. none) as additional covariates. All data analysis was performed with MATLAB. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. False discovery rate for multiple comparison testing was conducted for each neuropathology analysis independently using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.31

RESULTS:

Study Participant Characterization

Participants from the UK-ADRC autopsy cohort with banked plasma samples within two years of death were included in this study (N = 90). The sample was mean age 82.0±9.2 years at autopsy and comprised 46.7% female participants (Table 3). This sub-population is comparable in age at death, 82.8±9.3 years, but with a smaller percentage of females (58.9% female) than the larger autopsy cohort. A self-reported history of hypertension and diabetes, both risk factors for vascular dementia, was found in 72.2% and 21.4% of the study population, respectively (Table 3); both were greater than the observed proportions in the larger autopsy cohort of 65.8% and 17.7%, respectively32,33. A relatively high proportion of the study sample, 37.5%, carried at least one APOEe4 allele (Table 3), which is comparable to the larger autopsy cohort at 43.0%. Clinically, 46.1% of participants were cognitively normal at their last clinical visit, 38.2% were diagnosed with dementia, while 12.8% had a final diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A small number (3.4%) were mildly impaired on cognitive testing but did not meet criteria for MCI. This contrasts with the larger autopsy cohort which had a 52.1% dementia diagnosis, 33.6% cognitively normal, 8.1% mild cognitively impaired, and 6.2% were mildly impaired on cognitive testing but did not meet the criteria for MCI.

CERAD neuritic plaque scores of 0 or 1 were found in 58% of included cases (Table 4). NFT stage had a similar distribution, with B scores of 0 and 1 observed in 49% of the sample (Table 4). More severe stages of arteriolosclerosis and CAA were less common, with moderate or severe stages showing 27% for cerebral arteriolosclerosis, and 16% in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Table 4). Lastly, higher levels of A𝛃 plaque score were commonly seen in this cohort at 24% for a score 2 and 51% for a score of 3.

Biomarkers for Pathological Hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease

We hypothesized that pTau181 would be positively correlated with more severe AD pathology, while Aβ42/40 ratio would be inversely correlated with more severe AD pathology. Additionally, we sought to determine whether there are novel candidate plasma biomarkers that may have relationships with AD pathology.

Consistent with our hypothesis, age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for a 1-unit increase in log-transformed pTau181 (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.81–1.51; p = 0.51) and Aβ42/40 ratio (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.17–1.79; p = 0.32) were positively and inversely correlated with higher Thal Aβ plaque score, respectively (Figure 1A), though the associations were not statistically significant. Tau/Aβ42 ratio (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 0.86–4.19; p = 0.11) was also associated with higher Thal Aβ plaque score (Figure 1A). The age-adjusted OR for GFAP (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.94–3.33; p = 0.08) and IL-6 (OR: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.80–1.94; p = 0.33) showed a positive relationship with Thal Aβ plaque score, while the age-adjusted ORs for VEGF-A (OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.05–1.76; p = 0.02) and PlGF (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91–1.64; p = 0.17 ) were also positively associated with higher Thal Aβ plaque score, with the VEGF-A association having statistical significance (Figure 1A), which was subsequently reduced to non-statistical significance after multiple comparison testing (Adj. p = 0.34, Table 5).

Using a binary logistic regression model, we saw that Braak NFT stage had similar relationships with our tested biomarkers compared to the other AD pathologies: Tau/Aβ42 ratio (OR: 1.39; 95% CI: 0.61–3.15; p = 0.43) and NfLight (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.82–3.25; p = 0.16), were positively associated with Braak NFT stage, while Aβ42/40 ratio (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.12–1.69; p = 0.24) showed an inverse relationship (Figure 1B). Unexpectedly, pTau181 (OR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.62–1.19; p = 0.37) also showed an inverse relationship with Braak NFT stage. GFAP (OR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.71–2.82; p = 0.32), IL-6 (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.83–2.28; p = 0.22), VEGF-A (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.91–1.59; p = 0.20), and PlGF (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.85–1.65; p = 0.32) all had positive age-adjusted associations with Braak NFT stage (Figure 1B).

For neuritic plaques, the age-adjusted OR for pTau181 (OR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.79–1.48; p = 0.62), Tau/Aβ42 ratio (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 0.85–4.52; p = 0.12), and Tau (OR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.04–4.49; p = 0.04) were positively associated with higher (worse) plaque scores, while Aβ42/40 ratio (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.12–1.60; p = 0.21) was inversely associated (Figure 1C). Inflammatory plasma biomarkers GFAP (OR: 2.22; 95% CI: 1.04–4.77; p = 0.04) and IL-6 (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.74–1.89; p = 0.48), and angiogenic plasma biomarkers VEGF-A (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87–1.50; p = 0.33) PlGF (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 0.83–1.53; p = 0.43), had positive associations with more frequent neuritic plaques (Figure 1C).

The magnitudes and directions of the age-adjusted ORs between the biomarkers and ADNC (rather than its individual components) were similar to the individual components (Figure 1D). Tau/Aβ42 ratio (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 0.85–4.01; p = 0.12), NfLight (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 0.96–3.36; p = 0.07), GFAP (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 0.92–3.24; p = 0.09), IL-6 (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.91–2.33; p = 0.11), VEGF-A (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.94–1.56; p = 0.15), and PlGF (OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.91–1.68; p = 0.17) were positively associated with worse ADNC, while Aβ42/40 ratio (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.09–1.04; p = 0.06) was inversely associated (Figure 1D). Sensitivity analyses including additional covariates sex, hypertension, diabetes, and APOEe4 allele did not affect the magnitude or direction of the associations described.

Biomarkers for Pathological Cerebral Small Vessel Disease

We hypothesized that increased levels of VEGF-A and PlGF would correlate with higher levels of cSVD pathology, and we sought to evaluate the relationship between additional angiogenic, inflammatory, and AD-related plasma biomarkers with cSVD pathology.

Our analysis demonstrated that PlGF (OR: 1.35; 95%CI: 1.00–1.82; p &lt; 0.05) had a statistically significant positive age-adjusted association, which was subsequently reduced to non-statistical significance after multiple comparison testing (Adj. p = 0.55, Table 6), while VEGF-A (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.82–1.40; p = 0.61) had a positive association with more severe CAA (Figure 2A). IL-6 (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.81–2.03; p = 0.30) and pTau181 (OR: 1.32; 95% CI: 0.97–1.81; p = 0.08) also had positive associations with more severe CAA (Figure 2A). MMP9 (OR: 0.64; 95%CI: 0.38–1.09; p = 0.10) and Tau/Aβ42 ratio (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.26–1.51; p = 0.29) had inverse associations with CAA severity (Figure 2A).

Contrary to our hypothesis, PlGF (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.60–1.09; p = 0.16) had an inverse association with more severe cerebral arteriolosclerosis, while VEGF-A (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.78–1.28; p = 0.99) had no association. MMP9 (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.47–1.28; p = 0.32), IL-6 (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.43–1.07; p = 0.10), and Tau/Aβ42 ratio (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.33–1.52; p = 0.38) all had an inverse association with more severe cerebral arteriolosclerosis, while Aβ42/40 ratio (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 0.53–5.66; p = 0.36) had a positive association (Figure 2B).

PlGF (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.67–1.22; p = 0.49), VEGF-A (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.60–1.07; p = 0.14), and MMP9 (OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.53–1.65; p = 0.82) all showed an inverse association with more severe chronic cerebrovascular grade, although the magnitude of the relationships was small (Figure 2C). IL-6 (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.25–0.75; p &lt; 0.01) was the only biomarker to show a statistically significant inverse relationship with more severe chronic vascular grade (Figure 2C), which maintained statistical significance after multiple comparison testing (Adj. p = 0.04, Table 6). The largest magnitude of association was observed between Aβ42/40 ratio (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 0.63–7.93; p = 0.22) and worse chronic vascular grade (Figure 2C). Sensitivity analyses did not affect the magnitude or direction of the associations described.

DISCUSSION:

In this study, we evaluated whether plasma-based biomarkers correlated to AD neuropathology at autopsy in 90 participants from the UK-ADRC cohort who had a blood draw within two years prior to death. Additionally, we evaluated how these markers correlated with pathology associated with cSVD. Biomarkers that allow clinicians to diagnose and monitor the level of neuropathology in patients is a crucial step towards identifying at-risk but not yet symptomatic populations, who may be more amenable to potential therapeutics. Currently, studies have shown that plasma pTau181 and Aβ42/40 ratio are highly correlated with amyloid and tau PET measures, with the potential to act as a more cost-effective and accessible yearly screening tool to evaluate the progression of AD21.

As previously reported in the literature23–27, GFAP had a positive association and Aβ42/40 ratio had an inverse association with Braak NFT stage, CERAD neuritic plaque scores, Thal Aβ plaque scores, and combined AD neuropathologic change. While most of our results were not statistically significant, this was not unexpected given our limited sample size. Interestingly, in our sample, Tau/Aβ42 ratio had a positive association with all the AD neuropathologies investigated. In contrast, pTau181 had a smaller magnitude of association with Thal Aβ plaque scores and CERAD neuritic plaque scores, and even had an inverse relationship with Braak NFT stage. Due to the small sample size in analyses using pTau 181, additional studies are required to validate the direction and magnitude of these findings.

A novel finding was the relationships between VEGF-A and PlGF with AD neuropathologies. Our data showed that both VEGF-A and PlGF had positive associations with NFT stage, neuritic plaque score, Aβ plaque score, and ADNC. We hypothesize that the association between VEGF-A and AD neuropathology may be mediated by increased IL-1β as a result of inflammation.34,35 This result suggests further studies are needed to examine the effect of elevated levels of vascular plasma biomarkers on isolated AD pathologies and how this effect is mediated by inflammation.

For cerebrovascular pathologies, our initial hypothesis was that vascular markers such as PlGF and VEGF-A would show a positive association since it is has been shown that these proteins play a major role in the development of new blood vessels, which can occur post vascular injury36–38. While PlGF had a positive association with CAA, it had an inverse association with arteriolosclerosis and chronic vascular grade. VEGF-A had similar results as PlGF, where it had a slightly positive association with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, no association with arteriolosclerosis, and an inverse association with chronic vascular grade. These results suggest new questions regarding the role that these vascular markers play in the development of cerebrovascular pathology in individuals close to death. Two novel markers for cSVD that stood out were Aβ42/40 ratio and IL-6. Aβ42/40 ratio had a strong positive association with cerebral arteriolosclerosis and chronic vascular grade, while IL-6 showed an inverse relationship with cerebral arteriolosclerosis and chronic vascular grade. More studies will have to be conducted to validate these results and understand the mechanism of these two plasma markers as biomarkers of cerebrovascular disease.

This study has some limitations. The sample size led to wide 95% confidence intervals for the age-adjusted odds ratios. While we did observe one statistically significant relationship after multiple comparison testing, many of the relationships we observed would require a larger sample size to demonstrate a statistically significant association, should the association truly exist. The cohort used for this study was a convenience sample comprising a heterogeneous mix of clinical diagnoses and neuropathological classification. While this provided us with a wide range of participants from which we could explore the relationships between neuropathologies and plasma biomarkers, we are not able to isolate the influence one pathology has on the expression of one biomarker. For example, when examining associations between Aβ42/40 ratio and cerebrovascular pathology, we note that those cases also have AD pathology. Cohorts designed specifically to validate biomarker associations with particular pathologies are needed.

While CSF biomarkers of AD pathology have been validated for clinical use, plasma biomarkers still require more studies20,21. This study was one of the first to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the relationships between AD and cerebrovascular pathologies and plasma biomarkers in a community-based cohort. These associations may prove critical in diagnosing and monitoring the progression of AD and cerebrovascular pathologies, by using a widely accessible and inexpensive routine clinical testing tool that can safely be administered to patients.

Research In Context

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using PubMed to evaluate the current state of plasma-based biomarkers for AD and cSVD. Plasma-based biomarkers are not as thoroughly investigated as CSF-based biomarkers. Studies have shown significant associations of plasma-based biomarkers with AD pathology in-vivo, but relationships of plasma-based biomarkers to cSVD and to neuropathology at autopsy are limited.

Interpretation: Our findings support the current literature on the association of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and GFAP with AD pathology and provide evidence for the association between novel angiogenic and inflammatory plasma-based biomarkers and AD and cSVD pathology.

Future directions: Future research should design cohorts to validate the associations of AD-related, inflammatory, and angiogenic plasma-based biomarkers with AD and cSVD pathology. Validation and thorough testing are imperative to translate these biomarkers from the bench to the bedside for use by future clinicians to diagnose and evaluate the disease progression of dementia in patients.

Conflicts of Interest Statement: The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
