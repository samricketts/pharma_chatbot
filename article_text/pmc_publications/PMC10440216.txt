INTRODUCTION:

Little work has compared the effectiveness of using multiple types of memory tests alone or in combination to distinguish dementia severity in diverse research cohorts including Black/African American (AA) and Spanish speakers. Here we evaluate word list and paragraph recall tests to distinguish cognitively normal, MCI and AD in diverse cohorts.

METHODS:

Utilizing Uniform Data Set (UDS) and site-specific supplemental data, logistic regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curves (ROC-AUCs) were used to compare paragraph recall versus word list in differentiating among Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale level.

RESULTS:

Results reveal high discriminability for all groups and no difference between either test in distinguishing between CDR level. Combining tests improved discriminability for the whole group but did not for Black/AAs or Spanish speakers.

DISCUSSION:

Our findings indicate that employing multiple memory tests may not improve differentiation between cognitive impairment levels for diverse cohorts. The burden of added testing may be a barrier for maximizing inclusion of under-represented groups in research.

pmcBACKGROUND

Amnestic deficit, a primary symptom in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is typically the earliest presenting symptom1 and its detection is important for staging disease and monitoring progression. The use of verbal memory assessment tools are sensitive enough to distinguish between normal cognition and various disease stages2–5. The assessment of verbal memory is typically done with tests of word list recall and paragraph recall, both of which require rapid processing of information that must be encoded and consolidated for later recall. One small study examining the relative efficacy of word list recall and paragraph recall6 in disease progression reported that word list maybe more sensitive than paragraph recall earlier on in the disease process, which is a stage of great interest to researchers.

However, studies evaluating race, ethnic and language differences in sensitivity of clinical neuropsychological measures (e.g., list learning memory tasks) have revealed discrepancies in performance between White and African Americans7–9. Differences in performance can weaken the specificity of neuropsychological tests to the extent that cognitively normal African Americans are often misdiagnosed as cognitively impaired10, 11. This has also been well-documented with other ethnic groups in which English is not the participant’s first language, resulting in over-identification of cognitive impairment in ethnic minorities12. These instances highlight the important differences between White and ethnically diverse populations and emphasize that not every cognitive assessment is “one size fits all.” There are continued disparities in the prevalence of dementia, delayed time-to-diagnosis, and associated disease burdens among minority communities in the United States. The potential for misdiagnosis highlights the importance of making research that examines diagnostic accuracy relevant13.

The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD)14 includes the CERAD Word List Memory Task, which has been used in many populations including the oldest old15, rural participants16, diverse patients17, 18, and has been translated into numerous languages other than English19–22. While increasing the number of tests may increase patient burden and cognitive fatigue23 it may provide a more effective way of detecting impairment in diverse populations. The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) at the University of Washington maintains a database of valuable neuropsychological information from the Uniform Data Set (UDS) on participants from all National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) in the United States. Presently, the NACC-UDS includes paragraph recall testing but does not include word list recall testing. As one of the ADCs, the Icahn School of Medicine (ISMMS) Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) collects the NACC-UDS battery. Additionally, ISMMSADRC also collects supplemental neuropsychological data including word list recall testing, making it feasible to compare word list and paragraph recall within the same cohort feasible.

The inclusion of ethnically diverse populations in research is a national priority; however, ethnic level differences have not been considered when developing research testing batteries. Data from the ethnically diverse cohort from ISMMSADRC offer a real possibility to examine whether research batteries are sensitive enough to distinguish between varying levels of disease progression.

Therefore, we evaluate two different neuropsychological assessment measures of memory in ethnically diverse populations to determine differential sensitivity of each or the combination to maximize detection of impairment. The aims of the present paper are to first examine the utility of the CERAD Word List Memory Task, and paragraph recall tests (Craft Story and Logical Memory subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale), alone and in combination, in differentiating normal controls and varying levels of early dementia severity. That is, is word list test better or worse than story recall test in its discriminate ability when the tests are used alone? Does using word list and story tests together provide better discriminate ability than when either test is used alone? Second, do results on discriminate ability differ by race/ethnic group, specifically in Black/African American and Spanish speaking population? Answering these questions has implications for when burden of added testing may be a barrier for increasing inclusion of under-represented population in research,

METHODS

Data Source and Sample Derivation

Data are drawn from the NACC-UDS24 and supplemental testing collected at the ISMMS ADRC from May 2005 to November 2021. All participants provided informed consent. Information regarding recruitment, participant evaluation, and diagnostic criteria for the NACC-UDS are detailed elsewhere25. In brief, a standardized protocol to follow participants at 12- month intervals and provide data for research is provided by NACC and recruitment has been ongoing since 2005. The NACC-UDS and its Spanish translation protocol allow for systematic collection of participant information including demographics and cognitive assessment. There have been multiple versions of the NACC-UDS. The first version of the UDS was available in 2005. The NACC-UDSv2 was in use from 2008 to 2015, following which NACC-UDSv3 was implemented26. NACC-UDSv1 and v2 both utilized WMS-Logical Memory, while NACC-UDSv3 utilized Craft Story.

In addition to the standardized cognitive assessment provided by the NACC-UDS, the ISMMS ADRC employs additional cognitive measures referred to as the “supplemental battery.” The description of these measures are below. Data used in the present study are comprised of baseline data or the data from the first exposure to the supplemental tests of participants who were enrolled at the ISMMS ADRC through 2021.

Measures

List Learning Test

CERAD Word List Memory Task (CWL)14.

The CWL assesses immediate and delayed memory and learning ability of non-associated verbal material. Participants are asked to recall as many of the ten words as possible, immediately after having read them (3 trials; maximum score=30). Following a 15-minute distraction-filled delay, participants are again asked to recall the list, generating a delayed recall score of 0 to 10. This is followed by a recognition trial in which in which the 10 words are mixed with 10 foils for a total recognition score of 0 to 20.

Story Tests

Logical Memory (LM).

The Wechsler Memory Scale Third Edition (WMS-III) – Logical Memory Subtest27 is a measure of verbal narrative memory and is included in the NACC-UDSv2. Participants are presented with two stories and are instructed to recall details of each story after a brief and longer distraction filled delay for a maximum total immediate recall of 53 points and total long delay recall of 39 points. LM includes a recognition task in which the participant answers yes/no questions about the two stories for a maximum total recognition score of 23 points.

Craft Story 21 (CS).

The Craft Story is a measure of verbal narrative memory and is included in the NACC-UDSv3. Participants are presented with a brief story and asked to immediately recall as much as possible from the story and again following a longer delay. Scores are comprised of both verbatim and paraphrase scores.28 The maximum total score for both immediate and delayed recall is 44 for verbatim scoring and 25 for paraphrase scoring.

Outcomes

Dementia severity was measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) which assesses impairment in the areas of memory, orientation, judgement, hobbies, community affairs, and personal care. As one of the goals of this analysis is to examine discrimination in early disease and not when dementia is prominent, this analysis only included CDR scores of 0 (cognitively normal), 0.5 (questionable or mild cognitive impairment), and 1 (mild dementia).

Demographics Characteristics

Demographic characteristics were self-reported and collected utilizing NACC-UDS standardized forms. Characteristics included age, sex, race (White, Black/African American (AA), Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, Asian, and Other), ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic), primary testing language (English, Spanish), and years of education. For the purposes of this evaluation, the race variable was limited to White or Black/AA as sample sizes for other groups were too small to employ comparisons.

Statistical Analysis

Composite score for each memory test was established by using the baseline distribution of mean and standard deviation in CDR=0 group to calculate the Z-score for each individual level of the test (i.e., immediate, delay, and recognition [when available]) and then taking the average of the Z-scores. We explored using verbatim and paraphrase CS score but found no differences in results. An average of verbatim and paraphrase CS score was therefore created before constructing its Z-score.

Because the CDR global score is an ordered categorical variable, we considered using ordered logistic regression models to distinguish CDR 0 versus 0.5 versus 1 simultaneously as an alternative modeling method. Statistically, ordered logistic regression models are more efficient than multiple, separate logistic regression models. From a clinical perspective however, the more relevant question is to distinguish whether a patient is CDR 0 versus 0.5, or CDR 0.5 versus 1. This may be particularly important in the current study as previous studies showed that the ability to differentiating CDR 0 versus 0.5 and CDR 0.5 versus 1 may differ by race/ethnic groups and also by the specific memory test that is used. For example, Dodge et al showed that it was easier to differentiate CDR 0 versus 0.5 in white participants than Black/AA participants in memory, but it was also easier to differentiate CDR 0.5 versus 1 among Black/AA than white participants in other cognitive domains.29 We explored estimating ordered logistic regression models but found that the underlying proportional odds assumptions were violated by at least some of independent variables in all models (Results available upon request). Two logistic regression models were therefore employed for each individual test alone and using both word list and story recall tests to distinguish CDR 0 versus 0.5 and CDR 0.5 versus 1, respectively. Only models using the full sample were adjusted for age, sex, years of education, and race/ethnic group. Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under the Curves (ROC-AUCs) were examined as an indicator for overall goodness of fit of the logistic model differentiating CDR groups and word list and story memory tests alone and combined. We tested the equality of ROC areas obtained from applying different tests to the same sample using the roccomp procedure in Stata.30 Subgroup analyses by race and testing language were conducted. Race subsample analysis was limited to White and Black/AA participants, regardless of testing language, because other racial ethnic groups did not have sufficient sample size. Testing language subsample analysis examined English and Spanish language testing. All analyses were conducted using Stata 16.0.31 Due to the exploratory nature of this analysis, statistical significance level was defined as p&lt;0.05 a priori without corrections for multiple comparisons. Finally, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value analyses were conducted for each model differentiating CDR groups and word list and story memory tests alone and combined.

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics

The sample consisted of baseline assessments of 1,536 participants who had completed a UDSv1 (n=295), UDSv2 (n=781) or UDSv3 (n=460) assessment. Of these, 137 participants with a listed ethnicity of “Other” were excluded because the sample size was too small for between ethnic group comparisons. One participant was excluded for having testing conducted in Chinese (and therefore too small a sample size to employ ethnic group comparisons). 79 participants were excluded for having a CDR&gt;1. The analytic sample therefore includes 1,319 participants who self-identified as either White, Black/AA, or Hispanic; tested in English or Spanish; and had a CDR of either 0, 0.5, or 1. Demographic characteristics are available in Table 1. Average age was 75, 52% male, white (60%), and English speaking (89%), with an average education of 14 years. The mean raw scores of all tests by whole sample and subgroup are in Table 2.

Distinguishing CDR 0 versus 0.5

Results from comparing individual tests

Table 3 shows ROC-AUC values for using word list and story recall test alone and together for the full sample, by race and testing language subgroups in discriminating between levels of CDR. We also report sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for each model (Table 4). Because inferences did not change, we focus on reporting our summary of results from ROC-AUC analyses. In the full sample, discriminability was high ranging from AUC=0.79 to 0.84, and there was no statistically significant difference in discriminative ability between word list and paragraph recall in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 (AUC=0.83 for CWL, AUC=0.84 for LM; p=0.59) (AUC=0.81 for CWL, AUC=0.79 for CS; p=0.56).

This same pattern of high discriminability and no difference among memory test type was observed among Blacks/AAs (AUC=0.81 for CWL, AUC=0.89 for LM; p=0.07) (AUC=0.80 for CWL, AUC=0.81 for CS; p=0.93), Whites (AUC=0.85 for CWL, AUC=0.82 for LM; p=0.22) (AUC=0.80 for CWL, AUC=.82 for CS; p=0.58), participants tested in Spanish (AUC=0.84 for CWL, AUC=0.74 for LM; p=0.15), and participants tested in English (AUC=.85 for CWL, AUC=.84 for LM; p=0.92) (AUC=.79 for CWL, AUC=.81 for CS; p=0.54). For Spanish testing, the sample was too small to perform CS comparisons.

Results from comparing combined tests and individual tests alone

In the full sample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 when combining CWL and LM (CWL+LM) compared to either test alone (AUC=0.87 for CWL+LM vs. AUC=0.84 for CWL alone; p=0.001; AUC=0.87 for CWL+LM vs. AUC=0.84 for LM alone; p&lt;0.001). This same pattern was observed when comparing CWL and CS combined (CWL+ CS) versus CWL alone (AUC=0.87 for CWL+ CS vs. AUC=0.82 for CWL alone; p&lt;0.01) and versus CS alone (AUC=0.86 for CWL+ CS vs. AUC=0.83 for CS alone; p=0.007).

In the Black/AA subsample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 when combining CWL+CS versus each test alone (AUC=0.91 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.80 for CWL alone, AUC=0.81 for CS alone; both p&lt;0.05). However, combining CWL+LM provided better discriminative ability over CWL (AUC=0.91 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.81 for CWL alone; p=0.01) but did not provide improved discriminative ability over LM alone (AUC=0.91 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.89 for LM alone; p=0.11).

In the White subsample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 when combining CWL+LM together versus each test alone (AUC=.88 for CWL+LM, AUC=.84 for CWL alone, AUC=0.82 for LM alone; both p&lt;0.05). However, combining CWL+CS provide improved discriminative ability over CWL alone (AUC=0.86 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.80 for CWL alone; p=0.01) but did not provide improved discriminative ability over CS alone (AUC=0.86 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.82 for CS alone; p=0.07).

In the Spanish testing language subsample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 when combining CWL+LM versus LM alone (AUC=0.86 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.74 for LM alone; p=0.025), but there was no benefit to discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 by combining the two tests versus CWL alone (AUC=0.86 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.84 for CWL alone; p=0.43).

In the English testing language subsample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0 versus 0.5 when combining CWL+LM versus either test alone (AUC=0.88 CWL+LM, AUC=0.85 for CWL alone, AUC=0.84 for LM alone; both p&lt;0.01). This same pattern was observed when combining CWL+CS versus either test alone (AUC=0.86 CWL+CS, AUC=0.79 for CWL alone, AUC=0.81 for CS alone; both p&lt;0.01).

Distinguishing CDR 0.5 versus 1

Results from individual tests

In the full sample, discriminability was also high ranging from AUC=0.82 to 0.86. There was no statistically significant difference in discriminative ability between CWL and either paragraph recall test in distinguishing between CDR 0.5 versus 1.0 (AUC=0.86 for CWL, AUC=0.82 for LM; p=0.113) (AUC=0.81 for CWL, AUC=0.84 for CS; p=656).

This same pattern of high discriminability and no difference among memory type was observed among Blacks/AAs (AUC=0.87 for CWL, AUC=0.83 for LM; p=0.161), Whites (AUC=0.87 for CWL, AUC=0.83 for LM; p=0.160) (AUC=0.81 for CWL, AUC=0.83 for CS; p=0.824), participants tested in Spanish (AUC=0.85 for CWL, AUC=0.85 for LM; p=0.95), and participants tested in English (AUC=0.87 for CWL, AUC=0.83 for LM; p0.08) (AUC=0.81 for CWL, AUC=0.83 for CS; p=0.746). For both the Black/AA and Spanish testing subsamples, the sample was too small to employ Craft Story comparisons.

Results from using combined tests

In the full sample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0.5 versus 1 when combining CWL+LM versus CWL alone (AUC=0.88 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.86 for CWL alone; p=0.02) and when combining CWL+LM versus LM alone (AUC=0.88 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.82 for LM alone; p&lt;0.001). This same pattern was observed between CWL+CS, versus CWL alone (AUC=0.93 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.81 for CWL alone; p&lt;0.01) and CWL+CS, versus CS alone (AUC=0.93 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.84 for CS alone; p=0.009).

In the Black/AA subsample, combining CWL+LM provided significantly better discriminability than LM alone (AUC=0.93 for CWL+LM versus AUC=0.83 for LM alone; p=0.029), but the combination was not better than CWL alone (AUC=0.93 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.87 for CWL alone; p=0.161).

In the White subsample, combining CWL+LM provided significantly better discriminability than LM alone (AUC=0.89 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.83 for LM alone; p&lt;0.01), but the combination was not better than CWL alone (AUC=0.89 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.87 for CWL alone; p &gt; 0.05). Combining CWL+CS provided better discriminability than CWL alone (AUC=0.95 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.81 for CWL alone; p=0.006); however, the combination was not better than CS alone (AUC=0.94 for CWL+CS, AUC=0.83 for CS alone; p=0.056).

In the Spanish testing language subsample, there was no statistically significant benefit to discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0.5 versus 1 for the combined scores (AUC=0.90 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.85 for CWL alone; p=0.369 and AUC=0.90 for CWL+LM, AUC=0.85 for LM alone; p=0.246).

In the English testing language subsample, there was better discriminative ability in distinguishing between CDR 0.5 versus 1 when combining CWL+LM versus CWL alone (AUC=0.89 for CWL+LM versus AUC=0.87 for CWL alone; p=0.048) and when combining CWL+LM versus LM alone (AUC=0.89 for CWL+LM versus AUC=0.82 for LM alone; p&lt;0.001). This same pattern was observed between CWL+CS, versus CWL alone (AUC=0.92 for CWL+CS versus AUC=0.81 for CWL alone; p=0.037) and CWL+CS, versus CS alone (AUC=0.92 for CWL+CS versus AUC=0.83 for CS alone; p=0.009).

DISCUSSION

This study examined the utility of differentiating cognitive performance among levels of dementia severity for a Word List Memory Task (CWL), and paragraph recall tests (CS and LM) amongst ethnically diverse participants enrolled in the ISMMS ADRC. There were several important findings.

First, consistent with prior research, there was high discriminability of dementia stage overall for all tests32 (i.e., AUC &gt;.80) in all groups and in general the AUC in most comparisons was numerically highest for the LM (which is no longer part of the UDS), except among Spanish speakers. Combining tests yielded better discriminability for the overall group compared to using either test alone, but this was not the case in the Black/AA or the White cohort where one of the tests was better than or not different than both tests combined. This trend was also observed when examining sensitivity and specificity analyses.

Second, consistent with prior research7, 10, 11, there were discrepancies observed between Black/AA and White subjects. While not analyzed specifically, Black/AA absolute value scores were lower than White participants, putting them at greater risk to be categorized as impaired; however, additional analyses with larger sample sizes would need to be used to assess differences between groups and draw any formal conclusions.

In Spanish speaking sample, where AUC scores were generally lower than the other groups for each test, there was added benefit of using both word list and story recall tests to distinguish between normal (CDR=0) versus mild cognitive impairment (CDR=0.5). These findings highlight the importance of not utilizing a “one size fits all” with regard to testing strategy. The added burden of utilizing two tests over one should be considered when assessing participants who are neither White nor native English speakers.

There has been dedicated research about race and culture and their effects on determining cognitive performance on ethnically diverse older adults12, 33–36. This literature emphasizes the notion that cognitive assessments are susceptible to cultural differences between ethnically diverse participants when compared to White participants. It is therefore possible that cultural influences could lead to the discrepancies we observed when distinguishing cognitive performance among levels of dementia severity. As the dataset does not include measurement or characterization of participant cultural background, more work needs to be done to fully understand the nature of the relationship between what specific cultural variables influence cognitive performance.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, many normative studies have been conducted on the memory tests examined in the current study.37–41 However, norms differ depending on the sample assessed; Norms also change over time. Comparison of our cohort to these studies showed them unlikely to be applicable to our largely urban, highly diverse cohort of participants. Even though ISMMS contributes data to the NACCUSD, test scores in our sample were lower than overall NACCUDS means that were reported.37–40 Instead of using disparate normative datasets for each memory test with different cohorts derived at different moments in time, we have used in sample statistics to generate z-scores, which may limit the generalizability of our results. The decision to combine immediate and delayed recall scores to create composite scores is a method previously utilized; however, it is important to acknowledge that utilizing alternative approaches (such as different summary metrics or memory measures) could yield different results. Future work should examine various methodology to confirm the present findings. Secondly, we have used the CDR as the categorical variable, assuming it identifies normal, MCI, and mild dementia and while in fact there is a very high correlation of CDR with these diagnostic categories, there may be differences in disease etiology and co-morbid conditions. Additionally, the sample size of Blacks/AAs and Spanish speaking participants was small in UDSv3 (where the CS was available) so comparisons with word list tests were not possible. Future study of a larger cohort examining CS may be warranted, to investigate the validity of our findings. Additionally, our cohort was recruited from New York City, and while diverse, results may not be generalizable to older adults in other states.

Conclusions

To conclude, our findings establish the ability of both word list and paragraph recall memory tests to differentiate between varying levels of CDR and for the combination to provide added discriminability. However, the benefit of combining multiple tests is not apparent across Black/AA and Spanish speaking participants who may be particularly burdened by extra testing time. Researchers developing future test batteries may want to consider this when assessing the cognition of diverse participants.

Research in Context

Systematic Review: Literature was reviewed using traditional sources (e.g., PubMed, etc.). As few known studies have examined the use of word list and paragraph recall memory tests both alone and in combination in diverse research cohorts, a review of the literature describing racial, ethnic, and language level differences in the sensitivity of clinical neuropsychological measures was used to inform hypotheses in the current study.

Interpretation: Our findings suggest that the use of multiple memory tests to differentiate between levels of dementia severity is not commensurate across White, Black/African American, and Spanish speaking participants.

Future directions: This study takes an important first step in understanding racial/ethnic/and primary language differences in cognitive testing performed in research. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate the relationship between what specific cultural variables influence cognitive performance in these groups.
