Background:

Dementia and urinary incontinence (UI) are etiologically complex clinical syndromes. Dementia and UI often occur in the same individuals, but underlying factors connecting them are incompletely understood.

Objective:

Query data from a community-based autopsy series to assess pathologies that underlie UI.

Methods:

Included research subjects came to autopsy from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort. A total of 368 research volunteers met inclusion criteria for this cross-sectional study. The average age at death was 85.3 years and the average number of annual clinic visits was 5.2 visits. Statistical models were run to evaluate which pathologies were associated with UI. Data included pathologies scored according to conventional stage-based systems, and these studies were complemented by quantitative digital neuropathology.

Results:

Dementia was diagnosed at the final clinical visit in 208 (56.7% of the sample) and UI was documented in 156 (42.7%). UI was associated with depression and dementia (both P&lt;0.001). More women than men had a history of UI (P&lt;0.04), and women with UI had had more biological children than those without UI (P&lt;0.005). Participants with limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) were more likely to have UI than those without LATE-NC (P&lt;0.001). The presence of LATE-NC (Stage &gt;1) was associated with UI with or without severe Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) and/or Lewy body (LB) pathology.

Conclusions:

In this community-based autopsy cohort, multiple factors were associated with UI, but the neuropathologic change most robustly associated with UI was LATE-NC.

Urinary incontinence (UI) is defined as “the complaint of any involuntary leakage of urine” [1]. A common and troublesome symptom [2-4], UI has been associated with many comorbidities and exacerbating factors [5-7]. For example, those affected by UI also are at increased risk for depression [8, 9]. Older adults are most often affected: UI has been reported in ~1/3rd of women age &gt;80 years, ~20% of older men, and 60-80% of nursing home residents [4-6, 10, 11]. Amnestic dementia--also termed “Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-type dementia” [12, 13]--frequently coexists with UI [8, 14].

Dementia, like UI, is a prevalent clinical syndrome with multiple causes. Neuropathologies associated with dementia include AD neuropathologic change (ADNC), limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC), Lewy body pathologies (LBP) and cerebrovascular diseases [15-17]. Moreover, pathology subtypes in the same brain is the rule and not the exception in persons dying beyond age 85 years [12, 18-20]. Together, the non-ADNC pathologies accounted for &gt;50% of AD-type dementia risk in a large community-based cohort [21]. Recently described neuropathologies, e.g. aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG)[22, 23], are also commonly seen in late-life brain autopsies, but for ARTAG the clinical-pathologic correlation with cognition is less well understood.

What is known about UI in dementia? Multiple prior studies reported that the proportion of individuals with UI increased in parallel with cognitive impairment severity [6, 24-26]. A study of community-dwelling individuals found that UI proximate to death was not associated with ADNC, LATE-NC, or several cerebrovascular disease pathologies [27]. Instead, UI was associated with incident parkinsonism and Lewy body pathology [27]. Other studies also found that patients with Lewy body diseases were relatively likely to have UI [28-33]. Additional neuropathologies, like argyrophilic grain disease, also have been associated UI [34].

There is a relative paucity of recent research on the relationship between UI and neuropathology, specifically with regard to whether specific subtypes and combinations of dementia-related pathology are relatively more likely to associate with UI. Conversely, since not all persons with dementia have UI, there may be protective factors or conditions.

To better understand the pathogenetic implications of late-life UI with or without cognitive impairment, we analyzed data from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (UK-ADRC) autopsy cohort [35]. Most of the research volunteers in this study were recruited while cognitively normal, and were evaluated at yearly longitudinal visits – often for many years – prior to autopsy. Here, we assessed whether UI was associated with dementia, obstetric history, and/or depression. Then we tested which (if any) dementia-linked pathologies were associated with UI proximate to death.

Materials and methods

Research participants were recruited into the UK-ADRC community-based cohort, which has been described in detail [35, 36]. Briefly, adult volunteers (most age 70 years and above) agreed to be followed annually for cognitive, physical, and neurological examination and to donate their brain after death. Protocols and informed consent procedures were approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board. Certain exclusion criteria were applied at recruitment--including parkinsonism, substance use disorder history, and severe neuropsychiatric disorder (e.g. major depressive or bipolar disorders) [35, 36]. However, symptoms such as parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently developed while on study.

Beginning in 2005, participants were asked a series of questions at each annual clinic visit about their health history, as a part of the Uniform Data Set [37]. Specifically, we used Health History Form A5 (https://files.alz.washington.edu/documentation/uds3-ivp-a5.pdf), which is a standardized data collection protocol used by all NIA-funded ADRCs. Late-life UI was determined if the final clinical UDS A5 examination had Incontinence, Urinary – “Recent/Active”, meaning UI was present or its symptoms managed with medication within the last year. Depression is noted on the same form as “Active depression in the past 2 years (Yes/No)”. The number of biological children for each participant was obtained from the UDS Family History Form A3 (https://files.alz.washington.edu/documentation/uds3-fvp-a3.pdf). Participants and their study partners also were administered the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [38], and participants also completed Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [39] assessments at each visit.

Neuropathologic methods used at the UK-ADRC have been described before [40-42]. Briefly, immunohistochemical stains for phosphorylated tau (PHF-1, a gift from Dr. Peter Davies; 1:500 dilution), phospho-TDP-43 (1D3 clone, BioLegend Inc, USA; 1:500 dilution), and Aβ (Nab228 monoclonal antibody from Fisher Scientific, USA; 1:1000 dilution) were used. For staging of ADNC, LATE-NC, and LBD neuropathologies, the respective consensus guidelines were applied [15-17].

For the present study, only brains that were worked up for ADNC, LBD, and TDP-43 pathology were included; these evaluations began systematically in 2012. For analysis, neuropathologic variables were operationalized as follows: Braak NFT was dichotomized as stages 0-IV vs. V-VI; LATE-NC was stage 2/3 vs stage 0/1; and LBD was considered present if any non-amygdala Lewy bodies were present. These operationalizations were selected because they reflect the stages of pathology linked to cognitive impairment. Cerebrovascular pathologies were diagnosed at autopsy in accordance with the NACC Neuropathology Data Set [43] rubrics: https://naccdata.org/data-collection/forms-documentation/np-10. A relatively small subset of cases was included in the autopsy cohort due to referral from a dementia clinic. We excluded individuals with rare conditions recruited from a memory disorders clinic: frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD, including progressive supranuclear palsy), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and triplet repeat disorders were thus removed (Supplemental Table 1).

For digital quantification of ADNC in multiple brain regions, immunostained slides were loaded into an Aperio (now Leica) ScanScope slide scanner. Slides were scanned at 40x magnification, the data were stored on a dedicated server, and analyses were performed as previously described in detail [40, 44]. Sections were analyzed from the following left hemisphere neocortical regions: middle frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 9), superior and middle temporal gyri (Brodmann areas 21 and 22), inferior parietal lobule (Brodmann areas 39 and 40), and occipital lobe including the primary visual area (Brodmann areas 17 and 18). The workflow for digital neuropathologic analyses were as stated previously [40, 44]. Briefly, whole slide analysis was impractical because it was overly time consuming and severely biased by differential distribution of gray/white matter in different cases. To enable a more focused analysis that could be reproducible between users, a square analysis region (4 mm2) was created (Supplemental Figure 1). For each case, that box was placed within the gray matter at the site of highest concentration of pathologic findings. Subsequent boxes were then placed as far from the existing boxes as possible without overlapping other analysis regions. Areas of poor stain quality were avoided. To minimize analysis alterations caused by portions of folded tissue or foreign material, these were eliminated from the analysis boxes with the negative pen tool. In the amyloid analyses, meningeal vessels were also excluded by the negative pen tool.

For both the Aβ and pTau digital quantification analyses, measurements of lesion burden were generated representing densities of amyloid plaques and tau-immunoreactive NFTs that were detected. Batch normalization was not performed. The methodologies, algorithm inputs, and thresholding parameters were applied as previously reported in detail [40, 44]. Briefly, for digital evaluations of Aβ and pTau burden, the Aperio Image Analysis Toolbox Positive Pixel Count (PPC), version 9.1, was used. The PPC algorithm was run on ten 4-mm2 boxes selected on gray matter portions from each slide for both Aβ and pTau proteinopathy (Supplemental Methods file shows algorithm inputs for both amyloid plaque and NFT densities). These quantitative ADNC severity data are routinely obtained for each autopsy and the data stored by the UK-ADRC Data Management Core.

In 2018, UK-ADRC began working up brains for ARTAG. Thus, in a subsample of included participants for whom ARTAG data were available, we examined the association between UI and amygdala ARTAG. An ad hoc system was used to score ARTAG separately in the white matter (WM), periventricular region (PV), and subpial (SP) region of each amygdala section stained with the PHF-1 (phospho-tau) antibody. ARTAG pathology was scored by a rater blind to the participant’s clinical and other neuropathological data, and the three subtypes of amygdala ARTAG (WM, PV, and SP) were scored on a 0-4 severity scale: 0=none; 1=very seldom pTau ARTAG profiles; 2=moderately severe pTau ARTAG profiles (up to 5 per high-power microscopic field [hpf]); 3= severe pTau ARTAG profiles with 5-10 detected per hpf; and 4=very severe pTau ARTAG profiles with &gt;10 detected per hpf.

Statistical analyses:

Unadjusted comparisons between participants with and without UI were performed using Welch’s t tests and chi-squared statistics. To estimate the association between UI and the variables of interest, we employed a case-control design, where participants with UI were the cases. UI was the dependent variable in logistic regression models that included age at death, sex, Braak stage, LATE-NC stage, LBD indicator, and (in some models) number of biological children. Given the plausible effect of biological sex on the background risk of UI (particularly related to LBD pathology), we also assessed sex as an effect measure modifier, where cross-product terms for sex and each pathology variable were investigated in separate post hoc models. The logistic regressions were fit to the data using the glm package in R [45, 46]. In an exploratory analysis, the digital pathology data (cases with UI versus controls) were compared using Welch’s t-tests (default t-tests in R package) in all the brain regions of interest normally sampled.

Results

Participant demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. A total of 368 autopsied volunteers met all inclusion and exclusion criteria; they were predominantly White and highly educated, with an average age at death of 85.3 years, 56.7% were diagnosed with dementia prior to death, and ~40% had an APOE ε4 allele. About 25% of included participants were cognitively normal in the final evaluation prior to death in this community-based sample.

Summary data about the neuropathologies are depicted in Table 2. Almost 40% had High ADNC (Braak NFT Stages V or VI), over 1/3rd had any LBD pathology, and almost 1/3rd had LATE-NC Stage &gt;1. Cerebrovascular pathologies were also quite frequent, and these were parsed as infarcts (large or lacunar), arteriolosclerosis, or cerebral amyloid amyloidosis (Table 2).

UI was a common symptom among included participants (Table 3): 42.7% reported UI at their final clinic visit. Based on the available data, approximately 90% of the UI cases were incident, i.e. developed during longitudinal follow-up but were negative at baseline examination. UI was associated with impaired global cognition (MMSE scores), clinical dementia (CDR scores), and depression (Table 4 and Figure 1); P&lt;0.001 for each of these tests. Women had a higher likelihood of reporting UI (P&lt;0.04). Moreover, women with UI tended to have had more biological children than women without UI (Table 5), and having more biological children was associated with greater risk of UI in females but not males (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).

To test whether specific subtypes of pathology were associated with UI, a logistic regression model was run that included Braak NFT stages [47], LBD (dichotomous), LATE-NC stage &gt;1 (dichotomous), and in the model we also included age and sex (Table 6). According to this model, LATE-NC was associated with UI (P&lt;0.001); odds ratio was 2.29, 95% confidence interval was (1.4-3.7). This association was also evident in a sensitivity analysis when LATE-NC was operationalized to include stage 1 (Supplemental Table 4). There was no evidence that sex modified the association between LATE-NC and UI, nor ADNC and UI (Supplemental Tables 5 and 6). However, there was a statistically significant interaction between LBD and sex (P=0.007) such that men with LBD were more likely to have UI than women with LBD (Table 7).

Post hoc analyses were performed, using different approaches to assess associations between UI and various neuropathologies. Because UI was strongly associated with cognitive status (Figure 1), we evaluated the percent frequencies of UI stratified by both presence/absence of prevalent neurodegenerative pathologies (ADNC, LATE-NC, and LBD), and by the presence/absence of clinical dementia (final CDR scores less than 1 versus CDR scores ≥1; Figure 2). In this analysis, LATE-NC showed a marginally significant (P&gt;0.05) tendency to be comorbid with UI regardless of dementia status (P=.18 with CDR&lt;=1, P=0.078 with CDR&gt;1), whereas ADNC and LBD were not consistently associated with UI (Figure 2).

Since prior studies have indicated that UI is associated with LBD pathologies [28-33], we performed multiple sensitivity analyses to ascertain whether subtypes or subsets of LBD cases were associated with UI. We considered it likely that sexual dimorphism could be an important confounder since UI is more common in females and LBD more common in males [48, 49]. Compatible with that hypothesis, a regression analysis found strong interaction between sex and LBD (Table 7). In men, LBD was more likely to be associated with UI (P=0.007). Further, we tested whether LBD was associated with UI when logistical regression models were applied with LBD pathology operationalized as subcortical only or neocortical only LBD pathology (Supplemental Tables 7 and 8). Neither of these sensitivity analyses indicated that a subset of LBD pathology was associated with UI in these participants. In an analysis that stratified neuropathologies to include combinations (LATE-NC + LBs, etc.), the presence of LATE-NC was consistently associated with UI whether or not combined with other pathologies, including the quadruple-misfolded protein phenotype [50] with ADNC, LATE-NC, and LB pathologies (Table 8).

As ADNC is a major neuropathologic substrate of dementia, but the conventional “stage-based” ordinal metrics of ADNC severity may be suboptimal for quantitative comparisons (and we had not previously included an analysis related to amyloid plaques in the present study), we performed an analysis of the associations between UI and quantitative ADNC severity. Here we used assessments of Aβ and pTau pathologic burden, i.e. the proportion of the slide immunostained for Aβ or pTau, in multiple brain regions (Figure 3). Via these metrics, average ADNC severity in cases with UI was higher, and the pathology was nominally statistically significant at P&lt;0.05 in several brain regions; only the frontal lobe had both more Aβ plaques and more NFTs in UI versus non-UI cases (Figure 4). All of the nominal P-values for all the t-tests are shown in Supplemental Table 9. Whereas the nominally significant differences were all in the same direction (cases with more ADNC were more likely to have had UI), none of the individual comparisons were statistically significant at P&lt;0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons.

We also evaluated whether there were associations between UI and pathologies other than LATE-NC, ADNC, or LBD. Results of tests for association between UI and CVD pathologies are shown in Table 9. There was not an association detected between UI and any of the CVD pathologies. In a subset of n=120 individuals (all of whom died after 2017), we assessed whether the presence of amygdala ARTAG was associated with UI at last clinic visit (Table 10). In this subsample, the association was still robust between LATE-NC and UI (P&lt;0.01), but we detected no association between UI and ARTAG in subpial, periventricular, or white matter regions.

Discussion

In the UK-ADRC autopsy cohort, participants with dementia were far more likely to have UI than those who died without cognitive impairment, agreeing with prior studies [6, 24-26]. In this community-based longitudinal sample we also confirmed that UI was associated with depression and tended to be more common in females than males. The neuropathologic feature most strongly associated with UI was LATE-NC. There were also weaker tendencies (not necessarily statistically significant) for UI to be associated with other pathologies including ADNC and LBD.

UI is a complex trait and multiple influences may contribute to the clinical syndrome, including urologic, infectious, gastrointestinal, obstetric, and/or neurological factors [2, 3, 5, 11, 25]. UI in dementia may reflect a mixture of autonomic nervous system dysfunction along with other medical (infections, drugs, obstetrics history, hip fractures, stroke, etc.) etiologies. Moreover, primary cognitive and memory problems – basic challenges with remembering the “where/what/why/how” of toilet use – may often be relevant[2].

There was substantial agreement between our findings and prior work from other investigators. For example, people with UI were relatively likely to also self-report depression. The relationship between UI and depression is complex as the two symptoms may each influence each other and/or be exacerbated by common underlying factors. The syndromic combination has a large public health impact and has been discussed in prior work by other investigators [4, 8, 9, 14]. In the present study, females were more likely than males to have UI. Prior studies also reported this phenomenon and the tendency for females to be susceptible to UI may relate to obstetric and gynecological histories [2, 3, 5, 11]. Compatible with this hypothesis, women in the present study with UI had more biological children than those without UI. Within the age-range evaluated, there was not a tendency for older persons to be more affected by UI (agreeing with prior work [27]), possibly because the association with dementia status was a more dominant influence in this age range (~70-100 years at death).

An unexpected result was the lack of robust association detected between UI and LBD pathology. This is contrary to prior studies that found that UI was associated with LBDs including Parkinson disease (PD), PD dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple systems atrophy (MSA) [28-33]. The connection between UI and LBDs is highly credible because urinary function is strongly affected by the autonomic nervous system, and, relevant nuclei of the brain and brainstem are vulnerable to LBD pathology [51, 52]. However, when looking at the participants overall we found no association between LBDs and UI, although almost 40% of participants had autopsy-confirmed LBD and we performed several sensitivity analyses to test whether UI was associated with LBD after re-parsing of the data. There are possible explanations for these negative findings. First, most of the research volunteers had normal neurologic function on initial entry into the UK-ADRC longitudinal cohort [35]. The age of recruitment was typically ~70 years. Many participants developed incident parkinsonism symptoms and/or autopsy-confirmed α-synucleinopathy [53-55], but “Pure” PD, PDD, or DLB (lacking ADNC) are relatively uncommon, and MSA almost non-existent. These factors in combination lowered the sample size of “pure” LBDs and probably influenced our results. Further, the included subjects were &gt;55% female whereas pure LBP tends to target men [48, 49]. Accordingly, men with LBD pathology were more likely have UI.

In comparison to pathologies that are associated with clinical parkinsonism, the UK-ADRC study design is more well-powered for studying the common amnestic dementia-related pathologies – ADNC, LATE-NC, and CVD pathologies. More specifically, 56.7% of the study sample had amnestic dementia before death. The subtype of pathology that was most strongly associated with UI in this study was LATE-NC. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report this phenomenon. We could find no confounder that explained a spurious association in this sample – not age, sex, comorbid ADNC, or other factors. As the acronym suggests, LATE-NC preferentially affects limbic structures in the brain (particularly the amygdala), and in severe cases can affect the frontal lobe. Intriguingly, Sugimoto et al found that frontal lobe dysfunction (as operationalized with the Frontal Assessment Battery) in AD-type (amnestic) dementia was associated with UI [56]. It is theoretically possible that LATE-NC helps to explain that observation. We note that relatively few studies have evaluated the associations between UI and frontal temporal dementia (FTD) clinically or FTLD pathologically. Diehl-Schmid et al reported that parkinsonism was relatively common but UI only affected 26% of FTD patients in that series [57]. Perneczky et al reported that 8/44 (18%) of FTLD cases had UI [58]. We do not know of a case series with FTLD-TDP that has reported UI as a conspicuous clinical feature.

A clinical syndrome that has previously been associated strongly with UI and dementia is normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). More specifically, NPH is characterized clinically by a triad of symptoms including UI, cognitive impairment, and gait instability. A subset of cases at the UK-ADRC had NPH diagnosed clinically (n=13 cases), and, with the strong caveat of small sample size, there was an association with UI but not with any other specific neurodegenerative-type pathology (see Supplemental Table 10). It is possible that more systematic prospective CSF pressure measurements would have provided an alternative set of findings.

Strengths of this study included a well-characterized sample with long clinical follow-up – participants averaged &gt;5yrs on study with yearly clinic visits before coming to autopsy, with most subjects followed from a normal cognitive status and lacking UI at baseline. Detailed neuropathological assessments were generated that included data on a range of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies. A relatively rich repository of additional data included some details of cognitive status and obstetric history. These enabled a relatively robust analysis of relevant parameters to enable an unexpected connection-point between UI and dementia.

The present study also had limitations. The study sample was predominantly highly educated Whites, which limits generalizability to other populations. Four main types of UI are recognized clinically, based partly on causative factors: Stress incontinence, overactive bladder, overflow incontinence, and mixed incontinence [6, 7]. However, we do not have direct access to a detailed description of the subtypes (or the severity) of UI that were experienced by the research participants in this study. We also had incomplete information about when the UI started, for some cases. Knowing these details could have enabled a deeper understanding of the physiological implications of the links between dementia subtypes and UI. Other potential confounders were not assessed including medications to treat urinary incontinence, as well as other medications and comorbid conditions.

Although each pathology exists across a range of gradation, we here applied dichotomous variables to represent co-pathologies, for the purpose of most of our statistical tests. The reason for this approach is that the semiquantitative scoring rubrics are highly non-linear in clinical-pathological correlation, and inexactly correlated (in terms of the ordinal variables) with each other. We also used digital pathology which has certain weaknesses as well (e.g., batch artifacts, dirt/debris on slide, background staining and thresholding), although we sought to minimize them in practice. For example, all slides were meticulously cleaned before scanning. In the future we may be able to combine more quantitative metrics for many different pathologies, and to generate new statistical tools to assess the various parameters (and their combinations) comparatively. Furthermore, future studies could further elucidate the interrelationship between UI and dementia in the context of other comorbid conditions and the potential impact of various pharmacotherapies.

We conclude that there was a robust association detected between UI and LATE-NC, whereas the associations between UI and other dementia-linked pathologies were tenuous. The tendencies for particular symptoms to herald subtypes of pathology may be useful information. With new drugs tailored to specific pathologies, a new era may be imminent with dementia prevention therapies that are effective for a subset of at-risk individuals [59, 60]. Thus, there may be increased attention on how clinical features predict pathology, with implications about patients’ prognosis and, possibly, their responses to therapies.

In these analyses, neuropathologic features were dichotomized: LATE-NC Stages 0/1 vs 2/3 (A); Braak NFT stages 0-IV vs V/VI (B); and, neocortical Lewy bodies absent vs present (C). With the smaller sample sizes in each group, none of these comparisons were statistically significant using two-tailed Student t-tests.

These methods were described in detail previously[44]. Digital analysis of Aβ amyloid plaques returned values of density per square millimeter via a modified nuclear algorithm. The raw immunohistochemical (IHC) results are shown in B and following analyses (C), amyloid plaques are false-colored yellow, orange, and red to convey the digital detection of individual amyloid plaques for quantitation purposes. Representative digital quantification of tau pathologies are depicted in (A). Analyses were performed on PHF-1immunostained sections (D). After using the crafted Genie NFT/NP algorithm to isolate the NFTs, the NFT density (NFTs per square millimeter) was determined by a modified nuclear algorithm, with NFTs here stained yellow (E). The same pTau-immunoreactive NFT recognized by the algorithm is indicated by a blue arrow in both D and E. Scale bar = 100 microns for B, C, and 150 microns for D, E.

Figure 4: Urinary incontinence (UI): associations with quantitative Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic changes (ADNC) assessed using digital neuropathologic evaluations in different brain regions. ADNC was operationalized by Aβ plaque (A) or pTau tangle (B) immunohistochemistry (IHC) using digital neuropathological methods that were previously described in detail [44]. There was a general tendency for both Aβ and pTau tangles to be higher in cases with UI across different anatomical regions. Looked at individually, some of the regions of interest showed nominally significant differences (UI+ vs UI− cases), where the ADNC was higher in UI cases than cases without UI. However, the statistical significance of individual regions (calculated with two-tailed Welch’s t-tests) did not survive at P&lt;0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons.
