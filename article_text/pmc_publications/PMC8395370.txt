Greater psychological distress is associated with cognitive impairment in healthy adults. Whether such associations also exist in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is uncertain. We assessed cognitive function in 496 individuals with CAD using the verbal and visual memory subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale and executive functioning measured by the Trail Making Test Parts A and B. We used a composite score of psychological distress derived through summation of Z-transformed psychological distress symptom scales (depression, posttraumatic stress, anxiety, anger, hostility and perceived stress) and scores for each individual psychological scale. Multivariable linear regression models were used to determine the association between memory scores (as outcomes) and the psychological distress scores (both composite score and individual scales). After adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors, a higher psychological distress score was independently associated with worse memory and executive functioning. Each standard deviation increase in psychological distress score was associated with 3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1%–5%) to 5% (95% CI, 3–7%) worse cognitive performance (higher Trail A and Trail B, and lower verbal and visual memory scores). Among individuals with CAD, a higher level of psychological distress is independently associated with worse cognitive performance. These findings suggest that psychological risk factors play a role in cognitive trajectories of persons with CAD.

1 | INTRODUCTION

Cognitive impairment is defined as deficits in memory with a detrimental impact on individuals’ independent living and quality of life, which, if left undiagnosed and untreated, could evolve into dementia over time (Mortamais et al., 2017). Cognitive impairment and coronary artery disease (CAD) are two major and inter-related global health challenges (Plassman et al., 2008; Virani et al., 2020), and individuals with CAD have a disproportionate risk of cognitive impairment and dementia compared to those without CAD (Schievink et al., 2017; Singh-Manoux et al., 2008; Stefanidis , Askew, Greaves, &amp; Summers, 2018; Xie, Zheng, Yan, &amp; Zhong, 2019). Both conditions share common risk factors that accelerate the atherosclerotic process (Meyer, Rauch, Rauch, &amp; Haque, 2000; de la Torre, 2002; Viswanathan, Greenberg, &amp; Scheltens, 2016). Given that more than 18 million individuals currently live with CAD in the United States (Virani et al., 2020), it is important to understand the determinants and mechanisms of cognitive decline in this population to develop appropriate interventions.

An understudied risk factor for both worse cognitive performance and CAD is psychological distress. While the potential mechanistic links between psychological distress and cognitive performance in the CAD population are not completely understood, putative factors include dysregulation in the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, resulting in higher cardiovascular reactivity with elevations in blood pressure and autonomic function imbalance (Fontes et al., 2014; Herman et al., 2016; Marko &amp; Riecansky, 2018; Miller et al., 2019). Measuring psychological distress is notoriously difficult, given its multiple domains and definitions (Kivimaki &amp; Steptoe, 2018), so most previous studies have relied on the assessment of particular aspects of psychological disturbance. Limited data have linked posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Edmondson, Kronish, Shaffer, Falzon, &amp; Burg, 2013; Flatt, Gilsanz, Quesenberry, Albers, &amp; Whitmer, 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Yaffe et al., 2010), anxiety (Batelaan, Seldenrijk, Bot, van Balkom, &amp; Penninx, 2016; Yang et al., 2020), anger (Sutin, Stephan, &amp; Terracciano, 2018), and hostility (Chida &amp; Steptoe, 2009; Sutin et al., 2018) with dementia. Similarly, depression, which is often a consequence of stressful experiences and has been conceptualized as part of stress spectrum disorders (Correll et al., 2017; Ritchie et al., 2020; Wager-Smith &amp; Markou, 2011; Yu, Jung, Go, Park, &amp; Ha, 2020), has also shown to increase the risk of dementia by twofold (Byers &amp; Yaffe, 2011). Other studies showed deficits in verbal declarative memory as measured with the Wechsler Memory Scale and other tests in PTSD and depression (Bremner et al., 1993; Burt, Zembar, &amp; Niederehe, 1995). No previous studies, however, have examined whether these associations exist in the CAD population. Furthermore, no previous research has considered these factors comprehensively. An integrative approach may be useful as these psychological distress components may share common biological or behavioral substrates, which could explain why they tend to cluster together (Suls &amp; Bunde, 2005). A global measure of psychological distress defined as a combination of symptoms related to depression, anxiety, anger, general distress, and perceived stress was previously shown to be associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease (Blumenthal et al., 2016). Given the importance of PTSD symptoms and hostility for cardiovascular risk, our group has added these two components to the global score for the prediction of future cardiovascular events in the CAD population (Pimple, Hammadah, et al., 2019). Therefore, examining them together as a global psychological distress phenotype may provide a more powerful approach for our understanding of determinants of cognitive function in individuals with CAD.

Accordingly, in the current study, we aimed to investigate the association of a composite measure of psychological distress with cognitive function in a sample of individuals with CAD with comprehensive measures of psychological distress. We also sought to understand which individual components (depressive symptoms, PTSD, anxiety, anger, hostility, and perceived stress) may have the strongest associations with cognitive parameters. We hypothesized that a higher global psychological distress score would have a more robust association with worse cognitive performance throughout all cognitive domains than any individual component.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Study sample

The Mental Stress Ischemia Mechanisms and Prognosis Study (MIPS) enrolled individuals with stable CAD from Emory University-affiliated hospitals and clinics. From a total number of 695 patients enrolled in MIPS, cognitive function measures were introduced after the enrolment had already begun and thus were available on a subset of 496 individuals. A detailed study protocol for MIPS has been previously published (Hammadah et al., 2017). The presence of CAD was defined based on a positive nuclear stress test, the presence of angiographic atherosclerosis, or a history of prior myocardial infarction or revascularization. Patients with a history of recent (&lt;1 week) acute coronary syndrome or decompensated heart failure, as well as those with end-stage renal disease, systolic blood pressure over 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure over 110 mm Hg on the day of the clinic visit or unstable psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, were excluded. Data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, medical history, and medication use of all participants were collected using standardized questionnaires, and clinical information was verified by medical record review. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Emory University, and all participants provided informed consent.

2.2 | Assessment of psychological distress

We used the Beck Depression Inventory for the assessment of depressive symptoms consisting of a 21-item self-administered scale with excellent internal consistency (Chronbach’s α = 0.91; Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996); the PTSD Symptom Checklist for the assessment of PTSD symptoms, a 17-item scale with Chronbach’s α of 0.94; Blanchard, Jones-Alexander, Buckley, &amp; Forneris et al., 1996); the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for the measurement of trait anxiety (Chronbach’s α = 0.95; Spielberger, Gorsuch, &amp; Lushene et al., 1970); the Spielberger’s State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory for the measurement of trait anger (Chronbach’s α &gt; 0.8; Spielberger, 1988); the Cook–Medley Hostility Scale for the assessment of hostility (Cook &amp; Medley, 1954); and the Perceived Stress Scale for the assessment of general perceived stress (Chronbach’s α = 0.84; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983). We then constructed a composite distress index by integrating these scales as previously described (Pimple, Hammadah, et al., 2019). Briefly, each psychological scale was converted into a z score variable by subtracting each scale’s mean from each score and then dividing the result by the standard deviation (SD) of each scale. These individual z scores were then summed up to derive a composite psychological distress index (Pimple, Hammadah, et al., 2019). In individuals with CAD, this composite score was related to the extent of resting perfusion abnormalities and future cardiovascular events (Pimple, Hammadah, et al., 2019; Pimple, Lima, et al., 2019). A similar composite score, without PTSD and hostility, was shown to improve with a stress management intervention (Blumenthal et al., 2016).

2.3 | Cognitive testing

We administered the Visual Reproduction and Logical Memory subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale according to the Russell revision (Russell, 1975). The Visual Reproduction subtest evaluates immediate and delayed visuospatial memory, and the Verbal Memory subtest evaluates immediate and delayed verbal declarative memory. For the visual memory test, each participant was asked to reproduce a series of line drawings, each presented for 10 s followed by immediate and then 30-min delayed recall. For the test of immediate verbal memory, participants were asked to recall the details of a short story immediately after it was read to them, and then, after a 30-min delay. Points were assigned, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function.

We also administered the Trail Making Test Parts A and B to evaluate visuomotor sequencing and set shifting, respectively (Filskov &amp; Goldstein, 1974). During Trails A, an individual was instructed to draw lines sequentially connecting 25 encircled numbers distributed on a sheet of paper. In contrast, during the more complex Trails B testing, the individual was asked to switch between numbers and letters rapidly. The score on each part represents the amount of time (in seconds required to complete the task. Lower scores on Trails A and B indicate better cognitive function.

2.4 | Statistical analysis

As previously described (Pimple, Hammadah, et al., 2019), each psychological scale was converted into a z-score and then z-scores were summed to derive a composite psychological distress index. We then compared the study sample characteristics according to quartiles of the composite psychological distress index, using either the analysis of variance test for normally distributed variables or the χ2 test for categorical variables. For the main analysis, multivariable linear regression models were used to determine the association between memory scores (as outcomes) and the psychological distress index (both as a continuous variable and categorical variable) as the main predictor variable. Similar analyses were performed separately for each psychological scale. Models were adjusted for demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education), cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities (history of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and revascularization), and medication use (aspirin, β-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). All analyses were conducted using Stata 14 (StataCorp.).

3 | RESULTS

The characteristics of the study sample are shown in Table 1. The mean age was 62 years, 71.6% were male, and 32.1% Black. History of dyslipidaemia was the most common comorbidity, followed by obesity and hypertension. Study participants with higher psychological distress were younger and more likely to be Black and less educated. Individuals with higher psychological distress also had higher β-blocker use rates, but no other important differences were observed in comorbidities or medication use according to psychological distress levels. Table 1 also shows that individuals with higher psychological scores had worse scores across all cognitive domains. Mean values for individual psychological measures are also shown in Table 1.

3.1 | Psychological distress and memory

As shown in Table 2 and Supplemental Table, after adjusting for demographic factors, comorbidities, and medication use, higher psychological distress (either the total score as a continuous variable or quartiles of increasing psychological distress) was associated with worse performance in all cognitive domains. As shown in Table 2, every SD increase in psychological distress score was associated with 3% (95% confidence interval [CI] [1%–5%]) to 5% (95% CI [3%–7%]) worse cognitive performance (higher Trails A and Trails B, and lower verbal and visual memory). Similarly, compared with the lowest quartile (low psychological distress), individuals in the highest psychological distress quartile (Quartile 4) had an adjusted 23% (95% CI [3%–48%]) to 52% (95% CI, 27%–77%) worse cognitive performance (Table 2). There was no effect modification by race or sex on the association between psychological distress scores and cognitive function.

Table 3 describes the associations between individual psychological measures and cognitive function. All scales showed associations with several dimensions of cognitive performance. Higher depressive symptoms were independently associated with higher Trail B scores (worse executive function) and lower verbal memory scores (both immediate and delayed). Similar associations were found for anxiety scores. Scores for PTSD and hostility showed the most consistent associations with cognitive impairment, such that each SD increment in either PTSD or hostility scores was associated with 10% (95% CI [1%–18%]) to 18% (95% CI [9%–26%]) worse memory function in all cognitive domains. Higher scores for State-Trait Anger were only associated with worse immediate and delayed verbal memory. In contrast, a higher perceived stress score was associated with worse performance in both Trails A and Trails B as well as the immediate and delayed verbal memory tests.

4 | DISCUSSION

Among individuals with CAD, we observed that psychological distress, defined as a composite measure of six scales (depression, PTSD, anxiety, anger, hostility, and perceived stress) was associated with worse memory and executive function. When individual psychological scales were examined separately, the magnitude of the effect size was fairly consistent across the various scale scores. However, the associations were most consistent across cognitive domains for PTSD and hostility. These findings suggest that multiple aspects of psychological distress are associated with worse cognitive performance in the CAD population. Our results suggest that using a composite measure may show a higher sensitivity for detecting impairments in cognitive function than individual scales and highlights the potential advantage of measuring an individual’s overall psychological distress in uncovering its impact on multiple cognitive domains (executive function and both verbal and visual memory).

Previous reports have shown that a history of depression and current depressive symptoms are associated with the risk of dementia (D. E. Barnes et al., 2012; Canton-Habas, Rich-Ruiz, Romero-Saldana, &amp; Carrera-Gonzalez, 2020; Ownby, Crocco, Acevedo, John, &amp; Loewenstein, 2006; Ritchie et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Consistent with these previous data, in our study depressive symptoms were associated with both executive function and memory performance. In addition to depression symptoms, symptoms of PTSD and hostility showed consistent associations with cognitive impairment across all memory domains. Symptoms of PTSD have previously shown to increase the risk of dementia among male veterans as well as those from the general population (Flatt et al., 2018; Meziab et al., 2014; Sutin et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2016; Yaffe et al., 2010). However, studies investigating the association between hostility and cognition have shown mixed results (Albanese et al., 2016; L. L. Barnes et al., 2009; Sutin et al., 2018). Our findings suggest that these psychological stressors’ contribution to cognitive performance may be especially pronounced among those with pre-existing CAD.

There are limited data on the relationship of anger with cognitive performance. Among 9,913 participants in the Health and Retirement Study, anger was not associated with cognitive impairment or dementia after 6–8 years of follow-up (Sutin et al., 2018). Our results showed that a higher anger trait was associated with worse verbal memory in individuals with CAD and suggest that anger might play a role in cognitive impairment in this population. However, by examining a comprehensive panel of psychological scales, our study shows that several psychological disturbances, not just a few in isolation, may contribute to cognitive impairment.

Behavioural and traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking are important contributors to cognitive impairment and dementia (Norton, Matthews, Barnes, Yaffe, &amp; Brayne, 2014; Xing et al., 2020). These risk factors are also commonly associated with psychological distress. However, our results show that the associations between psychological distress and cognitive impairment were independent of cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that the latter do not account for much of the relationship between psychological status and risk of cognitive impairment among individuals with CAD.

Several biological mechanisms may be involved in the link between psychological distress and cognitive impairment. Chronic or repeated psychological distress is accompanied by dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, cardiovascular reactivity with increase in blood pressure, reduced heart rate variability and higher inflammatory activity (Fontes et al., 2014; Herman et al., 2016; Marko &amp; Riecansky, 2018; Miller et al., 2019). These processes are also associated with worse cognition through possible neuronal or glial injury, cerebrovascular dysfunction, and an increase in β-amyloid deposition (Forte, Favieri, &amp; Casagrande, 2019; Thayer &amp; Lane, 2000; Walker et al., 2019). Future studies are needed to examine the exact mechanisms for the association between psychological distress and cognitive function in high-risk individuals like those with CAD.

While our findings suggest that psychological distress may increase the risk of cognitive impairment, the opposite pathway is also possible, that is, worse memory and executive function may cause psychological distress. For instance, individuals with cognitive impairment have shown to be at a higher risk for anxiety and depressive disorders later in life (Chen, Ganguli, Mulsant, &amp; DeKosky, 1999; Mirza et al., 2017; Petkus, Reynolds, Wetherell, Kremen, &amp; Gatz et al., 2017; Sussams et al., 2020). This phenomenon could reflect ongoing brain disease, a psychological reaction of individuals to their awareness of their cognitive decline or both. Previous studies have shown that individuals with dementia and depression show a more pronounced degeneration of the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra than those without depression (Daulatzai, 2016; Heneka et al., 2010). Also, those with depression and early cognitive impairment have shown to have a higher self-awareness of their memory loss (Chen et al., 1999; Wiels, Baeken, &amp; Engelborghs, 2020). These findings suggest that the association between psychological distress and cognitive impairment is likely bidirectional and common pathological pathways may also be involved in linking them together.

Our study had several strengths. This is the first study investigating the association between a comprehensive measure of psychological distress and cognitive function in a large sample of individuals with CAD. Second, our study population was well characterized clinically and thoroughly examined for psychological factors, as well as for cognitive function across multiple domains. The main limitation of this study was the cross-sectional design, which precluded any determination of causality between the psychological distress measures and memory impairment. We also excluded individuals with a recent history of acute coronary syndrome or decompensated heart failure, which may indicate more severe CAD and potentially reduce the generalizability of our results to sicker patients. Although our psychological distress measures included symptom dimensions relevant for CAD patients, our findings should be replicated using other validated psychological scales. Less common psychiatric manifestations are worth exploring, such as somatization, obsessive-compulsive behaviours, and phobic anxiety. Larger studies are needed to explore the relationship between these conditions and cognitive function.

In conclusion, we found that among individuals with CAD, a higher level of psychological distress is associated with worse cognitive performance independent of demographic and clinical risk factors. These findings suggest that psychological risk factors play a role in cognitive trajectories of persons with CAD, although prospective studies are needed to confirm this relationship. Future research is also needed to explore the possibility of treatment modalities, such as stress reduction interventions to mitigate the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in this population.
