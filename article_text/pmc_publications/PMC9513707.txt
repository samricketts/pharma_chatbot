Importance:

Estimating mortality risk in older adults with dementia is important for guiding decisions such as cancer screening, treatment of new and chronic medical conditions, and advance care planning.

Objective:

To develop and externally validate a mortality prediction model in community-dwelling older adults with dementia.

Design:

Cohort study involving participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1998-2016 (derivation cohort) and National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) from 2011-2019 (validation cohort).

Setting:

Community-dwelling.

Participants:

Older adults aged ≥65 years with probable dementia.

Exposures:

Candidate predictors included demographics, behavioral/health factors, functional measures (e.g., activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)), and chronic conditions.

Main Outcomes and Measures:

The primary outcome was time to all-cause death. We used Cox proportional hazards regression with backward selection and multiple imputation for model development. Model performance was assessed by discrimination (integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC)) and calibration (plots of predicted and observed mortality).

Results:

Of 4,267 participants with probable dementia in HRS, mean age was 82.2 years (standard deviation=7.6), 69.4% were female, and 12.1% identified as Black. Median follow-up time was 3.9 years (interquartile range 2.0-6.8), and 3,466 (81.2%) participants died by end of follow-up. The final model included age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, ADL dependency count, IADL difficulty count, difficulty walking several blocks, participation in vigorous physical activity, and chronic conditions (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease). The optimism-corrected iAUC after bootstrap internal validation was 0.756 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.746-0.759) with time-specific AUC of 0.726 (95% CI=0.703-0.750) at 1-year, 0.751 (95% CI=0.735-0.766) at 5-years, and 0.836 (95% CI=0.818-0.854) at 10-years. Upon external validation in NHATS (n=2,404), AUC was 0.733 (95% CI=0.705-0.761) at 1-year and 0.737 (95% CI=0.713-0.760) at 5-years. Calibration plots suggested good calibration across the range of predicted risk from 1-10 years.

Conclusions and Relevance:

We developed and externally validated a mortality prediction model in community-dwelling older adults with dementia that showed good discrimination and calibration. The mortality risk estimates can help guide discussions regarding treatment decisions and advance care planning.


pmcIntroduction

Dementia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is associated with increased mortality risk.1-3 An estimated 6.5 million Americans aged ≥65 are living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in 2022.4,5 The clinical course of individuals with dementia is highly variable, with median survival time from age at diagnosis ranging from 3.3 years to 11.7 years.6 Heterogeneity in prognosis has important implications for decisions related to financial planning, advance care planning, long-term care admission, and clinical care. For interventions that have immediate risks or burdens and delayed benefits, such as cancer screening and tight glycemic control in patients with diabetes, life expectancy can help differentiate between patients most likely to benefit versus most likely to be harmed by interventions.7 Therefore, accurate estimates of life expectancy in people with dementia are important for providing the foundational data for patients, family, and clinicians to help define patient-centered care goals in their remaining lifetime.7,8

Mortality prediction models are one tool that can help estimate an individual’s prognosis. Several non-disease-specific mortality indices have been developed among community-dwelling older adults, and they are readily available on websites such as ePrognosis.9-12 However, their utility may be limited if the populations in which they were developed were not entirely inclusive of individuals with conditions that have a dramatic impact on mortality (e.g., dementia or advanced cancer).9

Several mortality prediction models have been developed specifically in individuals with dementia.13 The most well-known is the Advanced Dementia Prognostic Tool (ADEPT) which estimates 6-month mortality in nursing home patients with advanced dementia.14,15 However, for the ~70% of older adults living with dementia in the community, there are currently no well-established mortality models.4 This population is more heterogenous in terms of cognition, comorbidities, and daily functioning when compared to a nursing home population. Previously published models of community-dwelling older adults with dementia have several limitations, including small sample sizes, outdated data, lack of validation, and poor analytic strategies.13

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and externally validate a mortality prediction model in two nationally representative cohorts of community-dwelling older adults with dementia in the United States (US). Information from this model can be used to facilitate discussions regarding clinical care and advance care planning.

Methods

This study’s reporting was guided by the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement (eTable 1 in the Supplement).16

Study design and population

We used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) between 1998-2016, a nationally representative survey of US adults aged ≥51 in which participants are interviewed every 2 years.17 For individuals who could not participate in the interview (e.g., physical/cognitive reasons), HRS performs proxy interviews typically with a spouse/other family member to help reduce attrition bias.18 We included information from both sample respondents and proxy interviews.

We included community-dwelling older adults aged ≥65 with probable dementia ascertained by a previously validated algorithm (eMethods in the Supplement).19 This algorithm has high accuracy when compared to gold-standard dementia diagnoses from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study.19-21 Participants were included from the date of interview when predicted probability of dementia exceeded 0.5.

For external validation, we used the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 from 2011-2019.22 We included individuals classified as having probable dementia based on defined cutoffs (eMethods in the Supplement).23

Outcomes

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Information on mortality in HRS was collected until May 31, 2019 in multiple ways to ensure accurate and complete ascertainment. We primarily used information from the HRS Tracker File which ascertains mortality through exit interviews with next-of-kin and the National Death Index (NDI). This method has been shown to be highly accurate and effectively complete.24 To further increase accuracy, we searched Medicare data files (Denominator File, Master Beneficiary Summary File, and Inpatient files) and the NDI.

Candidate Predictors

Candidate predictor variables were identified through previously published systematic reviews of risk factors for mortality in individuals with dementia and performing an independent review of mortality models for community-dwelling individuals with dementia (eMethods in the Supplement).6,13,25-29 All candidate predictors were collected at the time of the HRS interview wave when dementia probability was &gt;0.5. Detailed definitions of all candidate variables are provided in eTable 2 in the Supplement.

Briefly, predictors included demographic factors, such as age category (65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, 90+), sex, and marital status. Health/behavioral factors included body mass index (BMI) category (&lt;18.5kg/m2, 18.5 to &lt;25kg/m2, 25 to &lt;30kg/m2, and ≥30kg/m2), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, current smoker), and participation in vigorous physical activity (hardly ever/never vs. any vigorous physical activity). Functional status was assessed by count of difficulties or dependencies with activities of daily living (ADL, including dressing, bathing, eating, getting in/out of bed, and toileting with range 0-5) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs, including preparing meals, managing medications, managing money, grocery shopping, and using telephone with range 0-5). In general, difficulty and dependency with individual ADLs/IADLs were defined by self or proxy-report of difficulty performing the task or needing help with the task, respectively. Self-reported comorbidities included cancer (excluding minor skin cancer), diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, hypertension, and stroke. Definitions of these predictors largely overlapped in NHATS (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

Model development

We used Cox proportional hazards regression with all candidate predictors to develop the model. To create a parsimonious model that can more efficiently be used in clinical practice, we performed variable selection using backward selection. Since this process may lead to a final set of predictors that is unstable, we combined the backward selection process with bootstrapping and multiple imputation.30-33 As some variables had incomplete baseline data, we first performed multiple imputation (MI) assuming the data were missing at random to create 20 imputed datasets. We created 30 bootstrap samples for each of the 20 imputed datasets. We performed a backward selection process with a p-value of &lt;0.05 for elimination in each of the imputed datasets within each bootstrap sample. Variables that were selected in &gt;60% of the 20 imputed datasets (≥12 times) and &gt;50% of the 30 bootstrap samples (≥15 times) were included. We explored different percentage thresholds based on previous research without any significant changes in predictors included.30,34 To account for the complex survey design of the HRS, we incorporated survey weights and strata at each stage. The final model coefficients were obtained by pooling results across imputations. To evaluate the impact of proxy responses, we included a proxy variable as a candidate predictor and separately evaluated models in proxy and non-proxy respondents. As the results were not substantially different with either method, we report the pooled model without an indicator for proxy status. We also performed a sensitivity analysis only including incident cases of probable dementia.

Model evaluation

Model performance was assessed through discrimination, calibration, and the Brier score. For discrimination, we calculated the integrated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC) which averages all available AUC statistics over time.35-37 We also report time-specific values at clinically relevant time points of 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Calibration refers to the agreement between observed and predicted probability of mortality. This was assessed graphically at fixed time points.38 As an overall measure of model performance, we calculated the integrated Brier score, a scoring rule affected by both discrimination and calibration with lower scores indicating better model accuracy.39

We assessed internal validity via bootstrapping to quantify any optimism in model performance. We repeated the entire modeling process (including variable selection) in 30 bootstrapped samples and averaged the individual iAUC values to obtain an optimism-corrected iAUC. We externally validated the final prediction model by examining model performance in NHATS. As the length of follow-up time in NHATS did not allow us to provide estimates at 10-years, we present time-specific AUC values and calibration plots at 1, 2, and 5 years. To present the final model, we provide beta-coefficients and baseline survival at specific time points to facilitate calculation of individual predictions. We also created a web application to input individual patient characteristics to obtain mortality risk estimates. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc), Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC), and R version 4.05 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

Results

Cohort characteristics

Of the 43,398 participants aged ≥65 in the HRS between 1998-2016, we included 4,267 participants with probable dementia (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). The mean age when participants were classified as having dementia was 82.2 years (standard deviation=7.6) (Table 1). In the HRS cohort, 69.4% were female and 12.1% identified as Black. The amount of missing information was generally less than 1%. The median follow-up time was 3.9 years (interquartile range (IQR) 2.0-6.8) in the overall cohort, 3.5 years (IQR 1.6-6.2) among those who died, and 5.2 years (IQR 3.0-8.6) among those who did not die by end of follow-up. A total of 3,466 participants (81.2%) died by the end of follow-up.

The external validation cohort from NHATS included 2,404 individuals with probable dementia (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Demographics were similar to HRS, although a greater proportion of individuals had functional impairments and were Black (Table 1). Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in eFigures 3 and 4. The histogram of the prognostic index showed decreased case-mix heterogeneity in NHATS (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). By the end of follow-up, 1,426 participants (59.3%) had died.

Model development

eTable 4 in the Supplement shows the unadjusted hazard ratios for all candidate predictors. The final variables following variable selection were age category, sex, BMI category, smoking status, number of ADL dependencies, number of IADL difficulties, difficulty walking several blocks, participation in vigorous physical activity, and chronic conditions including diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and lung disease. Table 2 displays the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and beta-coefficients for variables in the model.

Model evaluation

The iAUC prior to internal validation was 0.758 (95% CI 0.748-0.761) (Table 3). After bootstrap internal validation, the optimism-corrected iAUC was 0.756 (95% CI 0.746-0.759) suggesting good discrimination. AUC values tended to increase over time (eFigure 6 in the Supplement). For example, the optimism-corrected time-specific AUC at 1-year was 0.726 (95% CI=0.703-0.750), 0.751 (95% CI=0.735-0.766) at 5-years, and 0.836 (95% CI=0.818-0.854) at 10-years. Figure 1 displays the predicted versus observed risk of death at the 1, 2, 5, and 10-year time-points across deciles of predicted risk. This showed that the model was well calibrated with good agreement between observed and predicted risk. The integrated Brier score averaged from 20 imputations was 0.10. Results from the sensitivity analysis only including incident probable dementia cases showed similar model coefficients and performance (eResults 1, eTables 5-6, and eFigure 7 in the Supplement).

Upon external validation in NHATS, the calibration slope was 0.920 (95% CI=0.842-0.999). The time-specific AUC values were 0.733 (95% CI=0.705-0.761) at 1-year, 0.725 (95% CI=0.702-0.748) at 2-years, and 0.737 (95% CI=0.713-0.760) at 5-years (Table 3). Calibration was similar to HRS (Figure 1).

Users can input individual patient characteristics on ePrognosis (https://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/dementia.php) to obtain mortality risk estimates (eFigures 8-9). eResults 2 in the Supplement shows how to manually compute mortality risk. For illustration, we selected 10 participants at random within each decile of predicted risk and display their baseline characteristics and median predicted time to death (Figure 2). For example, patient G is an 81-year-old woman with BMI of 19.5, never smoker, 3 ADL dependencies, 4 IADL difficulties, and walking difficulty. Her median time to death is 3.8 years (interquartile range 1.9-6.3) with predicted mortality risk of 12% at 1-year, 64% at 5-years, and 94% at 10-years.

Discussion

We developed and externally validated a mortality prediction model in community-dwelling older adults with dementia that can be used to estimate mortality risk across a time frame of 1-10 years. We included variables that are readily obtainable in clinical practice, including demographics, functional status, health/behavioral factors, and comorbidities. Measures of model performance, including discrimination and calibration, were good and generally exceeded the discrimination in previous dementia mortality prediction models.

Our model provides accurate prognostic estimates for a heterogenous population of community-dwelling older adults with dementia that can be used to enhance conversations with patients and families and inform decision making. Several clinical guidelines related to cancer screening and management of chronic diseases now encourage the use of life expectancy when making treatment decisions.40-43 Given the broad range of mortality risk in our cohort, providing these estimates in a clinical context can help frame screening and treatment decisions by targeting interventions to those most likely to benefit.44 Similarly, they can help families prepare for the future in terms of advance care planning and financial planning. Nonetheless, we recognize that the mortality estimates from our model are only one of many factors that go into decision making for older adults with dementia and should be incorporated within the broader context of patient and family goals and preferences.

The final predictors in our mortality model represent variables commonly used in prediction models involving community-dwelling older adults and those previously identified as predictive of mortality among individuals with dementia.6,9,25,26 In line with previous studies, older age had a strong effect on mortality with female sex being a protective factor.13,25 A BMI &lt;18.5 compared to 18.5-25 was associated with increased mortality risk which is consistent with previous studies.10,45-47 We included several functional measures (ADL dependencies, difficulties with cognitively-demanding IADLs, difficulty walking several blocks, and participation in vigorous physical activity) which have been consistently shown to influence prognostic estimates in mortality indices likely because they represent the end-impact of chronic diseases.48,49

Given that this was a community-dwelling cohort covering a wide range of dementia severity, our focus was to estimate prognosis over years rather than months. Therefore, we did not include predictors such as pressure ulcers or time spent in bed that are often included in models assessing hospice eligibility in those with severe dementia. The final predictors in our model suggest that prognosis in a community-dwelling cohort is often driven by comorbid disease.

A 2021 systematic review and our review of mortality models in persons with dementia identified many models at high risk of bias (ROB) due to methodologic limitations, including small sample sizes, lack of internal/external validation, and not reporting model calibration (eMethods and eTables 7-9 in the Supplement).13 A few mortality models are worth noting in comparison to our model. The model by Haaksma et al. (2020) developed in Sweden presents three-year survival probabilities from a simplified model that includes age, sex, Mini-Mental State Exam score, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and dementia type.50 The model by van de Vorst et al. (2020) developed in the Netherlands presents one-year mortality risk using age, sex, setting of care, and modified CCI.51 The concordance-statistics ranged from 0.69-0.72 which is somewhat lower than our study. Advantages of our model include longer follow-up duration, greater applicability for individuals in the US, and inclusion of functional measures that might explain improved model performance.

Notable models in US populations include Newcomer et al. (2003), Armstrong et al. (2022), and several longitudinal Grade of Membership (L-GoM) models.52-58 Newcomer et al. (2003) included participants enrolled in the Medicare Alzheimer’s Disease Demonstration Evaluation.52 The primary limitations are that the data comes from 1989-1994, and the paper does not easily allow calculations of individual mortality risk. Armstrong et al. (2022) used data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinator Center (NACC) and report 5-year survival probabilities for individuals with different types of dementia.58 A possible limitation is the generalizability of the NACC population. The L-GoM models offer a flexible approach to modeling future trajectories across multiple endpoints, and the most recent update demonstrated accurate mortality predictions based on a single comprehensive visit.53 Disadvantages include unclear generalizability (developed using ~250 participants in the Predictors 1 (1989-2001) and Predictors 2 (1997-2007) cohorts at three academic research centers) and a large number of variables (79 clinical signs/symptoms).59

Strengths and limitations

This study has several strengths. We included a large cohort of community-dwelling individuals with dementia to predict mortality with good discrimination and calibration up to 10 years. The final variables in the model are readily obtainable and can be inputted into an online calculator to obtain prognostic estimates. We performed an external validation in NHATS and found similar discrimination and calibration.

Our study has a few limitations. First, participants were classified as having dementia using a validated algorithm which may be subject to misclassification. While this algorithm has shown high accuracy in validation studies (e.g., AUC of 0.93 in training data and 0.84 in validation data), the overall accuracy is reduced in certain subgroups, such as racial/ethnic minorities and less-educated individuals.19,20,60 Second, information on dementia etiology (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease or vascular disease) or dementia severity was not available. We also chose not to include cognitive tests as candidate predictors, instead relying on cognitively demanding IADLs as a proxy of cognitive status. We did this because cognitive tests were only available for self (non-proxy) responses, and it is often challenging to guide patients with dementia through cognitive testing in routine clinical settings. The fact that our model performance was an improvement on previous models that included measures assessing cause and severity of dementia suggests that our model can still provide predictions that inform decision-making without this data. Third, the follow-up duration in NHATS precluded external validation at 10-years. Given that model performance after internal and external validation was relatively similar at 5-years, it is likely that our internal validation results from HRS at 10-years will remain accurate. However, future validation studies in other cohorts with longer follow-up times should be performed.

Conclusion

We developed and externally validated a mortality model with good discrimination and calibration that can be used to estimate mortality risk up to 10 years in community-dwelling older adults with dementia. Final predictors in the model are readily obtainable in clinical practice, including demographics, behavioral/health factors, functional status, and comorbidities. Estimates can be used by clinicians, patients, and families to help aid in discussions around clinical management of medical comorbidities, preventative screening, and advance care planning.

Figure 1: Calibration plots at the 1, 2, 5, and 10-year time points for the mortality prediction model in the Health and Retirement Study and National Health and Aging Trends Study cohorts

Calibration plots indicate the agreement between the predicted mortality risk using the prediction model and observed mortality at various time points. Individual dots represent deciles of predicted risk. Perfect predictions would be at the 45-degree line. Each plot also contains a density plot displaying the distribution of predicted risk in the individual cohort. Data from the Health and Retirement Study are presented as blue dots and blue shaded density plots, and data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study are presented as pink dots and pink shaded density plots. Calibration in NHATS was not assessed at 10 years as the duration of follow-up was not long enough. Abbreviations: HRS, Health and Retirement Study; NHATS, National Health and Aging Trends Study

Figure 2: Baseline characteristics and median predicted time to death in years of 10 randomly selected individuals with dementia from the Health and Retirement Study within each decile of predicted risk

In the upper panel, baseline characteristics are displayed for 10 randomly selected individuals from the Health and Retirement Study within each decile of predicted risk. The color and shading indicate the direction and magnitude of the specific characteristic’s impact on mortality risk, respectively. For example, going from light to dark pink indicates increasing hazard of mortality whereas green indicates lower hazard of mortality. In the lower panel, the median predicted time to death in years based on the individual’s baseline characteristics is displayed. The end of the whiskers indicate the 25th and 75th percentile of the median predicted time to death. While age has a strong prognostic impact, individuals may have high predicted mortality risk due to multiple other factors including functional impairments and comorbidities.

a The corresponding hazard ratio indicates the increase in hazard of death for each additional ADL dependency and IADL difficulty (range 0-5). ADL dependencies include needing help with dressing, bathing, eating, getting in or out of bed, and toileting. IADL difficulties include difficulty using a telephone, preparing a meal, managing medications, managing money such as paying bills, and shopping for groceries.

b This variable involves taking part in sports or activities that are vigorous, such as running or jogging, swimming, cycling, aerobics or gym workout, tennis, or digging with a spade or shovel. Individuals were characterized as either participating in vigorous physical activity vs. hardly ever or never performing vigorous physical activity.

The time-specific AUC values represent a measure of discrimination up until time point t (i.e., the ability of the linear predictor from the mortality model to separate the cumulative cases through time t from the controls at time t). Therefore, the value for the time-specific AUC at 10 years includes all the cumulative information available from baseline up until 10 years.

a The number remaining at risk indicates the number of individuals remaining in the study cohorts at specific time points as individuals either die (outcome event) or are censored. See Supplementary Figures 3 and 4 for Kaplan-Meier curves along with the number remaining at risk.

b We report time-specific AUC for the NHATS external validation rather than overall iAUC because several participants only had information on month of death rather than exact date of death in NHATS. Additionally, only month of interview was known in NHATS. This led to inaccurate estimates of model discrimination for very short-term mortality risk (due to short survival times in multiples of 30 or 31 days when compared to HRS where exact date of death was known) which was not the primary focus of our mortality model.

c The AUC at 10 years is not reported for the NHATS external validation because the time period of observation was not long enough to obtain estimates at 10 years.

Abbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; CI, confidence interval; HRS, Health and Retirement Study; iAUC, integrated AUC; NHATS, National Health and Aging Trends Study; NR, not reported

Key Points:

Question:

Can we accurately predict time to death in community-dwelling older adults with dementia?

Findings:

We used two nationally representative cohorts of community-dwelling older adults with dementia from 1998-2016 and 2011-2019 to develop and externally validate a mortality prediction model. The final model includes readily available clinical predictors (demographics, health factors, functional measures, and chronic conditions) to predict mortality from 1-10 years with good discrimination and calibration.

Meaning:

Mortality predictions using this prognostic model can help inform conversations between clinicians, patients, and families related to advance care planning and clinical decisions such as cancer screening.
