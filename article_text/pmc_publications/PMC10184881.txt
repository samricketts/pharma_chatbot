The receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase D (PTPRD) is expressed by neurons and implicated in interesting phenotypes that include reward from addictive substances, restless leg syndrome and neurofibrillary tangle densities in Alzheimer’s disease (AD-NFTs). However, the brain phosphotyrosine phosphoprotein (PTPP) substrates for PTPRD’s phosphatase have not been clearly defined. Although we have identified small molecule inhibitors of PTPRD’s phosphatase that are candidates for reducing reward from addictive substances, no positive allosteric modulators of this phosphatase that might be candidates for reducing AD-NFTs have been reported.

We now report identification of candidate brain substrates for PTPRD based on their increased phosphorylation in knockout vs wildtype animals, coexpression with PTPRD in neuronal subtypes and brisk dephosphorylation by recombinant human PTPRD phosphatase. We also report discovery that quercetin and other flavonols, though not closely-related flavones, enhance rates of PTPRD’s dephosphorylation of a group of these candidate substrate PTPPs but not others. This substrate-selective positive allosteric modulation provides a novel pharmacological action. Flavonol-mediated increases in PTPRD’s dephosphorylation of the GSK3 β and α kinases that hyperphosphorylate tau, the major component of AD-NFTs, could help to explain recent data concerning genetic and dietary impacts on Alzheimer’s disease.

pmc1. Introduction

More than 100 receptor- (PTPR) and non-receptor (PTPN) type protein tyrosine phosphatases regulate normal and pathological cell functions by dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine phosphoproteins (PTPPs) (1). Different phosphatases can act differentially on different groups of PTPP substrates (2). However, the likely physiological and/or pathophysiological substrates for many of these phosphatases remain unknown. Specific pharmacological inhibitors or positive allosteric modulators have been identified for only a modest subset of these phosphatases (3).

The receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase D, PTPRD, is one of the most highly-expressed neuronal protein tyrosine phosphatases (4, 5). PTPRD binds to extracellular ligands in ways that (likely) alter activities of its intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase and thus contribute to the maturation of synapses of PTPRD-expressing neurons (4, 6). Genome-wide association (GWAS) studies associate common PTPRD genomic variation with individual differences in densities of neurofibrillary pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (7), vulnerability to develop a substance use disorder (4), ability to quit (smoking, use of opiates, use of alcohol aided by an opiate antagonist) (4, 8, 9), vulnerability to develop restless leg syndrome (RLS) (10) and levels of PTPRD mRNA expression in postmortem brains (11). Mouse model and other post GWAS data support many of these associations (4). Such results motivate work to improve understanding of physiological and pathological PTPRD substrates and to identify inhibitors and positive allosteric modulators of PTPRD’s actions on these substrates.

We now report identification of candidate physiological substrates for brain PTPRD phosphatase. We evaluate two PTPPs whose abundance is increased in C. elegans with knockout of its PTPRD homolog, LAR (12). We then use phosphoproteomics and RNAseq data to identify PTPPs that display increased abundance in brains of mice with reduced PTPRD expression and are encoded by genes that are coexpressed with PTPRD, nominating “second stage” candidate PTPRD substrates. We confirm brisk dephosphorylation of synthetic PTPPeps corresponding to many of these candidate PTPRD substrates by PTPRD’s phosphatase. These genes, including the glycogen synthase kinase 3s GSK3β and GSK3α, provide “third stage” candidate physiological PTPRD substrates.

We also identify flavonol positive allosteric modulation (PAM) of PTPRD phosphatase activities in dephosphorylating synthetic GSK3β/GSK3α phosphotyrosine phosphopeptide (PTPPep). There is micromolar potency and specificity; flavonones lack this activity. Remarkably, quercetin provides substrate-selective positive allosteric modulation. It increases PTPRD’s dephosphorylation of GSK3β/α PTPPep and a group of other candidate PTPRD substrates, but not its dephosphorylation of other substrates. We discuss these data in light of genetic and environmental influences on AD and AD-NFTs as well as in silico observations that nominate a potential molecular mechanism for this positive allosteric modulation.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 Mice and brains:

Mice with reduced PTPRD expression and wildtype littermates were bred from heterozygote x heterozygote crosses, fed moistened food on cage floors until weaning and genotyped as described (11, 13, 14). Mice were sacrificed by rapid cervical dislocation, brains rapidly removed, split by a midsagittal razor blade cut, rapidly frozen using dry ice and maintained at −80°C until analyses. All procedures were approved by the NMVAHCS Animal care and use committee (13).

2.2 Western analyses:

Protein were extracted (15) from frozen brain samples using a hand held sonicator (Branson, Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro NJ) in 20 ml/g wet weight T-PER (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham MA) with 1:1000 complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 tab/10 ml phosphatase inhibitor cocktail set II (both Milllipore-Sigma, St Louis MO). Proteins in supernatant from 10,000 x g/30 min/4°C centrifugation were separated by electrophoresis under reducing conditions using precast gels (PCG2012 TruPAGE, Millipore-Sigma, St Louis MO) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (88018 Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA). Membranes were preincubated for 30 min in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (TBST: 0.1M Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti pY15 CDK5 or rabbit anti pY279 GSK3α/β or anti β-actin control (each 1:500, Millipore-Sigma St Louis MO) overnight at 4°C in 5% milk in TBST buffer, washed 3x/10 min in TBST, incubated with secondary antibody (925–32211 LiCOR) for 1 h at 22°C, washed 3x in TBST, imaged and quantified (LI-COR Odyssey; LI-COR Biosciences).

2.3 Phosphotyrosine phosphoproteomic analyses:

We used mass spectrographic analyses and quantitation of immunoprecipitated tryptic phosphotyrosine phosphopeptides extracted from frozen mouse half brains as described (16). Frozen half brains were sonicated in urea lysis buffer; sonicate was centrifuged, reduced with DTT and alkylated with iodoacetamide. 15 mg protein from each sample was digested with trypsin and purified over C18 columns for enrichment using phosphotyrosine pY-1000 motif antibodies #8803 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Enriched peptides were purified over C18 STAGE tips (17) and subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses. Phosphopeptides were eluted using 90-minute linear gradients of acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid delivered at 280 nL/min. Tandem mass spectra were collected using a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion™ Lumos™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer with a top-twenty MS/MS method, a dynamic repeat count of one and a repeat duration of 30 sec. Real time recalibration of mass error was performed using lock mass (18) with a singly charged polysiloxane ion m/z = 371.101237.

MS/MS spectra were evaluated using Comet and the Core platform (18–20). Files were searched against the SwissProt Mus musculus FASTA database. A mass accuracy of +/−5 ppm was used for precursor ions and 0.02 daltons for product ions. At least one tryptic (K- or R-containing) terminus was required per peptide; up to four mis-cleavages were allowed. Cysteine carboxamidomethylation was specified as a static modification. Methionine oxidation and phosphorylation on serine, threonine and/ or tyrosine residues were allowed as variable modifications. Reverse decoy databases were included to estimate false discovery rates (FDR) and filtered using Core’s linear discriminant module with a 1.0% FDR. Peptides were filtered for the presence of a tyrosine phosphorylated residue (strict motif) or serine/threonine phosphorylated residue within 2 amino acids of a tyrosine (lax motif). Quantitative results were generated using Skyline (21) to extract the integrated peak areas of the corresponding peptide assignments. Accuracy of quantitative data was ensured by manual review in Skyline and/or in the ion chromatogram files.

2.4 Phosphatase/dephosphorylation assays:

Recombinant PTPRD phosphatase protein (&gt; 95% purity) was produced in E Coli from a His-tagged construct as described (13, 22). PTPRS, PTPRF, PTP1B/PTPN1 and PTPRJ phosphatases (&gt;95% purity) were purchased from BPS Biosciences (San Diego CA). We synthesized human PTPPeps (&gt; 95% purity; Thermo-Fisher, Waltham MA) and compared PTPRD effects to those of the positive control END[pY]INASL (Promega. Madison WI) studied in the same experiments.

Orthophosphate release assays (Promega V2471) used Malachite green and molybdate with spectrophotometric detection of liberated free orthophosphate from test phosphopeptides compared to control/comparison phosphopeptides with assessments for the times indicated. Reactions were carried out in half-area 96-well plates with three wells dedicated for each time point. To each experimental well, we added a mixture of 18 μL of ultrapure water, 25 μL of running buffer (43.4 μM HEPES (pH 7.4), 2.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.44% acetylated bovine serum albumin, 22.2 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM EDTA) and 1 μL of a 10mM DMSO solution of the desired peptide. 50 μL of molybdate dye mixture was added at t =0, followed by 5 μL of a 1:100 dilution of enzyme in dilution buffer (22.9 mM pH 7.4 HEPES, 1% acetylated bovine serum albumin, 4.6 mM dithiothreitol). In control experiments, we added enzyme that was heated to 100°C for 20 min, cooled and added to reactions similarly. Other wells were initiated via the addition of 5 μL of the diluted enzyme mixture @ t=0 and terminated at the desired timepoints by addition of 50 μL of the dye solution. Results were derived from triplicate independent experiments that assessed the slopes of linear regions of 605 nm absorbance increases from a 5 to 15 min incubation timepoints obtained from a Spectromax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, San Jose CA). Nominal levels of significance were assessed using two-tailed t-tests with α = 0.05.

pNPP dephosphorylation to p-nitrophenolate was assessed using pNPP substrate, 405 nm detection of the dephosphorylation product, controls with 5 × 10−5 M 7-BIA and 18 min incubations as described (13). For assays determining the effect of flavonoids on pNPP hydrolysis, a 96 well half-area plate was prepared by first filling each well to be tested with 40 μL of 50 µM pNPP, 46 μL of running buffer and 4 μL of DMSO containing the desired concentration of flavonoid and/or peptide. PTPRD phosphatase was diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer. 10 μL of this solution was added to each well, and the optical density was measured in 1 minute intervals at 405 nm using a Spectromax spectrophotometer For peptide competition assays, final peptide concentrations were 4 × 10−4 M.

2.5 Flavonoids:

Quercetin and rhamnazin (≥95% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis MO). Rhamnetin, luteolin, cyanidin, kaempferol, myricetin (all ≥98% purity) and fisetin ( ≥90% purity) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor MI) and used without further purification in screening (10−4M) and kinetic (0, 5, 10, 50 and 100 10−6M) experiments.

2.6 Peptide and quercetin docking:

Dephospho GSK3 peptides were docked to PTPRD (PDB ID 2NV5 (23)) using FlexPepDock and an ab-initio protocol that folds the peptide as it docks (24). A library of 3, 5 and 9-amino acid backbone fragments was generated, a linear peptide superimposed near the active site and the complex prepacked. 100,000 models were generated as described (24). Docked models were discarded if the tyrosine was not oriented for catalysis as in the structure of PTPRC bound to phosphopeptide substrate (PDB ID 1YGR (25). Models were thus discarded if the hydroxyl oxygen was more than 6Å away from the catalytic cysteine or if the gamma carbon was more than 2Å from the gamma carbon of the phosphotyrosine bound to PTPRC (after alignment to PTPRD). 100,000 models were generated for each substrate. 712 GSK3 models satisfied the reweighted_sc scoring term, as recommended for ab-initio docking. We added phosphates to the tyrosine in the top scoring pose for each peptide orientation. We then docked the phosphopeptide and generated 1,100 models using the FlexPepDock refinement protocol (26).

Quercetin was docked to the PTPRD phosphatase using a two-step process of global docking followed by extra-precision local docking. The model for PTPRD’s phosphatase was prepared for docking by adding hydrogens, assigning protonation states and optimizing hydrogen bonds using the Schrodinger Protein Preparation Wizard (27, 28). Quercetin was prepared using LigPrep to enumerate protonation and tautomerization states and to generate an initial 3D structure. Global docking used Autodock Vina (29), a grid that fully encompassed PTPRD and 1,000 independent docking runs, providing an exhaustiveness parameter of 16. All of the top 1,000 scoring poses were confined to three sites or the catalytically-active phosphatase site. Thus, local docking was performed at these three sites using the Glide program/extra precision (XP) protocol (27, 30, 31). Docked models were inspected for interactions that could explain the observed structure-activity relationships.

3. Results

3.1 PTPPeps identified in C. elegans:

We note that a) PTPPeps expressed at higher levels in worms with knockout of its PTPRD homolog ptp-3 (12) include a shared sequence that surrounds phosphotyrosines (pY) 279 in GSK3α and pY216 in GSK3β and a sequence that surrounds pY15 in CDK5 (Table 1); b) each of these tyrosine phosphorylations can alter the activities of these tyrosine kinases (33) (34–37) and c) each of these tyrosine kinases can phosphorylate tau, a principal component of Alzheimer’s disease neurofibrillary pathology (38).

PTPRD’s phosphatase liberates orthophosphate from both GSK3 and CDK5 phosphopeptides at rates (Fig 1) much greater than those (essentially zero) for control experiments using boiled/ inactivated phosphatase. Each of these phosphopeptides also competes for PTPRD phosphatase’s hydrolysis of the generic nonpeptide phosphatase substrate paranitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP)

There is evidence for specificity. Dephospho GSK3β/GSK3α and CDK5 peptides are inactive in competing for pNPP hydrolysis by PTPRD. Mutant pY15CDK5 PTPPeps display structure activity relationships that agree with previously-reported data for PTPRD’s phosphatase (2) (Fig 2). Dephosphorylation rates are lower when alanine is substituted for glutamic acid and higher when alanine is substituted for lysine. pYGSK3 PTPPep dephosphorylation by PTPRD’s phosphatase is more robust vs the generic positive control substrate END(pY)INASL (39) than dephosphorylation by either of the closely-related phosphatases, PTPRS or PTPRF (Fig 3).

3.2 Increased pYGSK3β and α in PTPRD knockout brains:

Western analyses using antibodies that specifically recognize these brain PTPPeps evaluated differences in pY216 GSK3β, pY279 GSK3α and pY15 CDK5 in brains of mice with reduced PTPRD expression. Heterozygous knockout mice displayed more pY279 GSK3α and pY216 GSK3β immunoreactivities (1.29 and 1.15-fold (p = 0.001 and 0.05) (Fig 4), though there was no increase in pY15 CDK5 immunoreactivity. GSK3α and pYGSK3β are both coexpressed with PTPRD in human cortical neuronal subtypes (40). They are thus “third stage” candidate neuronal substrates for PTPRD.

3.3 Identification of PTPPs with increased abundance in brains of mice with reduced PTPRD expression:

We used phosphoproteomic studies of brains of wildtype vs heterozygous knockout mice to further enhance our understanding of brain substrates for PTPRD. These studies identified 76 gene products (or groups of related products) that were identified by 101 brain PTPPeps that displayed ≥ 1.9-fold increased abundance with p &lt; 0.05 in knockouts (Table 2).

3.4 Phosphotyrosine phosphopeptides from stage 1 share expression with PTPRD:

All but 9 of these gene produces are coexpressed with PTPRD in mouse cortical and hippocampal neuronal single cell RNAseq datasets. From these and phosphoproteomic data from others (12, 41), we assembled a list of 128 “second stage” candidate PTPRD substrates (Table 3).

3.5 Identifying the “third stage” PTPP candidates from which PTPRD phosphatase briskly liberates orthophosphate:

We examined rates at which recombinant PTPRD phosphatase dephosphorylated synthetic PTPPeps corresponding to these 128 “second stage” candidate PTPRD substrates. Eighty nine provided “third stage” PTPPeps since they were dephosphorylated at rates ≥ 15% of rates for our positive control PTPPep END(pY)INASL (Fig 5, Table 4).

3.6 Identification of quercetin as a PTPRD PAM for orthophosphate release from pYGSK3α/β PTPPep:

We obtained surprising results when we screened activities of a number of flavonoids at PTPRD’s phosphatase, following reports that scutellarin inhibited a close PTPRD relative, PTPRS (42). Several flavonols increased rates of dephosphorylation of our pYGSK3α/β PTPPep (Fig 6). This stimulation of PTPRD dephosphorylation of pYGSK3α/β PTPPep was not accompanied by stimulation of PTPRD’s dephosphorylation of the synthetic phosphatase substrate pNPP. When normalized to rates of dephosphorylation of END(pY)INASL, the effect of quercetin was at least as prominent at PTPRD as it was at PTPRF or PTPRS (Fig 7).

There was evidence for a selective structure activity relationship (Fig 6). There was significant positive allosteric modulation by the quercetin-related flavonols myricetin and fisetin. However, there was no positive allosteric modulation of PTPRD phosphatase activities in dephosphorylating GSK3 by structures that removed quercetin’s 3- or 5-position hydroxyls (luteolin, kampferol), deleted both its 3’ and 4’ hydroxyls (galangin), removed its 4 position keto (cyanadin) or methylated its 3’ and/or 7 position hydroxyls (rhamnetin, rhamnazin). There was no stimulation of PTPRD phosphatase by any of more than 70 small molecules with structures related to our PTPRD phosphatase inhibitors 7-BIA or NHB-1109 (22)(43).

3.7 Identification of the substrate selectivity of quercetin as a PTPRD PAM:

PAM activities of quercetin differed for different candidate PTPRD substrates. Quercetin stimulated dephosphorylation of our pYGSK3α/β PTPPep by 1.77 +/− 0.08 fold in the 27 experiments that provided positive control data for studies of other candidate substrates. Other candidate substrates displayed ratios of activities with vs without 10−4M quercetin that ranged from substantial enhancement (positive allosteric modulators) to substantial inhibition (Fig 8, Table 5). Orthophosphate release from 39 of the 89 tested synthetic PTPPeps displayed nominally-significant increases when 10−4 M quercetin was included in assays. Substrates that were dephosphorylated more slowly in quercetin’s absence displayed more quercetin positive allosteric modulation than those that were dephosphorylated more rapidly without quercetin (ρ = − 0.74, p = 3 × 10−5 for correlation between rank orders of rate of dephosphorylation at baseline vs fold stimulation by quercetin).

3.8 An initial in silico model for substrate selective quercetin PAM activity at PTPRD:

In silico docking results supported specific interactions between PTPRD’s phosphatase and quercetin. Docking quercetin to PTPRD’s phosphatase identified a candidate allosteric binding site for quercetin that provided good −6.2 kcal/mol calculated binding energy (Fig 9). Quercetin’s 3-hydroxyl contributed two hydrogen bonds to its interaction with this site, consistent with observed greater activity for quercetin than for the flavones that lack this hydroxyl.

pY GSK3β/GSK3α PTPPep can dock with PTPRD’s phosphatase in silico in both “equatorial” and “axial” modes (520 vs 507 Rosetta energy units, respectively, Fig 10). This preference for equatorial binding of GSK3 phosphopeptide in the absence of flavonols fit with our observed results if equatorial binding led to less efficient dephosphorylation and if quercetin shifted GSK3β/GSK3α PTPPep binding toward “axial” modes that were more rapidly dephosphorylated. In fact, equatorial binding has been found to lead to less efficient dephosphorylation than axial binding for PTP1C’s phosphatase (44).

4. Discussion

4.1 PTPRD substrate identification:

We document a range of well-supported candidate physiological brain substrates for PTPRD’s phosphatase. Phosphotyrosine phosphoproteomic (PTPPomic) methods have been used to aid identification of PTPPs whose abundance is changed with reduced expression of other tyrosine phosphatases, including PTPRB (45), PTPRG (46), PTPN11 (47, 48) and PTP4A3 (49). Our work adds appreciably to the growing number of substrates identified for specific protein tyrosine phosphatases.

There are strengths and indications of validity in this data. There is significant overlap (hyper-geometric p = 10−9) between our phosphoproteomic results and those reported in studies of a different strain of PTPRD knockout mice as our work was in progress (41). There is overlap with the set of genes identified with increased tyrosine phosphorylation in C. elegans with knockout of its PTPRD analog ptp-3 (hypergeometric p = 9 × 10−5) (12).

There is biological plausibility. Gene ontology (GO) results for our list of phase 2 candidate substrates identify “protein peptidyl-tyrosine modification, phosphorylation, cell surface receptor signaling and transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling” with false-discovery rate corrected p values &lt; 2 × 10−4. In the smaller set of the PTPPs whose dephosphorylation is increased by quercetin, there are p &lt; 0.01 results for GO terms including “phosphate-containing compound metabolic process, maintenance of postsynaptic specialization structure, postsynaptic density organization, postsynaptic specialization organization and maintenance of synapse structure”. There is also biological plausibility for adaptations for loss of PTPRD among the set of PTPPs whose abundance is decreased in knockout brains (Table 6). These gene set annotations can be readily related to features of PTPD’s likely synaptic neurobiology (4).

The work also has limitations. Western results such as those that confirm PTPRD-dependent differences in pYGSK3α and β phosphorylation in vivo herein are limited by the modest numbers of antibodies that recognize specific phosphotyrosine PTPPs. The quantitative PTPPomic mass spectrographic identification of proteolytic fragments used here resolves many brain PTPPeps but does not identify them all (16). The sequence similarities surrounding phosphotyrosines in several of the PTPPs identified here provide ambiguity concerning which gene products actually display increased abundance in brains of mice with reduced PTPRD expression. Phosphorylation levels can be labile, adding noise to studies (50). Our results do not separate differences in levels of expression of these PTPPs from differences in the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins.

4.2 PTPRD substrate-selective positive allosteric modulation:

The structure-activity relationships for flavonoid positive allosteric modulation of PTPRD’s phosphatase and our in silico docking results both support substantial specificity. Together, these provide candidate molecular bases for PTPRD phosphatase’s apparently-specific interactions with pYGSK3 PTPPeps and with flavonols. Quercetin bound to its novel PAM site on PTPRD’s phosphatase could shift phosphopeptide binding away from the catalytically-unfavored equatorial and toward more catalytically-favored axial binding, providing the observed positive allosteric modulation of PTPRD’s phosphatase activity (Fig 10). Further work will be required to test this working model for quercetin binding to and substrate-selective positive allosteric modulation of PTPRD’s phosphatase.

4.3 Fits between current data and recent genetic and environmental findings in Alzheimer’s disease:

Our results and other data support PTPRD actions in downregulating the serine/threonine kinase activities of GSK3β and GSK3α by increasing dephosphorylation of their regulatory phosphotyrosines 216 and 279, respectively (33) (34–37). Quercetin increases this downregulatory activity.

GSK3β and GSK3α are some of the most prominent phosphorylators of tau (38). Hyper-phosphorylated tau is the major constituent of the neurofibrillary tangles that provide a key component of Alzheimer’s disease pathology (38). Both PTPRD activities on regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation of GSK3β and GSK3α and changes in this PTPRD activity with flavonols each fit with recent findings in AD. First, PTPRD genomic markers are associated with both individual differences in neurofibrillary tangle densities in AD brains (7) and with individual differences in levels of PTPRD mRNA expression in postmortem human cerebral cortex (11). Secondly, studies of dietary influences identify high consumption of flavonols as a major factor protecting against progression to AD (51–56), with no corresponding effect of flavones. We note that efforts to assess effects of intake of quercetin alone in the smaller study found a numerical reduction in AD incidence that did not reach statistical significance (57).

4.4 Conclusions:

Our findings that quercetin and related flavonols provide positive allosteric modulation of PTPRD phosphatase’s activities in dephosphorylating GSK3s can thus be linked to AD-related genetic and environmental variables (and to findings in mouse models of AD (58–61)). Identifying the substrates for additional PTPs and understanding the significance of these substrates’ dephosphorylation will likely provide additional improvements in understanding of phosphatases’ physiological and pathological roles and additional clues to novel therapeutic approaches.

Significance Statement

Normal and pathological cell functions can be regulated by the rates of phosphorylation (tyrosine kinases) and dephosphorylation (tyrosine phosphatases) of selected phosphoproteins. We now identify brain phosphoprotein substrates for PTPRD, an abundantly expressed neuronal tyrosine phosphatase. Flavonols (but not closely related flavonones) increase PTPRD’s cleavage of phosphate from phosphotyrosines in some of these substrates. Such substrate specificity of positive allosteric modulation has not been clearly elucidated previously. Flavonol-mediated increases in PTPRD’s dephosphorylation of the GSK3 β and α kinases that hyperphosphorylate tau could link prior findings that high flavonol intake reduces incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and that common human PTPRD genomic variants are associated with densities of phospho-tau rich neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains.
