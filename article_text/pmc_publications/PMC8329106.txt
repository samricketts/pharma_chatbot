Imagining an event from a personal perspective has been found to be able to enhance memory for words and sentences for healthy younger adults and brain-injured patients. However, little is known about how people with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) respond to self-imagination, in comparison to healthy older adults. The current study addresses this gap in the literature. Participants viewed images of objects and were asked to either imagine in rich detail buying each object in a store (the self-imagination condition) or decide whether it can fit in an average shoe box (the control condition). Our results revealed that self-imagination shows a mnemonic advantage over the control strategy, though this pattern emerged more clearly for healthy older adults. Furthermore, suggestive evidence indicates that cognitive ability, as assessed through performance on a neuropsychological battery, supports self-reference benefits for healthy older adults, but not aMCI patients. These findings extended previous research to reveal the effectiveness of self-imagination for older adults using pictorial stimuli and supported the viewpoint that aMCI could qualitatively change the way that cognitive resources are engaged.

pmcRelating information to the self robustly facilitates memory (Rogers, Kuiper, &amp; Kirker, 1977; Symons &amp; Johnson, 1997). This phenomenon, known as the self-reference effect, results from the elaborative processing and deeper-level organization of information activated when information is self-relevant (Klein &amp; Loftus, 1988; Kuiper &amp; Rogers, 1979). Self-imagination is one approach that operates by mobilizing and integrating cognitive processes such as visual and spatial imagery, semantic retrieval, and self-referential processes, making the imagined event more elaborative and thus more memorable (Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2010). Depending on the memory target, self-imagination can take different forms, ranging from object-location pairs to future goals (prospective memory). Moreover, self-imagination has been shown to benefit performance on a broad range of tasks for many populations, including healthy younger and older adults (Hou, Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2019) as well as clinical populations, including patients with schizophrenia (Raffard et al., 2016) and memory impairments caused by neurological damage such as TBI (Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2010; Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2011; Grilli &amp; McFarland, 2011; Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2013).

The first aim of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of a self-imagination strategy in healthy older adults, seeking to replicate the findings of Hou, Grill, &amp; Glisky (2019), but using a paradigm with images instead of verbal cues. Unlike many cognitive functions that decline with age, the ability to think about the self and benefit mnemonically from self-referencing seems to be relatively intact in older adults (Glisky &amp; Marquine, 2009; Gutchess, Kensinger, &amp; Schacter, 2010; Gutchess, Kensinger, Yoon, &amp; Schacter, 2007; Hamami, Serbun, &amp; Gutchess, 2011; Mueller, Wonderlich, &amp; Dugan, 1986; Rogers, Kuiper, &amp; Kirker, 1977). Initial studies of self-imagination (e.g., Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2010; Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2011; Grilli &amp; McFarland, 2011; Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2013) focused on patient groups with healthy adults drawn from broad age ranges as comparisons. Recent studies (Hou, Grill, &amp; Glisky, 2019) have begun to investigate the effectiveness of the strategy in older adults in their own right, establishing that self-imagination benefits younger and older adults’ memory performance on a verbal object-location associative memory tasks compared to a sentence generation task. For source memory, however, self-referencing benefitted older adults’ performance compared to other-referencing, but performance did not significantly differ between self-imagination and sentence generation conditions. Similarly, self-imagination enhanced younger and older adults’ memory for high-likelihood person-object and object-location word pairs compared to the other-imagined condition (Hou, Grilli, &amp; Glisky, 2019). In the present study, we extended the study of self-imagination in older adults by assessing memory for pictures, contrasting the focus on verbal stimuli in research thus far. Pictures are used in this is study because research on mental imagery has found that the presence of images can increase the likelihood of benefiting from such technique for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and potentially amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).

From the literature thus far, it remains unclear how a self-imagination strategy would impact patients with memory deficits resulting from age-related neurodegenerative disease rather than brain injury or schizophrenia. The second aim of this study focuses on patients with aMCI by comparing their response to self-imagination to that of a control group of healthy older adults. MCI is characterized by the emergence of cognitive symptoms and abnormal test scores but the absence of dementia because function is normal (Petersen, 2004). Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is a type of MCI that features loss of memory, usually reflecting pathophysiological changes in the medial temporal lobes consistent with later development of clinical AD (Albert et al., 2011). Thus, although aMCI can be considered a precursor of AD dementia, not every patient with aMCI develops AD dementia. The perseverance of self-construal and changes in autobiographical memory in patients with aMCI have generated substantial research interest. Some studies demonstrate that patients with aMCI and AD have a maintained sense of self, such that they would use personal pronouns as often as healthy older adults and can recognize themselves from photographs (Fazio &amp; Mitchell, 2009). But as the disease progresses, it might become increasingly difficult to maintain a well-integrated autobiographical memory (Conway, 2005; Prebble, Addis, &amp; Tippett, 2013) which ultimately impairs the sense of self (Caddell &amp; Clare, 2010; Clare, 2003; Fargeau et al., 2010). Whereas patients with hippocampal damage resulting in amnesia had difficulty imagining the self (Hassabis et al., 2007; Tulving, 1985), this may reflect the fact that the self-imagination elicited in earlier studies relied heavily on episodic retrieval of autobiographical information (e.g., “imagine oneself in a familiar place”), which would pose more difficulty for amnestic patients with focal damage in hippocampus (Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2010).

In terms of mnemonic strategies, evidence of the effectiveness of self-referencing in aMCI patients thus far has been mixed. A recent study found that aMCI patients, like their healthy older counterparts, exhibited improved memory for words judged on self-descriptiveness, but that combining those judgments with autobiographical recall of one’s personal past increased memory errors (Zhang, Johndro, Budson &amp; Gutchess, 2020). In contrast, Rosa and colleagues (2015) found no improvement following self-referencing; they discovered that patients with aMCI did not show any self-reference advantage when judging a trait adjective based on its self-descriptiveness compared to commonness. Other research demonstrated that self-referencing works for patients with aMCI or AD, but only under certain circumstances. For example, self-referencing enhanced item memory more than source memory (Rosa et al., 2016) and was more effective for positive (Leblond et al., 2016) and negative traits (Kalenzaga &amp; Clarys, 2013; Kalenzaga, Bugaïska, &amp; Clarys, 2013), compared to neutral ones. In terms of the size of such benefit compare to other strategies, Carson and colleagues (2018) revealed that self-descriptiveness judgment could improve memory in comparison to the baseline structural condition (“does the word contain a specific letter?”) but not beyond the semantic condition (“is this trait desirable?”).

Similar to the mixed behavioral evidence for the effectiveness of self-referencing with aMCI, the neural evidence is also mixed. Compared to healthy older adults, atrophy of medial temporal regions is more pronounced in aMCI patients and further progresses with AD (Csernansky et al., 2004; De Leon et al., 1997; Jack et al., 1997; Johnson, Fox, Sperling, &amp; Klunk, 2012; Schröder &amp; Pantel, 2016). However, self-related thinking is primarily mediated by cortical midline structures such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; Macrae, Moran, Heatherton, Banfield, &amp; Kelly, 2004; Gutchess, Kensinger, &amp; Schacter, 2007; Gutchess et al., 2015). This dissociation between regions allows for the possibility that self-referencing could benefit aMCI patients because the strategy relies on regions less vulnerable to effects of age and neurodegeneration. However, other studies suggest that the story might be more complicated. Genon et al. (2014) discovered that while both healthy older adults and patients with AD activated the mPFC when making self-referential judgments, patients failed to show benefits to memory, as a result of reduced grey matter density in lateral prefrontal cortex. Considering patients’ preserved sense of self, this line of evidence raises the possibility that the reduction of self-reference effects in patients with aMCI and AD could be attributable to a deteriorated higher-order process linking self and memory rather than the ability to conduct self-relevant thinking per se. Similarly, hippocampal damage could impair episodic retrieval related to the self, hindering patients’ ability to form robust mental images (Grilli &amp; Glisky, 2010). Taken together, neural evidence suggests that although self-referencing engages regions that are less affected by aMCI/AD, it does not guarantee the effectiveness of self-referencing; it is even less certain with self-imagination specifically, due to its potentially greater reliance on hippocampus.

In terms of research focused on the effects of AD on the ability to generate mental images, integral to successful self-imagination, some studies indicate impairments to some aspects of mental imagery (Hussey et al., 2012; El Haj, Gallouj, &amp; Antoine, 2019). Although patients with AD perform as well as healthy older adults in basic generation and inspection of a visual image (e.g., imagining an object and determining whether it is taller than it is wider), they were impaired on more complex procedure such as spatial transformation and semantic-episodic retrieval (e.g., imagine an animal and determine whether its tail is longer than its body). This type of complex imagery and manipulation may form the basis of self-referential imagination (Hussey et al., 2012) or any kinds of autobiographical retrieval (El Haj, Gallouj, &amp; Antoine, 2019). Along the same lines, Hussey and colleagues (2012) found that patients with AD were not able to benefit from self-referential imagery that asked them to imagine interacting with items shown as words on the screen. Interestingly, when a perceptual cue depicting the items was provided, patients performed equivalently to healthy older adults (both close to ceiling). This could imply that even though impairments in patients with AD hindered them from re-constructing autobiographical scenes or picturing the self interacting with the objects, visual cues and guidance on the content to be imagined could make the procedure less challenging by removing some of the burden on semantic-episodic retrieval. Considering that the self-referential imagery task in Hussey et al. (2012) used words only and provided no further guidance on what types of scenes to imagine, cognitively impaired patients may be able to benefit from self-imagination in a visually rich and guided task. We assess this possibility in the current study.

Based on the prior literature, we had two possible hypotheses regarding the effects of aMCI. One is that aMCI patients would not be able to benefit from self-imagination, or at least not as much as their healthy older counterparts. This is based on the fact the TBI patients who showed improvement mostly had more diffuse frontal/temporal damage and less hippocampal-focused impairment. In contrast, the medial temporal decline in aMCI and AD may impair self-imagination. In addition, research on mental imagery suggests that autobiographical imagination is challenging for AD patients due to its inherent reliance on semantic-episodic retrieval, a concern that may extend to the aMCI population. The other candidate hypothesis is that self-imagination benefits may extend to aMCI patients. This is based on the evidence for some effectiveness of self-referencing and mental imagery in aMCI patients; we will leverage visual components by using pictures as stimuli in an attempt to enhance elaboration.

In addition, we manipulate the relatedness of the lure items in the task, with some being highly similar to the studied items (e.g., a different exemplar of a bicycle) and some being new, or unrelated to the studied items. This manipulation is intended both to increase the difficulty of the task, based on the high level of performance of pilot control participants when only new lures were used, as well as to test the effectiveness of a self-imagination strategy on tasks varying in the importance of visual detail. Although patients with aMCI or Alzheimer’s disease tend to have higher false alarm rates than healthy older adults, this is not necessarily the case for materials that are related to study items (e.g., Balota et al., 1999; Budson, Daffner, Desikan, &amp; Schacter, 2000). Thus, it is possible that effects of self-imagination could differentially impact memory for similar versus new items across the groups.

Method

Participants

We tested 41 healthy older adults, and 26 aMCI patients1. One healthy older adult was excluded due to imagination success rate lower than 50%, resulting in a sample with 40 healthy older adults and 26 aMCI patients. Healthy older adults were recruited from the greater Boston area and patients were recruited through the Center for Translational Cognitive Neuroscience at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare System. Patients were assessed by a neurologist (AEB) in the VA Boston Memory Disorders Clinic and received a clinical diagnosis of MCI likely due to the AD pathophysiologic process (Albert et al., 2011) based upon their history, cognitive complaints, and test results. All patients scored at least 1 SD below the mean on the tests of episodic memory (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease [CERAD] word list memory task, Morris et al., 1989). See Table 1 for the performance of each group on the neuropsychological battery and demographics. Healthy older adults had no cognitive complaints and scored within the normal range on all cognitive tests. Healthy older adults participated in the lab at Brandeis and aMCI patients were primarily tested in their homes. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of participating institutions.

Procedure

After providing written informed consent, participants completed a computer-based task with photos of items displayed one at a time. Trials were assigned to one of two conditions: 1) the “self-imagination” condition, in which the participants imagined buying an item in a store, 2) the control condition, in which the participants decided whether an item could be fit into an average shoebox (condition adapted from Gonsalves &amp; Paller, 2000; Kensinger &amp; Schacter; 2005; Kensinger, Garoff-Eaton, &amp; Schacter, 2006). The control condition was chosen to evoke relatively shallow processing of the appearance of the object, but without establishing self-relevance.

For the stimuli, pairs of objects were selected to include similar lures, in order to increase task difficulty. 108 object pairs were drawn from a bank of 180 object pairs rated for shared names, familiarity, and conceptual agreement (Millar et al., 2013). The two photos in a particular pair shared the same semantic label but differed in visual details (e.g., color, orientation, or number). Twelve counterbalancing conditions were created a priori to allow for different groups of objects to be presented in the “same”, “similar”, or “new” condition across participants (more details about these labels below).

During encoding, ninety objects (45 objects in each condition) were presented for six seconds in a random order unique to each participant. In each encoding trial, an item appeared with instruction at the top of the screen stating either “imagine yourself buying this item in a store” (the self-imagination condition) or “think about whether this item would fit in a shoebox” (the control condition). Participants did not need to press any buttons. Before starting, the participants completed two practice trials, one on each scenario, in which the experimenter discussed vividly imagining how one would experience the scenarios in as much detail as possible. Participants rephrased what they had to do after seeing the instructions, in order to make sure that they understood the different conditions.

After studying all 90 items, the participants completed a questionnaire assessing what proportion of the trials did they successfully imaged in each condition. Ten options were offered as ranges of percentage, from 0–10% to 91–100%. (participants who reported success rates &lt; 50% were excluded from the analyses). They then had a retention interval of 15 minutes, during which they completed a demographic questionnaire, a health questionnaire, and maze games.

The retrieval phase was self-paced. Participants viewed 108 pictures presented in a random order, with 54 “same” items (i.e., exact same picture that had been studied; 27 in each of the self-imagination and control conditions), 36 “similar” items (i.e., the item matched the verbal label of the studied object but differed in visual details; 18 in each condition), and 18 “new” items (objects unrelated to those studied). To indicate both their old/new judgement and their confidence level, participants provided a confidence rating on a 1–6 scale with 1–3 representing “old” judgments, and 4–6 representing “new” judgments. Because not all participants used each response label and the frequencies of using 1 and 6 were extremely low, the present analyses focus on old/new judgments only. Participants were instructed that only items that were exactly the same as those shown in the encoding session were to be called old. If an item differed in any way from the original, or if it was a completely new item, it should be called “new”.

Following the self-imagination task, participants completed a series of neuropsychological tests, including the mini mental state exam (MMSE2; Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975), CERAD word memory task (Morris et al., 1989), trail making, word fluency (Monsch et al., 1992), Boston Naming Test (Mack, Freed, Williams, &amp; Henderson, 1992), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; Sheikh &amp; Yesavage, 1986). These tests were used to characterize samples and recruit appropriate participants (e.g., MMSE scores are usually between 27 and 30 for older controls, but lower than 27 for aMCI patients; Reisberg et al., 2010). Measures were also used to match participants on demographic variables (see supplemental materials).

Results

We first analyzed corrected recognition scores and then separately analyzed false alarm rates. We adopted this approach because our task involved two different types of false positives: similar items called “old” and new items called “old”, analyses were conducted separately for the corrected recognition rates based on two types of false alarms. Within each analysis, we first presented the results for older adult controls, in order to test for the benefit of self-imagination on memory with aging, and then present the comparisons with aMCI patients, in order to test the effectiveness of a self-imagination strategy with this patient group.

Imagination Success Rates

A 2 (group: aMCI vs. healthy OAs) × 2 (condition: self vs. control) ANOVA showed no significant main or interaction effects, ps &gt; .55. The imagination success rates do not differ between the self-imagination condition and the control condition for either healthy older adults (Mself = 85.00 vs. Mcontrol = 86.50), t (40) = .65, p = .52, or aMCI patients (Mself = 85.38 vs. Mcontrol = 86.15), t (25) = .26, p = .80.

Corrected Recognition Scores

To compute corrected recognition scores, false alarms rates to the similar items (corrected recognition-similar) or the new items (corrected recognition-new) were subtracted from the hit rate. These scores were tested in separate analyses because they are not independent, as they incorporate the same hit rate.

To test whether healthy older adults showed an improvement from self-imagination, we first compared corrected recognition scores in this condition to the control condition, using the false alarm rate to similar items. We found that self-imagination (M = .71) yielded better memory than the control condition (M = .66), t (39) = 2.41, p = .02. For the corrected recognition scores using the false alarm rate to new items, self-imagination (M = .86) yielded marginally better memory than the control condition (M = .82), t (39) = 2.00, p = .05.

To compare the effectiveness of the self-imagination strategy with aMCI, we conducted two 2 (group: aMCI vs. healthy OAs) × 2 (condition: Self vs. Control) mixed factorial ANOVA on each of the corrected recognition measures, using false alarms to similar and new items. For similar corrected recognition scores, there was a main effect of group, F (1,64) = 16.34, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .20, such that healthy older adults (M = .68) performed better than aMCI patients (M = .49). No other significant effects were found, ps &gt; .32. In contrast to older adults’ higher performance in the self-imagination condition relative to the control condition, this difference was not significant in aMCI patients when tested on their own, t (25) = .28, p = .78. See Figure 1 for a depiction of corrected recognition-similar performance by groups and conditions. Results for corrected recognition-new scores showed similar pattern: there was a main effect of group, F(1,64) = 11.74, p = .001, ηp2 = .16, such that healthy older adults (M = .84) performed better than aMCI patients (M = .67) but no other significant effects were found, ps &gt; .30. Although older adults exhibited marginally higher performance in the self-imagination condition relative to the control condition, this was not true for aMCI patients when tested alone, t (25) = .22, p = .83. See Figure 2 for a depiction of corrected recognition-new performance by groups and conditions.

Exploratory Comparison of Similar vs. New Items

To explore whether self-imagination improve memory for specific details (i.e., the size of self-imagination benefit is larger if using similar vs. new items), we compared the size of self-imagination effect based on similar and new false alarms for the two participant groups. First, the difference between corrected recognition for self and control condition was calculated using similar and new false alarms respectively. Then, a 2 (group: aMCI vs. healthy OAs) × 2 (self-imagination advantage based on similar vs. new false alarms) mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted. There are no main or interaction effects, ps &gt; .22, suggesting that self-imagination effect is not greater for similar vs. new items and that there was no evidence for a difference between healthy older adults and aMCI patients.

False Alarms

The two types of false alarm rates (similar false alarms—similar lures incorrectly called “old”, and new false alarms—new items incorrectly called “old”) were analyzed separately; this is because the comparison of self vs. control can only be conducted for the similar condition.

Healthy older adults did not differ in their tendency to commit false alarms to similar items in the self vs. control conditions, t (39) = 1.21, p = .23. To compare healthy older adults and aMCI patients, a 2 (group: aMCI vs. healthy OAs) × 2 (condition: self vs. control) mixed factorial ANOVA was conducted. There is a main effect of group, such that for similar items, aMCI patients (M = .29) committed more false alarms than healthy older adults (M = .19), F(1,64) = 11.42, p = .001, ηp2 = .15. No other effects were significant, ps &gt; .23.

For false alarms to new items (new objects incorrectly called “old”), a between-group (aMCI vs. healthy OAs) t-test was conducted because there is only one pool of “new” items. That is, because they were, by definition, not presented at encoding, the new items did not correspond to the self or control conditions at encoding. An independent sample t-test conducted on false alarms to new items showed that aMCI patients (M = .11) committed more false alarms than healthy controls (M = .04), t (64) = .26, p =.01.

Correlations with Neuropsychological Measures

According to our results, as shown in Figure 1 and 2, our aMCI group varied substantially in their memory performance. We sought to better understand the variability by considering neuropsychological test performance. Because patients varied in the severity of their memory impairment, could it be the case that aMCI patients who experience less cognitive decline benefit more from self-imagination?

The size of the self-imagination benefit was calculated by subtracting the corrected memory performance of control items from that of self-related items. This was done for both types of corrected memory: corrected recognition-similar, and corrected recognition-new. The two scores were combined into an averaged composite z-score for overall self-imagination benefit. Similarly, a composite z-score was generated averaging the z-scores for the nine neuropsychological tests (MMSE, CERAD-Immediate, CERAD-Delayed, CERAD-Recognition, Trail Making-A, Trail Making-B, FAS, CAT, BNT). One aMCI participant was removed as an outlier (self-imagination score &gt; 5). The composite scores for overall self-imagination benefit and neuropsychological test performance were created in order to reduce the number of comparisons and to have more robust measures of performance, given that the two memory measures showed similar patterns in previous analyses. In order to examine whether the size of self-imagination benefit in aMCI patients is related to the degree of cognitive impairment, we correlated memory performance on the self-imagination tasks with overall performance on neuropsychological tests. Considering the relationship separately for each group, the relationship is negative, but not significant, for aMCI patients, r (23) = −.23, p = .27. For healthy OAs, the correlation is positive and trended toward significance, r (38) = .28, p = .08. To test the difference between the correlation values of the two groups (as the tests reported for each group compare whether the correlation is significantly different from zero), we used a Fisher r-to-z transformation. Results indicate a marginal difference between the groups, z = 1.94, p = .05 (two-tailed). See Figure 3 for scatterplots and the fitted linear trend for both groups.

In an attempt to examine whether the diminished self-imagination benefit is associated with reduced episodic long-term memory capability particularly, we also tested the correlation between the z-transformed CERAD-Delayed score and the composite z-score for overall self-imagination benefit. Healthy older adults showed a significant positive correlation between the two measures, r (38) = .39, p = .01, but this is not true for aMCI patients, r (23) = −.29, p = .15. The comparison between the two correlations was also significantly different, z = 2.64, p = .004.

Discussion

The current study sought to investigate the effect of self-imagination as a potential strategy to improve memory for objects in both healthy older controls and aMCI patients. The results revealed a mnemonic advantage for self-imagination over the non-self-related control strategy for the healthy older adults, but not for the aMCI patients. This finding converged with previous studies showing the benefit of self-imagination in healthy older adults (Hou, Grilli, &amp; Glisky, 2019), extending evidence for the effectiveness of the strategy to item memory for pictures, including visually similar stimuli.

The aMCI patients did not exhibit a clear effect of self-imagination. This pattern may reflect the variability in the aMCI group; considering the contribution of cognitive resources to the self-imagination strategy provided some evidence that cognitive resources were important to consider in the ability to benefit from the mnemonic strategy. More intriguingly, however, was suggestive evidence that cognitive resources may contribute differently to self-imagination benefits for healthy control participants than for patients with aMCI. Healthy older adults who scored higher on a battery of neuropsychological tests, particularly the test of long-term memory, tended to exhibit a larger memory advantage for the self-imagination trials compared to the control trials. This is consistent with prior evidence indicating that cognitive resources support the ability to effectively use mnemonic strategies (Kirchhoff, Gordon, &amp; Head, 2014; Kuhlmann &amp; Touron, 2016). However, aMCI patients show no such relationship. Interestingly, Hou et al. (2019) reported a negative relationship between self-reference effects and scores of medial temporal function in a group of healthy older adults. The difference between groups in our study, the lack of a positive relationship for aMCI patients between cognitive resources and mnemonic benefits from self-referencing, as well as the evidence from Hou et al. (2019), are in line with some of the literature indicating separable neural substrates underlying self-reference effects on memory (e.g., Macrae et al., 2004; Gutchess et al., 2015; but see Genon et al., 2014). That is, self-reference effects may rely on abilities and neural substrates that are not assessed through typical neuropsychological batteries that measure abilities such as memory and executive function. Alternatively, aMCI/AD could induce qualitative changes in the processing of self-related information or the interaction between self and memory (Genon et al., 2014), that alter the way in which cognitive resources are engaged. As tantalizing as these suggestions are, we acknowledge the small sample sizes and borderline significance of the group difference; more research is needed with larger sample sizes as well employing neural measures that may be more sensitive to detecting individual differences in the integrity or functional engagement of neural regions.

Notably, the present results did not provide support for the effectiveness of a self-referencing strategy in aMCI patients, differing with another study from our lab with a largely overlapping sample of participants (Zhang, Johndro, Budson &amp; Gutchess, 2020). One reason why we demonstrated a self-referential benefit using the conventional adjective judgment paradigm (i.e., “does this word describe you?”) in the other study could be due to the previous paradigm relying less on episodic retrieval than the self-imagination task used here. In the current work, even though we had the participants imagine the everyday activity of buying items—a behavior we expected to be schematized and rely largely on semantic retrieval with less demand to retrieve episodic autobiographical memories—they might still engage such processes. For example, one might still have to recall the surrounding of the grocery store that they usually went to and rebuild that scenario during the task, which would trigger the retrieval of some episodic memory. Visual imagery may also be somewhat impoverished in aMCI patients, based on suggestions of disruption in some components of imagery (Hussey et al., 2012). Future work using a different control condition might allow for better distinction of the benefits of self-imagination compared to our mental imagery control condition, especially for aMCI patients. Although we selected the control task to match the self-imagination task on the imagery component, it is possible that it is not highly demanding of visual imagery to decide whether an object fits into a shoebox. Some items (e.g., a basketball) might call for the formation a mental image in order to make a decision, other items might need nothing more than semantic knowledge (e.g., a key). Even when visual imagery is required, it may not be as elaborated as imaging the scenario of shopping to purchase an object, as in the self-imagination condition. On the other hand, it is possible that participants infused the self into the imagery task (e.g., imagining the self trying to fit an item in a shoebox), reducing the uniqueness of the self-imagination task. To address these concerns, future studies could measure reaction time during encoding in order to evaluate the comparability of the demands of the conditions and assess how much time participants actually spend imagining the scenarios in each condition. Post-task questionnaires could be used to assess strategies and how participants completed the tasks.

Another factor that could contribute to the diminished self-referencing benefit in this study compared to the other research is the use of visual stimuli. Rather than serving to assist the aMCI patients with autobiographical retrieval as intended, it is possible that providing images could actually limit the amount of autobiographical information that patients could access. For example, when participants found the items were not desirable (i.e., something they would never buy in a store) or notably different from their personal items (e.g., that’s not my toothbrush), it could operate to restrict access to autobiographical retrieval processes associated with the self. In comparison, studies using words do not have this drawback because they allow for more flexibility for the participate to generate a personally meaningful and appropriate visual image.

Despite the potential to employ post-task questionnaires and ratings in future work to evaluate the possibilities discussed above, it is important to note the potential limitations to such measures. Although it is possible that diminished visual imagery ability or poor fit of visual items to the self could have caused the absence of self-imagination benefit in aMCI patients, their subjective judgments of their success using the imagination procedure were comparable to those of healthy older participants. That is, failures in using complicated visual imagery may not be detectable by the patients themselves.

Overall, the comparison between our patient and control group and between the current and previous results, as well as considering the broader literature on self-referencing, suggests that aMCI patients might be more likely to be able to benefit from some types of self-referencing strategies than others—perhaps not those that use strategies that rely on episodic retrieval about the self due to the reliance of this process on medial temporal regions. Future studies should consider these distinctions when developing potential interventions.

Figure 1. Corrected recognition-similar (corrected recognition: hits – similar false alarms) by groups and conditions. Healthy older adults exhibited a benefit from self-imagination compared to the control condition. In the comparison with aMCI patients, healthy older adults had higher corrected recognition scores overall compared to aMCI patients.

Figure 2. Corrected recognition-new (hits – new false alarms) by groups and conditions. Healthy older adults tend to benefit from self-imagination compared to the control condition. In the comparison with aMCI patients, healthy older adults had higher corrected recognition scores overall compared to aMCI patients.

Figure 3. Relationship between self-imagination benefit and cognitive ability. Whereas control participants who perform better on the battery of neuropsychological tests tend to receive a larger benefit from self-imagination compared to the control condition, the self-imagination benefit tends to be negatively related to performance on neuropsychological tests for aMCI patients.

1 Analyses were also conducted using a subsample of healthy controls matched to aMCIs on age and years of education. Results converged with the analyses reported here. See supplemental materials for details.

2 The MoCA was used in the clinic to diagnose individuals as having aMCI; the experimental paradigm used the MMSE to prevent administering the same measure close in time.
