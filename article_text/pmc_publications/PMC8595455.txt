pmcINTRODUCTION

Biomarkers of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) play a critical role in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies by identifying appropriate research participants and monitoring efficacy of treatment. Biomarkers are also important because they assist in identifying at-risk individuals who would benefit from anticipatory guidance and any future treatments. Widely accepted AD biomarkers based on cerebrospinal fluid analysis and imaging studies require expensive and invasive procedures that are not routinely performed (1). The search for sensitive, practical, and non-invasive markers of disease make visual measures an area of interest.

In recent decades, visual biomarkers have been examined in AD. Such studies were driven by visual changes in early disease and by evidence of AD pathology in vision-related structures of the brain and eye (2-4). Studies have found that patients with AD dementia have significantly impaired contrast sensitivity, color vision, visual attention, and saccadic eye movements compared to controls (5-7). Thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macula by optical coherence tomography (OCT) have also been observed in AD dementia patients compared to controls (8). Fewer studies evaluate these visual measures in prodromal AD, or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For some visual measures, it remains controversial whether these metrics have the capacity to differentiate patients with disease from controls at this stage (8, 9). Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the performance of new visual tests and reassess previously studied visual measures in MCI cohorts. In addition to disease detection, it is important to evaluate how visual measures correlate with vision-specific quality of life, a measure of patient experience, function, and well-being. More studies are needed to explore this topic, as vision-specific quality of life could potentially also inform disease status. Identifying visual changes that decrease quality of life would also inform caretakers on type of accommodations to best assist patients.

Rapid automatized naming (RAN) tests, although relatively unexplored in early AD, are vision-based tests that have been shown to detect concussion, multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson’s disease (10-12). RAN tests are timed and require quick and accurate identification and naming aloud of numbers or pictures. Accurate performance requires intact brain pathways involved in visual perception, color vision, object categorization, object-specific memory, eye movements and attention. These functions may be impaired in AD, increasing the potential sensitivity of these tests for detecting early stage disease. One study to date has investigated RAN test performance in AD and found that rapid number naming, in the form of the King-Devick test, differentiated AD dementia and MCI from controls (13). Our group has developed two RAN tests, neither of which have been studied in AD. The Mobile Universal Lexicon Evaluation System (MULES) is a rapid picture naming test composed of fruits, animals, and objects in context (10-12) and the Staggered Uneven Number (SUN) test is a newly developed rapid number naming test composed of numbers in zig-zag and horizontal patterns with unique spacing (14). The purpose of this investigation was to determine the capacity for new rapid picture and number naming tests and other measures of visual pathway structure and function to distinguish patients with MCI due to AD from those with normal aging and cognition. The relation of these tests to vision-specific quality of life scores was also examined in this pilot study.

METHODS

Study Participants

A convenience sample of participants who were 65 years of age or older, English-speaking, and had a diagnosis of MCI due to AD or normal cognition (control participants) was recruited from the NYU Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment. The diagnosis of MCI, with intermediate to high likelihood of AD as the etiology, was based on National Institute of Aging- Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) criteria (15). Diagnostic criteria included a Global Clinical Dementia Rating ® (CDR) score of 0.5, abnormal psychometric testing with amnestic pattern, and established AD biomarker assessment (neurodegeneration assessed by MRI or FDG PET-MRI, with a subset also having CSF amyloid/tau analysis or amyloid PET scan). Controls had a CDR score of 0 and no abnormalities on psychometric testing. Participants with severe psychiatric or neurological disease, including other types of dementias, were excluded. Individuals with comorbid ocular disease were not excluded to allow for more accurate representation of the population affected by Alzheimer’s disease, but ocular pathology was later accounted for in statistical analyses. All participants received a fifty-dollar gift card for their participation in the study. The study protocol, including study compensation, was approved by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine Institutional Review Board; all participants provided written informed consent.

Vision Testing

Vision testing was assessed monocularly and binocularly in controlled lighting with participants’ best distance correction. High-contrast or best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was evaluated with retro-illuminated Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts at a 3.2-meter distance. Low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) was determined using retro-illuminated Low-Contrast Sloan Letter Charts (Precision Vision, La Salle, IL) at both 2.5% and 1.25% contrast levels at a 2-meter distance. The numbers of letters identified correctly out of a maximum of 70 was recorded.

Rapid Automatized Naming

The Mobile Universal Lexicon Evaluation System (MULES) is a double-sided laminated 8.5 x 11-inch paper with 54 color photographs of fruits, objects, and animals in context (with their usual backgrounds) (Fig. 1a) (10-12). The Staggered Uneven Number (SUN) test is a single-sided 8.5 x 11- inch paper with 145 single- and double-digit numbers arranged in zig-zag or horizontal patterns with varied spacing (Fig. 1b) (14). Participants were asked to name aloud each picture or number as quickly and accurately as possible from left to right in the top row and every subsequent row. Two trials were performed and total time in seconds to complete the test and number of errors for each trial were recorded for the MULES and SUN. Inability to identify, misidentifying, or skipping a picture or number counted as an error.

Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

Participants underwent optic nerve head and macula scans of both eyes using Cirrus and Spectralis spectral-domain OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). The Spectralis OCT device was used because it is more sensitive than Cirrus OCT at detecting retinal atrophy, especially in an Alzheimer’s disease population (16). Cirrus OCT was also included because, unlike Spectralis, its software automatically isolates and generates the thickness of the ganglion cell/ inner plexiform layer. Using both devices, macular volume and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), macular, and ganglion cell/ inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thicknesses were measured. Specific OCT protocols and methods used including quality control of scans are previously published (17).

Vision-Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaires

Vision-specific QOL was measured by the 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) (18), which assesses self-reported visual impairment in everyday activities. The 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement to the NEI-VFQ-25 (19), which addresses specific neuro-ophthalmic visual symptoms, was also administered. Participants were asked to answer questions as if they were wearing their glasses or contact lenses for the activity specified. Questionnaires were scored using published algorithms (20); scale scores range from 0 (worst QOL) to 100 (best QOL).

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Prior to any analyses, OCT scans with insufficient quality or from eyes with reported or incidental retinal or optic nerve pathology were excluded from corresponding OCT analyses. Eyes with significant visual impairment (e.g. amblyopia) were excluded from monocular vision analyses.

Wilcoxon rank-sum or independent (two-sample) t-tests, depending on how well distributions of continuous variables met assumptions for normality, were used to identify visual tests that significantly differed between MCI participants and controls. Logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for MCI vs. control status based on vision test scores, accounting simultaneously for ocular pathology, age, gender, education, or best corrected visual acuity. To account for these factors, they were individually adjusted for in separate logistic regression models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the capacity of the visual tests to distinguish between participants with MCI and controls; high-sensitivity score cut-offs based on the ROC analyses were determined. In a secondary analysis, the presence or absence of MRI hippocampal atrophy, determined by a cognitive neurologist masked to MCI vs. control status, was examined for capacity to distinguish MCI vs. controls. It is important to note that this assessment of hippocampal atrophy differs from the imaging criteria used to support a diagnosis of MCI due to AD. Neurodegeneration as part of the diagnostic criteria was based on the global cortical signature of AD (temporoparietal atrophy on MRI or hypometabolism on FDG-PET), while for this analysis, the hippocampal formation was qualitatively assessed in isolation. To determine the relation of vision-specific quality of life with visual measures, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were calculated. Cohen’s d guidelines were used to estimate the magnitude of correlations with 0.1 considered a small effect, 0.3 a medium effect, and 0.5 a large effect (21).

RESULTS

Among 14 participants with MCI and 16 controls without cognitive impairment, there were no significant differences in demographic factors (Table 1). Both groups, on average, were aged 75 years, had 17 years of education, and had best corrected binocular visual acuities between 20/20 and 20/25. Qualitatively, the MCI group had more reported ocular history and fewer female participants compared to controls (Table 1). None reported significant comorbid neurologic disease.

Among all studied visual measures, binocular LCLA at 1.25% contrast and MULES performance were the only measures that were significantly worse in MCI participants compared to controls (Table 2). MCI participants identified only one-third of the number of letters seen by controls at 1.25% contrast; this corresponded to a difference of 10 letters in binocular LCLA. MCI participants, on average, had MULES test times that were 1.6x longer (worse) compared to controls (difference of 35 seconds; P= 0.006) and committed 3 times more errors (P= 0.009). SUN test times and numbers of errors did not significantly differ between groups. Learning effects (improvement of time scores) between first and second trials of the MULES and SUN were not significantly different between groups; however, MULES learning effects were slightly less in the MCI group (Table 2).

For OCT, we were able to image 16 control and 14 MCI participants with the Cirrus and 14 control and 11 MCI with the Spectralis. Scans from 7 control and 10 MCI eyes were excluded from macular analysis and scans from 4 control and 9 MCI eyes were excluded from optic nerve head analysis. These scans were excluded because of existing or incidental ocular pathology (epiretinal membrane, macular hole, glaucoma, amblyopia, scleral crescents) or insufficient quality. From eyes that had good quality images, pRNFL and GCIPL measurements were generally thinner among the MCI group compared to controls; these differences did not reach statistical significance (Table 2).

Lower (worse) binocular LCLA scores at 1.25% contrast, longer (worse) MULES test times, and greater numbers of MULES errors were significant predictors of MCI vs. control status, accounting simultaneously for ocular pathology (Table 3). These associations remained significant in models accounting for age, gender, education, and BCVA. Subjective hippocampal atrophy on brain MRI was not a significant predictor of MCI vs. control status accounting for age in this cohort (Table 3).

ROC curve analyses demonstrated that 1.25% LCLA, best MULES test time (between two trials), and best MULES error score had comparable AUCs of 0.78-79 (Fig. 2). LCLA scores at 1.25% that are less than 20-23 letters were associated with a sensitivity of &gt;0.90 for detecting MCI, with a cut-off of 20 letters yielding a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.38. Best MULES times of 49.3- 49.7 seconds were associated with a sensitivity &gt;0.90, with a 56.6-second cut-off yielding a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.63. Further analyses with best MULES time and 1.25% LCLA combined had the greatest AUC with a value of 0.87 (P=0.001). Best MULES error score and 1.25% LCLA combined had an AUC of 0.84 (P=0.002); a combination of all three measures yielded an AUC of 0.86 (P=0.001).

MCI participants had reduced NEI-VFQ-25 composite (overall) scores (these scores exclude the single item for general health) (Table 4). Differences in scores for the 10-Item Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement, which assesses primarily efferent aspects of vision, were not significant. Among all participants, NEI-VFQ-25 scores were lower (worse) among those with lower (worse) 1.25% LCLA scores (Table 5). Rank correlation of MULES errors with NEI-VFQ-25 scores were also significant with a large Cohen’s d effect size.

DISCUSSION

Results of this pilot study demonstrate that the Mobile Universal Lexicon Evaluation System (MULES) test of rapid picture naming and binocular low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) at 1.25% contrast distinguish patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from similar-aged controls without cognitive impairment. Since MCI is prodromal to AD, it is important that these visual measures are showing early promise as future markers to identify disease states and to potentially follow patients in clinical trials and observational research. Notably, both MULES and LCLA were stronger predictors of MCI disease status than was hippocampal atrophy on MRI; however, our cohort size may have limited our findings in this regard. Our research on markers of visual pathway structure and function in MCI and AD will continue, harnessing the well-characterized nature of the NIH-funded NYU Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center cohort.

Our preliminary finding of a lack of association of hippocampal atrophy with reduced visual function and retinal thinning is important since biomarkers of neuronal injury, including hippocampal volume loss, are included in official guidelines as methods to increase diagnostic certainty of AD etiology and provide information about disease stage (15). Our results provide early support for the addition of vision-based biomarkers to these guidelines, which may further increase diagnostic sensitivity when paired with existing biomarkers. Reduced 1.25% LCLA scores and greater numbers of MULES errors were also associated with decreased vision-specific quality of life, consistent with prior findings that impaired contrast sensitivity was highly correlated with perceived visual disability (22-24).

Performance on the SUN, a new rapid number naming test, did not differ between the MCI and control groups; this is in contrast to a study using the King-Devick test of rapid number naming, where AD dementia and MCI subjects had significantly worse time scores compared to controls (13). However, unlike our cohort, their MCI cohort was not specific to AD and included non-amnestic MCI subtypes, which can be prodromal stages of Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia (25). The sample size was also substantially larger in that study. Dementia may also impair cognitive and vision-related pathways differently in early disease, which may, in part, explain the discrepancy between studies. Larger investigations of the SUN are needed, particularly as this test has a smaller learning effect (thus potentially more reliable longitudinally) and likely involves some different brain pathways from those related to MULES performance.

RAN tasks for pictures vs. numbers likely involve recruitment of different brain pathways for vision and other dimensions of function, such as language and concentration (26). The perirhinal cortex (PRC), involved in feature integration, assists in picture recognition by discriminating the presented object from others with similar features (27, 28). The PRC contains the transenterorhinal cortex, the earliest site of tau deposition (29), and atrophy and tau deposition within this structure has been found in MCI and early AD (30, 31). Pathology in the PRC may occur earlier than in areas implicated in number naming such as the precuneus and bilateral supramarginal gyrus (32), leading to impaired picture naming but not number naming in early disease. Functional MRI and PET studies are needed to explore which brain regions are implicated in picture and number-based RAN tests and affected by AD pathology. In addition, MULES pictures are more difficult to identify than SUN numbers because the MULES requires identification of the presented picture from limitless pictures stored in memory, while for the SUN, there are limited numbers to choose from in stored memory (single- and some double-digit numbers). Identification of a MULES picture versus SUN number also requires additional pathways involved in object categorization, object- specific memory, and color vision; thus, subtle deficits in any of these areas may be apparent on performance on a timed picture naming test.

The capacity for retinal thinning to reliably detect MCI remains controversial, with some studies reporting pRNFL and GCIPL thinning (33-35), while others do not (36-38). Our study found that participants with MCI had, on average, lower values for pRNFL and GCIPL; these differences were not significant. Our findings may be a result of small sample size, or retinal thinning may be less apparent in early disease. Inflammatory changes in the form of retinal ganglion cell swelling and Mueller glial cell hypertrophy are proposed to mask any underlying retinal thinning and contribute to non-significant differences or even retinal thickening in early AD compared to controls (39). Interestingly, despite no significant differences in retinal thickness values, MCI participants demonstrated significant reductions at the lowest level of contrast (lightest gray letters on retro-illuminated background) for LCLA. This may suggest that subtle changes in visual function may occur earlier than retinal changes captured by optical coherence tomography. Alternatively, the OCT measures may have a smaller effect size than other continuous variables (such as LCLA, MULES time scores) in the dataset, and thus a small cohort would impact power even more for this measure.

Since this is a preliminary study, there are some important limitations to note. First, we had a relatively small sample size in each group, which decreased our study power to detect differences between groups. Second, most of our MCI participants did not have confirmed amyloid or tau biomarkers, which limits diagnostic certainty. Our MCI participants were also recruited from both a clinic and research cohort and, therefore, were more likely to have potential comorbidities than controls (controls were recruited from a research cohort that underwent strict exclusion for comorbidities). Furthermore, we did not exclude participants with common ophthalmic diseases in order to preserve a more generalizable cohort of patients with MCI and controls. We did account for comorbid ocular pathology in our analyses; however, severity and type of ocular pathology may vary between groups and affect visual test performance. Finally, mood, which was not accounted for in study analyses, may possibly affect performance on MULES testing. Depressive symptoms are frequently observed in AD dementia and in MCI (40-42), and can impair concentration, attention, memory, and processing speed (43); all of these are needed to accurately perform rapid automatized naming.

CONCLUSIONS

The MULES and LCLA testing at 1.25% contrast emerged in this preliminary study as visual measures that distinguish individuals with MCI due to AD versus those with normal cognition; the MRI analyses suggest that these visual measures may be at least complementary to other AD or MCI diagnostic biomarkers. Both MULES and LCLA tests are brief and easily administered and their scores are associated with vision-specific quality of life. Future studies should incorporate a larger cohort, evaluate how these measures compare to other established biomarkers, and investigate the associations of visual pathway structure and function with performance on cognitive testing and disease progression. Investigation in preclinical disease, such as subjective cognitive decline, may elucidate the capacity for vision-based measures to detect even earlier disease processes for patients with AD.
