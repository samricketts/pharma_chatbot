Episodic memory is affected early in the neuropathological process of Alzheimer’s dementia. This study was performed to identify longitudinal associations between baseline vascular/neuropsychiatric risk factors and episodic memory changes over 4.1 ± 2.4 years in 1,401 older adults with subjective cognitive decline (age 74.0 ± 8.2 years). Data were from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center-Uniform Data Set and linear mixed effects regression models were used. Reference was those without risk factors. Participants with hypercholesterolemia and with former cigarette smoking had higher episodic memory scores, but current smokers had fewer points than reference at their first and follow-up visits. Despite no difference at baseline, episodic memory scores decreased in those with depressive symptoms relative to reference over time. In older adults with subjective cognitive decline, interventions managing current smoking and depressive symptoms could preserve episodic memory, which may result in delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s dementia. Further research is required for the role of cholesterol and smoking.

Introduction

Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80% of all dementias. The number of individuals aged 65 years or older with AD is projected to expand from 5.5 to 13.8 million by 2050 in the United States, but currently there are no disease-modifying treatments.1 The clinical trajectory of AD consists of three phases: preclinical (cognitively normal), prodromal (mild cognitive impairment [MCI]), and AD. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is defined as a reduction in cognition recognized by cognitively normal individuals compared to their previous abilities. The state of SCD has been proposed to be the first clinical symptom of preclinical AD before the onset of MCI. The presence of SCD could harbinger a future decline in cognition.2–4 Thus, persons with SCD can serve as a potential target population for early intervention trials to deter AD.

The initial hallmark symptom of AD is gradually worsening memory. Especially, episodic memory is typically affected early in neuropathological changes associated with AD. A clinical diagnosis of AD requires evidence of memory loss with declarative episodic memory being affected the most.5,6 To facilitate the implementation of appropriate preventive measures, it is crucial to identify modifiable risk factors associated with episodic memory changes in persons with SCD. However, little research investigated this topic. Previous studies with individuals without dementia have suggested that modifiable vascular and/or neuropsychiatric risk factors could affect memory or the development of AD. Vascular risk factors encompassed diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, and cigarette smoking history. Neuropsychiatric risk factors included anxiety and depressive symptoms. An observational study showed that diabetes mellitus was associated with poor memory performance (β=−0.10) in older adults with the mean ages of 67.6 years.7 A meta-analysis of observational studies indicated that people with type II diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia presented 50% and 70% higher risk of AD than those without each condition, respectively.8,9 Furthermore, an association between hypertension and low episodic memory performance (r=−0.18) was present in a meta-analysis.10

A higher body mass index (BMI) in midlife appears to be a risk factor for AD and one-unit increase in BMI led to earlier onset of AD by seven months.11,12 Current cigarette smoking was associated with poor memory performance (β=−2.265) and a 70% higher risk of AD in people with the mean ages ranging from 62 to 65 years.13,14 Anxiety symptoms were associated with decreased verbal (β=−0.19) and episodic memory (β=−0.38) in older adults with the mean ages of 65 to 75 years.15,16 In samples of older adults (average age 70 years), depressive symptoms at baseline predicted memory loss and increased the risk of AD by 50%.17,18

While previous studies indicated that vascular and/or neuropsychiatric risk factors would affect episodic memory in people without dementia, the association between those factors and episodic memory changes remains relatively unexplored in persons with SCD. Hence, the purpose of this study was to identify factors predicting episodic memory changes over time in persons with SCD. The hypothesis was that vascular/neuropsychiatric risk factors at baseline (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, cigarette smoking history, anxiety, or depressive symptoms) would be related to a decline in episodic memory over time.

Material and methods

Participants and study design

The present study used a retrospective longitudinal design to perform a secondary data analysis of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center’s Uniform Data Set (NACC-UDS). The NACC-UDS consists of data collected at an approximately annual interval at previous or current National Institute on Aging (NIA)-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs: comprising Alzheimer’s Disease Core Centers and Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers) in the United States. Data from all ADCs are comparable to each other because centers follow the standardized method to assess variables. Clinical data obtained through the NACC-UDS are highly reliable because trained clinicians evaluated participants by the use of validated measures. Approval of the institutional review board (IRB) was not required for the current study because the de-identified dataset was not deemed human research. The details of the dataset were previously delineated by the NACC researchers.19 The data used in the present analysis were collected between September 2005 and March 2015.

For SCD, a trained clinician conducted the standardized semi-structured interview with participants at the initial visit (baseline) to determine whether they reported a memory deficit compared to the former capacity (yes or no). To be included, individuals with SCD had to be cognitively normal and aged 60 years or over at baseline and had to have at least one follow-up visit.20 A normal cognitive state was based on the judgement of an experienced clinician, which was supported by values of widely-used global cognitive measures: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of 27 or higher21 and the global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR®) Dementia Staging Instrument of 0.22 According to these criteria, 1525 participants were originally selected.20 However, the present analyses included a total of 1401 participants whose episodic memory was assessed with the same measures over time. The minimum sample size was estimated to be 1176 for a significance level of 0.05, a medium effect size of 0.3, and a power of 0.80 using the power analysis for linear mixed models in R version 3.6.1 software (r-project.org).

Measurements

Vascular and neuropsychiatric risk factors

Vascular and neuropsychiatric risk factors were measured at baseline as independent variables.20 Based on matching participant-report, informant-report, and medical records, participants were evaluated in person by a trained clinician to assess their medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension (yes or no). Overweight/obesity was assessed at baseline using BMI which was calculated by the standardized formula, weight (lb) times 703 divided by height (in)2. Participants were categorized into underweight (&lt;18.5), normal (18.5 to &lt;25), overweight (25 to &lt;30), and obese (30 or over). For cigarette smoking history, participants were placed into three mutually exclusive categories based on self-reports at baseline. The non-smokers were participants who never smoked during their lifetime, whereas, the former smokers quit smoking but had a smoking history. The current smokers reported they smoke at the evaluation time point. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) assessed anxiety and depressive symptoms at baseline. The NPI-Q gathers information on symptoms that have occurred over the last month from an informant who is knowledgeable about the participant. Previous studies have established its reliability and validity.23,24 Symptoms were either present (mild/moderate/severe) or not.

Episodic memory

Annual composite episodic memory scores were a dependent variable. The two 0–25 range subtests, Immediate and Delayed Recall Tests of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, were used to calculate the composite scores. Their reliability coefficients ranged from 0.71 to 0.75.25 Composite episodic memory scores were created by following two steps: 1) normalizing two measures (i.e., Immediate and Delayed Recall Tests) by dividing scores by their max score, (i.e., 25 points each), and 2) aggregating across normalized items. Thus, composite episodic memory scores ranged from 0 to 2 with higher points indicating better performance.26 A composite assessment can reveal more specific associations between independent variables and episodic memory by detecting subtle cognitive changes.27

Covariates

The analysis models were adjusted for covariates such as baseline demographics, medical history, and indicators for ADCs.20 Demographics were presented as continuous (age and education) and categorical variables (sex, race, ethnicity, and marital status). Clinical assessment of medical history (yes or no) covered thyroid disease, Parkinson’s disease, congestive heart failure, seizures, atrial fibrillation, traumatic brain injury, alcohol/substance abuse, stroke, and vitamin B12 deficiency. To control for possible variation between centers, an indicator for ADC (i.e., anonymous numbers given to centers that provided the data) as a categorical variable was adjusted for because the dataset contains information from 35 different centers.

Data analysis

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were presented using means and standard deviations (SD) or numbers and percentages (%) as appropriate. Linear mixed effects regression models were used to identify factors associated with episodic memory changes over time. The regression model was presented as composite episodic memory scores = β0 + β1 (group indicator) + β2 (time) + β12 (group indicator × time). A group indicator referred to each vascular and neuropsychiatric risk factor (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, BMI category, cigarette smoking history, anxiety, and depressive symptoms). A group indicator had its own reference (i.e., diabetes mellitus vs. non-diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia vs. non-hypercholesterolemia, hypertension vs. non-hypertension, underweight/overweight/obese vs. normal weight, former/current vs. non-smoker, anxiety vs. non-anxiety symptoms, and depressive vs. non-depressive symptoms). The coefficient on group indicator (β1) estimated baseline differences between participants in a group compared to reference. The coefficient on time (years, β2) estimated if episodic memory changes over time in reference. The coefficient on interaction (β12) estimated differences in the rate of episodic memory changes in a group compared to reference. Statistically insignificant β12 indicates the rate of changes in episodic memory is similar between a group and reference over time.

Stepwise analyses were performed. The first model was a univariate-adjusted analysis adjusting for all covariates. Independent variables were selected for further multivariate analyses if coefficients on main effect (β1) or interaction (β12) were statistically significant in the first model in the context of a statistically significant coefficient on time (β2). Therefore, the second model was multivariate-adjusted analysis adjusting for chosen predictors and for all covariates. All coefficients were presented as means and standard error (SE). Two-sided significance tests were used for analyses with the level of statistical significance set at p value&lt;0.05. Multiple imputation was used for missing values of episodic memory. Most cases (98%) and values (98%) of the battery were complete. The pattern of missing was missing completely at random by the Little’s test.28 The data analyses and imputation were performed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results

Participant characteristics

A total of 1401 participants with SCD were included in the study (mean age 74.0 ± 8.2 years, mean education 15.9 ± 2.8 years, 946 [67.5%] females, 76 [5.4%] Hispanics, 1180 [84.2%] Whites, 763 [54.5%] married). Follow-up time ranged from one to nine years (mean 4.1 ± 2.4 years). At baseline, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension were present in 152 (10.8%), 713 (50.9%), and 714 (51.0%) participants, respectively. Based on BMI, 541 (38.6%), 23 (1.6%), 531 (37.9%), and 306 (21.8%) were normal, underweight, overweight, and obese, respectively. Cigarette smoking history included no lifetime smoking (n = 713, 50.9%), former smoking (n = 640, 45.7%), and current smoking (n = 48, 3.4%). Anxiety and depressive symptoms were present in 147 (10.5%: mild 111, moderate 31, severe 5) and 221 (15.8%: mild 166, moderate 51, severe 4) participants, respectively (Table 1).

Factors predicting episodic memory changes

Table 2 reports estimated effects of vascular/neuropsychiatric risk factors (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, cigarette smoking history, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) on episodic memory.

The univariate adjusted model

Non-significant factors:

The univariate adjusted model (the first model) indicated that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, overweight/obesity, and anxiety symptoms did not show statistically significant coefficients on main effect (β1) or interaction with time (β12), which means that those risk factors did not have any effects on episodic memory at baseline and over time. Therefore, they were not chosen for further investigation in the multivariate adjusted model (the second model).

Significant factors:

In contrast, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking history, and depressive symptoms showed statistically significant coefficients on main effect (β1) or interaction with time (β12), so they were entered into the multivariate adjusted model (the second model). To be specific, participants with hypercholesterolemia had episodic memory scores at baseline that were an average of 0.027±0.012 points higher than those without hypercholesterolemia. Scores increased in participants without hypercholesterolemia by an average of 0.008±0.002 points every year. There was no interaction between hypercholesterolemia and time, indicating similar rates of score changes between groups (i.e., hypercholesterolemia vs. non-hypercholesterolemia) over time.

Former smokers had episodic memory scores that were an average of 0.048±0.013 points higher than lifetime non-smokers at baseline. Scores increased in non-smokers by an average of 0.010±0.002 points every year. But no interaction between former smoking and time meant parallel rates of score changes between groups (i.e., former smoking vs. non-smoking) over time. Meanwhile, current smokers had episodic memory scores that were an average of 0.087±0.035 points lower than non-smokers at baseline. But there was no interaction between current smoking and time, indicating similar rates of score changes between groups (i.e., current smoking vs. non-smoking) over time.

Episodic memory scores increased in participants without depressive symptoms by an average of 0.010±0.002 points every year. Although there was no score difference between participants with and without depressive symptoms at baseline (p = 0.359), a significant interaction indicated that scores decreased in participants with depressive symptoms by an average of 0.013±0.005 points every year.

The multivariate adjusted model

The multivariate adjusted model is the second (final) model to identify factors associated with episodic memory changes. The model was adjusted for selected predictors (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking history, and depressive symptoms) and for all covariates (Fig. 1). The final regression model revealed episodic memory scores = 1.558 + 0.024 (hypercholesterolemia) + 0.035 (former smoking) − 0.081 (current smoking) − 0.015 (depressive symptoms) + 0.010 (year) − 0.014 (depressive symptoms × year). Reference was defined as a condition without hypercholesterolemia, smoking history, and depressive symptoms.

Participants with hypercholesterolemia and participants who were former smokers had episodic memory scores that were an average of 0.024±0.008 and 0.035±0.008 points higher than reference at baseline, respectively. Current smokers had episodic memory scores that were an average of 0.081±0.024 points lower than reference at baseline. Episodic memory scores were similar between those with and without depressive symptoms at baseline (p = 0.386). Episodic memory scores increased in reference by an average of 0.010±0.002 points every year. No interactions indicated parallel rates of episodic memory score changes over time between participants with hypercholesterolemia and reference as well as between participants who were former and current smokers and reference. Although episodic memory scores were similar at baseline, a significant interaction meant that episodic memory scores decreased in participants with depressive symptoms by an average of 0.014±0.005 points every year.

Subgroup analyses

Because the relationships between independent variables and episodic memory changes may differ by sex, we conducted subgroup analyses (Table 3). We applied the same stepwise analysis method as the entire group analysis and the results from the final model, the multivariate adjusted model, was presented. Among statistically significant predictors in the entire group analysis (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, former smoking, current smoking, and depressive symptoms), current smoking and depressive symptoms in women (n = 946, 67.5%) but hypercholesterolemia and former smoking in men (n = 455, 32.5%) were statistically significant predictors.

For women, current smokers scored 0.076±0.030 points lower in episodic memory than non-smokers at baseline. Each group’s scores rose by 0.007±0.002 points every year with the score difference (0.076±0.030 points) maintained. Episodic memory scores were similar at baseline between participants with and without depressive symptoms (β1=−0.013, p = 0.554). The scores in the non-depressive group rose by 0.007±0.002 points every year. However, episodic memory scores decreased in participants with depressive symptoms by an average of 0.017±0.006 points every year. For men, participants with hypercholesterolemia and participants who were former smokers had episodic memory scores that were an average of 0.029±0.015 and 0.070±0.010 points higher than those without hypercholesterolemia and non-smokers at baseline, respectively. The differences at baseline (0.029±0.015 and 0.070±0.010 points) were maintained over time with the scores rising by 0.028±0.005 points in all groups.

Discussion

Modifiable risk factors for episodic memory changes in individuals with SCD have not been well studied. Our results showed that participants with hypercholesterolemia and participants who were former smokers represented a higher episodic memory performance than those without these conditions at baseline and the performance gap remained over time. Current smokers had lower episodic memory scores than non-smokers at baseline with score differences between the two unchanged over time. Although there were no episodic memory score differences between participants with and without depressive symptoms at baseline, scores decreased in participants with depressive symptoms relative to those without depressive symptoms every year.

The findings showed seemingly counterintuitive observations about cholesterol and cigarette smoking history. Cholesterol is essential to make neurotransmitters. It explains why statins and other types of cholesterol-lowering medications could sometimes present forgetfulness as side effects.29 There were previous studies about protective effects of high cholesterol levels. Serum cholesterol was lower in older adults who converted to MCI while it was higher in those who maintained normal cognition over six years in a population-based study.30 Another study indicated that hypercholesterolemia in older adults is associated with slower cognitive decline over time. Over 3.4 years, the rate of global cognition decline was 0.2 points per year for participants without hypercholesterolemia but 0.1 points per year for those with hypercholesterolemia (difference p = 0.028), defined by total cholesterol of more than 200 mg/dl, in community-dwelling older adults with the mean age of 73.31

On the other hand, measures of cholesterol may be important to see effects of cholesterol on cognition. High blood concentrations of total cholesterol (&gt;5.18 mmol/L) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&gt;3.37 mmol/L) in late life were associated with global cognitive decline among community-dwelling Chinese older adults without dementia (mean ages: 79 years) over five years. The adjusted annual cognitive decline rate for the MMSE between groups (high concentration vs. reference) was −0.28 points for total cholesterol (p = 0.005) and −0.42 points for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.006). However, significant relations were not observed between abnormal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&lt;1.55 mmol/L), triglyceride (&gt;1.70 mmol/L) concentrations and cognition.32 Furthermore, subgroup analyses of our study showed that the protective effect of hypercholesterolemia is present among male participants. A previous study indicated that low triglyceride is associated with a decreased risk of AD in women only,33 but sex-specific studies are rare that identified the relationship of cholesterol and episodic memory. To delve into a complex sex-specific etiology of episodic memory changes, further research is necessary to identify associations between cholesterol levels and episodic memory in older adults with SCD using several profiles of cholesterol given that the dataset of our study did not clarify cholesterol measures.

Cigarette smoking has been believed to have a negative effect on brain health. Previous longitudinal studies indicated that current smoking was associated with a poorer memory performance, including episodic memory (difference with no smoking: immediate recall −0.08, delayed recall −0.07) in older adults over a five-year observation period.13,34 In the current study, contrary to current smoking, former smoking was not negatively associated with episodic memory. The detrimental effect of cigarette smoking probably disappears once people stop smoking. This means as long as people stop smoking, its brain-damaging effect can be recovered. It is congruent with the finding that current smoking was bad for episodic memory. However, different results on cigarette smoking in men and women suggest that such interpretation needs caution. In the subgroup analysis, current smoking in women but former smoking in men was a statistically significant predictor of episodic memory changes. It is also unclear if the deleterious effect disappears by simply quitting cigarette smoking. Chronic nicotine exposure through a large amount of smoking during lifetime (e.g., 20 cigarettes or more a day) was associated with atrophy of cholinergic input areas of the basal forebrain, which exhausted the cholinergic system reserve capacity and facilitated neurodegeneration.35,36 Thus, the relation between cigarette smoking and episodic memory is complex and may require further research with the exact amount of smoking in older men and women with SCD.

The episodic memory performance declined over time in participants with depressive symptoms. It indicates that managing depressive symptoms may be crucial to deter AD in the preclinical phase, especially for individuals with SCD. Similar topics in other populations showed that depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with the three times higher incidence of memory impairment over three to six years in older adults with the mean age of 70.18,37 However, in the present study, anxiety symptoms did not predict changes in episodic memory. It is in line with the Geda et al. (2014)’s study showing that anxiety symptoms led to a three-fold increase in developing cognitive impairment in non-memory domains.38 Sex-specific results of our study indicated that depressive symptoms are associated with episodic memory changes in women only, but anxiety symptoms do not influence episodic memory in both men and women. Our findings are not consistent with those of Potvin et al. (2011) presenting that depression disorders in men and anxiety symptoms in women predicted memory impairment.39 The different results may be due to different tools used. To measure anxiety and depressive symptoms, we and Geda et al. (2014) used the NPI-Q,23 but Potvin et al. (2011) used the DSM-IV.40 As opposed to the DSM-IV, the NPI-Q is a subjective tool measured by an informant and may be difficult to determine if the symptoms are clinically significant or indicate a pathological condition. To compare results, more sex-specific research needs to be conducted among older adults with SCD using other reliable/valid neuropsychiatric measures.

Contrary to expectations, episodic memory improved over time in this study. Given that participants had attained relatively higher education levels (mean: 16 years), they might have got used to regular neuropsychological assessments (i.e., practice effects). In this study, some vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and overweight/obesity did not affect episodic memory. Higher education levels would have helped participants better practice healthy lifestyles to manage these conditions (e.g., medication adherence, physical activity, and nutrition) which were not taken into account in the present study due to data availability. In addition, the duration of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and overweight/obesity can be an important determinant of cognitive decline because neurologically damaging effects of these vascular risk factors may be cumulative over time.41 Because information on duration was lacking in the database, further studies are necessary to elucidate whether episodic memory would be influenced differently by the chronicity of these vascular risk factors in older adults with SCD.

This longitudinal observational study used the systematically well-characterized data with large sample size. However, some limitations need to be mentioned. First, besides the lacking generalizability due to demographic make-up (i.e., high proportions of educated, female, and White people), the NACC-UDS does not represent a population-based sample as the dataset comprises information from each center adopting different research protocols. Second, the goal of the present study was to see the association between specific vascular/neuropsychiatric risk factors (i.e., diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, overweight/obesity, cigarette smoking history, anxiety, or depressive symptoms) and episodic memory. There may be other risk factors omitted from this study. Last, it is not known whether episodic memory changes were clinically meaningful in this study. Another longitudinal research using the NACC data raised a similar issue that cognitive changes in the cohort without dementia may not be clinically significant probably due to demographic characteristics (e.g., higher education level) and shorter follow-up periods.26 Additional research using a different cohort with the current study needs to be conducted to compare the extent of episodic memory changes by vascular/neuropsychiatric risk factors.

Implications

Preserving episodic memory may provide some resilience to AD since episodic memory deficit is normally the first manifestation of the path to AD. Thus, based on the findings of the present study, current smoking and depressive symptoms may not be negligible to potentially curb AD. Smoking cessation and managing depressive symptoms may lead to better cognition although little is known about the effects of interventions on cognition in older adults. In a cohort study, smoking cessation was associated with a 14% decreased risk of dementia as compared to continual smoking.42 Another observational study indicated that the higher amount of any type of physical activity (e.g., housework, walking, or swimming) helped improve cognition which was mediated by reduced depressive symptoms.43

Cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms can be managed through appropriate interventions. A meta-analysis showed that relative cessation rates were 1.6 to 3.2 times higher than control groups in pharmacological (e.g., nicotine patches), non-pharmacological (e.g., counseling), and multi-component interventions (e.g., both nicotine patches and counseling), which indicated efforts of smoking cessation can be successful.44 In another meta-analysis, physical activity showed a moderate to large beneficial effect on depressive symptoms relative to control groups.45 Experimental studies are required to see if interventions to manage cigarette smoking and depressive symptoms can curb episodic memory impairment in older adults with SCD.

Conclusions

Current smoking status and depressive symptoms in older adults with SCD may offer potential therapeutic targets to stave off AD. Additional research is needed to see how cigarette smoking and cholesterol impact on episodic memory in older adults with SCD using the exact amount of smoking and different profiles of cholesterol.
