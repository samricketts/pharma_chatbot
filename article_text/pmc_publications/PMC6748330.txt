Background and Purpose:

The aging HIV+ population have increased vascular comorbidities, including stroke, and increased cognitive deficits compared to the general population. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) MRI is a technique to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), and is more sensitive than regional volume loss in the assessing neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive aging. Previous studies have found global cerebral perfusion abnormalities in the HIV+ participants. In this study, we evaluated the specific regional pattern of CBF abnormalities in older HIV+ participants using quantitative whole-brain ASL.

Methods:

CBF data from the HIV Over 60 cohort and the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were retrospectively evaluated to identify 19 HIV+ older adults, all with plasma viral suppression (including five with HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder, or HAND), 13 healthy, aged matched controls (HC), and 19 participants with early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). CBF values were averaged by region of interest (ROI) and compared between the three groups using generalized linear models.

Results:

Accounting for age, education, sex, and vascular risk factors, the HIV+ participants demonstrated alterations in regional cerebral perfusion including hypoperfusion of bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital brain regions compared to both clinically normal and participants with MCI. ASL MRI shows reasonable test characteristics in distinguishing HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) from HC and MCI participants.

Conclusion:

This study finds significant changes in specific CBF patterns associated with HIV status despite viral suppression; data which should animate further investigations as to the pathobiological basis of vascular and cognitive abnormalities in HAND.


Introduction

By 2013, more than 25% of the HIV-infected (HIV+) population in the US was over 55 years old, a number projected to double by 20451. In this same population, the prevalence of HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) in the US may be up to 50%, despite access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)2. Cerebrovascular risk factors are prevalent in the aging HIV+ population. These individuals face increased vascular comorbidities, including stroke, and as well as cognitive deficits above that of the general population3,4. While the pathobiological basis of vascular and cognitive abnormalities in HAND is unclear5, studies implicate injury to the neurovascular endothelium, as HIV itself can induce endothelial dysfunction and capillary loss6. Indeed, virally suppressed HIV+ participants have gene expression profiles suggesting neurovascular endothelial dysfunction7–9. In this context, neuroimaging studies of HIV+ participants consistently demonstrate increased white matter intensities10–12 as well as altered cerebrovascular reactivity and autoregulation13,14. Given that small vessel ischemic disease is associated with reduced cerebral perfusion over time19 and hypoperfusion acts as precursor to volume loss in other neurodegenerative diseases20,21, several investigators have found global cerebral perfusion abnormalities in the HIV+ population22–25. This study evaluates the specific regional pattern of CBF abnormalities in older HIV+ virally suppressed participants using quantitative whole-brain arterial spin labelling MRI (ASL).

Methods

Participants

This study was based on 19 available cross-sectional brain MRIs from older HIV+ individuals enrolled in a larger cohort study of cognition in HIV+ individuals over age 60 (UCSF HIV Over 60 Cohort) that explored the relationship between HIV and aging. Five HIV+ participants in the study (26.3%) had Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MND) according to the Frascati criteria27, a HAND subcategory. In order to compare ASL scans from participants with HIV+ and MCI28, MCI and healthy control (HC) participants were matched to the HIV participants by age, sex, and education (Table 1). The matched HC and MCI participant brain scans were obtained as a part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI-2), which included ASL MRI (inclusion/exclusion criteria at www.adni-info.org). Participants with MCI had Mini-Mental State Examination score greater than 23, objective memory loss as shown on scores on delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II [0.5–1.5 standard deviations (SD) below the normal mean], Clinical Dementia Rating scale 0.5, preserved activities of daily living, and absence of dementia. All HC participants had Mini-Mental State Examination scores greater than 24 and Clinical Dementia Rating scale scores of 0). A T-test was used to compare the distributions of age and education between HIV+ and HC and between HIV+ and MCI participants, after checking that populations were normally distributed (Shapiro wilk test) and had the same variance (F test).

Cerebrovascular risk factors diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia were identified through either self-report, medication list, and medical chart review, and/or clinical data captured during the research visit. A 12-h fasting serum was captured within 3 months of neuroimaging. Diabetes was defined as a fasting glucose level greater than 125 mg/dL or current clinical diagnosis from medical history. Hypertension was defined as having a systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic &gt;90 mmHg; and hypercholesterolemia as having a fasting LDL level &gt; 160 mg/dL, total cholesterol &gt;200 mg/dL and/or current clinical diagnosis from medical history. Smoking history was defined as total tobacco use of more than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime.

ASL MRI acquisition

ASL MRI was performed at 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance machine from a single vendor (Siemens Magnetom Skyra) using a pulsed ASL method (QUIPS II with thin-slice T1 periodic saturation) with echo-planar imaging29. Details of ASL MRI data acquisition and processing are available online at adni.loni.usc.edu. Imaging parameters of the ASL scan were performed using the ADNI-2 protocol: field of view 256mm, matrix 64 ×64, repetition time 3400ms, echo time 12ms, inversion time of arterial spins (T1) 700ms, total transit time of the spins (T2) 1900ms, tag thickness 100mm, tag to proximal slice gap 25.4mm, 24 axial slices, slice thickness 4mm, time lag between slices 2.5ms.

ASL MRI preprocessing

All ASL images were preprocessed using an extensively described pipeline20,21. The ADNI investigator (D.T.) provided methods for quantitation of ASL data. Briefly, perfusion weighted images were computed by taking the difference between the mean-tagged and the mean-untagged ASL image. The first untagged ASL image (providing a full relaxed MRI signal) was used as a reference image of the water density and used to calibrate the ASL signal for computing CBF and to estimate the transformation to co-register ASL MRI and structural MRI.

Geometric distortion correction and structural to ASL MRI co-registration

To accomplish registration between CBF and structural MR maps, linear transformation with nine degrees of freedom based on normalized mutual information were augmented by a non-linear registration approach based on total variance30.

ASL MRI partial volume effect correction

The analysis aimed to measure blood flow in primarily gray matter tissue. To correct for gray/white matter partial volume effects, the scaled perfusion weighted image intensities were adjusted according to a linear model of gray and white matter contribution to the ASL signal and based on probabilistic segmentation of gray and white matter densities in each MRI voxel. Adjustments were made assuming a constant ratio between gray and white matter perfusion and the scaled reference image was adjusted assuming constant ratios between gray matter and water, white matter and water, and CSF and water.

Computation of cerebral blood flow

The scaled distortion corrected co-registered and partial volume corrected perfusion weighted images were normalized to the reference image to express the ASL signal in physical units of arterial water density as CBF (ml/100g × min).

Structural magnetic resonance imaging acquisition

Structural MRI was also acquired within the ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO protocols, using a T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence with the following acquisition parameters: repetition time 2300ms, echo time 2.98ms, flip angle 9°, field of 256mm, resolution 1.1 × 1.1 × 1.2 mm3.

Regions of Interest

Freesurfer (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) was used to generate anatomical ROI statistics for CBF and volume. Eighty-two brain regions from the left and right hemispheres were used in the analysis. Areas excluded from the analysis were brainstem, corpus callosum, ventricles, CSF, cerebellum, choroid plexus, vessels, and optic-chiasm, in both the left and right hemispheres.

Statistical Analysis

As the purpose of this study was to investigate if there is a specific pattern in CBF impairment in HIV+ participants compared to HC participants and compared to MCI participants, the CBF by brain regions and possible confounder factors were used as predictors of participant diagnosis (HIV+ vs. HC and HIV+ vs. MCI), under the hypothesis that if CBF in specific brain regions can be used to predict the participant diagnosis, the CBF pattern differs between HIV+ and HC (resp. MCI). All statistical analyses were performed in R31. HC and MCI participants were frequency matched to HIV+ participants on age, sex, and education (2.5 standard deviations); however age and education were still used in the analysis to adjust for any residual confounding.

The analyses were divided into two steps: (i) to create a predictive model to differentiate HIV+ from HC (respectively MCI) participants based on CBF and (ii) to perform casual inference by identifying the key CBF brain regions which are different between the diagnostic groups. Because of these goals, the high-dimensionality of the data (82 brain regions vs. 34 participants), and the high degree of multicollinearity in the data, a generalized linear model via penalized maximum likelihood (GLMnet)32 was used to model the data. Given that our outcome variables were dichotomous (HIV+ vs. HC and HIV+ vs. MCI), the binomial family was used (logistic elastic net regression). This model uses a penalty value (L2 penalty term in the sum of squared error loss function) to shrink coefficients of correlated predictors towards each other. An additional parameter (alpha) combines the L1 penalty (number of zero coefficients) and L2 penalty terms. In the current modeling strategy, ten-fold cross validation was used to optimize these two hyper-parameters. Additionally, all predictors were centered and scaled in the analysis. Missing data were compared between groups and brain regions to ensure imputation was acceptable33.

For both analyses (HIV+ vs. HC and HIV+ vs. MCI), the data was resampled 500 times by bootstrapping to ensure stable parameter estimates from the GLMnet model. At each iteration of the bootstrap, the data was randomly split into a training and test set (60% and 40%, respectively) and a GLMnet model was fit using 10-fold cross validation of the training set. The counts for each predictor, predictor coefficients, and accuracies of the model to predict participant classification on the left-out test set were collected at each iteration. Frequency bar charts of the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity values were plotted.

Although elastic GLMnet regression does not generate a p-value34, the mean coefficient value for each brain region and corresponding 95% confidence intervals can be calculated from the bootstrap coefficient distribution. Thus, these were used to compute the odds ratios (ORs) associated to each brain region by exponentiating the mean coefficients identified in the GLMnet model. The interpretation of an OR&gt;1 (respectively &lt;1) is that an increase (respectively, a decrease) of CBF in the corresponding brain region resulted in an increase of likelihood of being classified as an HIV+ participant. The ORs were plotted as dot-whisker plots to inspect how each brain region contributed to the model’s ability to distinguish HIV+ participants from controls.

Effect of HAND status on CBF

As stated in Table 1, five participants with HAND (categorized as MND) were among the HIV+ participants. To study the effect of HAND diagnosis on the results of the GLMnet regression for all HIV+ participants’ CBF (sensitivity analysis), a GLMnet model was computed and bootstrapped 50 times with the whole cohort and again excluding the five HAND-MND participants. To study the differences between the two sets of models, the mean coefficients for each brain region and demographic predictor were computed for each modality (including or excluding HAND-MND HIV+ participants) and the differences in mean coefficients were compared to the standard deviation associated with the corresponding predictor.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Nineteen HIV+, 13 age and education frequency matched HC participants and 19 age and education frequency matched MCI participants were included in these analyses (Table 1). For all participants, age ranged from 59 to 74 years old, and education ranged from 12 to 21 years. All HIV+ participants had suppressed plasma HIV RNA levels. There were 98 % of male participants in the whole cohort (Table 1). The HIV+ group included five HAND-MND participants meeting criteria for MND, and 14 cognitively normal HIV+ participants. No participants met the criteria for HIV-Associated Dementia or Asymptomatic Neurocognitive Impairment. Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors were present within the HIV+ group in similar proportions as in the HC and MCI groups (see Table 1).

Region of Interest CBF Alterations

Odds ratios from the GLMnet analysis were evaluated for 82 brains regions. Figure 1 shows the whole-brain patterns of CBF changes in each diagnostic group (HIV+, HC, MCI). Cold colors reflect hypoperfusion used to accurately distinguish HIV+ participants from the second group (HC or MCI participants). Hot colors reflect relative hyperperfusion in HIV+ participants compared to the second group. HIV+ participants are distinguished by bilateral occipital, posterior cingulate, and bilateral temporal lobes hypoperfusion relative to HC. When compared to MCI participants, HIV+ participants are distinguished by a pattern of bilateral temporal, posterior cingulate, and occipital hypoperfusion and bilateral frontoinsular hyperperfusion. The complete dataset of regional odds ratios is displayed in Figure 2.

Performances of the Elastic-Net regression

The elastic-net regression performed prediction of HIV+ vs. HC with a median accuracy of 0.75, a median sensitivity of 0.87 and a median specificity of 0.57; and a prediction of HIV+vs. MCI with a median accuracy of 0.73, a median sensitivity of 0.75 and a median specificity of 0.71. The frequency distributions of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity over bootstrap are shown in Figure 3.

Effect of HAND status on CBF

Supplementary Figure displays the difference of mean coefficients in the GLMnet models for regional CBF when including or excluding HAND-MND from HIV+ participants (gray bars) compared to the standard deviation associated with the corresponding predictor (black lines) for the two models (HIV+ vs. HC and HIV+ vs. MCI). A difference in mean coefficients smaller than the associated standard deviation was observed for all brain regions and for both models suggesting that the presence of HAND-MND participants was not driving CBF abnormalities in specific regions or predictors for HIV+ compared to HC or MCI participants.

Discussion

We demonstrate a significant effect of HIV+ status on regional CBF compared to age, sex, and education matched controls. Based on prior work22–25, our primary hypothesis was that a pattern of regional cerebral hypoperfusion in HIV despite plasma viral suppression would discriminate HIV+ participants from HIV− participants and from MCI participants. Our data suggests a pattern of hypoperfusion in HIV that involves bilateral temporal, and occipital regions previously noted to be affected by longitudinal volumetric reductions17 in a larger sample of the same cohort (UCSF HIV Over 60 Cohort). Moreover, regional cortical thickness reductions in temporal and occipital regions were related to poor neuropsychological performance in other cohorts of treated suppressed HIV+ participants16. Importantly, given volume correction as part of our data, our findings cannot be explained by structural variations in these participants; the reduction in CBF reflects perfusion within volumes rather than the effects of volume loss. These data and distribution of abnormalities are in keeping with a prior ASL MRI analysis that was restricted to a limited set of brain slices22. These results suggest that an older cohort of HIV+ participants demonstrates a CBF profile which might suggest the diagnosis of HAND rather than MCI.

Few studies have evaluated quantitative CBF changes in viral suppressed HIV+ participants. Ances et al.22 evaluated mostly untreated HIV+ participants with ASL MRI without whole brain coverage due to technical limitations of the available ASL technology at the time. Nonetheless, they found reduced CBF in bilateral occipital volumes. More recently, Su et al.23 evaluated mean gray matter CBF using whole-brain ROIs, demonstrating reduced CBF in HIV+ participants on ART. Importantly, the current study examines includes assessment of the vascular comorbidities that often accompany HIV+ status35. In our study, HIV+ participants demonstrated similar rates of smoking, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia compared with matched healthy controls and MCI participants, although two HIV+ participants had a history of diabetes.

As the HIV+ population reaches geriatric ages, differentiating HAND from early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has become a pressing HIV concern28. HIV-infected elders have higher rates of meeting criteria for MCI, an intermediate state between typical cognitive aging and dementia in HIV-uninfected patient populations39. Comprehensive cognitive testing may discriminate the cognitive phenotypes of mild HAND from that of MCI due to AD with reasonable accuracy28. Here we evaluated whether CBF measurements may add specificity to the evaluation of cognitive complaints in elderly participants with HIV+. Our data suggest CBF differences more accurately distinguish HIV+ participants from HC as compared to HIV+ from MCI participants. Given temporal and parietal CBF changes within the AD spectrum21, these findings are not surprising and explain the reduced sensitivity. However, when present, the abnormal CBF pattern in HIV+ participants is quite specific for the diagnosis HIV+ as compared to MCI. These findings suggest that ASL CBF measurements demonstrate appropriate test characteristics for a confirmatory study after neuropsychological evaluation in elderly HIV+ participants. Future work to evaluate the discriminative power of combined cognitive and ASL CBF datasets is needed.

Sensitivity analyses were completed to examine whether CBF changes in HAND-MND patients were driving CBF differences when comparing all HIV+ participants to other groups. We evaluated whether the HAND-MND subgroup showed regional CBF differences greater than the standard deviation of all others by comparing the mean coefficients in the GLMnet analyses. Given that the differences between each region’s mean coefficients between HAND-MND vs. others were much smaller compared to the standard deviation, the presence of HAND-MND is unlikely to explain CBF abnormalities among all HIV+ participants.

The mechanisms for the observed CBF alterations within HIV+ participants remains an area of active investigation. While many mechanisms might explain the interactive effects of age and HIV on the CNS, data suggest immune activation may induce and promote cerebrovascular inflammation40.

Strengths of the current study include the comparison of our cohort of HIV+ participants with a comparable HIV-uninfected control group and MCI group, all of which using the same ASL sequence, scanner and scanning parameters and analysis pipeline. In the existing literature, CBF measurement techniques often vary considerably among different study cohorts. In addition, our analysis required no a priori hypothesis with regard to a specific region of abnormality. Another strength represents the relative similarity of cerebrovascular risk factors between our HIV+ participants and comparison groups, a frequent confounder of studies of CBF and vascular disease in HIV. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously alongside the study’s limitations. First, because of the modest sample size, particularly in terms of uninfected controls, our findings are preliminary and need to be verified in a larger independent study. Second, this study presents an almost entirely male population which is particularly challenging given data suggesting cerebrovascular risk in HIV may be higher in woman42. Finally, the age of HIV+ participants reflects frequent seroconversion prior to the generalization of combination ART, and thus finding may not be generalizable to younger post-ART populations.

Conclusion

When accounting for age, education, sex, and vascular risk factors, HIV+ participants demonstrate alterations in regional cerebral perfusion including hypoperfusion of bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital volumes compared to both clinically normal and MCI participants. Our data also add to previous reports that MRI-measured CBF has diagnostic ability in comparison to cognitive assessment in distinguishing HAND-MND from MCI.
