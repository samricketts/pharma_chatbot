pmcIntroduction

Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at higher risk of live discharge from hospice compared to those without ADRD.1 Live discharge is often followed by burdensome transitions to acute care settings,3 which can be distressing to patients and caregivers.4 Although previous studies have identified risk factors for hospice live discharge,5 little is known about patient outcomes after discharge. As hospices move towards value-based care, improving post-discharge outcomes has important policy and clinical implications. We examined patient and hospice characteristics associated with preventable hospitalizations (PHs) among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD who were discharged alive from hospice.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used Medicare claims data of a 20% random sample of 2014–2019 fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries. We assessed patient ADRD status based on principal and secondary diagnoses during a hospice stay and diagnoses in other care settings up to three years before hospice admission.6 We used hospice claims files to identify live discharges based on discharge status codes.7 We required patients to have continuous enrollment in Medicare Parts A and B after live discharge until death or the end of the follow-up period (December 31st, 2019).

We employed the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Prevention Quality Indicators algorithm8 to identify PHs after hospice live discharge. We calculated rates of patients with at least one PH and by conditions of PHs. We modeled associations between patient and hospice characteristics and time from live discharge to the first PH using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Patient characteristics included demographics (i.e., age, gender, race/ethnicity), number of chronic conditions, dual-enrollment in Medicaid, end-stage renal disease, and advance care planning. Hospice characteristics included early live discharge (within seven days of hospice admission), late live discharge (on or after 180 days of admission), location of hospice services (e.g., home or nursing home), services provided during hospice stay, hospice ownership, and status of live discharge (e.g., patient revocation or condition stabilization). Patients were censored if they died or reached the end of the follow-up period. The Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine approved this study.

Results

Among 100,286 ADRD patients who were discharged alive from hospice (65,990 women [65.8%]; mean [SD] age, 84.9 [9.4] years), 9,972 (9.9%) had at least one PH after live discharge. The most prevalent condition of PH was heart failure (3.4%), followed by urinary tract infection (3.2%), community acquired pneumonia (2.1%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma (1.5%). PHs for other conditions were relatively rare, including diabetes long-term complications (0.4%), uncontrolled diabetes (0.3%), lower-extremity amputation among patients with diabetes care (0.2%), diabetes short-term complications (0.2%), and hypertension (0.2%).

In multivariable Cox regression (Table 1), patient characteristics including minority race/ethnicity (e.g., Black patient, adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04–1.21), higher number of chronic conditions (e.g., 3–5, aHR, 2.21; 95% CI: 1.83 – 2.82), end-stage renal disease (aHR, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01 – 1.48), discharged due to patient revocation of hospice benefit (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI: 1.14 – 1.26), and discharged alive within a 7-day hospice stay (aHR, 1.17; 95% CI: 1.08 – 1.27) were associated with a higher risk of having at least one post-discharge PH. Older age (e.g., 75–84, aHR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.75 – 0.95) and receiving hospice care in a facility, such as assisted living (aHR, 0.66; 95% CI: 0.61 – 0.70) and nursing facility (aHR, 0.44; 95% CI: 0.41 – 0.47) were associated with a lower risk of having at least one post-discharge PH.

Discussion

Approximately 10% of ADRD patients had at least one PH after hospice live discharge. Racial/ethnic minority patients were at a higher risk of PH after live discharge, potentially due to their limited primary care access.9 Patients discharged alive within seven days had a higher risk for PH, which may indicate that the patient was not in hospice long enough to identify and address their needs. Finally, patients who received hospice care in facilities had a lower risk for PH. These patients might be more likely to receive care and support after a live discharge compared with those who received hospice care at home. Hospices should coordinate care transitions after live discharge with primary and specialty care providers to maintain care continuity and reduce unnecessary hospitalizations.

Although this study is limited by its focus on Medicare FFS population, it provides the first examination, to our knowledge, on PHs among ADRD patients after hospice live discharge. As recent policy changes started to hold hospice providers accountable for post-discharge outcomes,10 these findings will be important to identify patients at high risk for unnecessary hospitalizations after hospice live discharge and improve end-of-life care for ADRD patients.
