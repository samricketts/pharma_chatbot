The genetic admixture of Caribbean Hispanics provides an opportunity to discover novel genetic factors in Alzheimer disease (AD). We sought to identify genetic variants for AD through a family-based design using the Puerto Rican (PR) Alzheimer Disease Initiative (PRADI). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and parametric linkage analysis were performed for 100 individuals from 23 multiplex PRADI families. Variants were prioritized by minor allele frequency (&lt;0.01), functional potential [combined annotation dependent depletion score (CADD) &gt;10], and co-segregation with AD. Variants were further ranked using an independent PR case-control WGS dataset (PR10/66). A genome-wide significant linkage peak was found in 9p21 with a heterogeneity logarithm of the odds score (HLOD) &gt;5.1, which overlaps with an AD linkage region from two published independent studies. The region harbors C9orf72, but no expanded repeats were observed in the families. Seven variants prioritized by the PRADI families also displayed evidence for association in the PR10/66 (P&lt;0.05), including a missense variant in UNC13B. Our study demonstrated the importance of family-based design and WGS in genetic study of AD.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly and occurs among all ethnic and racial groups (Reitz et al., 2011). Genetic studies have shown that genetic factors can have different risk effect sizes at the same loci as well as distinct risk loci across populations (Farrer et al., 1997; Reitz and Mayeux, 2014). The APOE and ABCA7 genes are notable examples of this population-specific variability. Association studies have shown that the effect of the APOE ε4 risk allele in East-Asian and non-Hispanic white (NHW) populations is strong, while it is considerably lower in populations with African ancestry (Farrer et al., 1997). Reitz et al. found that the ABCA7 gene has a much stronger risk in African Americans (AA) than in NHW individuals (Reitz et al., 2013). In a follow-up study, Cukier and colleagues identified a 44-base pair (bp) deletion in ABCA7 specific to individuals with an African ancestral background (Cukier et al., 2016). These findings show that association between risk and protective factors for AD is different across populations and suggest that distinct genetic architecture among race and ethnic groups may underlie disease pathogenesis. Thus, studying diverse populations may yield new insights into the genetic mechanisms of AD that trigger disease pathology and may be used to identify targets for the effective treatments. However, most of AD genetic studies to date have focused on NHW populations (Sirugo et al., 2019).

Additionally, currently identified AD loci only account for a portion of the underlying genetic basis of disease. One of the explanations to account for the missing heritability is the rare variant hypothesis; that is, rare genetic variation substantially contributes to disease risk (Ridge et al., 2013). One way to identify rare risk variants is to use family-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) approaches (Peng et al., 2013). Multiplex families (families with several individuals affected with AD) have a higher genetic burden of disease than sporadic cases. Furthermore, using multiplex families allows for the identification of highly penetrant rare variants that are shared among several affected individuals in a family. Thus, sequencing multiplex families provide a powerful strategy to identify rare risk variants associated with AD.

To begin addressing these issues, we ascertained multiplex AD families in a Caribbean Hispanic Puerto Rican (CHI PR) population. The CHI PR population has a high prevalence rate of AD (12.5%)—higher than the general U.S. population (10.1%)—but CHI PR populations are underrepresented in AD genetic studies (Feliciano-Astacio et al., 2019). Moreover, the genetic make-up of CHI PR individuals is not homogenous; they are highly admixed, with average ancestry values of 69% European (EU), 17% African (AF), and 14% Native American (AI) (Feliciano-Astacio et al., 2019). The ancestral heterogeneity in the CHI PR population makes it unique for the discovery of novel AD loci, as well as to test the influence of findings from AD studies on European-descent and African-descent populations. The objective of our study is to identify highly penetrant, rare risk loci in a CHI PR population by performing linkage and segregation-based approaches in multiplex PR families.

2.2 Study samples

Study participants were recruited as part of the Puerto Rico Alzheimer Disease Initiative (PRADI). Families were ascertained through the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics at the University of Miami. Twenty-three PRADI families (100 total individuals, 61 affected individuals) were included in the initial linkage analysis (Table 1). To be included, families were required to have at least 2 members with AD, available genomic DNA, and APOE genotypes. Patients were evaluated to determine their AD clinical status based on the current National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association criteria (NIA-AA) (McKhann et al., 1984). A detailed description of our ascertainment and clinical evaluation methods of the individuals have been previously described (Feliciano-Astacio et al., 2019). Briefly, cases were defined as individuals who had a previous clinical diagnosis of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or show evidence of a memory disorder, and meet standard criteria for AD or MCI (McKhann et al., 1984; Albert et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011). To be classified as AD, individuals had to meet the current NIA-AA criteria (McKhann et al., 2011). They were further classified as definite (neuropathologic confirmation), probable, or possible AD. Diagnoses of MCI were assigned using the NIA-AA criteria (Albert et al., 2011). We excluded individuals whose memory and cognitive problems were secondary to other causes (e.g.: stroke, psychoses, etc.) and those with a known pathogenenic mutation in an established AD gene (e.g.: APP (Kang et al., 1987; Selkoe et al., 1987), PS1(Schellenberg et al., 1992; Sherrington et al., 1996; St George-Hyslop et al., 1992; Van Broeckhoven et al., 1992), or PS2 (Levy-Lahad et al., 1995; Rogaev et al., 1995)). To be included in the study, unaffected family members had to be a first- or second-degree relative of a case, have MMSE or 3MS scores that fall above clinical cutoffs, were designated as unaffected at the age at exam, and no history of memory problems. An adjudication panel consisting of a neurologist, neuropsychologist and clinical team members reviewed all the medical records, clinical and family histories, and clinical tests. The panel reviewed all data and assigned best-estimate diagnoses.

2.3 Array genotyping, whole genome sequencing, and annotation

Genome-wide genotyping data were obtained using two platforms: the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array and the Illumina Global Screening Array. Quality control (QC) analyses were performed using software PLINK v.2 (Chang et al., 2015). Variants with the call score less than 95%, or not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p&lt;1.e-6) were eliminated. Individuals with genotyping call rates less than 97% were removed. The concordance between reported sex and genotype-inferred sex was verified using X-chromosome data. The relatedness among all of the individuals were assessed using “identical by descent” (IBD) allele sharing.

WGS was generated at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) and the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Miami using a Illumina NovaSeq instrument (Illumina, San Francisco, California, USA). Raw FASTQ files were processed on a high-performance computing cluster maintained by the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of Miami. We performed Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best practices on the data. For the quality control of the FASTQ files, we used FASTQC software (McKenna et al., 2010; DePristo et al., 2011; Andrews, 2010). Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 using bwa-mem, duplicates marked using PICARD, and base qualities recalibrated. Multi-sample variant calling, and joint genotyping were performed using the GATK HaploteCaller across all samples from the study (Li, 2013; Poplin et al., 2018).

Variants were annotated for their genomic location, relationship to genes, putative function, combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) score, and allele frequency using an in-house pipeline based on the Variant Effect Predictor Ensembl framework and Bravo (Rentzsch et al., 2019; McLaren et al., 2016; BRAVO variant browser, 2018).

2.4 Assessment of genetic ancestry

The chromosomes of the admixed CHI PR population represent a mosaic of EU, AF, and AI genetic ancestral blocks, and they can be estimated at the global and local levels by using ancestral methods. We first assessed the “global ancestry”, which refers to the average ancestry across the entire genome. We calculated the principal components using the PC-AiR approach that is robust to known and cryptic relatedness (Conomos et al., 2019). To estimate the admixture proportion for each individual, we performed model-based clustering algorithm that implemented in the ADMIXTURE software (Alexander et al., 2009). Then, we estimated the genetic ancestry local to the particular locus, “local ancestry”. To infer the local ancestry, we combined our dataset with the EU, AF, and AI reference populations using Human Genome Diversity Project reference panel (Cavalli-Sforza, 2007). Next, to phase, we used the SHAPEIT tool ver. 2 with default settings and 1000 Genomes Phase 3 reference panel (Delaneau and Marchini, 2014; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015). Finally, to estimate the local ancestry at each locus across the genome, we used RFMix software. We ran RFMix with the PopPhased option and a minimum node size of 5 (Maples et al., 2013).

2.5 Linkage analyses

We performed genome-wide multipoint parametric and nonparametric linkage scans on the array data using MERLIN v 1.1.2 software (Abecasis et al., 2002). First, we pruned markers using the PLINK software v2 (Chang et al., 2015) with independent pairwise LD pruning option (r2 &lt; 0.02). Then, we extracted allele frequencies for all markers using PR dataset (PUR) in the 1000Genome data (Delaneau and Marchini, 2014). Next, we performed both parametric multipoint affected individuals-only and nonparametric linkage analyses. Parametric multipoint affected individuals-only analysis was performed assuming a dominant model with incomplete penetrance (non-carrier 0.01, and carriers 0.90) and rare disease allele frequency 0.0001. The significance linkage threshold of HLOD &gt; 2 (p-value &lt; 0.001) was defined for the consensus regions with the multiple families contributing to the linkage peak.

Significant linkage regions were further used to examine the identical by IBD regions shared across all AD individuals within each of the families contributing to the linkage peak (LOD &gt; 0.57, corresponding to a nominal p-value of 0.05). IBD regions were estimated using MERLIN software and illustration was performed using PROGENY software (Progeny Clinical, 2019).

2.6 Variant filtering and prioritization

To prioritize the variants located within the linkage region, we applied several filtering steps using two datasets: (1) WGS data of PRADI families contributing to the linkage peak and (2) WGS data of an independent population of PR ancestry (PR1066: cases=140; controls=1220) (Prina et al., 2017).

WGS data of PRADI families:

First, we filtered the variants down to those with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of less than 0.01 using TopMed allele frequency information (BRAVO variant browser, 2018). Then, we used a CADD score of greater than 10 to select the top 10% of variants with function potential in the human genome. Lastly, we prioritized variants based on segregation pattern among the affected individuals within the families. Given that AD is a complex disease, we did not expect the risk variant(s) segregate with the affecteds completely. On the other hand, it was expected that the risk variant(s) to segregate with all the affecteds in family 87633, the family that contributes the most to the linkage signal. As such, the variants were further prioritized if they 1) segregated on average with more than 66% of affected in all families where they were observed; and 2) segregated 100% with affected individuals within family 87633.

Independent case-control WGS dataset:

We used an independent PR case-control WGS datasets to aid in further prioritization of the promising markers from the PRADI families: PR 1066. A detailed explanation of the dataset can be found elsewhere (Prina et al., 2017). Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the association between markers and AD in the case-control dataset. Promising markers from the PRADI families were further prioritized if they met one of the following two conditions: 1) the markers showed nominal significance (P&lt;0.05) in the case-control dataset and/or 2) the markers were only observed in cases but not in controls (therefore, no association test statistics can be generated). Finally, we prioritized genes that had variants segregating in multiple families.

2.7 C9orf72 repeat expansion

We performed fragment analysis to examine the previously reported hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 linked to disease as we have previously detailed (Nuytemans et al., 2013; DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al., 2011).

3. Results

To understand the genetic basis of AD in the CHI PR population, we performed WGS in multiplex PR families with AD. The data were analyzed with a two-step approach: linkage analysis to localize the chromosome region(s) most likely to harbor AD genes and then a segregation-based approach to identify rare variants with functional potential that are likely to be responsible for the linkage. Prioritized variants from the families were further evaluated in an independent case-control dataset from PR.

3.1 Linkage results and genetic ancestry

The parametric multipoint linkage scan identified a genome-wide significant linkage signal with the maximum HLOD = 5.1 on chromosome 9p21 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 1 of the supplementary material). In total, nine families supported evidence for linkage to the region with family-specific LOD scores higher than or equal to 0.59 (corresponding to a family-specific nominal P value of 0.05, Fig. 2 of the supplementary material, Table 1 of the supplementary material). Among the nine families contributing to the linkage peak, family 87663 with 6 affected individuals showed the highest family specific LOD score of 1.8 (Fig. 2). Across all the nine families, the linkage region with HLOD score higher than 2 (p-value &lt; 0.001) spans 14 Mega-bases (Mb) (positions 24 Mb to 38 Mb) on chromosome 9 (Fig. 1).

The admixture proportions in the families contributing to the linkage peak are illustrated in Fig. 3 of the supplementary material. The local ancestry in most of the families at the linkage region (chr9:24Mb-38Mb) was EU (5 families including family 87663), a combination of AF and EU genetic ancestry in two families, and AF in the two remaining families.

3.2 C9orf72 repeat expansion results

We evaluated whether any of the families carried the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene (Kohli et al., 2013). C9orf72 lies within the 9p21 linkage region and is the most important genetic cause of familial frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al., 2011). Results showed that no family had extended repeat expansions (&gt;30 repeats).

3.3 Prioritization results

Within the linkage region, 826 rare variants (minor allele frequency &lt; 0.01) with functional potential (CADD score &gt;10, i.e. among the top 1% most deleterious variations) were observed in the 9 PRADI families contributing to the linkage peak. These variants were further prioritized based on the segregation pattern, which resulted in 53 prioritized variants. Among them, 26 (49%) were genic and 27 (51%) were intergenic (Table 2 of the supplementary material). Within the 26 genic variants, seven variants are exonic, including two missense mutations within the CCL19 (rs200320850) and UNC13B (rs35199210) genes.

To further prioritize the 53 variants, we used the association test statistics from an independent case-control cohort of PR ancestry (PR1066) with WGS data. Among the 53 markers prioritized by the PRADI families, 42 were observed in PR1066 dataset and seven of them showed evidence for association with nominal significance (P&lt;0.05, Table 2). Remarkably, one marker (rs72711518) showed complete segregation in two families (87663 and 87590), and 67% of segregation in a third family (87511). rs72711518 is an intergenic marker located between the IZUMO3 and TUSC1 genes, with a CADD score of 11.61. The marker rs184029924 has the highest CADD score (CADD=20.6) and the highest OR (OR=5.3). It is located between LOC100506422 and CAAP1 gene. It segregated 100% in family 87663, and 67% in family 87511. Two other markers, rs143918559 and rs35199210, shared the same segregation pattern: 100% in family 87663, and 33% in family 87511. While rs143918559 is an intergenic variant residing between FAM205A and FAM205BP genes, rs35199210 is a missense variant in the UNC13B gene with a CADD score of 20.3. Three additional markers were observed only in family 87663, with CADD of 10.8~13 (Table 2).

4. Discussion

We report a genome-wide significant multipoint linkage region (HLOD &gt; 5.1) identified by analyzing 23 CHI PR multiplex families. The region of interest overlaps with the previously reported AD linkage peaks in the independent data sets of NHW (Pericak-Vance et al., 2000) and Israeli-Arab families (Farrer et al., 2003) (Fig. 1). Our ancestral analysis showed that the haplotypes segregating in the CHI PR families at the 9p21 region have both EU and AF genetic ancestral backgrounds, although most of them have EU genetic ancestry. The 9p21 region was also previously linked to other neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011; Renton et al., 2011).

We identified several rare risk variants that have a potential to increase AD risk. These variants were detected by combining linkage analysis, family WGS data, and an external sequencing dataset. The rare variants identified by our approach are extremely difficult to detect using traditional genetic association methods. Indeed, out of the 53 prioritized markers from the PRADI family dataset, 11 were not even observed in the PR1066 dataset consisted of 1360 inidviuals. Among the 42 variants observed in the PR1066 dataset, several variants displayed nominal significance in the same direction as in the family dataset, supporting their role as AD susceptibility variants.

The unc-13 homolog B (UNC13B) gene represents a promising candidate gene in the region. First, we identified a missense variant rs3519921in UNC13B that was segregating within two families (87663 and 87511), and was overrepresented in the AD cases in the PR1066 dataset (OR=2.7, P=0.02). In the family dataset, there are two additional missense variants in UNC13B, rs41276043 and rs139395290. The marker rs41276043, with a CADD of 25, segregated 100% within family 87580. It was not significant in the PR1066 (P=0.2) but was the in the same direction with an OR of 1.7. The marker rs139395290 has a CADD of 25.9 and was observed in one out of three affected individuals but also two unaffecteds in family 87604. UNC13B is an interesting candidate, as it encodes for a protein involved in calcium regulated vesicle priming and release at excitatory/glutamatergic synapses (Varoqueaux et al., 2008). Variants in the UNC13B gene have also been reported in individuals with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, while another member of the gene family, UNC13A, has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Nakamura et al., 2018; Egawa et al., 2016; Diekstra et al., 2014; Gaastra et al., 2016). Another gene of interest, C-C motif chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19), was also identified to have a segregating missense variant, (rs200320850). CCL19 is expressed in response to inflammation and acts to regulate lymphocyte and dendritic cell trafficking (Rangel-Mororno et al., 2007; Yanagawa et al., 2002). Intriguingly, CCL19 chemotaxis by peripheral natural killer cells is decreased in mild AD and MCI patients (Le Page et al., 2015).

This study has potential limitations. Current structural variant (SV) calling algorithism using WGS is not very robust. We did not observed any SV based on WGS. Therefore, it is possible that a structural variant in the region is responsible for linkage but is not detected by WGS. Although we examined the known repeat within the C9orf72 gene, other potential structural variants need to be examined. A different structural variant or regulatory mutation of C9orf 72 may contribute to the AD linkage signal. Second, we used an in-silico tool to predict the functional potential of the variants. Even though this approach is useful to prioritize the putative variants, in vitro functional studies that characterize these variants needed to be undertaken.

In summary, analysis of CHI PR families confirmed previously reported linkage signals to 9p21 in NHW and Israeli-Arab families. Our results do not support C9orf72 as the gene contributing to AD risk in our families. Further directions include a comprehensive structural variants analysis and in vitro characterization of the prioritized variants. The identification of segregating and putative damaging alterations in multiplex families indicate the critical role of rare variation in AD etiology.

Highlights

A genome-wide significant linkage peak (HLOD=5.1) on 9p21 was found in PR Families for AD.

A rare missense variant in UNC13B segregates within PR families and is associated with AD risk in an independent case-control PR WGS dataset.

Our study demonstrated the importance of family-based design and WGS in genetic study of AD.
