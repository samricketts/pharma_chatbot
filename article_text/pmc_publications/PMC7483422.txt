Although hippocampal volume has served as a long-standing predictor of cognitive decline, diffusion MRI studies of white matter have shown similar relationships. Still, it remains unclear if gray and white matter interact to predict cognitive impairment and longitudinal decline. Here, we investigate whether FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) within medial temporal lobe white matter tracts provides meaningful contribution to cognition and cognitive decline beyond hippocampal volume. Using data from the Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project (n=319), we found that FW was associated with baseline memory and executive function beyond that of hippocampal volume and other comorbidities for memory loss and executive function. Longitudinal analyses demonstrated significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT within the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.043) and cingulum bundle (p=0.025) with decline in memory. For decline in executive function, we found significant interactions on hippocampal volume and FAT within fornix (p=0.025). Results suggest that free-water metrics of white matter have a unique role in cognitive decline and should be include in theoretical models of aging, cerebrovascular disease, and AD.


Introduction

Late-life cognitive impairment arises from a variety of mechanistic pathways of injury including cerebrovascular damage (van der Flier et al., 2018; Vemuri and Knopman, 2016), AD neuropathology (Jack et al., 2018; McKhann et al., 2011), and other age-related neuropathologies (Schneider et al., 2007), resulting in damage to both the grey and white matter. Cerebrovascular disease and AD are two of the most common neuropathologies in aging and frequently co-occur, with nearly 80% of autopsy confirmed AD cases showing substantial cerebrovascular disease both of which contribute to the clinical manifestation of disease (Arvanitakis et al., 2016). Interestingly, the hippocampus is particularly vulnerable to many of the age-related neuropathological changes, making hippocampal structure and function a key indicator of age-related disease. For example, the hippocampus is susceptible to the earliest AD neuropathological changes (Frankó et al., 2013), subtle alterations in cerebral hemodynamics over the course of aging (Okonkwo et al., 2014), blood-brain barrier breakdown (Montagne et al., 2015), and hippocampal sclerosis (Barker et al., 2002). Thus, it is not surprising that hippocampal volume is a strong predictor of concurrent (Besson et al., 2015; Seab et al., 1988) and future cognitive (Goukasian et al., 2019; Jack et al., 2000) impairment.

While hippocampal volume is a well-established biomarker of neurodegeneration, including being a recommended measure in the recent biomarker definitions of AD (Jack et al., 2018), there is less focus on the white matter tracts projecting out of the hippocampus. Like the hippocampus, the cerebral white matter sits at the intersection of many age-related disease processes including well-established associations between cerebrovascular disease and white matter integrity (Croall et al., 2017; Fuhrmann et al., 2019; Vemuri et al., 2018), and emerging evidence of direct associations of AD neuropathology with white matter integrity (Hoy et al., 2017). While some changes in the white matter tracts projecting from the hippocampus may be the result of neurodegeneration within the hippocampus, it is also possible that hippocampal atrophy and white matter damage in tracts projecting from the hippocampus have a synergistic relationship, through which individuals with both reduced gray matter volume and reduce white matter microstructure are predisposed to lower cognitive function and more rapid cognitive decline.

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a particularly useful neuroimaging technique as it allows for the in-vivo quantification of white matter tract microstructural deficits. The most well-established microstructural measure in dMRI is fractional anisotropy (FA), and FA reductions have been associated with demyelination and axonal degradation (Beaulieu, 2002). White matter FA has been found to contribute to cognitive decline in normal aging (Cremers et al., 2016; Kennedy and Raz, 2009), AD (Bozzali et al., 2012; Mielke et al., 2012; Yasmin et al., 2008), vascular risk factors (Vemuri et al., 2018), and overt cerebrovascular disease (Vernooij et al., 2009). While these finding have suggested a significant role of white matter microstructure in cognitive function, FA is susceptible to partial volume effects (i.e., both fluid and tissue are present within a voxel) and could therefore limit our findings in AD. Fortunately, post-processing techniques, such as free-water (FW) elimination, have allowed for the separation of the fluid (FW) and tissue (FW-corrected FA [FAT]) components, thus increasing the biological specificity of dMRI studies.

Recently, the FW elimination post-processing technique has been paired with tractography algorithms to quantify white matter tract alterations in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsonism (Archer, Derek B. et al., 2019) and AD (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019; Hoy et al., 2017). A recent study conducted tractography to create individual-specific estimations of several white matter tracts, including the fornix, superior cingulum bundle, and transcallosal tracts. Higher FW within the superior cingulum was associated with higher CSF measures of neurofibrillary tangle load (CSF p-tau), thin unmyelinated axons (CSF t-tau), and soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPPβ) (Hoy et al., 2017). Interestingly, however, tract microstructure was not associated with cognitive decline. One potential reason for this finding is that tractography results were individual-specific, limiting generalizability. Recent work has resolved this generalizability limitation by creating high-resolution, spatially precise tractography templates using Human Connectome Project (HCP) data (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019). Specifically, the transcallosal tract template (TCATT) includes 32 transcallosal tracts, including projections to the temporal lobe (e.g., tapetum). Widespread elevated FW was found within the TCATT in AD, and the tapetum was robustly associated with global cognition as measures by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Still, it is unclear how white matter microstructure within the tapetum, as well as in other medial temporal lobe white matter tracts, interacts with gray matter on cognitive impairment and longitudinal cognitive decline.

The goal of the present study is to expand upon prior tractography research in AD to provide a detailed exploration of the cognitive consequences of medial temporal lobe changes in older adults free of dementia. Specifically, we leveraged high-resolution HCP data to create white matter tractography templates of the cingulum bundle, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. These templates, in addition to freely available white matter tract templates of the fornix (Brown et al., 2017) and tapetum (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019), will be used to determine unique contributions of white matter FW and FAT in cognitive function in a longitudinal cohort of individuals with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, we will examine the synergistic relationship of gray matter atrophy (i.e., hippocampal volume) and medial temporal lobe white matter FW and FAT in cognitive decline. Our hypothesis is that medial temporal lobe tract microstructure will explain unique variance in baseline cognitive performance and that individuals with both reduced medial temporal lobe tract microstructure and smaller hippocampal volume will have a more rapid rate of cognitive decline over the follow-up period.

Methods

Study Cohort

The Vanderbilt Memory &amp; Aging Project was launched in 2012 and is a longitudinal observational study. Cohort inclusion criteria required participants to be 60 years of age or older, speak English, have adequate auditory and visual acuity for testing, and have a reliable study partner. Full characterization of cohort has been described elsewhere (Jefferson et al., 2016). At study entry, participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological examination and were placed into three categories – cognitively normal, early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI), and MCI (Kresge et al., 2018). Neuropsychological assessment was collected longitudinally up to five years and neuropsychological composites of executive function and memory were calculated (Kresge et al., 2018). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) haplotype status (ε2, ε3, ε4) was determined using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs7412 and rs429358, which were genotyped using TaqMan on frozen whole blood. T1-weighted MRI and dMRI was also collected. The protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained prior to data collection.

Neuropsychological Composites

The neuropsychological protocol was performed by experienced technicians who assessed several cognitive domains, including episodic memory and executive function. There has been a longstanding effort to minimize multiple comparisons in neuropsychological testing by creating psychometrically sound composites of executive function and memory (Crane et al., 2012). As previously described (Kresge et al., 2018), we created psychometrically sound composite measures, in which we based our item assignments of memory and executive function on expert opinion from 2 clinical neuropsychologists (K.A.G., A.L.J.). The executive functioning composite included the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Tower Test, DKEFS Letter-Number Switching, DKEFS Color-Word Inhibition, and Letter Fluency (FAS). For the memory composite, the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II) Total Learning, Interference Condition, Long Delay Free Recall, and Recognition components were used in addition to the identical components of the Biber Figure Learning Test (Gifford et al., 2018; Glosser et al., 2002).

Acquisition and Quantification of Hippocampal Volume

T1-weighted MRI images (TR/TE: 8.9/4.6 ms, resolution: 1mm isotropic) were collected from each participant on a 3T Philips Achieva system (Best, The Netherlands) using an 8-channel SENSE reception coil. Multi-Atlas segmentation was conducted to obtain hippocampal segmentations and calculate volumes (Asman and Landman, 2012). Hippocampal volume was quantified by summing the left and right hippocampal mask volumes. Multi-Atlas segmentation also estimated the total intracranial volume (TIV) and total white mater volume. The hippocampal volume measures was adjusted by TIV based on an established approach (Mormino et al., 2014), which allowed us to eliminate the need for a TIV covariate in our statistical analyses. Further, participants were classified into two groups based on this adjusted hippocampal volume measure – neurodegenerative negative (&gt;6723 mm3) and neurodegenerative positive (&lt;6723 mm3)

dMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing

dMRI images (resolution: 2mm isotropic, b-values: 0, 1,000 s/mm2) were collected from each participant using the same scanner described above. Images were collected along 32 diffusion gradient vectors and five non-diffusion (B0) weighted images. FSL 5.0.9 (fsl.fmrib.ox.ax.uk) was used for all dMRI preprocessing (Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016; Jenkinson et al., 2012). Quality assessment of all dMRI scans was performed manually. The data were first corrected for head motion and eddy currents using eddy_correct and the brain was then extracted from the skull (BET). This corrected image was used as input in two different procedures: (1) DTIFIT to calculate fractional anisotropy maps (FA), and (2) custom written MATLAB (R2019a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) code to calculate FW and FAT maps, as described in detail previously (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019; Pasternak et al., 2009). To obtain a standardized space representation of the FW and FAT maps, the FAT map was registered to an inhouse FAT template (1mm isotropic) by a nonlinear warp using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package (Avants et al., 2008). This nonlinear warp was applied to the FW map.

White Matter Tractography Templates

HCP dMRI data (resolution: 1.25mm isotropic, b-values: 0, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 s/mm2, 90 directions per shell) (Van Essen et al., 2013) was used to create white matter tract templates using an established approach (Archer et al., 2018). This approach performs probabilistic tractography in the white matter tract of interest in 100 HCP individuals. The results are transformed into the MNI space, averaged into a mean tract template, and thresholded using a novel slice-level thresholding approach. This approach allows higher threshold levels compared to conventional thresholding methods, thus reducing the likelihood of false positives in the resulting tract templates. This approach has been used to create white matter tract templates of the sensorimotor tracts (Archer et al., 2018), transcallosal tracts (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019), and subcortical tracts (Archer, Derek B. et al., 2019). White matter tract templates included tracts projecting from hippocampus (tapetum, fornix, cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus). For the tapetum, we used a template tract from the Transcallosal Tract Template (TCATT)(Archer, D. B. et al., 2019). For the fornix, we used a well-established fornix template (Brown et al., 2017). For the cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, we conducted probabilistic tractography to create white matter tract templates as current tractography templates for these tracts were either incomplete or nonexistent. Consistent with prior work (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019; Archer et al., 2018), we conducted probabilistic tractography using the probtrackx2 program in FSL using default settings (samples: 5,000, curvature threshold: 0.2, FA threshold: 0.2) on 100 individuals from the HCP (Van Essen et al., 2013). For the cingulum bundle, we used a hippocampal mask as a seed and an anterior cingulate cortex mask as a waypoint. For the uncinate fasciculus, we used a hippocampal mask as a seed and a prefrontal cortex mask as a waypoint. For the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, we used a hippocampal mask as a seed and a posterior parietal cortex mask as a waypoint. FAT and FW were then calculated within all tracts for all participants.

Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2 (http://www.r-project.org/). Covariates included age, sex, education, cognitive status, race/ethnicity, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP) scores (D'Agostino et al., 1994; Wolf et al., 1991), total white matter volume, and APOE-ε4 carrier status. APOE-ε4 carrier status was defined as positive (ε2/ε4, ε3/ ε4, ε4/ ε4) or negative (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3). A variance inflation factor was calculated for all covariates in all models to ensure that multicollinearity was not a limitation. Significance was set a priori as α=0.05 and correction for multiple corrections were made using the false discovery rate (FDR) method.

For all analyses, only one tract per model was considered. Baseline effects of all tracts (tapetum, fornix, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus) for both measures (FW and FAT) were estimated using a general linear model for each of the 3 outcomes (hippocampal volume, memory composite, executive function composite). Further, cognitive status x white matter tract interaction terms (e.g., cognitive status x cingulum FAT) were evaluated for each tract and measure on the 3 outcomes. We then conducted an analysis of hippocampal volume x white matter tract interaction terms on memory and executive function composites. This analysis was followed with post-hoc competitive model analysis which assessed the unique variance white matter measures contributed to cognitive function beyond comorbidities and hippocampal volume.

Finally, we evaluated the interaction between baseline hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT on longitudinal memory and executive function composites using mixed-effects regression analyses. Time was modeled as years from baseline for each participant, and both time and the intercept were inputted as both fixed and random effects in the model. The three-way hippocampal volume x white matter tract x time term assessed baseline interaction effects on longitudinal change in cognition. All lower-order interactions were included in the model.

Results

Participant Characteristics

Demographic and clinical variables for each cognitive status group (cognitively normal, eMCI, MCI) are summarized in Table 1. Patients were mostly well-educated, elderly, non-Hispanic white individuals. There were no significant differences in age, sex distribution, or race distribution between groups. The cognitively normal group had more education than the MCI group. The MCI group had more APOE-ε4 positive individuals than the cognitively normal group. As expected, there were significant differences between the cognitively normal, eMCI, and MCI groups in hippocampal volume, total FSRP score, and neuropsychological composites.

Baseline Tract Microstructure Association with Baseline Hippocampal Volume and Memory/Executive Composites

Baseline results are presented in Table 2 and graphically summarized in Figure 1. White matter associations with hippocampal volume included FAT in the tapetum (p=0.033) and fornix (p&lt;0.001) and FW in all tracts (all p≤0.003). White matter associations with memory and executive function included FW in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum (all p≤0.045), but no FAT associations with baseline cognitive performance were observed. As shown in Figure 1A, higher FW in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus was associated with lower composite memory performance in all cognitive status groups. Similarly, Figure 1B shows that higher FW in the tapetum is associated with lower composite executive performance in all cognitive status groups. We did not observe any diagnosis x white matter tract interactions (all p≥0.191). Further, variance inflation factor values were low (range: 1.21-2.04) in all models, demonstrating that multicollinearity was not present in our models.

We then conducted a competitive model analysis to determine the unique variance explained by hippocampal volume and white matter tract microstructure in addition to all covariates (age, sex, education, cognitive status, APOE-ε4 status, race, FSRP scores, total white matter volume) (Table 3). We found that covariates explained approximately 50% of variance in baseline memory performance (Radj2=50.54%). When adding hippocampal volume to this model, we found a small increase (Δ Radj2=0.91%) in the overall model. We then iteratively added tract FW and FAT measures to this model to determine if tract microstructure explained any unique variance beyond covariates and hippocampal volume. We found that tract FAT did not significantly contribute to the models; however, for FW, all tracts (aside from the fornix) were significant contributors to the model and provided increases in the Radj2 (range: 0.70%-2.24%). For executive function performance, there was a strong relationship with covariates along (Radj2=47.13%), and the addition of hippocampal volume to this model provided a small, insignificant increase (Δ Radj2=0.03%) in the overall model (Radj2=47.16%). We then added tract FW and FAT measures to this model to determine if tract microstructure explained any unique variance beyond covariates and hippocampal volume to executive function performance. For FAT, we found that no tracts were significant contributors to the model. For FW, we found that all tracts (aside from the fornix) were significant contributors to the model and provided increases in the Radj2 (range: 0.73%-1.63%).

We then determined if there were baseline hippocampal x white matter tract interactions on memory and executive performance. The results are presented in Supplemental Table 1, which shows there were no significant interactions between white matter tract FAT or FW and hippocampal volume on baseline memory or executive function performance.

Tract-by-hippocampal Volume Interaction on Longitudinal Memory/Executive Composite

For annual change in memory performance, we found significant interactions between hippocampal volume and FAT in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.043) and cingulum (p=0.025). No significant interactions were found with FW. For annual change in executive function performance, the only significant interaction with hippocampal volume was with fornix FAT (p=0.025). Results for all models can be found in Table 4. Figure 2 provides a summary of our findings for the annual change in memory and executive function. As shown in Figure 2A, lower FAT in the cingulum is associated with a more rapid decline in memory performance, particularly among individuals with baseline neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Figure 2B shows that higher FW in the fornix is associated with a more rapid decline in executive function, particularly among individuals with neurodegeneration in the hippocampus.

Discussion

The present study examined relationships between hippocampal volume and the microstructure of the medial temporal lobe white matter tracts to evaluate how these sensitive imaging metrics relate to cognitive performance and cognitive decline. Specifically, we used FW elimination, an innovative post-processing technique which overcomes the limitations of conventional dMRI, to quantify microstructural values (FW and FAT) in several medial temporal lobe projections, including the cingulum bundle, fornix, tapetum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. We report three main findings. First, we found that FW and FAT in medial temporal lobe tracts were strongly associated with hippocampal volume. Second, we found that baseline measures of medial temporal lobe white matter tract FW were robustly associated with baseline cognitive performance. Competitive model analyses determined that FW in the tapetum, cingulum, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus explained variance above and beyond hippocampal volume and covariates in cognitive performance. Third, we found significant interactions of hippocampal volume and medial temporal lobe white matter tract FAT on longitudinal cognitive trajectory, whereby individuals with lower hippocampal volume and lower white matter tract FAT exhibited greater longitudinal decline. This study therefore provides direct evidence that medial temporal lobe white matter projections are relevant to cognitive performance even when statistically accounting for hippocampal atrophy.

The medial temporal lobe white matter tract microstructure association with memory and executive function performance is consistent with previous reports (Ji et al., 2019; Mielke et al., 2012); however, the mechanisms by which medial temporal lobe microstructure is linked to memory and executive function is unclear. One prevailing hypothesis is that white matter microstructure reflects cerebrovascular damage, and thus would primarily serve as a metric of concomitant disease in the case of early AD (Vemuri et al., 2018). A second possibility is that white-matter abnormalities arise downstream of AD neuropathology or hippocampal sclerosis as a result of Wallerian-degeneration following hippocampal atrophy (Sachdev et al., 2013). Both scenarios seem plausible given previous research suggesting that white matter degeneration may precede noticeable hippocampal atrophy (Hoy et al., 2017; Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2013). While these hypothesized pathways of injury differ in the temporal ordering of white matter damage, the literature consistently reports strong associations between white matter measures and cognitive performance (Bozzali et al., 2012; Mielke et al., 2012). Our results add to this growing body of literature by demonstrating that hippocampal volume synergistically interacts with white matter microstructure to explain longitudinal decline in memory and executive function and highlights the unique contribution of white matter changes in explaining cognitive decline over the course of aging and disease. Future longitudinal studies should determine if white matter decline in aging is independent of neurpathological process, a consequence of hippocampal atrophy, or a combination of these processes.

One interesting observation is that while medial temporal lobe white matter FW is robustly associated with baseline memory and executive function performances, medial temporal lobe FAT interacts with hippocampal volume to explain longitudinal decline in memory and executive function. These two white matter metrics are thought to reflect different neurobiological processes. FW measures unbound water molecules in the white matter, and thus higher FW could reflect a neuroinflammatory or more general axonal damage process (Pasternak et al., 2012). Therefore, the finding that higher FW is associated with lower baseline cognitive performance may reflect a more advanced neurodegenerative state in which atrophy has already impacted the white matter. In contrast, FAT is a more direct measure of white matter microstructure, as it calculates intracellular white matter microstructure, with lower FAT indicating more white matter vulnerability. Thus, while we found that FAT does not appear to be as sensitive to baseline cognitive performance as FW, our findings indicate that individuals with higher white matter vulnerability (i.e., lower FAT) are predisposed to a more rapid disease progression.

The present study has several strengths, including a well-characterized longitudinal cohort and the application of free-water imaging, which overcomes the limitations of conventional dMRI techniques. An additional strength of this study is the incorporation of novel medial temporal lobe white matter tract templates. The use of white matter tract templates increases consistency between studies as the identical voxels are being evaluated in the MNI space. Accordingly, prior studies have implemented white matter tract templates. For example, the most predominantly used white matter tract template, the Johns Hopkins White Matter Tract Atlas, which is a white matter tract atlas based on 28 individuals (resolution: 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 mm) (Hua et al., 2008) and has been used to evaluate microstructural deficits in AD (Araque Caballero et al., 2018; Kantarci et al., 2017). Here, we conducted probabilistic tractography in 100 HCP participants (resolution: 1.25 x 1.25 x 1.25 mm) (Van Essen et al., 2013). Using well-established methods to create white matter tract templates (Archer et al., 2018), we have provided a newly available white matter tract atlas of the uncinate fasciculus, parietal component of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and cingulum. In addition to recently available templates of the fornix (Brown et al., 2017) and tapetum (Archer, D. B. et al., 2019), this atlas provides significantly more coverage of the brain compared to the aforementioned tractography template (see Supplemental Figure 1). Despite these strengths, this study used a cohort which is both highly educated and primarily non-Hispanic white individuals, thus limiting the generalizability to other cohorts. An additional potential limitation is that our dMRI acquisition was single-shell, and therefore, we could not perform advanced multi-compartment models such as NODDI; however, recent studies have shown that the extracellular compartment component derived from NODDI (i.e., VISO) are highly associated with FW. Further, while FW elimination is a novel post-processing technique to quantify both extracellular and intracellular microstructure in a dMRI image, it is still unclear what exact cellular processes contribute to each variable. Still, since our novel medial temporal lobe tract templates are freely available, we are confident that future studies can easily incorporate these into studies and begin to further elucidate these mechanisms.

In conclusion, this study provided compelling evidence that changes in hippocampal volume and FW white matter metrics in tracts projecting from the hippocampus co-occur and synergistically interact. Findings provide additional evidence that AD is a network-level disease, with white matter alterations tightly coupled with gray matter changes, and the downstream consequences of gray matter atrophy. White matter and gray matter metrics of damage are likely complementary, and both should be thoughtfully incorporated into theoretical models of aging and AD.

The medial temporal lobe tract measures which were associated with memory (A) and executive function (B) performance include FW in the cingulum bundle, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus (UF), and inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). The association of ILF FW with memory performance (A) and tapetum FW with executive function performance (B) is shown.

Figure 2 – Baseline Tract x Hippocampal Interaction on Annual Change in Memory and Executive Function.

The medial temporal lobe tract measures which had a significant interaction with hippocampal volume for annual change in memory include FAT in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and cingulum bundle (A). For annual change in executive function performance, temporal tract measures which had a significant interaction with hippocampal volume include FAT in the fornix (B). Hippocampal neurodegeneration groups (negative, positive) are based on a previously identified cutoff value for hippocampal neurodegeneration (positive: volume ≤ 6723 mm3) (Mormino et al., 2014).
