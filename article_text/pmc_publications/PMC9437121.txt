Objective

To investigate the relationship between John Henryism, a psychological traittypified by high-effort active coping that has been associated with adverse health outcomes among Blacks, and cognitive decline.

Methods

In a cohort of community-dwelling older Black adults (N=611), we investigated the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive decline. John Henryism was measured using the John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS), a 9-item validated measure of self-reported high-effort coping (mean=16.9, sd=4.8, range: 4–27). We implemented a three-step modeling process using mixed effect models to assess the relationship between the JHACS and global cognitive function as well as five cognitive domains. We adjusted for demographics and for factors known to be associated with cognitive function and decline including vascular risk factors, discrimination, and income.

Results

The trait of high-effort active coping was associated with lower average cognitive function (β=−0.07, 95% CI: −0.10, −0.03), but not with decline. The results remained after further adjustment for experiences of discrimination, income, and vascular risk factors. In domain specific analyses, we found that the JHACS was associated with baseline levels of working memory, semantic memory and visuospatial ability, but not decline.

Conclusions

These results highlight the importance of using culturally specific measures in considering the heterogeneity of cognitive health outcomes in minoritized populations. Understanding how stress responses relate to late-life cognition among older Black adults could help promote aspects of behavioral resilience along with healthful coping responses.

pmcIntroduction

There is a great deal of evidence linking chronic stress and adverse cognitive health outcomes in older age (1–3). For minoritized populations, it is becoming increasingly recognized that racism, a potent stressor for minoritized individuals, can have both physiological and psychological adverse impacts (4). The consequences of structural racism while living in a racialized society could also contribute to other chronic psychosocial stressors that are more likely to be experienced by Black adults than by any other racial/ethnic groups in the United States (5), including persistent poverty, neighborhood residential segregation, and trauma due to over-policing and mass incarnation (6,7). Moreover, these psychosocial stressors have been shown to have negative effects on late-life brain health among older Black adults (8). Experiences of racism have also been linked to risk factors for cognitive impairment including diabetes, sleep disturbances, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease (9–12), and a growing body of literature suggests that such experiences may negatively impact cognition itself (13,14). Because older Black adults are twice as likely as older White adults to have dementia and cognitive impairment (15), understanding drivers of impairment and disease within the population of older Black adults is paramount to reducing or eliminating disparities.

Despite persistent stress, it is important to maintain physical and psychological wellbeing, and individuals respond to stressful life experiences via a variety of coping mechanisms. The variation in response to stressors could play a role in the relationship of these stressors to adverse health outcomes. Understanding culturally specific responses to systemic stressors that tend to impact certain subgroups of the population, in this case Black people, is important because it can inform culturally targeted interventions and help broaden our understanding of racial disparities in health outcomes. John Henryism is a concept that was developed to describe an active coping disposition to psychological stressors (16), such as systemic racism and interpersonal discrimination. Responses to stressors can be cognitive, affective/emotional, or behavioral; and within each of these, reactions can be active or passive and maladaptive or adaptive (17–19). Self-blame is an example of a passive response whereas active and adaptive responses may allow targets of racism to engage in self-protective and self-comfort tactics in order to cope with the experience. Maladaptive responses may involve cognitive or physical exertions that create stress beyond the initial stressful experience provoking the response (19). As a coping mechanism, John Henryism is a preexisting behavioral disposition that involves over-striving to combat negative stereotypes. As it requires additional exertion and possibly stress beyond the initial psychological stressor, as a response, it is considered maladaptive (19).

The John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS) was developed as a measure to assess this preexisting disposition to psychological stressors. The scale was based on work in both clinic and field based psychology which posited that “high effort” coping characterized by active, determined efforts to respond to environmental stressors, if prolonged, could contribute to frequent sharp elevations in blood pressure. These elevations could lead to a more sustained elevation and eventual dysregulation of blood pressure control and subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes (20–22). Although John Henryism need not be restricted to Black people, because of the cultural specificity of the construct in terms of the discrimination and racism that Black Americans in the United States face, much of the research has been carried out in Black populations (23). As proposed in initial work on John Henryism, most of the health related impacts of the disposition are experienced with cardiovascular outcomes. John Henryism is conceptualized both as a main effect and as an effect modifier for worse outcomes among individuals with low socioeconomic resources, often operationalized as level of education (23–26). Given these associations, there is reason to believe that John Henryism could also be related to late life cognitive health, as cardiovascular disease is a known risk factor for late life cognitive function and decline (27). Elevated blood pressure, in particular, has been extensively linked to poor cognitive function, more rapid decline, and dementia in later life (28). In this study, we consider the John Henryism Active Coping Scale in its relationship to cognitive function and cognitive decline among older Black community dwelling adults. We hypothesize that higher levels of John Henryism will be related to lower levels of cognitive function and faster rates of cognitive decline. We additionally explore whether any observed relationship is stronger for those at lower levels of income.

Methods

Study Participants

Participants were older Black adults from the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of aging in Black adults in the Chicago metropolitan area and surrounding suburbs that started in 2004 (29). The analytic baseline for this analysis is the participant’s first evaluation that included the JHACS, which was added to MARS in 2005. Study participants were non-institutionalized, over the age of 60 and without known dementia. All study participants signed informed consent forms and the MARS was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. At the time of analysis, 787 adults had enrolled and completed a uniform structured baseline clinical evaluation and interview. Of these, 671 also had completed at least one JHACS assessment. The analytic sample is limited to individuals with data on the JHACS, at least two cognitive evaluations, and all covariates described below (N=611).

John Henryism

A modified version of The John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS) was used to assess high-effort coping among MARS participants (JHACS; James, 1983). The JHACS consists of nine statements that reflect self-determination. Examples of included items are, “Hard work is the best way for a person to get ahead in life” or, “Once I make up my mind to do something, I stay with it until the job is completely done.” A full list of the items included in the scale can be found in Table 1. Using a Likert-type scale (range: 0–3), participants indicated whether they felt each statement applied to them. The modified scale ranges from 0–27, with higher scores indicating more active-coping.

Cognitive Function

Each year, participants complete a battery of 19 performance-based tests of cognitive function assessing five domains: episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability. Detailed information on the complete battery has been published elsewhere (29). We used both a measure of global cognitive function, which is created by converting raw scores on each test to Z-scores using baseline mean and SD of the full cohort, and averaging the Z-scores, and measures of each cognitive domain, which are Z-score averages within domains.

Other Risk Factors

All models were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education. Additional adjustments were made for experiences of discrimination, income, and vascular risk. All covariates were measured at the analytic baseline. Discrimination was measured using the Detroit Area Study Everyday Discrimination Scale which consists of 9-items that ask participants the frequency with which they experience interpersonal discrimination in their day-to-day lives (Williams, 1997). Following previous work (31), scores were dichotomized as yes/no for each of the nine items and summed with higher scores indicating more discrimination. Income was measured at baseline via a question which asked participants to select one of ten levels of total family income ($0-$4,999; $5,000 - $9,999; $10,000 - $14,999; $15,000 - $19,999; $20,000 - $24,999; $25,000 - $29,999; $30,000 - $34,999; $35,000 - $49,999; $50,000 - $74,999; $75,000 and over). Income scores ranged from 1–10, with ten indicating the highest level. Vascular risk factors are represented using a 3-point scale where one point is allocated for each item that the participant endorses: history of hypertension, history of diabetes, and history of smoking.

Statistical Analyses

We first examined bivariate associations between John Henryism and key participant characteristics including demographics (age, sex, education), income, discrimination, and vascular risk factors using correlations or independent sample t-tests as appropriate. We then used mixed-effects models to assess the relationship of John Henryism with baseline level of cognition and rate of annual change. We modeled global cognition and each of the five cognitive domains in separate sets of models, the progression of which is described below.

The core model includes terms for demographics (age, sex, and education), time in years since the analytic baseline, and interaction terms for each demographic characteristic with time. Age and education are mean centered. The predictors of interest are the John Henryism score, which is standardized, and an interaction between John Henryism and time. The term for John Henryism indicates the average difference in baseline cognition for a one standard deviation (SD) increase in the John Henryism score. The interaction term for John Henryism with time indicates the modeled impact of a one SD increase on the John Henryism scale on the annual rate of change in cognitive function. Model 2 is additionally adjusted for income, experiences of discrimination, and vascular risk factors; covariates known to be associated with cognitive function and/or decline. In addition to these covariates, additional interaction terms for each covariate by time are also included. Model 3 includes additional interaction terms for income by John Henryism and for income by time by John Henryism in order to assess whether any observed relationship between John Henryism and cognition or John Henryism and cognitive decline varies by income. We additionally present fully adjusted models (including demographics, income, discrimination, and vascular risk factors) for each cognitive domain.

We conducted three sensitivity analyses. First, we represented John Henryism as a binary variable, cut at the median point in the distribution, as has been done in previous analyses (25). There is some evidence that retest learning (improved cognitive performance due to repeated test administration) most often occurs between the first and second administration. To assess whether retest learning impacted any observed association, we performed a sensitivity analysis omitting the analytic baseline evaluation (32,33). There is also evidence that John Henryism is positively correlated with depressive symptoms, and depression is a known risk factor for late life cognitive health including cognitive decline (34,35). For our third sensitivity analysis, we assessed whether including depressive symptoms in models impacted any observed relationship between John Henryism and cognitive function or decline. Depressive symptoms were measured with ten items from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (36). For estimates of association in all models, we use a type 1 error rate of 0.05 to indicate statistical significance. All analyses were programmed using Stata/SE (Stata Corp. 2019. Stata Statistical Software: Release 16. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC.)

Results

Sample Characteristics

Sample characteristics are presented in Table 2. The average age was just under 75 years and most of the sample was female. Average level of education completed was 15 years. All but ten percent of the sample had history of at least one vascular risk factor (smoking, hypertension, or diabetes) and of those, almost 90% had hypertension (482 of 547 with at least one risk factor). Baseline global cognitive function ranged from −2.07 to 1.78 (mean: 0.08, sd: 0.58). Just over half of the sample reported experiencing at least some discrimination, though the median score was one on a scale of 0 to 9.

The average score on the John Henryism scale was 16.9 (sd: 4.8). The distribution of scores on the scale met statistical criteria for a normal distribution (see Figure 1), however there were no scores below 4 (i.e. everyone endorsed at least two items) and a higher than expected number of individuals endorsed the highest level of all items on the scale (n=22). The most endorsed item in the scale was “Once I make up my mind to do something I stay with it until the job is completely done,” with 97.5% of the sample saying that this was at least “a little true.” This was closely followed by “I’ve always felt that I could make of my life pretty much what I wanted to make of it,” with 96.4% endorsement. Table 1 contains full descriptive statistics of scores by item and overall for the John Henryism scale.

Scores on the John Henryism scale were slightly higher in men than in women (17.7 vs 16.7, p=0.03). The score was negatively correlated with age (r=−0.09, p=0.03) and level of global cognition (r=−0.09, p=0.02). John Henryism was not correlated with education (r=−0.03, p=0.47), discrimination (r=−0.00, p=0.93), nor with the vascular risk score (r=0.01, p=0.84).

Level of Baseline Cognition

In the core model, which controlled for demographics including age, sex, and level of education, higher levels of John Henryism were related to lower baseline global cognitive function such that one standard deviation change in John Henryism resulted in a 0.07 unit lower z-score on the level of global cognitive function at baseline (β=−0.07, 95% CI: −0.11, −0.03). This estimate of association was about twice the magnitude of association for each additional year of age (β=−0.04, 95% CI: −0.04, −0.03). When discrimination, income, and the vascular risk factor score were added to the model, the association was unchanged (Table 3). There was no evidence of a difference in the relationship between level of John Henryism and baseline global cognitive function by income (β for interaction=0.00, 95% CI: −0.00, 0.01).

In five additional sets of models, we examined each cognitive domain (episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability) individually as an outcome. In fully adjusted models, higher levels of John Henryism were associated with lower baseline cognitive scores in semantic memory, working memory, and visuospatial ability (Table 4).

Cognitive Change

There was no evidence that level of John Henryism was related to cognitive change over time. This remained true across all models. Additionally, there was not evidence that level of John Henryism related to domain specific cognitive change over time.

Sensitivity Analyses

In prior literature, the JHACS is often modeled as a dichotomous variable, cut at the median of the sample distribution (16,25). To facilitate comparisons with prior literature, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of global cognition where the JHACS was cut at the median value of 17 and modeled as a dichotomous variable. Associations were similar to the main models. Those with high scores on the JHACS had lower global cognitive function at baseline compared to those with lower JHACS scores. There was no relationship between the dichotomous JHACS score and cognitive change over time.

In our sensitivity analysis to evaluate whether any observed association between John Henryism and cognitive change was influenced by retest learning, we still found that the JHACS and cognitive change were unrelated (not shown). Finally, including depressive symptoms (CES-D score) in our models did not change the association of John Henryism with cognitive function (not shown).

Discussion

In this study, we examined the relationship between a disposition of high-effort active coping to psychological stressors and cognitive function and decline among 611 older Black adults. We found that higher levels of high-effort coping, as represented by the John Henryism Active Coping Scale (JHACS) was associated with lower levels of cognitive function at baseline. When modeling individual cognitive domains, this association was observed for the domains of semantic memory, working memory, and visuospatial ability. There was no association between high-effort active coping and rate of cognitive decline. Further, we did not find that the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive function or decline varied by socioeconomic resources, here represented by income.

This work furthers the research on John Henryism in three important ways. First, it considers the impact of John Henryism Active Coping in an older Black cohort. Most of the literature on John Henryism and health has focused on cardiovascular outcomes in young or middle aged adults (23). The few studies of older adults have looked at specific outcomes such as cancer, medication adherence, and cortisol levels (37–39). Given that responses to stressful life events may vary throughout the life course; this study makes an important contribution in its focus on older adults. Second, this is the first study that we know of that considers the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive function and decline. While there is evidence that stress can effect late life cognitive function and decline (40), possibly through a cardiovascular pathway (41), there is no work on the heterogeneity of dispositions to stressful life events and how that might influence later life cognitive outcomes. Lastly, this study further contributes to the small but important literature on culturally specific measures through which to understand heterogeneity of age-related health outcomes in populations that are disproportionately impacted by disease burden (22,42). Understanding stress responses for older Black adults could provide information for targeted interventions to promote culturally relevant and healthful coping responses such as meditation, prayer, and exercise (43,44).

The mechanism by which John Henryism is related to level of global cognition in community dwelling, older Black adults is not known. We examined prior hypotheses of vascular risk factors, discrimination, and income and did not find that they explained the association of John Henryism with level of global cognitive function. Although cognitive domains are interdependent, there is evidence that impairment and decline in older age in certain domains is more likely and associated with different risk factors. Based on previous work relating stress to cognitive outcomes in older Black adults, we would have hypothesized that higher levels of active coping for stress would be related with episodic memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability (31,40). However, while an effect for visuospatial ability was replicated, we also found that the effect of John Henryism on cognition was associated with working memory and semantic memory. There is literature that shows that acute stress impacts working memory in older adults; much of this work is lab based (45,46). More work will need to be done to investigate these domain specific relationships. Prior literature has examined the concept of chronic stress as the mechanism of John Henryism with blood pressure and other cardiovascular outcomes (23,26). To address whether our observed association between JHACS and cognitive function could be due to cardiometabolic dysregulation, we adjusted for vascular risk factors, including hypertension. This did not change the magnitude of association between John Henryism and cognitive function. However, our composite measure of self-reported vascular risk factors may not have been sensitive enough; future studies with better measures of cardiovascular health will need to be done to further explore this pathway. Although we have previously reported in this sample that discrimination is related to cognitive function (31), we did not find that including our measure of discrimination in models changed the association of John Henryism and cognitive function, which could imply that experiences of discrimination and John Henryism are unrelated. However, the Everyday Discrimination scale focuses on daily interpersonal interactions as the sources of experiences of discrimination, so may not capture long standing structural inequalities that create more challenges and burdens for older Black adults (30). Additionally, experiences of interpersonal discrimination become less frequent and/or potent with age, as older adults prune their social networks, retire from the workforce where these experiences are more common, and generally tend to report a more positive outlook on life (47–49).

James’ initial studies put forth that the negative impact of John Henryism on blood pressure and cardiovascular health would be greater for those with fewer socioeconomic resources, originally operationalized as education (24,25). However, findings have been mixed for this interactive effect; outside of James’ initial investigations, there has been more consistent evidence of John Henryism as a main effect on adverse health outcomes including hypertension and cardiovascular reactivity (23). We did not observe any effect modification in the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive function by level of income; our findings lend support for the hypothesis that John Henryism is associated with negative health outcomes, regardless of socioeconomic status (SES). However, it is possible that there is an interactive relationship between John Henryism and SES on cognition, but the MARS cohort represents a more resourced segment of the Black population in the US, so may not represent sufficient variability in the analytic sample to observe variation in the relationship across a larger SES distribution. Also, income may not be the best measure of SES to capture potential resources to aid coping among older Black adults (50). Our study population is from Chicago and the surrounding area – a region of the country which has a number of middle to upper class Black adults. However, most are heavily concentrated on the South Side of the city, an area characterized by extreme racial segregation which has been generationally underserved and who may not be able to readily access potential resources that would be available to White adults with similar income (51).

In our analyses, high-effort active coping was only associated with level of cognition at baseline and not change in cognitive function over time. This could suggest that while high levels of John Henryism are associated with performance on tests of cognitive function, they may not be a marker of the underlying disease which leads to cognitive decline. While behavioral factors, such as loneliness and purpose in life, have been shown to be associated with cognitive decline in Whites, there is less evidence that they are associated with decline in Blacks (52,53). This could be because they are truly not associated with cognitive decline, but it is also possible that there are other factors unique to the cognitive health of older Black adults that are more strongly associated with decline, such as underlying health (54) and perceived stress (40), making the relative contribution of behavioral factors harder to detect. However, even if high effort active coping is not related to cognitive decline in this cohort, it still influences the starting point at which older Black adults start their cognitive aging process, and so plays a role in when they meet threshold criteria for cognitive impairment or dementia. There is evidence that other known risk factors for dementia, such as education, also exhibit a similar relationship to level but not decline of cognitive function (55).

There are several strengths to this study that reinforce confidence in our findings. It was carried out in a large community-based cohort of Black older adults and those in the analytic sample were followed over an average of 7.19 years (range: 2 to 16 years). This allowed us to look at not only the relationship between John Henryism and cognitive function, but also cognitive decline. Follow-up in this study is very high, with over 90% of respondents continuing participation after initial baseline interview. We were able to not only consider global cognitive function, but also specific cognitive domains over the follow-up period. Finally, the JHACS has been shown to represent unique coping behaviors for older Black adults (56), making it a culturally relevant tool to assess heterogeneity in individual behavioral dispositions to stress in this cohort. While there is evidence that active coping can be associated with positive health outcomes (57,58), many of these studies are conducted in predominately White populations. Given the evidence of racial/ethnic differences in coping styles (59), our study further highlights that findings in White populations may not translate to diverse populations. However, there are some limitations that must also be addressed. First, participants are from a volunteer-cohort of more highly educated Black adults in the greater Chicago area and so may not be representative of the full distribution of SES within the Black population across the US. Second, while we were able to assess both cognitive function and cognitive decline over a long follow-up period, because only a small number of individuals have developed incident dementia, we did not look at dementia as an outcome. As more data accrue, it will be important to investigate the association between high-effort active coping and incident disease. Finally, as previously stated, our measure of income may not fully capture socioeconomic resources that may blunt the harmful impact of individual high effort active coping in response to life stressors.

This study is an important step in considering culturally relevant measures of behavior to help understand the etiology of cognitive health outcomes in context for older Black adults in the United States. Further work needs to be done to consider the role of systemic and structural inequities and subsequent individual stress and behavioral dispositions to stress in late life cognitive health for older Black adults.
