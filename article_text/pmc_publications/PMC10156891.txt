Introduction:

African Americans (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) differ in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevalence, risk factors, and symptomatic presentation and AAs are less likely to enroll in AD clinical trials.

Methods:

We conducted race-conscious pharmacoepidemiologic studies of 5.62 million older individuals (age ≥60) to investigate the association of telmisartan exposure and AD outcome using Cox analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, and log-rank test. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of large ethnically diverse genetic data to test likely causal relationships between telmisartan’s target and AD.

Results:

We identified that moderate/high telmisartan exposure was significantly associated with a reduced incidence of AD in the AAs compared to low/no telmisartan exposure (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65–0.91, p-value = 0.0022), but not in the non-Hispanic EAs (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89–1.05, p-value = 0.4110). Sensitivity and sex-/age-stratified patient subgroup analyses identified that telmisartan’s medication possession ratio (MPR) and average hypertension daily dosage were significantly associated with a stronger reduction in the incidence of both AD and dementia in AAs. Using MR analysis from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (over 2 million individuals) across AD, hypertension, and diabetes, we further identified AA-specific beneficial effects of telmisartan for AD.

Discussion:

Randomized controlled trials with ethnically diverse patient cohorts are warranted to establish causality and therapeutic outcomes of telmisartan and AD.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), described almost 120 years ago by Alois Alzheimer and Oskar Fischer,1 is a highly prevalent and progressive neurodegenerative disorder with gradual cognitive decline and memory loss.2,3 Currently, there are more than 6 million older (i.e., age ≥65 years) American adults living with AD.4 Additionally, approximately 24 million older American men have an 11.6% lifetime risk for developing AD, and approximately 30 million older American women have a 21.1% lifetime risk for developing AD.4 Older African American (AA) adults have a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk for developing AD, compared with older non-Hispanic European American (EA) adults.5,6 The failure rate for AD clinical trials (2002–2012) is estimated at 99.6%, and there is a profound lack of effective disease-modifying treatments for AD.7 Despite the magnitude of the problem, until very recently only five medicines had ever been approved for AD treatment.8 These five therapies are limited primarily to acetylcholine or N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamatergic mechanisms.8 Unfortunately, these medicines provide only modest benefits in symptom management and do not halt or slow disease progression. The recent accelerated Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Aducanumab (Aduhelm), the first amyloid beta (Aβ)-directed antibody therapy provides a new therapy for a narrow segment of the AD population, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia.9,10 Without more new and effective AD medicines, society will soon face a devastating humanitarian crisis. To avert the calamity, we need to diversify AD-related targets and identify new candidate therapies.

Vascular diseases (in particular hypertension [HTN]),11 chronic kidney disease (CKD),12 and diabetes,13 are risk factors for AD and dementias. These risk factors are disproportionately more prevalent in older AA adults than older non-Hispanic EA adults.6 AA individuals have worse blood pressure control compared to non-Hispanic EA individuals,14 while intensive blood pressure control (i.e., controlling blood pressure at &lt;120 mm Hg) has been shown to reduce risk of MCI.15 A large genetic study has shown that renal development is significantly mediated by AD-associated loci in the AAs, compared to the non-Hispanic EAs.16 Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is markedly less robust in healthy young AA adults than in their EA counterparts.17 Specifically, AA adults have a greater aldosterone sensitivity than EA adults.18 Older patients on hemodialysis are also at substantial risk for dementia and AD.19 Unfortunately, the AA population is under-represented in most clinical trials, including AD.20,21 Exploring race-specific responses to medicine is an important area that could improve the lives of a diverse group of patients. Thus, it is crucial to identify race-conscious effects of medicines using large real-world patient datasets and genetic data from ethnically diverse populations.

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are potent RAAS-acting antihypertensive drugs that are generally well-tolerated.22 Among all FDA-approved ARBs, telmisartan is the only ARB drug acting as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ).23 Meta-analysis showed that telmisartan had favorable clinical benefits for patients with T2D and CKD, compared to other ARBs.24 Animal models showed that telmisartan’s PPAR agonistic activity reduces cognitive decline.25 We, therefore, wondered whether telmisartan could protect against AD, especially in the AA population with higher prevalence of HTN, T2D, and CKD.6 In this study, we conducted pharmacoepidemiologic studies of ethnically diverse (i.e., non-Hispanic EA and AA individuals) data to investigate the relationship between telmisartan use and AD outcome using a large-scale United States (US) insurance claim dataset, including over 5.6 million older individuals with age ≥60 years and continuous enrollment duration ≥3 years. We identified telmisartan as a potential repurposable drug for AD in the AA population after adjusting various confounding factors using propensity score (PS) and nearest-neighbor matching approaches. We further investigated the likely causal relationship of AA-specific reduced incidence of AD by telmisartan using drug target-based Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis from large, ethnically diverse genome-wide association studies (GWAS) across AD, HTN, and diabetes.

2 | METHOD

2.1 | Insurance claim data

We used OPTUM Clinformatics Data (2007Q1-2020Q4) derived from commercially insured US individuals and the US Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. The data included individual demographics (e.g., sex, year of birth, and race), monthly enrollment records, medical claims, procedure claims, pharmacy claims, selected laboratory results, and death records. We screened 5.62 million individuals with age ≥60 years and continuous enrollment duration ≥3 years. We included 583,941 non-Hispanic EA ARB users and 115,394 AA ARB users.

2.2 | Ascertainment of outcome, exposure, and covariates from patient data

We used a well-established phenotype coding algorithm26 to define AD outcomes (i.e., ICD-9 331.0; ICD-10: F00*, G30* [Table S1 in supporting information]). A recent study determined that these codes had a positive predictive value (PPV) = 74.8 (95% CI: 73.1–76.4) and sensitivity = 71.4 (95% CI: 69.6–73.0).27 We used the R package comorbidit to define dementia.28 The primary outcome was the time from starting date of insurance enrollment (i.e., day 0) to the earliest diagnosis date of AD. The secondary outcome was time from date of insurance enrollment to the earliest diagnosis date of dementia. Individuals without any outcome were censored at the last date of enrollment or on 12/31/2020, whichever came first.

Pharmacy orders of ARBs were identified from the drug name dictionary provided by OPTUM. We included the following ARBs: azilsartan, candesartan, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan. We computed the medication possession ratio (MPR) for ARBs (including telmisartan) and MPR for telmisartan, separately. The MPR is defined as the proportion of medication days during the total follow-up period, where the total follow-up period is defined from starting date of enrollment to event/censoring date. We used the algorithm derived by Min et al. to define the average HTN daily dose (HDD) of telmisartan.29 HDD of telmisartan is defined as 40 mg/daily.29 The average HDD of telmisartan is defined as the total HDD of telmisartan over total follow-up days.

We incorporated comorbidities common among older adults and/or associated with AD and dementia. We used alcohol-related diagnosis codes defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to identify alcohol use disorder.30 We used the R package comorbidit to define various chronic conditions, including cancer, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart disease (myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure), liver disease, and renal disease. We used the algorithm developed by Yang et al.31 to define Parkinson’s disease, the algorithm derived by Chen et al.32 to define fall and HTN, the algorithm derived by Quan et al.33 to define depression, and the algorithm derived by Anna Nordström and Peter Nordström34 to define traumatic brain injury (TBI).

2.3 | Study design and statistical analysis

In the retrospective cohort study, we included non-Hispanic EA individuals and AA individuals (Figure S1 in supporting information) that were: (1) ≥60 years old on the first day of enrollment; (2) continuously enrolled for ≥3 years; and (3) had an MPR of ARBs &gt;0.25.

First, we conducted PS matching between individuals with moderate/high telmisartan exposure (MPR of telmisartan &gt;0.25) and individuals with low/no telmisartan exposure (MPR of telmisartan ≤0.25). We used the R packages Matchlt and optmatch to derive 1:4 PS-matched cohorts for non-Hispanic EAs, as well as for AAs.35,36 We used the nearest-neighbor matching method for PS matching. The PS matching was based on age, gender, alcohol use disorder (yes/no), cancer (yes/no), cerebrovascular disease (yes/no), chronic pulmonary disease (yes/no), depression (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), fall (yes/no), heart disease (yes/no), liver disease (yes/no), Parkinson’s disease (yes/no), renal disease (yes/no), and TBI (yes/no). We analyzed the PS-matched cohort and conducted Cox analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, and log-rank test.37–39 We conducted sensitivity multivariate Cox analyses and age-/gender-stratified multivariate Cox analyses to investigate the associations between: (1) MPR of telmisartan and AD and (2) average HDD of telmisartan and AD. Expanded detail of the analytical models are provided in Table S2. The rationale for conducting multiple analyses (e.g., moderate/high exposure analysis, MPR analysis, and average HDD analysis) is to implement complementary approaches to studying on the relationship between telmisartan and AD outcomes with respect to relative high exposure, and frequency and strength of exposure. The rationale for conducting age-/gender-stratified sensitivity analyses is to adjust differences of life expectancy due to age and gender.

We further investigated the relationship between use of telmisartan and dementia. Similar to the primary analysis, we conducted Cox analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, and log-rank test using the PS-matched cohorts.37–39 We conducted multivariate Cox analyses and age-/gender-stratified multivariate Cox analyses to investigate the associations between: (1) MPR of telmisartan and dementia and (2) average HDD of telmisartan and dementia. In addition, we performed an active user-design approach by deriving a telmisartan and/or lisinopril user cohort (i.e., users with MPR of telmisartan and/or lisinopril &gt;0.25). Similar to the above primary and secondary analyses, we conducted Cox analysis, Kaplan–Meier analysis, and log-rank test using the PS-matched cohorts as well.37–39 We conducted multivariate Cox analyses and age-/gender-stratified multivariate Cox analyses to investigate the associations between: (1) MPR of telmisartan and AD and (2) average HDD of telmisartan and AD. All analyses were conducted in R 4.1.1.

2.4 | Instrument selection of Mendelian randomization

We focused on PPAR-γ encoded by gene PPARG as PPAR-γ is a distinct target for telmisartan compared to other ARBs. The instruments of PPARG were selected from two types of publicly available sources: (1) cis-eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) based instrument variable and (2) genome-wide instrument variables of PPARG. The eQTL instrument source is publicly available from the AD Knowledge Portal40 (Synapse ID: syn17015233). We selected PPARG associated significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in eQTL data (SNP n = 1, FDR = 0.047, Table S3 in supporting information) as instrumental variable for MR analysis. For the second source, we tested genome-wide PPARG instrument variables from large GWAS datasets (Table S3 in supporting information): (1) HTN41 (including systolic blood pressure [SBP] trait [GWAS catalog ID: GCST90000062] and pulse pressure [PP] trait [GWAS catalog ID: GCST90000061]) and (2) type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) cohorts42 (GWAS catalog ID: GCST90018926). Instrumental variables within the PPARG ±50 kb were selected based on a gnome-wide significant SNPs in T2D (SNPs n = 6, p-value &lt;5 × 10−8, Table S3 in supporting information), HTN trait SBP (SNP n = 1, p-value = 7.55 × 10−6), and HTN trait PP (SNP n = 1, p-value = 1.77 × 10−11), and minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt;0.01. In addition, we used CKD as an exposure trait to test its effect with AD. We utilized top genetic evidence supported CKD-associated genes from the Opentarget43 database (overall Association Score &gt;0.2 with Genetic Association data, Table S4 in supporting information). We then used all genome-wide significant SNPs (n = 10, p-value &lt;5 × 10−8 in HTN-SBP GWAS) located in ±50 kb of CKD-associated genes as instrument variables to test MR for AD. Based on a previous study,44 F statistic &gt;10 was used to qualify valid instrument variables from GWAS summary statistic datasets. The F-statistic of one IV from eQTL dataset equal to 9.64, slightly lower than 10. For all three of these sources of instrument variables, we clumped LD (linkage disequilibrium) to r2 &lt; 0.2 based on reference matrices from 1000 genome V3 by PLINK45 [v1.9].

2.5 | Mendelian randomization

We selected three AD GWAS summary statistic datasets as AD outcomes in MR analysis: (1) AA-specific AD cohort16 with 2,784 AA AD cases and 5,222 healthy controls; (2) EA1, a European ancestry AD cohort46,47 with 53,042 European AD cases and 355,900 healthy controls (GWAS catalog ID: GCST90012877); and (3) EA2, the second European ancestry AD cohort with 24,087 late-onset AD cases, 47,793 family history of AD, and 383,378 healthy controls (GWAS catalog ID: GCST007320). We conducted MR analyses using the R (R 4.1.1) package TwoSampleMR (https://mrcieu.github.io/TwoSampleMR/). The inverse-variance-weighted48 (IVW) MR was used to test the number of proposed instrument variables more than once, and Wald ratio estimator49 was applied to instruments with only one variant. For sensitivity analyses, the Cochran’s Q test (p-value &gt;0.05 and I2 &lt;0.5) was used to test IVs heterogeneity. When the Cochran’s Q p-value &lt;0.05 and I2 &gt; 0.5, we conducted an additional robust IVW model to correct for the influence from outlier IVs. Furthermore, the MR-PRESSO50 and weighted median method51 was used to detect potential horizontal pleiotropy and correct outlier contamination.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Telmisartan usage is associated with reduced risk of AD in both AA ARBs user cohort and AA telmisartan/lisinopril user cohort

After screening 5.62 million older individuals (≥60 years old and ≥3 years of enrollment, Figure S1 in supporting information), the whole study dataset included 583,941 non-Hispanic EA individuals with MPR of ARBs &gt;0.25 and 115,394 AA individuals with MPR of ARBs &gt;0.25. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the whole study dataset and users of telmisartan. The PS-matched non-Hispanic EA cohort included 85,640 individuals (17,128 with MPR of telmisartan &gt;0.25 and 68,512 with MPR of telmisartan ≤0.25). The PS-matched AA cohort included 21,220 individuals (4244 with MPR of telmisartan &gt;0.25 and 16,976 MPR of telmisartan ≤0.25). Demographics of PS-matched cohorts are presented in Table S5.

Figure 1 shows the hazard ratios (HRs) from PS-matched Cox analyses and multivariate Cox analyses. We found that moderate/high telmisartan exposure (i.e., MPR of telmisartan &gt;0.25) was associated with reduced risk of AD (HR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65–0.91, p-value = 0.0022) and dementia (HR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.74–0.91, p-value = 0.0003) in the AA population compared to low/no telmisartan exposure (i.e., MPR of telmisartan ≤0.25), but not with reduced risk of AD (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.89–1.05, p-value = 0.4110) or dementia (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.93–1.04, p-value = 0.5419) in the non-Hispanic EA population (Figure 1A). Additionally, MPR and average HDD of telmisartan were significantly associated with reduced risk of AD in the AA population (HRs ≤0.77, p-values ≤0.0013), but not associated with reduced risk of AD in the non-Hispanic EA population as well (Figure 1B,C). MPR and average HDD of telmisartan were associated with reduced risk of dementia in both AA and non-Hispanic EA populations (HRs ≤0.85, p-values &lt;0.0001). The clinically meaningful effect size (lower HR) of MPR and average HDD for both AD (HRs ≤ 0.77) and dementia (HRs ≤ 0.70) is stronger in the AA population compared with the non-Hispanic EA population (HRs ≥ 0.74). Full results of multivariate Cox analyses are presented in Tables S6–S9.

Figure 2 presents the cumulative incidence of AD and dementia after insurance enrollment for PS-matched cohorts. The AA population with moderate/high telmisartan exposure (i.e., MPR of telmisartan &gt;0.25) showed a significantly lower cumulative incidence of AD or dementia (p-values ≤0.01) compared to low/no telmisartan exposure (i.e., MPR of telmisartan ≤0.25). Indeed, the 5-year cumulative incidence of AD is 2.5% for the AA individuals with moderate/high telmisartan exposure and 3.8% for AA population with low/no telmisartan exposure. Furthermore, the 5-year cumulative incidence of dementia is 6.3% for the AA population with moderate/high telmisartan exposure and 8.6% for the AA population with low/no telmisartan exposure. In the non-Hispanic EA population, by contrast, the 5-year cumulative incidence of AD and dementia were similar between individuals with moderate/high telmisartan exposure and individuals with low/no telmisartan exposure.

3.2 | Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

To adjust differences of life expectancy due to age and gender, we next turned to conduct age-/gender-stratified multivariate Cox analyses (Figure 3). The results from stratified Cox analyses were consistent with the results from the unstratified analysis. MPR and average HDD of telmisartan were significantly associated with reduced risk of AD in the AA population (HRs ≤ 0.76, p-values ≤0.0007), but not with reduced risk of AD in the non-Hispanic EA population (Figure 3A,B). The clinically meaningful effect size (lower HR) of MPR and average HDD for both AD (HRs ≤ 0.76) and dementia (HRs ≤ 0.70) is stronger in the AA population compared with the non-Hispanic EA population (HRs ≥ 0.74). Full results of multivariate Cox analyses are presented in Tables S10–S13. Figure 3C presents additional analyses of the telmisartan and/or lisinopril cohort (an active-comparator design52). Telmisartan use was associated with reduced risk of AD in both AA and non-Hispanic EA individuals (AA HRs ≤ 0.68 [p-values ≤0.0001, non-Hispanic EA HRs ≤ 0.85 [p-values ≤0.0001]). The HRs were consistently lower in the AAs compared with the non-Hispanic EAs. Full results of multivariate Cox analyses are presented in the Tables S14–S18. Altogether, these comprehensive subgroup and sensitivity analyses further demonstrated that telmisartan exposure was significantly associated with reduced risk of AD in the AA individuals.

3.3 | Mendelian randomization analysis

As health insurance claim data analysis cannot establish the causal relationship between telmisartan use and the reduced risk of AD, we further performed drug target-based genetic MR53 analysis (see methods). Telmisartan has both antagonistic activity at the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (encoded by AGTR1) and agonistic activity on PPAR-γ (encoded by PPARG).54,55 However, we found no reported AD loci on AGTR1 after searching various AD GWAS.46,47 We thus performed MR analysis to validate the genetic perturbation of PPAR-γ on AD outcome in both AA and EA populations. Using rs7302906940 as instruments, we found that one significant PPAR-γ eQTL showed a protective effect for AD (β = −1.30, 95% CI −2.44 to −0.16, p-value = 0.0251 Wald ratio MR) in AAs, yet not in two independent European cohorts (Figure 4A). This AA-specific protective effect of PPAR-γ is consistent with a significantly reduced risk of AD for usage of telmisartan, a PPAR-γ agonist (Figures 1–3). To test whether telmisartan had superior efficacy in individuals with HTN or T2D, we further performed MR analysis using the genome-wide significant lead SNPs of PPARG in HTN (including two genetic traits, SBP and PP) and T2D populations as instrumental variables. We found that PPAR-γ showed a protective effect for AD (β = −1.57, 95% CI −2.16 to −0.53, p-value = 0.0031 Weight Median MR, Figure 4B) in AAs with T2D. We found a similar trend that PPAR-γ showed a protective effect for AD in AAs with HTN, although this did not achieve statistical significance (p-value = 0.1343, Figure 4B). One possible explanation for lack of significance is the relatively small sample size in AAs (2,748 AD cases and 5,222 healthy controls). However, PPAR-γ showed no protective effect for AD in two independent European cohorts with larger sample size (Figure 4B).

Several clinical studies have shown that CKD is significantly associated with an elevated risk of AD and dementia, and telmisartan has demonstrated more clinical benefits for potential treatment of CKD compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and other ARBs.16,56–58 Our MR analysis showed that elevated expression of CKD-associated genes (F-statistic &gt; 10 and p-value &lt;5 × 10−8, Table S4 in supporting information) have protective effects on AD in AAs using inverse variance weighted MR (β = −1.60, 95% CI −3.19 to −0.01, p-value = 0.0481 Figure 4B) and MR-PRESSO (β = −1.60, 95% CI −3.03 to −0.18, p-value = 0.0337, Figure S2 in supporting information). Genetic or human genome studies have shown that CKD-associated genes are often loss-of-function variants,59–61 including SHROOM3,62 WDR72,63 and ADRB1.64 Thus, prevention or treatment of CKD by targeting CKD-associated genes may have protective effects in AD or dementia, particularly for AA individuals. Whereas CKD-associated genes showed no protective effect for risk of AD in two independent European cohorts (EA1, β = −0.21, 95% CI −0.53 to 0.12; EA2, β = −0.04, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.04, inverse variance weighted MR, Figure 4B). Altogether, these comprehensive MR analyses indicate that telmisartan usage confers specific beneficial effects on HTN, T2D, and CKD in the AA individuals (Figure 4), consistent with AA-specific protective effects of telmisartan on AD and dementia in health insurance claims data (Figures 1–3).

4 | DISCUSSION

Using state-of-the-art retrospective cohort design analyses, we demonstrated that moderate/high telmisartan exposure was significantly associated with reduced risk of AD and dementia in the AAs. Using PS-matched telmisartan users and lisinopril (an ACEI) active-comparator users, we showed that telmisartan use was associated with a more strongly reduced risk of AD and dementia in the AAs than in the non-Hispanic EAs. Additionally, both unstratified and age-/gender-stratified multivariate Cox analyses confirmed that both greater MPR and average HDD of telmisartan were associated with reduced risk of AD in the AAs as well. All analyses demonstrated a consistent pattern that telmisartan exposure was associated with more significant protection against AD or dementia outcomes in the AA population, relative to the non-Hispanic EA population, while the differential effect sizes could be a consequence of differential study populations and models (Table S2 in supporting information). Using ethnically diverse genetic data and MR analysis, we showed that PPAR-γ (a unique target of telmisartan compared to other ARBs) was significantly associated with protective effect of AD in AA individuals with T2D, HTN, and/or CKD, genetically supporting an AA-specific beneficial effect of telmisartan for AD. In summary, our population-based discovery and MR analyses suggest that telmisartan offers a potential treatment for AD and dementia with uniquely specific efficacy in the AA people.

Telmisartan is an ARB that lacks angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. We found that telmisartan usage was associated with a more strongly reduced risk of AD in the AA population compared to usage of lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor). In addition, telmisartan improves carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by virtue of its agonist property at PPAR-γ,which mitigates the severity of diabetes and inflammation. Our MR analysis revealed that PPAR-γ variants confer AA-specific AD protective effects for individuals with T2D, HTN, and/or CKD, genetically supporting a beneficial effect of PPAR-γ agonists (i.e., telmisartan) in the potential prevention or treatment of AD. Population studies show that usage of pioglitazone (a PPAR-γ agonist medication for T2D) was associated with reduced risk of dementia.65–67 Recent studies have shown that usage of pioglitazone and/or lobeglitazone (another PPAR-γ agonist medication for T2D) is associated with reduced risk of AD as well.68,69 However, pioglitazone didn’t show significant clinical benefits for patients with mild to moderate AD in a large phase II study (NCT00982202) and a phase III trial (NCT01931566) with non-Hispanic or Latino, White participants.70 We note that our MR analysis here shows that PPAR-γ variants have uniquely protective effects on AD outcome in the AA population. This finding could guide design of future clinical trials of PPAR-γ agonists in AD. For example, including ethnically diverse population, including AA people, may be crucial to test the clinical benefits of PPAR-γ agonists (i.e., pioglitazone70 and telmisartan [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02471833]) in the future clinical trials.

A larger clinically effect size of telmisartan in reducing the risk of AD and dementia (Figures 1 and 3) may be due to its additional beneficial effects on kidney dysfunction. Notably, a recent genetic study using the Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium identified the renal system as an important new pathway impacted by AD risk loci in the AA population16. Our MR analysis supports the protective effects of loci on CKD-associated genes in AA individuals, but not in non-Hispanic EA individuals. Clinical studies have shown that kidney dysfunction is associated with an elevated risk of AD and dementia in AA individuals.19 Telmisartan has shown clinical benefits for kidney dysfunction.56–58 Thus, the AA-specific treatment effects of telmisartan in AD may be explained by its multi-target effects, including beneficial effects on anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, and kidney protection.

Preclinical studies have shown that telmisartan mitigates cognitive decline through PPAR-γ activation, independently of its blood pressure-lowering effect. Telmisartan is able to cross human blood brain barrier,71 and even at low doses this agent reduces accumulation of cellular amyloid beta peptide (Ab) and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau), as well as neuro-inflammation, in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats.72,73 Telmisartan also suppressed neuronal apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in a hyperglycemic ovariectomized rat model, which may explain its beneficial effects in AD patients.74–76 These preclinical studies mechanistically supported telmisartan’s beneficial effects in AD by multiple mechanisms, including neuroprotection, anti-inflammation, and reduction of oxidative stress. However, the mechanism-of-action and target engagement of telmisartan warrant further studies, including AD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models and biomarker-guided clinical trials.77

We acknowledge limitations in our current study. First, the patient data include only commercially-insured individuals and US Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. At present, over 26 million out of 62.7 million (i.e., 42%) of US Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. The Medicare Advantage enrollees represent a geographically and racially diverse American older adult population. Thus, our study results can be generalized to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. However, the results may not be generalizable to traditional Medicare beneficiaries, as most Medicare Advantage enrollees have access to additional benefits that are not covered by traditional Medicare. Second, socioeconomic status (SES) and education level are not included in this study because administrative claims data are primarily designed for reimbursement purposes. Results from neurological exams, cognitive tests, genotypes (APOE), and brain imaging studies are also not included in this study. In addition, we were unable to observe blood pressure records due to the constraints of administrative claim data. We used both nearest neighbor and propensity score-matching approaches to adjust various comorbidities (including diabetes and renal disease, Table S5 in supporting information) in both AA and EA populations based on our sizeable efforts, possible unknown confounding factors may exist as well. Third, dosage information in insurance claim captures may not reflect actual medication usage, even though these data are widely used to investigate drug adherence.78 Fourth, the effect size of MR analyses was influenced by the small sample size of AA individuals used in AD genetic studies. MR analyses should therefore be investigated further with a larger AA population in the future, such as the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP).4 In addition, considering the sample size of eQTL dataset,40 which was a nearly 1000-fold smaller than HTN and T2D GWAS datasets, the F-statistic value 9.64 is acceptable44 for validity. Fifth, although we conducted both population-based observational and MR analyses, we cannot establish causality of telmisartan exposure with intervention effect on AD and dementia. Several ongoing interventional clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02085265 and NCT02471833) are currently investigating the neuroprotective effects of telmisartan, including in the AA population. Thus, the results reported here offer population-based and genetic evidence to support randomized controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02471833) with an ethnically diverse population, in order to test the clinical benefits of telmisartan on AD, in particular for AA people. Lastly, we emphasize that joint modeling of dosing frequency and dosage strength is an important future direction for the development of statistical methodology.

Highlights

Telmisartan is associated with lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in African Americans (AAs).

Telmisartan is the only angiotensin II receptor blockers having PPAR-γ agonistic properties with beneficial anti-diabetic and renal function effects, which mitigate AD risk in AAs.

Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis demonstrates the specificity of telmisartan’s protective mechanism to AAs.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review:

The authors reviewed the literatures using traditional sources. Telmisartan has been reported to protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia. Telmisartan is under investigation as a candidate treatment of AD in two clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02085265 and NCT02471833); yet, whether telmisartan has race-specific beneficial effects in AD has not previously been investigated using real-world patient and genetic data.

2. Interpretation:

Telmisartan is the only angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) having PPAR-γ agonistic properties with beneficial anti-diabetic and renal function effects, which could mitigate AD risk in African Americans (AAs). Our comprehensive population studies identify a significant association of telmisartan with reduced risk of developing AD in the AA population but not in non-Hispanic European American (EA) population. Further Mendelian randomization (MR) genetic analysis supports the beneficial effects of telmisartan for AD in the AA population.

3. Future directions:

A large randomized controlled trial with an ethnically diverse population is warranted to further validate the specific clinical benefit of telmisartan in prevention and treatment of AD in the AA individuals.
