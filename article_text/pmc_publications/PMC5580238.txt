[18F]THK-523 and [18F]807 are promising radioligands for imaging neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) with positron emission tomography (PET) in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury. Although [18F]THK-523 and [18F]T807 are considered high-affinity selective radioligands for NFTs, uncertainty has existed as to whether PET radioligands for imaging NFTs bind to the same molecular site because in vitro assays for ligands binding to NFTs have been lacking. We labeled THK-523 and T807 with tritium to serve as reference radioligands for in vitro binding assays with AD brain homogenates for newly synthesized ligands. With these radioligands, we identified two distinct binding sites for small molecules, one site with high affinity for THK-523 and the other with high affinity for T807. Moreover, binding assays with [3H]PIB confirmed that the two newly identified binding sites are also distinct from the thioflavin-T binding site where all current clinically useful PET radioligands for imaging β-amyloid plaque bind with high affinity. The two newly identified binding sites are considered to reside on NFTs rather than on β-amyloid plaques. Furthermore, we applied all three binding assays to a set of newly prepared compounds, based on chain modifications to THK-523. Some compounds with high affinity and selectivity for the THK-523 binding site emerged from this set, including one with amenability to labeling with fluorine-18, namely, ligand 10b.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies constitute an increasingly enormous societal burden in terms of mortality, morbidity and cost, amidst a continuing absence of effective treatment strategies. Brain neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques are two pathological hallmarks of AD.1 NFTs are generated from abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein, whereas neuritic plaques are comprised primarily of β-amyloid. Human postmortem studies indicate that NFT deposition, unlike β-amyloid plaque deposition, correlates well with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.2–7 Furthermore, abundant NFTs are not observed in individuals who are cognitively unimpaired,5 in contrast to β-amyloid plaques which are nonetheless observed in some nondemented people.8–11 Moreover, tau and phospho-tau (ptau181) residing in cerebrospinal fluid are known to be useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD.12–15

NFTs are also characteristic of many other tauopathies besides AD, such as sporadic corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick’s disease, frontotemporal dementia Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, and Guamanian Parkinsonism dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex.16 Tau aggregates are also the pathological hallmark of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disorder that occurs as a consequence of traumatic brain injury.17 Aggregation of tau also arises from numerous forms of neuronal injury, including hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and heat shock.

Positron emission tomography (PET) may detect and quantify a low-density protein in living human brain when this imaging technique is used with an effective radioligand that penetrates brain to provide a robust and adequately high specific signal. Such radioligands are invariably labeled with either of two cyclotron-produced short-lived positron-emitters, namely, carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 109.8 min). Over the past decade and a half, significant progress has been made on developing radioligands for PET imaging of β-amyloid plaques in diseased human brain (Chart 1). The radioligand from Eli Lilly, Amyvid (Florbetapir; [18F]AV-45),18,19 is the first approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use. GE’s Vizamyl (Flutemetamol; [18F]3′-F-PIB; GE-067)20 is also now approved by the FDA. NeuraCeq (Florbetaben; [18F]AV-1; [18F]BAY94-9172)21 and [18F]AZD469422 are also proving clinically useful. Each of these radioligands, and also the progenitor radioligand [11C]PIB,23 binds with high affinity to the so-called “thioflavin-T binding site” on β-amyloid plaques.

By contrast with the PET imaging of β-amyloid plaques, the PET imaging of NFTs is much less advanced, mainly because candidate PET radioligands are still limited in efficacy.24,25 A high-performing PET radioligand for imaging brain NFTs would be useful not only to identify areas of neuronal damage but also to monitor the effectiveness of experimental therapies in AD, CTE, and other tauopathies. Indeed, several drugs that block phosphorylation and/or aggregation of tau are being developed for the possible treatment of these diseases.

Recent publications on [11C]PBB3,26 [18F]T807 (AV-1451),27 [18F]T808,28 and [18F]THK-52325 (Chart 2) suggest that these radioligands have at least moderate selectivity for binding to NFTs over β-amyloid plaques, primarily on the basis of evidence gleaned from in vitro autoradiography of postmortem human brain. [11C]PBB3,26 [18F]T807,27 and [18F]T80828 have also shown moderate NFT-specific signals in PET imaging of human subjects. However, [11C]PBB3 suffers from photoisomerization, which poses difficulties for regular practical application. Based on the initial report,25 [18F]THK-523 gives a low PET signal and may suffer some other undesirable properties, such as low brain entry and radiodefluorination. However, radioligands that are structurally related to [18F]THK-523, namely, [18F]THK-511729 and [18F]THK-535130 (Chart 2), have recently entered clinical trials. Therefore, we also selected THK-523 as a lead compound in our search for more promising PET radioligands for imaging NFTs.

Multiple binding sites for PET radioligands that target β-amyloid plaques have been identified.31,32 This suggested to us that more than one ligand binding site might also exist in NFTs. Therefore, we produced both [3H]T807 and [3H]THK-523 to serve as reference radioligands for our in vitro assays on new candidate ligands for NFTs. As a result, we discovered that the binding sites for these two radioligands are distinct from each other, and that they are also distinct from the β-amyloid plaque binding site for thioflavins, such as [3H/11C]PIB. In addition, a limited medicinal chemistry effort, based on chain extension and modification of THK-523, provided ligands with moderate lipophilicity and with high affinity and selectivity for the identified THK-523 binding site, including 10b which is amenable to labeling with fluorine-18.

RESULTS

Chemistry

Ligand Synthesis

Specifically, we wished to explore whether the affinity of THK-523 for binding to NFTs could be enhanced by extension of its pendant 6-(2-fluoroethoxy) group and by structural variation at its terminus. The use of oxyethylene units to extend chains has been implemented previously as a promising strategy in PET radioligand development for imaging β-amyloid plaques, as apparent in the structures of Florbetapir19 and Florbetaben21 (Chart 1). Especially, this strategy allows radioligand lipophilicity to be kept within a desirably moderate range and can also be used to retain a terminal site for labeling with fluorine-18. We further considered that variation in the terminal substituent of the pendant chain, especially with a bulkier group having hydrogen bond acceptors or donors, might enhance binding affinity with NFTs through extra binding interactions. Therefore, we devised a general strategy to prepare THK-523 derivatives featuring chains composed of a defined number of oxyethylene units (1–6) and with a fluoro, hydroxy, or larger substituent as a chain terminus. Our synthetic strategy was based on commercially available 2-chloro-6-methoxyquinoline (1) as starting material.

The first stage in the overall synthesis program was to replace the methoxy group in 1 with one or more oxyethylene units (Scheme 1). The phenol 2 was obtained in moderate yield (47%) by demethylation of 1 with boron tribromide. Various poly(oxyethylene)-bis-alcohols were monotosylated to give 3b–f in low to moderate yields (29–53%). Treatment of 2 with the bromo compound 3a or with one of the tosylates gave the hydroxyl terminated compounds with the desired number of oxyethylene units (4a–f) in good to excellent yields, except for 4a (27%). This approach was also explored for preparing analogous compounds with a fluoro terminus, but succeeded only for compound 5 having a pendant 6-(2-fluoroethoxy) chain. Nonetheless, 5 was obtained in virtually quantitative yield (Scheme 1).

The next stage aimed to cross couple the prepared chloroquinolines (4a–f and 5) with 4-(Boc-amino)-phenylboronic acid through Suzuki reactions. The preparation of the methoxy compound 6 from 1 (Scheme 2) was used as a model for establishing effective coupling conditions. We tried various combinations of phosphine ligand, palladium compound, and solvent, including 2′-phenyl-phenyl di-t-butyl phosphine plus Pd(OAc)2 in THF or DMF, 1,1′-bis-(diisopropylphosphino)ferrocene plus Pd2(dba)3 in toluene, and Pd(PPh3)4 plus K2CO3 in DME-H2O. The latter combination was most effective, giving virtually quantitative yield of 6. K2CO3 was necessary for the reaction to proceed, and the proportion of water had to be kept below 50%. These coupling conditions delivered the N-protected hydroxy-terminated compounds (7a–f) plus the N-protected fluoro compound 8 in good to excellent yields (60–99%). Compounds 7a–f were readily converted into their tosylates (9a–f) in excellent yields (83–90%) by treatment with tosyl chloride. Our prior attempts to insert the tosylate group into these compounds before Suzuki coupling did not succeed. Treatment of 8 with TFA gave THK-523 (10a) in quantitative yield (Scheme 2).

Treatment of the N-protected tosylates 9b–f with TBAF in THF gave the target fluoro ligands 10b–f in moderate to high yield (40–92%), without the need for a separate deprotection reaction (Scheme 3). The small amount of water in the commercial reagent was found to be critical for the success of these syntheses. If water was rigorously excluded from the reactions, products were obtained with a lower number of oxyethylene units.

Treatment of the Boc-protected tosylate 9b with cyclohexane-1,3-dione, cyclopentane-1,3-dione or 2-aminoethanol in acetonitrile with potassium carbonate as base gave the variously chain-terminated compounds 11a (79%), 11b (59%) and 11f (21%), respectively (Scheme 3). Treatment of 9b with base plus one of the ketones, oxazolidin-2-one, imidazolidin-2-one or thiazoline-2-one gave the compounds 11c–e with alternative bulky terminal groups in a similar range of yields (21–59%). The Boc group in each of the compounds 11a–f was removed readily with BF3·OEt2 to give the target ligands 12a–f in 35–72% yields (Scheme 3).

Synthesis of Halo Precursors for Tritiation

Treatment of THK-523 (10a) with NIS in chloroform–methanol at room temperature gave compound 13 with an iodo group at each position ortho to the free amino group (Scheme 4). Any protective group at the amino group, such as an acetyl or formyl group, prevented iodination. We found that the two iodo substituents in 13 could be removed with hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C as catalyst to regenerate THK-523. Thus, [3H]THK-523 was obtained by treating 13 with tritium gas as a custom synthesis (Moravek Biochemicals &amp; Radiochemicals, Inc.) (Scheme 4).

Attempt at an analogous iodination of T807 did not generate any tractable compound, and no further effort was made to synthesize an iodinated derivative of T807. Bromination of T807 with NBS generated the tribromo substituted derivative 14 (Scheme 5). We found that the three bromo substituents in 14 could be removed with hydrogen in the presence of Pd/C as catalyst to regenerate T807. Thus, [3H]T807 was obtained by treating 14 with tritium gas as a custom synthesis (Moravek Biochemicals &amp; Radiochemicals, Inc.) (Scheme 5).

18F-Labeling of THK-523 and Derivatives

Because [18F] 10b–f might be considered candidate PET radioligands, we were interested to test the feasibility of their labeling with no-carrier-added (NCA) cyclotron-produced [18F] fluoride ion. The N-Boc-protected tosylates, 9b–f, were used as precursors for trial 18F-labeling (Scheme 6). After successful substitution of the tosylate group with [18F]fluoride ion, the Boc group was removed under acidic conditions. The labeled THK-523 derivatives [18F]10b–f were each neutralized and isolated with HPLC in 20–30% decay-corrected radiochemical yields.

Binding Assays for Human AD β-Amyloid Plaques and NFTs

We used three tritium-labeled compounds as reference radioligands (Chart 3) to measure the in vitro inhibition constants of new compounds with human AD brain homogenate as protein source. Protocols similar to those that have been used previously for assays of [3H]PIB binding to AD brain tissue did not generate any discernible inhibition curves for [3H]THK523 or [3H]T807 binding. We tried a variety of ways to improve the binding assays, including use of a variety of assay mediums, such as PBS, aq. DMSO (20%), aq. DMSO (40%), neat DMSO, aq. ethanol (20%), aq. ethanol (40%), neat ethanol, aq. BSA (0.1%), or Tween-20 (0.1%) in PBS, and a variety of washing solutions, such as PBS, Tris, aq. ethanol (20%), aq. ethanol (40%), or neat ethanol. The combination of conditions that gave reproducible results was as follows: (a) use of AD brain tissue homogenate that was rehomogenized after thawing the stock homogenate; (b) treatment of the rehomogenized suspension with a high-power ultrasonic probe; and (c) use of Tween-20 (0.1%) in PBS instead of PBS as the assay medium. After the best conditions were implemented, the washing solution was found to have little effect on measured Ki values (Figure 1).

Titration of AD Brain Homogenate with [3H]THK-523

The binding of the AD brain homogenate with [3H]THK-523 at different concentrations of THK-523 followed a typical saturation curve for a radioligand with a large proportion of nonspecific binding (Figure 2). The curve was fitted to the equation [BF]=Bmax[F]/(KD+[F])+(NS[F])+c

where [BF] is the concentration of bound radioligand, Bmax is the concentration of maximal binding sites, [F] is the concentration of free radioligand plus THK-523, KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant, NS is the coefficient of nonspecific binding, and c is the concentration of bound radioligand in background. The best fit was obtained with KD = 3.5 ± 3.4 nM, Bmax = 1576 ± 499 dpm, NS = 321 ± 7, and c = 17.38 ± 173.

Titration of AD Brain Homogenate with [18F]THK-523

The binding of the AD brain homogenate with [18F]THK-523 at different concentrations of THK-523 also followed a typical saturation curve for a radioligand with a large proportion of nonspecific binding (Figure 3). The curve was fitted as in the analogous experiment with [3H]THK-523. The best fit was obtained with KD = 4.6 ± 1.8 nM, Bmax = 1639 ± 235 dpm, NS = 169 ± 3, and c = 57.7 ± 65.2.

Inhibition of Binding to Human AD β-Amyloid Plaques and NFTs

When we used the three binding assays with AD brain homogenates to screen compounds for inhibition of radioligand binding at 1 μmol concentration, we found that the reference radioligands occupied distinctly different binding sites. Thus, T807 failed to inhibit [3H]THK-523 binding (Figure 4), and THK-523 failed to inhibit [3H]T807 binding (Figure 5). Similar mutually exclusive inhibition behavior was also observed for [3H]PIB (data not shown). These graphical demonstrations of multiple binding sites were also confirmed by the Ki values measured for THK-523, T807 and the newly synthesized compounds at the three different binding sites (Table 1). For the new fluoro compounds 10b–f, only the compound with two oxyethylene units (10b) showed high affinity (Ki = 28 nM) and selectivity for binding to the “THK binding site”. None of these compounds showed high affinity for the “T807 binding site”, whereas compound 12e, which has five oxyethylene units, showed high affinity (Ki = 43 nM) and selectivity for binding to the “PIB binding site”. Some variations in the terminal group were quite well tolerated among other compounds having two oxyethylene units. Thus, whereas compound 12a and 12b showed greatly decreased Ki values, compounds 12c–f retained both high affinity and selectivity for the THK binding site. Notably, 12e and 12f showed higher affinities (lower Ki values) than THK-523 itself in the same assay.

Computed Lipophilicity

Computation indicated that clogD for all the prepared target ligands was held within a moderate range (1.3–3.74), except for compounds 12a and 12f.

DISCUSSION

We overcame many obstacles to establish in vitro assays for measuring the relative binding affinities of small molecules for NFTs. The challenges that we met came from three main issues: (1) Ligand solubility is low in PBS; for example, THK-523 is insoluble in water or PBS; even its high fluorescence is not observed in water, reflecting its limited solubility in common media used for binding assays. (2) NFTs from AD brain homogenate are poorly accessible to small molecules; they exist as aggregates within neurons, unlike β-amyloid plaques, which exist outside neurons. (3) NFTs are highly heterogeneous, and on standing they precipitate within 5–10 min.

Effective conditions for binding assays on human AD brain tissue were achieved by taking three measures: (1) substituting PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS as the assay medium; (2) rehomogenizing the brain tissue homogenate before each experiment; and (3) ultrasound treatment of the tissue after the rehomogenization. With regard to the ligand solubility issue, we tried adding organic solvent, such as ethanol or DMSO, at various concentrations, to the binding assay medium. We also tried adding BSA. However, we did not obtain an appreciable signal for specific binding of radioligand, and the small dubious signal was also irreproducible. Although a low concentration of Tween-20 (0.001%) in PBS was ineffective, it was found that a much higher concentration 0.1% promoted complete dissolution of the ligands in aqueous media. The other two measures were designed to address the issue of poor NFT accessibility to small molecules. Rehomogenization before an assay experiment helped to break down the chunk of brain tissue into smaller pieces, thereby exposing individual neurons to the highest degree. Subsequent ultrasound treatment then helped to break the neuronal cell membranes, exposing the NFTs to small molecules.

During our initial efforts to work up assay conditions, we hypothesized that the specific radioligand binding signal was obscured by high nonspecific binding to the brain tissue homogenate. Therefore, various washing agents were tested to reduce radioligand nonspecific binding, such as PBS or Tris-buffer, or various concentrations of ethanol, DMSO, acetic acid, or formic acid in water. However, it was found that, after deploying the revised combination of conditions for the binding assay, the nature of the washing agent no longer affected the Ki measurement (Figure 2).

The KD value for THK-523 for binding to AD brain homogenate was also measured by titration. KD was found to be 3.5 ± 3.4 and 4.6 ± 1.8 nM with [3H]THK-523 (Figure 3) and [18F]THK-523 (Figure 4) as radioligands, respectively. These measurements are clearly in good agreement. However, the Ki value measured from the competitive inhibition experiment was much lower at 51 ± 22 nM. This discrepancy may derive from error that is intrinsic to the titration experiments, where the specific binding signals are only a small fraction of the total binding.

The principal discovery of this study is the plurality of distinct binding sites on NFTs. Both [18F]THK-523 and [18F]T807, and their close analogues, are considered to be radioligands that bind selectively to NFTs, based on ample evidence from autoradiography, immunohistochemistry, and the use of brain tissue from different disease origins.25,28,33,34 Therefore, in this study, we assumed that the binding of THK-523 analogues to AD tissue homogenate was entirely to binding sites on NFTs, rather than to other binding sites on β-amyloid plaques or to other proteins in AD brain homogenate. When we analyzed the binding data, we assumed a single-site model, to which the data fit quite well. No compelling reason to fit the data to two or more binding sites was found. The mutually exclusive binding behaviors of [3H]THK-523, [3H]T807 and of some of the prepared ligands (e.g., 10b, 12c, 12e; Table 1) showed that they occupy different binding sites within NFTs. Although multiple binding sites have been observed on β-amyloid plaques,31,32,35 only radioligands that bind to the thioflavin T site (Chart 1) have so far become useful for clinical PET imaging. Nonetheless, for biomedical research on the various NFTs in tauopathies, radioligands that bind to different sites on NFTs may well find distinct applications.

From only a small set of synthesized THK-523 derivatives, three compounds (10b, 12e, and 12f) emerged with high affinity (&lt;50 nM) and selectivity for the THK-523 binding site (Table 1). These contained two oxyethylene units. Some five-membered rings were well tolerated as chain terminal groups, as in 12c and 12e. Compounds with more than two oxyethylene units showed no appreciable binding at the THK-523 site (Ki &gt; 1000 nM), although 10e with five oxyethylene units showed high affinity and selectivity for binding to the PIB site (Ki&gt; 4.3 nM). Compound 10b appears of special interest because of (i) its demonstrated amenability to labeling with fluorine-18, (ii) high affinity (Ki = 28 nM) on par with that of THK-523 itself in the same assay (Ki = 51 nM), and (iii) a moderate lipophilicity (logD, 3.74) that computes to be only 0.44 clogD units greater than that of THK-523 (Table 1).

CONCLUSIONS

We developed reliable in vitro binding assays to measure the binding affinities of small molecules proposed as possible radioligands for PET imaging of NFTs. Through tritium-labeling of THK-523 and T807, we identified two different kinds of binding sites on NFTs. These two binding sites are also different from that of PIB. Use of these three assays expands the scope for developing new PET radioligands for NFTs by bringing a variety of binding sites into consideration. Moreover, chain modifications in THK-523 were successful in producing compounds with high affinity and selectivity for the THK binding site, accompanied by moderate lipophilicity compatible with further development as PET radioligands.

METHODS

Materials

Water was purified with a system comprising two filters, one Rio, one reservoir, and one Milli-Q synthesis system (Millipore; Bedford, MA). Common solvents were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Literature methods were used to prepare PIB,23 T807,36 2-fluoroethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate,37 and 2-hydroxyethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate.38 [3H]PIB was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA) as a custom radiosynthesis. 2-Chloro-6-methoxyquinoline (1) was obtained from Ark Pharma Inc. (Liberty-ville, IL). Other chemicals, including 2-bromoethan-1-ol (3a) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI), Fluka Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, WI), Acros (Hampton, NH), or Strem Chemicals (Newburyport, MA), and were used without further purification.

Instruments and General Methods

Analytical TLC was performed on precoated aluminum plates (silica gel 60, F254) and compounds were visualized under UV light at 254 or 365 nm. Reaction products were purified with flash column chromatography on silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh), and EtOAc-hexane-MeOH was used as mobile phase. Analytical HPLC was performed with a reversed phase column (X-bridge C18; 5 μm; 10.0 × 250 mm; Waters Corp.; Milford, MA) eluted with c. NH3 (0.025%) in MeCN-H2O at 6.2 mL/min. The chromatography system was fitted with a continuous wavelength UV-vis detector (System Gold 168 Detector; Beckman; Fullerton, CA) and an autosampler (System Gold 508; Beckman). For semi-preparative HPLC, a reversed phase column (Atlantis C18; 5 μm; 30 × 150 mm; Waters Corp.) or silica gel column (10 μm; 30 × 250 mm; Phenomenex; Torrance, CA) was eluted at 30 mL/min. The HPLC system was fitted with a manual injector (5 mL loop) and a third delivery pump using MeCN or EtOAc as mobile phase at 1 mL/min. The purities of compounds were determined with HPLC monitored for absorbance at 254 nm and expressed as area percentage of all peaks. All compound purities exceeded 95%.

The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of all compounds were acquired on a DRX 400 instrument (400 MHz 1H and 100 MHz 13C; Bruker; Billerica, MA), using the chemical shifts of residual deuterated solvent as the internal standard; chemical shift (5) data for the proton and carbon resonances are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield relative to the signal for TMS (δ = 0). Mass spectra were acquired using a Velos Pro LC-MS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) fitted with a Luna C18 column (5 μm; 2.0 × 150 mm; Phenomenex) eluted at 150 μL/min with a MeOH-H2O mixture. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were acquired from the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Urbana, IL). Either electron spray ionization (ESI) or electron ionization (EI) was used. Melting points were measured with a Mel-Temp (Electrothermal; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or SMP-30 (Stuart; Staffordshire, UK) manual melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. cLogD was computed with Pallas for Windows software version 3.8 in default option (CompuDrug; Bal Harbor, FL). A Discover apparatus (CEM; Matthews, NC) was used for microwave synthesis.

Brain Tissue

Postmortem brain tissues from an autopsy-confirmed AD case and a healthy control were obtained from the Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC), NIH.

Ligand Syntheses

2-Chloroquinolin-6-ol (2)

2-Chloro-6-methoxyquinoline (1; 10 g; 52 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (200 mL), and BBr3 (12 mL; 126 mmol) was added through a large needle syringe. Some off-white precipitate formed quickly and accumulated during the reaction. The mixture was stirred at RT overnight, and then quenched slowly by adding MeOH until heat and gas generation stopped. The solution was basified by adding NaHCO3 until gas generation stopped. The mixture was then extracted with DCM (200 mL × 3). The collected organic phase was dried (MgSO4), and the solvent was removed to give 2 as a brown solid (4.8 g; 47%) that was pure enough for subsequent reactions: lH NMR (CD3OD) δ 8.11 (d, 1H, 3JHH = 8.6 Hz, ArH), 7.78 (d, 1H, 3JHH = 9.2 Hz, ArH), 7.38 (m, 2H, ArH), 7.15 (d, 4JHH = 2.6 Hz, 1H, ArH); m/z (ESI-MS): 180.3 (100%, [M + H]+), 182.2 (30%, [M + H]+), 190.1 (22%); HRMS (TOF+): calcd for C9H7ClNO [M + H]+, 180.0216; found, 180.0215. Error (ppm): −2.5.

2-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)ethyl 4-Methylbenzenesulfonate (3b)

2,2′-Oxybis(ethan-1-ol) (1.7 g, 16 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (10 mL). p-TsCl (1.0 g, 5.3 mmol) and pyridine (1.2 mL, 16 mmol) were added sequentially. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 days, and then partitioned between DCM (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The aq. phase was extracted twice with DCM (100 mL). The combined organic phase was dried (MgSO4), and the solvent was removed to leave a colorless oil, which was dissolved in DCM.

In Vitro Binding Assays

Human AD brain tissue was homogenized in assay medium (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) at 1:500 dilution in volume, and aliquots of this suspension (100 μL) were added to each of four tubes (total 48 in a rack). A solution of tritiated radioligand ([3H]THK-523, [3H]T807 or [3H]PIB); 10 Bq/μL) in assay medium (100 μL) was added to each tube. Nonradioactive ligand (THK-523, T807 or PIB) or test compound was dissolved in DMSO to give a 1 mM stock solution, which was further diluted with DMSO to give solutions ranging in concentration from 1 × 10−5 to 10−10 M. A volume of 10 μL of each solution was added to each tube. After assembly of the components listed above in each tube (made up to a total volume of 1.0 mL with assay medium), the tubes were vortexed and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After separation of tube contents with a cell harvester, the filter paper (GF/B; Whatman; pretreated with 0.5% polyethylenimine solution) was washed with PBS (3 mL × 3). The filters were placed in 7 mL plastic vials and then scintillation fluid (4 mL) added to each. Each vial was vortexed until the filter was floating. After overnight incubation, the scintillation vials were counted for radioactivity. The collected data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 4 version 4.03 (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA) with “One site competition” curve-fitting. Ki values were calculated according to the Cheng–Prusoff equation:39 Ki=IC50/(1+[L]/KD)

where [L] is the concentration (0.4 nM) and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the reference radioligand. KD was determined with “Scatchard analysis of homologous displacement” from multiple runs with self-displacement from AD brain tissue.

Preparation of [18F]THK-523 ([18F]10a) and [18F]10b–f

The general method is exemplified for the radiosynthesis of [18F]THK-523 ([18F]10a), as follows. No-carrier-added (NCA) [18F]fluoride ion was obtained from the 18O(p,n)18F reaction by the proton irradiation of 18O-enriched water (&gt;95 atom %)40 at the NIH Clinical Center. NCA [18F]fluoride ion (3.7–9.25 GBq in 0.25 mL of H218O) was added to kryptofix 2.2.2 (5 mg, 13.3 μmol) and K2CO3 (0.5 mg; 3.6 μmol) in MeCN–water (95:5; 0.1 mL), and dried azeotropically by four addition–evaporation cycles of MeCN (1 mL each cycle). Precursor 9a (2.0 mg) was loaded into a 1.5 mL closed vial. [18F]Fluoride ion-K+-kryptofix 2.2.2 in dry DMF (0.7 mL) was then added. The reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 15 min, and the solvent then removed by blowing nitrogen through the mixture at 120 °C for 5 min. A solution of c. HCl–ethylene glycol solution (0.5 mL; 1:9 v/v) was added, heated at 120 °C for 5 min, and then cooled to below 40 °C. The reaction was quenched with a solution (0.5 mL) of c. NH3 (33%)-water (1:4 v/v). The reaction mixture was loaded onto a HPLC column (X-Bridge C-18; 19 × 150 mm, 10 μm particle; Waters) eluted at 10.0 mL/min with a mixture of A (0.1 M ammonium formate) and B (MeCN), with B increased from 20 to 40% over 60 min. Eluate was monitored for absorbance at 350 nm and radioactivity (NaI(Tl) Flow Count detector; Bioscan). The radioactive fraction with the same retention time as the respective reference ligand was collected and diluted with water (∼100 mL). This solution was passed through a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters; Milford, MA), which was washed at least twice with water. The radioactive product was washed out of the cartridge with absolute ethanol (1.0 mL) into saline (0.9% w/v; 10 mL) plus Ethanol USP (0.9 mL) containing Polysorbate 80 (20 mg), and then sterile-filtered into a sterile and pyrogen-free dose vial.

The formulated radioligand was analyzed with HPLC on an X-bridge C18 column (10 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Waters) eluted with 40% acetonitrile in water at 1.75 mL/min over 15 min. Eluate was monitored for absorbance at 350 nm and for radioactivity.
