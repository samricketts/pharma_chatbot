Background

Intracranial Aneurysm (IA) is usually a late-onset disease, affecting 1-3% of the general population and leading to life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Genetic susceptibility has been implicated in IAs but the causative genes remain elusive.

Methods

We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a discovery cohort of 20 Chinese IA patients. Bioinformatics filters were exploited to search for candidate deleterious variants with rare and low allele frequency. We further examined the candidate variants in a multi-ethnic sample collection of 86 whole-exome sequenced unsolved familial IA cases from three previously published studies.

Results

We identified that the low-frequency variant c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp (rs2298808) of ARHGEF17 was significantly associated with IA in our Chinese discovery cohort (P =7.3×10−4; OR=7.34). It was subsequently replicated in Japanese familial IA patients (P=0.039; OR=4.00; 95% CI = 0.832-14.8) and was associated with IA in the large Chinese sample collection comprising 832 sporadic IA-affected and 599 control individuals (P=0.041; OR =1.51; 95% CI = 1.02-Inf). When combining the sequencing data of all familial IA patients from four different ethnicities (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, European American, and French-Canadian), we identified a significantly increased mutation burden for ARHGEF17 (21/106 versus 11/306; P = 8.1×10−7; OR=6.6; 95% CI = 2.9-15.8) in cases as compared to controls. In zebrafish, arhgef17 was highly expressed in the brain blood vessel. arhgef17 knockdown caused blood extravasation in the brain region. Endothelial lesions were identified exclusively on cerebral blood vessels in the arhgef17-deficient zebrafish.

Conclusions

Our results provide compelling evidence that ARHGEF17 is a risk gene for IA.

Introduction

Intracranial Aneurysms (IAs) are weakened areas in the cerebral vascular that lead to abnormal dilation or ballooning1. Unruptured IAs are usually asymptomatic unless they reach sufficient size to influence surrounding structures. They are often found either through screening high-risk patients or as purely incidental findings during brain imaging for other neurological symptoms. The danger posed by IAs is rupture, leading to life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)2. About 1%−3% of the general population has or will develop IAs3,4. And 0.5% to 1% of people with IAs may suffer from rupture annually5. Meta-analysis showed a wide range of SAH fatality varied from 8.3% to 66.7% that decreased 0.4% per year (95% CI = 0.5 to 1.2) coinciding with the introduction of improved management strategies of pre-symptomatic and symptomatic IAs6.

The formation and rupture of IAs are likely related to multiple risk factors including smoking, hypertension, heavy alcohol consumption7 and other vascular disease8. A small percentage of which are related to infections9 and trauma10. Many studies have shown that there are underlying genetic risk factors for a large fraction of IA and SAH cases. It is known that 7% to 20% of patients have a positive family history11. First-degree relatives of individuals with aneurysmal SAH have a 4- to 7-fold higher risk of being affected than the general population12.

The genetic studies on IAs have been carried out through genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and family studies. To date, several GWASs have examined sporadic IA cases and identified several candidate loci: 4q31.2313, 2q33.114,15, 8q11.23, and 9p21.314–16; 18q11.2, 13q13.1, 9p21.3, and 10q24.2316. Unfortunately, follow-up replication studies showed that these loci are unlikely to explain a large fraction of IAs17. In family studies, linkage analysis of single IA families or sibling pairs have mapped several candidate loci, but no IA-causing mutations has been identified. Recently, four studies18–21 applied whole-exome sequencing (WES) on multiple IA-affected families to analyze the effect of the rare variant on IAs, three IA candidate genes (ADAMTS15, RNF213, and THSD1) were identified. However, many IA cases involved in those four studies cannot be explained by the mutations of these genes18–21. Therefore, new genetic causality for IA needs to be elucidated to unravel the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying IAs pathophysiology.

One of the challenges common to GWASs and familial studies on IAs is the number of patients or families in each study. Firstly, unruptured IAs usually do not manifest any clinical phenotype and the ruptured IAs have high mortality. Accumulating a large sample size requires a long-term epidemiological screening program involving multiple hospitals or registries. Secondly, as a late-onset disease, some family members may have deceased or not manifested IA at the time, which poses challenges to ascertain a complete pedigree for segregation analyses. Finally, the incomplete penetrance needs to be taken into considerations in the analysis of IAs.

Because much of the genetic contribution to complex traits cannot be explained by GWASs that focus on the identification of common variants, we focused our attention on the identification of rare (MAF &lt; 0.5%) and low-frequency (0.5% ⩽ MAF &lt; 5%) variants and applied next-generation sequencing (NGS), which enables more complete assessments of low-frequency and rare genetic variants. It is plausible that analyses of rare and low-frequency variants could explain additional disease risk or trait variability22 (Figure 1A). There is also recent empirical evidence that low-frequency and rare variants are associated with complex diseases23–25.

It is possible that few genetic alleles with modest effect size and incomplete penetrance can segregate in familial fashion as well as increase the IA risk in the general population (Figure 1B). For example, previous studies on familial late-onset Alzheimer disease showed that a significant excess of rare coding variants in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 was noted in probands. These variants did not actually co-segregate with the disease and some of those rare variants were also identified in sporadic Alzheimer cases26,27, suggesting that those rare variants may serve to modulate the risk of disease both in a familial format and in a sporadic format. With this possibility in mind, to increase the potential genetic loads of IAs in our study samples, lower the burden of sample collection, and identify these risk alleles underlying both familial and sporadic IAs, we purposefully sampled both familial and sporadic IA cases and compared the alleles to the population controls (Figure 1B). This subject ascertaining strategy was also employed in a recent IA association study by Kurki et al., in which they sampled 760 cases from both familial and sporadic IAs (40% of familial IAs) from Finnish population28. They successfully replicated the 9p21.3 and 13q13.1 IA association signals and identified four novel loci: 2q23.3, 5q31.1, 6q24.2, and 7p22.128.

We leveraged recent foundational developments in human genetics, such as the latest in silico predictors, large genetic variant databases (1000 Genomes Project (1000G)29 and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)30), and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) information31 to prioritize the IA risk gene. We also incorporated unsolved IA cases (no known genetic risk factors identified) from previous studies18–21 as the replication datasets to replicate the candidate variants and to assess the variant burden of the candidate genes (Figure 1C).

Results

Genome sequencing identifies 30 candidate variants

Based on our conceptual design described in the Introduction and Figure 1, we developed a human-genetics analysis pipeline that includes three major stages: variant discovery, variant replication, and risk gene prioritization (Figure 2). In the discovery stage, we genome-sequenced IA patients and performed variant filtering to identify a list of candidate variants. In the variant replication stage, we performed a replication test on the candidate variants using the unsolved IA cases from the previous studies18,19,21 to examine if any of the candidate variants can explain additional IA cases. Finally, we integrated all the sequencing data of IA samples and tested the variant enrichment in the genes to prioritize the risk gene of IAs (Figure 2). To further use the genetic information from familial cases, we performed the segregation analysis and Identity-by Descent (IBD) analysis to examine the association of candidate variants with IAs in families. We also examined the low-frequency risk variant in additional sporadic IA cases (Figure 2).

In our discovery stage, we ascertained 20 Chinese IA samples (Figure S1A, B) and interrogated their genetic variants using whole-exome sequencing or whole-genome sequencing technologies. We focused on the genetic variants in the coding regions by subsetting the WGS to the exome regions that captured by WES (that is, Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon 50MB). Using our ensemble variant calling pipeline (Methods in Supplementary Materials and Figure S), we identified 115,912 SNVs and 6,033 Indels in total. On average, we found 42,115 SNVs and 3,267 Indels per exome and 97.51% of those SNVs and 83.92% of indels were in dbSNP141. The variant set had a mean transition-to-transversion (Ti/Tv) ratio of 2.56 for all SNVs per exome (Table S6).

We first kept variants in our cases with allele frequency ≤ 5% in the East Asian population of both the 1000G and ExAC databases (Figure 2). Then we performed a case-control analysis to further ensure the putative risk allele was significantly enriched in the cases and was potentially associated with IA. We aggregated the 20 familial and sporadic cases and chose 208 Han Chinese subjects in the 1000G as controls after verifying the congruence of population structure by principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure S4). We applied the two-sided Fisher’s exact test on each variant in cases and controls and kept variants (6,685 variants left) that were significantly enriched in cases with P-value &lt; 8×10−3 after multiple hypotheses correction using Benjamini–Hochberg procedure at FDR = 5% (Figure S5 and Methods).

Then we kept the variants annotated as loss-of-function (LoF) variants. For missense variants, we adapted widely used bioinformatics tools including GERP++32, CADD33, SIFT34, PolyPhen-235, LRT36, and MutationTaster37 to predict their functional effects38 (Figure S5 and Methods in Supplementary Materials). We found 117 variants passed these bioinformatics filters. Finally, we required that at least two IA-affected families share a candidate variant, and 30 variants remained as candidates after this filter (Figure S5). Three of them are LoF variants that occurred at essential splicing sites and 27 of them are damaging missense variants predicted by multiple in silico algorithms (Methods and Table S7).

Replicate candidate variants in additional familial cases

We next examined the 30 candidate variants in additional unsolved IA cases from previously published studies18,19,21. There are 86 unsolved familial IAs (24 families) with WES data available. We named the Japanese cohort as “Replication 1”, the European American cohort as “Replication 2”, and the French-Canadian cohort as “Replication 3” (Methods and Table S1).

For Replication 1, we included 37 IA cases from 11 families (Figure S2A; Methods). The control samples for Replication 1 were from two databases that were used in the original publication by Yan et al.19: 104 1000G Japanese samples and 1208 Japanese samples from JGVCD39 (Table S1; Methods). For Replication 2, we included exome sequencing data of 34 European Americans IA cases from seven families18 (Figure S2B). The control samples were 99 Northern Europeans from Utah (CEU) subjects from 1000G. The ethnicities of cases and controls were examined by PCA in Figure S6. For Replication 3, we included 15 French-Canadians IA cases (Figure S2C). We also applied the 99 CEU subjects from 1000G as controls for Replication 3 since the ethnicities of the patients were confirmed in the original publication by Zhou et al.21

We applied our variant calling and prioritization methods to these replication datasets (Methods). Among the 30 candidate variants identified in the initial Chinese patients, six of them were observed in replication cohorts as well: five (rs115753757 of ADAM15, rs2298808 of ARHGEF17, rs35217482 of AOX1, rs114777682 of AKAP13, and rs150645471 of ACSM5) were found in Replication 1, and one (rs2397084 of IL17F) were found both in the Replication 2 and Replication 3 (Figure 3A; Table S8). After comparing the allele count of the variants to the population controls using two-sided Fisher’s exact test, we ranked these six variants based on their p-values by an ascending order and plotted it against the p-values of 30 variants in the discovery cohort (Figure 3A). Two out of the six variants (rs115753757 of ADAM15 and rs2298808 of ARHGEF17) were top ranking with p-value &lt; 0.05 (Fisher’s exact test; Figure. 3A; Table S8), suggesting a suggestive association with IAs.

Gene-level variant enrichment analysis identified a significantly higher variant burden of ARHGEF17 in IA cases than in controls

To assess the variant burden of the six genes with variants rediscovered in replication, particularly ADAM15 and ARHGEF17 with nominal significance in additional replications, we performed a ‘gene-level variant enrichment test’, a simplified gene-based association test: if a gene is associated with IA, we expect to identify more distinct rare deleterious variants at gene-level in cases than in controls, which can help us evaluate association for multiple variants in a gene22 (Figure 2; Figure S7).

We combined all four datasets of IA patients (106 in total) and considered the entire gene as a testing unit. We used 103 Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB) subjects, 104 JPT subjects, and 99 CEU subjects from 1000G as control individuals (in total 306 control samples). We applied the same variant prioritization methods that we developed (Figure S8). For each gene, we categorized the damaging variants into three categories: exclusively identified in cases, exclusively identified in controls, and identified in both cases and controls (Figure 3B). We compared the number of distinct damaging variants that exclusively observed in cases to those exclusively observed in controls, and we found a higher number of distinct damaging variants of ARHGEF17 in cases than in controls. Four distinct ARHGEF17 rare deleterious variants were exclusively observed in IA-affected individuals, while only one was exclusively observed in the 1000G control individuals (Figure. 3B, Table 1). For the other five genes, we did not observe higher number of distinct damaging variants in cases than in controls (Figure. 3B; Table S9).

We next examined the frequency differences of these ARHGEF17 deleterious variants in cases and controls. We found that 21 of the 106 cases (21%) and 11 of the 306 1000G controls (3.6%) have the ARHGEF17 deleterious variants (P= 8.1 × 10−7 by two-sided Fisher’s exact test; OR=6.6; 95% CI =2.9 −15.8; Table 1). When we consider the family as a unit by pruning the related subjects, nine out of 36 families (25%) carried the deleterious mutations of ARHGEF17 (P=4.3×10−5 by two-sided Fisher’s exact test; OR=8.8; 95% CI = 3.5-Inf; Table 1 and Table S10).

We also examined the expression profile of the six genes across different human tissues using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data31. We found that ARHGEF17 is the only gene among the six that is highly expressed in blood vessels (Figure. 3C), which provided additional evidence that ARHGEF17 could be a candidate gene of IAs and plays a role in human blood vessels. Based on the ExAC database, ARHGEF17 is extremely intolerant to LoF variants (probability of being LoF intolerant (pLI) = 1.00), and ARHGEF17 is also intolerant to missense variants with Z-score equals 3.18.

Pedigree and IBD analyses on ARHGEF17 variants

We went back to the pedigrees for segregation analysis. We found that three out of the five ARHGEF17 variants (c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp, c.5168G&gt;A_p.Arg1723Gln and c.5327G&gt;A_p.Cys1776Tyr) were co-segregated with IAs in at least one of the pedigrees (Figure. 3D and Table 1). The variant c.3511G&gt;A_p.Ala1171Thr was a novel variant found in a Chinese sporadic IA patient. The variant c.5581C&gt;T_p.Arg1861Cys was found in two patients from a French-Canadian family (Figure. 3D and Table.1). We performed IBD analysis on the families with ARHGEF17 mutations. Among the four families (Discovery P1, Discovery P4, Replication1 P6, and Replication2: FamilyD) with ARHGEF17 mutations co-segregated with IA, three (Discovery P1, Replication1 P6, and Replication2: FamilyD) had shared IBD haplotype that cover ARHGEF17 gene region (Table S11).

Overall, in our Chinese cases, we found two ARHGEF17 mutations (c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp and c.3511G&gt;A_p.Ala1171Thr). We screened the two mutations in the IA-unaffected Chinese family members that were available to our study. The variant c.3511G&gt;A_p.Ala1171Thr was only found in IA-affected family members. We found that four unaffected individuals had the mutation c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp and three of them are younger than the IA-affected family members (Figure 3D and Figure S1A). While not manifesting IA, the clinical history records of those four individuals showed that three of them had cerebrovascular abnormalities, including cerebral infarctions, cerebral artery stenosis, and bilateral fetal posterior cerebral artery. Two of them also had hypertension (Table S12).

Association analysis in sporadic IAs provided additional evidence supporting that ARHGEF17 is a risk gene of IA

Since c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp (rs2298808) is a low-frequency variant in East Asians and is carried by IA-unaffected individuals as well, we further examined if it was enriched in sporadic IAs cases. We independently screened this variant in additional 832 unrelated Chinese SAH patients caused by IA-rupture and 599 unrelated Chinese individuals with no evidence of IAs or other malformations (Table S2).

We found the alternative allele of rs2298808 showed nominal enrichment in IA-affected individuals compared to control individuals (AF Cases = 3.73%; AF Controls = 2.50%; P=0.041 by one-sided Fisher’s exact test, OR=1.51; 95% CI = 1.02-Inf; Table S12). In addition, the homozygous rs2298808 were only observed in five patients with ruptured IAs (Table S13). They provided additional lines of evidence that ARHGEF17 is a risk gene of IAs.

Functional studies of ARHGEF17 function and its mutations

We performed additional functional analyses on ARHGEF17 using in silico methods. We first performed a literature search to examine if ARHGEF17 is biologically related to IAs. In addition, we also performed computational modeling of ARHGEF17 domains using structural homologies to examine effects of mutations on the domain structures.

In our literature search, we found that ARHGEF17 encodes a Dbl family Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), which plays an important role in activating the Rho family GTPases40–42. The proteins of Rho subfamily (RhoA, B, and C) promote the formation of actin stress fibers that are essential for cellular processes, including cell shape, polarity, migration, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions40,43,44. We also found that the depletion of ARHGEF17 leads to defective human umbilical vein endothelial cell junctions45, suggesting that it could play a role in maintaining the integrity of blood vessels.

The predicted domains of ARHGEF17 include the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain for Rho GTPase activation, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain for lipid interaction, and the β-propeller fold that may mediate protein-protein interaction46,47. The variants c.3511G&gt;A_p.Ala1171Thr and c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp map to the DH domain and the PH domain respectively. Two variants (c.5327G&gt;A_p.Cys1776Tyr and c.5581C&gt;T_p.Arg1861Cys) map to the β-propeller domain (Figure 4A). All five mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues (Figure 4B). The variant c.5168G&gt;A_p.Arg1723Gln is the first amino acid of the predicted β-propeller domain that connects to the linker sequence between two domains (Figure S11A).

Computational modeling of ARHGEF17 important domains using protein homology showed that four variants (c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp, c.5168G&gt;A_p.Arg1723Gln, c.5327G&gt;A_p.Cys1776Tyr, and c.C5581T_p.Arg1861Cys) are exposed on the surface of the protein domain, suggesting that these variants might alter the enzyme in its interactions with substrate or cofactors and/or in its structural stability. Thr at position 1171 can introduce a bulky side chain compared to the wild-type Ala and might result in clashes in the domain structure (Figure. S11A, B).

arhgef17-deficient zebrafishes display intracranial hemorrhage

We found that zebrafish Arhgef17 is 67% identical to the human ARHGEF17 with a high degree of conservation in the DH domain, PH domain and Beta-propeller48 (Figure S12). Whole-mount in situ hybridization displayed abundant expression of arhgef17 in the zebrafish head region, including the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain during development (Figure 5A-C). Using ARHGEF17 antibody, we detected that Arhgef17 is expressed in the brain blood vessels at 72 hpf (Figure 5D, 5DI, 5DI-I, and 5DI-II).

To validate the functional impact of ARHGEF17 in vivo, we developed a zebrafish model with arhgef17 deficiency (Methods). We designed two splice-blocking morpholinos, I1E2-MO and I9E10-MO to knockdown arhgef17 by skipping exon 2 (DH domain) and exon 10 (PH domain), respectively (Figure. S13A). RT-PCR analyses of embryos injected with I1E2-MO and I9E10-MO determined the knockdown efficiency (Figure S13B-D). arhgef17 transcripts skipping exon 2 or partial exon 2 were detected in embryos with microinjection of I1E2-MO (Figure S12B,E), confirmed by DNA sequencing (Figure S13F). Microinjection of I9E10-MO caused a frameshift, resulting in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of arhgef17, as the new electrophoretic band was absent, and the PCR product of unedited sequence was reduced (Figure S13C, D).

arhgef17-deficient embryos appeared to be morphologically indistinguishable from their wild-type (WT) siblings up to 42 hours-post-fertilization (hpf) (Figure. 5E,F). From 42 hpf to 80 hpf, embryos injected with I1E2-MO or I9E10-MO displayed intracranial hemorrhage in multiple areas in the zebrafish head region, including the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain, in comparison to control embryos (Figure 5E,F; Figure S14A,B). Whole-mount o-Dianisidine analyses for hemoglobin staining49 confirmed erythrocyte extravasation in arhgef17-deficient embryos (Figure 5G; Figure S14C,D), suggesting the presence of defects in vessel integrity or development. To identify endothelial lesions that cause intracranial hemorrhage, we employed double transgenic zebrafish Tg (kdrl:EGFP; gata1:DsRed), in which the endothelium and the erythroid are marked by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed), respectively (Figure 5H). We observed erythrocyte extravasation marked by DsRed in the midbrain and hindbrain region (Figure 5I; Figure 6A,B), as well as the forebrain (Figure. 5J and6B) in arhgef17-deficient embryos. These intracranial bleeding sites are adjacent to the prosencephalic artery (PrA) (Figure. 5J) and the hindbrain vascular network, comprising the basilar artery (BA), primordial hindbrain channels (PHBCs) and central arteries (CtAs)50 (Figure 5H). However, overall blood vessel morphology and development appeared to be normal (Figure 5G, H, I; 5A, B). Furthermore, confocal imaging analyses identified multiple endothelial lesions, localizing specifically to a CtA (Figure 6AI, AI-I), ACeV (Figure. 6BI, BI-I), mesencephalic vein (MsV) (Figure. 5BII, BII-I) and posterior cerebral vein (PCeV) (Figure 6BIII, BIII-I). When we co-injected wild-type human ARHGEF17 mRNA into zebrafish zygotes with arhgef17 morpholinos, we observed a statistically significant reduction of intracranial hemorrhages (Figure 6C). However, co-injection with rs2298808 variant human mRNA can only partially reduce hemorrhage phenotypes in arhgef17-deficiency embryos (Figure 6C). These results reveal that endothelial leakage in multiple cranial vessels causes erythrocyte extravasation in arhgef17 deficient embryos and ARHGEF17 is a risk gene of IAs.

Discussion

IA is usually a late-onset complex disease with both genetic and environmental risk factors17. Similar to other common complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer, and diabetes, it is also genetically heterogeneous, so a large proportion of the patients does not follow a canonical Mendelian inheritance pattern26,51,52. Many affected families may include both inherited and sporadic components of the disease. Meanwhile, the sporadic cases can include inherited components as well, likely due to the incomplete penetrance of genetic risk factors.

In this study, we pooled familial and sporadic IA cases together and performed a case-control analysis in candidate variants filtering. We think this method may help (1) increase the genetic loads in cases; (2) lose the burden of collecting large families with multiple family affected; (3) identify the risk factors underlying the general population.

Aggregation of the unsolved IA cases from previous studies provided us the opportunity to study the genetic risk factors in multi-ethnic familial IA samples. We found ARHGEF17 had a significantly high mutation burden in the IA cases compared to control individuals (21/106 vs. 11/306; P=7.4×10−12), suggesting that ARHGEF17 mutations may be IA risk factors in both Asian and European populations.

We found four IA unaffected individuals in familial samples had the ARHGEF17 damaging mutation (rs2298808, MAF = 3.24% in EAS from ExAC, Table S12), which is likely due to the incomplete penetrance of this variant. We also found that the four heterozygous carriers of rs2298808 from two families are IA negative and relatively younger. One family had two heterozygous IA patients and the mean diagnose age is 50, while the mean age of heterozygous carriers is 43 (Figure S1A; family P4). The other family contained one 58-year old heterozygous IA patient, while the mean age of the two heterozygous carriers is 53.5 (Figure S1A; family P6). Therefore, at this point we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that some of unaffected heterozygotes will develop IA when they grow older. We further examined rs2298808 in sporadic Chinese IA cases. We found that the alternative allele frequency of rs2298808 is 3.73% in 832 unrelated cases, while 2.50% in 599 controls. This difference achieved nominal statistical significance (P=0.041 one-sided Fisher’s exact test; OR=1.51, Table S12), suggesting that it is a genetic risk factor of IAs. More interestingly, we only observed the homozygous rs2298808 in IA-affected individuals but not in the control individuals, and all of them have ruptured IAs (Table S13). Our rescue experiments using rs2298808 variant mRNA and found that rs2298808 mRNA can only partially rescue the hemorrhage phenotype in Arhgef17-deficiency embryos, suggesting that s2298808 mutation cannot disrupt the ARHGEF17 function completely in zebrafish. Nevertheless, this result does not contrast our conclusion that ARHGEF17 variant (s2298808) is associated with human IA with incomplete penetrance.

ARHGEF17 encodes one of the Dbl family guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs) and many Dbl family GEFs have been shown as oncogenes. Similarly, ARHGEF17 was identified originally as a gene whose expression was upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor cell-induced angiogenesis53. This is for the first time that ARHGEF17 is implicated in a cerebrovascular disease. Recent studies on ARHGEF17 showed that (1) ARHGEF17 is localized to the actin cytoskeleton via sequences in the N-terminus and activates RhoA at the intercellular junctions46; (2) the depletion of ARHGEF17 leads to defective human umbilical vein endothelial cell junctions45. Importantly, it has been shown that the specific activation of RhoA at intercellular junctions is critical for proper endothelial junction formation and integrity54. Other known risk loci in IAs are also implicated in the endothelial cell function and integrity. The recent study identified THSD1, which plays an important role in the endothelial cell focal adhesion and attachment20; the other two IA candidate genes ADAMTS15 and RNF213 have antiangiogenic activity and might also be involved in endothelial cell-cell junction stabilization19,21. The loss of endothelial-specific expression of Sox17 promoted IAs in an elastase-treated mouse model55; the destruction of tight junctions may facilitate macrophage migration and cerebral aneurysm formation in rats56. Therefore, it is plausible that ARHGEF17 mutations disrupt the RhoA activation that consequently leads to the endothelial junction destabilization in blood vessels, conferring risks for an IA formation and rupture.

We performed functional studies in the zebrafish model and showed that arhgef17 is abundantly expressed in the head region of zebrafish, including brain blood vessels. We have followed the technical guidelines for morpholino use in zebrafish57,58, and showed injection of two splicing-blocking MOs at low dosages (~3 ng) causes intracranial hemorrhage without overall embryonic abnormalities. The morpholinos-based knockdown leads to the perturbation of DH domain or results in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Importantly, the intracranial hemorrhage could be rescued by co-injection of human wild-type Arhgef17 mRNA. Thus, the prominent phenotypes of intracranial hemorrhage are caused by arhgef17 deficiency rather than morpholino toxicities and/or off-target effects. Human mRNA with rs2298808 variant can partially rescue the hemorrhage phenotype in Arhgef17-deficient embryos, suggesting that rs2298808 variant cannot completely disrupt the ARHGEF17 function in zebrafish and could be a risk factor for IAs.

Figure 1. The rationale and experimental design of our study.

(A) For a late-onset complex disease, a suite of common variants will have modest effects on IAs and contribute in an interactive manner to confer susceptibility. Meanwhile, some rare or low-frequency variants will have larger effects on IAs and contribute individually and/or in combination to the risk of IAs. (B) Those rare or low-frequency alleles with larger effect sizes and/or low-penetrance can contribute to a late on-set disease like IA familial form and increase IA risk in general population. To increase the potential genetic load of IAs, we can aggregate the familial IAs and sporadic IAs to perform the variant association test to find the candidate variants. (C) We can integrate the sequencing data of unsolved IA cases from previous studies to replicate the candidate variants followed by collapsing the variants to gene level to perform gene-level variant enrichment test to prioritize the risk gene of IAs.

Figure 2. The flowchart of human genetics analyses.

We genome sequenced 20 Chinese IA cases. We performed an initial variant filtering analysis and discovered 30 candidate variants. This was followed by a replication of those 30 candidate variants using three independent cohorts including samples from Japanese (Replication 1), European American (Replication 2), and French-Canadian (Replication 3) cohorts. Finally, a gene-level variant burden test was performed on the genes with variant rediscovered in the replication samples. For the low-frequency damaging variant in the IA risk gene, we performed additional association study by comparing the variant count in 1031 unrelated Chinese sporadic IA cases to 599 Chinese controls.

The variants were ranked by P-values generated through two-sided Fisher’s exact test in discovery samples and replication samples, respectively. (B) The number of unique rare and deleterious variants of the six genes with variants also found in replication samples. We collapsed the variant onto gene level and count how many distinct variants found in cases and controls, or in both. The allele frequency of the variant in cases and controls were not considered in this plot. (C) The expression profile of the six genes in different tissues. The expression data were obtained from GTEx consortium. (D) Pedigrees of the affected patients with ARHGEF17 mutations (two partially carried families Discovery P6 and Replication1 P1 were shown in the Figure S2A and Figure S3A). The age at diagnosis of IA (d.) is shown in years, and “a.” indicates the age of the individual. The labels for the pedigrees in Replication1, Replication2, and Replication3 were the same with their labels previous publications as shown in Figure. S3. The unaffected samples were screened for the ARHGEF17 mutations (c.4394C&gt;A_p.Ala1465Asp and c.3511G&gt;A_p.Ala1171Thr) by Sanger Sequencing.
