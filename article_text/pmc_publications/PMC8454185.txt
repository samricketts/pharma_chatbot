Historically, the two most prominent proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research have been the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the microtubule assembly protein tau. In the classical model for the etiology of AD, amyloid-β (Aβ)—an APP derivative and hyperphosphorylated tau form aggregates in the brain that underlie the pathogenesis of the disease. However, the connection between Aβ and tau pathologies remains unclear. Several studies have provided evidence that the presence of Aβ can induce or enhance neurofibrillary tangle formation by tau. Others have reported a direct interaction between tau and short fragments of the APP transmembrane domain, C99. Structural studies of C99 show that these in vitro tau-binding fragments of C99 are buried in the lipid bilayer and are likely unavailable to bind tau in vivo. Given the importance of APP and tau in AD, we sought to characterize the potential interaction of the Aβ precursor, full length C99, and tau in vitro using NMR spectroscopy. We found that C99 and soluble tau interact only weakly and, most likely, non-specifically.

pmcIntroduction

Hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include the widespread deposition of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregates derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein tau [1, 2]. Aβ plaques and NFTs have dominated AD research since they are clinical biomarkers [3]. The amyloid hypothesis posits that the pathological cascade of events in AD is initiated by the abnormal aggregation of Aβ [1]. Aβ is generated by amyloidogenic proteolytic processing when APP is initially cleaved by β-secretase (BACE1) to generate the soluble ectodomain, sAPPβ, and 99-residue transmembrane C-terminal fragment, CTFβ, referred toas C99. Subsequent γ-secretase cleavage of C99 yields 38–43 amino acid Aβ peptides [4, 5] and the soluble APP intracellular domain fragment [5, 6]. The healthy functions of APP and its fragments are not well understood, partly due to heterogeneity in the exact processing pathways and functional overlap with associated APP-like proteins [7]. The tau protein stabilizes and promotes the assembly of axonal microtubules in healthy neurons [8] and has six isoforms ranging from 352–441 amino acids in length, each distinguished by either three or four microtubule binding domains [9]. All tau isoforms, when hyperphosphorylated, have been observed to form paired helical filaments, which comprise the characteristic NFTs in AD [10, 11].

There is merit in exploring the relationship between APP and tau given their coincident aberrant aggregates in AD. While there is evidence that Aβ and tau pathologies are connected, the definitive link between these two hallmarks of AD remains elusive. Broadly, detectable Aβ plaque precedes tau fibrillation during AD progression, and this has promoted the idea that the presence of Aβ aggregates in the extracellular space somehow induces or enhances NFT formation in the cytosol [12]. In support of this, intracellular tau aggregation has been shown to be enhanced by extracellular Aβ deposition in vivo and in mouse models [13–15]. Moreover, amyloid plaques have been shown to exhibit a prion-like seeding effect on paired helical filament (PHF) tau aggregates in an in vivo preclinical study [16]. Several studies have looked at colocalization of Aβ and other APP fragments with tau. Immunohistology analyses suggest that both monomeric and oligomeric Aβ interact with phosphorylated tau in extracellular Aβ plaques and intracellularly as AD progresses in AD-affected neurons [17]. However, some studies do not detect widespread intracellular Aβ-tau colocalization and instead observe colocalization at pre- and postsynaptic terminals [18] and synaptic compartments [19]. In the classical model for AD, extracellular Aβ forms toxic oligomers that go on to seed plaques and somehow then triggers intracellular tau fibrillization, a process that would appear to require the mediation of an extracellular to intracellular signaling pathway. A number of different membrane proteins or complexes have been considered as the transducers of this Aβ to tau pathway [20–23]. However, it is also possible there isdirect interaction between Aβ and tau that triggers intracellular tau fibrillization.

In this regard, it is interesting to consider that extracellular Aβ may be able to bind to APP or C99 in the plasma membrane [24–26], which is not surprising given that both C99 and Aβ (which share the Aβ sequence) form homooligomers. It is therefore conceivable that C99 (or possibly even full length APP) could serve not only as the precursor of Aβ, but also as a receptor for Aβ. Given that C99 has a mostly-disordered 45 residue C-terminal domain, there is much potential for C99 interaction with intracellular tau. One can speculate, for example, that tau might not bind to the well-documented homodimeric form of C99, but that binding of extracellular Aβ to dimeric C99 might drive C99 into a tau binding-competent monomeric form.

Direct interaction of C99 and tau was reported in 1995 by Smith, et al. [27] They found that tau bound to extracellular senile plaques in situ and that binding efficiency was independent of the tau phosphorylation state [27]. Several studies have previously mapped the binding of tau to APP residues 713–724 [27–29] which are in the cytosolic half of the transmembrane of APP and its derived C99 fragment [30]. Residues 713–724 span a segment that is proteolytically processed by gamma secretase during Aβ generation and a peptide representing residues 713–724 is not known to exist outside of the lipid bilayer [31–33]. Based on this work, the proposed APP-tau interface in vivo is thought to only be present in the cytosolic-proximal half of transmembrane fragments of APP or C99. A follow-up study confirmed binding between full length APP and water-soluble tau via crosslinking [34] in vitro but identified residues 390–412 in the APP ectodomain as responsible for tau binding.

To our knowledge the direct interaction of the full length C99 and tau has not been tested. It is reasonable to wonder how the water soluble tau could bind APP/C99 at transmembrane residues 713–724 since the binding site is buried within the lipid bilayer [28]. However, given the importance of AD, we sought to directly test whether tau and C99 bind each other. Titrations of C99 into tau and vice-versa were performed using purified recombinant proteins. In both cases the titrand was uniformly 15N-isotopically labeled so that individual amino acid chemical shifts could be tracked using 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC NMR spectroscopy. Our results do to not lend support to the notion that C99-residues 713–724 interact with tau. Moreover, the interaction between monomeric C99 in LMPG micelles and water-soluble tau was seen to be weak and non-specific.

Methods

Bacterial Expression of Full Length Tau1–441

The purification of recombinant tau employed in this work draws heavily upon previous methods [35]. pET-29b plasmid (Addgene) with the gene for tau (2N4R isoform, 441 residues) was transformed into a BL21 (DE3) E. coli vector and plated overnight on an LB/agar plate with kanamycin. A 60 mL LB starter culture grown overnight at 37 °C was used to inoculate 6 × 1L of M9 minimal media supplemented with kanamycin (30 ug/mL). The culture was grown at 37 °C on a shaker at 230 rpm. Expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) once cells reached OD600nm 0.6–1.0. Cells continued shaking post-induction for 3 hours at 37 °C before being harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min. Cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

The pellet was thawed and resuspended in 10 mL phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 2.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.2) per gram of wet cell mass supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (P8849, Sigma). The suspension was sonicated on ice for 10 minutes (5 on/5 off cycle) at 60% power. After sonication, the suspension was stirred at 80 °C for 15–20 minutes with a hot plate and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Precipitates were removed via centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.2 um syringe filter, then exchanged into cation exchange chromatography buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 2 mM EDTA) using an Amicon 30 kDa MW cutoff centrifuge filter (Millipore). Cation exchange chromatography was then conducted using an ATKA Start system with a HiTrap SP HP 5 mL column (Cytivia). Protein was eluted using a gradient of 0–80% Buffer B (50mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 2mM EDTA, 2M NaCl) over 4–6 column volumes (CV). Fractions were run on SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing pure tau were pooled together. Tau1–441 expression was confirmed via Western Blotting using anti-tau antibody (Cell Signaling #4019S).

Bacterial Expression of APP-C99

Expression and purification of C99 was carried out as previously described.pET-21b plasmid carrying His6-tagged C99 I109W (Tryptophan added to purification tag to aid UV-Vis detection) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli. 60 mL LB starter culture grown overnight at 37 °C was diluted into 6×1L of M9 minimal media with ampicillin (100ug/mL). The culture was grown at 37 °C with 230 rpm shaking. Expression was induced with the addition of 1 mM IPTG once cells reached OD600nm 0.6–1.0. Cells were harvested via centrifugation at 5000 × g for 30 min after overnight induction at 18 °C. Harvested cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Cell pellets were thawed to room temperature and resuspended in lysis buffer (75 mM Tris pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) before tumbling the suspension with lysozyme, DNAse, RNase mixture for 1–2 hours. The lysate was then sonicated on ice at 60% power for 10 minutes at 50% duty cycle, followed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 20 minutes at 4 °C. The inclusion body pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer with a Dounce homogenizer. The sonication/centrifugation/resuspension cycle was carried out twice more to remove contaminants from the inclusion body pellet. 3% Empigen was added to the final inclusion body resuspension and tumbled overnight at 4 °C to extract proteins.

The following morning, the insoluble fraction was removed via centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 minutes. The soluble fraction was tumbled for 45 minutes with 1–2 mL Ni-NTA resin that was pre-equilibrated in Tris‐buffered saline (TBS, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5 140 mM NaCl). After tumbling, the resin was loaded onto a gravity column and rinsed with 10 CV of 3% Empigen (BOC Sciences) in TBS. Impurities were removed and the protein was exchanged into lyso-myrisotoylphosphatidylglycerol (LMPG) detergent with two 10 CV washes of 0.5 wt% LMPG in TBS containing 10 mM and 30 mM imidazole pH 7.8, respectively. Finally, C99 was eluted with an elution buffer of either 0.1 wt % or 0.5 wt % LMPG, 250 mM imidazole pH 7.8 in TBS.

Preparation of Sample for NMR Spectroscopy

Eluted proteins were first swapped into NMR buffer consisting of 25 mM buffer (sodium acetate for pH 4.5, imidazole for pH 6.5), 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA plus a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of detergent (LMPG). Buffer swapping was performed using Amicon MW cutoff filters (Millipore, 10kDa for C99, 30kDa for tau). Final concentrations were determined via UV absorption at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 11,400 M−1cm−1 for C99 I109W and 7450 M−1cm−1 for tau1–441. Titrations of unlabeled (0 to 300 μM) tau into 50 μM U-15N-C99 were buffered with 25 mM imidazole, pH 6.5, 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% LMPG. Titration of unlabeled (0 to 200 μM) C99 into 50 μM U-15N-tau was buffered with 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% LMPG. All titration samples maintained the same concentration of LMPG in order to prevent detergent based artifacts.

NMR Spectroscopy

Proton 1D and 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra were acquired at 45 °C on a cryoprobe-equipped 800 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer. NMR data was processed with Topspin 3.2 and analyzed using NMRFAM-SPARKY. Chemical shift perturbations were measured according to equation 1. Eq. 1 CSPx(Δδ)=(δ[H10]−δ[H1x])2+(0.14(δ[N150]−δ[N15x]))2

where δ [1H0] and δ [15N0] are the chemical shifts for a given peak in the 1H,15N TROSY-HSQC spectrum prior to the start of the titration and δ [1HX] and δ [15NX] are the chemical shifts for that same peak at a given titration point.

Results

We started by titrating tau into U-15N-C99 in LMPG detergent micelles because the structure of C99 was previously determined in LMPG at pH 6.5 [36]. This previous work allowed for the transfer of C99 resonance assignments. In order to avoid detergent and buffer-based artifacts, both tau and C99 were buffer swapped into the same buffer. 1 % LMPG detergent did not unfold soluble tau, as indicated by preserved peak dispersion in the TROSY-HSQC proton dimension. Moreover, a ratio of 50 μM C99 and 1 % LMPG concentration does not force C99 oligomerization by maintaining a 1:8 ratio of C99 to LMPG micelle.

As shown in Figure 1, addition of 0–300 μM tau into 50 μM C99 solution was seen to induce small chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in 19 peaks, mostly from residues near the protein-micelle interface or in the unstructured soluble C-terminal loop. C99 CSPs were linear as a function of tau concentration are therefore reflect a KD of &gt;300μM, consistent with non-specific tau interaction with C99.

We also conducted the reverse titration of unlabeled C99 into U-15N-tau for completeness. The reverse titration was conducted at pH 4.5 because the TROSY spectrum of tau exhibited more peaks and increased spectra dispersion at this reduced pH relative to pH 6.5. Previous work showed a strong C99 fragment-tau interaction at pH 5.0 [27]. C99 is known to maintain its structure at pH 4.5 [37]. We observed large CSPs in many resonances as a function of C99 concentration however, as shown in Figure 2, the CSPs were again linear in nature, confirming only weak and likely non-specific binding between soluble tau and C99. Backbone assignments for tau1–441 have been reported previously in different buffer conditions [38], but the results did not warrant the significant effort that would be required to transfer assignments between conditions.

Discussion

Previous work suggested that tau binds to a short peptide derived from APP at a KD of 9.6 nM [27] with the binding interface on APP including residues located on the cytosolic end of its transmembrane segment (spanning residues 713–724) [27–29]. Interestingly, those studies did not try to map any binding interface to tau. [27–29] Those studies [27–29] used either Nonidet P-40 [28] or Tween-20 [27, 29] detergents at pH values ranging from 5 to 8; these non-ionic detergents are commonly used when studying protein-protein interactions but lack a phospholipid-like structure. It is unclear if these detergents are suitable when trying to determine binding of a transmembrane fragment to a large soluble protein. A more recent work found no binding between APP residues 713–724 and tau [34], however, these results should be regarded with caution since no detergent use was reported. All previous studies used short peptides to investigate APP-tau binding interfaces and did not validate the APP713–724 interfaces with full-length APP or C99. Moreover, those studies used either no detergent or non-ionic detergents that lack a phospholipid-like structure. We therefore decided to carry out quantitative NMR-monitored titrations of C99 and tau in a non-denaturing model membrane environment (LMPG micelles) to determine whether these two proteins associate under conditions that are more physiological than in the previous studies.

Titration of tau into C99 and the reverse titration led to results indicating only weak and likely non-specific binding between C99 and tau, as indicated by observation of only linear CSPs for a limited number of peaks in the spectrum of the 15N-labeled protein as a function of the concentration of the other (unlabeled) protein. Both titrations were conducted in the presence of 1 % LMPG in order to provide C99 with a membrane-mimetic environment without unfolding tau. We also carried out titrations at both acidic (pH 4.5) and neutral (pH 6.5) pH in order to try and recreate the pH range used in previous work [27–29]. It seems unlikely that another detergent or membrane model system would have yielded qualitatively different results. The lack of interaction reported here is in contrast to the KD of 9.6 nM [27] reported previously by Smith et al., where the tau-C99 binding assay was conducted under buffer conditions that lacked detergent such that the reported strong binding affinity was likely due to aggregation of the APP transmembrane peptide.

Our results suggest that tau and full length C99 have little affinity for each other, at least under the conditions of our study, which involved C99 in its monomeric form and both proteins in forms where they have not been post-translationally modified. We cannot yet exclude the possibilities that the affinity of tau for the dimeric form of C99 could be higher, or that post-translational modification of one or both proteins could increase their affinity. We also cannot rule out the possibility that there is a C99-mediated signaling pathway leading to tau, but that there are other proteins in the chain of response from C99 to tau.

In summary, we find that soluble Tau and full length C99 in model membranes do not bind each other with significant affinity at either pH 4.5 or pH 6.5. This is inconsistent with previous fragment peptide-based only results that indicated C99 residues 713–724 bind tau in Tween-20 and Nonidet P-40, detergents that lack phospholipid-like structure. Given that residues 713–724 of C99/APP will always be buried in the lipid bilayer under physiological conditions, the lack of interaction observed here is not surprising. While our results cannot rule the possibility that there may be conditions that we did not test in which these two proteins interact with high affinity, the unmodified and monomeric forms of these two proteins do not avidly interact under model membrane conditions.
