Introduction

Individual reactions to a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can vary in a wide range of both adaptive and maladaptive responses. Understanding such reactions to diagnosis is important to maximize adaptive responses that can promote continued independence.

Methods

In this pilot study, the Aging and Memory Quality of Life (AMQoL) survey was developed to facilitate an understanding of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors results from a diagnosis of MCI. The Aging and Memory Quality of Life was administered to 45 individuals diagnosed with MCI and 45 cognitively normal participants serving as control subjects matched for age, gender and education. Study partners were surveyed to collect corroborating and or discrepant observer responses.

Results

Inconsistent with study partners’ reporting, MCI subjects may be underreporting physical limitations, and over-reporting medication compliance. MCI subjects identified challenges to managing financial affairs.

Discussion

Developing strategies to circumvent development of maladaptive behaviors could significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in MCI patients.

1. Background

Worldwide, there are an estimated 46.8 million individuals living with cognitive impairment1. On the spectrum, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the functionally disabling stage of dementia2. MCI can be challenging to diagnose, but prevalence estimates range from 10% to over 20% of persons 65 and older3. Persons with MCI have been shown to have lower scores of quality of life4,5 than those that are cognitively normal. Individuals with MCI also experience more behavioral changes such as declines in social engagement4, changes in personality5, increased healthcare utilization and increased healthcare costs6, and changing family dynamics7,8.

It is not uncommon for persons with MCI to develop maladaptive behaviors and negative attitudes to their diagnosis to avoid confronting their disease. While adaptive behavior can maximize adjustment to situational changes such as a diagnosis of MCI, maladaptive behaviors can interfere with a person’s activities and quality of life, further contributing to the morbidity associated with the development of MCI. Maladaptive behavior can range from minor to severe. Ideally, a person diagnosed with MCI would engage in healthy, adaptive behaviors (e.g., engaging in physical activity or taking prescribed medication) as opposed maladaptive behaviors which could be minor such as not sharing the diagnosis with family or other healthcare professionals, to more severe, such as avoiding doctor’s appointments or refusing to acknowledge the diagnosis. Practopoietic theory suggests that while maladaptive behaviors are rooted at the biological level, they are modulated by social and ethical norms (good regulator theorem)9. For many, MCI diagnosis leads to experiences of emotional turmoil, a lack of clarity around their diagnosis and the future, and feeling little hope given the lack of available treatments10,11.

At this time, there is a lack of measures to examine the needs of persons diagnosed with MCI in regards to adaptive and maladaptive behaviors to inform healthcare and psychosocial providers on understand patient’s attitudes, behaviors and treatment needs. There is a need for tools that assess how a diagnosis of MCI affects varying biopsychosocial domains of an individual’s health and well-being. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine persons diagnosed with MCI’s adaptive and maladaptive behaviors and attitudes from a biopsychosocial perspective. Such assessment for persons diagnosed with MCI could assist healthcare professionals in providing appropriate interventions that facilitate engagement in adaptive behaviors.

2. Methods

The Aging and Memory Quality of Life (AMQoL) survey was employed as a tool for identifying the treatment needs of persons diagnosed with MCI.

2.1 Design

(Name omitted) Healthy Brain Aging Study is a longitudinal study of physical, neurological, and cognitive measures assessed annually. As part of this study, participants receive a medical, neurological, and neuropsychological examination12,13. The AMQoL was employed as a cross-sectional survey. Ethical approval was granted by the University’s Institutional Review Board.

2.2 Sample

Using a convenience sample, participants were identified as a subsample of (Name omitted) Healthy Brain Aging. Eligibility criteria involved being an individual who met criteria for MCI14 in the (Name omitted) Healthy Brain Aging or the study partner of an individual with MCI; study partner refers to an informant who researchers can contact to corroborate information. Specifically, persons diagnosed with MCI under the International Working Group on Mild Cognitive Impairment criteria of testing defined eligibility14. Study partner responses were used to compare the reports of attitudes, behaviors, and needs identified by individuals with MCI. Participants included 45 MCI subjects, 45 cognitively normal control participants (matched for age, gender and education) and both groups’ study partners. All subjects that were approached agreed to complete the brief survey. Sample size was dictated by the number of participants in the sample that were seen in the (name omitted) Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center’s clinic during a six month period.

2.3 Measures and tool

The Aging and Memory Quality of Life (AMQoL) survey was implemented to accomplish the aims of this study. The AMQoL was developed by clinic staff and a team of medical students, and was initially validated through interviews with 30 participants with MCI. The AMQoL questions are coded as positive (adaptive) versus negative (maladaptive behaviors). Four variations of the survey were utilized (MCI respondent, MCI informant, cognitively normal respondent, and cognitively normal informant). MCI respondents and their informants were asked to consider their questions since MCI diagnosis (“Since my/their diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment...”). Whereas cognitively normal respondents and their informants were asked to consider their responses in regard to their experience with aging (e.g., “I/They have noticed…. ….as I/they age.”).

Additional demographic and health characteristics were also collected on participants including age, gender, education (years), Charlson Comorbidity Index, Hachinski Ischemic Scale (likelihood of vascular involvement), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Cognitive assessment measures (Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, WMS Logical Memory immediate recall, WMS Logical Memory delayed recall, Digit span forward, Digit span backward, Category Fluency-animals, Trailmaking Test A, Trailmaking Test B, and WAIS Digit-Symbol) were also captured in addition to the AMQoL.

2.4 Data collection

Following invitation to elect to participate, data collection proceeded through an in-person interview of 39 close-ended questions, conducted by trained clinic interviewers, in the participant’s clinic examination room. The survey lasted 10–15 minutes for each participant.

2.5 Statistical Analysis

Responses were coded and entered in a Microsoft Access database and analyzed using Analyse-it 2.21 software. Survey items were compared on the basis of diagnosis and informant-subject differences in response. Demographic, clinical, and cognitive test measures were compared between highest and lowest quartiles. Given the categorical nature of the survey items, chi-square, Krukal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to describe the associations and comparisons within the data. With the Mann-Whitney u-test, the subject groups’ mean ranks and p-values (for statistical significance) are reported within the results section.

3. Results

3.1 Sample

Normal control included 45 participants, were primarily female (24 respondents; 53.3%), with 4.3% on medications for cognition. Of the 45 respondents in the MCI sample, they were primarily female (24 respondents; 53.3%), with 42.3% on medications for cognition. Information is summarized in Table 1. Subjects scoring high on the negative impact of aging or MCI were younger, healthier, and scored lower on category fluency, Trailmaking A&amp;B, and Wais digit-symbol tests (p-values 0.03, 0.003, 0.008, 0.001, 0.03, 0.04). In Table 2, cognitive assessment mean scores for both groups are reported.

3.2 MCI subjects

From the AMQoL survey responses, displayed in Table 3, MCI subjects underreported physical limitations, and over reported compliance with medical regimens when responses were compared to the reporting of their study partners (p&lt;0.001 &amp; p=0.008). MCI subjects reported less confidence in themselves, but were more interested in learning new things and reported being excited about the future compared to their cognitively normal counterparts (p-values 0.027, &lt;0.0001, and 0.016). MCI subjects were also less likely to consider a power of attorney (POA) important and less likely to have made such arrangements (p-values 0.002 &amp; 0.02), but were more likely to want and have received help managing financial affairs (p-values 0.008 &amp; 0.009) than their cognitively normal counterparts. 73.0% of MCI subjects stated that others take more responsibility for their own healthcare decisions. Listed in Table 4 is a comparison of MCI subjects’ test scores measure between the highest and lowest quartiles on the AMQoL survey. Results from the Trailmaking test A and B demonstrate those who did poorer on testing perceived less of an impact of diagnosis. Those who reported the most negative impact of diagnosis had better scores in the Trailmaking and category fluency tests and had fewer medical co-morbidities compared to those reporting the least negative impact of diagnosis.

3.3 Informants and MCI subjects’ variations

Informants and MCI participants differed in responses on some of the AMQoL items. Informants were more likely to report lower compliance with medical regimens and visiting their doctor (p=0.006 &amp; 0.02 respectively). Informants also reported greater changes in mood compared to the MCI subjects they were providing responses for (p=0.03). MCI subjects also reported that they felt less comfortable in social situations than was reported by their informants (p=0.02). MCI subjects were also less concerned about their POA than their informants (p=0.04).

4. Discussion

4.1 Biological and healthcare factors

MCI subjects reported increased physical limitations. Further, informants reported that MCI subjects under-reported on the severity of these limitations. It is possible this response is due to individual’s denial in reporting, or perhaps, the persons diagnosed with MCI feel they are doing okay physically as they are more focused on their cognitive decline. Further, results of the Trailmaking tests A and B demonstrate those who did poorer perceived less of an impact of diagnosis suggest those with less executive function may lack awareness into their illness15. As awareness can vary across domains of functioning with the onset (and then progression) of cognitive impairment, this would explain the incongruence and possible underreporting on changes in physical functioning, as well as other inconsistencies between persons diagnosed with MCI and their informants. Such considerations suggest the need for additional perspectives when persons diagnosed with MCI and other forms of cognitive impairment visit doctors’ offices, as an individual may not be able to self-report their current state of well-being. As such, when pursuing a diagnosis of MCI, it may be beneficial to have someone accompany the patient to the appointment or getting permission for the doctor to obtain information from an informant prior to the appointment.

In addition, nearly three-fourths of MCI respondents (73.0%) stated that others take more responsibility for their own healthcare decisions suggesting that MCI subjects might be losing some of their self-autonomy and feelings of control for self-management in their diagnosis. There is often an assumption that when one receives a diagnosis of cognitive impairment that there is an immediate need for others to assume control on behalf of the individual. However, many individuals with MCI still have capacity to manage much of their own affairs so such intervention can be problematic16.

4.2 Psychological and emotional factors

MCI subjects reported decline in mood and having less confidence in one’s self since the diagnosis of MCI. MCI subjects also reported being interested in learning new things and being excited for the future. Again, there was inconsistency between the informants’ responses and the persons diagnosed with MCI. Informants report that MCI subjects are less likely to be interested in learning new things than reported by the subjects themselves. Such a finding suggests that study partners may be missing opportunities to help their partner find situations where they can engage in learning new things.

4.3 Social, legal and economic factors

MCI subjects reported factors that negatively influenced them following diagnosis. For instance, MCI subjects reported feeling less comfortable in social situations, feeling like family members, friends, and healthcare professionals treat them differently following diagnosis and feeling as if others are overprotective of them. According to both sets of responses, there was an incongruence in study partner’s perception that those diagnosed with impairment felt uncomfortable in social situations, suggesting many diagnosed with MCI may be experiencing anxiety about their interactions with others in a need to hide their impairment, or perhaps they are beginning to have difficulty with conversation. Persons with MCI and dementia often discuss feeling the need to “perform” and hide their condition when in social settings among family, friends, and healthcare professionals17.

Further, the preliminary data suggests that earlier age of onset and gender are significantly associated with maladaptive behaviors, although maladaptive behaviors are seen across the demographic and clinical spectrum of persons with MCI. If younger males diagnosed with MCI are struggling to engage in adaptive behaviors, there may be a greater need to provide them more psychosocial support.

4.4 Limitations of study and future research

In future endeavors, the AMQoL will need to be validated in regards to its predictive utility in determining longitudinal outcomes following the diagnosis of MCI. Furthermore, the AMQoL should be tested with larger and more diverse samples, to confirm the present results. Despite these caveats, the present data suggest that the development of an intervention that might promote adaptive rather than maladaptive behaviors could be developed for those diagnosed with MCI.

In comparing those who were in the highest quartile/reporting the most negative impact of diagnosis and those in the lowest quartile/least negative impact of diagnosis, there were some findings that seemed counterintuitive. Those who reported the most negative impact of diagnosis had better scores in the Trailmaking and category fluency tests and had fewer medical co-morbidities compared to those reporting the least negative impact of diagnosis. Perhaps individuals with better overall health and cognition, are more cognizant of their cognition changes and find the addition of an MCI diagnosis more unsettling to an otherwise intact sense of health. In contrast, those who already have a number of health conditions or have already experienced more decline in cognition, view an MCI diagnosis as doing little to change their already challenged health status. Another interesting finding was that those who were older reported less of an impact of diagnosis than those who were younger. It may be this reflects a discrepancy between expectations and reality, where younger individuals are more alarmed by a diagnosis of cognitive impairment as there is a greater distance between that reality and the health they envision for themselves. Alternately, perhaps with age comes a greater acceptance of whatever life has in store, and therefore a new diagnosis is less impactful. Regardless of the reasons for these differences, the differences themselves suggest that future interventions may need to take various factors into account to identify those most in need of treatment support.

4.5 Conclusion

The AMQoL Survey allows clinicians to assess the attitudes, behaviors, and treatment needs of persons diagnosed with MCI. Data from the survey demonstrated objective decline, or subjective complaint, that is corroborated by study partners. Data was collected to identify what possible strategies and interventions could be developed to circumvent the development of such behaviors and improve a patient’s disease trajectory and enhance patient’s well-being and quality of life18,19.

The next phase of this work, informed by these findings, will include developing and evaluating customized interventions to address the unique needs of persons diagnosed with MCI. The development of a structured intervention that will facilitate adaptive rather than maladaptive behaviors resulting from the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is a critical need for the field. Findings from the AMQoL survey suggestion interventions targeting failure to plan for future decline, decreased compliance and interactions with medical care providers, decreased confidence and reduced social engagement, increased physical limitations, decreased medication compliance and adherence to medication regimens, and increased assistance in managing one’s finances are needed to promote adaptive responses to MCI diagnosis. In addition to better meeting the needs of persons with a MCI diagnosis, interventions which harness activities that promote delaying the onset and progression of cognitive impairment and MCI are needed and will remain a priority in future research efforts.
