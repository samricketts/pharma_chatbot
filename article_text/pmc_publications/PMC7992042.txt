The propagation of pathological proteins throughout the brain is the primary physiological hallmark of the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). A growing body of evidence indicates that hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins are spread transcellularly between neurons in a prionlike fashion, inducing misfolding and aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles which accumulate along specific connectivity pathways. Earlier transgenic rodent AD models did not capture this disease-relevant spread, and therefore, seeded Tau-propagation models have been developed. Here, mutant human Tau (as isolated protein or packaged into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) viral vector) is stereotaxically injected into select brain regions and its histopathological propagation to downstream neurons quantified. These models offer a faster and more direct mechanism to evaluate genetic components and therapeutic approaches which attenuate Tau spreading in vivo. Recently, these Tau-seeding models have revealed several new targets for AD drug discovery, including nSMase2, SIRT1, p300/CBP, LRP1, and TYROBP, as well as the potential therapeutics based on melatonin and chondroitinase ABC. Importantly, these Tau-propagation rodent models more closely phenocopy the progression of AD in humans and are therefore likely to improve preclinical studies and derisk future moves into clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s Disease Afflicts a Growing Population with Limited Treatment Options.

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia, afflicting nearly 50 million people worldwide with &gt;150 million projected by 2050.1 The sheer prevalence and high burden of AD have propelled extensive research into the biological mechanisms which drive its hallmark neurodegeneration, with the objective of finding targets amenable to therapeutic intervention. However, currently, there are no effective treatments for AD available to patients to stop, or even slow, the course of the disease.

Our understanding of AD was initiated with, and has since been dominated by, the pathophysiology observed in affected postmortem brains including extracellular amyloid plaques, consisting of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), made up of hyperphosphorylated Tau.2 Although 90% of AD cases are sporadic in origin, there are several mendelian genetic mutations (in amyloid precursor protein (APP), and presenilin 1 or 2 (PSEN1/2)) which affect amyloid processing and consistently give rise to an autosomal dominant early onset form of the disease. Based on this background, early efforts to develop AD therapeutics focused on preventing and eliminating Aβ plaque formation by targeting β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, enzymes responsible for the generation of Aβ fragments,3 as well as attempting to remove plaques already present.4 Unfortunately, there has been no demonstrable clinical success to date with drugs designed for these approaches.2,5–8 In response, more recent investigative efforts have focused instead on the NFT which appear to increase in distribution in time correlating with the worsening of cognitive decline.

High-Fidelity Rodent Models of Human AD Are Lacking.

One major challenge to drug discovery research in AD is the lack of high-fidelity rodent models. Mice do not naturally develop either amyloid plaques or NFTs, and the commonly utilized transgenic models expressing human Aβ and/or mutant Tau fail to provide a humanlike testing ground, as evidenced by the multitude of therapeutics successful in mice but which failed in clinical trials.9,10 Although both the NIH (via MODEL-AD) and the UK Dementia Research Institute have initiated the development of new in vivo AD mouse models, currently, research and therapeutic development are severely limited by the available animal models.11,12 The majority of current mouse models available contain transgenic familial mutations shown to result in amyloid pathology. However, many of these models do not simultaneously exhibit Tau pathology, nor do they demonstrate widespread neurodegeneration as in the human disease. Fewer still contain the human transgenes which induce Tau pathology, and only a small number have validated expression of both pathological hallmarks. This paucity of accessible rodent models often results in poor preclinical validation of therapeutic efficacy, or necessitates the use of multiple lines to investigate specific disease and/or treatment mechanisms.

In this Review, we focus our attention on the transcellular propagation of pathophysiological Tau protein as it aggregates to form NFTs. The spread of these along well-characterized pathways correlates strongly with the severity of cognitive impairment in AD patients, which presents an enticing opportunity for therapeutic intervention. To better study the mechanism of this propagation and test novel treatment modalities, researchers have developed Tau-seeded mouse models in which mutant human Tau (as protein or packaged in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector) is introduced into a spatially restricted brain area and its dispersion quantified in connected downstream regions. Finally, we will cover the application of these models to reveal the role of certain genes in modulating the spread of pathological Tau, as well as the efficacy of drug candidates at inhibiting this toxic propagation.

PROPAGATION OF TAU PROTEIN IS A PRIMARY DRIVER OF HUMAN AD

The role of microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAPT) in AD was first suggested by the discovery that multiple mutations within the gene locus were associated with familial forms of frontotemporal dementia and other Tauopathies.13,14 Normally, Tau phosphorylation contributes to its affinity for microtubules, but mutation-induced errors in Tau folding may induce hyperphosphorylation, resulting in dissociation from the bound state and promotion of aggregation into NFTs which leads to neuronal toxicity and cell death.15 Investigators have discovered over 50 mutations in the MAPT gene which induce a variety of consequences for the Tau protein, including altering splicing, changing affinity for microtubules, enhancing phosphorylation, altering posttranslational modifications affecting protein clearance, and increasing the propensity to aggregate.14 Two particular mutations which have enhanced aggregation potential, P301L and P301S, have been used to generate several popular Tauopathy mouse models.16–18

One of the most striking manifestations of human AD is the characteristic progression of Tau aggregates along interconnected pathways from subcortical brain regions into the outer cortical structures.19–22 This systematic distribution is so consistent between patients that six “Braak stages” are used clinically to describe the advancement of AD as it correlated to the extent of pathological protein accumulation. In early stages I and II, pathological proteins remain primarily limited to the transentorhinal region of the perirhinal cortex and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) of the midbrain. In stages III and IV, NFTs have advanced into multiple limbic areas as well as the hippocampal formation. By the late stages V and VI, neurodegeneration and NFTs have spread widely throughout the neocortex and subcortical afferent sites. It is in this late stage that the most deleterious clinical phenotypes emerge, and recent advances of molecular imaging of Tau using positron emission tomography (PET) have demonstrated that the broader Tau burden is associated with more severe cognitive decline.23,24 The development of novel radiotracers which specifically label misfolded Tau has enabled in vivo monitoring of AD-associated protein pathologies in the early stages of disease development, instead of through postmortem analyses as had been required previously.25 Utilizing these novel radiotracers, researchers have confirmed that Tau pathology follows traditional Braak staging in live patients, with early NFTs forming first in the entorhinal cortex before spreading to the hippocampus, and from there out to many functionally connected distal areas, unlike the more diffuse amyloid pathological distribution. Strikingly, this propagation of Tau and NFTs across the brain significantly correlates with cognitive performance and decline longitudinally in patients, suggesting the vital role of Tau in the progressive cognitive impairment characteristic of AD.23

Pathological Human Tau Propagates Transcellularly.

The manner of Tau propagation between neurons and brain regions has been described as “prionlike”, where misfolded protein is transferred from an affected cell to a naïve cell where it then seeds further Tau misfolding.26–30 This hypothesis was formed after studies demonstrated the ability of hyperphosphorylated Tau isolated from Alzheimer’s brains to aggregate with healthy Tau and still induce the formation of NFT-like structures in vitro.31 Further investigations into the prionlike potential of Tau utilized aggregates made of synthetic preformed fibrils (PFFs) of Tau to drive further misfolding of endogenous Tau intracellularly in culture.27,28 This transcellular propagation was further validated by coculture experiments in which cells expressing Tau-YFP and cells expressing Tau-mCherry were incubated together, ultimately resulting in numerous cells with Tau aggregates labeled by both fluorophores.27 Importantly, sarkosyl-insoluble NFTs isolated directly from the brains of AD patients were similarly capable of seeding aggregation formation in cells natively expressing Tau, a phenomenon which can be replicated using Tau isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing a mutant form of human Tau.32,33

Tau Propagation Likely Occurs via Transsynaptic Release of Free Tau and/or the Spread of Tau-Containing Extracellular Vesicles.

While there is strong evidence that pathological Tau transmits along synaptically connected circuits, the mechanism of transcellular transfer remains unclear. Putative mechanisms for the spread include the release of free Tau into the synaptic cleft, and/or the production of Tau-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) which move between cells (Figure 1). Support for the free-Tau hypothesis derives from years of consistent observation of raised levels of extracellular Tau in the CSF of AD patients.34,35 Initially, this Tau was thought to originate in neurons which released it during neurodegenerative cell death, but recent studies have demonstrated that increases in neuronal activity result in more extracellular Tau both in vitro and in vivo.36,37 As action potentials induce extracellular Tau release, synaptic connectivity also enables the transfer of Tau from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons.38,39 This phenomenon has been elegantly explored using microfluidic devices, where the cell bodies of “donor” cells expressing mutant Tau and “recipient” cells without mutant Tau are separated by thin channels which allow only the axons to pass through, demonstrating Tau release emanating from the terminals rather than cell bodies and a limited release of any Tau when these connections have been disrupted.38,40–42 In vivo work using optogenetics and targeted light activation to stimulate neuron firing has replicated the enhanced Tau release and induction of neuronal cell death in the activated region (and downstream connected pathways) in the rTg4510 Tauopathy mouse model.39 A separate study induced neuronal activity via chemogenetic manipulation in neurons expressing mutant Tau, and similarly observed enhanced Tau pathology across distal, yet connected, brain regions.43

In addition to neurons, microglia play an important role in the propagation of Tau protein. Activated microglia precede the local formation of NFTs in synapses of the Transgenic P301S hTau mouse model, are more efficient at phagocytosing and exocytosing seed competent Tau species than neurons or astrocytes, and spatiotemporally correlate with the propagation of hyperphosphorylated Tau.17,44–46 Furthermore, depleting microglia in vivo via clodronate liposome or an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) results in significantly dampened Tau propagation and reduced development of NFTs in hippocampal neurons of transgenic P301S hTau mice.46

Beyond the release of free Tau, a growing body of evidence strongly suggests that Tau is propagated via extracellular vesicles (EVs). These small membrane-bound vesicles of approximately 30–150 nm in diameter are shed by the cell throughout the course of its metabolic and connective interactions containing various elements of cargo including proteins and miRNA.47 These vesicles were originally thought to play the role of intracellular “garbage disposal”; however, they are now understood to be important mediators of intracellular communication, and potentially as a crucial mechanism in the propagation of several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.48 EVs isolated from cultured cells expressing human mutant Tau have been found to have hyperphosphorylated Tau as cargo.49,50 Tau has also been associated with extracellular vesicles isolated from transgenic Tauopathy mice.51 Furthermore, EVs isolated from CSF or plasma collected from human AD patients contains significant packaged hyperphosphorylated Tau.52,53 Of particular note is the work identifying EV content as potential biomarkers for AD progression and diagnosis.54,55 Using mathematical models, several key cargo proteins from neuronally derived plasma EVs have been identified as being important in predicting AD progression with 82% sensitivity and 85% specificity.55 In this study, hyperphosphorylated Tau species, namely, p-Tau181 and p-Tau231, were elevated in AD EVs compared with controls while amyloid β-42 did not show significant alterations.

In addition to being a potential biomarker, isolated EVs carrying Tau have been demonstrated to have the ability to seed misfolding in naïve cells in vitro.50 Cytokine stimulation of primary microglia isolated from P301S hTau-expressing transgenic mice resulted in the high secretion of EVs containing phosphorylated Tau cargo, which were then capable of seeding NFTs in naïve neurons in vitro.44 Furthermore, when isolated EVs containing Tau were injected into ALZ17 mice, which overexpress normal human Tau (hTau), Tau phosphorylation and the formation of soluble oligomers increased.56 That EVs are important in Tau propagation is also supported by studies that have reduced EV biogenesis either pharmacologically or genetically targeting neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2). The enzyme nSMASE2 is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide, one of the lipids critical for exosome formation.47,57 Pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockdown of nSMase2 activity have been shown to reduce Tau accumulation and spread in transgenic tauopathy mouse models.44,58,59 However, to properly assess the impact these genetic pathways and pharmacological approaches have on the cascade of Tau and NFTs in vivo, new rodent models of AD were developed around the idea of seeding Tau into one brain region and evaluating its transcellular distribution.

RODENT MODELS OF TAU PROPAGATION

Substantial progress has been made to elucidate the mechanisms of Tau transmission between neurons using a variety of in vitro tools such as primary neuronal cultures and 3D organoid “mini-brains”.60,61 To assess the role of these mechanisms in vivo, misfolded human Tau protein is exogenously introduced into a mouse brain where it spreads using the same putative pathways as in human AD. The primary mechanism for initiating Tau seeding utilizes location-restricted stereotaxic injections of either mutant Tau protein (“Tau protein model”) or an AAV vector which contains the mutant Tau sequence and strongly drives expression in infected cells (“AAV–Tau model”). To best apply the Tau-propagation models to a wide range of Tauopathy-related investigations, there are three main adjustable variables: the specific Tau species or AAV introduced, the location of initial seeding, and the brain areas in which propagation is assessed. Of course, each experiment can be further tuned by optimization of other attributes, such as the genotype of the mice being seeded, and the time allotted between surgery and evaluation. Here, we have grouped the rodent models into two large classes, defined by the initial injection of either protein Tau or a Tau-containing AAV vector, and highlighted their reported time-course and propagation destinations (Table 1).

Seeded hTau Protein Propagates from the Site of Injection to Downstream Regions along Neuronal Connectivity Pathways.

In the Tau protein-seeded models, mutant Tau isolated from hTau-expressing transgenic mice (PS19, P301L, and rTg4510), synthetic PFFs produced in vitro, and brain extracts from human AD patients have all successfully induced Tau propagation and pathology. The sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of P301S hTau isolated from PS19 transgenic mice induces further Tau misfolding and propagation along synaptically connected (rather than spatially adjacent) pathways downstream of the injection site.26,62,63,88 Further characterizations (via sucrose gradient size stratification and AT8 binding) reveal that only the large (&gt;10 mer) aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau are capable of seeding further aggregation, while the smaller nonphosphorylated Tau species also propagate but do not induce the histopathological NFTs.63 These key seed potential characteristics were consistent both for human Tau isolated from transgenic mice as well as for Tau protein isolated from human AD patient brain extract.73 Following collection of these seed-competent P301S hTau species from the brains of aged PS19 mice, the aggregates were unilaterally injected into the hippocampus and overlaying cortex of young PS19 mice. In as little as 2 weeks, neurons of the ipsilateral dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 area contained AT8+ NFTs, which developed faster than in naïve PS19.62 This propagation continued across the brains of injected animals for 1 to 15 months postseeding, after which NFTs were observed in a number of proximal and distal brain regions with synaptic connectivity to hippocampal and cortical injection sites, including the contralateral hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex, the mammillary nucleus, and multiple regions of the thalamus, as well as distributed within multiple white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum, optic tract, and cerebral peduncle.26,62,63 Importantly, the majority of this characteristic distribution occurs within 2.5 months of seeding.62

Seeding Tau-propagation is also possible using only Tau fibrils, rather than the hyperphosphorylated aggregates isolated from the brains of Tg AD model mice. These PFFs potently induce Tau hyperphosphorylation and pathological buildup of NFTs as early as 2 weeks following their seeding and initiate this cascade and spread with less seed material than isolated hTau protein.64,65 Stereotaxic injections of these PFFs into the LC of young PS19 Tg mice induce propagation of NFTs to regions connected by both afferent and efferent projections, including the entorhinal and frontal cortex, the amygdala and DG, as well as the hypothalamus.66 Similarly to the mouse-derived P301S hTau, PFFs injected unilaterally into the hippocampus and overlaying cortex induced NFT spread to connected regions in 2–3 months, extending to areas as distal as the substantia nigra in the midbrain and brainstem.64,65 Surprisingly, while tangle bearing neuronal loss on the ipsilateral side to the injection site begins at 6 months postinjection, no neuronal degeneration is seen on the contralateral side where tangle bearing neurons gradually clear Tau pathology by 6–12 months postinjection. This model differs from typical AD pathology since the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which are usually affected in the early stages of AD, were not affected.66 PFFs are thought to be taken up by glial endocytosis, but the degree to which inflammatory responses modulate their uptake remains unclear.26,64,65

To more directly address the seed potential of Tau in human AD, sarkosyl-insoluble Tau from brain tissue from human patients may be injected into mice. Unilateral stereotaxic injections into the hippocampus/overlaying cortex or the primary somatosensory area result in propagation of NFTs to connected areas such as the contralateral hippocampus and LC, or the visual cortex and underlying white matter tract of the corpus callosum, respectively.69,71,72 One unique advantage of seeding via human brain extracts is the cell-type specificity of the resultant induced NFTs. When seeded from AD patients, these NFTs are confined largely to neurons. However, if the injected Tau originated from a non-AD Tauopathy, they are observed to propagate between cells of greater variety, suggesting a diversity of cellular sources for seed-competent Tau.71

Interestingly, human paired helical filaments (PHFs) from AD patients not only seed NFT development in mouse models expressing mutant hTau but can also recruit endogenous mouse Tau to aggregate in hyperphosphorylated tangles, which is exceptionally rare in undisturbed mouse Tau and requires extremely long incubation times.73,89 These argyrophilic Tau inclusions also propagate along connectivity pathways, reinforcing their capability for prionlike spread from infected to naïve neurons.69,72 Although seeding of human AD-Tau is sufficient to induce Tau aggregates and NFTs in WT mice, injections into mice expressing Tg Aβ facilitates the in vivo transition from pretaupathic to hyperphosphorylated Tau and results in accelerated propagation.70 Injecting mutant Tau into a transgenic amyloid mouse may help to illuminate the interactions between Aβ and the spread of NFTs, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood with few rodent models expressing both pathological proteins.

Tau Seeding by Inducing Expression of Mutant Tau via AAV-hTau Viral Vectors.

Another technique for seeding Tau utilizes stereotaxically injected AAV vectors containing Tau DNA under the control of strong constitutive promotors (AAV–Tau). There are several advantages to the use of AAV–Tau propagation models including a more rapid propagation of aggregation (~1 month),78 ability to attain cell-type specificity of seeding,90 and capacity to include fluorescent markers to distinguish infected NFT+ cells from propagated NFT+ regions.75 The species of Tau delivered via AAV meaningfully impacts both the spread and downstream impact of its introduction. Seeding a vector containing transcript for WT hTau results in significant hyperphosphorylation without aggregation, and ultimately neuronal dysfunction, while a similar proaggregating species propagates NFTs broadly but does not impact cell survival.83 In contrast, both forms of mutant Tau (P301L or P301S) show enhanced propagation of soluble Tau as well as NFTs selectively between connected neuronal pathways.86 For example, injection of AAV-hTau-P301L into the entorhinal cortex of WT mice induces the trans-synaptic spread of NFTs to the hippocampal DG in only 4 weeks, a time-course further accelerated in older mice.44,75 In fact, the introduction of P301L-hTau into the mouse lateral entorhinal cortex via AAV induced Tau-mediated neurodegeneration and synapse loss along the entire perforant pathway beginning only 10–14 days following injection.78 The easy manipulations of viral vectors allow for further refinements of the AAV–Tau model. By integrating a FLEX domain upstream of the Tau protein code and injecting into Crerecombinase driver mouse lines, production of Tau may be limited both spatially (by injection) as well as genetically to only those cells Cre+.76 Importantly, the Tau protein produced by cells infected by AAV–Tau are subject to physiological levels of astro- and microgliosis and similarly induce the characteristic neurodegeneration which forms a hallmark of human AD.74,81,83 In fact, intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of AAV-hTau-P301L or bilateral injections of the same vector into the MEC are sufficient for inducing behavioral phenotypes of cognitive impairments and decline, such as worsening performance on novel object recognition tasks after 1 month postinjection.80,87

Limitations of Tau Propagation Models.

One putative limitation in the Tau-seeded mouse model is the unknown fidelity of response to exogenous human mutant Tau in mouse brains. Are the mechanisms of human Tau disbursement in the mouse brain relevant? This is the concern for many of the cited papers, but few characterize the differences in in vivo propagation depending on the species source of Tau protein. We know from in vitro experiments that pathological Tau is carried within nSMase2 catalyzed EVs, but is this mechanism the natural way of carrying human Tau in AD patients, or is it being upregulated by the foreign nature of the seeded Tau protein or virus? Unfortunately, this is an issue across nearly all of the rodent AD models, where transgenic human mutant Tau must be used to produce NFTs but may not be processed and spread by the relevant endogenous mechanisms we hope to discover and target. As with most AD modeling in mice, this issue will likely only be overcome by the application of multiple in vitro and in vivo models to approach the target and/or evaluate the therapeutic from various vantages.

Ultimately, AD is likely to always frustrate attempts at perfectly modeling its progression in rodents in vivo. The endogenous hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein and its accumulation into neurotoxic aggregates seem to be a primate-specific dysfunction. However, we know that the characteristic patterned spread of pathological proteins is associated with disease severity, and therefore, better modeling of Tau propagation will further enable disease-modulating drug discovery and development research.

NOVEL DRUG TARGETS IDENTIFIED USING TAU PROPAGATION MODELS

Multiple investigations have utilized the seeded rodent models of Tau propagation detailed above to investigate novel therapeutic approaches for ameliorating Tauopathies (Table 2).

Targeting Components of Autophagy and EV Biogenesis Pathways May Limit Tau Spread.

One manner through which the Tau-protein injection model may be utilized is to assess the therapeutic potential of Tau-modulating genetic targets. For example, to determine the neuroprotective capability of the nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent class-III protein deacetylase SIRT1, investigators simultaneously injected synthetic Tau PFFs into one hemispheric hippocampus while driving overexpression of SIRT1 via AAV in the contralateral hippocampus.67,91 After 1 month, those hippocampi which overexpressed SIRT1 exhibited significantly less evidence of NFT accumulation, indicating the ability of SIRT to attenuate the propagation of pathological Tau species. Using the same model, researchers induced conditional knockdowns of p300/CBP contralateral to hippocampal injections of Tau fibrils and demonstrated significantly reduced spread of NFTs to both the knockdown hippocampus as well as more broadly through the cortex, reaffirming the therapeutic potential of p300/CBP inhibition for attenuation of Tau propagation in AD.68,92

Focal Tau introduction via stereotaxic injection of an AAV–Tau vector has also been used to explore modulators of Tau propagation. For example, the spread of NFTs from the medial entorhinal cortex of mice injected with AAV-hTau-P301L can be significantly reduced by depletion of microglia or targeted knockdown of nSMase2 in microglial cells.46 Furthermore, the small-molecule nSMase2 inhibitor GW4869 similarly inhibited the spread of NFTs, highlighting both the importance of microglia and EVs in the mechanism of Tau propagation, as well as the basis for new therapeutic approaches in AD.46 However, due to issues of potency, insolubility, and CNS penetrance, GW4868 is a poor candidate for clinical application. Our lab has recently developed a novel small-molecule nSMase2 inhibitor, phenyl(R)-(1-(3-(3,4-dimethox-yphenyl)-2,6-dimethylimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazin-8-yl)pyrrolidin-3-yl)-carbamate (PDDC), with nanomolar potency, excellent oral bioavailability, and a high brain to plasma ratio which is capable of inhibiting EV release both in vitro and in vivo.93 We are currently evaluating its efficacy in seeded human Tau models.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Tau internalization, an in vitro knockdown screen in neurons was performed where the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) was identified to effect Tau propagation.77 Of mouse hippocampi injected with AAV-hTau, those pretreated with knockdowns of LRP1 exhibited dramatically less propagation. These results suggest that interventions aimed at the LRP1 pathway may allow for attenuation of Tau spread by limiting neuronal endocytosis of pathological Tau species. In a similar application of this virally seeded model, constitutive knockout of the tyrosine motif binding protein TYROBP reduced deficits in learning and memory behaviors induced by bilateral injections of AAV-P301L in the entorhinal cortexes yet, paradoxically, worsened the Tau burden.85 We speculate that TYROBP (and other putative genes in related pathways) may aid microglia in discerning the seed-capable pretangle Tau species from other nonharmful soluble species before they are loaded into EV destined for other cells.

Gene–Environment Interactions Contribute to Spread of Tau Pathologies.

The AAV–Tau seeded model has been utilized to explore the interactions of other contributors to disease progression in Tauopathies. For example, patients with type-2 diabetes and/or chronic obesity are at significantly increased risk of developing AD later in life,94 but the mechanism which underlies this predisposition remains unclear. To address this question, investigators transduced the AAV-P301L vector into P0 pups of the well-established leptin receptor knockout diabetes/obesity mouse model. Over time, the ratio of hyperphosphorylated Tau to total Tau grew more rapidly in the leptin knockout mice resulting in earlier and more severe markers of pathological Tau; much like what is observed in human patients.84 For some patients with Parkinson’s Disease caused by a specific mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (G2019S-Lrrk), dopaminergic neuron loss is accompanied by pathological Tau protein accumulation and progressive neurodegeneration. However, exactly how this mutation effects Tau phosphorylation is unknown. Interestingly, while deletion of Lrrk has little to no effect on the spread of Tau and NFTs in vivo, the inclusion of the G2019S mutation does drive the transcellular propagation of pathological Tau between synaptically connected hippocampal neurons, suggesting a possible target for intervention for this patient subgroup.86

In addition to histopathological outcomes for drug discovery research, researchers using the AAV–Tau have explored the impact of new treatment modalities on cognition and behavior. icv injection of AAV–Tau results in significant markers of neuroinflammation and deterioration of cognitive performance 28 days postinjection. However, this decline may be mitigated by the delivery of exogenous melatonin supplementation between day 7 and 28, suggesting the potential for melatonin-based therapeutics.80 Another entirely distinct paradigm for treating neurodegenerative disorders focuses on the restoration of neuroplasticity in diseased individuals. To model such a loss in plasticity, investigators bilaterally injected the perirhinal cortex of mice, which then exhibited reduced synaptic transmission and memory deficits like those observed in AD patients. Researchers then treated the mice with chondroitinase ABC (ChABC), which disrupts the perineuronal nets of the local extracellular matrix and stimulates increased plasticity.87 Strikingly, although the transcellular spread of mutant hTau was unaffected, the ChABC treatment increased neuronal development in the region and restored functional memory in these mice.

One further challenge for studying both AD and developing putative treatments is a focus on the progression of the disease, rather than the underlying etiology. While Tau-seeded models may reveal new genes, pathways, mutations, and exogenous influences which affect the course of the disease, the model itself begins in medias res and is therefore poorly positioned to assess causative contributors to disease onset. These leading factors would be of particular interest to drug discovery research, as finding a treatment which prevents the initiation of the AD cascade would revolutionize clinical treatments. Instead, the Tau-seeded model may be used to evaluate therapeutic targets involved in the course of the disease, as pathologies propagate and accumulate over time. Therapeutic interventions on these targets would seek to slow the progression of cognitive and physical decline.

CONCLUSION

The pursuit of novel therapeutic approaches to address AD has resulted in a broad reshaping of our understanding of the disease. Despite the prominent role of Aβ in the history of AD research, many drugs designed to reduce the buildup of these extracellular plaques have failed to alleviate disease symptoms in clinical trials. Recent attention has turned to the propagation of intracellular NFTs, which are more strongly correlated with neurodegeneration and disease severity. The prionlike spread of misfolded Tau protein presents new opportunities for therapeutic interventions designed to attenuate the progression of AD, with the evaluation and development of these approaches best assessed preclinically via seeded rodent models of Tau propagation. These two concepts work in tandem to improve upon our current AD drug development pipeline by focusing on Tau as the neuropathic component in animal models which better replicate the characteristic staging of human AD. Importantly, this tact provides an operationalized platform for efficient and targeted evaluation of Tau propagation-modulating drugs.

Of course, it remains likely that Tau/NFTs are only one factor within the complex mixture of genetic, molecular, environmental, and behavioral factors which all impact the manifestation of AD in humans. However, recent evidence has reaffirmed their importance in the characteristic cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration exhibited as patients decline. We propose, therefore, that while limiting the propagation of Tau protein is unlikely to cure AD, a novel therapy which effectively attenuates its spread may still have powerfully beneficial effects on the rate of disease progression, and therefore quality of life for millions of suffering patients and caretakers.

The schematic depicts the proposed mechanisms of prionlike Tau propagation between neurons. Hyperphosphorylated Tau becomes misfolded and prompts aggregation into NFTs, which result in cell death and neurodegeneration. Misfolded Tau propagates between neurons as free protein released into the synapse, or contained within neuronal-derived EVs. Free Tau and NFTs released during cell death are taken up by microglia and transported to additional cells within microglial-derived EVs. In a naïve neuron, misfolded Tau induces further misfolding of native Tau in a prionlike manner, resulting in NFT aggregation in downstream neurons. Figure created with Biorender.com.
