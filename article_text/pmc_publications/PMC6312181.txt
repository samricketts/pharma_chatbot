The phospholipase D3 (PLD3) gene has shown association with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the role of PLD3 common variants in amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology remains unclear. We examined the association of thirteen common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1–42 levels and florbetapir retention on florbetapir 18F amyloid positron emission tomography (AV45-PET) in a large population. We found that one SNP (rs11667768) was significantly associated with CSF Aβ1–42 levels in the normal cognition group. We did not observe an association of any SNP with florbetapir retention. Our study predicted the potential role of PLD3 variants in Aβ pathology.

INTRODUCTION

Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition is considered to be the major pathological feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the pathophysiological process related to brain amyloidosis is ongoing years prior to any clinical manifestations [1]. This has placed a great emphasis on identifying factors and mechanisms that promote brain amyloidosis. To date, several genetic variants in APOE, CALHM1, and PICALM have been reported to show association with Aβ deposition [2, 3]. Phospholipase D3 (PLD3) gene, coding for the PLD3 protein, is a new candidate gene for AD. Recent work has demonstrated that PLD3 was involved in the processing of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and might play an important role in Aβ deposition [4]. Given that PLD3 has been shown to correlate with AD, the role of PLD3 common variants in Aβ pathology is still unclear.

The brain amyloid burden could be sensitively detected by some amyloid-related phenotypes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1–42 and florbetapir 18F amyloid positron emission tomography (AV45-PET) have both shown high specificity in reflecting brain amyloid burden, and are proposed as established endophenotypes for AD [5, 6]. Moreover, AD pathology could be found in the brains of nondemented elderly and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and genetic factors might play different roles at different levels of disease severity. Therefore, the goal of our study is to investigate a possible association between PLD3 variants and Aβ-related phenotypes in normal cognition (NC), MCI, and AD patients separately, as well as combined diagnosis subjects.

METHODS

Participants

All participants included in this study were enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, a multicenter publicly funded longitudinal study of individuals with AD, MCI, and NC. Here, we restricted the present analysis to participants whose genotype data of PLD3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available. Furthermore, we selected only non-Hispanic (Caucasian) participants in order to avoid the population stratification effects which can lead to spurious findings. Finally, 812 individuals including 281 NC, 483 MCI (including 63 who converted to AD and 420 who did not), and 48 AD were included in our study.

Genotyping

We extracted the SNP genotypes of PLD3 from the genome wide association study of ADNI for all included participants. Details of the genotyping methods were presented previously [7]. After quality control procedures, thirteen tag SNPs which captured the greatest amount of common variations in PLD3 (rs7249146, rs11667768, rs10422343, rs4490097, rs11666860, rs12151243, rs45441197, rs11672825, rs10407447, rs4254419, rs4803330, rs62107640, rs112703240) remained for data analysis.

CSF Aβ1–42 measures

Methods for CSF acquisition and biomarker measurement using the ADNI cohort have been reported previously [8]. The CSF concentrations of Aβ1–42 were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with Innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3; Ghent, Belgium; for research use-only reagents) immunoassay kit–based reagents. CSF measures for this article were cross-sectional from the baseline evaluation. The final samples for CSF analyses included 609 individuals (201 NC, 367 MCI, and 41 AD) with baseline CSF and corresponding genetic data.

AV45-PET measures

The AV45-PET phenotypic data were processed by the Jagust Lab, the University of Berkeley. A detailed description of PET image acquisition and processing can be found at http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/pet/. Briefly, we extracted the mean florbetapir uptake of four cortical grey matter regions (frontal, angerior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, lateral temporal) and cortical standard uptake value ratios (SUVR). SUVR were calculated by averaging across the four cortical regions and dividing this average by whole cerebellum. Each mean florbetapir uptake of the four main regions and cortical SUVR were used for analysis. Of the 812 participants, we included 707 participants (including 237 NC, 423 MCI, and 47 AD) in AV45-PET analysis.

Data analysis

Demographic characteristics of our subjects were presented using means and standard deviations (SD) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Demographics and genotypic frequencies were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or chi-square tests. Each of the thirteen SNPs was examined for associations with amyloid-related phenotypes for each diagnostic group separately (NC, MCI, and AD) and the entire cohort. Additionally, we also stratified the MCI group into MCI converting to dementia (MCI converter) and MCI not converting to dementia (MCI nonconverter). We used a multiple linear regression model to test for the independent associations and the dosage effect of each minor allele, controlling for age, gender, education, and number of APOE ε4 allele. To account for multiple testing, we performed a Bonferroni correction (pc) for the number of tests applied in each analysis. All results were reported as statistically significant if p &lt; 0.05.

RESULTS

The demographics, clinical data, and SNP distributions are summarized in Table 1. No statistical differences were observed among NC, MCI, and AD patients when comparing the distribution of all the tested SNPs allele frequencies in our study.

After Bonferroni correction, only rs11667768 was significant associated with CSF Aβ1–42 level in the NC group (p = 0.00048, pc = 0.006) (Fig. 1). For rs11667768, minor allele carriers showed higher CSF Aβ1–42 levels in a dose-dependent manner (CC &lt; TC&lt;TT), suggesting that the minor T allele was associated with less amyloid burden. Moreover, we observed some nominal associations between three SNPs (rs11667768, rs11666860, and rs62107640) and CSF Aβ1–42 levels in the MCI group (p = 0.037, p = 0.045, and p = 0.035, respectively). However, no association remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction (Supplementary Table 1). There was no evidence for an effect of all SNPs on CSF Aβ1–42 levels in the AD group, combined group, and two MCI subgroups.

Regarding the AV45-PET analysis, we did not observe any association of all SNPs with florbetapir retention in four main regions (frontal, angerior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, lateral temporal), as well as the cortical SUVR in all groups. Although we detected some nominal associations for three SNPs on florbetapir retention before Bonferroni correction, these associations were not significant after multiple testing correction (Supplementary Table 1).

DISCUSSION

PLD3 was a non-classical poorly characterized member of the PLD superfamily of phospholipases, playing an important role in myogenesis during myotube formation [9]. Recently, Cruchaga et al. first reported that PLD3 was implicated in AβPP trafficking. Overexpression of PLD3 led to a significant decrease in extracellular Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40, and knockdown of PLD3 leaded to a significant increase in extracellular Aβ1–42 and Aβ1–40 [4]. Therefore, the role of PLD3 in AD might be mediated by modifying the expression level of PLD3, and subsequently influencing the Aβ deposition. It also should be noted that rare coding variants of PLD3 had been identified as AD susceptibility loci, whereas the role of common variants in AD remains unknown. In the current study, we found an association between rs11667768 and Aβ-related phenotype (CSF Aβ1–42), suggesting that this common SNP might play a role in Aβ pathology. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the role of PLD3 SNPs using an intermediate phenotype approach in a large sample at different levels of disease severity.

AD pathology is restricted to the brain, and hence CSF, which can reflect biochemical changes in the brain, is an optimal source of biomarkers (i.e., Aβ1–42, total tau protein, and phosphorylated tau protein) for AD [10]. Of these biomarkers, Aβ1–42 appears to be the core biochemical marker for the amyloidogenic process in AD. Several studies have reported a relationship between decreased CSF Aβ1–42 and amyloid load in the brain [11, 12]. The present study demonstrated that one SNP (rs11667768) was strongly associated with Aβ1–42 levels in normal population, independent of APOE. T allele carriers had significantly higher CSF Aβ1–42 levels and a linear trend was observed. The most widely accepted explanation for the decreased CSF Aβ1–42 in AD is that aggregation of Aβ into plaques results in reduced availability of Aβ to diffuse into the CSF [13]. Therefore, it may be that genetic variants in rs11667768 influenced pathways related to the aggregation of Aβ in the brain. This common SNP identified here might lie within the same linkage dis-equilibrium (LD) block with rare functional variants and have a potential effect on the expression or function of PLD3. It is worth noting that we did not find an association of rs11667768 with CSF Aβ1–42 levels in MCI, AD, and the combined group. This might be explained because rs11667768 functions differently in individuals with normal cognition verses those with MCI and AD. Thence, rs11667768 contributes to brain amyloid burden in a way that can only be detected in normal populations. Minor T allele correlated with higher Aβ1–42 levels was predicted to be protective for Aβ pathology in healthy adults.

None of the presently investigated SNPs showed significant association with florbetapir retention detected by AV45-PET. Currently, AV45-PET has generated increasing interest as a novel imaging agent to detect Aβ plaques [14]. In our study, AV45 uptake was evaluated in four target brain regions, which might not reflect the amyloid load of whole brain. Therefore, the lack of association might be a result of low statistical power, sample sizes, or more probably, not appropriate target brain regions (i.e., hippocampus, precuneus). Nevertheless, more association studies with larger sample sizes and more brain regions are still needed to confirm the present findings.

In conclusion, we have found one PLD3 variant (rs11667768) associated with amyloid burden detected by CSF in normal individuals, suggesting the potential role of PLD3 in Aβ pathology. Although this variant might specifically influence healthy individuals, it still could provide new insights into the underlying association between PLD3 and AD. Further studies are now warranted to disentangle the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the influence of PLD3 on Aβ1–42.
