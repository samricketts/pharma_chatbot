Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) have become increasingly popular in identifying genes (or other endophenotypes or exposures) associated with complex traits. In TWAS, one first builds a predictive model for gene expressions using an eQTL dataset in stage 1, then tests the association between the predicted gene expression and a trait based on a large, independent GWAS dataset in stage 2. However, since the sample size of the eQTL dataset is usually small and the coefficient of multiple determination (i.e. R2) of the model for many genes is also small, a question of interest is to what extent these factors affect the statistical power of TWAS. In addition, in contrast to a standard (univariate) TWAS (UV-TWAS) considering only a single gene at a time, multivariate TWAS (MV-TWAS) methods have recently emerged to account for the effects of multiple genes, or a gene’s non-linear effects, simultaneously. With the absence of the power analysis for these MV-TWAS methods, it would be of interest to investigate whether one can gain or lose power by using the newly proposed MV-TWAS instead of UV-TWAS. In this paper, we first outline a general method for sample size/power calculations for two-sample TWAS, then use real data - the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) eQTL data and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) eQTL data for stage 1, the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS summary data and UK Biobank (UKB) individual level data for stage 2 - to empirically address these questions. Our most important conclusions are the following. First, a sample size of a few thousands (~8000) would suffice in stage 1, where the power of TWAS would be more determined by cis-heritability of gene expression. Second, as in the general case of simple regression versus multiple regression, the power of MV-TWAS may be higher or lower than that of UV-TWAS, depending on the specific relationships among the GWAS trait and multiple genes (or linear and non-linear terms of the same gene’s expression levels), such as their correlations and effect sizes. Interestingly, several top genes with large power gains in MV-TWAS (over that in UV-TWAS) were known to be (and in our data more significantly) associated with AD. We also reached similar conclusions in an application to the GTEx whole blood gene expression data and UK Biobank GWAS data of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The proposed method and the conclusions are expected to be useful in planning and designing future TWAS and other related studies (e.g. proteome-or metabolome-wide association studies) when determining the sample sizes for the two stages.

pmc1 Introduction

Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) have been increasingly applied to identify genes associated with complex traits (Gusev et al., 2016). The statistical principle underlying TWAS is (two-sample) two-stage least squares (2SLS) (Gamazon et al., 2015; Gusev et al., 2016). In stage 1, for a candidate gene, a regression model is often trained on a small eQTL dataset to predict its expression level using its cis-SNPs. Then in stage 2, the pre-trained model is used to predict the gene expression (of the candidate gene) using the SNPs from a much larger genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset that is independent of the eQTL dataset in stage 1; then the predicted gene expression is tested for association with the trait of the GWAS data to determine whether there is association between the gene and the trait. If an association is established, under the framework of instrumental variable (IV) regression and its related valid IV assumptions, the gene can be interpreted as (putative) causal, similar to Mendelian randomization (MR) (Angrist et al., 1996; Xue et al., 2020). For stage 1, various methods, including stepwise variable selection coupled with ordinary least squares, lasso and elastic net penalized regression, and some Bayesian methods, have been applied to select cis-SNPs to be IVs while building a predictive model for gene expression (Gamazon et al., 2015; Gusev et al., 2016; Xue et al., 2020). In contrast, in stage 2 typically a simple regression or a univariate association test is conducted. It is also notable that GWAS summary data, not necessarily GWAS individual-level, can be applied in stage 2, largely facilitating the wide applicability of TWAS (Gusev et al., 2016).

Despite of the success of TWAS in discovering important gene-trait associations (and putative causal genes for traits) (Gamazon et al., 2015; Gusev et al., 2016), some important questions remain open. First, although the GWAS dataset used in stage 2 usually contains from tens to hundreds of thousands of individuals, the eQTL dataset is often quite small with a sample size of only a few hundreds or thousands. To what extent does the difference in sample sizes affect the power of TWAS? We therefore study the effects of the stage 1 and stage 2 sample sizes on the power of TWAS. Second, the predictive power as measured by coefficient of multiple determination, R2, of a pre-trained model in stage 1 is usually very low with R2 ≤ 0.05. Part of the reason is that the predictive power is upper-bounded by the gene’s expression heritability (Gamazon et al., 2015). Assuming that a lower R2 is partly due to the small sample size (and thus large estimation errors), if we were able to increase R2, how much would that boost the power of TWAS? Lastly, in contrast to a standard (univariate) TWAS (UV-TWAS) considering only a single gene at a time, multivariate TWAS (MV-TWAS) have recently emerged to account for the effects of multiple genes, or of a gene’s linear and non-linear effects (Knutson et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2022). We are not aware of any studies on the power of MV-TWAS. In particular, it would be of interest to investigate whether one can gain or lose power by using MV-TWAS as compared to UV-TWAS: while accounting for multiple related genes’ (predicted) expression levels may boost power, the expected presence of their correlations may reduce the precision of the estimates and thus statistical power.

We will use real data, mainly the ADNI gene expression data (Shen et al., 2013) and the IGAP Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS summary data (Li et al., 2002), to empirically answer these questions. More specifically, we will use the fitted gene expression imputation models with the ADNI eQTL data and the fitted TWAS models with the IGAP GWAS data as the true models (with the true parameter values) in power/sample size calculations, which are more realistic than some arbitrarily chosen simulation models or parameter values to mimic unknown truths, leading to more meaningful conclusions to guide the study design for future TWAS. In addition, we will also apply the methods to the GTEx gene expression data and UK Biobank GWAS data (GTEx Consortium, 2020; Sudlow et al., 2015). We will propose a general approach to sample size/power calculations for both univariate and multivariate TWAS, which can be applied to plan future TWAS and other related studies (such as Proteome- or Metabolome-Wide Association Studies). In particular, since both TWAS and MR are special cases of IV regression (Burgess et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2020), one may wonder whether we could simply follow an approach used for MR to calculate the power for TWAS. The short answer is no. Most power calculation methods for MR either account for only a single IV or focus on one-sample problems (Brion et al., 2012; Burgess, 2014; Freeman et al., 2013; Pierce et al., 2010). Deng et al (L. Deng et al., 2020) proposed a general procedure allowing for both two-sample setups and multiple (independent) IVs, but they assumed a single exposure. In contrast, we aim to inspect multivariate TWAS models with multiple (possibly correlated) exposures and multiple correlated IVs/SNPs, comparing their power to that of the standard/univariate TWAS. We note that our proposed sample size/power calculation method is general for two-sample 2SLS, applicable not only to (two-sample) TWAS (and related Proteome- or Metabolome-Wide Association Studies), but also to (two-sample) multivariable MR with possibly correlated SNPs/IVs (Burgess and Thompson, 2015; Burgess et al., 2015; Porcu et al., 2019).

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we first introduce the general TWAS model along with necessary notations, then three specific TWAS models, whose power will be studied. Next, we propose a general sample size/power calculation procedure that can be applied to TWAS analyses, followed by the real datasets to be used. In Section 3, we apply the proposed method to the real datasets, addressing the three questions mentioned above. In Section 4, we summarize the main results, discuss the importance of the findings, and point out some potential limitations of the current study.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 A general TWAS model

Let n1 and n2 be the sample sizes of the eQTL and GWAS data in stages 1 and 2, respectively. We assume that there are no overlaps between the two datasets; that is, the two samples are independent as required by the two-sample 2SLS. For a given gene of interest, let Z1 be an n1 × p matrix coding for its cis-SNPs as IVs in the eQTL dataset, Z2 be an n2 × p matrix for the IVs in the GWAS dataset, x0 be an n1 × 1 vector of the observed expression levels of the gene in the eQTL dataset, and Y be an n2 × 1 vector of the GWAS trait; p is the numbers of the IVs/SNPs used to predict the gene’s expression. Following these notations and the standard valid IV assumptions, a general TWAS model is (1) X=Z1β+v1,

(2) X2=Z2β+v2,

(3) Y=X2θ+u=Z2βθ+v2θ+u=Z2βθ+ω

where X =(x0, x1, ..., x(q–1)) with x1, ..., x(q–1) being either higher order terms of x0 or expression levels of other genes related to the gene of interest in the eQTL data; X2 would be the gene’s expression levels in the GWAS data, though not actually observed, and X^2=Z2β^ is the imputed gene expression levels; θ =(θ0,...,θ(q–1))T is a q×1 vector of the (unknown) causal effects of interest, and β = (β0,...,β(q–1)) is a p × q matrix for the (unknown) regression coefficients; ν1 and ν2 are independent error terms as n1 × q and n2 × q matrices, each row of which is independently and normally distributed with mean 0 and covariance matrix Σν. Independent of ν1, the error term u is an n2 × 1 vector following a normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix σu2I, and the error term ω is an n2 × 1 vector following a normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix σω2I.

For simplicity of notation, we assume that X and Y are already suitably adjusted for covariates, and variables Z1, Z2, X and Y are standardized to have their sample means all equal to 0 and sample variances to 1. Furthermore, here we assume that the GWAS individual-level data are available for simplicity and clarity of presentation, but in practice only GWAS summary data are required in stage 2 as to be shown in our numerical examples.

This general TWAS model allows us to accommodate more general cases than the standard TWAS where genes are imputed and tested only one by one (i.e. with q = 1). For example, in contrsat to the standard TWAS of imputing and tesing only a linear term x0, one can impute x0 and x02 in stage 1 and test both terms in stage 2 to account for possibly non-linear effects of gene expression; doing so can gain power and identify additional genes (Lin et al., 2022). When q is 1 and larger than 1, the general TWAS model represents the UV-TWAS and MV-TWAS respectively.

Applying (two-sample) 2SLS (i.e. ordinary least squares (OLS) in each stage), we obtain the estimators for the unknown parameters in the general TWAS model as β^=Z1TZ1−1Z1TX,X^2=Z2β^,θ^=(X^2TX^2)−1X^2TY,Σ^v=(X−Z1β^)T(X−Z1β^)/n1−1,σ^ω2=Y−X^2θ^22/n2.

Note that our proposed methods require the use of OLS estimator (OLSE), or more generally, maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), in each stage as used above, because the (corrected) covariance matrix formula for θ^ to be shown later is based on the OLSE (or MLE).

2.2 Some specific TWAS methods

2.2.1 UV-TWAS

We first consider the standard (univariate) TWAS, testing the linear effects of the genes one by one with X = x0, denoted as UV-L. For this model, we focused on studying the impact of the sample size and the stage 1 pre-trained model’s predictive capability as measured by coefficient of multiple determination, R2, on the power of TWAS. We increased the sample size of stage 1 by a factor of 1, 2, 5 and 10, the sample size of stage 2 by a factor of 1, 1.2, 1.5, and 2, and the R2 of the fitted imputation model by 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 (but capped the final increased R2 at ≤ 0.95) to examine their influences on the power. Note that we increase the R2 by a fixed amount, not relative to the original R2, to see the direct effects of R2. The calculation of R2 can be found in section 2.2.4.

As noted in (Lin et al., 2022), the quadratic effect of gene expression can be regarded as the influence of a gene’s expression variability on the trait. We therefore also consider another UV-TWAS model, denoted as UV-Q, in which we test the quadratic term of gene expression on a trait with X=x02 (i.e. with only a quadratic term and no linear term). We will compare the power of this model to that of MV-TWAS to be introduced later.

2.2.2 TWAS-LQ

As shown in (Lin et al., 2022), testing for quadratic effects of gene expression may unveil additional genes whose expression levels are non-linearly associated with a trait. In this extended MV-TWAS model, denoted TWAS-LQ, we consider both linear and quadratic terms of gene expression. In other words, we have X=(x0,x02) and test the corresponding θ in the model as described in (1)-(7). For power calculations, we set θ˜=θ^ as estimated from the IGAP AD GWAS summary data, and used the corrected covariance matrix formula. Depending on which components of θ to be tested, we can have three approaches, called TWAS-L, TWAS-Q, and TWAS-LQ respectively: we test only the linear component, the quadratic component and both linear and quadratic components, respectively.

2.2.3 Other MV-TWAS

One possible downside of MV-TWAS with multiple genes is that their correlated gene expression levels may lead to the loss of power as compared with UV-TWAS. Here we consider a possibly more extreme situation where we expect greater loss of power: because many physically neighboring genes have correlated expression levels (and their expression levels are often more highly correlated if they are closer to each other), we include every two neighboring genes in the MV-TWAS model. That is, if x0 and x1 are the expression levels of two neighboring genes, we have X =(x0, x1) in the MV-TWAS model. This set-up is both more challenging and useful for TWAS because we often would like to identify which gene (among several with correlated expression) in a GWAS trait-associated locus is indeed causal. Similar to TWA-SLQ, in MV-TWAS we consider the power for three tests, called MV-Target, MV-Alternative and MV-Joint, to test the (linear) effects of the first gene, of its neighbor, and of both the genes, respectively.

2.2.4 Coefficient of multiple determination

For each UV-TWAS model, the coefficient of multiple determination R2 was calculated as R2=1−RSS/TSS=1−RSS/(n1−1)=1−Σ^v,

where RSS and TSS were the residual sum of squares and the total sum of squares for the model; the second equality in the above equation follows from the fact that each X was standardized to have a sample variance of 1; that is, Var(X) = TSS/(n1 – 1) = 1. To assess the effects of different R2 on the power of TWAS, we simply changed the value of Σ^v: for example, to increase R2 by 0.1, we set the new Σ^v to max(0.05,Σ^v−0.1) and then used the new Σ^v in the power calculation. Note that this capped R2 at 0.95.

The R2 can be interpreted as the (estimated) cis-heritability of the gene’s expression levels based on the gene’s cis-SNPs, which is expected to be lower than the gene’s heritability based on the genome-wide SNPs (i.e. both cis- and trans-SNPs).

2.3 Power calculations

The standard TWAS estimate of the variance of θ^ ignores the estimation errors with X^, or equivalently, with β^, in stage 1, thereby under-estimating the true variance. We adopt the formula in (Inoue and Solon, 2010) for a corrected covariance matrix estimate of θ^ as (4) Var^c(θ^)=Var^S(θ^)1+n2n1θ^TΣ^vθ^/σ^ω2

where Var^S(θ^)=(X^2TX^2)−1σ^ω2 is the standard/naive variance estimate, which ignores the estimation variability in stage 1 and thus would be obtained under the assumption of n1 = ∞. The formula clearly illustrates that if the sample size in stage 1 is much smaller than that in stage 2, then we will have an inflated variance and thus reduced power in stage 2. With the corrected estimate of the covariance matrix, we now outline the hypothesis testing procedure as follows. Let q be the number of exposures (columns of X), r be the number of exposures we want to test, A = {A1,...,Ar} be a given subset of {1,2,...,q} with each Ai ∈ {1,...,q} and 1 ≤ r ≤ q. For each gene, we aim to perform the following test in stage 2 with (5) H0:θA=0v.sH1:θA=θ˜A≠0,

where θA=(θA1,…,θAr)T is a subvector of θ to be tested, and here we let θ˜A=θ^A, i.e. we use the estimated effects as the real effects under the alternative. Then Var^c(θ^A), the estimated covariance matrix of θ^A, is just the corresponding submatrix of Var^c(θ^). The TWAS test statistic is (6) T=θ^ATVar^c(θ^A)−1θ^A,

which has a central χr2 distribution under the null H0; however, under the alternative H1, T follows a non-central χ2 distribution with r degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter θ˜ATVar^c(θ^A)−1θ˜A. The power is given by (7) P(T≥χr,1−α/m2∣H1),

where α is the nominal significance level, m is the number of genes to be tested, and χr,1−α/m2 is the (1–α/m)th quantile of a central χ2 distribution with r degrees of freedom. Here we follow the popular practice of using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple testing in TWAS.

2.4 Data

2.4.1 The ADNI eQTL data

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a 60 million, 5-year public private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California — San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.org.

We used the ADNI whole genome sequencing (WGS) and gene expression data (Shen et al., 2013) as the eQTL data in stage 1. After removing 37 individuals with any missing data, we had n1 = 711 individuals and 17256 genes. Following previous ADNI studies (Lin et al., 2022), we adjusted for five covariates, namely age, gender, year of education, handedness (left or right handed), and intracranial volume (ICV). We regressed the gene expression (X) on these covariates and then used the standardized residuals as the new X to remove any potential effects they may have on AD, as shown by previous studies (Doody et al., 1999; van Loenhoud et al., 2022). For each gene, we extracted the SNPs from its cis-region by expanding 100kb upstream and downstream its coding region. SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≤ 0.05 or any missing values were also excluded. We further pruned the SNPs so that the absolute value of the pairwise Pearson correlation between any two SNPs was less than 0.8. If the number of SNPs were still larger than 50 after pruning, we would keep the top 50 SNPs with the highest correlations (in their absolute values) with the gene’s expression levels X. If q &gt; 1 (as in the MV-TWAS models), for each column i of X, we would take the top 50 SNPs with the highest correlations (in absolute values) with the column as Ii and use I=∪iIi as the SNPs for stage 1. Next, the data was normalized to have mean 0 and variance 1, and we used backward selection with AIC as the criterion to select SNPs. The final model would be a linear regression model given by the backward selection procedure. For each gene, the F-test was performed to assess the fit of the final model; if the p-value was ≥ 0.001, the gene was discarded (i.e. not used in the subsequent analysis). The choice of the tuning parameters (such as 0.8, 50 and 0.001 above) was somewhat arbitrary and largely followed a previous study (Xue et al., 2020) with some adjustments and the following rationale: highly correlated SNPs are not expected to help much to predict gene expression while causing the multi-collinearity problem, thus we pruned out highly correlated SNPs; given the relatively small sample size, to avoid large estimation errors (due to large variability), we decided to use a relatively simple linear model for effective prediction; and to satisfy the IV relevance assumption in 2SLS, we only chose cis-SNPs that were likely to be associated with a gene’s expression level as IVs.

2.4.2 The IGAP AD GWAS summary data

For the GWAS data in stage 2, we used the summary dataset released by The International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP) in 2013, which contained 54162 individuals (Li et al., 2002). The IGAP AD GWAS summary dataset was used to estimate the parameters in stage 2, namely θ^ and σ^ω2. To estimate θ^, notice that θ^=(X^2TX^2)−1X^2TY=(β^TZ2TZ2β^)−1β^TZ2TY.

Since we did not have individual level data for stage 2, we used Z1 to estimate Z2TZ2 and the summary statistics to estimate Z2TY. For σ^ω2, we have σ^ω2=‖Y−X^2β^‖22n2=1−2YTZ2β^θ^n2+‖Z2β^θ^‖2n2.

We substituted Z1 for Z2 in the last term, and used the summary statistics to estimate YTZ2 in the second term. To calculate the power, we assume that under the alternative hypothesis, the true θ is equal to the estimated one, i.e. θ=θ^.

2.4.3 The GTEx and UK Biobank data

To check our conclusions further, we used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset and the UK Biobank (UKB) data (GTEx Consortium, 2020; Sudlow et al., 2015). For our purposes, we used the GTEx v8 whole blood data with 19696 genes and n1 = 670 in stage 1. We regressed the gene expression on some covariates (including the first 5 genotype principal components, WGS sequencing platform, WGS library construction protocol, donor sex and PEER factors) provided in the dataset, and used the standardized residuals as the gene expression (i.e. x0) as in a previous TWAS (Lin et al., 2022). The rest of the data pre-processing and quality control procedures are the same as for the ADNI data.

For stage 2, we used the individual-level UKB data with the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) as the trait of interest. Only the data from the individuals of white British ancestry were used. Any individual who might be a close relative of another (kinship &gt; 0) or had any missing values for the SNPs selected in stage 1 was also removed. The sample sizes for most of the genes were about 200,000 - the exact sample size for a gene depended on the number of individuals removed due to missing data - and the total number of SNPs was around 800,000.

For the GTEx data, we obtained the estimated expression heritabilities and their 95% confidence intervals from (Wheeler et al., 2016). Therefore, we used the estimated expression heritabilities as the upper bounds of the stage 1 R2 to demonstrate the effects of increasing R2 on the power of TWAS under more realistic conditions. The genes with estimated heritability smaller than the R2 of the stage 1 fitted model were thus removed. In addition, if the lower bound of the 95% CI of the estimated heritability was 0, then the R2 of the fitted model was used as the lower bound because a gene with heritability 0 cannot be genetically associated with any trait.

The run time was roughly 4 hours for every 2000 genes.

3 Results

3.1 Effect of the Sample Size on TWAS power

In Figure 1, we show how power varies with the increasing sample size in stage 1. Except for a few genes for which the power does not increase at all, in general increasing the sample size leads to higher power. When the stage 1 sample size n1 is about 8000, i.e. a little over eleven times the original size, the power nearly reaches its maximum for most of the genes as if n1 = ∞. Overall, for most genes, there seems to be only diminishing power gains by increasing n1; that is, the power only increased barely or only slightly. This result suggests that the current practice of having a sample size of eQTL data ranging from a few hundreds to tens of thousands (Gamazon et al., 2015; Gusev et al., 2016) is not expected to be a severe limiting factor of the power of TWAS.

For comparison, in Figure 2, we show how power varies with the increasing sample size in stage 2. Note that the naive estimator, Var^S(θ^)=(X^2TX^2)−1σ^ω2, is inversely proportional to n2 since as n2 → ∞, (X^2TX^2)−1→0 while σ^ω2→σω2. As a result, increasing the stage 2 sample size will lower the naive variance estimate; at the same time, although the inflation factor, 1+n2n1θ^TΣ^vθ^/σ^ω2, will increase with n2, the final variance Varc^(θ^) of the estimated causal effect θ^ will decrease since θ^TΣ^vθ^/σ^ω2 is usually very small (≤ 0.03). It is clear that unless the original power is already close to 1, there will be notable power gains for almost every gene by increasing n2, unlike the situation for increasing n1.

3.2 Effect of R2 on the Power of TWAS

A more important factor determining TWAS power is the predictive power of gene expression by SNPs in stage 1, which can be measured by multiple coefficient of determination, R2. In Figure 3, we show that how TWAS power varies with R2; the genes are ordered by the power after increasing the observed R2 by 0.3. We can see that even 0.1 increase in R2 boosts the power by a large margin; a 0.3 increase of R2 leads to high power for most of the genes. Note that for some genes, there is little power gain because their original R2’s are already large (close to 0.95), leaving barely any room to increase their R2’s (since R2 cannot be larger than 1 and we capped any increased R2 at 0.95); in addition, the power of TWAS depends on not only the R2 in stage 1, but other parameters in stage 2 such as the sample size, prediction accuracy of the stage 2 model, and the size and variance of the estimated causal effect, θ^. On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that, by definition, the true R2 for any gene is biologically upper bounded by its heritability. In other words, if a gene’s true R2 is small, regardless of the sample size n1, any analysis method will always be relatively low powered to detect its association with a trait in stage 2.

3.3 Power analysis for TWAS-LQ and MV-TWAS

Figure 4 compares the power for different tests in MV-TWAS and TWAS-LQ with that in UV-TWAS. It can be seen that, in general, MV-TWAS/TWAS-LQ may substantially increase or decrease the power as compared to the standard (linear) UV-TWAS denoted as UV-L. For example, when the underlying relationship between the gene expression and the trait can be approximated by a quadratic function (when TWAS-Q or UV-Q gives a small p-value), including a quadratic term of the gene expression in TWAS-LQ will greatly increase the power, as indicated by panel C in Figure 4. However, in the case where the quadratic term is not relevant/significant, e.g. the underlying relationship is approximately linear, UV-L outperforms TWAS-LQ. We observe a similar result for the MV-TWAS model. When the expression of the neighbor gene nearest to the target gene has a great contribution to the trait, MV-TWAS outperforms UV-TWAS; otherwise, we lose power by including it in the model.

As an example, consider gene HLA-DRB5 and its nearest neighbor gene HLA-DRB1 in Figure 4C. When considered separately, i.e applying the UV-L model to each of the two genes,

HLA-DRB5 is significantly associated with AD with a p-value of 4.4e–6 that can be detected with power 0.52, while HLA-DRB1 has a p-value of 3e–5 and power 0.28. The Pearson’s correlation between the predicted expressions of the two genes is 0.21. Given the small p-value of the neighbor gene and the low correlation between their predicted expressions, incorporating the neighbor gene into the MV-TWAS model boosts the power from 0.52 to 0.83. On the other hand, gene GLT8D2 has a p-value of 2.02e–10 and power 0.7 under the UV-L model. However, since its nearest gene, TDG, has a much larger p-value of 0.64, including it in the MV-TWAS model decreases the power to 0.03. Interestingly, there is rarely any notable power decrease when the high correlation between a target gene and its neighbor gene is the only reason. In fact, if both genes have p-values less than or equal to 0.01 under the UV-L model, the correlation between their predicted expressions is less than 0.3 in absolute values except for gene RNASE3, for which the correlation is 0.87. Under the UV-L model, RNASE3 and its neighboring gene RNASE2 have p-values of 5.6e–3 and 8.5e–4, respectively, and corresponding power of 0.04 and 0.11; in contrast, the power for their MV-TWAS model is 0.09, an increase for RNASE3 but a decrease for RNASE2. The results suggest that for MV-TWAS, the relevance of the genes to the trait has a larger impact on the power than their correlation.

Tables 1 and 2 list the genes for which there are relatively larger improvements of power by TWAS-LQ and MV-TWAS over that of UV-TWAS. The p-values, the power, and the power gained by using TWAS-LQ/MV-TWAS are also listed. As detailed in the Discussion section, the relevance of these genes to AD has been discussed in the literature.

3.4 Results for the GTEx and UKB data

We focused on analyzing the effects of sample sizes and R2 with the GTEx and UKB data, and reached the same conclusions as before. We observed power increases as the stage 1 sample size was multiplied by a factor of 2, 5, 10, and 50 respectively (Figure 5). Note that the power increased much less from ”5 x” to ”10 x” than from ”1 x” to ”2 x” or from ”2 x” to ”5 x,” the same effect on diminishing power gains discussed in Section 3.1. Recall that the stage 1 sample size n1 was 670, and the stage 2 sample sizes n2 were around 200,000. Due to the large difference in the sample sizes, we needed to increase n1 by a factor of no more than 50 for the power to be almost equal to its maximum as if n1 = ∞. The ratio n1/n2 at which the power nearly attained the maximum was similar for both dataset - roughly 1/6 or 1/7.

The case for n2 was the same as for the ADNI/IGAP data; see Figure 6. Regardless of the ratio n1/n2, increasing n2 always resulted in a notable power gain unless the power was close to 1, in contrast to diminishing power gains of increasing n1.

The availability of the estimated expression heritability allowed for a more realistic expectation of the upper bound of the R2 in stage 1 (Wheeler et al., 2016), as compared to arbitrarily increasing R2 as done for the ADNI data. In Figure 7 A, we plotted the power calculated with the estimated heritability and the 95% CI bounds against the power calculated with the actual R2 of the fitted model. Panel B compares the estimated heritability to the R2 of the fitted model. For most genes, their fitted R2 values were quite close to their heritability estimates, leading to their similar power curves. Similar to that observed for the ADNI data, a larger R2 would always result in a gain in power; how much a larger R2 would improve the power was also dependent on other factors as discussed in Section 3.2.

4 Discussion

In summary, we have studied the effects of the sample size and R2 (or more generally, gene expression heritability) in stage 1 on the power of the standard/univariate TWAS, and the potential power gains/losses of multivariate TWAS. The small sample size of the eQTL data in TWAS may raise concerns on its possibly diminishing the power of TWAS by inflating the variance of the causal estimate θ^ in stage 2. We have shown that, as expected, increasing the stage 1 sample size would increase the power, but, perhaps surprisingly, only to a limited extent: a sample size n1 of eight thousands, only about 1/7 of the stage 2 sample size, seemed to nearly reach the power upper bound (when n1 = ∞) for almost all the genes in our ADNI/IGAP real data example. This result is surprising because this sample size n1 in stage 1 is still much smaller than n2 in stage 2. On the other hand, the effect of the sample size n2 in stage 2 appears to be of much higher impact. The same conclusions on the differing effects of the sample sizes in the two stages in TWAS were reached in the application to the GTEx and UKB data. These results are in agreement with a recent empirical study using other omic and GWAS data (Baranger et al., 2022): using smaller GWAS data in stage 2 may dramatically hinder any new discovery at the end for TWAS.

The case for R2, however, is more complicated than that for the sample size. Whether and how much the power would increase as a result of a larger R2 depended on 1) the original (or baseline) R2, 2) the estimated variance of the causal effect, and 3) the original power. Generally, if the original power and original R2 were small, and the estimated variance was large, then one would benefit more from a larger R2 than otherwise. However, it is noted that the R2 for any gene is upper bounded by the heiritability of its expression, so it cannot really be manipulated for real data to increase power.

The multivariate TWAS analysis suggested that compared to the standard/univariate TWAS model, including higher order terms or information from other genes could greatly increase the power (or decrease the power), at least under some realistic configurations (since the unknown true parameters are estimated from the real data) as we demonstrated with the real data. Interestingly, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, many of the genes with substantial power gains by TWAS-LQ and MV-TWAS over that of the standard UV-TWAS are related to AD as discussed in the literature. For example, the genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex have been considered risk factors of late-onsite AD (Mansouri et al., 2015; Steele et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2020). APOC1 is another widely known gene, related to APOE, that affects the risk of AD (Q. Zhou et al., 2014; X. Zhou et al., 2019). On the other hand, it has been proposed that BIN1 mediates the risk of AD (Chapuis et al., 2013). The results justified the use of MV-TWAS models to identify additional genes that could be missed by UV-TWAS, so researchers may consider incorporating them into their studies.

Although power analysis for TWAS methods has gained some attention in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, none of the studies addressed the issues discussed in this paper. For example, a recent study inspected the effects of prediction accuracy of the stage 1 model on the TWAS power (Cao et al., 2021). However, they did not directly examine effect of R2 on the power, but instead focused on the influence of replacing predicted gene expression with observed gene expression. Other studies either compared TWAS methods with GWAS, or focused on closely related Mendelian randomization analyses (L. Deng et al., 2020; Veturi and Ritchie, 2018). In particular, these studies assumed a univariate, linear stage 2 model and conducted simulations, instead of using real data to generate more realistic parameters for analysis. Importantly, we expect that the current study will be useful in offering a general approach to sample size/power calculations for both univariate and multivariate TWAS.

There are a few limitations of this study. First, we did not account for potential horizontal pleiotropy where genetic variants contribute to both gene expression levels and traits directly, leading to a biased causal estimate if not suitably accounted (Y. Deng and Pan, 2021; Lin et al., 2022). Second, one could consider non-linear or non-parametric models like random forest (Breiman, 2001), gradient boosting machines (Friedman, 2001), or other machine learning methods (Okoro et al., 2021) to boost the prediction accuracy in stage 1, to which the analysis presented here no longer applies because of our adopted linear models in stage 1. Third, perhaps most importantly, some specific results (e.g. required n1 or the ratio of n1/n2) may change if different eQTL and GWAS data are considered, though we do not expect that our general conclusions (as discussed in the first three paragraphs in this section) will change dramatically.
