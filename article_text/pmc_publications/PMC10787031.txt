Introduction:

Serial position effects in verbal memory are associated with in vivo fluid biomarkers and neuropathological outcomes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To extend the biomarker literature, associations between serial position scores and post-mortem levels of brain phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were examined, in the context of Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangle progression.

Method:

Participants were 1091 community-dwelling adults (Mage = 80.2, 68.9% female) from the Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project who were non-demented at enrollment and followed for a mean of 9.2 years until death. The CERAD Word List Memory test administered at baseline and within one year of death was used to calculate serial position (primacy, recency) and total recall scores. Proteomic analyses quantified p-tau 217 and 202 from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples. Linear regressions assessed associations between cognitive scores and p-tau with Braak stage as a moderator.

Results:

Cognitive status proximal to death indicated 34.7% were unimpaired, 26.2% met criteria for MCI, and 39.0% for dementia. Better baseline primacy recall, but not recency recall, was associated with lower p-tau 217 levels across Braak stages. Delayed recall showed a similar pattern as primacy. There was no main effect of immediate recall, but an interaction with Braak stages indicated a negative association with p-tau 217 level only in Braak V-VI. Within one year of death, there were no main effects for any cognitive scores; however, recency, immediate and delayed recall scores interacted with Braak stage showing better recall was associated with lower p-tau 217 only in Braak V-VI. No associations were observed with p-tau 202.

Conclusions:

Primacy recall measured in non-demented adults may be sensitive to emergent tau phosphorylation that occurs in the earliest stages of AD. Serial position scores may complement the routinely used delayed recall score and p-tau biomarkers to detect preclinical AD.

pmcIntroduction

The accumulation of neurofibrillary plaques and tangles that are hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begins years before the emergence of memory problems associated with dementia (Jack et al., 2010). By the time neuropsychological impairment is detected upon formal assessment, the disease process is already quite advanced and interventions at this juncture are of limited clinical utility. Intervening in the putative preclinical stage, before the emergence of obvious cognitive impairment, may be necessary for pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options to have greater impact on halting or slowing disease progression and cognitive decline (Sperling et al., 2014). While significant advances have been made in the early detection of AD pathology using PET imaging of beta amyloid and tau (Garibotto et al., 2021), the ability to detect more subtle cognitive changes that precede frank impairment remains challenging.

Dementia is on a continuum from normality to subtle and then mild cognitive impairment to dementia (Jack et al., 2018). There is now a growing appreciation for the role of process scores in identifying subtle cognitive difficulties. These subtle difficulties have been defined as cognitive inefficiencies that are evident from process scores on memory tests, such as learning slope, interference, and intrusion errors, despite an overall normal neuropsychological profile as indicated by routine total recall and composite cognitive scores (Thomas et al., 2018). Among individuals who meet the criteria for objective subtle cognitive difficulties or decline, there is evidence for a greater burden of white matter hyperintensities (Calcetas et al., 2022) and tau PET levels (Thomas et al., 2022), faster amyloid accumulation and entorhinal cortical thinning (Thomas et al., 2020), and a steeper increase in phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels over time (Thomas et al., 2021). Novel experimental memory tasks that are designed to specifically probe and tax hippocampal functioning have also demonstrated utility in detecting subtle variation in cognitive functioning that correlates with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau 181 (Trelle et al., 2021) and amyloid load (Loewenstein et al., 2016) in cognitively unimpaired older adults.

Serial position effects in verbal memory are process scores that have also received a fair amount of attention more recently as sensitive markers of hippocampal dysfunction that occurs early in the course of AD (Weitzner &amp; Calamia, 2020). Serial position effects refer to the observation that in healthy individuals there is tendency to better recall words from the beginning (the primacy effect) and end (the recency effect) of a list, with fewer words recalled in the middle position (Murdock Jr., 1962). Primacy recall is considered to be a hippocampal dependent process that engages long-term memory stores, and is supported by studies showing a link between primacy performance and hippocampal lesions (Hermann et al., 1996), hippocampal volume (Bruno et al., 2015), and differential fMRI activation patterns (Talmi et al., 2005). Given that AD is associated with early pathological changes in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (Braak &amp; Del Tredici, 2015), the conceptualization of primacy recall as hippocampal-dependent is further supported by clinical evidence that shows an increasingly poorer primacy effect among persons who (1) are at high risk for AD (La Rue et al., 2008), (2) have mild cognitive impairment (MCI; Cunha et al., 2012; Howieson et al., 2011); and (3) have Alzheimer’s dementia (Bayley et al., 2000; Cunha et al., 2012; Moser et al., 2014). Moreover, primacy recall derived from the delayed word-list trial has shown to be a more sensitive predictor of conversion to MCI compared to delayed recall (Talamonti et al., 2019).

In contrast, recency recall is considered to be a fronto-parietal dependent process that relies on short-term memory stores (Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968; Malmberg et al., 2019) and is supported by studies that have shown greater fMRI activation of the intraparietal lobe during recency recall (Talmi et al., 2005) and disruption of the recency effect with application of transcranial magnetic stimulation to this same region (Innocenti et al., 2013). There is some clinical evidence to suggest that the recency effect is exaggerated in MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia due to an overreliance on short-term memory to compensate for impairment in long-term memory functioning (Bruno et al., 2016; Foldi et al., 2003). Based on this observation, novel serial position-derived scores, such as the primacy ratio and the recency ratio have been shown to be particularly sensitive to conversion to MCI (Bruno et al., 2018) and overall amyloid burden in non-demented older adults (Bruno et al., 2021).

With recent advances in molecular imaging and fluid biomarker detection, there is a need to determine whether serial position scores, and their novel derivatives, track with these contemporary in vivo markers of disease state and progression. The ATN framework lays out the standards for classifying biomarkers and currently defines three groups by pathological process including (1) beta amyloid deposition; (2) pathologic tau; and (3) neurodegeneration (Jack et al., 2018). Since tau is considered to be among the primary drivers of early cognitive difficulties associated with AD (Brier et al., 2016), a focus on the link between serial position scores and pathological tau biomarkers is warranted. The most current in vivo biomarker methods to assess pathologic tau include the use of PET tau tracers, CSF assays, and more recently, plasma assays though this latter method is not yet established for use within routine clinical practice (Garibotto et al., 2021). One of the most well-established tau biomarkers for AD is p-tau at threonine 181 (Blennow &amp; Zetterberg, 2018; Janelidze et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021), but more recent work suggests that p-tau 217 may have even greater power in discriminating AD from other dementias (Barthélemy, Bateman, et al., 2020; Janelidze, Stomrud, et al., 2020; Palmqvist et al., 2021) and between MCI and cognitively unimpaired individuals (Mielke et al., 2022). Recent work has linked the recency ratio with elevated levels of CSF p-tau in a mixed sample of older adults with and without dementia (Bruno et al., 2023), but more work on how serial position scores track with specific tau biomarkers across disease stages is needed to validate these scores as early cognitive markers of AD.

The current study represents an extension of ongoing work on serial position scores in the Rush University Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (Bennett et al., 2018). We previously reported that primacy recall, but not recency recall, was particularly sensitive to the overall burden of AD and other hippocampal-related pathologies (Gicas et al., 2020) and exhibited selective decline in early Braak stages (Gicas et al., 2022), highlighting primacy recall as a process score that may be considered a cognitive marker of preclinical AD. Here, we link post-mortem brain levels of p-tau with primacy and recency scores measured distally (at baseline) and proximally (within one year) to death in the ROSMAP cohorts. Level of p-tau 217 was selected as the primary outcome because it is considered a putative marker of preclinical AD given evidence that plasma levels of 217 are detectable prior to PET tau (Janelidze et al., 2021) and that it may be one of the earliest sites of phosphorylation that begins at least two decades prior to the emergence of neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline (Barthélemy, Li, et al., 2020). Level of p-tau serine 202 was selected as a primary outcome for comparison because, while it has also been identified as a site that undergoes phosphorylation early in the sequence of tau-related changes in pre-tangle neurons (Luna-Muñoz et al., 2007), levels of CSF p-tau 202 do not appear to change with disease progression or track with global cognitive changes over time (Barthélemy, Li, et al., 2020). An additional objective was to examine whether the associations between serial position scores and brain p-tau levels vary across Braak stages since it has been suggested that site-specific phosphorylation occurs differentially in early and later Braak stages (Neddens et al., 2018). Since primacy recall has demonstrated sensitivity to early AD-related brain changes, it was hypothesized that better primacy recall, but not recency recall, measured distally (years before death) would be associated with lower levels of post-mortem brain p-tau 217. Since recency recall tends to be relatively preserved in AD (Weitzner &amp; Calamia, 2020) and may not be substantially impacted until neurofibrillary tangle progression affects the fronto-parietal regions that subserve recency recall (Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968; Malmberg et al., 2019), we predicted that recency recall measured proximal to death would be most sensitive to brain p-tau 217 levels. Specifically, better recency recall would be associated with lower p-tau 217, but only in more advanced Braak stages when neurofibrillary tangles have accumulated in the frontal and parietal regions. No associations between serial position scores and levels of p-tau 202 were predicted. For comparison purposes, associations between more conventional total recall scores (immediate, delayed) and p-tau levels were examined, and all models were re-run with neurofibrillary tangle density as a supplementary outcome given that tangles are known to track closely with cognitive status (Nelson et al., 2012).

Materials and Methods

Participants

Data were used from two ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies of older adults conducted through the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (Bennett et al., 2018). The Religious Orders Study (ROS) began in 1994 and enrolled priests, brothers, and nuns recruited from multiple locations across the United States, while the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) began in 1997 and enrolled community-dwelling adults in Northeastern Illinois recruited from churches, retirement homes, and social service agencies. To be eligible for inclusion in ROS or MAP, participants must consent to annual evaluations and to organ donation at death by signing an Anatomical Gift Act. All participants provided signed consent to share their data in a repository. ROS and MAP were approved by an Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center.

As of May 2017, there were a total of 1226 participants from ROSMAP who had died, underwent autopsy, and had available proteomic data that was generated in waves starting in April 2014. We excluded 128 participants who met criteria for dementia at baseline and 7 participants who did not have a complete baseline CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD) Word List Memory test resulting in a final analytic sample of 1091 for the current study. Participants were 68.9% female (n = 752), 97.9% White (n = 1068), had a mean age of 80.2 years (SD = 6.9) at study enrollment, a mean of 16.2 years of education (SD = 3.6), and had a mean interval of 9.2 years (SD = 5.0) between study enrollment and death. On average, participants were 89.4 years old at death (SD = 6.5). A total of 24.1% (n = 263) participants were APOE ε4 positive.

Cognitive Evaluations

Participants underwent annual neuropsychological evaluations that entailed standardized clinical tests of working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory, visuospatial functioning, and perceptual speed (Wilson et al., 2019). For the purpose of the current study, data from the CERAD Word List Memory test (Morris et al., 1989) was used from the baseline assessment and from the last valid assessment that occurred within one year of death. Serial position scores were computed from the Word List Memory test by summing the number of correctly recalled words in a given region (primacy = first three list words; recency = last three list words) across all three trials and dividing this by the total number of words in that region (e.g., 3 per trial X 3 trials = 9 total), reflecting the proportion of primacy or recency words recalled, ranging from 0 to 1 (Gicas et al., 2022; Moser et al., 2014). The immediate recall total score was derived by summing the number of correctly recalled words across the three trials, ranging from 0 to 30, whereas the delayed recall total score was defined as the number of list words freely recalled on the delay trial, ranging from 0 to 10.

Clinical diagnoses for the current study were classified as either (1) unimpaired; (2) mild cognitive impairment; or (3) dementia. Diagnoses at baseline and each year were made using data from the neuropsychological assessment, clinical judgment from a blinded neuropsychologist, and clinical classification by a neurologist, geriatrician, or geriatric nurse practitioner as reported (Bennett et al., 2002; Bennett, Schneider, Aggarwal, et al., 2006; Bennett, Schneider, Arvanitakis, et al., 2006). Clinical diagnosis proximal to death was established by a neurologist using select information but blinded to post-mortem status. Ambiguous cases underwent further adjudication.

Post-Mortem Evaluations

Neuropathological.

All participants who died underwent a brain autopsy with full details reported in prior published work (Bennett, Schneider, Arvanitakis, et al., 2006). To briefly summarize, the brainstem and cerebellum were first removed followed by fixing one hemisphere in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 to 21 days before cutting it into 1cm coronal slices. The other hemisphere was cut into 1cm coronal slices and immediately frozen. A neuropathological evaluation was performed by a neuropathologist blinded to all clinical information. Microscopic evaluation was performed using 6 μm sections of region-specific tissue that was embedded in paraffin and then sliced. Neurofibrillary tangles were visualized using Bielschowsky silver stain, and the distribution and severity were assessed across five regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, entorhinal, hippocampus) to classify Braak stage from 0 to VI according to the original staging scheme (Braak, 2006). For analytic purposes of the current study, a 3-level variable was derived that grouped Braak stages as 0-II, III-IV, and V-VI. A quantitative measure of neurofibrillary tangle density was derived from a count of tangles in the middle frontal cortex. This regional count was selected to parallel the p-tau measures derived from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue samples. Apolipoprotein (APOE) genotyping was determined using post-mortem brain tissue or blood from DNA samples and coded as a dichotomous variable where APOE ε4 positive status was classified as having any of the following: ε2/4, ε3/4 or ε4/4.

Additional age-related neuropathologies were measured and included for descriptive purposes in the current study. Immunocytochemistry and image analyses were used to quantify several pathologies, including amyloid beta, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, TDP-43 (transactive response DNA-binding protein 43), and Lewy bodies. Global beta-amyloid was calculated by averaging the percentage of cortex occupied by amyloid beta in eight regions (angular gyrus, anterior cingulate, calcarine, entorhinal, hippocampus, inferior temporal, middle frontal, superior frontal). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy was quantified in four regions (calcarine, midfrontal, midtemporal, parietal) according to the protocol by Love and colleagues (2014). TDP-43 inclusions were classified across 4 stages (1 = none; 2 = amygdala; 3 = amygdala and limbic; 4 = amygdala, limbic, and neocortical) according to the staging scheme by Nag and colleagues (2018), and were collapsed across stages 2–4 for reporting purposes in the current study. Bielschowsky stain was used to quantify neuritic plaques averaged across five regions (entorhinal, hippocampus, inferior parietal, midfrontal, midtemporal). The presence of hippocampal sclerosis was indicated where there was evidence of severe neuronal loss and gliosis in CA1 or the subiculum in sections of the midhippocampus (Nag et al., 2015). Cerebral atherosclerosis was evaluated by visual inspection of the Circle of Willis and graded based on the number and extent of arteries involved (Arvanitakis et al., 2017). Arteriosclerosis was evaluated by observed changes to small vessels in the anterior basal ganglia (Buchman et al., 2011). The presence of one or more cerebral infarcts (gross chronic and microinfarcts) were visually identified by a blinded neuropathologist (Arvanitakis et al., 2011).

Proteomics.

Targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) proteomics was performed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to identify tau peptides using post-mortem tissue samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex approximating Brodmann’s area (BA) 9/46, and frozen at −80C. Full details of the SRM protocol are reported elsewhere (Kapasi et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2018). Five different tau protein phosphorylation sites were selected for analysis analogous to the binding domains for antibodies AT8 (S202), AT100 (T217), 12E8 (S262), 77G7 (S305) and PHF-1 (S404). Ten synthetic heavy peptides were purchased from New England Peptide (Gardner, MA), representing 5 phosphorylated and 5 unmodified pairings. Endogenous tryptic peptides were prepared from each tissue sample and mixed with the synthetic peptides for analysis. Levels of the endogenous phosphorylated and unmodified peptides were each log2 transformed and median centred. For the current study, p-tau peptides of interest (T217, S202) were adjusted by subtracting the value of the unmodified peptide from the phosphopeptide to control for the abundance of the tau protein itself.

Statistical Analysis

All continuous variables were examined for normality and outliers via visual inspection of histograms. Pearson correlations were used to examine associations between the p-tau variables, as well as between the cognitive variables at baseline and the last valid scores within 1 year of death. A series of linear regression analyses was run to examine how serial position scores and total recall scores were associated with post-mortem brain p-tau levels, with each adjusted p-tau variable entered as a separate outcome. Immediate and delayed recall scores were entered as predictors in separate models due to a high correlation between these two variables and with the derivative serial position scores. Models were run for baseline cognitive scores and then repeated for cognitive scores obtained within 1 year of death. The 3-level Braak staging variable was included as a covariate and additionally examined as a moderator in each model to determine if associations between cognition and brain p-tau differed by disease stage. Braak stage X cognitive score interaction terms were analyzed separately and all terms significant at p &lt; .05 were retained for inclusion in the final reported models. Continuous variables included in the interaction terms were mean centered. For all significant interaction terms, simple slopes were calculated to determine whether the association between a cognitive predictor and p-tau level was statistically significant (i.e., slope is different than zero) within a given Braak stage. Additional covariates included age (at baseline or death), sex, years of education, APOE ε4 status, and time to death (in years, for baseline models only).

Supplementary analyses were performed by re-running the above regression models with neurofibrillary tangle density as the outcome variable. A square root transformation was applied to tangle density to correct a positive skew. A sensitivity analysis was also run to examine whether the results for the baseline models are similar between the full baseline sample (N = 1091) versus the restricted sample (N = 656) of participants who had completed cognitive evaluations at both baseline and within 1 year of death. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) values are reported for all regression models to facilitate goodness-of-fit comparisons across models, with lower values indicating a better model fit. Model assumptions were evaluated by examining plots for evidence of normality and heteroscedasticity of residuals. All analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 2020).

Results

Of the 1091 participants at baseline, 70.0% (n = 764) of participants were cognitively unimpaired and 30.0% (n = 327) met criteria for MCI. Proximal to death, 34.7% (n = 379) were unimpaired, 26.2% (n = 286) met criteria for MCI, and 39.0% (n = 426) met criteria for dementia. Based on the neuropathological evaluation, 16.7% (n = 182) were classified as Braak stage 0-II, 58.8% (n = 642) as Braak stage III-IV, and 25.0% (n = 273) as Braak stage V-VI. Table 1 summarizes the frequencies of different age-related neuropathologies that are present in this sample. Missing data for APOE ε4 status was identified for nine participants yielding a final sample size of 1082 participants with complete data for the baseline analyses. An additional 426 participants did not have available cognitive data within one year of death, yielding a final sample size of 656 for analyses using the cognitive scores proximal to death as the predictors. For descriptive purposes, Pearson correlations between cognitive measures (baseline and proximal to death) and brain p-tau levels are reported in Table 2. Briefly, there was a small positive correlation between primacy and recency recall at baseline (r = .08, p = .005) and a stronger correlation between these variables when measured within 1 year of death (r = .39, p &lt; .001). The primary outcome variables, p-tau 217 and 202, also exhibited a large positive correlation (r = .63, p &lt; .001).

Associations Between Baseline Cognitive Scores and P-Tau

Results of the linear regression models using baseline cognitive scores are fully described in Table 3 for serial position scores, and Tables 4 and 5 for total recall scores. To summarize the main findings from the model with p-tau 217 as the outcome, as hypothesized, better primacy recall was associated with lower levels of p-tau (b = −.261, p = .035) and this was not moderated by Braak stage. Recency recall was not associated with p-tau 217 (b = .509, p = .138). While a significant interaction between recency recall and Braak stage III-IV (compared to 0-II) was observed (b = −.802, p = .037), upon closer inspection of the simple slopes, none of the within-stage associations between recency recall and p-tau were statistically significant (see supplementary Table S1 for all simple slopes tested). In models examining total recall scores as the predictors of p-tau 217, there was no main effect of immediate recall on p-tau 217 level, but there was a significant interaction with Braak stage V-VI (compared to 0-II; b = −.041, p = .032). Further assessment of the simple slopes indicated that better immediate recall was associated with lower levels of p-tau only in Braak stage V-VI (b = −.029, p = .018; see Figure 1). In contrast, better delayed recall was associated with lower levels of p-tau (b = −.032, p = .007) and this did not interact with Braak stage. When level of p-tau 202 was considered as the outcome in the linear regression models, none of the baseline cognitive measures were significantly associated with it, nor were there any interactions with Braak stages.

Supplementary analyses with neurofibrillary tangle density as the outcome were run for comparison purposes and yielded a slightly different pattern of results (see Supplemental Tables S2–S4 for results). Briefly, neither baseline primacy nor recency recall had an overall effect on neurofibrillary tangle density, however primacy recall interacted with Braak stage whereby better recall was associated with lower tangle density in Braak stages V-VI only. Total immediate and delayed recall scores both had negative associations with neurofibrillary tangle density, and these associations were not moderated by Braak stage.

Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine associations between baseline cognitive scores and p-tau 217 in the restricted sample of 656 participants who also had available cognitive data within 1 year of death. We found a nearly identical pattern of results with the exception of no main effect for baseline primacy scores on p-tau 217 (b = −.230, p = .165), but an interaction with Braak stage was present indicating a negative association within Braak stages V-VI only (b = −1.047, p = .047). Moreover, the pattern of select effects in Braak stage V-VI previously observed for immediate recall (b = −.050, p = .050) and the overall main effect for delayed recall (b = −.032, p = .045) still held but were notably weaker. A post-hoc chi-square test revealed that there was a significantly higher proportion of persons with dementia among those who had available cognitive data (47.4%) versus those who did not (33.8%) within 1 year of death (X2 = 20.13, p &lt; .001). This key clinical difference, as a well as a sample size difference, may help to explain why the effects were somewhat weaker in the restricted sample.

Associations Between Cognitive Scores Within 1 Year of Death and P-Tau

Results of the linear regression models using cognitive scores measured within one year of death are fully described in Table 3 for serial position scores, Tables 4 and 5 for total recall scores, and supplementary Table S1 for simple slopes. For the serial position score model with level of p-tau 217 as the outcome, neither primacy recall (b = −.098, p = .557) nor recency recall (b = .185, p = .315) were associated with p-tau 217 level. However, as predicted, recency recall interacted with Braak stage V-VI (compared to 0-II; b = −.930, p = .028) whereby better recency recall was associated with lower p-tau levels only in Braak V-VI (b = −.745, p = .010; see Figure 2). Likewise, there were no main effects for immediate recall (b = .012, p = .832) or delayed recall (b = −.010, p = .717), however, associations between total recall scores and p-tau 217 were moderated by Braak stages. Immediate recall interacted with Braak stage V-VI (compared to 0-II; b = −.261, p = .002; see Figure 3), with simple slope tests indicating better recall was associated with lower p-tau 217 only in Braak stages V-VI (b = −.053, p &lt;.0001). Delayed recall showed the same pattern whereby there was an interaction with Braak stages V-VI (compared to 0-II; b = −.093, p = .044) and simple slopes showed a negative association between delayed recall and p-tau 217 only in Braak stages V-VI (b = −.103, p = .007; see Figure 4). No associations were observed between any of the cognitive measures proximal to death and levels of p-tau 202, nor were there any interactions with Braak stages.

Supplementary analyses with neurofibrillary tangle density as the outcome yielded nearly identical results as the p-tau 217 models; recency, immediate, and delayed recall measured proximal to death did not have an overall effect on neurofibrillary tangles but better recall on these measures was associated with lower tangle density selectively in Braak stages V-VI. Similarly, better primacy recall was only associated with lower tangle density in Braak stages V-VI, though this was not observed in the p-tau models. Full model results are reported in Supplemental Tables S2–S4.

Discussion

The findings of this study extend existing literature on tau biomarkers in AD by showing a link between serial position scores in verbal memory and levels of post-mortem brain p-tau within a large sample comprised of two longitudinal clinical-pathological cohorts of community-dwelling adults who were non-demented at study enrollment. As predicted, we found evidence that better primacy recall, but not recency recall, measured on average 9 years before death, was associated with lower levels of brain p-tau 217. Also consistent with our hypotheses was the finding that, while there was no overall effect for recency recall measured proximal to death, Braak stage moderated the association whereby better recency recall was associated with lower levels of p-tau 217 only in more advanced Braak stages. There were no associations between any of the memory measures and p-tau 202, consistent with previous research (Barthélemy, Li, et al., 2020). Similarly, the routinely used total recall scores measured distally and proximally (within 1 year) to death also did not show overall associations with p-tau 217, but interactions with Braak stages revealed select negative associations in advanced Braak stages only, with the exception of delayed recall at baseline which was negatively associated with p-tau 217 levels across all Braak stages. Results were largely similar when neurofibrillary tangle density was used as a supplementary outcome, however subtle differences suggested that baseline primacy recall was less sensitive to tangle outcomes and immediate recall was more sensitive to tangle outcomes compared to p-tau 217.

In keeping with our initial hypothesis, we found an association between better primacy recall at baseline and post-mortem levels of brain p-tau 217, in the absence of overall effects for baseline measures of recency recall or total immediate recall. This is consistent with our previous findings from the MAP cohort that primacy recall was selectively associated with hippocampal-related pathology and better discriminated between persons with MCI and no cognitive impairment (Gicas et al., 2020). Our results are also supported by emerging studies showing higher levels of p-tau 217 predict future memory problems in cognitively unimpaired persons with autosomal dominant AD (Aguillon et al., 2022), and that level of, and longitudinal change in, p-tau 217 is associated with greater global cognitive decline in early AD (Ashton et al., 2022; Mielke et al., 2022). When multiple biomarkers have been considered together, plasma p-tau 217 combined with a cognitive composite score were the strongest predictors of progression from MCI to dementia (Pichet Binette et al., 2022). In our study, it was also interesting to find that primacy recall measured within one year of death was not associated with p-tau 217 levels. It is possible that primacy recall may not track well with tau biomarkers in more advanced disease stages when the medial temporal region has been overwhelmed with AD pathology and as a result primacy recall is severely impaired. This interpretation is also consistent with previous reports that the rate of p-tau 217 change seems to slow or decrease with disease progression (Barthélemy, Li, et al., 2020; Fagan et al., 2014; McDade et al., 2018), suggesting that primacy recall may only be sensitive to p-tau 217 when it is more dynamic in the very early stages of the protracted trajectory of AD.

Also, in keeping with our initial hypothesis, better recency recall was associated with lower levels of p-tau 217 only in more advanced Braak stages (V-VI) and when measured proximal to death, in the absence of an overall effect. This remains consistent with reports that recency recall generally remains preserved in earlier stages of AD and may even transiently increase as a result of compensatory effects (Bruno et al., 2016; Weitzner &amp; Calamia, 2020). Indeed, we previously reported evidence for an initial increase in recency recall in a sub-sample of ROSMAP when examining longitudinal change in serial position scores in early Braak stages (Gicas et al., 2022). In the current study there was some variation in the associations of baseline recency recall and p-tau 217 levels across the Braak stages, but there were no meaningful relationships detected within stages, which points to the relative insensitivity of recency recall to preclinical AD and the need to examine the differential effects of serial position scores individually rather than combining them into a single total recall score.

For comparison purposes, this study also examined the immediate and delayed total recall scores given that these are routinely used in clinical contexts. The pattern of findings was largely similar to what was observed for recency recall whereby there were no main effects but better immediate recall, measured distally and proximally to death, was selectively associated with lower brain p-tau 217 in advanced Braak stages only. This suggests that immediate recall scores may also be relatively insensitive to early stages of disease and likely only shows a relationship with p-tau levels once neurofibrillary tangles begin rapidly accumulating in the several years prior to detection of clinical cognitive impairment (Barthélemy, Li, et al., 2020).

Interestingly, while delayed recall only associated with p-tau 217 in later Braak stages when assessed proximal death, delayed recall at baseline remained a strong predictor of post-mortem p-tau 217 levels across all Braak stages and of similar magnitude to the effect observed for primacy recall. This is not surprising since delayed recall has been well-researched as a key cognitive marker of early AD (Cerami et al., 2017), and computational biomarker modelling has identified dynamic changes in delayed recall that appear to precede ATN biomarkers (Jedynak et al., 2012). Importantly, the effects for delayed recall and primacy recall at baseline were very comparable, though we were precluded from doing a head-to-head comparison by including these predictors in the same model due to concerns of multicollinearity (scores were strongly correlated at r = .63). A comparison of model fit indices yielded mixed results whereby AIC values indicated a better fit for the delayed recall versus the serial position score models (−353.49 vs. −448.74), but BIC values indicated a worse fit for the delayed recall versus serial position score models (2774.65 vs. 2688.67). In this community-dwelling sample of older adults, there is not strong evidence that primacy performance measured in the putative preclinical stage of AD offers a unique advantage in predicting p-tau 217 levels as compared to delayed recall, though it might still be considered as a complementary cognitive marker that can help shed light on the integrity of underlying dissociable brain systems (i.e., temporal versus frontal circuitry). This is especially evident given a clear pattern of differential associations between each of the serial position scores and p-tau 217 levels. Other studies that have examined novel serial position-derived scores in verbal memory, however, have shown that when compared head-to-head the primacy and recency ratios outperform delayed recall scores in predicting CSF tau and amyloid biomarkers (Bruno et al., 2019, 2021, 2023). Therefore, serial position ratio scores may be the more sensitive preclinical predictors of neuropathologies and dementia, and should be examined in future studies.

There are some limitations to note for this study. First, it is acknowledged that this sample is comprised of mostly White and highly educated older adults and that our findings need to be replicated in more sociodemographically and clinically diverse cohorts to be considered generalizable. Second, our post-mortem measurement of p-tau levels may have precluded us from detecting important associations between cognition and p-tau in early disease stages. P-tau 217 and 202 were ascertained from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue and may not accurately reflect p-tau load in other regions of the brain that are affected earlier in the course of AD. While recent work has shown post-mortem brain p-tau 217 correlates across regions, plasma p-tau 217 might be a better indicator of overall cerebral p-tau load and should be the focus of follow-up studies (Wennström et al., 2022). Moreover, use of in vivo plasma biomarkers would enable temporal linkage of cognitive performance and p-tau levels in preclinical stages, which we were not able to do in this study with post-mortem measures. This study was also limited in that we did not have measures of p-tau 181 available for comparison, which would have been helpful to demonstrate greater specificity for primacy recall as a key cognitive correlate of current gold-standard tau biomarkers for preclinical AD. Lastly, we were not able to derive serial position ratio scores from the CERAD Word List Memory test because the order of the word list changes across trials. However, it is possible that had we been able to derive primacy or recency ratio scores that capture information from serial position performance on both immediate and delayed trials, we may have observed an even stronger predictive effect for baseline serial position score performance relative to delayed recall. Total recall scores have historically been favoured over process scores due to their stronger psychometric properties, so ideally future studies will consider combining serial position ratio scores with additional process scores (e.g., learning slope, intrusion errors) to derive even more robust cognitive markers of preclinical AD. Nonetheless, the main strength of the current study lies in its additive translational value, providing complementary evidence from post-mortem tissue of the link between cognitive process scores and p-tau levels in the brain assessed across time and in different stages of disease.

Overall, the findings of this work showcase the value in examining serial position scores, in addition to the routinely used total recall scores, as markers of early and subtle cognitive changes that take place many years before the onset of dementia. Analysis of serial position scores could serve as a useful prognostic screening tools where expensive and invasive biomarker assessments like PET scans and lumbar punctures remain inaccessible or clinically contraindicated. This work also has implications for “integrated diagnostics” (e.g., Garibotto et al., 2021), whereby the serial position scores, and cognitive process scores more generally, could have added value when combined with existing ATN biomarkers to track disease state and progression (O’Shea et al., 2021; Pichet Binette et al., 2022), as well as treatment response in AD drug trials (Ashton et al., 2022).
