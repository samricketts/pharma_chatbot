Familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is a rare early-onset genetic form of a common dementia of old age. Striking in middle age, FAD is caused by missense mutations in three genes: APP (encoding the amyloid precursor protein) and PSEN1 and PSEN2 (encoding presenilin-1 and presenilin-2). APP is proteolytically processed successively by β-secretase and γ-secretase to produce the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Presenilin is the catalytic component of γ-secretase, a membrane-embedded aspartyl protease complex that cleaves APP within its single transmembrane domain to produce Aβ of varying lengths. Thus, all FAD mutations are found in the substrate and the enzyme that produce Aβ. The 42-residue variant Aβ42 has been the primary focus of Alzheimer drug discovery for over two decades, as this particular peptide is highly prone to aggregation, is the major protein deposited in the characteristic cerebral plaques of Alzheimer’s disease, and is proportionately elevated in FAD. Despite extensive efforts, all agents targeting Aβ and Aβ42 have failed in the clinic, including γ-secretase inhibitors, leading to questioning of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer pathogenesis. However, processing of the APP transmembrane domain by γ-secretase is complex, involving initial endoproteolysis followed by successive carboxypeptidase trimming steps to secreted Aβ peptides such as Aβ42. Recent findings reveal that FAD mutations in PSEN1 and in APP result in deficient trimming of initially formed long Aβ peptides. A logical drug discovery strategy for FAD could therefore involve the search for compounds that rescue this deficient carboxypeptidase activity. The rare early-onset FAD arguably presents a simpler path to developing effective therapeutics compared to the much more complex heterogeneous sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease is a common dementia of old age characterized pathologically by the cerebral deposition of extra-neuronal amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles [1]. The plaques are primarily composed of the 4 kDa amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), particularly the aggregation-prone 42-residue variant Aβ42, while the tangles are comprised of the microtubule-associate protein tau. Critical clues to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease came from genetic studies of rare dominantly inherited forms with onset in midlife [2]. This familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is identical to the sporadic late-onset form of the disease in pathology, presentation, and progression. Between 1991 and 1999, FAD-linked mutations were found to reside in the substrate and the enzyme that produce Aβ, implicating this aggregation-prone peptide as the initiator of the disease process.

Aβ peptides are generated through proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)(Fig. 1), a single-pass membrane protein of unclear function expressed in most human cells. APP is first cleaved by β-secretase, a membrane-tethered aspartyl protease in the pepsin family [3], releasing the large extracellular domain and leaving a 99-residue C-terminal remnant (C99) in the membrane. The latter is then proteolyzed within its transmembrane domain (TMD) by γ-secretase to release the APP intracellular domain into the cytosol and secrete from the cell Aβ peptides of 39 to 43 amino acids in length. The discovery in 1991 of missense mutations associated with FAD in the gene encoding APP [4, 5] led to formulation of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer pathogenesis [6], especially as these mutations were located in and around the small 4 kDa Aβ region of the 70–80 kDa APP.

Initially, the production of Aβ was thought to be a pathological event, with the APP TMD being somehow forced out of the membrane for hydrolysis by the unidentified γ-secretase. However, soon after discovery of the first FAD mutations in APP, Aβ was found to be produced and secreted as a normal process from cultured cells [7]. In 1995, missense mutations in two new related genes were discovered to be associated with FAD [8–10]. The encoded multi-pass membrane proteins, presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and presenilin-2 (PSEN2), bore little homology with known proteins at the time, and their biochemical functions and cellular roles were completely unclear. FAD-mutant presenilins, however, were soon found to increase the ratio of the plaque-associated Aβ42 to the predominant 40-residue form Aβ40 [11, 12]. Thus, presenilin mutations could alter γ-secretase processing of APP substrate C99 in producing Aβ.

Presenilin and the γ-secretase complex

Presenilins themselves were found to undergo proteolytic processing, in a large lumenal/extracellular loop between TMD 6 and TMD 7, to form an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and C-terminal fragment (CTF)[13](Fig. 2). The formation of NTF and CTF is tightly regulated by limiting cellular factors [14], and these presenilin fragments remain associated, assemble into a high-molecular weight complex, and have a long biological half-life compared to the full-length protein [15–18]. Thus, the active form of presenilin, whatever its function might be, appeared to be the NTF/CTF heterodimer within a larger complex.

Two contemporaneous studies led to the discovery of presenilin as a novel membrane-embedded aspartyl protease. One was the finding that knockout of the PSEN1 gene dramatically decreased γ-secretase cleavage of APP C99 to Aβ [19]. The remaining activity was attributed to PSEN2, later shown to be the case [20, 21]. This finding demonstrated that presenilin is required for γ-secretase activity. The second key study was the finding that aspartyl protease transition-state mimetics based on the proteolytic cleavage site in the APP TMD could inhibit γ-secretase activity in cell culture [22, 23]. Thus, γ-secretase appeared to be an aspartyl protease. Considering these two key observations together led to the discovery of two conserved TMD aspartates in presenilin, one in TMD 6 and one in TMD 7 (Fig. 2), that are essential for γ-secretase activity [24]. Moreover, these two TMD aspartates were essential for presenilin cleavage to NTF and CTF. Thus, presenilin was suggested to be γ-secretase, activated by autoproteolysis through interaction with limiting cellular factors [25]. Conversion of transition state analog inhibitors to affinity labeling reagents resulted in specific covalent tagging of presenilin NTF and CTF [26, 27], demonstrating that the active site of γ-secretase resided at the interface between these two presenilin subunits, each of which contributes one of the two essential aspartates.

The limiting cellular factors were later discovered to be three other membrane proteins: nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 [28](Fig. 2). Upon assembly of presenilin with its protein partners, presenilin undergoes self-cleavage to NTF and CTF to become the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex. The means by which TMD substrates access the active site was suggested by co-purification of an APP substrate upon affinity isolation of the γ-secretase complex with an immobilized transition state analog inhibitor [29]. Although the active site was occupied by the resin-bound inhibitor, substrate was also associated with the enzyme, suggesting an initial substrate docking exosite on γ-secretase that is distinct from the active site. Initially docked substrate apparently moves in whole or in part through lateral gating into the internal active site. This docking site is apparently the site of binding for designed helical peptide inhibitors based on the APP TMD [30, 31]. Affinity reagents based on these helical peptide inhibitors label presenilin NTF and CTF, and this labeling is not blocked by transition state analog inhibitors [32]. The reverse is also true: affinity reagents based on transition state analog inhibitors are not blocked by helical peptide inhibitors.

In recent years, the structure of the γ-secretase complex has been elucidated through cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) and single-particle analysis [33]. The structure reveals the two conserved TMD aspartates in close proximity, although not aligned properly for catalysis. The structure of the protease complex bound to APP substrate was later solved [34], showing the substrate inside the presenilin component in a helical conformation that unwinds into a β-strand in the active site. However, to elucidate this structure, one of the active site aspartates was mutated to alanine, and cysteine mutagenesis allowed disulfide crosslinking between substrate (near the N-terminus) and presenilin (within the L1 loop). Thus, the active site was not active, and the crosslinking might lead to artifacts. Most recently, substrate-based “structural probes” were developed for the study of γ-secretase [35]. These compounds link a helical peptide inhibitor to a transition-state analog inhibitor through a linker region. Thus, these probes are designed to trap the enzyme at the transition state, as it would be when bound to full TMD substrate and poised for intramembrane proteolysis. Elucidation of these probes bound to the protease complex are underway.

Failures of γ-secretase inhibitors

The discovery of FAD mutations in presenilins and APP and elucidation of the γ-secretase complex raised hopes that the development of selective brain-penetrating inhibitors of this protease activity would lead to disease-modifying therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease. Highly potent inhibitors were subsequently discovered that were capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, likely a consequence of the hydrophobic nature of the substrate binding sites on the membrane-embedded protease complex. These compounds (e.g., Fig. 3) could effectively lower plasma and brain Aβ levels in animal models [36–38]. However, concerns had been raised early on about toxicity due to blocking proteolysis of other γ-secretase substrates [39]. The enzyme complex is now known to cleave over 100 different membrane protein stubs remaining after extracellular domain shedding by membrane tethered proteases [40], and this property has led to γ-secretase being called the “proteasome of the membrane” [41].

Arguably, the most important γ-secretase substrate in all of biology is the Notch family of cell-surface receptors [42]. These receptors initiate signaling pathways critical for cell-fate determinations during development and adulthood in all multi-cellular animals. Cell-surface ligands on neighboring cells trigger proteolytic events, culminating in γ-secretase cleavage of the TMD of Notch and release of its intracellular domain. Freed from the membrane, the intracellular domain then translocates to the nucleus and activates certain transcription factors that turn on the expression of genes that control cell differentiation. Knockout of presenilins or other γ-secretase components in mice leads to embryonic lethality and a phenotype closely similar to that of Notch1 knockout mice [43, 44]. It therefore came as little surprise when γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) caused serious toxic effects in adult animal models associated with Notch signaling deficiencies, including immunosuppression and bloody diarrhea [45, 46].

Still, hope remained that doses of GSIs could be administered that would lower brain Aβ levels sufficiently to treat Alzheimer’s disease while leaving enough Notch signaling to avoid peripheral side effects. Such hopes were further raised by the discovery of “Notch-sparing” GSIs, compounds that could inhibit γ-secretase cleavage of C99 to Aβ with variable degrees of selectivity vis-à-vis Notch [47]. Both non-selective and “Notch-sparing” GSIs, however, caused toxicities expected from Notch signaling deficits [48, 49]. More worrying, although both compounds could lower plasma and CSF Aβ levels, administration led to cognitive worsening of Alzheimer patients enrolled in clinical trials [48, 49]. One reason could be due to elevation of APP substrate C99, which is implicated in toxicity [50]. Indeed, GSIs have been shown to cause cognitive deficits at lower doses in APP transgenic mice than in non-transgenic control mice [51]. These dismal clinical trial failures marked the end of the development of GSIs for Alzheimer’s disease. However, efforts to repurpose GSIs for the treatment of Notch-driven cancers are still ongoing [52].

FAD mutations and Aβ production

The clinical trial failures of GSIs, particularly the cognitive worsening seen even with those selective for APP versus Notch, has led to reconsideration of the amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer pathogenesis, particularly the notion that Aβ42 aggregation is the initiating molecular event. All current drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease are symptomatic and do not slow or halt the underlying neurodegeneration, and no new drug has been approved since 2003. Of the many failures in late-stage clinical trials, the majority of these have targeted Aβ aggregates directly or indirectly, although the lack of efficacy could be due to intervening too late, when the disease process may become Aβ-independent and tau-driven. More concerning has been the lack of clarity about molecular pathogenesis, including the assembly state of neurotoxic Aβ, the identity of a receptor for neurotoxic Aβ, or the connection between pathogenic Aβ and pathogenic tau. Provocatively, a study of 138 PSEN1 FAD-mutant γ-secretase complex found that many of these mutations did not elevate Aβ42/Aβ40, long considered the common feature of FAD mutations in presenilins [53].

Despite the many gaps in the amyloid hypothesis, a pathogenic role of some form of Aβ seems inescapable for FAD. Every one of the &gt;200 known FAD mutations are found in the substrate or the enzyme that produces Aβ [54], and all alter the production or properties of Aβ. How then do FAD mutations initiate pathogenesis? Solving this problem requires considering the complexity of proteolytic processing of the APP TMD by the γ-secretase complex. In addition to the secreted forms of Aβ peptides of 38–43 amino acids in length, low levels of membrane-associated Aβ that are 45–49 residues long are produced through the action of γ-secretase. In 2009, a study by the laboratory of Yasuo Ihara of the University of Tokyo definitively demonstrated that γ-secretase cleaves the APP TMD multiple times along two pathways in generating secreted Aβ peptides [55]. First, the protease cuts near the cytosolic side of the TMD to release AICD and form Aβ48 or Aβ49. These long Aβ peptides are then trimmed, generally in intervals of three amino acids, through a carboxypeptidase activity of γ-secretase along two pathways: Aβ49→Aβ46→Aβ43→Aβ40 and Aβ48→Aβ45→Aβ42→Aβ38 (Fig. 4).

How do FAD mutations affect this complex processing? A 2011 study found that five different PSEN1 FAD-mutant γ-secretase complexes increased the proportion of Aβ peptides of 45 residues and longer compared with wild-type enzyme, as detected by long, hand-cast urea-PAGE [56]. A follow-up study demonstrated that these same five FAD-mutant complexes were dramatically deficient in their ability to convert synthetic Aβ48 and Aβ49 to Aβ40 and Aβ42 [57]. Most recently, quantitative analysis by LC-MS/MS of all the co-products of Aβ production (AICD and small peptides) by γ-secretase in purified enzyme assays allowed deduction that 14 different FAD mutations in the APP TMD led to elevated production of Aβ peptides of 45 residues and longer [58]. In contrast, two of these mutations did not result in elevated Aβ42/Aβ40. These long Aβ peptides, with most of the APP TMD are not secreted from cells and are membrane-anchored. Collectively dubbed “dark amyloid” [59], they may contribute to pathogenesis in FAD.

γ-secretase modulators

The findings that FAD mutations are deficient in trimming long Aβ peptides suggests that, rather than inhibition of γ-secretase, what is needed is stimulation of the carboxypeptidase activity, at least for FAD. Interestingly, such compounds are already known and have been under development for 20 years. These compounds, called γ-secretase modulators (GSMs), lower Aβ42 production by the enzyme without inhibiting overall Aβ levels [60]. GSMs accomplish this by stimulating the Aβ42→Aβ38 trimming step.

The first compounds found to possess this promising activity were a subset of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and sulindac sulfide [61]. Although the potency of these compounds for lowering Aβ42 production was poor, in the mid-micromolar range, they provided an important proof of principle that such selective reduction was possible. The search was on to identify more potent, selective, and brain-penetrating GSMs, leading to low nanomolar compounds with promising pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., Fig. 5; [62]). Although such compounds are largely quite safe and lower the form of Aβ thought to be pathogenic, so far none have demonstrated clinical efficacy. Again, this could be due to administration to subjects who already have developed symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, with substantial neurodegeneration in the hippocampus, a critical area of the brain for learning and memory.

By the time symptoms appear, the disease is likely to be Aβ-independent and driven by the spread of tau pathology. Aβ deposition in FAD can apparently occur 15–25 years before the expected age of onset [63], while tau pathology occurs later and correlates more closely with neurodegeneration [64]. Tau aggregation can spread from neuron to neuron in a prion-like manner, with seeds of filamentous tau from one neuron passed to a neighboring neuron through synaptic transmission to nucleate tau aggregation [65]. Thus, GSM treatment after symptoms appear may be expected to be ineffective. Alternatively, Aβ42 may not be the actual pathogenic entity.

Hypothesis: γ-secretase activators for FAD

FAD mutations in both presenilin-1 and APP examined to date are deficient in the first and/or second carboxypeptidase trimming step and elevate Aβ peptides of 45-to-49 residues in length [56, 58]. Thus, elevation of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and Aβ42 aggregation in FAD may be epiphenomenon, with the actual pathogenic entity being longer Aβ peptides (“dark amyloid”), which contain most of the APP transmembrane domain and are membrane-anchored [59]. Possible mechanisms for neurotoxicity of these long variants include: (1) dissociation from γ-secretase and assembly of these peptides with each other, which could disrupt the membrane; (2) dissociation from γ-secretase and interaction with other membrane proteins, such as receptors, to trigger a neurotoxic signaling pathway; and (3) the stalled γ-secretase complexes themselves—bound to these long Aβ peptides and unable to efficiently trim them down—could be the neurotoxic trigger.

Whatever the mechanism, the deficiency in the first and/or second trimming steps appears to be the problem, which suggests that rescuing this deficiency with a small molecule to stimulate trimming in general could be therapeutic for FAD. Given the discovery of GSMs that enhance Aβ42→Aβ38 trimming, perhaps modification of these structures could lead to identification of general γ-secretase activators of trimming. Such compounds should be selective for enhancing trimming over endopeptidase activity. That is, they should not be stimulators of overall γ-secretase activity, as this would result in not only increased total Aβ production but also increased cleavage of other substrates such as Notch. As Notch is an oncogene and γ-secretase cleavage of Notch is part of its normal signaling mechanism, nonselective stimulation of Notch processing by γ-secretase might be expected to cause cancer. Selective activation of trimming on the other hand would be expected to be safe, only involving clearing of long substrate intermediates.

FAD is a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease, representing only 1–2% of all cases. Nevertheless, the complete penetrance of these dominant mutations, fating carriers to this devastating neurodegenerative disease in midlife, suggests that elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms should be more straightforward than for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, which is much more heterogeneous and complex. As all FAD mutations are found in the substrate and the enzyme that produces Aβ, something about altered APP processing by γ-secretase must be responsible for pathogenesis. The common alteration seems to be deficient carboxypeptidase trimming. Therefore, a logical drug discovery strategy for FAD would be to screen for compounds that rescue this enzymatic deficiency. Regardless of the identity of the pathogenic entity and downstream effects, such rescue of trimming deficiency in FAD would be expected to be preventative if given early enough presymptomatically. An example of successful rescue of deficient function of a membrane protein in a genetic disease is found in cystic fibrosis, for which small molecules have been approved that potentiate dysfunctional mutated chloride channels [66]. Drug discovery campaigns for sporadic Alzheimer’s disease have all led to failure. Perhaps a focus on the solvable problem of FAD would be more appropriate and likely to succeed.
