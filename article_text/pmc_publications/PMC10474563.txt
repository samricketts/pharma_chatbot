Mini abstract

Loss-of-function variants of TREM2 increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A new study presents a therapeutic candidate, ATV:TREM2, a TREM2 activating antibody engineered with a transferrin receptor binding site to facilitating blood-to-brain transport. ATV:TREM2 treatment in AD model mice improved energy metabolism and microglial function.


pmcTriggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is expressed by microglia in the brain and is strongly linked to risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1, 2 TREM2 enables microglial phagocytosis and activation in response to AD pathology via activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway,3 which is essential for the transition of homeostatic microglia to an activated state.4 Because loss-of-function of TREM2 is associated with increased AD risk, significant efforts have been devoted to developing TREM2 agonist antibodies to enhance TREM2 signaling and related microglial functions.5, 6 However, like other drug candidates, the effective delivery of TREM2 antibody from the periphery to the brain is restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this issue of Nature Neuroscience, the authors van Lengerich, Zhan, Xia et al.7 reported a novel engineered TREM2 antibody that takes advantage of transferrin receptor (TfR)-mediated transcytosis across the BBB to shuttle a high-affinity TREM2 antibody to the brain and demonstrate its effects on TREM2 signaling and microglial function (Figure 1).

As an endocytic receptor enriched at the BBB, TfR-mediated transcytosis has been extensively explored to shuttle antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates across the BBB.8 To deliver TREM2 activating antibodies, the authors7 utilized the antibody transport vehicle (ATV), which comprises an engineered Fc fragment with a monovalent human TfR binding site that exploits receptor-mediated transcytosis for brain delivery.9 The human IgG backbone contains LALA mutations (Leu234Ala, Leu235Ala) to reduce FcR binding. The high affinity human TREM2 activating antibodies, including the previously reported 4D96 and a newly developed TREM2 antibody, were then cloned together with ATV to generate the ATV:4D9 and ATV:TREM2 antibodies (Figure 1a). One key feature of ATV:TREM2 is its relatively low affinity (micromolar) to the TfR to allow efficient dissociation upon transcytosis. This contrasts the high affinity (low nanomolar) of ATV:TREM2 for TREM2.

To test the brain biodistribution of these newly engineered TREM2 antibodies, the authors intravenously injected them into knock-in mice expressing human TfR because the ATV does not cross-react with mouse TfR. They found that compared to 4D9, the ATV:4D9 improves parenchymal TREM2 antibody delivery by ~10 fold one day post-injection. The ATV:4D9 biodistribution is largely driven by binding to TfR rather than TREM2 (Figure 1b). Importantly, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging using radiolabeled antibodies shows a broad distribution of ATV:TREM2 throughout the entire brain, which represents a significant improvement when compared to naive anti-TREM2 antibody.

To understand next what the microglial state changes are and how long the changes persist in response to TREM2 treatment, the authors performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with mice single-dosed peripherally with ATV:4D9 or isotype control at 1-, 7-, 14-, and 28-days post-dosing. They found that microglial populations shift dramatically at 24 hours post-dosing with ATV:4D9. These responsive microglial clusters, showing activation and proliferation gene signatures, are largely undetectable by day 7, and return to homeostasis at 14- and 28-days post-dosing, suggesting that ATV:4D9 induces temporally dynamic state of microglia. Interestingly, the microglia activation induced by ATV:4D9 is distinct from the disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature shown in AD mouse models.10 In alignment with the dynamic and reversible transcriptional changes observed with scRNA-seq, profound morphological changes were also observed in microglia at 1- and 7-days post ATV:4D9 dosing compared to an isotype control, which returned to baseline 14 days post-dosing, indicating that ATV:4D9 induced microglia changes are transient and reversible.

At the molecular and cellular level, the authors identified four key features by which ATV:TREM2 antibody robustly activates TREM2 signaling in microglia. First, similar to the 4D9 antibody, they showed that this novel TREM2 antibody also acts as a TREM2 shedding blocker with reduction of soluble TREM2. Second, the ATV:TREM2 antibody does not interfere with lipid binding to TREM2 which is crucial for TREM2 signaling. Third, using biotin proximity labeling of cell surface TREM2, it was shown that ATV:TREM2 treatment leads to enhanced TREM2 cell surface clustering, which is mediated by simultaneous interactions with both TREM2 and TfR (Figure 1c). Finally, they showed that TfR-mediated endocytosis facilitates the ATV:TREM2 endocytic trafficking which may further contribute to enhanced TREM2 signaling (Figure 1d).

Next, the authors evaluated the microglial changes induced by ATV:TREM2. Through gene expression profiling, similar to ATV:4D9, ATV:TREM2 induces elevated cell cycle G2M checkpoint gene signature and microglia activation gene signature. This activation is distinct from those upon treatment with TGFβ, a cytokine that promotes homeostasis, or with proinflammatory/mitogenic stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or IFNγ. Utilizing the culture of human iPSC-derived microglia (iMG) and the TREM2 BAC transgenic mouse model expressing human TREM2, the authors showed that ATV:TREM2 treatment results in phosphorylation of key modulators of the mTOR pathway, such as mTOR and AKT, consistent with previous report.3 Functionally, the ATV:TREM2 treatment increases microglia proliferation which requires mTOR signaling and PLCγ2. Additionally, ATV:TREM2 enhances microglial phagocytosis ex vivo, including the phagocytic uptake of myelin and amyloid-β (Aβ).

Furthermore, activating TREM2 signaling by ATV:TREM2 treatment significantly reduces several triglyceride (TG) lipid species in iMGs, concomitant with an increase in numerous acyl carnitine species which are the byproducts of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with these findings, the authors showed that ATV:TREM2 treatment increases mitochondrial membrane potential and boosts mitochondrial respiration and glucose metabolism, consistent with the upregulated oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis pathway genes both in iMGs and in microglia from hTREM2 transgenic mice. Interestingly, the ATV:TREM2-mediated lipid catabolism and mitochondrial function also require PLCγ2, further emphasizing the interconnection between PLCγ2 and TREM2 signaling.11

Finally, the effects of ATV:TREM2 treatment were tested in AD transgenic mouse model (5xFAD/hTREM2/hTfR). Multiple PET scans including [18F]GE-180 18kDa translocator protein positron-emission-tomography (TSPO-PET), 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-PET, and [18F] florbetaben beta-amyloid (FBB)-PET were applied to monitor brain microglial activity, glucose metabolism, and amyloid deposition, respectively. It was shown that ATV:TREM2 increases cortical microglial activity and glucose metabolism 8 days post-dosing of ATV:TREM2. These effects were small or absence in wild-type mice lacking amyloid pathology. Additionally, there was a significant regional association for TSPO-PET and FDG-PET at day 8 with FBB signal, suggesting the presence of Aβ impacts ATV:TREM2 effects. Nonetheless, the overall amyloid plaque load did not change, likely due to the short duration of the ATV:TREM2 treatment.

Overall, the authors provide convincing evidence that ATV:TREM2 might be a potential therapeutic candidate for targeting brain TREM2 by impacting microglial proliferation, phagocytotic function, activation, and energy metabolism.7 However, an important unanswered question of this study is the effect of ATV:TREM2 chronic treatment on amyloid pathology and related toxicity. In fact, similar engineering concept of a bispecific TREM2 agonist antibody targeting TREM2 and TfR was also reported recently by Zhao et al.12 In their study, long-term treatment of 5xFAD amyloid model mice with the engineered antibody (weekly injection for 14 weeks from 5 months of age) leads to a significant reduction of amyloid burden and endogenous tau hyperphosphorylation.12 Such study demonstrates the potential of chronic treatment of TREM2 agonist antibody in reducing amyloid pathology, a critical pathogenic event related to TREM2-mediated microglial function.

Although TfR represents an attractive target to shuttle biological agents to the brain, its relatively high expression in peripheral cells such as reticulocytes could trigger undesirable side effects. In this regard, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), a transcytosis receptor with expression confined more to brain endothelial cells compared with the periphery, has been reported as a safe and efficient molecular shuttle that can be applicable for brain disorders.13 As such, additional studies including direct comparison in their transport efficiency, as well as safety and efficacy assessments, are needed to develop the most effective, versatile, and safe platform for delivering therapeutics such as TREM2 antibody into the brain.

AD is a complex chronic disease involving multiple pathogenic pathways including proteinopathy, vascular pathology, and deleterious immune responses. Effective treatment will likely need to be individualized with the right drug, at the right time, for the right patient. In targeting TREM2, a critical challenge is to define the best time window to activate TREM2 signaling for AD therapy. It has been shown that elevating TREM2-related signaling pathway and enhancing TREM2 function leads to beneficial effects against AD pathology in the early stage of AD development.14, 15 A recent study using 5xFAD mice with AD-tau injection demonstrates that chronic administration (weekly injection for three months, from 6 months to 9 months old) of an activating TREM2 antibody surprisingly increased peri-plaque tau pathology and neuritic dystrophy, without altering Aβ plaque burden.16 Future translational and clinical studies will be needed to determine how to tailor these approaches for optimal benefit.
