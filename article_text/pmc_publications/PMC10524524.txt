INTRODUCTION:

It is unclear if sex differences exist in cognitive disease progression in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia associated with atrial fibrillation (AF).

METHODS:

Using a variety of statistical methods, we examined sex differences between AF and neuropsychological tests and cognitive disease progression, using the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center data (N=43,630).

RESULTS:

AF is associated with higher odds of dementia (OR 3.00, 95% CI [1.22, 7.37] in women and MCI in women (OR 3.43, 95% CI [1.55, 7.55]) versus men. Women with AF and normal baseline cognition had a higher risk of disease progression (HR 1.26, 95% CI [1.06, 1.50]) from normal to MCI and from MCI to vascular dementia (HR 3.27, 95% CI [1.89, 5.65]) than men with AF or men and women without AF.

DISCUSSION:

AF was associated with more rapid progression to MCI and dementia in women, but more research is needed to confirm these findings.

pmc1. INTRODUCTION

Over recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of cognitive dysfunction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).1–7 A major public health problem, AF has serious consequences including stroke and heart failure, and has been identified as an independent risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).2,3,5–8 AF occurs in approximately 10% of adults over 70 years of age and 20% of patients over 80.9–11 The mechanisms of AF are unknown, but common risk factors include hypertension (HTN), older age (&gt; 65 years), diabetes mellitus, obesity, and heart failure.12–14 Risk factors such as HTN, diabetes, and obesity are thought to increase systemic inflammation leading to AF,15,16 and more frequent recurrences of the arrhythmia. Evolving current demographics show the population is aging anticipating a 2.5-3.0 fold increase in AF by 2050 with a resulting increased prevalence of older adults having both AF and cognitive dysfunction.9,11,17,18 The increased risk of MCI/ADRD with AF is independent of prior stroke or other shared risk factors with both AF and AD, such as age, HTN, diabetes, and systemic inflammation.1,5–8,19–24 Risk factors for AF-associated ADRD include older age, obesity, diabetes, prior stroke, and apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype; whereas risk factors for AF associated vascular MCI/dementia were male sex and prior stroke.1

Investigators have reported prevalence of MCI/ADRD in adults with AF to be 40% higher than in those without AF.1,5 While the mechanism remains unclear, potential processes include subclinical cerebral ischemia, cerebral hypoperfusion, inflammation, hippocampal atrophy, and genetic predisposition.19–21,23 Risk of AF associated ADRD has also been linked to the length of time one has been living with AF, suggesting that AF patients may be at risk of a more rapid progression of MCI to ADRD at a younger age than typically seen in individuals without AF.23,25,26

Women with AF experience more symptoms and worse outcomes of AF than men.27–32 Women are at higher risk than men of MCI and ADRD in general, which is also true of AF-related stroke.23,24 However, other reports find no AF-related MCI in women aged 65-7933 and higher incidence of poor abstract reasoning and loss of executive function skills in men with AF than in women with AF.34 To identify those at highest risk of AF associated cognitive decline, greater understanding is needed about how AF affects the rate of progression of MCI and ADRD, and whether differences by sex exist. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between AF and risk of MCI and ADRD and disease progression, and cognitive test performance, using data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) clinical case series. We further investigated whether sex modifies the AF – ADRD association.

2. METHODS

We used the NIH-sponsored NACC database (43,746 subjects as of March, 2021) for this secondary analysis to compare cognitive and functional changes in patients with AF to those without AF.35 The NACC Uniform Data Set (UDS), established in 1999 and funded by the National Institute of Aging (NIA), includes prospective, clinical case series data from more than 40 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) located at urban, university affiliated medical centers across the US. The UDS is one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of its type in the world (NIA, U01 AG016976). Sponsored by the NIA, ADRCs were started in 1984 to promote research on diseases related to cognitive aging.35,36 A standardized clinical and cognitive longitudinal evaluation, the NACC reflects total enrollment at ADRCs since 2005 with baseline and annual follow-ups including subjects with a range of aging related diagnoses — normal cognition, MCI, and AD.36

Each ADRC site enrolls subjects according to specific protocols. Subjects may come from clinician referral, self-referral by patients or family members, active recruitment through community organizations, and volunteers who wish to contribute to dementia research. Most ADRCs also enroll participants with normal cognition, who tend to be highly educated and have a family history of ADRD. Institutional Review Board approval is obtained from each ADRC, and written informed consent is obtained from all participants or a participant representative.

The NACC database is longitudinal, and protocol includes annual or semi-annual follow-up as long as the subject is able to participate. Diagnosis is made by either a consensus team (within centers) or a single examining physician; this process varies according to each ADRC’s protocol. Currently the NACC UDS data file includes all visits for participants. Data are obtained (by trained clinicians and study staff) from subjects during structured interviews and a cognitive test battery during in-person and virtual visits, home visits, and telephone calls. The neuropsychological test battery is administered by a trained psychometrist or clinical professional under the supervision of a clinical neuropsychologist. NACC monitors the reliability of data via range and logic checks.

2.1 Study Participants

Participant data were extracted as of March 2021. Participants underwent annual diagnostic, cognitive and functional assessments and had three or more annual visits from a total of 38 ADRCs in the NACC database were considered in our analytical set.

2.2 Ascertainment of Atrial Fibrillation Diagnosis

Presence of AF was derived using both clinician-reported health information and self-reported medical history. AF was considered as missing only when both sources of information were not available. For participants with missing AF information at baseline but reported no AF at a follow-up, their AF at baseline or earlier visits was assumed to be absent. On the other hand, participants may have developed AF over time, thus AF was considered as a time-invariant and a time-varying variable in the analysis. Specifically, for participants who developed AF at a later follow-up visit, the first time point with a positive AF diagnosis was considered as the baseline visit in the analysis of baseline cognition data and survival analysis (see below).

2.3 Assessment of Cognitive Function

To investigate the association between AF and cognitive function, performance on nine neuropsychological tests administered at all ADRCs at the baseline visit were considered.36 Overall, five domains were evaluated: attention, language, memory, executive functioning, and global cognition. Attention was assessed according to the maximum number of correct trials for Digit Span Forward (DIGIF) and Digit Span Backward (DIGIB).37 Language was examined according to the 30-item version of the Boston Naming Test (BOSTON).38 Memory tests included verbal episodic memory (immediate and delayed story recall)37 and semantic memory (ANIMALS).39 Executive functioning was measured using set-shifting tasks and rapid alternation of numbers and letters (Part B of the Trail Making Test [TRAILB]).37 The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) were used to assess global cognition.40 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) assesses three cognitive domains (memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving) and three functional domains (community affairs, home and hobbies, personal care) using structured interviews with the subject and an informant.41 Scores on each domain range from 0 (no impairment) to 3 (severe impairment), and a total score is generated by summing the domain scores to yield an index of the overall degree of impairment (0–18 points; CDR Sum of Boxes [CDR-SUM]).

The NACC subjects received a clinical diagnosis at every visit based on NIA guidelines. A total of four clinical diagnoses were included in our study: normal cognition, cognitively impaired but not MCI, MCI, and dementia. Given the uncertainty in the intermediate cognitive impairment diagnosis “cognitive impairment but not MCI”, observations with such diagnosis were excluded.

2.4 Statistical Analysis

Baseline cross-sectional association between AF and neuropsychological test performance was assessed initially using separate linear regression models for each of the nine cognitive tests. To examine the association between AF and decline in cognition performance over time, each of the neuropsychological tests was regressed on AF, follow-up time (in years), and the interaction of AF by follow-up time using linear mixed models with subject-specific intercept to account for correlation between repeated measurements within subject. Baseline cross-sectional association between AF and cognitive diagnosis (normal, MCI, or dementia) was examined using multinomial logistic regression. In all the models above, baseline age, sex, race (black, white, others), education level (high school or below, bachelor, and advanced degrees), baseline cognitive diagnosis (normal or MCI), body mass index (BMI), smoking history, depression (past two years), sleep apnea (yes, no, unknown), HTN, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, stroke, and heart failure were included as covariates. In addition, interactions between AF and sex as well as AF, sex, and follow-up time were examined to examine if sex modifies the associations. To handle multiple testing correction for these highly correlated tests, the significance level for each test was adjusted using the effective number of independent tests.42 The modified test-wise significance level was 0.01.

To investigate the relationship between AF and disease progression (from normal to MCI, and to dementia) among those who not yet developed dementia, we derived time to first progression in diagnosis stage for each subject. Those with diagnostic “regression” over time (e.g., MCI to normal cognition) were excluded for this analysis. Cox proportional hazards model (with cause-specific hazards function) was used to estimate the effect of AF with adjustment for baseline diagnosis (normal or MCI). The model further adjusted ADRC site and incorporated site-specific random intercepts to account for potential correlations in outcomes among subjects enrolled in the same ADRC (frailty model). The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated by assessing interaction terms between log time and each of the predictors and using scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Overall goodness of fit was assessed by plotting Cox Snell residuals.

Lastly, multi-state models were used to model the progression of diagnosis using time-varying AF status and all available cognition stage data to further understand different types of dementia. Diagnosis was modeled as a process with three states (normal, MCI, and dementia) and multiple possible transitions from “normal cognition” to “MCI”, and from “MCI” to “ADRD”, “dementia - vascular type”, “dementia - mixed type”, or “dementia - other types”. In the NACC database, subjects were observed at enrollment and follow-up visits regardless of their initial cognitive diagnosis, in which case the transition times (the exact time point when subjects developed MCI or dementia) are not exactly observed (i.e., left-truncation and interval-censored observations). We assumed that the truncation and censoring mechanisms are independent from the process, meaning that the censored individuals can be represented by those without censoring. The choices between Markov and semi-Markov models, and between time-homogeneous and non-homogeneous models were based on likelihood ratio test.

Age, sex, race, education, BMI, smoking status, depression, and ADRD related vascular comorbidities (HTN, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, history of heart failure, history of stroke) were considered as covariates in all analyses related to progression of cognitive impairment (based on the NACC cognition diagnosis) over time. Each covariate was also considered as a potential effect modifier in analysis, and interaction between AF and sex were specifically examined in all models. Analysis was conducted using R version 4.0.3.

3. RESULTS

3.1 Participants

Figure S1 shows the Consort diagram of participants included in the initial analyses. As seen in Table 1, out of 43,630 participants, 4,593 had AF at baseline. The AF group was 46% female, with a mean age of 78.5 (± 8) years, 81% White, 8% Black, and 11% other ethnicities. The median follow-up time was approximately 4 years (interquartile range [2.25, 6.65]). Among the 13,683 subjects included in the survival analysis, 4066 (30%) progressed to a worse stage of cognitive impairment, and 2895 (21%) developed dementia (of which 2434 [18%] involved ADRD).

3.2 Neuropsychological Test Differences in Atrial Fibrillation

Table 2 shows estimated differences in neuropsychological test scores at baseline and in the changes per year in subjects with and without AF. The MMSE was replaced by the MoCA in NACC data collection as of 2008,43 so the longitudinal change in MoCA score was not analyzed. There were significant declines in 5 out of 8 cognitive tests in domains of executive function, verbal ability, and memory among participants with AF compared to participants without AF. No significant sex differences were found in these associations after multiple testing adjustment.

Table 3 presents estimated odds ratios of cognitive diagnosis (MCI or dementia vs. normal cognition) at baseline. There was a significant interaction between sex and AF. After adjusting for covariates, having AF is associated with higher odds of having MCI (OR 3.43, 95% CI [1.55, 7.55] in women vs. men (OR 1.73, 95% CI [0.81, 3.71]) and dementia (OR 3.00, 95% CI [1.22, 7.37] in women vs. men (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.16, 5.81]).

As increasing age has a recognized association with increased risk of cognitive disease, we applied age as a time scale for all survival analysis and Cox regression models (with cause-specific hazards function) to estimate the effect of AF on cognitive disease progression. A total of 401 out of 1690 with AF and 2701 out of 11993 without AF experienced cognition disease progression during the study follow-up. Figure 1 presents cumulative events of disease progression for subjects with AF and without AF, stratified by sex. Table 4 displays the estimated association between diagnostic progression and AF. After adjusting for demographic variables, AF is associated with faster disease progression in women (HR 1.15, 95% CI [1.01, 1.30]) compared to men (HR 0.93, 95% CI [0.82, 1.05]). However, after introducing clinical variables, this association becomes non-significant (HR 1.14, 95% CI [0.97, 1.33]) in women versus men (HR 0.89, 95% CI [0.77, 1.03]).

To understand the association between AF and different types of dementia, Table 5 shows estimated effects AF on transitions of cognitive diagnosis using multi-state modeling. After adjusting for age, sex, race, and education, women with AF are more likely to transition from normal cognition to MCI (HR 1.26, 95% CI [1.06, 1.50]) and from MCI to vascular dementia (HR 3.27, 95% CI [1.89, 5.65]) faster than women without AF. Overall, the results indicate that AF is significantly associated with faster disease progression in women with normal cognition at baseline.

The NACC data contained no variables regarding the temporal relationship between the diagnoses of stroke and AF; however, because of the recognized associations between AF and stroke and between stroke and cognitive disease, we considered that participants having either a history of stroke at baseline or MCI at baseline could be at higher risk to develop MCI and/or dementia over time. The Consort diagram for this second analysis is in Figure S2 and we had a total of 9,476 patients included in our survival analysis. Figure 2 presents this analysis (excluding those with baseline stroke and/or MCI) of the cumulative incidence of progression of cognitive disease against age for subjects with normal cognition at baseline stratified by AF status and sex. Tables S1 and S2 reflect the baseline demographics and cognitive test score results, respectively, from this subgroup analysis.

Table 4 displays the estimated association between diagnostic progression and AF in this subgroup. After adjusting for demographic variables, AF is associated with faster disease progression in women (HR 1.20, 95% CI [1.01, 1.44]) compared to men (HR 0.97, 95% CI [0.79, 1.2]). After introducing clinical variables, this association narrowed to (HR 1.23, 95% CI [1.00, 1.51]) in women versus men (HR 1.02, 95% CI [0.8, 1.28]).

We repeated the multi-state modeling analyses excluding subjects having a history of stroke and/or a diagnosis of MCI at baseline. These results are presented in Table 5. The previously statistically significant association of sex and AF and faster cognitive disease progression was now mitigated. The hazard ratio for normal to MCI is 1.28, 95% CI [1.07, 1.53] in women and 1.05, 95% CI [0.85, 1.28] in men. The hazard ratio from MCI to vascular dementia is 2.49, 95% CI [1.23, 5.02] in women and 1.35, 95% CI [0.56, 3.28] in men.

4. DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study using multisite data to examine sex differences in the trajectory of AF-associated cognitive disease progression. In this analysis of a large, well characterized clinical case series of older individuals with detailed neuropsychological assessments and specialized clinician diagnosis of cognitive status, we found in our initial analysis that women with AF are at significantly higher risk of MCI and dementia with more rapid disease progression to dementia than women without AF or men with and without AF. As baseline time-dependent relationships between stroke, AF, &amp; MCI were uncertain in the NACC data, causal relationships could not be ascertained for these diagnoses; therefore, we considered the group as a whole and subsequently controlled for stroke as a risk factor in our initial analysis. We did however, repeat the analyses excluding participants with baseline stroke and/or MCI and found that the prior significant effects of cognitive progression differences by sex were mitigated. One possibility is that we overestimated differences in AF-related cognitive progression by sex in our initial analytic approach by including subjects with baseline history of stroke and/or MCI. Alternatively in the second analyses by excluding those who were at the highest risk of cognitive disease, we may have underestimated the true risk of cognitive progression by sex. Further investigation with a larger sample size will be required to determine the true risk of cognitive progression in AF by sex.

Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for sex differences in AF and cognitive disease are not completely understood. One explanation for why AF could contribute to a higher risk of MCI and dementia progression in women could be related to the fact that on average, compared to men with AF, women with AF are older and more likely to have comorbidities that act as risk factors for cognitive disease. These include hypertension, valvular heart disease, and heart failure.44 A recent review of sex-related differences in AF concludes that, while women have a lower incidence and prevalence of AF, they have an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and death once AF is diagnosed.45 Women have been found to be at 20-30% greater risk for stroke than men even adjusting for differences in stroke risk factors and anticoagulation.46–48 When strokes do occur, women have a twofold increased risk of severe disabling or fatal ischemic stroke compared with men.49 Additionally, women with AF are significantly less likely than men to receive oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention.50 Women are therefore at increased risk of silent cerebral infarction51 and, possibly, cognitive decline when AF is present.

There are limited findings about overall sex differences in AF-associated cognitive disease and none of these specifically focused on sex differences in disease progression. Mielke and colleagues found significant association between cardiovascular risk factors such as AF and systolic hypertension and a more rapid rate of disease progression in incident dementia with these conditions, but no sex differences were analyzed in this report.52 Chang and colleagues reviewed sex-based differences in AF associated vascular cognitive impairment and the role of sex hormones on brain functioning.53 These researchers reported pathophysiological disease links between AF and vascular cognitive impairment identifying therapeutic targets for new interventions, but conclude that evidence on sex differences in rates of cognitive disease progression remains unclear. Golive and associates reported women with or without AF have higher rates of dementia over time versus men which they attributed to higher stroke rates and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors in women.54 Higher rates of dementia were reported in patients with AF compared to no AF; yet they found no sex-based differences in AF related dementia (0.4% versus 0.4%, p=0.88).54

Several meta-analyses have reported an association between AF and cognitive function, but none have analyzed differences by sex.5–7 Our findings are similar to those and other prior observational studies reporting not only increased prevalence of cognitive disease in patients with AF, but also faster progression of cognitive decline in patients with AF.1,2,8 Others have reported persistent AF is linked to lower cognitive function scores when compared to paroxysmal AF.3 We were unable to examine types of AF in our analyses because the NACC study did not include clinical variables about type of AF.

Unlike Bunch and colleagues8 who found that AF was independently linked to both vascular and AD-type dementia, we found AF to be significantly associated with vascular dementia but not AD-type dementia. There were discrepancies between the two studies’ samples that could explain some of these differences. Our study included a much older sample (mean age 78.5 years), whereas the Bunch and colleagues’ study had a larger sample (N=10,161) of younger AF patients (mean age 60.5 years).

In one cross-sectional study, Framingham Heart Study researchers examined domain specific AF-associated cognition and performance on neuropsychological testing scores in the Framingham Offspring cohort of men (mean age 61 years) with and without AF.55 Men with AF were found to have worse cognition in domains of global cognition, immediate and delayed memory, attention, and executive function than men without AF in normal sinus rhythm.55 Other Framingham researchers investigated whether longitudinal decline in cognitive function differed by the type of AF (new diagnosis or continuing prevalent). Both types of AF were found to be linked to a significantly greater decline in executive function after adjusting for covariates.34 They reported men with prevalent AF performed worse than women with AF on tests of abstract reasoning (lower scores on the Weschsler Adult Intelligence Tests Similarities [WAIS]) and executive function (higher scores on the Trail Making B test).34 As is presented in Table 3, we also found men with AF had significantly lower WAIS scores and higher scores on the Trail Making B test than women with AF. These findings have implications for our efforts towards successful management of AF in patients who may have cognitive dysfunction and whether they can comprehend patient education, adhere to medication regimens, and participate in shared decision-making discussions about their treatment.

The MoCA test is considered sensitive for vascular dementia, but this was only used in more recent data collected in NACC.56 The MMSE is less sensitive, but more specific for vascular dementia57 and was used more commonly in NACC. Further research should include either the MoCA or MMSE as well as other cognitive screening tests, such as the WAIS and Trail Making B tests, in routine clinical assessment of all individuals with AF, regardless of age and particularly in women.

Our findings of a trend of faster cognitive disease progression in women with AF when compared to men with AF have important implications for early identification of those who may be at highest risk of cognitive disease and prevention of stroke. Liao and colleagues propose use of the CHAD2DS2-VASc score to screen for and predict dementia in patients with AF after reporting significantly higher incidence of AF associated dementia in those who had higher CHAD2DS2-VASc scores with an adjusted HR 1.497, 95% CI (1.485-1.508).58 We were unable to include that in our study because the NACC study protocol did not include measurement of the CHAD2DS2-VASc score in those subjects with AF.

Our study has numerous strengths. A primary strength is that it is one of the first to describe differences by sex in the progression of AF associated cognitive disease. Another strength is the design of the NACC study with data collected from 38 sites across the country enrolling a diverse population of participants with numerous covariates and detailed cognitive testing with multiple measures. Additionally, we adjusted for many cardiovascular risk factors in our analyses that others have linked to cognitive disease.1,4,8,34,52 Limitations include the relatively small number of individuals with AF (compared to those without AF), and an inability to access clinical cardiac data not collected in the UDS pertaining to a temporal relationship between stroke and AF diagnoses, cause/type of stroke (ischemic vs hemorrhagic), length of time patients lived with AF, type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent), type of AF treatment patients were receiving in addition to antiarrhythmic medications, and AF medication adherence. The NACC participants were volunteers who likely had better cardiovascular health and levels of education than the general public which could also impact the generalizability of these findings. Participants in NACC are followed up as long as possible and the number of follow up years varies depending on the individual’s health status and re-location.

5. CONCLUSION

This is the first study to examine sex differences in rate of AF associated cognitive disease progression. Our findings imply that women with AF may be at higher risk of MCI and dementia with potentially more rapid disease progression from normal cognition to MCI or dementia than women without AF or men with and without AF. Analyses of sex differences in future trials of AF associated cognitive disease are critical to improve our understanding of how AF affects cognitive function in both women and men. Establishing ways to identify those patients with AF at highest risk of cognitive decline and stroke will inform future interventions to prevent or slow AF-associated MCI and ADRD.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review:

A PubMed database search was conducted to review literature regarding the association of atrial fibrillation (AF), risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’ disease and related dementias (ADRD) and whether there were differences in cognitive disease prevalence and progression by sex.

2. Interpretation:

Findings from a secondary analysis of National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) UDS data demonstrated that women with AF are at higher risk of MCI and dementia with a trend of more rapid progression to dementia than women without AF or men with or without AF.

3. Future directions:

Future studies addressing the relationship between AF and cognition should evaluate sex differences to improve our understanding of the link between these conditions in both men and women. Additionally, whether type of AF (paroxysmal, persistent, permanent), type of previous stroke, or type of AF treatment (drugs versus ablation) change this relationship should be considered in future studies.

HIGHLIGHTS

AF is associated with a decline in cognitive function.

Women with AF had a faster transition from normal cognition to MCI, and to mixed and vascular dementia.

These findings were not significant in women without AF or men with/without AF.
