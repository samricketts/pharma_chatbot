A high hippocampal volume polygenic predictor score (HV-PPS), computed based on GWAS summary statistics (n=33,536), could be protective against declines in brain volume and cognition in older adults. Linear mixed effects models with random intercepts and slopes were used to estimate associations of HV-PPS with baseline and annual rate of change in both brain volumes (n=508) and cognitive performance (n=1,041) in Caucasian Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants. Higher HV-PPS was associated with greater baseline volumes of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, and slower rates of ventricular enlargement and volume loss in frontal and parietal white-matter, all adjusted for intracranial volume. Additionally, higher HV-PPS was associated with better executive function performance and slower rates of decline in verbal fluency scores over time. Individuals with a genetic predisposition towards larger hippocampal volumes show better baseline executive function, slower decline in verbal fluency performance, and slower rates of longitudinal brain atrophy.

pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the only leading cause of death without a treatment or cure (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017). It is characterized by neuropathological and neurodegenerative changes that originate in the medial temporal lobe (Braak, 1993; Jack et al., 1997; Jobst et al., 1994; Pegueroles et al., 2017; Thal, Rüb, Orantes, &amp; Braak, 2002; Visser, Verhey, Hofman, Scheltens, &amp; Jolles, 2002). The hippocampus, located within the medial temporal lobe, is one of the first brain structures to show disease progression (Apostolova et al., 2006; C.R. Jack et al., 2000). Thus, hippocampal atrophy is considered to be a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of hippocampal atrophy have become a central component of the AD neuropathological cascade and are included in the “N” category of the “A/T/N” classification scheme (Jack et al., 2016). Further, lower baseline hippocampal volumes among cognitively normal older adults have been shown to predict longitudinal cognitive decline (Golomb et al., 1996; R. C. Petersen et al., 2000; Raz &amp; Rodrigue, 2006) and an increased risk of conversion to cognitive impairment (Apostolova et al., 2006; C. R. Jack et al., 2000; Raz &amp; Rodrigue, 2006). For that reason, individuals who have a high genetic risk for small hippocampal volumes could be at higher risk for neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive impairment.

Hippocampal volumes are highly heritable (h2~70%) (den Braber et al., 2013; Kremen et al., 2010; Rentería et al., 2014); thus, the genetic architecture of hippocampal volume has been the focus of many analyses. In the largest study to date, a GWAS meta-analysis of mean bilateral hippocampal volume was performed in 26,814 individuals of European ancestry, and six independent loci were identified as being associated with hippocampal volume (Hibar et al., 2017). Apart from these six independent loci, there were many variants with small effect sizes that did not meet genome-wide significance but may still contribute to the overall genetic architecture of hippocampal volume. Indeed, Hibar et al. (2017) estimated that nearly ~19% of the variance in hippocampal volume was explained by common variants across the whole-genome. For complex traits that are affected by many genetic variants with small effects, a polygenic score that incorporates information from all potential causal loci may be a more powerful method to determine genetic risk than simply examining loci that survive GWAS-level significance thresholds (Escott-Price et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2013; Ridge, Mukherjee, Crane, Kauwe, &amp; Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium, 2013). It is unknown whether genetic contributors to normal variation in hippocampal volumes are relevant to late-life risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Therefore, we sought to use a hippocampal volume polygenic predictor score (HV-PPS), based on results from the large meta-analysis of hippocampal volume by Hibar et al. (2017), to evaluate the late-life effects of these multiple identified genetic variants (Marden, Walter, Tchetgen Tchetgen, Kawachi, &amp; Glymour, 2014; Verhaaren et al., 2013).

In this study of older adults who are cognitively normal at baseline, we examine associations of the HV-PPS with baseline and change in brain volumes, general cognitive performance, and domain-specific cognitive performance up to 25 years. We hypothesize that higher HV-PPS will correlate with higher baseline and slower change in temporal lobe structures, especially areas affected by early AD pathology, i.e., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (Convit et al., 2000; Driscoll et al., 2009; Du et al., 2004; Galton et al., 2001). Change in brain gray matter volume is associated with change in cognition in older adults, with atrophy in temporal lobe gray matter being a strong predictor of longitudinal cognitive decline (Fletcher et al., 2018). Since there is a strong association between brain and behavior, we hypothesize that higher HV-PPS will also be associated with slower declines in cognitive performance, especially memory.

2. Methods

2.1. Characteristics of the Study Sample

This study included 1,041 Caucasian participants, aged ≥50 years, from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) who had both genome-wide genetic data and cognitive testing completed up to 2016. Supplementary Table 1 has the dates of test administration for each cognitive test. Test administration generally occurred biennially until 2003, although a subset of participants involved in the neuroimaging substudy received annual cognitive assessments from 1994–2004. Since 2003, participants aged 50–59 years had visits every four years, while those aged 60–79 years had biennial visits and those aged 80 and older had annual visits. There were 6,510 total observations. Of the 1,041 participants, there were 508 participants with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The procedures for determination of subsequent cognitive impairment (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] or dementia/AD) have been detailed previously (S. Resnick, Pham, Kraut, Zonderman, &amp; Davatzikos, 2003). Research diagnoses of cognitive impairment were determined using consensus case conference procedures. MCI was determined by Petersen criteria (R. Petersen, 2004). Dementia and AD, respectively, were based on DSM-III-R criteria (Millon, 1981) and the NINCDS-Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (McKhann et al., 1984). The study protocol for both studies were reviewed and approved by the Internal Review Board of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences and all participants provided written informed consent.

2.2. GWAS Genotyping and Processing

Participants were genotyped on either the Illumina 550K or NeuroChip (Blauwendraat et al., 2017). All genotype data were on Build 37, and they went through the same genotyping quality control (QC) and imputation pipeline (Supplementary Figure 1). Variants were filtered for poor call rate (missing&gt;1%), for violations of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p&gt;1×10−6), and for minor allele frequency (&lt;1%). Samples were excluded for poor genotyping efficiency (missing&gt;2%), sex inconsistences, cryptic relatedness (pihat&gt;0.25), or if they were not Caucasian by self-report or by principal component detection. Imputation was then performed on each individual dataset by the Michigan Imputation Server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/) using the HRC r1.1.2016 reference panel (Das et al., 2016). Post-imputation, the two datasets were merged, overlapping samples were removed (as some participants were genotyped on both platforms), and SNPs with low imputation quality (R2&lt;0.9), minor allele frequencies &lt;1%, and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium p-values &lt;1×10−6 were excluded, along with SNPs that did not overlap between the two datasets (missingness &lt;99%). The final genetic dataset included 5,439,477 SNPs and 1184 individuals, of which 1041 and 508 individuals also had cognitive assessments and neuroimaging data, respectively. BLSA data were not included in the ENIGMA consortium.

2.3. Computation of the Hippocampal Volume Polygenic Predictor Score

The HV-PPS was generated in PLINK (Chang et al., 2015) (www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/) using summary results from a published hippocampal volume GWAS (Hibar et al., 2017), which included 26,814 individuals of European ancestry with mean bilateral hippocampal volume. Prior to score calculation, all strand-ambiguous SNPs and SNPs absent from the BLSA cohort were removed. SNPs were then pruned using PLINK’s linkage disequilibrium based clumping procedure based on: an r2&gt;0.25, a 200-kb sliding window, and a hippocampal volume GWAS association p-value&lt;0.01. We selected a p-value threshold of 0.01 following Mormino et al. (2016). A total of 12,148 SNPs was included in the final score. HV-PPS were then calculated for each individual by summing the reference allele counts at each SNP weighted by the beta from the hippocampal volume GWAS. Polygenic predictor scores were calculated both including and excluding the APOE region (i.e., 1 MB upstream and downstream of the gene; chr19:44409039–46412650).

2.4. Cognitive Assessments

We assessed the composite z-scores of memory, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, and visuospatial domains. Z-scores were created using the baseline means and standard deviations of each neuropsychological test score. Memory consisted of the immediate and long-delayed free recall scores from the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 1987). The delay time on the CVLT was approximately 20 minutes. Executive function consisted of completion time for Trail-Making Test Part B (TMT-B) (Reitan, 1958) and the total score from Digit Span Backward (Wechsler, 1981). Attention was comprised of TMT Part A (TMT-A) (Reitan, 1958) and Digit Span Forward (Wechsler, 1981). Completion times of TMT-A and TMT-B were truncated at 300 seconds. Due to the distributions of TMT-A and TMT-B, we log-transformed the completion times, standardized these tests, and reversed the signs so that higher scores reflected better performance. The composite for verbal fluency consisted of the total numbers of correct words generated in 60 seconds for the letter (Benton, 1968) and category fluency (Newcombe, 1969) tests. Visuospatial composite consisted of a modified version of the Educational Testing Service Card Rotations test (Wilson et al., 1975), based on the total number correct minus total number incorrect and the Clock Drawing Test (Rouleau, Salmon, Butters, Kennedy, &amp; McGuire, 1992), using times of 11:10 and 3:25. A global composite score was created from the average z-scores of all domains. All tests were administered by highly trained psychometricians at each study visit.

2.5. Image Acquisition

MRI scanning was performed on a General Electric (GE) Signa 1.5-T scanner (Milwaukee, WI) or a 3-T Philips Achieva. GE 1.5-T scans used a high-resolution volumetric spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in a steady state (GRASS) series (axial acquisition, repetition time=35msec, echo time=5msec, flip angle=45°, field of view=24 cm, matrix=256×256, number of excitations=1, voxel dimensions=0.94×0.94×1.5 mm slice thickness). T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scans were acquired on a 3-T Philips Achieva (repetition time [TR]=6.8msec, echo time [TE]=3.2msec, flip angle=8°, image matrix=256×256, 170 slices, pixel size=1×1mm, slice thickness=1.2mm). There were 156 participants (472 scans) with 3-T MPRAGE images and 111 participants (854 scans) with 1.5-T SPGR images at baseline with available GWAS data. Participants receiving 1.5-T scans comprised enrollees in the original BLSA neuroimaging substudy dating back to 1994 (S. M. Resnick et al., 2000).

2.6. Harmonization of MUSE Anatomical Labels across 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T MPRAGE

A new automated labeling method specifically designed to achieve a consistent parcellation of brain anatomy in longitudinal MRI studies with scanner and imaging protocol differences was used to harmonize BLSA MRI data. This method combines the MUSE anatomical labeling approach (Doshi et al., 2016) with harmonized acquisition-specific atlases (Erus et al., 2018). The approach is described in more detail in Erus et al. (2018). Briefly, using 35 labeled 3-T MPRAGE brain MRIs from the OASIS data set (available for download at https://masi.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/workshop2012) as atlases, we first performed the MUSE labeling method on 3-T MPRAGE images for 32 BLSA participants with 1.5-T SPGR at an earlier time point. Then, for each participant, we deformably registered their 1.5-T SPGR image to their 3-T MPRAGE image using a robust registration strategy that combines an ensemble of registrations obtained using two different algorithms and multiple smoothness parameters. From these steps, we obtained 32 pairs of 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T MPRAGE images in the same space with common anatomical labels, which served as atlases in the MUSE approach to obtain labels on the entire BLSA collection of 1.5-T SPGR and 3-T MPRAGE images. This workflow for anatomical labeling has been extensively validated on BLSA MRI data (Erus et al., 2018), and the harmonized values were used in previous studies (Armstrong et al., 2019a; Armstrong et al., 2019b).

2.7. Regions of Interest

First, we examined global regions, i.e., total brain, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and ventricles, and lobar GM and WM (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital). Then, we examined volumes in medial temporal regions previously reported to show early neurodegeneration in AD (Convit et al., 2000; Driscoll et al., 2009; Du et al., 2004; Galton et al., 2001). These regions of interest (ROIs) were hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus.

2.8. Statistical Analyses

Means for continuous covariates and frequencies for categorical covariates were reported for the overall sample. Linear mixed effects models with unstructured variance-covariance were used to examine the association of the HV-PPS with baseline and change in volumes in brain ROIs and cognitive performance (general and domain-specific). These models also included the fixed effects of mean-centered baseline age, sex (male vs. female), years of education, subsequent impaired status (vs. cognitively normal), time since baseline and the following two-way interactions: age*time and sex*time. For brain volume analyses, we further adjusted for the fixed effects of mean-centered intracranial volume (ICV) at age 70 and image type (1.5-T SPGR vs. 3-T MPRAGE) (Erus et al., 2018). For the cognitive analysis, baseline was defined as the first cognitive assessment once the participant was at least 50 years of age. Cognitive assessments prior to age 50 were excluded. We excluded array platform (Illumina 550K or NeuroChip) as a covariate, since estimates did not change with the inclusion of this covariate in either analysis. Also, HV-PPS scores were not associated with genotyping platform (p=0.75 using generalized linear models) (Supplementary Figure 2).

To allow for baseline and slope differences between individuals, we included random intercepts and slopes for time. All analyses were performed in SAS (Cary, NC) or R version 3.4.1 (https://www.r-project.org/). We examined the collinearity of baseline hippocampal volume and HV-PPS through variance inflation factors (VIFs) to determine whether baseline hippocampal volume could be added to the models. The VIFs were estimated in multivariable linear regression models with ventricular size and WM volumes as outcomes and HV-PPS as a predictor. These models were adjusted by ICV at 70, scanner type, education, mean-centered baseline age, sex, subsequent impaired status and baseline hippocampal volume. Type I error level was set to 0.05 for analyses, although with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons for the 6 cognitive domains and 15 ROIs, results would be considered significant at p&lt;0.008 and p&lt;0.003 respectively. Three-way interactions were considered significant at p&lt;0.10.

2.9. Sensitivity Analyses

We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses for each outcome. Analyses were re-run with HV-PPS excluding the APOE region. Additionally, analyses were re-run excluding all participants who developed cognitive impairment during the follow-up period. We also compared the HV-PPS with clumping parameters r2&gt;0.1 with 1MB sliding window to the HV-PPS used in the main analysis to see if inferences remained.

3. Results

3.1. Characteristics of the study sample

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study sample (N=1,041). There were 578 (55.5%) females and 237 (22.8%) participants who developed cognitive impairment during follow-up. Mean baseline age was 68.3 (Standard Deviation, [SD]=9.3) years, and mean length of follow-up was 15.0 (SD=7.2) years. The mean years of education were 16.5 (SD=2.5) years. There were 508 participants who also had serial MRI assessments (n=2,018). Of these, 84 (16.5%) developed cognitive impairment. Characteristics of the subsample with MRI assessments were similar to those of the overall sample with the exception of follow-up time (Table 1). The mean follow-up time for the MRI subsample was 4.7 (SD=5.1) years.

3.2. Associations of hippocampal volume polygenic predictor score with baseline and change in brain volumes

Table 2 shows the associations of the HV-PPS with baseline and change in brain volume. As expected, greater HV-PPS was associated with greater baseline hippocampal volume (estimate=0.1616, SE=0.0292, p&lt;0.0001), which survived Bonferroni correction. Figure 1 shows the association between HV-PPS and hippocampal volume. Greater HV-PPS also was associated with greater baseline volumes in parahippocampal gyrus (estimate=0.0826, SE=0.0265, p=0.0020). In longitudinal analyses, HV-PPS was associated with slower annual rates of change of ventricles and WM regions, as shown in Figure 2. Greater HV-PPS was associated with slower rates of ventricular dilation (estimate=−0.1407, SE=0.0460, p=0.0024) and slower rates of WM atrophy (estimate=0.1854, SE=0.0696, p=0.0090), specifically in the frontal WM (estimate=0.0738, SE=0.0293, p=0.0132) and parietal WM (estimate=0.0475, SE=0.0170, p=0.0062). Greater HV-PPS was associated with slower rates of GM volumetric decline (estimate=0.3059, SE=0.1382, p=0.0280), but this did not survive Bonferroni correction.

Secondary analyses (covarying for both baseline hippocampal volume and baseline hippocampal volume*time interaction) indicated that these associations with HV-PPS were independent of baseline hippocampal volume (Supplementary Table 2). After baseline hippocampal volume adjustment, HV-PPS was no longer associated with greater baseline parahippocampal gyrus volumes (estimate=0.0058, SE=0.0238, p=0.81). Additionally, greater HV-PPS was associated with slower rates of volume loss in total GM (estimate=0.3129, SE=0.1383, p=0.0237). Furthermore, there was no evidence of collinearity among HV-PPS and baseline hippocampal volume (VIF=1.04).

3.3. Associations of hippocampal volume polygenic predictor score with baseline and change in cognitive performance

Table 3 contains the results from the associations of HV-PPS with cognitive performance. Higher HV-PPS was associated with better baseline executive function performance (estimate=0.0458, SE=0.0212, p=0.031), but not with change in executive function performance. While HV-PPS was not associated with baseline verbal fluency scores, higher HV-PPS was associated with slower rates of decline in verbal fluency scores over time (estimate=0.0048, SE=0.0018, p=0.0071). No other cognitive associations were observed, including null associations with memory performance (Table 3).

3.4. Sensitivity Analyses

To preclude any influence of the APOE gene, SNPs 1MB upstream and downstream of the APOE locus were excluded from the HV-PPS, and analyses were repeated. All associations excluding the APOE region, whether with brain volumes or cognitive performance, were similar to those including the APOE region (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Analyses were also restricted to those who remained cognitively normal. Inferences did not change (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). For the comparison between the HV-PPS with clumping parameters r2&gt;0.1 with 1MB sliding window to the HV-PPS used in the main analysis, cross-sectional association between HV-PPS and baseline executive function was no longer significant, yet the results for verbal fluency still held (Supplementary Table 7).

4. Discussion

As expected, higher HV-PPS, regardless of inclusion or exclusion of APOE region, was associated with greater baseline hippocampal volumes, validating the integrity of the predictor score in our sample. Additionally, in support of our cross-sectional hypotheses, HV-PPS was associated with higher volumes in parahippocampal gyrus, a structure affected by early AD pathology. We found that higher HV-PPS was related to slower rates of ventricular dilation and volume loss in frontal and parietal WM in the overall sample, but there were no significant longitudinal associations between HV-PPS and change in temporal lobe structures. Regarding the associations between HV-PPS and domain-specific cognition, our hypotheses that HV-PPS was associated with memory were not supported. Higher HV-PPS was associated with higher executive function cross-sectionally and slower longitudinal rates of decline in verbal fluency.

The associations of greater HV-PPS with higher volumes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus highlights the specificity of the score in relation to the medial temporal lobe. The hippocampus has extensive connections with neighboring cortical areas, i.e., perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex, for memory-guided behavior (Ranganath &amp; Ritchey, 2012). The parahippocampal cortex is part of the posterior medial system, which includes the retrosplenial cortex, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and angular gyrus among other regions (Ranganath &amp; Ritchey, 2012). There were no other baseline associations between HV-PPS and other volumes of interest.

In contrast, the associations of greater HV-PPS with slower rates of declines in ventricular size and WM, especially frontal and parietal WM, in the overall sample highlight that HV-PPS may reflect a protective effect, independent of baseline hippocampal volumes. Ventricular size is a well-established indicator of global atrophy, including in BLSA data from cognitively normal older adults (Resnick et al., 2000), and is highly sensitive to age. HV-PPS effect on WM may reflect the broad WM connections between cortical regions that support cognitive performance. However, more detailed WM measures are needed to further elucidate the tracts underlying the observed associations. HV-PPS was not associated with GM after correction for multiple comparisons. These findings suggest that genetic predictors of hippocampal volume at midlife are predictive of global age-related atrophy outside of the medial temporal lobe. Notably, these global associations are not dependent on baseline hippocampal volume, suggesting pleiotropic effects of HV-PPS on brain structures.

Regarding cognitive performance, higher HV-PPS was associated with higher baseline executive function performance and slower rates of decline in verbal fluency. HV-PPS was not significantly associated with memory, although the magnitude of the estimate was positive. The association between higher HV-PPS and both executive function performance and change over time in frontal and parietal volumes may reflect established relationships between executive function and WM volumes (Bennett &amp; Madden, 2014; Madden et al., 2012). Additionally, signal abnormalities in WM are most often related to poorer performance on measures of executive function (Gunning-Dixon &amp; Raz, 2000). In terms of the association between HV-PPS and verbal fluency performance, we have shown that verbal fluency performance is associated with volumes of many brain regions, including the hippocampus, reflecting the fact that many different cognitive functions contribute to verbal fluency (Armstrong et al., 2019).

The HV-PPS score may be useful in elucidating contributors to brain reserve. Brain reserve is defined by having higher neuronal or synaptic counts (Stern, 2009), which may allow an individual to withstand more severe disease pathology to prolong the preclinical stage of AD until a critical threshold is reached (Satz, Cole, Hardy, &amp; Rassovsky, 2011). Presumably, individuals who have greater brain reserve have larger brain volumes, more neurons, and/or elaborate synaptic networks that serve as protection from cognitive decline (Katzman et al., 1988; Satz, 1993; Stern, 2002; Whalley, Deary, Appleton, &amp; Starr, 2004). Genetic variation could play a role in brain reserve, and our findings suggest that the HV-PPS not only predicts volumes of hippocampal and related structures that are affected in early AD, but also may be protective against some aspects of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. A future direction would be to compare the rates of change in hippocampal volume between young and older adults, since this may have further implications on brain reserve.

There were several strengths and limitations of the study. This study consists of an extensively characterized sample of older adults with repeated measures. Second, our image processing pipeline uses state-of-the-art and validated multi-atlas approaches for regional definition, yielding high measurement stability over time. However, our sample is highly educated, relatively healthy, and Caucasian, thus limiting generalizability. Other limitations include relatively low sample size and the absence of replication.

In conclusion, our findings indicate that higher HV-PPS was associated with greater baseline volumes in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, yet it was not associated with change in these brain volumes over time. Thus, genetic loading for greater hippocampal volume may have a protective effect on overall level of hippocampal volume and may help maintain volume over time. Additionally, the HV-PPS was associated with slower rates of decline in verbal fluency over time in cognitively normal older adults. Our findings should motivate additional research to determine the contribution of the HV-PPS to the brain reserve hypothesis.

Figure 2. Longitudinal associations of time on study with ventricles and frontal and parietal white matter (WM) by standard deviations of hippocampal volume polygenic predictor score (HV-PPS)

Note: HV-PPS categories mean the following: −1 is one standard deviation below the mean Z-score for the HV-PPS; 0 is the mean Z-score for HV-PPS; 1 is one standard deviation above the mean Z-score for HV-PPS. All analyses are adjusted by baseline mean-centered age, sex, subsequent cognitive impairment status, years of education, mean-centered intracranial volume at age 70, image type (3-T vs. 1.5-T images) and two-way interactions of age and sex with time. Those with one standard deviation above the mean Z-score had greater frontal and parietal white matter volumes and less declines over time as well as lower ventricular size and less steep ventricular enlargement over time, as compared to the other two groups.

Highlights

Higher HV-PPS predicts larger hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus volumes.

Higher HV-PPS predicts slower declines in white matter (WM) and verbal fluency.

Higher HV-PPS predicts slower rates of ventricular enlargement (VE).

Higher HV-PPS predicts higher baseline executive function.

Association of HV-PPS with WM and VE change were independent of hippocampal volume.
