Importance

Cerebral microbleeds are hypothesized downstream markers of brain damage caused by both vascular and amyloid pathological mechanisms. To date, it remains unclear whether their presence if associated with cognitive deterioration in the general population.

Objective

To determine whether microbleeds, and more specifically microbleed count and location, associate with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in the general population.

Design

Prospective population-based Rotterdam Study.

Setting

General community.

Participants

In the Rotterdam Study, we assessed presence, number, and location of microbleeds at baseline (2005–2011) on brain MRI of 4,841 participants aged ≥45 years. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing at two time points on average 5.9 years (SD 0.6) apart, and were followed for incident dementia throughout the study period until 2013. The association of microbleeds with cognitive decline and dementia was studied using multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects modeling, and Cox proportional hazards.

Exposure

cerebral microbleed presence, location, and number.

Main outcomes

cognitive decline and dementia.

Results

Microbleed prevalence was 15.3% (median count 1 [1–88]). Presence of &gt;4 microbleeds associated with cognitive decline. Lobar (with or without cerebellar) microbleeds were associated with decline in executive functions, information processing, and memory function, whereas microbleeds in other brain regions were associated with decline in information processing and motor speed. After mean follow-up of 4.8 years (SD 1.4), 72 people developed dementia, of whom 53 had Alzheimer’s disease. Presence of microbleeds was associated with an increased risk of dementia (age, sex, education adjusted HR 2.02, 95%CI 1.25;3.24), including Alzheimer’s dementia (HR 2.10, 95%CI 1.21;3.64).

Conclusions and relevance

In the general population, a high microbleed count associated with an increased risk of cognitive deterioration and dementia. Microbleeds thus mark the presence of diffuse vascular and neurodegenerative brain damage.


Introduction

With increasing life expectancy, societies are facing a major public health challenge as the number of people living with cognitive impairments and dementia are growing steadily. There is a growing need to identify early etiological markers of cognitive impairment and dementia, since timely implementation of preventive strategies is key to positively influence the disease course. Accumulating evidence suggests that vascular pathology has a central role in cognitive deterioration.1 Studies that have investigated pathological changes of cerebral small vessels emphasized a potential role for these vessels in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and dementia.2–4 Arteriosclerosis and amyloid angiopathy are leading causes of cerebral small vessel disease. Consequences of small vessel disease on brain parenchyma can be visualized by neuroimaging. These lesions can either be ischemic (lacunes, white matter lesions) or hemorrhagic (cerebral microbleeds). While the underlying pathogenic cascade of lacunes and white matter lesions mainly revolves around vascular risk factors (i.e., chronic hypertension, smoking, diabetes),5 microbleed pathogenesis involves vessel wall damage due to both vascular risk factors and accumulation of beta-amyloid.6 As such, it has been suggested that microbleeds may help explain the overlap between cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative pathology in cognitive dysfunction and dementia.

While microbleeds do not appear to affect the rate of cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer’s disease,7 it remains unclear whether microbleeds play a role in cognitive deterioration in non-cognitively impaired individuals. This is mainly due to the lack of longitudinal data and the heterogeneity of cognitive tests used in previous studies. Thus far, cross-sectional studies in the general population showed that a high microbleed count associated with lower scores on MMSE and on tests sensitive to executive function, processing speed, and motor function.8–11 Studies in patients with cerebrovascular disease report inconsistent results, with some reporting only associations between microbleeds and global cognition, and others also between microbleeds and specific cognitive domains.12–15 To date, it also remains unclear whether community-dwelling elderly with microbleeds are at increased risk of dementia, and more particularly Alzheimer’s disease. Should microbleeds relate to Alzheimer’s dementia, it would highlight the role of vascular pathology in the etiology of the disease and build a bridge between the vascular and amyloid hypothesis.

In the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study, we studied whether presence, number and location of microbleeds marks decline of cognitive functioning, and associates with an increased risk of dementia.

Methods

Study population

This study was conducted in the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study.16 After its start in 1990, a total of 7,983 people were included in the initial study wave. In 1999, the cohort was expanded with 3,011 participants, and in 2006 again with 3,932 participants. The total of 14,926 participants enrolled, were invited to undergo home interviews and various physical and laboratory examination at the research center every 4 years. Of these, 5,074 (88.5% of invitees) non-demented participants without MRI contra-indication underwent brain MRI between 2005 and 2011 (considered as baseline for this study) for the assessment of microbleeds.17 We excluded participants if scans were incomplete or of inadequate quality (n=129). In addition, we excluded 56 participants with insufficient screening for dementia, and 48 participants for whom follow-up for incident dementia ended before date of MRI due to the absence of automatic linkage between the general practitioners office and our study database. In total, 4,841 participants were included in the dementia analysis. Of these, 3,257 participants (without prevalent or incident dementia) underwent both baseline and follow-up cognitive testing, and were included in the analysis of cognitive decline. Baseline cognition was assessed during the research visit closest to MRI date (2002–2008) and reassessed at a subsequent visit (2009–2014). Follow-up cognitive tests were unavailable for participants who underwent baseline brain MRI between 2009 and 2011. The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC and by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport of the Netherlands, implementing the “Wet Bevolkingsonderzoek: ERGO (Population Studies Act: Rotterdam Study)”. All participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study and to obtain information from their treating physicians.

Brain MRI and markers of small vessel disease

Participants were scanned on a 1.5-T MRI scanner (GE Healthcare Milwaukee, WI) using a multisequence protocol consistent of T1-weighted, proton density weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2*-weighted sequences.17 Trained research physicians, blinded to clinical data, reviewed the MR images. Cerebral microbleeds were defined as small, round to ovoid areas of focal signal loss on T2*-weighted images. Intra-observer (k=0.87) and inter-observer agreement (k=0.85) were good.6 Microbleeds were classified manually as lobar microbleeds with or without cerebellar microbleeds (suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy), and deep or infratentorial microbleeds with or without lobar microbleeds (suggestive of hypertensive arteriopathy). In addition, we classified every microbleed according to its topographic distribution in the brain (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe, infratentorial, and deep). The topographic categorization of microbleeds was done semi-automatically, as described previously.18 In short, after microbleeds were manually labeled, automated lobe segmentation was done by nonrigid registration of 6 manually annotated lobe atlases to the participant under investigation using the Elastix software. Lobe segmentations were combined with the manually labeled microbleeds, to determine the lobar distribution of microbleeds. Infarcts were defined as focal lesions with the same signal intensity as cerebrospinal fluid on all sequences. Infarcts ≥3 and &lt;15mm in size were classified as lacunes, infarcts ≥15 mm as subcortical infarcts, and infarcts involving cortical gray matter as cortical infarcts. Brain tissue was segmented into gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid using automated post-processing tools that included conventional k-nearest-neighbor brain tissue classifier extended with white matter lesion segmentation.19 Intracranial volume was defined the sum of cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter white matter, and white matter lesion.

Assessment of cognitive functioning

The neuropsychological test battery comprised the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), letter-digit-substitution task (LDST), word fluency test (WFT), Stroop test (consisting of reading, color-naming, and interference subtask), 15-word verbal learning test (15-WLT) and Purdue Pegboard test.20 We computed compound scores for global cognition (average Z-score of the Stroop interference subtask, LDST, WFT, delayed recall of the 15-WLT, and Purdue Pegboard), executive functioning (average Z-score of Stroop interference subtask, LDST, WFT), information-processing speed (average Z-score of Stroop reading and color-naming subtask, and LDST), memory (average Z-score of immediate and delayed recall of the 15-WLT), and motor speed (average Z-score of Purdue Pegboard).

Assessment of dementia

A three-step protocol was used to screen for prevalent and incident dementia. All participants underwent the MMSE and the Geriatric Mental Schedule (GMS) organic level. Those who screened positive on either test, MMSE &lt;26 or GMS organic level &gt;0, also underwent an examination and informant interview with the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders in the Elderly. Those allegedly suffering from dementia underwent further neuropsychological testing if necessary. In addition, all participants were continuously monitored for dementia by linking the study database to digitized medical records from general practitioners and the Regional Institute for Outpatient Mental Health Care. If available, clinical neuroimages were used in the diagnostic process. The final diagnosis was made in accordance with international criteria and determined by a consensus panel led by a neurologist.21,22 Follow-up for incident dementia was complete until January 1st, 2013, for 23177 (98.5%) of potential person-years.

Assessment of covariates

Covariates were assessed during the same visit in which baseline cognition was tested. Blood pressure was measured in two readings using a random zero sphygmomanometer in sitting position, and both measures were averaged. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mmHg, or the use of blood pressure-lowering medication. Serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured using an automated enzymatic procedure. Smoking behavior was classified as “ever” versus “never” smoked. People were considered diabetic when fasting blood glucose levels were ≥7.0 mmol/L or when they used glucose-lowering medication. Medication use (glucose-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and lipid-lowering medication) and education level was assessed during home visits by standardized interviews. APOE genotyping was performed on coded genomic DNA samples. Distribution of APOE genotype and allele frequencies in this population were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

Statistical analysis

We investigated the association of microbleed presence, location, and number (a priori defined categories of 1, 2–4, &gt;4 microbleeds) with cognitive decline and dementia, using people without microbleeds as a reference group.

We first used multiple linear regression to investigate the association of microbleeds with cognitive decline. We examined microbleeds in relation to individual neuropsychological tests and afterwards with specific cognitive domains. Z-scores of baseline and follow-up cognitive tests were calculated for each participant. Decline in cognitive scores was studied by using cognitive scores at follow-up as dependent variable and adjusting for baseline test scores in the linear regression models.

Second, we used linear mixed models with added random effects to determine the relationship between microbleed count per topographic distribution in the brain and cognitive decline in specific domains.

Third, Cox proportional hazards were used to study the relation between microbleeds and dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. These analyses were also censored for stroke.

All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and education. Additionally, regression models were adjusted for APOE ε4, a propensity score of cardiovascular risk (hypertension, total and HDL cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, lipid-lowering and antithrombotic medication use), intracranial volume and other imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (lacunes and white matter lesions). Lacunes were modeled dichotomously. White matter lesions load was naturally transformed because of its skewed distribution and modeled continuously. Missing covariate data (≤7.0%) were imputed based on age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors using regression models. Afterwards, logistic regression was used to compute propensity scores for cardiovascular risk. Here, microbleed status (yes versus no) was defined the dependent variable and the above-mentioned cardiovascular risk factors were considered independent covariates. The estimated propensity score was the derived predicted value of the equation. Finally, we also investigated whether adjustments for age-squared would give a better adjustment for confounding by age.

Participants with unreliable segmentations of white matter lesions volume (n=127) were excluded in the analysis involving white matter lesion volume.

Results

Microbleeds and cognitive decline

In total, 3,257 participants (mean age 59.6 years (SD 7.8), 54.7% women) without prevalent or incident dementia underwent baseline and repeat cognitive testing on average 5.9 years apart (Table 1). The prevalence of lobar microbleeds (with or without cerebellar microbleeds) and deep or infratentorial microbleeds (with or without lobar microbleeds) was respectively 10.9% and 3.8%. The topographic distribution of cerebral microbleeds was as follows: 5.3 % had at least 1 microbleeds in frontal lobe, 5.5% in temporal lobe, 5.1% in parietal lobe, 3.4% in occipital lobe, 3.2% in infratentorial regions, and 3.5% in deep hemispheric regions.

Compared with no microbleeds, the presence of any microbleeds did not associate with decline in cognition. We did, however, observe that the presence of more than 4 microbleeds was associated with worse performance on LDST, WFT, Stroop reading and naming, immediate WLT, and Purdue Pegboard neuropsychological testing during follow-up. Furthermore, presence of multiple lobar microbleeds specifically associated with worse performance on WFT, Stroop reading and naming, and immediate WLT. Presence of multiple deep or infratentorial microbleeds associated with worse performance on Purdue Pegboard (Table 2). In accordance, lobar microbleeds were the strongest determinant for decline in information processing speed, whereas deep or infratentorial microbleeds were most strongly associated with decline in motor speed (Figure). Adjusting for APOE ε4 and cardiovascular risk factors weakened the associations of lobar microbleeds with various cognitive domains. Additionally, the association between deep or infratentorial microbleeds and information processing speed was no longer significant. Lobar microbleeds associated with decline in executive functioning and information processing speed even after correcting for other imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (Table 3). The additional adjustment for age-squared did not change any of the results.

Regarding the topographic distribution of cerebral microbleeds, microbleeds in distinct anatomical brain regions associated non-specifically with decline in various cognitive domains (Supplementary Table 1).

Microbleeds and dementia

Follow-up for dementia was complete in 4,841 participants (50.0% women, mean age 63.8 years) (Table 1). During a mean follow-up of 4.8 years (SD 1.4), 72 participants developed dementia, of whom 53 had Alzheimer’s dementia. The presence of microbleeds, both lobar and deep or infratentorial microbleeds, was associated with an increased risk of dementia (age, sex, and education adjusted HR for dementia in people with any microbleeds 2.02, 95% CI 1.25;3.24) (Table 4). Associations remained after censoring for stroke (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.00;2.87). Lobar and deep or infratentorial microbleeds associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s dementia in the same magnitude as that of non-Alzheimer’s dementia. Significance was lost after adjusting for APOE ε4 carriership and cardiovascular risk (Table 4, model II) Associations, however, remained for deep or infratentorial microbleeds, after adjusting for other imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (Table 4, model III).

Discussion

In this population-based study of middle-aged and elderly people we found that a high microbleed count (i.e., &gt;4 microbleeds) was associated with cognitive decline. Also, presence of microbleeds was associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Presence of multiple microbleeds affected cognition in all domains in our population-based study. Previous cross-sectional studies in healthy adults already demonstrated that microbleeds, especially in large numbers, are related to lower MMSE scores, worse information processing, and worse executive functioning.8–11 The only study that investigated the relationship between microbleeds and cognitive decline longitudinally was performed in patients with the genetic small vessel disease, CADASIL.23 That study found similar results for decline in global cognition, executive function, and memory, but did not investigate this separately for different microbleed locations. Cross-sectional studies in patients with or at increased risk of cerebrovascular disease reported inconsistent results on the associations of microbleeds with worse performance on global cognition, tests for executive function, tests for memory function, and tests for psychomotor speed.12–15 In addition, in memory clinic populations microbleeds associated with worse MMSE scores (as measure for global cognition) and several cognitive domains with exception of language skills.24,25 although the majority of studies were unable to demonstrate any association.26–29

Mechanisms by which microbleeds influence cognitive function remain speculative, and may either be causal or non-causal.30 Microbleeds located strategically in the brain may cause focal damage to neurological tracts leading to impairment in specific cognitive domains.14 On the other hand, microbleeds may represent a proxy measure of cerebral vascular pathology at large, and their presence may influence cognition indirectly. The latter hypothesis is supported by our findings as we found associations with multiple microbleeds in widespread areas, rather than with single or multiple microbleeds clustered in a specific brain region. In addition, microbleeds in non-strategic topographic brain regions associated with impairments in executive functioning, information processing, and memory. Also, these associations were attenuated after adjusting for white matter lesions and lacunes, indicating that these lesions have a shared effect on cognition. Indeed, previous evidence also suggest that these lesions often co-exist, share risk factors, and even that their presence indicates a single pathological continuum.31–36 Microbleeds may less likely be a sole causal determinant of cognitive deterioration but rather a downstream product of both severe vascular and neurodegenerative pathology.

Lobar microbleeds were associated with decline in distinct cognitive domains when compared with microbleeds in other locations. The association of lobar microbleeds with memory might partly be explained by the fact that multiple lobar microbleeds had a predilection for the temporal lobes in our study.37 In turn, deep or infratentorial microbleeds could strategically affect infratentorial and deep hemispheric brain regions (including basal ganglia and the internal capsule) to influence motor function. It should be noted, however, that participants with deep or infratentorial microbleeds often had a higher microbleed count and more often had mixed microbleeds (i.e., microbleeds in lobar and non-lobar brain regions). Hence, microbleed count per topographic brain regions may be more informative than the categorizations per presumed underlying vasculopathy in assessing cognitive deterioration.

Microbleeds are found in 18–32% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease,38 with most patients exhibiting a predominance for cortical-subcortical microbleeds.27 In the general population, we found that microbleeds related to an increased risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. We found strong associations for deep or infratentorial microbleeds. Our study underscores the role of vascular pathology in the pathogenesis of dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. The question remains how vascular pathology interacts with amyloid pathology to cause clinical cognitive deterioration and dementia. In principle, the relationship could move in two directions: either vascular amyloid deposition adversely affects reactivity of cerebral microvasculature causing loss of function with ischemic and hemorrhagic damage, or hypertensive damage to small vessels leads to disturbances in amyloid clearance, increasing the amyloid deposits in vessel walls.38 Accumulating evidence suggests that vascular damage may be of particular importance in the initiation of neurodegenerative disease whereas the influence of b-amyloid becomes more prominent in the clinical disease stage.39,40

Strengths of our study include the longitudinal population-based design with large sample size, the use of an extensive neuropsychological test battery, and the virtually complete screening for incident dementia. Some limitations of our study also have to be mentioned. First, we applied multiple statistical tests in our study, increasing the chance of type I errors. However, correcting for multiple testing seems inappropriate since cognitive tests/domains were not independent from one another, and microbleeds in different locations are correlated. Second, selection bias may have influenced our results, as healthier people without subjective memory complains were more likely to receive follow-up cognitive testing. This would most likely have biased our results towards the null. Third, the microbleed number rated may not reflect the true biological number since microbleed detection strongly depends on technical imaging methods used. Fourth, the small number of incident dementia cases in our relatively young cohort hampered our ability to control for all potential confounders, and residual confounding may have affected our results. Specifically, residual confounding by age may have biased the associations presented in our study.

In conclusion, microbleeds are associated with cognitive decline and dementia in the general population. A high microbleed count may represent a proxy for diffuse vascular and neurodegenerative brain damage, which predisposes to progressive cognitive deterioration.

Values represent adjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for incident dementia in participants with microbleeds compared to those without microbleeds.

Model I: adjusted for age, sex, and education level.

Model II: as Model I, additionally adjusted for APOE ε4 carriership (versus ε3/ε3) and a propensity score of cardiovascular risk factors which included hypertension, total and HDL cholesterol, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, lipid-lowering and antithrombotic medication use.

Model III: as Model I, additionally for lacunes, intracranial volume, white matter lesion volume.

n/N= number of dementia cases/total number of participants per strata. Numbers differ for model I to III because missing values for APOE genotype in model II were not imputed, and because white matter lesion volume was calculated in 4,611 participants in model III.

* Lobar microbleeds with or without cerebellar microbleeds.

± Deep or infratentorial microbleeds with or without lobar microbleeds.
