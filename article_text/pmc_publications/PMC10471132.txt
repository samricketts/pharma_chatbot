Objective:

Recent evidence supports a link between increased TDP-43 burden and the presence of an APOE4 gene allele in Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, it is difficult to conclude the direct effect of APOE on TDP-43 pathology due to the presence of mixed AD pathologies. The goal of this study is to address how APOE isoforms impact TDP-43 pathology and related neurodegeneration in the absence of typical AD pathologies.

Methods:

We overexpressed human TDP-43 via viral transduction in humanized APOE2, APOE3, APOE4 mice, and murine Apoe-knockout (Apoe-KO) mice. Behavior tests were performed across ages. Animals were harvested at 11 months of age and TDP-43 overexpression-related neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed. To further address the human relevance, we analyzed the association of APOE with TDP-43 pathology in 160 postmortem brains from autopsy-confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) in the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank.

Results:

We found that TDP-43 overexpression induced motor function deficits, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the motor cortex, especially in APOE2 mice, with much milder or absent effects in APOE3, APOE4, or Apoe-KO mice. In the motor cortex of the ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem human brains, we found that the APOE2 allele was associated with more severe TDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites.

Interpretation:

Our data suggest a genotype-specific effect of APOE on TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration in the absence of AD pathology, with the strongest association seen with APOE2.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is defined by the presence of two pathological features: amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles.1 In addition, many AD brains have other pathological lesions and can be considered mixed dementia.2 Inclusions of TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), a key pathological component of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)3, is frequently detected in up to 57% of individuals with AD.4–6 In addition, TDP-43 pathology is commonly found in elderly individuals with hippocampal sclerosis7, 8 and in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).9 The presence of TDP-43 pathology influences cognitive function in aging.6 These findings provide strong evidence supporting TDP-43 as an integral part of multiple neurodegenerative disorders, which makes better understanding of its pathogenesis and its association with neurodegenerative phenotype imperative.

As the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), has been reported to increase the risk of developing AD co-pathologies, such as TDP-43, and it also increases the risk for LATE.2, 10–12 APOE is an apolipoprotein involved in transport of lipids, delivering lipids to neurons to support brain function.13–15 It is well-documented that APOE4 increases brain amyloid burden in an allele dose-dependent manner.14 APOE4 impacts amyloid during the seeding stage by perturbing Aβ clearance and enhancing Aβ aggregation and seeding.14, 16 Interestingly, a recent study of a large cohort of 1044 community-based older adults from the Religious Orders Study &amp; Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) showed an association of APOE4 with TDP-43 proteinopathy, which persisted after accounting for other pathologies.12 Of note, the association between TDP-43 proteinopathy and APOE4 was identified only in the subset of individuals who had an intermediate-to-high probability of AD at autopsy, but not in those who did not meet the pathological criteria for AD.12 Given the strong effects of APOE4 on increasing brain amyloid burden in AD, it is difficult to assess whether the effect of APOE4 on TDP-43 in AD in the ROSMAP study is related to indirect effects of amyloid pathology. Prior investigations of associations of APOE with TDP-43 pathology in FTLD-TDP are limited. One previous study using the data from National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) showed that APOE2 was associated with TDP-43 pathologies in FTLD-TDP; however, the significance diminished after adjusting for AD co-pathologies.17 Therefore, it is important to investigate the role of APOE in TDP-43 pathogenesis in a model system, as well as in ALS and FTLD brains that are devoid of Aβ and tau pathologies.

To address this question, we used viral transduction to overexpress human TDP-43 in humanized APOE genotype-specific mice and in Apoe-knockout (ApoE-KO) mice, which lacks AD pathology. We demonstrate that TDP-43 overexpression induces motor deficits, neuronal loss and gliosis in the motor cortex that is most severe in APOE2 mice. We further find that in the autopsy-confirmed ALS and FTLD with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND), the APOE2 allele is associated with more severe TDP-43 pathology. Together, these animal and human studies suggest that APOE2, but not APOE4, exacerbates TDP-43 pathology independent of Alzheimer type pathology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

Human APOE-targeted replacement mice were obtained from Taconic Biosciences (models APOE2: #1547, APOE3: #1548, and APOE4: #1549) as in previous studies.18–20 Apoe-KO mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (strain: #002052). The animals were housed with regulated temperature and lighting conditions, as well as free access to food and water. The animal procedures performed were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Both male and female mice were randomly assigned to each group.

Intracerebroventricular viral injections in animals

AAV9 vectors containing plasmids that express human wild-type full-length TDP-43 fused with a red fluorescent protein (mApple) tag (AAV9.CAG.hTDP-43.mApple, abbreviated as AAV-TDP-43) were prepared as previously reported.21 Newborn (postnatal day 0) APOE2, APOE3, APOE4, and Apoe-KO pups were injected intracerebroventricularly with 0.5 μl of AAV-TDP-43 or an empty vector (abbreviated as AAV-Ctrl) virus (1 × 1013 viral genomes/ml) as described.22 Newborn pups in each of the breeding cages were randomly chosen to receive either AAV-TDP-43 or AAV-Ctrl.

Behavioral analyses

A panel of behavioral assays, including open field assays, elevated plus mazes, contextual and cued fear conditioning tests, hindlimb clasping tests, and rotarod tests were performed on AAV-Ctrl and AAV-TDP43 mice at 3-months through 9-months of age as described previously.19, 20

Tissue lysates

Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before undergoing transcardial perfusion with saline. Brains were harvested and bisected along the midline, with half fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, ChemCruz) over night at 4°C for histology, and the other half snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for biochemical analyses. For brain lysate preparation, each cortex was homogenized and lysed sequentially in RIPA buffer (EMD Millipore) and 2% SDS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) to collect soluble RIPA and insoluble SDS fractions as described previously.19 All fractions were stored at −80°C until they were used for Western blot analyses.

Western Blotting

Equivalent amounts of protein from the RIPA and SDS fractions of the brain lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 4–20% gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Sigma-Aldrich). After membranes were blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA), the blots were incubated with primary antibodies to detect proteins of interest. Subsequently, the blots were visualized with either chemiluminescence or the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-TDP-43 (Cat# 60019–2-Ig, Abnova, 1:1000) and anti-β-actin (Cat# A2228, Sigma, 1:2000).

Immunofluorescence staining

After overnight incubation of one hemisphere of mouse brain tissue in 4% PFA, the tissue was transferred into 30% sucrose in PBS buffer at 4°C for 24 hours. A cryostat (Leica) was then used to cut 40 μm thick slices for immunofluorescent staining. Free floating brain sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 hour and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies, including mouse anti-TDP43 (Cat# H00023435-m01, Abnova, 1:300), rabbit anti-NeuN (Cat# MABN140, EMD Millipore, 1:300), rabbit anti-PSD-95 (Cat# 51–6900, ThermoFisher, 1:200), chicken anti-neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H, Cat# AB5539, Millipore, 1:500), rabbit anti-IBA1 (Cat# 019–19741, Wako, 1:500), mouse anti-GFAP (Cat# MAB360, EMD Millipore, 1:500), and rabbit anti-GFAP (Cat# PU020–5UP, BioGenex, 1:500). After three washes with PBS, sections were incubated with the proper secondary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature, washed, mounted and cover slipped with Vectashield hard-set mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent images were captured using a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zen software, Zeiss) and a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X810, Keyence).

RNA isolation and qPCR analysis

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (ThermoFisher) and a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) to remove contaminating genomic DNA with DNAse I digestion. To reverse transcribe RNA, an iScript™ Reverse Transcription Supermix kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used. cDNA was added to a reaction mixture (20 μl final volume) with gene-specific primers and SYBR green supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The samples were run in duplicate and assessed using the 2−ΔΔCT method. The primer sequences are as follows (5’ – 3’): human TARDBP: GATGGTGTGACTGCAAACTTC (forward) and CAGCTCATCCTCAGTCATGTC (reverse); mouse Tardbp: ATATGATAGATGGGCGATGGTG (forward) and GTCATGTCCTCTGTACAACGTC (reverse); mouse Gapdh: AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG (forward) and TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA (reverse).

Statistical analyses

All statistical tests were two sided and reported as mean ± SEM (unless otherwise indicated). Student t tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons were used to compare outcomes between AAV-Ctrl and AAV-TDP-43 mice separately for Apoe-KO, APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 groups. Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn’s multiple comparison tests were used to compare outcomes among Apoe-KO-TDP-43, APOE2-TDP-43, APOE3-TDP-43, and APOE4-TDP-43 groups. Repeated measures ANOVA tests were used to compare an overall difference across many time points in a given outcome. Results of statistical tests are found in figure legends, along with numbers of animals in each analysis and the statistical significance levels. No differences were detected with respect to sex for any of the outcomes. Thus, statistical analyses data from male and female mice were combined for each APOE genotype and treatment group.

Human TDP-43 pathological assessment in ALS and FTLD-MND

All brain tissue samples used in this study were from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank for neurodegenerative disorders. We selected 124 consecutive autopsy-confirmed cases of ALS and 36 cases of FTLD-MND accessioned between 1998 and 2021. Some cases in this study were included in a previous publication.23 All brain autopsies were performed with the consent of the legal next-of-kin or an individual with power-of-attorney to authorize autopsy. Studies using de-identified autopsy samples are considered exempt from human subject research by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Formalin-fixed hemibrains underwent systematic and standardized sampling with neuropathologic evaluation by a single, experienced neuropathologist (D.W.D) as previously described23. Immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated-TDP-43 (pS409/410, Cat# CAC-TIP-PTD-M01, 1:5000, Cosmo Bio) was performed on sections of cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, midbrain, medulla, and cervical spinal cord to establish a neuropathological diagnosis of ALS or FTLD-MND. Additionally, degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, as well as corticospinal tract degeneration, was assessed with a myelin stain (Luxol fast blue with periodic-acid Schiff counterstain), as well as immunohistochemistry for microglia (IBA1, Cat# 019–19741, 1:3000, Wako Chemicals). Bunina bodies were detected on H&amp;E-stained sections. FTLD was diagnosed by the presence of atrophy with neuronal loss and gliosis in frontal and temporal cortices. The severity of TDP-43 pathology and neuronal loss was semi-quantitatively assessed in the motor cortex by three observers (S.K., A.M, and D.W.D) using a four-point scale for TDP-43 pathology (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = frequent)24, 25 and a four-point scale for neuronal loss and gliosis (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) on H&amp;E-stained sections. The TDP-43 pathology was characterized as being neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCIs) or dystrophic neurites (DNs) or both.

Genotyping for APOE single nucleotide variants (rs429358 C/T and rs7412 C/T), which define the APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 alleles, was performed using custom TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assays on a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied Bio-Systems). All cases were unrelated non-Hispanic Caucasians. All the pathological evaluations and the semi-quantitative assessments were performed blinded to APOE genotype. The demographics of cases included in the study are summarized in Table 1.

Analyses were stratified by APOE genotype as follows: APOE2 (APOE2/3 genotype), APOE3 (APOE3/3 genotype), or APOE4 (APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 genotypes). Cases with an APOE2/4 genotype were excluded from analyses. Comparisons of patient characteristics according to APOE genotype group were made using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (continuous variables) or Fisher’s exact test (categorical variables). Comparisons of TDP-43 pathology scores between APOE genotype groups were made using proportional odds logistic regression models that were adjusted for age at death, sex, and disease group. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and are interpreted as the multiplicative increase in the odds of a more severe TDP-43 pathology for APOE2 or APOE4 cases vs. the APOE3 reference group. P-values of &lt;0.0167 were considered statistically significant after applying a Bonferroni correction for the 3 different outcomes (NCIs, DNs, and neuronal loss) that were examined. All statistical tests were two-sided. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS

Generation and characterization of human TDP-43-overexpressing mice with different APOE genotypes

We performed intracerebroventricular injections of AAV-TDP-43 into newborn APOE2, APOE3, APOE4, and Apoe-KO pups at post-natal day 0 to overexpress human wild-type full-length TDP-43. Subsequently, we compared the behavioral performance over time and the final pathology of these mice with mice injected with control AAV vector (AAV-Ctrl) (Fig. 1a). The mRNA expression of human TDP-43 (hTDP-43) was confirmed through qPCR analysis, and there were no significant differences among APOE genotype groups with respect to level of hTDP-43. No hTDP-43 was detected in the AAV-Ctrl group (Fig. 1b). We also evaluated mouse endogenous TDP-43 (mTDP-43) mRNA levels and found a significant reduction of mTDP-43 in APOE4 mice overexpressing hTDP-43, whereas mTDP-43 mRNA levels were unchanged in Apoe-KO, APOE2, and APOE3 mice (Fig. 1c). The expression of hTDP-43 was confirmed with immunofluorescent staining of mouse brain sections using a C-terminal antibody to hTDP-43 that co-localized with the mApple tag expressed by the AAV vector (Fig. 1d). Additionally, the expression of hTDP-43 protein was found primarily in neurons, with little to no detectable signal in non-neuronal cells, such as microglia or astrocytes (Fig 1e &amp; f), as previously reported.22 Furthermore, hTDP-43 protein expression, detected via immunoblot as a band appearing at approximately 70 kDa in molecular weight (43 kDa full-length TDP-43 + 27 kDa mApple tag), was present in both RIPA-soluble (Fig. 1g &amp; h) and SDS-insoluble (Fig. 1i &amp; j) brain lysates, with no significant difference between APOE groups. No hTDP-43 was detected in the AAV-Ctrl group (Fig. 1g &amp; i). The results show that mice in this study overexpress human TDP-43 in neurons.

APOE2 exacerbates motor deficits in human TDP-43-overexpressing mice

Both animal models and patients with primary TDP-43 pathology, such as ALS and FTLD-TDP, exhibit progressive behavioral and motor abnormalities.26–28 To evaluate the effects of human TDP-43 overexpression on behavior, we performed a variety of behavioral tests assessing motor coordination (hindlimb clasping tests and rotarod tests), associative memory (contextual and cued fear conditioning tests), and anxiety (open field and elevated plus maze tests) starting at 5 weeks of age ( Figs. 2 &amp; 3). We observed significant motor deficits in the TDP-43-overexpressing mice compared to littermate controls, including impairments in hindlimb clasping (Fig. 2a-d). Interestingly, starting at 5 weeks of age, APOE2-TDP-43 mice were the first to show hindlimb clasping, and they continued to deteriorate over time compared to littermate controls (Fig. 2b). As for the other APOE genotypes, APOE3-TDP-43, APOE4-TDP-43, and Apoe-KO-TDP-43 mice developed hindlimb clasping at 7 weeks of age (Fig. 2a, c, &amp; d). To further investigate motor dysfunction, we performed a rotarod motor function test at 3 months (Fig. 2e-h) and 9 months of age (Fig. 2i-l). The motor dysfunction appeared to be only in APOE2-TDP-43 mice at 9 months of age, with decreased latency to fall from the rotor during the 3rd and 4th days of testing (Fig. 2j), but not at 3 months of age (Fig. 2f). The Apoe-KO-TDP-43, APOE3-TDP-43, and APOE4-TDP-43 mice did not exhibit significant difference in motor function compared to their own controls at either 3 months (Fig. 2e, g, and h) or 9 months of age (Fig. 2i, k, and l). These findings imply that TDP-43 overexpression impacts motor function differentially according to APOE genotype, with APOE2 genotype showing the impairment during disease progression. We did not observe any differences associated with TDP-43-overexpression in the open field assay (Fig. 3a &amp; e), elevated plus maze (Fig. 3b &amp; f) or cued fear conditioning (Fig. 3c, d, g, &amp; h) at either 3 or 9 months of age regardless of APOE genotype, suggesting that TDP-43 overexpression, by itself, is not associated with anxiety or associative memory. These findings indicate that human TDP-43 overexpression is detrimental to motor function, and that the effects are most severe in APOE2 mice.

APOE2 induces neurodegeneration and gliosis in the motor cortex of TDP-43-overexpressing mice

Behavioral analyses showed an age-dependent motor dysfunction associated with TDP-43 overexpression in the context of different APOE genotypes. Therefore, we harvested mice at 11 months of age and analyzed the motor cortex for pathological and biochemical changes. Like other neurodegenerative disorders, TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with significant neuronal loss.4, 29, 30 To evaluate neurodegeneration in motor cortex, we performed NeuN nuclei immunostaining (Fig. 4a). We found that only the APOE2-TDP-43 mice, but not the APOE3-TDP-43, APOE4-TDP-43 or Apoe-KO-TDP-43 mice, showed significant neurodegeneration (~20% of neuronal loss) in the motor cortex compared to their own littermate controls (Fig. 4b). Consistently, further immunostaining with post synaptic marker PSD-95 and axonal marker NF-H revealed significant reduction in APOE2-TDP-43 mice, but not the APOE3-TDP-43, APOE4-TDP-43 or Apoe-KO-TDP-43 mice (Fig. 4c-f), suggesting a synaptic loss and axonal degeneration in APOE2-TDP-43 mice.

Gliosis and neuroinflammation are commonly observed in a range of neurodegenerative disorders.31–33 We evaluated astrocytic gliosis with immunofluorescent staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Fig. 5a), and microgliosis with immunofluorescent staining for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) (Fig. 5c). We observed a significant increase in burden of GFAP with respect to image analysis (Fig. 5b) in APOE2-TDP-43, a trending increase in APOE3-TDP-43, but not in APOE4-TDP-43 or Apoe-KO-TDP-43 mice after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, when compared to their own controls. Similarly, with IBA1 immunostaining, we found a significant increase in burden of IBA1 with respect to image analysis in APOE2-TDP-43, a trending increase in APOE3-TDP-43 and APOE4-TDP-43 mice, but not in Apoe-KO-TDP-43 mice (Fig. 5d). Together, these results suggest that human TDP-43 overexpression in APOE2 mice induces strong gliosis in the motor cortex consistent with neurodegeneration.

APOE2 is associated with more severe TDP-43 pathology in ALS and FTLD-MND

To further investigate associations of APOE genotype on TDP-43 pathology in humans, we studied neuropathologically confirmed ALS and FTLD-MND cases without known genetic mutations and with minimal or no AD-type pathology (Table 1). The frequency of APOE genotype in this autopsy cohort was APOE2 carriers (APOE2/3, 16%), APOE3 carriers (APOE3/3, 61%), and APOE4 carriers (APOE3/4 and APOE4/4 genotypes, 23%). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics with respect to APOE genotype (Table 1). To determine if there was an association with TDP-43, we assessed severity of phosphorylated TDP-43 immunoreactivity in the motor cortex with respect to NCIs and DNs (Fig. 6a &amp; b) as assessed by three neuropathologists blinded to genotype. The severity of neurodegeneration (neuronal loss and gliosis) was also assessed on adjacent sections of motor cortex stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) (Fig. 6c). The severity of TDP-43 pathology was worse in APOE2 carriers, in terms of DN burden, than in APOE3 carriers after adjusting for age at death, sex, and disease group (ALS and FTLD-MND) (OR=3.35, P=0.004, Fig. 6d). There was no significant difference in the severity of TDP-43-immunoreactive NCIs or neurodegeneration when comparing APOE2 vs. APOE3 or comparing APOE4 vs. APOE3 (Fig. 6d). These findings suggest that the APOE2 may be associated with TDP-43 pathology, in particular DNs, in “pure” TDP-43 proteinopathies.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we addressed whether APOE genotype is associated with TDP-43 pathology. Using virally mediated TDP-43-overexpressing mice with varying APOE genetic background devoid of amyloid and tau pathology, we demonstrated that APOE2 accelerates motor deficits, as well as neuronal loss and gliosis in the motor cortex, whereas these changes were mild or absent in TDP-43-overexpressing mice with APOE3, APOE4, and Apoe-KO. Moreover, in humans we found that the APOE2 genotype was associated with more TDP-43-immunoreactive DNs in the motor cortex of ALS and FTLD-MND. Together, our study suggests that in the absence of Alzheimer type pathology, APOE2, but not APOE4, increases TDP-43 related toxicity.

Previous studies have shown that the APOE2 allele has a protective effect on the development of AD.34, 35 On the other hand, we have previously shown that APOE2, independent of amyloid, increases formation of pathological tau species and behavioral abnormalities in an AAV-tau mouse model. We also found that APOE2 was associated with increased tau pathology in the brains of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).20 In the present study, we observed exacerbation effects of APOE2 on increasing TDP-43-induced neurodegeneration and motor deficits in mouse models and on TDP-43 pathology, particularly DNs, in the brains of ALS and FTLD-MND. These results suggest similar enhancing effects of APOE2 on both tau and TDP-43 pathologies, particularly in the absence of amyloid deposits.

It is of interest that tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies may share pathological processes, including upstream genetic and environmental modifiers, as well as downstream disease processes.36–40 The most common clinical presentations of FTLD-tau are PSP syndrome (PSPS) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS), while ALS and FTLD-MND are common presentations of TDP-43 proteinopathies.38, 41 The present complementary studies using animal models and postmortem human brains show that APOE2 is associated with primary tauopathy and TDP-43 proteinopathy, suggesting that APOE2 may play a role in common disease mechanisms that impact tau and TDP-43 protein aggregation. Although our results demonstrate that APOE2 does not offer protection against tau and TDP-43 aggregation, given the relative rarity of the APOE2 gene allele and of ALS and FTLD-MND, additional studies with larger sample sizes are needed to support the preliminary evidence that APOE2 may affect pathogenesis of TDP-43 proteinopathy.

The APOE4 gene allele has a strong influence on Aβ pathology.14 The association between the APOE4 allele and TDP-43 in AD has been previously investigated in pathologically confirmed AD with TDP-43 co-pathology.6, 11, 12 These studies showed that AD patients with TDP-43 co-pathology were more likely to carry an APOE4 allele when compared to TDP-43 negative AD.6 TDP-43 pathological burden and stage increase in an APOE4 allele dose dependent manner when controlled for other co-pathologies;12 and there is both a direct association between APOE4 and TDP-43 and an indirect, yet equally strong, association between tau and TDP-43 pathologies mediated by Aβ.11 Together with the findings from our animal models and analyses of the motor cortex in ALS and FTLD-MND, these data imply that the effect of APOE4 on TDP-43 observed in AD might be dependent on amyloid pathology. More comprehensive model systems with or without amyloid can further address APOE effects on TDP-43 pathology.

In clinical studies of patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the effect of APOE is controversial due to the complexity of pathology related with FTD clinical syndromes. In a gene-based association study of FTD, it was reported that APOE4 was associated with behavioral variant FTD.42 A meta-analysis of FTD also showed association between APOE4 and FTD;43 however, Verpillat et al. reported a significant increase of APOE2 allele frequency in FTD44 and Chio et al. also found APOE2 to enhance risk of FTD and ALS.45 Therefore, the study of autopsy-confirmed FTLD may provide a more clear association between APOE genotype and TDP-43 pathology.

The mechanisms by which APOE impacts TDP-43 pathology remains unclear. There are several possibilities that can be explored in future studies. First, it has been shown that microglia play an important role in modifying TDP-43 pathology and related neurodegeneration.22, 31 The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is expressed exclusively in myeloid lineage cells, in particular microglia.46, 47 A recent study shows that TREM2 interacts with TDP-43 and mediates microglial neuroprotection against TDP-43-related neurodegeneration in early stages, where the deficiency of TREM2 impairs phagocytic clearance of pathological TDP-43 by microglia leading to enhanced neuronal damage and impaired motor function.22 Of note, in our model of APOE2-TDP-43 mice, we observed elevated microglia response likely related to neurodegeneration in the later stages of disease. It might be possible that the microglia response is neuroprotective in the early stage, but it becomes detrimental in the late stage of TDP-43-related neurodegeneration,48, 49 which can be further addressed in proper experimental settings. Interestingly, it is known that TREM2 can interact with a wide array of ligands, including APOE.50, 51 Importantly, both TREM2 and APOE play critical roles in triggering, sustaining and controlling the acquisition of the disease-associated phenotypes of microglia,52–54 raising the intriguing possibility that TREM2-APOE-TDP-43 interactions may together regulate microglial function and thus, potentially modify TDP-43 pathology in an APOE isoform-specific manner. Since AAV vectors could also potentially trigger immune response in mice, 55 future studies could use transgenic animals or other model systems to rule out the potential confounding effects of AAV injection-related immune responses. Second, APOE isoforms have differential effects on vascular-related outcomes where APOE2 has been shown to be a risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and related microhemorrhages.34 Interestingly, it was also reported that TDP-43 overexpression induced blood-brain-barrier damage, which yielded the frontal cortex vulnerable to the systemic inflammatory response and lead to neurogeneration.56 As such, there might be a synergetic pathogenic effects of APOE2 and TDP-43 on cerebrovascular damage. Third, it is well-known that the primary function of APOE in the brain is to distribute lipids. APOE2-containing lipoprotein particles are more lipidated than APOE3 and APOE4 particles and thus can deliver more lipids to neurons.34 TREM2 is a key modulator of lipid metabolism in microglia.57, 58 Of note, TDP-43 can also regulate whole-body metabolism, including metabolism of lipids and glucose through the obesity-related gene Tbc1d1.59, 60 These findings highlight the potential involvement of lipid metabolism regulation in APOE-related pathways of modifying TDP-43 pathology and the need for further investigation.61 Last, TDP-43 is an evolutionarily conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. It was reported that TDP-43 controls its own expression through a negative feedback mechanism in the physiological condition and the pathological TDP-43 species disrupt TDP-43 self-regulation, thus contributing to pathogenesis.62 In our animal models after overexpressing TDP-43, we observed reduced mouse endogenous TDP-43 in APOE4 mice, but not in Apoe-KO, APOE2, and APOE3 mice, suggesting that APOE may further regulate the autoregulation of TDP-43 levels. The disruption of proper regulation of TDP-43 under different APOE genotype background may also contribute to the different outcome of pathogenesis we observed.

Our animal study does have its limitations. Although we show that the APOE2 genotype increased motor deficits, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the motor cortex of the TDP-43 overexpression model, the specific molecular mechanism driving this effect remains unclear and needs to be further investigated. Additionally, although we reported minimal effects of APOE4 in this model, we did not have a large number of APOE4 control mice for comparison due to the unexpected loss of animals in this group. Future studies should aim at reproducing these findings using similar or alternative animal models. Next, although our model system successfully overexpresses human TDP-43, it does not recapitulate the entire pathology present within human brains. For example, the phosphorylation or mislocalization of TDP-43 was quite mild in our models at 11 months of age (data not shown). Therefore, other models of TDP-43 proteinopathy should be used to study effects of APOE on TDP-43 pathology, such as the transgenic mouse model (rNLS8) that inducibly expresses human TDP-43 with a defective nuclear localization signal.63 Additionally, we transduced human TDP-43 expression using AAV-mediated gene delivery approach in neonate mice as previously applied for expressing human tau and α-synuclein in animals.19, 20 Thus, it is possible that the effects seen in our study could be related to alteration of the postanal development of the animals. The local viral injection to express human TDP-43 in adult mice would give us valuable insight to further test the brain region vulnerability and should be considered for future studies. Lastly, the potentially synergistic contribution of AD pathology (Aβ and tau) on the APOE genotype effect on TDP-43 pathology is not addressed in our study and needs to be further investigated.

In summary, our study provides evidence that APOE2 plays a pathogenic role in the severity of TDP-43 pathology independent of Aβ or tau in both mouse models and human ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem brains. These findings provide insights into the role of APOE on TDP-43 proteinopathy and suggest that APOE2 may not be protective in all neurodegenerative diseases. This fact needs to be considered when developing therapeutics combating AD, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Fig. 1: Generation and characterization of AAV-TDP-43 mouse models

Neonatal Apoe-KO, APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice were transduced by i.c.v. injection of AAV9-hTDP-43-mApple (AAV-TDP-43) to express human TDP-43. An empty AAV vector was injected into the littermates as controls (AAV-Ctrl). A battery of behavioral tests was performed across the timeline and the animals were harvested at 11 months of age for pathological evaluation. (a) The illustration of the study design and timeline.

Fig. 2: APOE2 exacerbates motor deficits in AAV-TDP-43 mouse models

Behavioral performances of motor coordination were assessed in the AAV-TDP-43 mice and their respective controls. (a-d) Hindlimb clasping tests were performed multiple times between 1-month and 9-months of the age to assess disease progression. The test was performed three times at each time point and the average clasping score was recorded. (e-l) Rotarod performance tests were evaluated at 3-months (e-h) and 9-months (i-l) of the age. The latency to fall was assessed and four days of trials were evaluated at each age. n = 4–14 mice per group, mixed sex. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. The repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for an overall difference (across all time points) in a given outcome measure between the two groups being examined, where fixed effects were included for group and time for each mouse. Subsequently, outcomes were compared between the two groups at each separate time point using a student t test. P values of ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. *p &lt; 0.05; **p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001; ****p &lt; 0.0001; N.S., not significant.

Fig. 6: APOE2 increases TDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites in the motor cortex of ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem human brains

The severity of TDP-43 lesions and neuronal loss in the motor cortex of ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem human brains from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank was semi-quantitatively assessed and their association with APOE genotype was evaluated in the blinded manner. (a &amp; b) The morphology of TDP-43 pathology was defined as neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI, a) and dystrophic neurites (DN, b) by phospho-TDP-43 staining. The severity of TDP-43 pathology was graded semi-quantitatively on a four-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = frequent). The representative images for each score are shown. (c) The neuronal loss was assessed using a four-point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = frequent) on H&amp;E-stained sections. The representative images for each score are shown. (d) Comparisons of TDP-43 pathology and neuronal loss scores between APOE genotype groups (APOE2 vs. APOE3, and APOE4 vs. APOE3) were made using proportional odds logistic regression models that were adjusted for age at death, sex, and disease group. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. P values of &lt; 0.0167 were considered as statistically significant after applying a Bonferroni correction for the 3 different scores that were examined.
