Background:

A key challenge in studies that model outcomes, disease progression, and cost-effectiveness of existing and emerging dementia treatments is the lack of conversion criteria to translate, or ‘crosswalk’, scores on multiple measurement scales. Clinical status in dementia is commonly characterized in the cognitive, functional, and behavioral domains.

Objective:

We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed dementia measure crosswalks in the three domains.

Methods:

We systematically reviewed published literature for crosswalks between scales used to measure cognitive, functional, or behavioral outcomes in Alzheimer’s and related dementias. The search was conducted in PubMed, and additional crosswalks were identified through snowballing and expert input from dementia modelers.

Results:

Of the reviewed articles, 2,334 were identified through a PubMed search, 842 articles were sourced from backward and forward citation snowballing, and 8 additional articles were recommended through expert input. 31 papers were eligible for inclusion, listing 74 unique crosswalks. Of those, 62 (83.8%) were between endpoints of the cognitive domain and 12 (16.2%) were either between endpoints of the functional domain or were hybrid in nature. Among crosswalks exclusively in the cognitive domain, a majority involved the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (37 crosswalks) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its variants (25 crosswalks). MMSE was directly compared to MoCA or MoCA variants in 16 crosswalks.

Conclusion:

Existing crosswalks between measures of dementia focus largely on a limited selection of outcome measures, particularly MMSE and MoCA. Few crosswalks exist in the functional domain, and no crosswalks were identified for solely behavioral measures.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The measurement of clinical progress in Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias requires the use of standardized outcome measures (clinical trial endpoints). Clinical trials for novel therapeutics in this disease area use a wide range of primary and secondary endpoints, often with disparate psychometric properties and complexities of administration [1]. Endpoint selection is influenced by numerous considerations, including dementia disease state, patient demographics, psychometric properties, sensitivity to treatment effect, regulatory requirements, availability and costs [2]. As potential new disease-modifying therapies approach regulatory review, researchers and decision-makers have developed models that often require the cross-referencing of specific values on multiple measure scales, including the crosswalking from intermediate trial endpoints to policy-relevant outcomes (such as time to diagnosis) [3]. The demand for crosswalks may also exist in the comparison of multiple drug candidates, or when comparing population estimates from different survey sources using different measures [2] (such as the ongoing validation of health economic models conducted by the International Pharmaco-Economic Collaboration on Alzheimer’s Disease (IPECAD) [4]). The need for crosswalks between outcome measures is further accentuated by a lack of data harmonization in Alzheimer’s disease research, which has resulted in the use of a large number of outcomes, including many non-standardized ones [5, 6]. This has prompted the development of formal crosswalks between some common measures in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias [3]. As we conceptualize them, crosswalks allow conversion of a score from one measure to another, but they may vary in scope and development methodology. More specifically, we define a crosswalk as an algorithm or another method for the comparison or conversion of specific values on at least two endpoint scales (no commonly used definition of a crosswalk has been identified and no systematic review of existing crosswalks applicable to Alzheimer’s disease outcome measurement has been conducted). We present the first systematic review of existing crosswalks in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, focusing on the cognitive, functional and behavioral domains, and indicate opportunities for future research in this space. We follow PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols) guidelines [7].

METHODS

A systematic review of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia crosswalks involving endpoints of the cognitive, functional, and behavioral domains was performed using the PubMed database. A supplementary search was also conducted using backward and forward citation searching (snowballing) and expert input was solicited to identify potentially omitted articles. Articles were selected based on a search strategy and coded by the research team as described in detail below. PubMed was selected for its focus on biomedical research and sufficient historical coverage (1966 to the present for its largest component, MEDLINE [8]) and consequently, sufficiently high expected coverage of relevant studies in the field. Expert input was added to account for the limitations of this choice as well as the possible limitations of our inclusion and exclusion criteria, listed below. Human subjects were not involved in this research and the research plan was reviewed by the University of Southern California Institutional Review Board.

Search strategy

A structured search of PubMed was conducted between June 26 and July 15, 2020, for published crosswalks in dementia research. We did not restrict our search by year of publication. Our search required that the Title or Abstract contain at least one keyword from each of the following three groups: (1) alzheimer∗, dementia; (2) crosswalk, bridge, bridging, equating, percentile, equipercentile, algorithm, mapping; and (3) cognitive, cognition, behavioral, behavior, behaviour, behavioural, functional, function, neuropsychological, neurologic. Based on preliminary pilot search studies, we excluded articles that contained the term “trial” in the title given their primary objective not being the development of a crosswalk (an expanded search without this exclusion did not produce additional candidates for review). Where relevant, both British and American spelling was used. Our search strategy was developed in consultation with experts from the International Pharmaco-Economic Collaboration on Alzheimer’s Disease (IPECAD) working group, listed in Acknowledgments. Complete search details and search keywords are listed in the Supplementary Material.

Two of three reviewers (SF, AH, AK) independently reviewed each title and abstract to make an initial decision regarding each article’s inclusion of one or multiple outcome measure crosswalks in dementia. The reviewers did not exclude articles that contained validation of previous crosswalks as long as the articles reported their own crosswalk results. Articles studying the performance of individual scales (e.g., their specificity and sensitivity) were not included unless a novel crosswalk was presented. Similarly, articles presenting correlations alone were excluded, as they do not allow for a one-to-one crosswalk from one score to another. After full-text review and further exclusion, two of three reviewers (SF, AH, AK) conducted snowballing using backward and forward citation searches using each of the remaining articles via PubMed [9–11]. Any discrepancies were resolved by the research team with oversight from the lead reviewer (JH).

To account for possible limitations of our search strategy, we solicited input from 185 international dementia experts, identified through the National Institute of Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers [12], the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimer’s Disease (EMIF AD) Catalogue [13], and the International Pharmaco-Economic Collaboration on Alzheimer’s Disease (IPECAD) [14]. We shared our preliminary findings in an August 2020 form and asked for input regarding studies not captured using our search criteria. Eleven experts responded with eight stating that they were not aware of additional crosswalks and three suggesting a total of eight additional crosswalk studies to consider. We applied identical criteria to ascertain which of these satisfied our inclusion criteria.

Data extraction

Key data were extracted from full-text studies by one of three reviewers (SF, AH, AK) and verified by the lead reviewer (JH). The following information was extracted for crosswalk development samples using a standard template: specific crosswalk(s) reported, crosswalk domain, sample size, age range, average age (with standard deviation, if reported), education attainment (with standard deviation, if reported), race, gender, diagnosis/diagnoses, location of data collection, and method used to develop the crosswalk (we group these based on similarity of several key methods utilized).

Data synthesis

We provide descriptive statistics for studies and crosswalks identified in the search. We present the evidence collected in its entirety, provide a descriptive analysis of crosswalks by domain and by region of origin, and present a summary of methods used to develop existing dementia crosswalks. We do not perform a meta-analysis given the qualitative differences between different crosswalks within each domain.

RESULTS

Our search of PubMed resulted in 2,334 articles for review. Of those, 2,308 were not relevant based on title and abstract. All reviewers checked each of the remaining 26 studies for relevance by reviewing the full-text, resulting in exclusion of 10 studies that did not present relevant or original crosswalks. In the next phase, we conducted forward and backward citation searches via PubMed resulting in the identification of an additional 842 potential articles. Of those, 824 studies were excluded based on title and abstract review. After reviewing the full-text of the remaining 18 papers, 11 additional articles were added to our final list. Additionally, expert solicitation resulted in the identification of 8 additional studies of which 4 presented a novel crosswalk. This resulted in a total of 31 papers included in our analysis. Details of this process are shown in a three-part PRISMA flowchart as depicted in Fig. 1.

Study characteristics

The 31 studies identified report 74 unique crosswalks, including 62 (83.8%) between two endpoints of the cognitive domain. The remaining 12 (16.2%) concern measurements in domains related to physical and psychological function (e.g., Activities of Daily Living) or are multi-domain crosswalks (termed ‘hybrid’) with endpoints from different domains (e.g., ADL crosswalked with MMSE) or endpoints composed of multiple domains (e.g., FIM is a measure of cognitive and functional abilities).1 Table 1 reports summary details on the included studies. The majority of studies, 18 (58.1%), were United States (US)-based, with other studies from a wide range of international settings. (Where international versions have been explicitly named, we list them as the authors have named them, e.g., the Czech MoCA and s-MOCA used by Bezdicek et al.). We show additional summary statistics including the crosswalk methods used by the reviewed studies in Table 2. A list of unique crosswalks with their corresponding studies is reported in Supplementary Table 1. We group endpoints by domain and note their usual method of administration (patient, proxy or both) in Table 3.

We discuss the characteristics of papers identified by domain as well as by geographic origin next. We then discuss key methods used to develop published crosswalks.

Cognitive studies

62 cognitive crosswalks in 27 studies have been identified. Of these, 16 crosswalks between MMSE and MoCA were identified, of which 11 used conventional versions of both tests. We present these crosswalks in Fig. 2 and provide detailed statistics in Supplementary Table 2. As Fig. 2 indicates, MMSE-MoCA crosswalks show relatively high degrees of agreement for MoCA scores of 7 and higher, with heterogeneity in lower scores associated with greater cognitive impairment. Two of these crosswalks differ somewhat from the rest: Scheffels et al. [15] offer an indirect crosswalk between MMSE and MoCA via a PANDA measure, while Solomon et al. [16] present a formula-based crosswalk (which results in out-of-bound predictions). Of the remaining 5 studies, crosswalks were established between the following dyads: MMSE and the Czech Version of the MoCA [17] MMSE and the Czech Short Version of the MoCA [17]. MMSE and a 5-Minute Version of MoCA [18], MMSE and the Short MoCA [19], and MMSE and the Abbreviated MoCA [20].

A variety of other cognitive crosswalks were also identified. The DRS and MMSE crosswalk was reported in multiple studies: Meiran et al. (1996) [21], Bobholz and Brandt (1993) [22], and Salmon et al. (1990) [23] used the basic version of DRS; and Fields et al. (2010) [24] and van Steenoven et al. (2014) [25] used the DRS-2 version. The most common cognitive endpoints were MMSE (41 crosswalks), MoCA (26 crosswalks), DRS/DRS-2 (11 crosswalks), and ADAS-Cog (6 crosswalks). A full listing of all unique crosswalks is included in Supplementary Table 1.

Functional and hybrid studies

12 crosswalks included at least one endpoint that was not solely cognitive (e.g., functional or hybrid (multi-domain)). Two unique crosswalks for FIM and MDS were identified in Williams et al. (1997) [26] and Velozo et al. (2007) [27]. Two unique crosswalks for CDR and MMSE were identified in Balsis et al. (2015) [28] and Perneczky et al. (2006) [29]. One crosswalk was identified for each of the following dyads: ADL—MoCA, ADAS-Cog—ADL, ADL—GDS, ADL—MMSE (all in Solomon et al. (2014) [16]), ADAS-Cog—CDR [28], CGI-S— mini-ICF-APP [30], DRS-2—ROIL-Part A, and MMSE—ROIL-Part A (both in Fields et al. (2010) [24]). The most common non-cognitive endpoint was ADL, which was included in 4 crosswalks.

Geographic region

The majority of studies reported originated from the US (18 studies, or 58.1%). Eight of the US-based studies (44.4%) reported information on race-ethnicity while no studies based outside the US reported on race-ethnicity. The unweighted average age of all US crosswalk cohorts was 75.1 years (average age reported in 16 out of 18 studies). The 13 studies based outside the US (41.9%) took place in various international settings: 8 in Europe, 2 in Canada, and 3 in Asia. A larger share of international studies (69.2%) used the equipercentile method relative to the US studies (55.6%). The unweighted average age of the international crosswalk cohorts was 67.7 years (age reported in 11 out of 13 studies).

Diagnoses

Our study has identified studies presenting crosswalks between measures used in Alzheimer’s disease. As a result, some papers include a broader set of diagnoses or may focus on another type of dementia. 18 (58.1%) of the papers identified included cognitively normal individuals, 18 included mild cognitive impairment or suspected cognitive impairment, 19 (61.3%) included Alzheimer’s disease specifically (or unspecified dementia), and 3 (9.7%) included Parkinson’s disease. Two studies did not explicitly include cognitively impaired individuals due to dementia; Scheffels et al. (2018) [31] listed various neurological diseases and Egger et al. (2019) [30] focused on mental health disorders, although it is possible that some individuals in these samples had cognitive impairment. Diagnoses were not mutually exclusive, and a full listing of each diagnosis is provided in Table 1.

Statistical methods

Equipercentile methods

Equipercentile methods rely on the comparison of percentile-based ranks on two or more scales, where scale values that have the same percentile rank are identified as equivalent.

In both US-based and non-US-based studies reviewed, the majority relied on an equipercentile method to develop a crosswalk between two or more scales (55.5% and 69.2%, respectively). However, the equipercentile method was relatively less common in functional and hybrid crosswalk studies relative to cognitive ones (14.3% and 66.7%, respectively). Overall, the equipercentile method was used in 19 studies (61.3% of all studies reviewed).

As shown in Table 1, some papers rely on the equipercentile method alone, while others use equipercentile equating with smoothing (often, the equate package in R [32] or a macro is SAS is referenced [33]). Smoothing methods are used to “reduce irregularities due to sampling error in either the score distributions or the equipercentile equating function itself,” typically using polynomial loglinear presmoothing or cubic-spline postsmoothing [32]. Smoothing was assumed in all papers referencing one of the two packages.

Only a limited number of papers reported confidence intervals for their equipercentile-based crosswalks (notably Monsell et al. (2016) [34] and Bergeron et al. (2017) [35]).

Regression methods

Regression methods used in our sample draw on univariate or multivariate linear regression models that produce an equation for the comparison of scores on two scales. Regression methods are similarly common in cognitive crosswalk studies relative to functional and hybrid studies (25.9% and 28.6%, respectively), and are used in 7 studies (22.6% of all studies reviewed). 4 of 7 papers using regression methods were published before 2000.

Other methods

Six papers used other methods to develop crosswalks. Bezd´ıček et al. (2018) [17] used item response theory to adapt the English version of MoCA to its Czech equivalent and to assess the validity of the Short Czech Version of MoCA (s-MoCA-CZ). Both Czech versions were contrasted with MMSE. Similarly, a crosswalk by Velozo et al. (2007) [27] references item response theory and relies on Rasch analysis for the conversion of raw scores between FIM and MDS. Balsis et al. (2015) [28] used item response theory to compare ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and CDR-SOB instruments. Meiran et al. (1996) [21] used regression and percentile-based methods in a study of five mental-status neuropsychological tools for dementia, and Perneczky et al. (2006) [29] used ROC curve-based cutoffs in their work on CDR and MMSE. Finally, one of the oldest studies in our sample also develops a crosswalk for FIM and MDS [26], drawing on an expert panel and a rescaling approach to link subscores on each of the instruments.

DISCUSSION

The existing body of literature on dementia crosswalks is most robust in the cognitive domain, primarily between the popular MMSE and MoCA endpoints. Other crosswalks presented in multiple studies included DRS—MMSE (3 studies), DRS-2—MMSE (2 studies), ADAS-Cog—MMSE (2 studies), CDR—MMSE (2 studies), and FIM—MDS (2 studies). All other crosswalks have been reported in just one study each, suggesting that there is an existing evidence gap in the validation of published crosswalks and the adaptation of measures to other cohorts and regional settings.

Instruments for which the most crosswalks exist are MMSE (41 crosswalks), MoCA (26 crosswalks), DRS/DRS-2 (11 crosswalks) and ADAS-Cog (6 crosswalks). Of note, several endpoints popular in Alzheimer’s disease trials (i.e., Clinician’s Interview-Based Impression of Change with Caregiver Input (CIBIC+), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), and Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)) were not featured in the reviewed studies. This may have several reasons, such as their relatively recent increases in clinical use and the unique nature of select endpoints—particularly behavioral ones—which might make the bridging of two scales more challenging due to lack of similarity. Principal component analysis may provide some insight into the comparability of behavioral and other measures, as shown by Yesevage et al. (2016) [36].

Of note, our review has identified studies that include non-dementia populations. This is expected for participants on the dementia continuum (ranging from cognitively normal performance and mild cognitive impairment to different stages of dementia), but may affect the applicability of crosswalks identified which do not specify diagnoses (notably Scheffels et al. (2018) [31] and Egger et al. (2019) [30]) or do not explicitly focus on Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias (notably Williams et al. (1997) [26] and Velozo et al. (2007) [27], both presenting FIM-MDS crosswalks; and van Steenoven et al. (2014) [25] whose focus is on Parkinson’s disease only). We decided to report these as the scales presented are relevant to the measurement of functional decline in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Importantly, the demographic and diagnostic composition of patient cohorts differs between studies (we report diagnosis, age, gender, education and race-ethnicity data where available), making any direct or qualitative comparisons challenging. Additionally, although diagnoses were not consistently reported, our analysis identified differences in diagnostic inclusion criteria and disease severity across study samples. The application of any crosswalk should ensure that differences in both diagnostic and demographic characteristics are taken into account as crosswalks may differ in predictive accuracy between populations.

The majority of studies identified (19 out of 31, or 61.3%) drew on equipercentile equating (with or without smoothing) to develop a crosswalk between measures. Equipercentile methods may have certain advantages: notably they are less prone to specification errors thanks to their dependence on rank. Regression methods are typically used when scores on multiple assessments are available for the same subjects (commonly administered during the same visit) and allow for the introduction of demographic and other controls. However, they may suffer from specification error. Recent work suggests that other approaches, such as item response theory, may advance the science of linking and calibrating outcome measures in dementia research [37].

The heterogeneity of studies identified suggests that—depending on the patient population in question, study setting and instruments utilized by modelers—not all crosswalks may be relevant for the imputation of equivalent values on different scales. As a result, modelers should be transparent in their choice of crosswalks used and describe inherent uncertainties stemming from their use. When novel crosswalks are developed by research teams, they should be considered for publication to advance scholarship in this emerging field. For the most frequent crosswalk (MMSE—MoCA), a critical review may be conducted to assess study quality and differences between individual crosswalks beyond what is reported here.

As new therapies for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias reach regulatory review, we expect that greater attention will be given to decision models that predict clinical and economic outcomes based on trial results, which may be reported using different cognitive, functional, or behavioral scales. This may further increase the need to develop explicit crosswalks for comparable measures. The development of crosswalks may also increase the clinical utility of longitudinal data as patients move through different care settings and may be tested using different scales and instruments over time.

Given the need to compare and contrast treatment effects of drug and non-drug interventions as well as to link clinical trial results to health economic and other disease models in Alzheimer’s disease, further crosswalk development may be required.

Strengths and limitations

We used standardized systematic review methodology in order to maximize the validity of our results. Article review and data extraction were conducted by multiple authors, and we follow PRISMA-P guidelines for systematic review reporting. We also consulted with subject-matter experts, including the IPECAD working group. This paper presents the first review of Alzheimer’s disease literature that identifies published crosswalks in the cognitive, functional and behavioral domains. As such, we used a pragmatic approach that focused on published literature in three key clinical areas of interest. However, limitations remain. First, our search captured crosswalks published in academic articles, which may not be fully representative of all crosswalks in existence, including those in other languages or not listed in PubMed but possibly in other databases (e.g., the NIH Toolbox makes a mention of crosswalks [38] but no explicit crosswalks have been identified in published literature). This is partially mitigated by articles found through snowball searches and an expert survey. Second, the lack of standardized terminology in the literature prevented us from exhaustively identifying articles that either use instrument-specific descriptors or are relevant to dementia patients but do not list any dementia explicitly in their title or abstract. Studies may employ a range of other synonyms and phrases to describe a crosswalk or the process of creating one. While the present study sought to account for this diversity of phrasing through consultation with experts and an expansive search, it is possible that relevant studies were omitted due to the reasons noted above. Third, our inclusion of crosswalks in the cognitive, functional or behavioral domains did not capture the full range of endpoints used in clinical trials, including patient- or caregiver-reported outcomes, global measures, or composite endpoints [39]. Finally, the inclusion of non-dementia diagnoses in some crosswalk studies may hinder the applicability of their findings to future dementia models. Given the pragmatic nature of this review, we did not attempt to compare the validity and applicability of any individual crosswalks but note the diagnostic profile in our full listing of papers reviewed.

CONCLUSIONS

We describe a broad literature covering the available evidence and approaches to crosswalks that pertain to clinical endpoints in Alzheimer’s disease. Crosswalks for solely behavioral endpoints have not been found, and this literature is predominantly in the cognitive domain with the most commonly elucidated pairing being between MMSE and MoCA. Our review of existing MMSE-MoCA crosswalks indicates a relatively high degree of agreement between multiple crosswalks for earlier disease stages. There is a sparsity of literature validating other crosswalks, indicating significant room for evidence generation, particularly in those instruments which are now more commonly applied in clinical trials and modeling. This is of particular concern given the lack of data harmonization in Alzheimer’s disease research. Crosswalks may serve as a valuable tool to inform clinical and policy decisions in the dementia context, but such methods involve a range of uncertainties and these should be explored in any application of crosswalk data. Given this limitation, crosswalks can be seen as a ‘second-best’ approach; the collection and use of data using primary instruments will likely continue to be preferred when available.
