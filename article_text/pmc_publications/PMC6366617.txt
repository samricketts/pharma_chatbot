Amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, yet its physiological function remains unresolved. Accumulating evidence suggests that APP has a synaptic function mediated by an unidentified receptor for the shed APP ectodomain (sAPP). Here, we showed that the sAPP extension domain directly bound the sushi 1 domain specific to the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1a (GABABR1a). sAPP-GABABR1a binding suppressed synaptic transmission and enhanced short-term facilitation in hippocampal synapses via inhibition of synaptic vesicle release. A 17 amino acid peptide corresponding to the GABABR1a binding region within APP suppressed spontaneous neuronal activity in vivo. Our findings identify GABABR1a as a synaptic receptor for sAPP and reveal a physiological role for sAPP in regulating GABABR1a function to modulate synaptic transmission.

One Sentence Summary:

Amyloid-β precursor protein suppresses vesicle release from presynaptic boutons by binding to the sushi domain of the GABAB1a receptor.


Amyloid-β Precursor Protein (APP), a type 1 transmembrane protein, was first identified more than 30 years ago (1–4) as the precursor to the amyloid-β peptide, the primary constituent of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. APP undergoes ectodomain shedding by α-, β-, or η- secretase to release soluble APP (sAPPα, sAPPβ, or sAPPη respectively) (5, 6). Evidence suggests that the synaptic function of APP (7–13) is carried out by sAPP (14, 15). sAPPα affects synaptic transmission and plasticity, including a reduction in synaptic activity and an enhancement of LTP (16–19). Moreover, sAPPα is sufficient to rescue synaptic defects in App KO mice, including defects in spine density (20), LTP (21, 22), and spatial learning (21). Together, this has led to speculation of a yet unidentified cell-surface receptor for sAPP to mediate its synaptic function (15, 23, 24).

Proteomics screen for synaptic interactors of sAPP identifies GABABR

We first confirmed, using biochemical fractionation and structured illumination imaging, that APP was abundantly expressed at presynaptic terminals (25) of excitatory and inhibitory hippocampal synapses (Fig. S1A,B). Next, to identify candidate synaptic receptors for sAPP, we performed an extensive series of affinity purification experiments using recombinant sAPP-Fc (C-terminal Fc-tag; affinity purified from transfected-HEK293T supernatants; Fig. S2A,B) to pull down interacting proteins from synaptosome extracts, followed by mass spectrometric analysis of bound proteins (AP-MS) (Fig. 1A) (26). We consistently identified, among a few intracellular proteins (Fig 1B, S3A,B, Table S1), the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 1 (GABABR1) as the most abundant and reproducible cell-surface protein, using sAPPα or sAPPβ as bait, in wildtype (WT) and in App/Aplp1 knockout (KO) synaptosome extracts (Fig. 1B, S3A,B, Table S1). Supporting our observations, APP has previously been identified in a GABABR interactome analysis (27). Together, the sAPP AP-MS experiments identified GABABR as the leading candidate for a synaptic, cell-surface receptor for sAPP.

The extension domain of APP binds the sushi 1 domain of GABABR1a

GABABR, the metabotropic receptor for the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, regulates presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic membrane excitability (28). It consists of two subunits: GABABR1 which binds GABA, and GABABR2 which couples to G proteins (29). Two major isoforms, GABABR1a and GABABR1b, differ by two N-terminal sushi repeats only present in the a-variant (29) (Fig 1C). To validate the proteomics results, we performed cell-surface binding assays, applying recombinant sAPPα-Fc to HEK293T cells expressing the GABABR ectodomain on the plasma membrane using the pDisplay vector. sAPPα-Fc, but not Fc alone, bound strongly to GABABR1a-, but not to GABABR1b-, or GABABR2-, expressing cells (Fig. 1D). Biolayer interferometry experiments using recombinant sAPPα (Fc-tag enzymatically removed; Fig. S2C-F) and GABABR1a sushi domains showed that the sushi 1 peptide was sufficient for binding sAPPα (Fig. 1E). Accordingly, excess sushi 1 peptide blocked binding of sAPPα-Fc to GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig. 1F). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) determined the dissociation constant (KD) for sAPPα-sushi 1 = 431 nM (Fig. 1G). These data show that sAPPα binds directly and selectively to the sushi 1 domain of GABABR1a with sub-micromolar affinity.

The ectodomain of the APP695 isoform contains several functional domains (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, growth factor like domain (GFLD)-Fc, copper binding domain (CuBD)-Fc, and E2-Fc each failed to bind GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). However, a peptide corresponding to the natively unstructured linker region between the APP695 E1 and E2 domains (Fig. 2A) strongly binds to GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). The linker region includes the acidic domain (AcD) and the recently defined extension domain (ExD), which is a flexible, partially structured region (30). The binding affinity of the purified ExD-AcD fragment (Fc-tag enzymatically removed) to sushi 1 in ITC experiments (Fig. 2C) was in the same range as that of full-length sAPPα binding to sushi 1 (Fig. 1G). To further narrow down the minimal domain in the APP linker region required for sushi 1 binding, we generated ExD-Fc and AcD-Fc fragments. ExD-Fc, but not AcD-Fc, bound to GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig. 2B), identifying the ExD as the minimal domain required for sushi 1 binding. Consequently, deletion of the ExD in sAPPα (sAPPαΔExD-Fc) abolished binding to GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). sAPPβ-Fc and sAPPη-Fc, a product of the recently described η-secretase processing pathway (6), which both contain the ExD, also bound to GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig 2D). APP family members APP-like protein 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2) (31) on the other hand lack a conserved ExD and failed to bind GABABR1a-expressing cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, the sAPP ExD is necessary and sufficient to bind to the GABABR1a sushi 1 domain.

sAPP suppresses presynaptic vesicle release probability via GABABR1a

Sushi domain-containing GABABR1a is the predominant isoform localized to presynaptic compartments at excitatory synapses (32–34), where it functions to inhibit neurotransmitter release (28). To test whether sAPPα can modulate GABABR function, we simultaneously measured miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs), which were separated on the basis of their distinct decay kinetics as described (35), in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons (12–17 days in vitro (DIV)) (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous observations (36, 37), acute exposure of hippocampal neurons to 30 μM baclofen, a GABABR agonist, reduced the frequency of mEPSCs by 63 ± 5% (n=14 cells; P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. S4A,B). Likewise, 250 nM sAPPα (Fc-tag removed) reduced the frequency of mEPSCs by 39 ± 5% (n=13 cells; P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 3B,C), an effect that was already apparent at 25nM (Fig. S4D,E), without affecting mEPSC amplitude (Fig. S4C). sAPPβ similarly reduced mEPSC frequency (Fig. S4D,E). Acute application of the APP695 ExD-AcD fragment reduced mEPSC frequency to a similar degree as sAPPα (Fig. 3D, S4F), whereas application of sAPPαΔExD had no effect (Fig. 3D, S4F), indicating that the extension domain of sAPP is necessary and sufficient for the suppression of spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic transmission by sAPPα. Accordingly, acute application of sAPLP1, which lacks a conserved ExD, did not reduce mEPSC frequency (Fig. S4G), although we observed a minor (17 ± 9 %; n=17 cells; P &lt; 0.05) reduction in mIPSC frequency (Fig. S4H). Pretreatment with the GABABR antagonist CGP55845 (CGP, 5 μM) attenuated the sAPPα-mediated reduction of mEPSC frequency (Fig. 3E, S4I), showing that the effect is mediated by GABABR.

GABABR1a also localizes to GABAergic boutons (34). Consistent with previous observations (37, 38), acute exposure of hippocampal neurons to 30 μM baclofen reduced the frequency of mIPSCs by 62 ± 5% (n=14 cells; P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. S5A). Acute application of 250 nM sAPPα to hippocampal neurons reduced the frequency of mIPSCs by 44 ± 5% (n=13 cells; P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 3B, S5B). Application of sAPPα caused a minor (14%) reduction in mIPSC amplitude (Fig. S5C), possibly due to a small post-synaptic effect of sAPPα on GABABR1a at post-synaptic GABAergic sites (39). The APP695 ExD-AcD fragment, but not sAPPαΔExD, reduced mIPSC frequency to a similar extent as sAPPα (Fig. S4F, S5D). The effect of sAPPα on mIPSC fequency was blocked by pretreatment with the GABABR antagonist CGP55845 (CGP, 5 μM) (Fig. S4I, S5E). Taken together, these data show that sAPPα acutely reduces both glutamatergic and GABAergic quantal synaptic transmission through a GABABR1a isoform-dependent mechanism.

sAPPα might exert its effect on synaptic transmission by interfering with a complex of full-length APP and GABABR1a. In neurons lacking APP however, sAPPα still reduced mEPSC and mIPSC frequency (Fig. S6A,B), excluding this possibility. Application of 30 μM baclofen similarly reduced mEPSC and mIPSC frequency in App/Aplp1 dKO cultures (Fig. S6C,D) as in WT cultures (Fig. 3C, S5B), suggesting that the absence of full-length APP does not cause major alterations in GABABR localization to presynaptic terminals. However, the possibility that full-length APP also interacts with and affects GABABR signaling separate from the effects of sAPPα reported here cannot be excluded.

The decrease in mEPSC frequency but not amplitude following acute sAPPα application suggests a change in presynaptic release properties. We therefore assessed the effect of sAPPα on presynaptic vesicle recycling using the fluorescent membrane dye FM1–43. We measured presynaptic strength by measuring the density (D) of FM+ boutons per image area and the change in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) of FM1–43 signals at individual boutons of cultured hippocampal neurons using a combined FM1–43 loading/unloading stimulation paradigm (Fig. 3F). Application of sAPPα decreased the total presynaptic strength (S = ΔF × D) across synaptic populations (Fig. 3G, S7A) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3H), reaching 57 ± 7 % (n=8 experiments; P &lt; 0.001) reduction at 1 μM sAPPα. This decrease was not observed with deletion of the ExD (sAPPαΔExD, 1 μM) (Fig. 3H, S7B) and was occluded by the GABABR antagonist CGP54626 (CGP, 10μM) (Fig 3I, S7C), indicating that GABABR1a mediates the presynaptic inhibition induced by sAPPα.

sAPP enhances short-term plasticity at Schaffer collateral synapses in a GABABR1a-dependent manner

We next assessed the effect of sAPPα on synaptic transmission in an intact circuit at CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses, which exclusively contain GABABR1a receptors (32). We measured field EPSPs (fEPSPs) evoked by low frequency stimulation (0.1 Hz) at varying intensities (30–150 μA) in CA1 stratum radiatum after 90 min pre-incubation of acute hippocampal slices with or without 1 μM sAPPα (Fig 4A). Treatment with sAPPα reduced fEPSP amplitude and decreased the slope of the input/output (i/o) curve by 23% (Fig. S8A), indicating that sAPPα suppresses basal synaptic transmission at SC synapses. To specifically assess if sAPPα affects presynaptic properties, we applied a burst of 5 stimuli at 3 different frequencies (20, 50, and 100 Hz) to induce short-term facilitation, which inversely correlates with the probability of neurotransmitter release. Facilitation was higher for each frequency tested in sAPPα-incubated compared to control slices (Fig. 4B, S8B,C). Analysis of the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) for the first 2 stimuli showed an increased PPR for each frequency following sAPPα treatment (Fig. 4C), indicating a decreased release probability. Deletion of the ExD (sAPPαΔExD 1 μM) abolished the sAPPα-mediated effect on the i/o curve (Fig. S9D), short-term facilitation (Fig. 4D, S8E,F), and PPR (Fig. 4E). In addition, preincubation of slices with the GABABR antagonist CGP54626 (CGP, 10 μM) abolished the sAPPα-mediated decrease in the slope of the i/o curve (Fig. S8G) and occluded the sAPPα-induced increase in short-term facilitation and PPR at each frequency (Fig. 4F,G, S8H,I), demonstrating GABABR-dependence of these effects. Altogether, these results indicate that sAPPα controls vesicle release at SC synapses by acting on presynaptic GABABR1a.

A short peptide within the APP ExD suppresses synaptic vesicle release via GABABR1a

A GABABR1a isoform-specific modulator has potential therapeutic implications for a number of neurological disorders involving GABABR signaling (29). Since we observed that purified protein corresponding to the linker region of APP (Fig. 2A) was sufficient to mimic the effects of sAPPα on mEPSC frequency (Fig. 3D), we set out to identify the minimally active region within the ExD. Alignment of the sAPP ExD (amino acids (AA) 195–227 of APP695) from seven vertebrate species revealed the strongest conservation within a 17AA stretch (204–220AA; Fig. 5A). The corresponding synthetic APP 17mer peptide bound sushi 1 of GABABR1a with a KD of 810nM (Fig. 5B), in the same range as the binding affinity of the entire linker region (Fig. 2C). Shortening the peptide to a synthetic 9mer consisting of APP695 residues 204–212 (APP 9mer) lowered the KD to 2.3 μM (Fig. 5C); whereas residues 211–220 failed to bind sushi 1 (Fig. S9A). Thus, a conserved, minimal 9AA sequence within the sAPP ExD is sufficient for direct binding to the sushi 1 domain of GABABR1a.

To gain further insight in the binding of the APP 9mer to the GABABR1a sushi 1 domain, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As previously reported (40), we observed that the sushi 1 domain of GABABR1a is natively unstructured (Fig. S9B). Strikingly, APP 9mer binding stabilized the sushi 1 domain of GABABR1a, allowing determination of its solution structure (Figure 5D, S9C) and generation of a structural model of the complex (Fig. 5E). In our model, a valine and tryptophan at 208–209AA of APP695 bind within a pocket of sushi 1, formed by the loops and the short beta-strand in the N-terminal part of the protein (32–53 AA of full-length GABABR1a) (Fig. S9D). Thus, APP binding induces a conformational change in the natively unstructured sushi 1 domain of GABABR1a. This structure-function relationship strongly supports the physiological relevance of the interaction.

As the affinity for sushi 1 was better retained in the APP 17mer compared to the 9mer (Fig. 5B,C), we next tested whether the APP 17mer could functionally mimic sAPPα. Acute application of the APP 17mer peptide, but not of a scrambled 17mer control peptide, reduced mEPSC frequency in hippocampal neurons to a similar degree as sAPPα (Fig. 5F, S9E) and was already apparent at 25 nM (Fig. S9F). Pretreatment with the GABABR antagonist CGP55845 (CGP, 5μM) blocks this effect (Fig. 5G, S9G). Together, these findings show that the APP 17mer peptide mimics the effects of sAPPα on GABABR1a-dependent inhibition of synaptic vesicle release.

APP 17mer peptide suppresses neuronal activity of CA1 pyramidal cells in vivo

In the final series of experiments, we utilized the APP 17mer peptide as a tool to examine the effects of sAPP-GABABR signaling on neuronal activity in vivo. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we measured calcium transients of CA1 hippocampal neurons in anesthetized Thy1-GCaMP6s mice before (baseline) and after a 60–90 min superfusion of the exposed hippocampus with either baclofen (30 μM), APP 17mer (5μM), or scrambled 17mer control peptide (5μM) (Fig. 6A). Application of 30 μM baclofen caused a dramatic decrease in the frequency of calcium transients compared to baseline (Fig. S10A-C), indicating that activation of GABABRs strongly suppresses neuronal activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vivo. Consistent with our results in cultured hippocampal neurons, application of the APP 17mer significantly reduced the frequency of calcium transients compared to baseline (Fig. 6B-D, Movie S1). The frequency of calcium transients was restored back to baseline following a two-hour wash-out of the peptide (Fig. S10D-F), indicating that the suppression of CA1 neuron activity by the APP 17mer peptide is reversible. Furthermore, the scrambled 17mer control peptide did not affect the frequency of calcium transients (Fig. 6E-G; S10G-I, Movie S2). Together, these results indicate that APP inhibits neuronal activity in vivo and that the GABABR1a binding domain is sufficient for such inhibition.

Discussion

Our studies reveal that sAPP acts as a GABABR1a-specific ligand to suppress synaptic vesicle release. Consequently, sAPP modulates hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission in vivo. APP is among the most abundant proteins in synaptic boutons (25), and deletion of App in mice leads to synaptic deficits (7–9, 21, 22). Synaptic activity enhances proteolytic processing of APP (41, 42) and GABABR is a key regulator of homeostatic synaptic plasticity (43). Hence, our observations raise the possibility that the sAPP-GABABR1a interaction acts as an activity-dependent negative feedback mechanism to suppress synaptic release and maintain proper homeostatic control of neural circuits. While AD-causing mutations in APP all affect Aβ generation, it is not entirely clear whether other aspects of APP function contribute to AD. Network abnormalities such as hyperexcitability and hypersynchronization precede clinical onset of AD in human patients (44). Some studies indicate that sAPP levels may be altered in AD (14). Interestingly, a GABABR antagonist has been shown to improve memory in animal models and patients with mild cognitive impairment (45–47). Moreover, as most transgenic AD mouse models overexpress sAPP, the role of sAPP in synaptic phenotypes of transgenic APP mice should be considered, particularly given evidence that network hyperexcitability in these mice is independent of Aβ production (48).

GABABR signaling has been implicated in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including epilepsy, depression, addiction, and schizophrenia (49). Selective binding partners of the GABABR1a sushi domains are of potential therapeutic interest due to localization and functional differences of GABABR1 isoforms (32, 50) as well as the adverse effects of current non-specific agonists (29). The identification of sAPP as a functional GABABR1a-specific binding partner provides a target for the development of therapeutic strategies for modulating GABABR1a-specific signaling in neurological and psychiatric disorders. The identification of short APP peptides that confer structure in the GABABR1a sushi 1 domain and modulate neurotransmission in vivo are major steps towards development of a GABABR1a isoform-specific therapeutic.

Summary of Methods

To identify candidate synaptic interactors for sAPP, affinity purification experiments were performed using recombinant sAPP-Fc to pull down interacting proteins from synaptosome extracts, followed by mass spectrometric analysis of bound proteins. Cell surface binding assays, biolayer interferometry, and isothermal titration calorimetry were used to determine domains of interaction and apparent binding affinities between sAPP to GABABR. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to generate a structural model of the APP-GABABR complex. The function of the sAPP-GABABR interaction was investigated by accessing spontaneous postsynaptic currents and FM1–43 dye labeling in mouse hippocampal cultures, short-term facilitation in acute hippocampal slices, and 2-photon in vivo calcium imaging in CA1 hippocampus of anesthetized Thy1-GCaMP6 mice. The details of each of these methods are described in the supplementary materials.
