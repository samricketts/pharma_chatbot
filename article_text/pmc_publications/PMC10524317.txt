INTRODUCTION:

The associations between subjective cognitive decline (SCD), cognition, and amyloid were explored across diverse participants in the A4 study.

METHODS:

5151 non-Hispanic White, 262 non-Hispanic Black, 179 Hispanic-White, and 225 Asian participants completed the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC), self- and study partner-reported Cognitive Function Index (CFI). A subsample underwent amyloid PET (18F-florbetapir) (N=4384). We examined self-reported CFI, PACC, amyloid, and study partner-reported CFI by ethnoracial group.

RESULTS:

The associations between PACC-CFI and amyloid-CFI were moderated by race. The relationships were weaker or non-significant in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White groups. Depression and anxiety scores were stronger predictors of CFI in these groups. Despite group differences in the types of study partners, self- and study partner-CFI were congruent across groups.

DISCUSSION:

SCD may not uniformly relate to cognition or AD biomarkers in different ethnoracial groups. Nonetheless, self- and study partner-SCD were congruent despite differences in study partner type.

pmc1. Background

Detecting the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the era of disease modifying treatments is imperative. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) may represent one of the earliest symptoms of AD but is understudied across ethnoracial groups. Understanding the role of SCD may be particularly relevant given evidence of increased risk of dementia among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults relative to non-Hispanic Whites [1, 2]. Furthermore, there are scarce studies to date that evaluate the association of SCD and AD biomarkers across diverse samples.

SCD describes the self-perceived experience of cognitive changes in the setting of normal cognitive performance [3,4]. Previous work has shown a relationship between SCD and AD biomarkers, including patterns of neurodegeneration [5,6,7], greater amyloid [8,9], and tau burden [10]. Studies examining the relationship between SCD and objective cognition have been somewhat mixed, but generally show that SCD is modestly related to worse objective cognitive performance [11,12]. Little is known as to whether SCD is a valuable indicator of early cognitive change among various ethnoracial populations, as prior work has largely been conducted in predominately white samples [12].

There is a well-established pattern of observed differences in standardized cognitive performance across ethnoracial groups, raising concern for bias in traditional standardized assessments [13,14]. Therefore, understanding the relationship between SCD, objective cognition and amyloid across these groups may illuminate whether markers of early cognitive decline identified in White samples perform similarly among underrepresented groups. Evidence, to date, is largely mixed. Some studies show a similar relationship between objective and subjective cognition in minoritized groups [15]. Others show no association in Black and Hispanic adults, or that SCD is more strongly related to measures of psychological wellbeing than to objective cognitive performance [16,17,18]. Furthermore, there are limited studies to date that evaluate if SCD is similarly related to amyloid accumulation in these groups.

In addition to self-report of SCD, the subjective report from a close family member or friend (study partner-report) can provide a complementary perspective on early cognitive changes, [3,19], and is also associated with amyloid burden in preclinical AD [20, 9]. Previous studies have demonstrated variability in study partner demographics in the A4 study [21], and it remains unknown how study partner-report and self-report of SCD correspond across ethnoracial groups.

In this study we sought to understand how objective cognitive performance functions in relation to self-reported SCD in a diverse sample screened for the Anti-Amyloid in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease (A4) study. Specifically, we sought to 1) examine the association between objective cognition and SCD across groups, 2) examine the association of amyloid to SCD across groups for those who completed PET imaging, 3) examine characteristics of study partners and the association between self- and study partner report of SCD, and 4) explore possible contributors to the reporting of SCD across this diverse sample. In this way, we sought to better understand if SCD is uniformly valuable as an early indicator of cognitive change and disease risk across ethnoracial groups.

2. Methods

2.1 Participants

This study included individuals screened for the Anti-Amyloid in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Disease (A4) study. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial that enrolls cognitively normal older adults with amyloid accumulation on PET imaging to evaluate the efficacy of solanezumab in slowing the progression of cognitive impairment. Recruitment for A4 included centralized and local strategies, including internal sources (e.g., community outreach, investigators’ clinical practice, site databases), outside physician referrals, organizational referrals, paid advertisements, or earned media (i.e., news or other non-paid content for TV, radio, print or web). Screened participants were determined to be cognitively normal if they obtained scores on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) of ≥ 25, a global rating of 0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), and scaled scores of ≥ 6 on the Logical Memory subtest. Based on these criteria, eligible participants went on to complete PET imaging to determine amyloid status.

Included participants self-identified as non-Hispanic White (n = 5151), non-Hispanic Black (n = 262), Hispanic White (n = 179), or Asian (n =225) (See Table 1). American Indian/Native Alaskan (n = 9), Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (n = 2), Black Hispanic (n = 5), and Asian Hispanic (n = 1) participants were not included in these analyses given small group size. Individuals with unknown/unreported race (n = 26) or ethnicity (n = 34) were also excluded, and there were 27 participants with missing race data. Hispanic participants were administered study assessments in English or Spanish. In the Asian sample, a proportion of participants were screened in Japan and study assessments were administered in English or Japanese.

2.2 Cognitive performance and subjective cognitive decline

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) was assessed using self- and study partner-report on the Cognitive Function Index (CFI) [22]. This is a 14-item questionnaire with items addressing decline in the past year, and problems with various cognitive and functional tasks. Responses were recorded as ‘Yes’=1, ‘No’=0, or ‘Maybe’=0.5 and summed to create total scores for participant and study partner-report of SCD. Higher scores on the CFI indicate worse subjective cognitive functioning or greater SCD.

Objective cognitive performance was assessed using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC). This composite compiles z-scores calculated from the MMSE Total Score, Paragraph Story Recall (Delayed Recall), Digit Symbol Coding, and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). Higher z-score values on the PACC indicate better cognitive performance.

Participants completed the short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a 15-item assessment to screen for depression in older adults, with higher scores indicating greater severity [23]. The six-item subset of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI-AD) was used to assess anxiety, with higher scores associated with greater anxiety symptoms [24].

2.3 PET Imaging

Cortical amyloid was visualized with 18F-florbetapir PET using a previously published PET processing stream [25]. Analyses were conducted with both a continuous measure of mean global cortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and a dichotomous cortical amyloid cut-off, which classified participants into amyloid positive (cutoff of ≥1.15) and amyloid negative groups.

2.4 Statistical analysis

Analyses examining PACC and study partner CFI were conducted in the largest sample available of screened participants to maximize sample size of participants from underrepresented groups (n= 5812). Analyses including amyloid were conducted in the subset of PET-eligible individuals (n= 4384). APOE ε4 status was collected for available participants and evaluated secondarily for its potential influence on primary analyses (n = 5197). Differences across groups on key variables were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Participant age, education, and sex, GDS, and STAI were controlled for in each regression model.

2.4.1 Between-group analyses

Self-report CFI and PACC

Linear regression analysis (R version 4.1.2) was used to test the interaction of PACC score and ethnoracial group predicting self-report CFI to evaluate differences in the association between self-report CFI and PACC across groups. This model was additionally conducted while controlling for APOEε4 status to determine the potential role of variability in APOEε4 carriership across groups.

Self-report CFI and amyloid

These analyses were conducted in the subsample of participants who underwent amyloid PET. We tested the interaction of amyloid by ethnoracial group predicting self-reported CFI, to evaluate differences in the amyloid-CFI relationship between ethnoracial groups. These models were conducted with dichotomous amyloid status, primarily, and with continuous SUVR. These models were additionally conducted while controlling for APOEε4 status.

2.4.2 Within-group analyses

Where between group analyses speak the relative strength of this relationship when compared to other groups, we were also interested in understanding the unique associations of PACC, amyloid and CFI independently within each group. Thus, we evaluated the association between PACC and CFI, as well as amyloid status and CFI in independent, within-group regression models.

We additionally explored the extent to which language of administration influenced the association of PACC and CFI. Language of administration uniquely impacted the Asian and Hispanic White samples; thus, we explored the effect of language of administration on key variables, and on within-group analysis for these groups.

2.4.3 Study partner demographics

We examined the demographic features of study partners across each group, including sex and type of relationship to participant (i.e., spouse, adult child, friend/companion, child-in-law, other relative, paid caregiver, and other). Race, ethnicity, and educational attainment of study partners were not collected. Row-wise Fisher’s exact tests were conducted to evaluate differences in the proportion of each study partner type between the ethnoracial groups. Due to multiple comparisons between the 4 groups on each of the 7 levels of this variable, FDR adjusted p-values were used in these analyses.

2.4.4 Self-report CFI and study partner-report CFI

Using linear regression analyses, we tested the interaction of study partner-reported CFI and race on self-reported CFI, to evaluate if self-reported CFI and study partner-reported CFI differed across ethnoracial groups.

3. Results

3.1 Sample Characteristics

Table 1 displays demographic data for the overall sample. Groups differed in age between the Asian and non-Hispanic Black sample (p &lt;.01), and years of education, as non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White participants displayed lower education relative to non-Hispanic White and Asian groups. (p &lt;.001). Groups also differed in proportion of female participants (p&lt;.001). Non-Hispanic Black participants displayed the greatest proportion of APOEε4 carriers (37%), while the Asian participants displayed the lowest (22%). The Asian sample had significantly lower APOE ε4 carriership relative to the non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White samples (p &lt; .001).

Regarding key variables, non-Hispanic Black and Asian participants had significantly lower cortical amyloid than the non-Hispanic White group (F (3, 4380) = 7.67, p &lt;.001). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White participants demonstrated lower PACC scores relative to non-Hispanic White and Asian groups (F (3, 5788) = 50.12, p &lt;.001). The Asian sample endorsed significantly higher CFI scores relative to all other groups, and the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White participants endorsed higher CFI relative to the non-Hispanic White sample (F (3, 5813) = 36.71, p &lt;.001). Study partner-reported CFI also differed, with Hispanic White and Asian study partners endorsing significantly higher CFI relative to the White sample ((F (3,5798) =15.34, p &lt;.001; Table 1).

Proportions of study partner types also differed by group (Table 2). Results of FDR adjusted row-wise Fisher’s exact tests revealed the non-Hispanic Black sample had significantly fewer spouses (32%), but significantly greater ‘friends/companions’ (32%) and ‘other relatives’ (16%) serving as study partners relative to all other groups. Hispanic participants had more spouses, but fewer adult children relative to the non-Hispanic White group.

3.2 Association of CFI and PACC between ethnoracial groups

In between-group analysis, there was a significant interaction of ethnoracial group and PACC score predicting CFI, as the association in the Hispanic White group was significantly weaker than that of the non-Hispanic White (β= 0.105, SE = 0.049, p &lt; .05) and Asian groups (β= 0.185, SE = 0.067, p &lt; .01) (Figure 1). The association between PACC-CFI was not significantly different among the non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, and Asian groups, where greater lower PACC score was associated with higher self-reported CFI. This result was replicated when controlling for APOE ε4 status, despite proportional differences in APOE ε4 carriers across groups.

3.3 Association of amyloid and SCD between ethnoracial groups

In the PET-imaged sample (n = 4384), there was a significant interaction of ethnoracial group and amyloid positivity when predicting CFI. The association was weaker in the non-Hispanic Black group relative to the Asian sample (β= −0.132, SE = 0.057, p &lt; .05). There were no significant differences in this association between the Hispanic White, non-Hispanic White, and Asian groups, where amyloid positivity was associated with greater CFI. These findings were replicated when controlling for APOE ε4 status. Using amyloid SUVR in place of dichotomous there was no significant interaction between the groups (Figure 2).

3.4 Association of PACC and CFI within ethnoracial groups

In within-group analyses, lower PACC performance was significantly associated with higher self-reported CFI in non-Hispanic White (β= −0.107, SE = 0.011, p &lt; .0001) and Asian samples (β= −0.205, SE = 0.060 p &lt; .0001). PACC was not associated with CFI in the Hispanic White (β= 0.044, SE = 0.063, p = .48), and non-Hispanic Black samples (β= −0.099, SE = 0.060, p = .10). Notably, GDS and STAI were the only significant predictors of CFI in the Hispanic sample and GDS was the only predictor of CFI in the non-Hispanic Black sample. These findings were replicated when controlling for APOE ε4 status.

3.4.1 Influence of language of administration on PACC and CFI

In the Asian sample (n = 225), 120 participants (53.3%) had assessments conducted in Japanese. There were no differences in Japanese versus English speakers in age, (F (1,223) =.168, p =.68), self-reported CFI (F (1,223) =.236, p =.62), study partner-reported CFI (F (1,219) =.346, p =.56), PACC performance (F (1,221) =2.61, p =.11), or cortical amyloid (F (1,168) =1.02, p =.31). The groups differed in years of education and MMSE score, as the Japanese sample had lower mean years of education (F (1,223) = 51.8, p &lt; .001), but higher MMSE scores (F(1,222)=4.43, p &lt; .05) compared to the English-speaking Asian sample. In the Hispanic White sample (n = 179), 21 participants (11.7%) were administered assessments in Spanish. Spanish and English speakers did not differ in age, (F (1,177) =3.34, p = .06), years of education (F (1, 177) =.327, p =.57), MMSE score (F (1,176) =.024, p =.88), or cortical amyloid (F (1,114) =2.57, p=.11). Spanish-speaking participants had higher self-reported CFI (F (1,177) =6.98, p &lt; .05), higher study partner-reported CFI (F (1,176) = 42.1, p &lt; .001), and lower mean PACC performance (F (1,176) = 5.38, p &lt; .05). In within-group analyses controlling for language, findings remained unchanged in the Hispanic White and Asian groups. Specifically, PACC was a significant predictor of CFI in the Asian group (β= −0.212, SE = 0.06, p &lt; .001). In the Hispanic White group, PACC remains non-significant when predicting CFI (β= 0.040, SE = 0.063, p = .52). Language was not a significant predictor in either model (Asian: β= 0.126, SE = 0.201, p = .53; Hispanic White: β= 0.785, SE = 0.663, p = .24)

3.5 Association between amyloid and SCD within ethnoracial groups

In within-group regression analysis, amyloid positivity was associated with greater self-report of CFI in non-Hispanic White (β=0.432, SE = 0.066, p &lt; .001) and Asian groups (β= 1.01, SE = 0.465 p &lt; .05), but not in the non-Hispanic Black (β= −0.370, SE = 0.461, p = .41) or Hispanic White groups (β= 0.099, SE = 0.465, p =.83). Again, in within-group analyses, GDS and STAI were sole predictors of CFI in the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White groups. These findings were replicated with continuous SUVR in place of dichotomous amyloid status. Controlling for APOE ε4 status did not alter these findings with dichotomous or continuous amyloid.

3.6 Concordance between self- and study partner-reported SCD

Across all ethnoracial groups, self- and study partner-report on the CFI were positively correlated (Table 3). In regression analysis, the significant self- and study partner-report CFI relationship (β=0.274, SE = 0.015, p &lt; .001) was not modified by ethnoracial group when controlling for age, education, sex, GDS, and STAI (Figure 3).

4. Discussion

Our findings revealed differences in the relationship between SCD and cognitive performance across ethnoracial groups, in part due to the apparent influence of depression and anxiety on SCD reporting among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White participants. The relationship between SCD and amyloid status was also not found in the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White groups, where it was present in non-Hispanic White and Asian participants. Nonetheless, despite variability in demographics and the types of study-partner relationships, reporting of SCD was congruent between participants and study partners. These findings suggest that among diverse participants, SCD measures may not perform similarly with respect to cognition and amyloid, thus further work is needed to understand its utility in predicting AD-related pathological change in these groups.

Evaluating the relationship between objective and subjective cognitive functioning across ethnoracial groups is important given that objective cognitive performance, particularly in underrepresented groups, can be impacted by biases (e.g., based on nonrepresentative normative samples/comparison groups) [26]. More importantly, it has been unclear whether subjective report would align with objective cognitive assessment [16]. Our findings suggest there are differences in the strength of this relationship, particularly in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White groups, where depression and anxiety symptoms appear as stronger predictors of SCD reporting than objective performance. As such, SCD reporting may not be as reflective of cognitive functioning in Black and Hispanic groups, and therefore may be differentially predictive of AD pathological change. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating measures of psychological wellbeing are more strongly associated with SCD in these groups [27, 28] and, recent work demonstrating SCD differences across ethnoracial groups are due in part to various psychosocial and socioeconomic indicators (e.g., nation of birth, income, cardiovascular factors, language preference, etc.) [29]. Furthermore, the relation between SCD and psychological wellbeing among historically underrepresented groups is shown to be influenced by experiences which disproportionally affect these populations (e.g., health disparities, experiences of discrimination etc.) [30, 31]. This suggests these experiences may be one contribution to the observed differences in SCD reporting, which may uniquely influence psychological wellbeing and perceptions of cognitive health.

Properties of SCD measurement tools were also considered as contributing to differences in reporting. There were significant differences in self-reported SCD, with Asian participants reporting greater SCD than all groups, and non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic White participants reporting greater SCD than non-Hispanic Whites. Work in-preparation examining the psychometric properties of the CFI and PACC across racial groups (personal communication, Rabin) did not reveal differential functioning of the CFI across racial groups, which reduces concern that these instruments are not measuring cognitive concerns across groups. Still, we considered potential cultural/linguistic influences that may have been introduced by collecting participants across countries and language groups. In the Asian sample, where a large proportion of participants were collected in Japan, there were no differences in self-reported SCD or objective cognition across language groups, and language of administration did not appear contributory in the models. In the Hispanic White sample, while there were differences in SCD and objective cognition between Spanish vs English speakers, again, language did not alter primary findings. To corroborate this finding, future work in other ethnoracially diverse samples and employing other SCD measurement tools should consider the extent to which sociocultural and linguistic properties of measurement tools (e.g., translations, level of acculturation, etc.), may influence SCD reporting.

Similar to the findings regarding SCD and objective performance, the relationship to amyloid was not found the non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White participants, again raising the possibility that subjective report may not be as specific to AD-related change across different groups. This might suggest there is weaker association of SCD to related AD pathology in these groups. However, it is likely also impacted by the lower proportion of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White participants with elevated amyloid, and relatedly, higher rates of exclusion due to lower cognitive performance in these groups [32]. This underscores the need for larger, more representative samples of historically underrepresented groups in AD research to more clearly disentangle how assessments of subjective cognition relate to AD biomarkers in the population at large.

Interestingly, study partner and self-reported SCD were congruent across groups despite differences in the types of personal relationships that were more common across groups. This important finding is relevant to previous work in the A4 cohort highlighting the variability in study partner demographics, with a higher proportion of non-spousal study partners among the non-Hispanic Black sample [21]. This variability is concerning for discrepancies in the value of study partner-report across groups, and for bias in inclusion of certain groups based on availability of study partners [21]. Our findings suggest this variability in study partner relationships does not impact the concordance of study-partner and self-reported subjective change across groups. It will be interesting to know whether the validity of study partner report remains valid over time among non-spousal partners, as prior work suggests that spousal report may become more predictive of cognition towards later stages of disease [33].

While this sample provides one of the largest cohorts to investigate self- and study partner report across multiple ethnoracial groups, limitations of this study include the relatively small ethnoracial group sizes relative to the large non-Hispanic White sample, and exclusion of some groups. Also, as has been noted previously [32] sample bias may have been introduced when determining PET eligibility, which may have influenced the results examining CFI and amyloid status. We also recognize that our generally broad classifications of race and ethnicity limited our ability to explore within-group heterogeneity, particularly among important psychosocial factors/social determinants of health which were not evaluated in this study.

In conclusion, this work expands upon previous work by evaluating SCD across a large, diverse cohort, and demonstrates differences in the association between SCD, objective cognition, and amyloid across ethnoracial groups. These differences appear due in part to stronger associations to psychological factors among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic White groups. Also importantly, despite these differences and variability in study partner characteristics, study partner-report of SCD is correlated with self-report across groups. Future work is needed to identify factors contributing to differences in the strength of associations between subjective and objective cognition, and the relevance of SCD for predicting AD pathological change across groups.

Association between SCD and amyloid was moderated by ethnoracial group

Depression and anxiety were stronger predictors of SCD in Black and Hispanic groups

Study-partner and self-reported SCD are congruent across groups

Study-partner report was consistent despite difference in study partner types

Research in Context:

Literature Review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional, peer-reviewed sources. Studies thus far in largely white samples show a modest association between SCD and objective cognition. Few studies evaluate this relationship, or the association to amyloid in diverse samples.

Interpretation: Our findings demonstrate the association between SCD, objective cognition, and amyloid varies across ethnoracial groups. Study partner report is congruent across groups despite variability in study partner relationship types.

Future directions: Differences in the strength of the association between SCD, objective cognition, and cortical amyloid were related to stronger associations to psychological factors among Black and Hispanic groups. Future work should focus on factors contributing to differences report of subjective change in more representative samples, and the utility of SCD for predicting AD pathological change across groups.
