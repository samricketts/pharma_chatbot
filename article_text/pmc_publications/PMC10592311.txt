Background:

Previous studies noted that racial/ethnic minority groups were less likely than non-Hispanic White beneficiaries to be included in the assessment of medication utilization measures of Medicare Part D Star Ratings due to restrictive inclusion criteria for measure calculation. This study explored whether adding a measure with less stringent inclusion criteria to Star Ratings can reduce disparities in measure assessment among beneficiaries with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).

Methods:

This cross-sectional study utilized 2017 Medicare databases linked to Area Health Resources Files. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare disparities before and after adding the new measure.

Results:

By adding the new measure, disparities in the odds for assessment inclusion between non-Hispanic White beneficiaries and Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other beneficiaries were respectively reduced by 97% (odds ratio, or OR=1.97, 95% Confidence Interval or CI=1.89–2.05), 72% (OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.58–1.87), 115% (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.87–2.46), and 44% (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.28–1.62).

Conclusions:

To improve the selection of medication utilization measures in Star Ratings among beneficiaries with ADRD, policymakers should investigate the optimal composition of measures to better align the interests of patients, providers, and health plans.

pmc1. Introduction

The share of health care expenditures in the gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States (U.S.) is considerably higher than in any other developed country [1]. In 2020, 18.8% of the U.S. GDP was spent on health care, at least 40 percent more than the expenditure share of any other country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [1]. Yet, the U.S. has trailed behind its international peers in national health and well-being indicators, including life expectancy, chronic disease burden, and suicide rate [2,3]. Previous studies have suggested that the lack of timely access to high-quality care, measured by rates of avoidable mortality and self-reported access problems, remains the main reason for the substandard performance of the U.S. health care system [3,4].

To enhance the quality of health care and resource allocation for achieving better health outcomes, the U.S. federal government has initiated numerous pay-for-performance and public reporting programs in recent years [5,6]. A program that has gained in significance over time is the Star Ratings (Star Ratings, hereafter) program for Medicare Parts C (Medicare Advantage plans) and D (prescription drug plans). Established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2007, the Star Ratings program has been utilized as a policy instrument for providing timely information at enrollment to Medicare beneficiaries and for improving the health care quality of the older adult population through incentivized federal bonus payments [7].

In the Star Ratings program, the CMS assesses the performance of health care plans on an annual basis by computing and assigning star values for various performance measures in Medicare Part C and Part D [8,9]. These measures fall under nine domains such as customer service, member complaints and performance changes, member experience, and drug safety and pricing for Part D plans [10]. Each measure is assessed on a rating scale ranging from one to five stars, with a higher rating indicating better quality. The scores of individual measures are then utilized to derive plan ratings. The individual measure and component ratings, along with the overall plan performance ratings, are subsequently made available on CMS Medicare Plan Finder website to inform beneficiaries’ enrollment decisions. To provide financial rewards to healthcare stakeholders demonstrating a higher quality of health care provision, MAPDs scoring above a predetermined overall performance threshold are rewarded with bonus payments starting from 2012 [11]. In 2021, approximately $11.6 billion in bonus payments were awarded to MAPD plans [12]. In addition to the financial incentives, the Star Ratings program also incorporates non-financial incentives: Plans that achieve a 5-star rating are granted expanded enrollment privileges, allowing them to enroll beneficiaries throughout the year, while other plans can only enroll during the annual open enrollment period [13]; plans with ratings below 3 stars for three consecutive years are subject to having their contracts terminated by the CMS [14].

While the Star Ratings program holds promise for improving health care quality, previous literature has noted that the program may exacerbate racial/ethnic disparities in patients’ health outcomes [15–18]. Specifically, past studies have found that racial/ethnic minority patients among various Medicare populations had a lower likelihood of inclusion in the assessment of Part D medication utilization measures compared to their non-Hispanic White (White, hereafter) counterparts [15–18]. This may be because minority patients are generally more likely to exhibit certain characteristics, including having lower prescription fills, reliance on insulin, and a higher prevalence of end-stage renal disease, which lowers their likelihood of meeting the inclusion criteria for measurement assessment [15,16,18]. Thus, Health plans are more likely to provide health services to patients meeting the Star Ratings inclusion criteria than those who do not, thereby exacerbating any potential disparities in health outcomes between the two groups. This disparity may be critical and pronounced for racial/ethnic minority patients within the Medicare population affected by Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Notably, Black and Hispanic beneficiaries were approximately 1.5 times more likely to have ADRD than White beneficiaries [19]. In addition, compared to beneficiaries without ADRD, those with ADRD were found 2.7 times more likely to have greater than three other chronic conditions with more significant needs for health care [20].

A previous study examined strategies to address racial/ethnic disparities in the likelihood of being included in Part D Star Ratings among the Medicare fee-for-service population [21]. Disparities in the likelihood of inclusion in Part D Star Ratings imply inequity as they represent a systematic bias in how quality care is measured and provided [22]. Given the more vulnerable nature of Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD and the potential impact of the Star Ratings program on services provided by health plans, an investigation of the solutions to the disparity implications of the Star Ratings program in this population is merited. Thus, this study assessed whether adding to Star Ratings medication utilization measures with less stringent criteria for inclusion in assessment can reduce the aforementioned potential disparities in Star Ratings. For the international audience, such research may serve as a model for addressing disparities in their countries.

2. Methods

2.1 Data source

This retrospective, cross-sectional analysis utilized 100% of the available Medicare data for 2017 and incorporated the Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) [23,24]. Medicare databases supplied beneficiary-level information and comprised the Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF), Parts A (inpatient care) and B (outpatient/physician services) claim files, and Part D Event file [23]. Patient-level information on demographic, plan enrollment, and mortality was obtained from the MBSF. Diagnosis and medical service records were collected from Parts A and B claims. Drug names, national drug codes, fill dates, and days supply for all Part D prescriptions were derived from the Part D Event file. Data at the county level pertaining to the socioeconomic characteristics of the population and healthcare resources available for the residence of each beneficiary were provided by the AHRF [24].

2.2 Study sample

The study population was restricted to Medicare beneficiaries who met some inclusion requirements: (1) had a minimum of one medical claim indicating an ADRD diagnosis from 2014 through 2017; (2) reached a minimum age of 65 years by the start of 2017; (3) continuously received coverage for Parts A, B, and D; (4) filled at least one prescription for medication targeting diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia in 2017; and (5) did not die by the end of 2017. Given that their claims may be incomplete or missing, beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans were not included in the study sample.

The algorithm employed in this study to identify beneficiaries with ADRD was formulated by the CMS Chronic Condition Warehouse (CCW) [25]. This algorithm determined ADRD diagnosis based on claims from inpatient, home health agencies, skilled nurse facilities, outpatient, and carrier settings. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes for ADRD were identified over a 3-year lookback period [25]. This method represents the state of science, although it cannot identify all patients with ADRD [26]. A complete list of the ICD-9-CM codes and ICD-10-CM codes for ADRD can be found under the disease category “Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders or Senile Dementia” in the CCW documentation [25]. The medications for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were identified based on the medication lists in the 2019 Part C &amp; D Medicare Star Ratings Data [10].

2.3 Inclusion in the measure assessment of Star Ratings and Star Plus

For the Part D Star Ratings in 2019, the measures of medication utilization included the following: adherence to diabetes medications, adherence to hypertension medications, adherence to hyperlipidemia medications, and statin use in individuals with diabetes. The 2019 measures were examined instead of the 2017 ones because there is a two-year lag between when claims were collected and when Star Ratings scores based on the evaluation of those data were publicly disclosed [10,11]. Accordingly, the 2019 CMS Part D technical notes and medication lists were employed when assessing the inclusion criteria for each measure [10]. All four measures required beneficiaries to meet some criteria for inclusion in the assessment: (1) filled a minimum of two prescriptions for any eligible medications on distinct dates; (2) were not enrolled in hospice; and (3) lacked coverage or a diagnosis for end-stage renal disease. Another common criterion for the three adherence measures was that the first prescription had to be filled at a minimum of 91 days before the end of 2017. Furthermore, the adherence measure for diabetes excluded beneficiaries with prescription fills for insulin, while the adherence measure for hypertension excluded those with fills for medications containing sacubitril and valsartan. The measure for statin use in individuals with diabetes also had an additional criterion requiring beneficiaries to be less than or equal to 75 years of age. Prescription fills for some therapeutic categories were included in the computation: oral diabetic medications for the measure of adherence to diabetes treatment, renin angiotensin receptor antagonists for the measure of adherence to hypertension treatment, statins for the measure of adherence to hyperlipidemia treatment, and any diabetic medications for the measure of statin use in individuals with diabetes.

An additional medication utilization measure in the Star Ratings program, high-risk medications, was then added to the four measures in Star Ratings, and the totality of the measures was dubbed Star Plus. The measure of high-risk medication was chosen because it has the least stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria among all past and current medication utilization measures used in the program for Part D at the time of this analysis. This measure required beneficiaries to be at least 65 years of age and not to enroll in hospice for inclusion in the measure assessment [10]. Incorporating this measure can potentially include a larger share of racial/ethnic minority patients than the Star Ratings program, as this measure does not have an inclusion criterion based on medication utilization [10,15]. It is worth noting that CMS retired the high-risk medications measure in 2021 due to an overlap between the high-risk medications measure and a newly introduced medication safety measures, polypharmacy, in Part D Star Ratings [27]. However, using high-risk medications in the analysis can serve as an example of a measure with a less stringent inclusion criterion than Star Ratings measures.

2.4 Racial and ethnic groups

The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) race code in the MBSF was utilized to determine race and ethnicity in this study. The RTI race code has demonstrated greater accuracy in discerning White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (Asian, hereafter) beneficiaries than the race/ethnicity information derived from Social Security Administration records in the Medicare enrollment database [28]. The current analysis focused on five distinct racial/ethnic groups: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other (American Indian/Alaska Native, unknown, and other races/ethnicities) beneficiaries. To address the lower precision of the RTI race code in identifying American Indian and Alaska Native beneficiaries, these minority groups were merged with patients classified as having unknown and other races/ethnicities [28].

2.5 Outcomes

Beneficiaries were assigned a value of one if they were not included in Star Ratings but included in Star Plus, and zero if they were included in neither Star Ratings nor Star Plus.

2.6 Theoretical framework

Because the study outcomes were related to medication utilization, Gelberg-Anderson’s Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations was adopted as the theoretical framework in this study [29]. This model identifies factors linked to the utilization of health services among vulnerable patient populations and classifies them into domains pertinent to explicating realized utilization patterns. Predisposing factors affect the propensity of individuals to seek health services. Enabling factors play a role in either facilitating or impeding access to health service utilization. Need factors characterize the perceived or actual health needs of individuals. The selection of independent variables for the regression analysis was informed by Gelberg-Anderson’s model. Patient-level predisposing factors consisted of race/ethnicity, age, and gender. Predisposing factors assessed at the county level comprised the proportions of married-couple families, individuals with a high school or higher education, and population without health insurance, in addition to per-capita income. Enabling factors encompassed indicator variables pertaining to Medicaid enrollment, metropolitan statistical area, Health Professional Shortage Area, and census regions. The need factor incorporated a risk adjustment summary score devised by the CMS to appropriately adjust the payments made to Part C plans [30]. The calculation of this score primarily relies on beneficiary diagnosis records, where higher scores signify worse health status.

2.7 Statistical analysis

The descriptive analysis first included pairwise comparisons between White beneficiaries and racial/ethnic minority groups regarding patient characteristics and study outcomes. An independent t-test was conducted to analyze continuous variables, while a chi-square test was employed for categorical variables. Next, potential disparities concerning the assessment of Star Ratings measures were assessed by contrasting the inclusion outcomes for White beneficiaries with those for the minority groups in regression analysis. Disparities were defined as significant differences in outcomes between Whites and minority groups after accounting for the effects of other covariates in the regression. Using White beneficiaries as the reference group, a multivariable logistic model was employed to test whether disparate relative inclusion in Star Ratings measure assessment occurred in the study period. If the estimate for the odds ratio (OR) of a minority dummy was both statistically significant and lower than one, it would signify that the likelihood of inclusion concerning Star Ratings measure assessment was lower for the minority group compared to White patients.

Lastly, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess if Star Plus was associated with reduced disparities in comparison to Star Ratings. Because Star Plus comprised all of the Star Ratings measures, a comparison of category one (not included in Star Ratings but included in Star Plus) versus category zero (included in neither Star Ratings nor Star Plus) reflects the likelihood of inclusion in the assessment of additional medication utilization measure in Star Plus among patients who were not included in Star Ratings assessment. An OR of a minority dummy variable over one would suggest that Star Plus was associated with a reduction in disparities concerning inclusion in measure assessment.

For each regression analysis, need-based and demand-based perspectives were utilized to evaluate whether racial/ethnic disparities or improvements in observed disparities reflected differences in factors that might impact the need or demand for health services [31]. Race/ethnicity, age, gender, and risk adjustment summary score were the adjusted variables in the need-based specification. The demand-based specification adjusted for all factors in Gelberg-Anderson’s framework. To allow for potential correlation within each county, standard errors of the regression coefficients were clustered at the county level.

A two-sided alpha value set at 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. All analyses were conducted on the CMS Virtual Research Data Center employing SAS Enterprise Guide version 7.1 (Cary, NC). This study was granted exempt status by the Institutional Review Board at the corresponding author’s institution (approval #21-08349-NHSR). Requirement for consent was waivered.

3. Results

Beneficiary characteristics were compared across race/ethnicity in Table 1. The final analytic sample comprised 1,455,059 Medicare beneficiaries identified with ADRD, including 78.01% White, 10.01% Black, 7.06% Hispanic, 3.32% Asian, and 1.59% Other. There are significant differences in population characteristics between racial and ethnic minority groups and the White population: minorities generally were younger, less likely to be male, more likely to receive Medicaid, and lived in areas with lower socioeconomic status, with some exceptions. For example, Black and Hispanic beneficiaries were younger (p&lt;0.0001) and less likely to be male (p&lt;0.05) than White beneficiaries; among community-level characteristics, Black and Hispanic patients resided in counties with lower proportions of married-couple families (p&lt;0.0001), lower proportions of individuals with a high school or higher education (p&lt;0.0001), and higher proportions of uninsured individuals (p&lt;0.001); Asian (p&lt;0.0001) and Other beneficiaries (p&lt;0.05) stayed in counties with higher per capita income; Each minority group had a higher likelihood than White patients of enrolling in Medicaid (p&lt;0.0001); Black and Hispanic beneficiaries were more likely to live in the metropolitan statistical area and Health Professional Shortage Area (p&lt;0.0001). Geographically, Black beneficiaries had a higher likelihood of residing in the South than in Northeast regions compared to their White counterparts. In contrast, Hispanic and Asian beneficiaries displayed a higher tendency to be in the South/West and West regions, respectively. Finally, Black (p&lt;0.0001), Hispanic (p&lt;0.0001), and Other beneficiaries (p&lt;0.05) had risk adjustment summary scores greater than White beneficiaries.

Table 2a reports the percentages of beneficiaries included in the measure assessment of Star Ratings across race/ethnicity. White beneficiaries exhibited a significantly higher percentage of inclusion in at least one measure assessment than each racial/ethnic minority group. Compared with 86.30% of White beneficiaries, the percentages of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other beneficiaries included in the measure assessment were respectively 79.45% (p&lt;0.0001), 83.03% (p&lt;0.0001), 85.84% (p&lt;0.05), and 85.49% (p&lt;0.01). Table 2b compares the percentages of beneficiaries included in the measure assessment of Star Ratings and Star Plus across race/ethnicity. The percentages of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other beneficiaries not included in the Star Ratings measure assessment but included in that of Star Plus were 68.43%, 81.63%, 78.62%, 81.27%, and 79.19%, respectively. This suggests that Star Plus may be associated with reduced disparities related to measure assessment for Star Ratings.

The multivariable regression results reported in Table 3 demonstrate patterns of inclusion in Star Ratings measure assessment. Except for Asian patients, significant disparities between White patients and other racial/ethnic minority groups were found. After adjusting for demand-based factors, the likelihood of inclusion in the assessment of Star Ratings measures compared to their White counterparts was 30% lower for Black beneficiaries (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.68–0.72), 13% lower for Hispanic beneficiaries (OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.83–0.92), and 8% lower for Other beneficiaries (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.88–0.97). The odds of inclusion in Star Ratings measure assessment were not significantly different between Asian and White patients (OR=0.98, 95% CI=0.92–1.05) according to the demand-based analysis. The findings from the need-based model were generally similar, except that Asian patients also exhibited a lower likelihood of inclusion in measurement assessment when compared to White patients (OR=0.93, 95% CI=0.88–0.99).

A significant association was also observed between several other patient characteristics and the likelihood of being included in the Star Ratings measure assessment (Table 3). Based on the demand-based results, factors that were associated with lower odds of inclusion in Star Ratings measure assessment include older age (OR=0.981, 95% CI=0.980–0.982), male status (OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.91–0.94), a greater proportion of individuals with a minimum of a high school education (OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.50–0.80), a larger proportion of the uninsured population (OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.29–0.48), enrolling in Medicaid (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.87–0.91), residing in a metropolitan statistical area (OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.93–0.97), and a greater risk adjustment summary score (OR=0.792, 95% CI=0.790–0.795). Similarly, beneficiaries located in the Midwest (OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.87–0.93), South (OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.84–0.90), and West census regions (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.82–0.89) exhibited lower odds of being included in Star Ratings measure assessment compared to those in the Northeast. Conversely, factors that were associated with greater odds of inclusion in Star Ratings measure assessment include a larger proportion of married-couple families (OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.09–1.54) and a higher per-capita income (OR=1.003, 95% CI=1.002–1.004).

Table 4 reports the multivariable regression results for comparing the likelihood of inclusion in measure assessment between Star Ratings and Star Plus. Star Plus was found to be associated with a significant reduction in disparities when compared to Star Ratings. The findings in both demand- or need-based models indicate that disparities in measure assessment were lowered in Star Plus. Based on the demand-based model, disparities between White beneficiaries and Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other beneficiaries were reduced by 97% (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.89–2.05), 72% (OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.58–1.87), 115% (OR=2.15, 95% CI=1.87–2.46), and 44% (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.28–1.62), respectively. The need-based model produced similar findings.

4. Discussion

This study contributes to the literature by evaluating whether racial/ethnic disparities were associated with the inclusion criteria of the medication utilization measures in Star Ratings among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD. In addition, this study presents a first examination of how potential disparities in inclusion can be reduced by utilizing a proposed alternative program with broader inclusion criteria. Similar to previous studies that focused on other Medicare populations [15–18], the current study found that racial/ethnic minority groups generally exhibited significantly lower odds of inclusion in the assessment of measures in Star Ratings than White beneficiaries. Furthermore, findings from the current study indicate that disparities can be lessened by Star Plus by adding to Star Ratings a performance measure with relaxed inclusion criteria. This finding is also similar to the previous literature addressing disparities in Star Ratings among the entire Medicare fee-for-service population [21].

The Part D Star Ratings measures assessed in the current study are intended to improve the quality of medication utilization for treating diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, three of the commonly observed chronic conditions among the Medicare population [32]. Previous studies have indicated that these chronic conditions may be more prevalent among racial/ethnic minority groups with ADRD than their White counterparts [33–35]. In addition, among individuals with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, racial/ethnic minority groups tend to experience poorer medication utilization [36,37] and higher preventable spending and total healthcare costs [38,39]. Thus, there should be sufficient motives for CMS to increase the efficiency of health resource utilization by incentivizing health plans to improve the quality of medication utilization among racial/ethnic minority groups with ADRD and comorbid diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. However, the current study indicates that the criteria for inclusion in the assessment of Star Ratings measures may worsen racial/ethnic disparities in access to health services. Health plans may provide services to patients meeting the Star Ratings inclusion criteria than those who do not. While the Star Ratings program may improve the overall quality of medication utilization and health outcomes, the inclusion criteria determining who may be included in the program raises a legitimate concern that vulnerable populations such as racial/ethnic minority groups with ADRD may have fewer opportunities to benefit from this health improvement initiative.

While the current study demonstrates that an alternative program, Star Plus, can lessen racial and ethnic disparities pertaining to the inclusion criteria of medication utilization measures in Star Ratings, there remained beneficiaries who were excluded from the measure assessment. To eliminate disparities, more comprehensive medication utilization measures with less restrictive selection criteria would need to be incorporated into the Star Ratings program. Further, quality improvement programs in Medicare may need to be designed to tackle the needs of the racial/ethnic minority population.

Expansion of the medication utilization measures may also need to be combined with the adjustment for beneficiary demographic characteristics so that health plans are evaluated after accounting for the underlying risk factors of their patients. In fact, the CMS already began to employ a Categorical Adjustment Index that adjusts for the percentage of beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid, receiving a low-income subsidy, and/or having disability status [40].

Aside from race and ethnicity, the current study found that several other patient characteristics were significantly associated with the likelihood of inclusion in the assessment of Star Ratings measures. Among beneficiary-level characteristics, age, male status, Medicaid coverage, and risk adjustment summary score were negatively associated with the likelihood of inclusion in Star Ratings measures. This may stem from older patients, males, patients with Medicaid coverage, and those in poorer health status tend to experience lower medication adherence [41,42], while the inclusion criteria for Star Ratings measures are partly based on medication utilization. Among county/community-level characteristics, measures suggesting a lower socioeconomic status were generally associated with lower measure inclusion except for the proportion of individuals with a high school or higher education. This pattern is consistent with previous literature that reported lower socioeconomic status as a barrier to access to health care, including medications [43,44]. The reason for the negative association between inclusion in measure assessment and the proportion of individuals with a high school or higher education may be the correlation between various county-level measures. Beneficiaries in the Midwest, South, and West had a lower likelihood of inclusion in Star Ratings measures than those in the Northeast region. This may be due to higher access to health care and medications in the Northeast region [43].

Racial/ethnic disparities in the inclusion of pay-for-performance programs have also been observed in countries outside the U.S. An example of this can be seen in the United Kingdom’s Quality and Outcomes Framework. This pay-for-performance program provides financial incentives to general practitioners based on meeting specific targets related to various aspects of patient care. It was found that Black and South Asian patients with diabetes were less likely to be included in the program reporting compared to their White counterparts [45]. One reason for this pattern may be that these patients tended to have worse control of their medical condition.

The findings in this study should be interpreted with caution due to the following limitations. First, because the analysis was mostly restricted to information derived from the Medicare claims data, some beneficiary-level socioeconomic characteristics that may influence study outcomes could not be assessed in this study. The use of county-level proxies may be insufficient to fully account for some of the important beneficiary-level confounders. However, more granular proxies were unavailable to the researchers at the time of this study. Second, because the study sample was limited to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, the findings may not be generalized to other Medicare and commercial populations. Third, the cross-sectional design prevents the depiction of how disparities change over time. Future studies should also account for the changes in the composition of Star Ratings measures over time. Fourth, because the use of administrative claims data can only identify diseases through diagnosis codes, the current study may have underestimated the number of beneficiaries with ADRD, particularly those in earlier stages of ADRD who did not require extensive medical care or others who were unable to access medical services. This could have led to an underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority groups in the study population, as previous literature has noted the delay in diagnosis among these groups relative to White beneficiaries [46]. Further, this study did not control for ADRD duration, which may be associated with medication utilization, and in turn, inclusion in Star Ratings assessment. Fifth, the study sample may have selection bias due to the study’s observational nature.

5. Conclusion

The current study found that racial/ethnic disparities pertaining to inclusion in the assessment of measures in Star Ratings exist among the Medicare population with ADRD. Furthermore, this study also illustrated that the disparities above in Star Ratings might be lessened by incorporating more medication utilization measures with less restrictive selection criteria. To help improve the selection of medication utilization measures in Star Ratings for beneficiaries with ADRD, future studies should investigate the optimal composition of measures that can better align the interests of patients, providers, and health plans.
