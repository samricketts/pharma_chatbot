CONSPECTUS:

The predictable and controllable interaction of small organic or peptidic molecules with biological substrates is the primary reason most pharmaceuticals are narrowly decorated carbon frameworks. The inhibition or activation binding models are measurable and without side reactions that can cause pathological angst. Yet many diseases, especially those involving rapid proliferation of cells (i.e., cancer) or aggregation of peptides (e.g., heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease) have not yet been cured by inhibition therapeutics. Additionally, interventional medicine is often required to alleviate such maladies by physical removal first, followed by molecular-level therapy as a second stage. Thus, there appears to be a niche for more aggressive therapeutics that may employ harsher chemical processes to realize clinical efficacy, albeit without causing catastrophic side effects. Molecules that may be considered for this challenge are not typically biomimetic, nor do they fit the traditional pharmaceutical paradigm. They may have unusual modes of action or undesired reactivity that can be lethal if not controlled. These are the outliers; potential pharmacophores that biology does not know how to manage or adapt to. This is why they may be an intriguing class of agents that needs continuous development.

In this Account, we connect the under-developed enediyne family of compounds and our metalloenediyne derivatives to existing radical-based therapeutics such as bleomycin and doxorubicin to illustrate that controlled diradical reactivity, although an outlier mechanism, has a place in the therapeutic portfolio. This is self-evident in that of the 11 natural product enediynes known, 2 have clinical impact, a strong ratio. We expand on the chemical diversity of potential enediyne constructs and focus on the accessible trigger mechanisms to activate diradical formation as a method to control toxicity. Moreover, we further illustrate how electromagnetic fields can be employed to activate both molecular and larger nanomaterial constructs that carry highly concentrated payloads of reactive reagent. Finally, we describe how controlled diradical reactivity can reach beyond traditional therapeutic targets such as DNA, to peptide aggregates found in blood clots, neural fibrils, and membrane scaffolds. It is our belief that cleverly constructed frameworks with well-designed and controlled activation/reaction schemes can lead to novel therapeutics that can challenge evolving viral and bacterial invaders. From this evangelical perspective, our hope is that the conceptual framework, if not the specific designs in this Account, stimulate the readership to develop out-of-the-box therapeutic designs that may combat resistant disease targets.

Graphical Abstract


pmcINTRODUCTION

The vast majority of pharmaceuticals are constructed using the building blocks of life: C, H, N, O, S, and P. Most function via lock and key binding models that are devoid of undesirable chemical reactivity, lending them excellent physiological stability. In contrast, the outliers of this group are frameworks based on diverse elements spanning the periodic table including Li, Sr, Mn, Tc, Gd, Fe, Ru, Cu, Zn, Ga, Pt, and Au. Some pharmaceutically relevant metals function by processes such as radiation sensitization, high-field NMR detection (i.e., MRI contrast imaging), or in vivo gamma-ray emission (i.e., PET imaging) that may appear startling relative to seemingly innocuous Pt complexes (e.g., cisplatin) that typically bind to nuclear DNA after chemical ligand exchange.1 However, altering delicate genetic events at the molecular level can have its own destructive cellular and physiological outcomes. With such potentially catastrophic consequences, why have these reactive outliers made their way into mainstream medicine? Simply because they deliver potent, disease-specific responses through clever, painstaking tuning to control the ratio of desired-to-undesired outcomes, independent of biological mimicry.

Radical generation is a potentially toxic reaction pathway that can cause biological miscues. However, H atom abstraction by energetic radicals also has the potential to serve as a powerful therapeutic approach toward a variety of disease states that can be mitigated by the degradation of unwanted biological substrates. Two well-established therapeutic examples involving in situ small molecule H atom abstraction pathways are doxorubicin (DOX) and bleomycin (BLM). Doxorubicin is an organic molecule that intercalates into the minor groove of DNA, inhibiting the progression of topoisomerase II and, ultimately, replication.2 A second mode of cytotoxicity also exists deriving from the DOX reaction with Cu(II) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in DNA strand scission (Figure 1A).3 Analogously, BLM4 is administered as an organic apo-drug that chelates Fe(II) in vivo to form a preactive complex that binds to DNA via intercalation of the bithiazole tail.5 This species is activated upon O2 binding, leading to formation of a low-spin ferric hydroperoxide complex, BLM-Fe(III)-OOH. The activated BLM performs DNA cleavage through C-4′ H atom abstraction and degradation of the activated complex to form a high-valent iron-oxo species (Figure 1B).5-8

While common to Fe and Cu under biological conditions, formation of redox activated intermediates for H atom abstraction is not exclusive to these reactive metals. In fact, soil bacteria have given us 11 unique 9- and 10-membered enediyne natural products carrying the unstable 1,5-diyne-3-ene unit.9 Three of the most common, calicheamicin,10 esperamicin,11 and dynemicin A1,12 follow a general mechanism of action involving binding in the minor groove of DNA and activation of the enediyne core via a bioreduction-induced geometric rearrangement13,14 to relieve strain in the native structure.15 The resulting 1,4-diradical intermediate is a potent species that performs H atom abstraction from the sugar backbone of DNA (Figure 1C).16 While the natural product enediynes demonstrate incredibly low IC50 values (calicheamicin, 1.0 × 10−6 μM; dynemicin, 4.0 × 10−5 μM), the inability to harness the onset of diradical formation limits their use as direct small molecule drugs due to their high cytotoxicity. However, employment of polymer-based delivery vehicles and antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) have successfully managed diradical cytotoxicity.9

Despite their compositional differences, the common thread among the DNA-damaging mechanisms of BLM-Fe(II), DOX-Cu(II), and the natural product enediyne dynemicin is that each requires a critical redox activation event and, in the case of dynemicin, a subsequent structural rearrangement to realize the key intermediate capable of DNA degradation. The challenge of orchestrating such steps properly is critical to the success of these types of agents. If the potency of the H atom abstracting intermediate could be reliably controlled by dictating the onset of activation, it would pave the way for the development of an array of versatile and aggressive warheadcarrying frameworks capable of combatting significant disease challenges.

CARBON AND BEYOND

While the cycloaromatization mechanism of enediyne constructs was first described in detail by Bergman in 1972,17 it was not until the discovery of the natural products and their potent anticancer properties that the mechanism of radical generation gained widespread interest. Work by Nicolaou and others using simple carbon-based enediynes led to the development of the proximity rule stating that the terminal–yne carbons must be able to interact to generate the cyclized diradical intermediate. A critical inter-alkynyl distance (d) of ~2.9–3.4 Å was established for spontaneous Bergman cyclization (BC) using thermal activation under physiological conditions.18,19 A second proposition put forward by Snyder tied the cyclization barrier to the difference in strain energy between the ground and transition states, where strain relief is achieved by the σ-bond forming and π-bond breaking step prior to the key diradical intermediate.20 The critical distance paradigm holds for the simplest acyclic and monocyclic enediyne systems, while the difference in strain energy provides a better kinetic measure for more complicated structure types.21,22

Inspired by the cyclic enediyne units of the natural products, early synthetic approaches to model enediyne frameworks focused on carbon macrocycles (Figure 2A). Since acyclic enediynes are known to have high BC barriers,15 size- and sterically tunable carbon macrocycles provided a measure of control over the inter-alkynyl distance and degree of strain at the alkyne termini through unfavorable bond angles. Although the intermediate is stabilized via the formation of a new σ-bond by the in-phase π-orbitals (not shown), the destabilization of the corresponding out-of-phase π-orbital dominates the energy of intermediate formation, as it rearranges to house the forming diradical (Figure 2B).22-24 Thus, there is a strong geometric dependence of the ground state energy on inter-alkynyl distance. Reducing this distance increases destructive interference in this orbital, raising the energy of the ground state and consequently reducing the activation barrier. While reactive, these carbon-based structures have limited geometric shape options for tuning the cyclization barrier, as the carbon atoms immediately adjacent to the alkyne termini are typically sp3 hybridized with C─C bond lengths showing only small variability. It is therefore no wonder that nature went to such elaborate, redox-triggered conformational rearrangement schemes to tightly control the enediyne cyclization event within the carbon-rich natural products.

A landmark study by Buchwald et al. demonstrated that the same inter-alkynyl proximity–reactivity relationship observed for the organic enediynes holds when an enediyne unit forms a metallacycle by chelation. When the bidentate enediyne ligand 1,2-bis((diphenylphosphanyl)ethynyl)benzene (dppeb) is coordinated to Hg(II) (d = 3.4 Å), no solution reactivity is observed upward of 300 °C. However, when coordinated to Pd(II) or Pt(II) (d ≈ 3.3 Å), solution cyclization occurs spontaneously under ambient conditions (Figure 3A).25 The notable discontinuities in the geometric and electronic structures of these divalent complexes (i.e., d8 square planar vs d10 tetrahedral) led to the hypothesis that, all other parameters being nearly equal, the larger bond angles for the tetrahedron may be the root cause of the significant difference in cyclization behavior (Figure 2B). Indeed, it is now established from a suite of crystallographically characterized complexes of the dppeb ligand (Pt(0), Pd(0), Ag(I), and Cu(I)) that the tetrahedral geometry provides robust thermal stability regardless of metal identity (Figure 2B).26-28 This remarkable difference in reactivity between the planar d8 structures and their d10 tetrahedral counterparts demonstrates the significant impact judicious choice of metal ions with specific geometric preferences can have for enhancing enediyne cyclization and stabilizing the enediyne warhead to spontaneous reaction.

REDOX MEDIATED GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE VARIATIONS

The geometric and electronic structure–activity correlation (SAC) for metal-enediyne motifs (Figure 3A) opened the door to a range of potential synthetic constructs with redox-based activation approaches. The ability to translate the SAC across different ligand sets with preferences for specific metal ions having two stable geometries as a function of oxidation state (e.g., Cu(II) d9 tetragonal vs Cu(I) d10 tetrahedral) (Figure 3B) further illuminates the close relationship between electronically driven geometric preference and the barrier to cyclization.29 Although these static structures are not interconvertible, they suggest that an in situ redox-initiated geometry change could be an approach to controlling the radical-generation event, not unlike that employed by the natural products. In 2015, Lindahl et al. successfully demonstrated this approach via in situ BC of the robust, zerovalent Pt(dppeb)2 complex upon oxidation to Pt(II) via I2.26 The reaction trajectory reveals a metastable [Pt-(dppeb)2]2+ complex, the first of its kind, suggesting that these highly strained square-planar Pt(II) complexes may be more thermally accessible than previously believed. Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that steric hindrance of the phenyl rings prevents the metal center from adopting the square planar geometry that would spontaneously trigger the cyclization event. Anion-assisted displacement of one ligand within a few hours rapidly leads to formation of the square planar Pt(dppeb)I2 species, which quickly cyclizes in solution (Figure 3C).26 The cyclized product is itself an analogue of cisplatin, making this an intriguing paradigm for generating dual-threat therapies that combine DNA binding with concomitant diradical generation.

GEOMETRY MODULATED STERIC AND ELECTRONIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO CYCLIZATION

The direct geometric influence on BC is a clear correlation that reliably tracks across metal and ligand structure variations. In these cases, the reaction coordinate and activation barrier are clearly dominated by the alkyne termini separation/ring strain contributions. However, chemical dynamics and reaction coordinate dimensions are rarely so orthogonal in complex molecules, and thus more subtle electronic or steric contributions to reactivity can be masked by the dominant component of the trajectory. To probe these elusive effects on the activation barrier to BC, a series of ethylenediaminestrapped MLX2 (L = 1,4-dibenzyl/diethyl-1,4-diaza-cyclododec-8-ene-6,10-diyne; X = halogen; M = Zn(II), Cu(II), Pd(II)) enediynes were prepared in an attempt to remove the geometric alkyne termini separation contributions from the activation barrier.30 Unlike many reactive enediyne complexes, this suite is crystallographically characterized, removing any structural ambiguity. The Zn(II) compounds are tetrahedral, while the Cu(II) and Pd(II) enediynes are distorted square-planar and square planar, respectively. Interestingly, while the Cu(II) and Pd(II) compounds exhibit similar inter-alkynyl distances (3.75–3.88 Å) and ligand conformations, the Cu(II) complexes exhibit BC at 140–150 °C, while the Pd(II) analogues all cyclize at significantly elevated temperatures (205–220 °C). Both series also demonstrate activation barriers that are relatively independent of X. In contrast, the geometrically homologous Zn(II) structures demonstrate a marked dependence on X, ranging from 144 °C (X = I) to 207 °C (X = Cl). Crystallography supported DFT computations indicate that the barrier to cyclization within this series is dictated by a pronounced electronic interaction with the halogen lone pair, which points directly into the developing C─C bond, thus raising the energy of the transition state.31 While these interactions occur through space for the tetrahedral Zn(II) series and through bonds for the square planar Pd(II) compounds, the distorted square-planar geometry of Cu(II) inhibits both the through space and through bond communication, and thus, little halogen-dependence on the cyclization parameters is observed.30 These examples clearly demonstrate the close interconnectivity that exists between geometry and electronics in defining the activation barrier contributions.

METAL–LIGAND COVALENCY ACTIVATES BERGMAN CYCLIZATION

Combining the intimate relationship between oxidation state, geometry, and electronic contributions to BC of bidentate enediyne complexes with a desire for aqueous media solubility, a suite of Cu(II), Fe(II), and Zn(II) complexes containing tetradentate (Z)-N,N-bis[1-pyridin-2-yl-meth(E)-ylidene]oct-4-ene-2,6-diyne-1,8-diamine, PyED, and cyclized control PyBD were synthesized in order to create a ligand scaffold that would resist hydrolysis and provide a more intricate modulation of the SAC.32 The all N-backbone is neutral, leading to potentially charged complexes with Mn+ having high aqueous solubility. Additionally, the sterically unencumbered and planar imine functionality near the alkyne termini imparts rigidity and steric strain in the structure once the metallacycle is formed. Yet, the methylene bridge builds in flexibility around the metal center, where one of the pyridine rings can rotate out of the plane to assume an axial binding mode, allowing halogen to occupy the in-plane site as evidenced by a pπ Cl → Cu(II) LMCT in the electronic absorption spectrum. Although each metal complex adopts a solvated, distorted octahedral structure in solution and begins to cyclize at 37 °C within 3 h, the M–L bond lengths vary markedly due to metal–ligand covalency (Figure 4A).32 Closer examination illustrates that the DFT computed metal–imine bond lengths mirror the cyclization reactivity in the order Cu(II) &gt; Fe(II) &gt; Zn(II) over the 3 h window due to the reduced inter-alkynyl separation. This same trend is observed for a series of structurally analogous quinoline-containing metalloenediyne complexes of Cu(II), Fe(II), Zn(II), and Mg(II). The tighter bonds for Cu(II) and Fe(II) lead to lower activation energies for these complexes compared to Mg(II) and Zn(II) analogues,33 but in general, all QuiED cyclization reactions experience retardation in radical generation compared to their PyED counterparts32-34 due to steric hindrance between the quinoline functionalities. The impact that metal–ligand bond covalency plays in the speed and extent of these cyclization reactions cannot be overstated and provides some key guiding principles for designing effective BC transformations in aqueous media.

ATTACKING DNA SUBSTRATES

The noted ability of the natural product enediynes to induce interstrand cross-links or DNA double-strand breaks suggests that DNA is a ripe choice for diradical-generation schemes. Indeed this is true as in situ PyED activation by Cu(II), Fe(II), and Zn(II) also induces degradation of DNA within 1 h at 42.5 °C for all metal centers (Figure 4A). The rate and extent of DNA degradation correlates with the metal-dependent Bergman reactivity of the complexes, with Cu(II) activation producing 50% compromised DNA within 5 min and 80% overall DNA reacted over 1 h.32 The Cu(II)-PyED–DNA reactivity is comparable to that of the BLM analogue phleomycin in an analogous 1 h trial, highlighting the potency of the diradical for DNA damage.32

While DNA degradation is an important demonstration of therapeutic potential, the ability of the cell to reverse the damage through DNA repair machinery mandates that degradation events be rapid and irreversible in order to halt cell proliferation. As a measure of efficacy, the Cu(II)-PyED DNA degradation reaction was run simultaneously with DNA polymerase I template strand extension and shown to outcompete primer extension by damaging the template strand before it could be lengthened (Figure 4B).32 The speed of this reaction suggests that DNA could be targeted during the brief period that it is not protected by chromatin, usually during DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Additionally, that the compromised template strand could not be extended may mean that the diradical-induced damage is irreversible. On a cellular level, treatment of HeLa cells with Cu(II)-PyED results in considerable cellular toxicity within 1 h using doses as low as 10 μM (Figure 5A) and significant G2/M arrest due to the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint response (Figure 5B).32

BROADENING BIOPOLYMER SUBSTRATE SCOPE

While peptides and proteins have statistically fewer backbone α-C─H bonds for attack than deoxyribose, misfolded or overexpressed peptides, as well as unwanted peptide aggregates such as Aβ fibrils associated with Alzheimer’s disease, could all be considered intriguing targets for diradical dissolution strategies. In this latter example, Aβ fibril formation can be catalyzed by free Zn(II) or Cu(II) ions, which can be removed by 8-hydroxyquinoline chelates such as clioquinol and PBT2 as a means to fibril dissolution.35-37 Additionally, rational design of other polydentate ligands with nitrogen/oxygen donors have demonstrated decreased metal–Aβ toxicity in vitro.38,39 Tetradentate enediyne ligands offer an attractive, 2-fold approach to this problem via the ability to chelate the scaffold-connecting metal center and use the chelation event to trigger diradical generation for further fibril breakdown. An analysis of Lipinski’s rule parameters and blood–brain barrier penetration via the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay for the blood–brain barrier (PAMPA-BBB) suggests that small molecules such as the enediyne-containing PyED ligand may possess drug-like characteristics for therapeutic application.40 Binding studies indicate an approximate Kd for Cu(II)–PyBD that is nanomolar, comparable to that of Aβ for the binding of Cu(II) in vivo.40,41 The ability of PyED to modulate metal-induced Aβ aggregation pathways was demonstrated using Western blot analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Figure 6). PyED shows significant disaggregation of the Cu(II)- and Zn(II)-containing fibrils within 2 and 8 h at 37 °C, respectively, and markedly accelerated fibril dissolution under hyperthermic conditions (43 °C).40 The enhanced disaggregation and inhibition observed with PyED relative to the metal-free and nonradical generating controls means that both chelation and radical-generation play key roles in the fibril degradation mechanism,40 underscoring the potential of such bifunctional, radical-based approaches to initiate peptide degradation pathways.

PHOTOELECTRONIC AND PHOTOTHERMAL ENEDIYNE ACTIVATION AT EXPANDED CORES

The hyperthermal sensitivity of enediynes combined with their extended π-electronic structures makes them excellent candidates for light activation. It is well established that direct electronic excitation into the enediyne π-system, generally in the ultraviolet region, promotes Bergman cyclization by traditional excited state distortion.42 Synthesis of metalloenediynes with rich electronic structures (e.g., extended π-systems, charge transfer capable, or redox/geometry sensitive oxidation states) also permit direct electronic activation by excitation of the chromophore–enediyne unit.43 In the simplest cases, porphyrinic enediynes with conjugated enediyne π-systems at the pyrroles can be irradiated into the Soret (B) or Q bands well out into the visible spectral region to initiate electronic cycloaromatization of the periphery, forming piceno- and Pt-assisted phenanthro-porphyrin structures (Figure 7A).44-46 These molecules mimic an O2-independent photodynamic therapy strategy where the porphyrin radicals could be envisioned to attack biological substrates if the internal radical-trapping phenyl rings were removed. Less synthetically intensive is the use of small metalloenediynes with predisposed metal–ligand charge transfer excited states to either trigger geometric rearrangement by metal redox chemistry or activate the enediyne via nonradiative decay. An example of this latter strategy is the high valent vanadium(V)-catecholED complex, which exhibits strong LMCT transitions centered at 584 and 1028 nm. Photoexcitation of this compound in the near-infrared region (λ = 785 or 1064 nm) photothermally generates cyclized, polymerized product analogous to that formed through the thermal reaction at elevated temperatures.47 The utility of moving excitation energies to tissue transparent wavelengths, combined with the synthetic ease of less complex organic structures make photothermal strategies of this type an attractive option for biologically relevant metalloenediyne designs.

Though examples in the literature are few, gold nanoparticles can alter the behavior of enediynes in unexpected ways. In the case of an enediynyl pentapeptide synthesized by Basak et al., the fluorescence quantum yield of the molecule is enhanced in the presence of gold nanoparticles in polar organic solvent due to the interaction between the gold surface and nitrogen lone pair, which otherwise donates into the photoexcited π-system.48 In another example, room temperature solution stability can be greatly enhanced for asymmetric carbon-framework enediynes by incubating them with gold nanoparticles.49,50 In contrast, Mondal et al. showed that DNA cleavage reactivity of simple dithiol enediynes under UV excitation or thermal incubation was increased by upward of 50% using gold nanoparticles, possibly due to a surface concentration effect.51

These results point to some of the great advantages presented by using nanomaterials in reactive or therapeutic applications.52 Nanomaterials in general possess unique physical properties, and one exciting avenue in nanomedicine research is harnessing this behavior for dynamic purposes. Already established in medical imaging fields, the optical and magnetic signatures of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles, respectively, can also be excited to generate heat for therapeutic benefit in so-called photothermal therapy and magnetic hyperthermia treatments.53 In principle, the ability to thermally activate surface functionality such as radical generators on a nanoscale platform could be the basis for an effective theranostic agent.

Gold nanoparticles under resonant irradiation efficiently convert incoming photons into heat, resulting in marked temperature rise within a few nanometers of their surface, sufficient to promote chemical reactions such as BC.54 For example, a small, symmetric 1,8-dithiolenediyne easily coordinates to a metallic gold surface (Figure 7B), and the resulting solution is moderately stable in ethanol at room temperature, as ascertained by monitoring its surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorbance feature (λ = 529 nm). By excitation of the solution using continuous wave laser irradiation resonant with the SPR band (λ = 514 nm), the bulk solution temperature rises minimally. However, high densities of radical species are produced as intermediates to form conjugated aromatic and polymeric products, as evidenced by fluorescence and new vibrations in the Raman spectra as well as the emergence of dense polymer coatings around the gold cores visible by TEM. Aggregating the initial enediyne-coated gold particles results in a solid material with absorbance farther into the red. The photoreactivity of this material is straightforwardly monitored using low-temperature Raman vibrational spectroscopy wherein the excitation wave-length (λ = 785 nm) is chosen to interact with the SPR of the aggregate. Over the course of 4 h, distinct vibrations from new polyaromatic species are observed, indicating low-energy photoelectronic diradical generation, albeit in nonaqueous media.

A common strategy in nanomedicine and small molecule drug development is PEGylation, in which even relatively short poly(ethylene glycol) chains confer water solubility to organic molecules and inorganic nanostructures. A gold nanoparticle–PEG7500–EDDA (EDDA = (Z)-octa-4-en-2,6-diyne-1,8-diamine) conjugated material (Figure 7B) displays excellent water solubility and is stable at room temperature for extended time.55 Laser irradiation (Ar+, λ = 514 nm) induces BC of the pendant enediyne, which is cleanly monitored with Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, fluorescence quenching experiments prove that the 1,4-benzyl diradical intermediate is available for bimolecular reactions, as the emission of Alexa-Fluor 488 is reduced by over 90% in 2 h of photolysis in the presence of Au–PEG–EDDA.

Using gold nanoparticles to photothermally turn over the enediyne reaction allows for unique spatiotemporal control of the radical generation event. Added to this, the high payload of reactive molecule present in nanoparticle–enediyne solutions opens the door to applications involving large biomolecules and assemblages of proteins. Au–PEG–EDDA has successfully been applied against in vitro clot mimics composed of fibrin and polymerized fibrinogen (350 kDa), strands of which can be hundreds of nanometers in diameter and micrometers long in forming the structural architecture of blood clots.55 The robust protein is stable to nanoparticle heating alone, as shown through control experiments with a nonreactive analogue particle, but exhibits structural modifications after photolysis with the thermally activated radical generator, seen in scanning electron microscopy of fixed samples (Figure 8, top). Moreover, by layering the nanoparticle solution on top of the gel-like clot phantom, penetration of the extrinsic solution into the bulk of the clot is only observed under photolysis conditions with Au–PEG–EDDA. The structural modifications induced by the radical plus heat system alter material transport properties on a macroscale.

The conceptual framework of using remote activation of inorganic nanoparticles as a means to trigger coordinated organic molecules is transferable to other nanoparticle architectures. Iron oxide motifs in particular, being magnetically active, are used to increase MRI contrast and for hyperthermia treatments in the presence of an alternating magnetic field.56 Through analogous coupling chemistry to the Au–PEG–EDDA construct, Fe3O4–PEG–EDDA can be readily prepared providing a magnetically vs optically active core for external field excitation.57 A choice in PEG linker lengths allows for some degree of fine-tuning of the solution properties and packing density of the pendant enediyne. When solutions of Fe3O4–PEG–EDDA are incubated within an alternating magnetic field, those with a shorter PEG (2 kDa) exhibit faster reactivity and greater degree of polymer formation than those with a longer linker (5 kDa) due to the distance from the iron oxide surface and packing density of reactive molecules. When activated in the presence of a proteinaceous target (Matrigel) mimicking the extracellular membrane environment involved in metathesis, magneto-thermal radical generation by Fe3O4–PEG–EDDA results in structural damage and ultimate failure after sustained magnetic activation (Figure 8, bottom). Similar to the Au–PEG–EDDA interaction with fibrin, the combined effect of heating (below native protein denaturation levels, as confirmed using nonreactive control molecules) plus radical generation from the enediyne moiety in a single nanoconjugate material destabilizes the protein network structure, ultimately allowing for material transport or altered mechanical properties of the biopolymer. The payload capacity and external field activation advantages of these nanoarchitectures makes them a high potential prospect for boutique nanomedicine strategies looking forward.

OUTLOOK

The high activity of the enediyne natural product in ratio to their relatively small isolated number suggests that proper delivery or activation of the enediyne unit are the critical obstacles to be overcome to realize the potential of this unique chemical functionality. While the ADC strategy is starting to show efficacy, it still relies on natural product conjugation methods. which have traditionally evolved slowly. The recurring themes of bifunctional reactivity and external field activation in this Account suggest that interventional approaches to enediyne application may be the key to finding utility for this class of compounds. Molecular and nanomaterial engineering, combined with the broader potential for biological substrate diversity may also identify a critical in vivo, or possibly ex vivo, niche for enediyne constructs not fully appreciated by research using these chemical motifs to date. One point is clear: these structure types and their potent but potentially highly toxic reactivity have been outliers in the pharmaceutical field since being cast off from the mainstream two decades ago. However, clever design strategies, activation methods, and, frankly, brute force may be bringing them back into view as a member of a new generation of engineered medicines.
