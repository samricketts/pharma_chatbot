The world faces a pandemic-level prevalence of type 2 diabetes. In parallel with this massive burden of metabolic disease is the growing prevalence of dementia as the population ages. The two health issues are intertwined. The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care was convened to tackle the growing global concern of dementia by identifying risk factors. It concluded, along with other studies, that diabetes as well as obesity and the metabolic syndrome more broadly, which are frequently comorbid, raise the risk of developing dementia. Type 2 diabetes is a modifiable risk factor; however, it is uncertain whether anti-diabetic drugs mitigate risk of developing dementia. Reasons are manifold but constitute a critical knowledge gap in the field. This review outlines studies of type 2 diabetes on risk of dementia, illustrating key concepts. Moreover, it identifies knowledge gaps, reviews strategies to help fill these gaps, and concludes with a series of recommendations to mitigate risk and advance understanding of type 2 diabetes and dementia.

pmc1. Problem Statement

The world faces a pandemic-level prevalence of type 2 diabetes. The 2021 global estimate is over 536 million affected people or about 10.5% of the adult population,1 up by a staggering 73 million in only two years from the 2019 estimate of 463 million (Figure 1).2 If trends persist, the world faces the prospect of 783.2 million affected people by 2045 or about 12.2% of the population.2 Estimated global total diabetes-related health expenditures were almost one trillion US dollars in 2021. In parallel with this massive burden of metabolic disease is the growing prevalence of dementia as the population ages. In 2019, 57.4 million people worldwide were living with dementia, which is projected to rise to 152.8 million cases by 2050.3 Like diabetes, dementia poses a substantial socioeconomic burden, incurring around one trillion US dollars annually worldwide.4 The situation is rendered graver still since dementia currently lacks effective disease-modifying treatments.5

The two health issues are intertwined. The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care was convened in 20176 and again in 20207 to tackle the growing global concern of dementia by identifying risk factors. The Lancet Commission6, 7 and other studies increasingly suggest that diabetes8–10 as well as obesity11 and the metabolic syndrome12 more broadly, which are frequently comorbid, raise the risk of developing dementia. There could therefore be grave consequences for the burden of dementia if the prevalence of diabetes1 and obesity13 increase further. Herein, we outline the studies of type 2 diabetes on risk of dementia; the review is not comprehensive, but rather serves to illustrate key concepts. Moreover, we identify knowledge gaps, review strategies that might help fill these gaps, and conclude with a series of recommendations to advance the field.

2. Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, i.e., an impaired ability of the body to respond to insulin and metabolize glucose, leading to hyperglycemia, defined as a fasting glucose level greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL (Figure 1). Additionally, patients with a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) higher than 6.5% also meet the criteria of diabetes. In some instances, type 2 diabetes is preceded by prediabetes, an insulin resistant state with an elevated HbA1c of 5.7–6.4%, which is above normal values but below the level defining type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is frequently co-morbid with obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Obesity can be characterized by generalized metrics, such as body mass index (BMI), or by parameters of central obesity, such as waist circumference. The metabolic syndrome encompasses a collection of metabolic dysfunctions, which broadly include insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The clinical criteria defining individuals with the metabolic syndrome require at least 3 out of 5 clinical findings that include elevated waist circumference, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and fasting glucose and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Figure 1).14

3. Dementia definitions

Dementia is an umbrella term, which encompasses several distinct clinical entities. It is characterized by a diminished ability to lead a normal life on a daily basis due to cognitive impairment from poor memory, executive function, and judgement, along with a decline in behavioral and social skills. Cognitive impairment progresses with time along a continuum, starting from mild cognitive impairment leading to frank dementia (Figure 1). The most common dementia is Alzheimer’s disease and the closely associated Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRDs), which are defined by the presence of extracellular amyloid-β plaques and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau tangles in the brain.5 Vascular dementia occurs in 20 to 30% of cases, with Lewy body and frontotemporal dementias accounting for 10–25% and 10–15% of cases, respectively. These dementias differ from Alzheimer’s disease in neuropathology and the affected brain areas. For the purposes of this review, we will use the term “cognitive impairment” to refer to the clinical manifestation of dementia and will employ the general term “dementia” to refer to the link with diabetes.

4. Type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome increase dementia risk

Patients with type 2 diabetes frequently develop neurological complications. Peripheral neuropathy and cardiac autonomic neuropathy are long known neurologic complications.15 However, increasingly, evidence indicates that type 2 diabetes may also cause injury to the brain, possibly through similar pathological processes as occurring in peripheral nerves, which would manifest as cognitive impairment and, eventually, dementia. Indeed, clinical studies underscore a correlation between presence of peripheral neuropathy with the development of cognitive impairement.16, 17

There are also important and shared pathological features between type 2 diabetes and dementia, which are both characterized by metabolic perturbations in the brain, e.g., insulin resistance,18 altered glucose uptake and utilization.19 These similarities in pathology are reflected in clinical studies that demonstrate an increased risk of dementia in individuals with type 2 diabetes and dementia.9, 10, 20 Moreover, the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care now recognizes diabetes as a well-established risk factor for dementia.6, 7 The onset of dementia in diabetes patients is gradual. It starts with subtle cognitive impairment, which, in progressive patients, develops into mild cognitive impairment followed by frank dementia, oftentimes as Alzheimer’s disease.21 This progressive cognitive impairment occurs in parallel with structural brain changes, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).21 In addition to diabetes, obesity and hypertension, also components of the metabolic syndrome, are well-established risk factors for dementia based on the Lancet Commission6, 7 and independent studies.22–24

To estimate the contribution to dementia burden from diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, the Lancet Commission estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF), which represents the percentage of new cases that could be avoided if a specific risk factor was removed.6, 7 Their analysis leveraged risks from institutional guidelines, primary studies, and meta-analyses to calculate PAF for various risks on all-cause dementia. PAF for diabetes in later life was calculated as 1.1%, 0.7% for midlife obesity, and 1.9% for hypertension. Additionally, physical inactivity, which is an aspect of poor metabolism and the modern sedentary lifestyle, has a PAF of 1.6% for all-cause dementia.

In addition to the findings from the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care, we present evidence for the link between type 2 diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome to dementia from a series of illustrative studies. Cross-sectional evaluation of PREDIMED-PLUS, a study of 6,823 older participants averaging 65 years of age, identified that an HbA1c cutoff of 7% (i.e., 53 mmol/mol) impacted executive function in overweight or obese type 2 diabetes participants, after adjusting for education and additional clinical parameters.20 Longitudinal assessment of The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, a study of 5,099 older participants, over a median of 5 years found several risk factors for developing mild cognitive impairment, spanning presence of diabetes, diabetes duration, and poor diabetes control, following adjustments for education, among other parameters.9 Longitudinal analysis of the Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study over 23 years of follow-up reported that diabetes raised the risk of incident dementia based on 1,244 participants, after adjusting for education and more variables.10

Other components of the metabolic syndrome, which are frequently comorbid with type 2 diabetes, similarly increase the chance of dementia. Cross-sectional analysis of our own Michigan cohort (n=184) found that obesity, independent even of diabetes, compromised performance on the NIH Toolbox, following adjustments, in addition to educational attainment.22 Meta-analysis of 21 longitudinal studies at least 2 years long reported obesity increased risk of developing dementia in participants below 65 years old but decreased the risk in participants older than 65 years.23 Dyslipidemia emerged as a risk factor for cognitive decline at a 20-year follow-up in the ARIC study (n=13,997) when adjusting for education and several additional parameters.24

Overall, these findings indicate that diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome, i.e., obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, predispose individuals to dementia.

5. Major identified gaps limiting progress

Since diabetes and obesity are modifiable, they may constitute a potential avenue for lowering future incidence of dementia. Based on estimated PAFs, about 1.1% of dementia cases may be preventable if later life diabetes could be avoided.7 Preventing midlife obesity with a BMI above 30 kg/m2 could similarly stop about 0.7% of dementia cases.7 Although the percentages of preventable dementia from diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and inactivity are low, they comprise a significant number of individuals, since annual global incidence rates are high. Thus, controlling these modifiable risk factors may pave a way forward for managing the anticipated burden of dementia. This is especially critical since there is evidence to suggest that age-specific incidence of dementia may currently be on the decline, especially in higher income countries,7 possibly due to improved education, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and healthcare.6 However, we stand to lose the benefit from the current decreasing trend in dementia incidence if we cannot offset the rising prevalence of risk factors like type 2 diabetes1, 2 and obesity.25, 26

The Lancet Commission summarized the available studies that examined modifiable risk from diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and inactivity.7 Tentative evidence indicates that controlling hypertension with anti-hypertensive medications or exercise to battle inactivity may reduce dementia incidence; however, data regarding anti-diabetic medications and the long-term effects of weight loss are sparser and inconclusive.7 The reasons anti-diabetic medications may not effectively lower dementia incidence may be manifold; possibly, once the diabetes disease process has started, it may already be too late to mitigate dementia risk due to irreversible damage to the brain. Longitudinal, prospective studies are needed to investigate early changes that occur to the brain during prediabetes and diabetes, both to document early injury and identify biomarkers for individuals most at-risk of dementia. Moreover, it is necessary to evaluate whether early interventions to prevent diabetes, rather than treating it once the disease has started, may more effectively prevent dementia.

Alternatively, diabetes is frequently comorbid with other components of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, which may still incur a risk of dementia to diabetic patients, even if they are taking anti-diabetic medications. Thus, a multi-pronged approach targeting multiple elements of the metabolic syndrome, and not just diabetes, may be needed. Another possibility is that some diabetes patients may be genetically predisposed to dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Indeed, although primarily a metabolically-acquired disease, polygenic risk, i.e., arising from multiple single nucleotide variants (SNPs) at several sites, exists for type 2 diabetes,27 as well as, potentially, for peripheral diabetic neuropathy.27 Dementia and Alzheimer’s disease more specifically have well-established genetic risk.5, 28 Thus, it may be possible if type 2 diabetes and dementia share genetic risk, that some patients with type 2 diabetes may be genetically predisposed to dementia. If highly penetrant, this polygenic risk may not be non-modifiable if it is highly penetrant even by lifestyle changes. Alternatively, rather than being an inherent feature of diabetes biology, studies published to date on anti-diabetic drugs on dementia risk may not have been powered to detect an effect.29 Larger, well-designed studies of anti-diabetic drugs may help address this possibility. Finally, dementia still lacks disease-modifying therapies; thus, targeted, mechanism-based therapies are needed, and understanding the shared pathophysiology between diabetes and dementia, for example using Omics, could help develop treatments.

Thus, although diabetes is now definitively recognized as a dementia risk factor, along with other components of the metabolic syndrome, the path forward remains challenging since the ability to modify dementia risk remains uncertain.

6. Innovative methods to address the knowledge gaps

In this section, we review research methods that may be applied to address the knowledge gaps in diabetes leading to dementia. The focus is on clinical studies in consented participants or on human tissue, although a rich literature on research models also exists. We cover brain imaging to monitor early changes that occur during the progression of disease from prediabetes to diabetes. Additionally, Omics technologies generate large datasets of genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic information to uncover the biology underlying the risk of dementia from diabetes.

6.1 Brain imaging

Reliable brain imaging biomarkers could prove highly transformative as biomarkers relevant to diabetes-related dementia. Non-invasive imaging of at-risk individuals could detect early changes to the brain prior to clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment. This could help as a diagnostic tool of at-risk individuals with prediabetes or diabetes or permit initiation of interventions, either possible lifestyle interventions or as-yet unavailable disease-modifying therapies, within this critical window for neuroprotection. Furthermore, as our understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetes-linked dementia progresses, imaging biomarkers could enable preventative strategies. Finally, imaging could track changes over time, providing a longitudinal measure of efficacy for any attempted intervention.

6.1.1 Brain magnetic resonance imaging

The current imaging technology, based largely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is helpful for detecting brain changes. Difficulty, however, arises in determining whether these findings are a direct link between a comorbid condition like diabetes to dementia as opposed to noncontributory sequelae of a chronic condition. However, incorporating imaging techniques and biomarkers into modern clinical studies strengthens the causative link between diabetes and the progression to dementia. For example, prediabetes30, 31 and diabetes8 worsens signs of small vessel disease on MRI (white matter hyperintensities, lacunar and microinfarcts, microbleeds, or enlarged perivascular spaces) and alters brain volumes in regions subserving memory (e.g., hippocampus) (Table 1). In the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care-Kungsholmen, both prediabetes and diabetes correlated with elevated cognitive impairment over a mean follow-up of 9 years.32 Prediabetes decreased total brain and white matter volume, whereas diabetic patients showed an increase in the volume of white matter hyperintensities over time. Similarly, in a subset of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study, diabetic participants with HbA1c ≥7% had smaller global and regional brain volumes as well as larger white matter hyperintensities versus diabetic participants with HbA1c &lt;7% or non-diabetic individuals.33 However, here, and in other observational studies, direct causation between diabetes-related changes on MRI and cognitive performance could not be concluded, although the interaction persists after controlling for cardiovascular contributors.33, 34

This link between diabetes, dementia, and concurrent pathophysiologic processes (e.g., neurovascular disease) is complex; however, some studies still demonstrate a strong direct link between diabetes and dementia. In participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, there was an indirect association between type 2 diabetes with increased cortical atrophy (i.e., decreased baseline cortical thickness), which in turn correlated with greater cognitive decline.35 Similarly, the Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds Study showed diabetes was linked to higher odds of cognitive impairment, even after controlling for dementia risk factors, such as education, ethnicity, smoking, hypertension, and vascular brain injury, suggesting diabetes impacts dementia via other factors or directly.36

6.1.1 Brain functional MRI

Several studies have utilized functional MRI (fMRI), to investigate the impact of diabetes on neural network activity in the context of dementia (Table 1).37 fMRI detects changes in brain blood flow in participants in a resting state or while performing cognitive tasks in the MRI scanner. The increased regional blood flow serves as a surrogate of enhanced regional neural activity. Thus, assessing neural network function and connectivity by fMRI enhances structural findings from regular MRI imaging.

Participants with type 2 diabetes exhibit reduced connectivity of the default mode network and related structures on resting state fMRI, paralleling changes seen in cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders.38, 39 Furthermore, this change is more pronounced in participants with both type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment.37, 40 Interestingly, a dose of intranasal insulin appears to restore connectivity between hippocampus and the default mode network.41 In the majority of task-based fMRI studies, participants with type 2 diabetes tend to perform more poorly on recall tasks, with concomitant decreased activation in structures underpinning the tested cognitive functions.37

The inseparable link between diabetes and vascular pathology, and the reliance of most fMRI studies on blood-oxygen level-based contrast, advocates caution interpreting these nevertheless compelling studies. It is possible diabetes contributes to dementia via both microvascular insults causing downstream neurodegeneration, or directly through insulin resistance in neurons and impaired network function. Since fMRI studies rely on the link between neural activation and blood flow, disrupting this presumed relationship may undermine the conclusions of fMRI studies linking diabetes directly to neural function. Approaches to account for altered neurovascular coupling can be undertaken,42 and further studies linking diabetes-related imaging changes and dementia will help tease apart this Gordian knot.

6.1.2 Brain positron emission tomography

Use of functional imaging may provide an additional dimension of data to link disease processes in diabetes with dementia and cognitive decline. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a modality that imparts a biochemical dimension to imaging data. PET can leverage 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG) uptake (FDG-PET) as a measure of regional brain glucose metabolism. FDG-PET shows reduced uptake in brain regions of participants with prediabetes and diabetes similar to brain regions with glucose hypometabolism in participants with Alzheimer’s disease (Table 1).43–45 Moreover, markers of peripheral insulin resistance also correlate with impaired brain metabolism.43 Interestingly, intranasal insulin enhanced cognition in some domains in a small pilot clinical study of Alzheimer’s disease particiapants.44 Studies are generally small and confounding parameters may limit interpretation, but their potential significance is intriguing.

PET imaging is also performed using radiolabeled compounds that bind to amyloid-β. This PET modality has been used to test the hypothesis that impaired insulin signaling directly exacerbates the formation of amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. An early study did not find that insulin resistance correlated to amyloid-β burden using both [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET and autopsy studies.46 Indeed, in a subset of the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability, individuals with positive PiB-PET had slightly better glucose homeostasis, but possibly not after adjusting for covariates.47, 48 However, in the Health2000 study, individuals with midlife insulin resistance associated with elevated PiB-PET positivity.49 In the more recent MEMENTO cohort, diabetes was linked to elevated uptake of amyloid-β-binding radiotracers (18F-florbetapir or 18F-flutemetamol).50 Diabetes appeared to contribute to neurodegeneration markers, which, in turn, correlated strongly to cognitive decline, even after controlling for Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers and small vessel disease.50

The interplay between imaging modality and radiotracer properties, timing of imaging, and a host of other diabetes and dementia risk factors continues to make this field complex yet promising.

6.2 Omics technologies

Omics technologies generate large amounts of data in a system-wide manner by agnostically querying molecular pathways. They are extremely useful for shedding light on complex diseases or querying the intersection or shared biology between two conditions. We examined the literature and found applications of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to elucidate the relationship between type 2 diabetes and dementia. Data from these studies can help address current knowledge gaps by evaluating shared genetic risk between type 2 diabetes and dementia, as well as shared biological pathways, which may provide insight for therapeutic approaches.

6.2.1 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

Although primarily considered a metabolically-acquired disease, type 2 diabetes does possess a component of polygenic inheritance.27 Similarly, dementia, e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, occurs from a combination of common and rare causative and risk genes of variable penetrance, either monogenic or belonging to a polygenic risk profile.5 Heritability in Alzheimer’s disease is 60 to 80%;5 however, since many variants are not causative, risk may be reduced by modifiable factors, such as metabolism or metabolic dysfunction, as occurs in type 2 diabetes.

Analyses of several GWAS studies have been performed to determine whether type 2 diabetes genes overlap with those for dementia, with both positive and negative findings (Table 2). Studies have found associations of genetic risk for type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits, e.g., HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction, with Alzheimer’s disease,51–54 dementia,54 and cerebrovascular disease.55 GWAS of lacunar stroke found association with type 2 diabetes.56 Studies that examined functional and pathway enrichment identified shared and recurrent pathways in immune responses, cell signaling, neuronal plasticity and cellular processes52

Conversely, some GWAS investigations yielded no correlations between genetic disposition for diabetes to cognitive impairment57 or Alzheimer’s disease.58, 59 One study found that type 2 diabetes, which was associated with some genetic risk, did predispose to cognitive impairment although it did not share genetic risk with dementia.57 Negative findings employed a targeted panel of type 2 diabetes SNPs in participants with Alzheimer’s disease versus genome-wide investigations, which may have missed less well-known SNP associations.58 Alternatively, a negative study used GWAS from participants defined as having cognitive impairment, rather than dementia, which may constitute a less strongly defined genetic entity.57

However, overall, GWAS studies support the possibility that patients with type 2 diabetes may have some genetic risk for dementia. Diabetes could potentially prove a less modifiable risk for some individuals harboring genetic risk.

6.2.2 Epigenome-wide association studies

Epigenetic modifications, which are altered both by genetic and lifestyle factors, have also been investigated as contributors to pathological mechanisms driving cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome (Table 3).60, 61 Indeed, aging alters methylation patterns62, 63 and changes in methylation are proposed as potential early biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease.63, 64 In a group of Mexican Americans with a high burden of the metabolic syndrome, there were changes in DNA methylation at multiple sites in the buffy coat from blood in participants with versus without cognitive impairment.61 Pathway enrichment found these differentially methylated sites were related to metabolic dysfunction and inflammation. Although the study did not investigate correlation between type 2 diabetes and dementia, it did suggest possible epigenetic differences in mild cognitive impairment related to peripheral metabolism. A longitudinal study in older participants with type 2 diabetes showed that over 18 months, participants who developed presymptomatic dementia had changes at 10 methylation sites in blood similar to those seen in participants with clinical Alzheimer’s disease.60 Overall, epigenetic studies demonstrate some changes, although validation studies are needed, including correlations specifically between type 2 diabetes with cognitive impairment and dementia.

6.2.3 Transcriptomics

There have been multiple studies investigating transcriptomic changes that are associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome (Table 3).65–68 Neurons isolated from autopsy brains from participants with type 2 diabetes exhibit transcriptomic signatures indicative of impaired insulin signaling and metabolism along with neurodegeneration, including enrichment of Alzheimer’s disease pathways.65 When comparing transcriptomic data from type 2 diabetes tissue (brain and endothelial precursor cells) versus Alzheimer’s disease tissue (brain), many differentially expressed genes and related pathways overlapped, including those related to autophagy and the immune system.66–68 However, it is important to note that these studies often combine datasets and/or have a limited number of samples.

6.2.4 Proteomics &amp; metabolomics

Additional studies have focused on proteomic and metabolomic analyses to understand type 2 diabetes in the context of cognitive impairment (Table 3).69 Many of these studies show changes in various apolipoproteins related to fat or cholesterol metabolism, as well as in proteins related to the immune system or inflammation, such as complement C4.69 The recurrence of apolipoproteins as differential metabolites in Alzheimer’s disease underscores APOE4 as a major risk gene.28 Moreover, lipoproteins are defining metabolites in the metabolic syndrome.14 In Mexican Americans, proteomics signatures, which adopt an inflammatory component in patients with diabetes, are predictive for mild cognitive impairement.70 Additionally, when comparing proteomics signatures in type 2 diabetes participants with and without mild cognitive impairement,71 proteins involved in fat metabolism as well as mitophagy or autophagy were differentially regulated. Conversely, intermittent fasting in healthy participants generated a proteomics signature indicative of protection against metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and Alzheimer’s disease.72

6.3 Data integration approaches

Powerful bioinformatics tools facilitate the integration of multiple Omics datasets, which may yield additional insight into the connection between type 2 diabetes and dementia. In an integrative study of genomics and longitudinal metabolomics with Alzheimer’s disease risk factors, network analysis revealed that multiple plasma and cerebrospinal fluid metabolites clustered around Alzheimer’s disease risk factors.73 Interestingly, no gene directly clustered to an Alzheimer’s disease risk factor, suggesting that metabolites may mediate the Alzheimer’s disease risk factor-gene relationship. Moreover, Omics datasets can be merged with spatial modalities, such as PET and MRI. A recent study of PET integrated with spatial gene expression and SNPs of Alzheimer’s disease and type 2 diabetes yielded new mechanistic insights. The study found that 15 risk genes correlated to FDG-PET brain metabolism in controls versus probable Alzheimer’s disease participants. Five genes explained 72.5% of glucose uptake variance across the control group regions, whereas 4 genes accounted for 79.3% across regions of the probable AD Alzheimer’s disease. Changes were linked to expression of the TOMM40 gene (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog), implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a potential driver of disease.74

6.4 Other technologies

Additional technologies that may shed some light on potential mechanisms of type 2 diabetes in dementia include single-cell RNA-sequencing,75 spatial transcriptomics,76 and metagenomics (i.e., microbiome).77 However, we did not find clinical studies or studies of human tissue using these methods in type 2 diabetes and dementia. Immunophenotyping may also be a relevant approach given the importance of “immunosenescence”, a drop in immune function with aging, and “inflammaging”, a low-grade chronic inflammation, in type 2 diabetes (obesity)78, 79 and dementia.80, 81

7. Final recommendations

The Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care has posted its recommendations for all risk factors for dementia.6, 7 Here, we focus on recommendations specifically revolving around diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome to mitigate personal risk. Moreover, we also post recommendations regarding future research directions to address the knowledge gaps involving diabetes and dementia.

Population-wide:

Launch public health campaigns to raise awareness about the link between diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and sedentary lifestyle with dementia. Campaigns can encourage lifestyle changes linked to diet, exercise, and weight loss, which could mitigate dementia risk.

Individual-specific:

Individuals can take precautions based on their personal lifestyle and health situation:

Individuals with diabetes can adopt a healthy diet and exercise; presently, the Mediterranean diet is recommended, but there is no recommendation regarding the optimal type of exercise.7 Evidence regarding anti-diabetic drugs on dementia risk remains sparse.

Individuals with obesity can also adopt a healthy diet and exercise. Although short-term benefits of weight loss have been reported, evidence regarding the long-term benefits of weight loss on dementia risk remains sparse.7

Individuals with hypertension can take prescribed anti-hypertensive medications to maintain systolic (≥130 mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (≥85 mmHg) within healthy limits.7

Prevention is better than treatment. Since anti-diabetic drugs may not lower risk of dementia, it may be too late to reverse risk from diabetes once the disease has progressed. Prevention strategies that avoid diabetes onset may be the best risk-modifying approach.

In addition to changes regarding metabolism, education, mental activity and stimulation, and social engagement could enhance cognitive resilience and reserve.6, 7

Research directions:

The goal of research is to fill the current knowledge gaps to improve prospects for patients. For diabetes patients at risk of dementia, it will be necessary to:

Conduct prospective, carefully-designed long-running studies to generate the needed data.

Identify early changes in brain biomarkers in prediabetes and diabetes patients who are at elevated risk of dementia. Identify the early changes in the brain associated with imminent onset of dementia and correlate these changes to clinical and/or genetic variables.

Develop a polygenic risk score in diabetes for greater risk of dementia to identify patients most predisposed to dementia onset and development.

Conduct clinical studies that target the metabolic syndrome more broadly through diet, medical weight loss, bariatric surgery, and exercise to determine whether this multi-pronged approach more effectively prevents dementia onset than anti-diabetic drugs alone.

Conduct clinical studies of early interventions against modifiable risk factors to assess whether dementia may be preventable if addressed early.

Conduct research on shared molecular pathways to develop mechanism-based, potentially disease-modifying therapies.

Search criteria

For the “Innovative methods” section, we searched PubMed for English language articles involving human studies in July 2022 mostly published within the 5 past years using the terms “diabetes, dementia” or “diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease” with “functional MRI”, “PET”, “GWAS”, “EWAS”, “epigenome-wide association studies”, “transcriptomics”, “proteomics”, “metabolomics”, “single-cell RNA-sequencing”, “spatial transcriptomics”, “metagenomics”. Abstracts from the search results were assessed for their relevance to the review topic. Representative papers on “functional MRI”, “PET”, and “GWAS” were selected based on their overall quality and their relevance to the review topic; all relevant articles identified by the other search terms were included. Articles for the “data integration” subsection were obtained from reading abstracts from all other searches. For the “Type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome increase dementia risk” section, which was not a comprehensive review of the literature, the authors used articles from their reference database.
