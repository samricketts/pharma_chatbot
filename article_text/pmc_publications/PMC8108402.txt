Background:

Little is known about the prevalence of polypharmacy, the taking of five or more medications a day, in older adults with specific dementia risk factors.

Objectives:

To examine the prevalence of polypharmacy in participants at baseline in a vascular risk reduction focused Alzheimer’s disease (rrAD) trial targeting older patients with hypertension and elevated dementia risk.

Methods:

We conducted a detailed review of medications in a cross-sectional study of community-dwelling older adults with hypertension and elevated dementia risk. Medications were identified in a structured interview process with an onsite pharmacist or qualified designee. Polypharmacy was defined as use of five or more medications on a regular basis. Descriptive analyses were conducted on the sample as well as direct comparisons of subgroups of individuals with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia.

Results:

The 514 rrAD participants, mean age 68.8 (standard deviation [sd] 6), reported taking different combinations of 472 unique medications at their baseline visit. The median number of medications taken by participants was eight [Range 0 – 21], with 79.2% exhibiting polypharmacy (n=407). Sites differed in their prevalence of polypharmacy, X2(3)=56.0, p&lt;0.001. A nearly identical percentage of the 2077 prescribed (51.8%) and over the counter (48.2%) medications were present in the overall medication profile. The presence of diabetes (87.5%), hyperlipidemia (88.2%), or both (97.7%) was associated with a higher prevalence of polypharmacy than participants who exhibited hypertension in the absence of either of these conditions (63.2%), X2(3)=35.8, p&lt;0.001.

Conclusions:

Participants in a dementia risk study had high levels of polypharmacy, with the co-existence of diabetes or hyperlipidemia associated with a greater prevalence of polypharmacy as compared to having hypertension alone.

1. Introduction

The number of elderly in the United States is expanding at an unprecedented pace, with number of individuals aged 65 and older expected to increase from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million in 2060 [1]. The vast majority of older adults have at least one chronic condition, and a significant percentage exhibit more than one chronic condition [2–4]. For example, a review of Medicare claims data revealed that 67% of beneficiaries aged 65 or older had two or more chronic conditions [5]. While there is no one uniform definition, polypharmacy is commonly defined as the taking of five or more medications a day [6,7]. The prevalence of polypharmacy varies widely from 30–60% in older adults depending on which studies are cited [8–11].

While polypharmacy is appropriate and necessary in many older patients, there is also well-established documentation of polypharmacy being associated with negative outcomes [6,12]. In particular, inappropriate polypharmacy is associated with increased falls, frailty, and reduced quality of life [13–16]. Negative polypharmacy effects are in large part due to the complexities related to overtreatment, under treatment, and the presence of deleterious drug-drug interactions [11]. Because the beneficial and negative effects of individual medications are largely determined in clinical trials focused on a single medication regimen, and the fact that Beers Criteria and other pharmacomanagement tools do not provide hard actionable guidelines to comprehensively prevent overtreatment or underuse, the marginal benefits and harms associated with polypharmacy are largely unknown [17]. The specific contribution of over-the-counter (OTC) medications to the incidence and effects of polypharmacy have similarly not been firmly established, particularly as pertaining to older patients with specific chronic conditions including hypertension. Additionally, while there is a great deal known about the presence of polypharmacy in patients with dementia, little is known about the prevalence of polypharmacy in older non-demented persons with elevated risk factors for dementia. Understanding the prevalence and effects of polypharmacy associated with specific chronic conditions and dementia risk factors is needed in order to successfully guide evidence-based pharmacomanagement strategies in the future.

Risk reduction for Alzheimer’s disease (rrAD) is a randomized clinical trial that is being conducted to examine the ability of vascular risk reduction focused interventions to delay or prevent cognitive decline and impairment in older patients with hypertension [18]. In the current study we examined the baseline characteristics and prevalence of polypharmacy in all 514 participants enrolled in the rrAD study. In addition, we sought to characterize the profile of both the prescribed and OTC medication for rrAD participants. We hypothesized that because of the presence of hypertension the majority of rrAD participants would exhibit high levels of polypharmacy, and that the presence of other chronic conditions such as diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia would be further associated with an increase in the prevalence of polypharmacy.

2. Methods

2.1 Study subjects

The rrAD trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02913664). The inclusion criteria for the rrAD study include being sedentary, hypertensive, and having a concern for memory loss and/or first-degree relative with dementia. Patients with managed diabetes were allowed to enroll as long as they did not require insulin [18]. A total of 514 study subjects were randomized into the rrAD study and used for these analyses (www.rradtrial.org). Study subjects were enrolled at four study sites (University of Texas Southwestern [UTSW], University of Kansas Medical Center [KU], Pennington Biomedical Research Center [PBRC], Washington University St Louis [WashU]) using inclusion and exclusion criteria and methodologies reported previously [18]. Three of the research centers are large medical centers located in high density population urban areas (UTSW, KU, WashU), while PBRC is a research only clinic located in less dense urban setting. Briefly, study participants were required to be between 60–85 years of age (inclusive), have concerns about their memory or a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) with a diagnosis of dementia, meet criteria for sedentary lifestyle, have hypertension, and have no clinical evidence for dementia. For hypertension, patients were required to have a systolic blood pressure of between 130 and 180 mmHg, or a systolic blood pressure 110 and 130 mmHg when being treated for hypertension. Sedentary lifestyle was defined as not meeting the CDC physical activity standard of 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days per week or 20 minutes of vigorous activity 3 days per week. Patients with diabetes that could be managed in the absence of insulin were allowed to enroll. All study procedures were approved by UTSW and the institutional review board at each of the other three sites and each participant provided written, informed consent.

2.2 Demographic and medication data

rrAD study records are acquired and maintained on a secure web application for building and managing online clinical research records and databases, REDCap [19]. During the initial screening visit after consent participants were asked about basic demographics, medical history, and to list all current medication usage including prescriptions, OTC, and supplements. Screening visits were conducted by clinic coordinators at each site that had been certified for screening procedures and assigned to the study. All medication usage was collected by an onsite pharmacist or a trained and qualified designee (physician assistant, clinic coordinator, etc). All medications were typed in by staff. Study forms could accommodate up to 25 medications and supplements. Dosage, route, and frequency were not recorded.

Following completion of study-wide enrollment, baseline demographic data and all medications recorded at the initial screening visit were requested from the coordinating center for all sites. Non-standard medication names were checked independently for spelling by two staff. When a non-standard spelling, brand or generic name or formulation was found, the generic name was substituted based on consensus of the two staff members. A board-certified geriatrician categorized all drugs for primary indication.

2.3 Statistical analyses

All analyses were performed using R (R Core Team, Version 3.6.1, Vienna Austria). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify site-specific differences age and education. Chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test for site differences in categorical demographics and polypharmacy prevalence. For comparing prevalence of polypharmacy in subgroups of hyperlipidemia, diabetes and hyperlipidemia+diabetes we used Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel testing with correction across sites. To protect against Type I error, alpha was set at 0.05.

3. Results

3.1 Participant Demographics

Randomization for the rrAD study completed on October 17, 2019 with 514 individuals. Table 1 provides demographics for the enrollees. Age and sex distribution did not differ between sites. However, the sites had differing proportions of individuals identifying as an ethno-racial minority (X2(15)=55.1, p&lt;0.001). Sites also differed in the proportion of individuals actively managing a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia (X2(3)=29.1, p&lt;0.001). Participants at one site reported slightly lower formal educational attainment (p=0.03). Participants enrolled in the rrAD study reported taking a median of 8 medications [range 0–21], with 79.2% of participants exhibiting polypharmacy (Table 1). Sites differed in their prevalence of polypharmacy, with PBRC reporting the highest prevalence (91.8%) and UTSW reporting the lowest prevalence (58.1%), X2(3)=56.0, p&lt;0.001.

3.2 Medications and Polypharmacy

A total of 4008 prescribed and OTC medications were reported in rrAD participants at baseline. This included 436 unique medications in 32 indication categories (Table 2). A total of 2077 (51.8%) of the medications required prescriptions and the remaining 1931 (48.2%) were over-the-counter (OTC) medications or supplements. Across all sites, the most common three medications at the time of enrollment were supplements (31.0% of all medications), anti-hypertensives (15.9% of all medications), and hyperlipidemia medications (7.4% of all medications) (Table 2). In addition to these highly prevalent medications, medications for cardiovascular function and depression were the next most common set of medications at most sites.

The five most common prescription medications at baseline were: atorvastatin (n=141, 27.4% of enrollees), amlodipine (n=135, 26.3% of enrollees), losartan (n=130, 25.3% of enrollees), lisinopril (n=106, 20.6% of enrollees), levothyroxine (n=91, 17.7% of enrollees). The five most common OTC medications at baseline were: multivitamin (n=207, 40.3% of enrollees), aspirin (n=205, 39.9% of enrollees), d vitamin (n=166, 32.3% of enrollees), b vitamin (n=114, 22.2% of enrollees), omega 3 fatty acids (n=101, 19.6% of enrollees).

We next sought to examine whether the breakdown of polypharmacy was different between participants with hypertension only, hypertension + hyperlipidemia, hypertension + diabetes, and hypertension + hyperlipidemia + diabetes (Table 3). These subgroups were significantly different with regard to the prevalence of polypharmacy, X2(3)=35.8, p&lt;0.001. Of the 127 individuals with hypertension only, 63.2% reported polypharmacy. Of the 231 individuals with hypertension + hyperlipidemia, 88.2% reported polypharmacy. Of the eight individuals with hypertension + diabetes, 87.5% reported polypharmacy. Of the 42 individuals with hypertension + hyperlipidemia + diabetes, 97.7% reported polypharmacy.

4. Discussion

While increased prevalence of polypharmacy is known to occur in older patients [6–10] more research is needed to understand the contribution of specific chronic conditions, and specific combinations of chronic conditions, to the medication profile of older patients. Little is currently known in terms of how the presence of specific chronic conditions influence the prevalence of polypharmacy in the older patient population. This study identified that the majority of the overall rrAD sudy participants were observed to exhibit polypharmacy (79.2%), with nearly all participants who had the coexistence of hypertension with either diabetes or hyperlipidemia exhibiting polypharmacy. These data are consistent with previous studies showing that the presence of multiple co-morbidities increases the prevalence of polypharmacy. While the prevalence of polypharmacy in the current study (79.2%) are relatively high compared to the majority of polypharmacy studies to date, these data also suggest the possibility that the presence of multiple vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) in particular may be particularly potent mediators for increasing prevalence of polypharmacy in older patients.

The most current guidelines from the College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommend that a systolic blood pressure treatment goal of less than 130 mm Hg for non-institutionalized ambulatory community dwelling adults &gt; 65 years of age [20]. Reductions in a number of morbidities have been observed in clinical trials examining the beneficial effects of such intensive versus standard blood pressure control in older patients [21]. Of relevance to the rrAD study the results from the SPRINT-MIND study suggested that intensive blood pressure control may be beneficial in reducing cognitive impairment and all cause dementia in older hypertensive patients [21,22]. A recent analysis from the SPRINT trial showed that benefit of intensive BP lowering in preventing cardiovascular events was independent of baseline medication burden [23]. It will be important in future studies to understand how the presence of polypharmacy potentially influences the cognitive outcomes associated with intensive blood pressure control in older patients. Since SPRINT trial did not include patients with diabetes mellitus, there will be a need to define the potential contribution of polypharmacy towards health outcomes where diabetes and hyperlipidemia coexist with hypertension in older patients. The majority of clinical trials conducted to date do not include analysis of the potential influence of polypharmacy on study outcomes, even though there is a potential for the negative effects of some forms of polypharmacy to influence study outcomes. Key to the success of developing long-term intensive blood pressure pharmacomanagement strategies will be the elimination of the overtreatment, undertreatment, and drug-drug interactions associated with harmful polypharmacy.

The majority of polypharmacy studies in the literature have not described the profile of medications in terms of prescribed versus OTC medications. In the present study we observed that there was a nearly equal amount of prescribed and OTC medications in the medication profile of patients. The most commonly reported OTC were B-vitamins, D-vitamins, aspirin, multivitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids. These findings were consistent with previous reports of high OTC medication use in memory clinic patients [24]. Despite the dramatic increase in the use of OTC vitamins and supplements there is limited evidence of their efficacy outside of conditions where deficiencies are present [25]. Some evidence suggests use of multivitamins and supplements do substantially improve overall micronutrient status [26]. On the other hand, aspirin is now discouraged from the 2019 ACC/AHA guideline for routine use in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [27], particularly among adults over the age of 70 or adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding due to consistent lack of benefit in recent clinical trials [28,29]. Since almost 40% of our study participants report regular aspirin use, implementation of the new guideline could potentially reduce the burden of polypharmacy in some participants. It is important to point out that there is the potential for preventable interactions between prescribed medications and supplements, in particular events associated with increased risk of renal failure and hemorrhagic complications [30–33]. Increased incidence of potentially negative interactions between prescribed medications and supplements has increased dramatically [34], with our study suggesting that this may be a particularly important area of polypharmacy to investigate in older hypertensive patients in the future.

One of the unique features of this study is that our analysis is focused on the prevalence of polypharmacy in older individuals with hypertension who also exhibit an increased risk profile for the development of dementia. The presence of polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate medications are known to be elevated in patients with dementia [35–38], but little is known about the prevalence of polypharmacy in non-demented individuals who have an elevated profile of risk factors for the development of dementia. In regression analyses controlling for comorbid conditions polypharmacy in older patients was strongly linked to cognitive impairment [39], but it is less clear what the potential impact towards cognitive function may be for polypharmacy in the context of older patients with one or more chronic conditions, including hypertension. The negative effects associated with inappropriate polypharmacy include an increased risk of frailty, falls, and reduced quality of life [13–15, 29,40,41]. A number of commonly prescribed medications have the potential to negatively modulate cognitive function including anticholinergics, sedatives, and proton pump inhibitors [42–45]. In future studies it will be important to determine the potential contribution of these medications to cognitive decline and the development of dementia in older hypertensive patients. We will also be able to add to our knowledge of drug interactions by examining secondary adverse and beneficial outcomes once the study is completed.

A primary limitation of this study is that the cohort reflects a clinical trial population and therefore not necessarily reflective of the general population of patients with hypertension and co-morbidities. A limited number of minority participants enrolled, and individuals at baseline visits were required to meet study inclusion criteria. Clinical trial enrollees may be more motivated to adhere to the medication regimen and therefore the incidence of side effects may differ from the general population. There should be caution in extending the prevalence of polypharmacy in the rrAD trial to the general the larger patient population due to the potential for under or overreporting of medications as part of being in a clinical trial. Additionally, the study sample had a relatively low mean age and high level of education attainment. The design of the current study did not allow for making determinations of appropriate or inappropriate polypharmacy for individual study subjects.

In conclusion, the rrAD clinical trial affords an opportunity to assess current polypharmacy and the prevalence of pharmacomanagment practices in several U.S. locations. The inclusion of OTC medications and supplements provides a more complete picture of daily medication intake. This has important implications for comorbidity and dementia risk management.
