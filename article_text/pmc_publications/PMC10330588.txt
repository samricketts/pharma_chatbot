Background:

Understanding concordance between informants’ and cognitively impaired participants’ information reporting is crucial for Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s related dementia studies.

Methods:

The Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi-Cognitive is a community-based cohort study. Households in Nueces County, Texas, USA, were randomly identified. 330 dyads of participants and their named informants answered questions. Models were generated to examine which predictors, including age, gender, ethnicity, cognitive function, and relationship to informant, influenced answer discordance.

Results:

For demographic items, female participants and participants with spouses/partners as informants had significantly less discordance, with incidence rate rations (IRRs) of 0.65 (CI= 0.44, 0.96) and 0.41 (CI= 0.23, 0.75), respectively. For health items, better cognitive function of the participant was associated with less discordance, with an IRR of 0.85 (CI=0.76, 0.94).

Conclusions:

Demographic information concordance is most associated with gender and informant-participant relationship. Level of cognitive function is most associated with concordance for health information.

pmcIntroduction

In clinical Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s related dementia research (AD/ADRD), there is no gold standard method to collect “true” information regarding the participant with cognitive impairment. There is a gap in the literature of best methods for gathering information from cognitively impaired participants. In the cancer literature, previous studies have examined concordance between participant and informant with respect to participant’s symptom assessment and health outcomes post-chemotherapy treatment [1]. Within aging research, one study examined concordance between the informant and participant accuracy in describing the participant’s amyloid-β PET scan results for Alzheimer’s Disease assessment after being told the results by a physician [2]. However, there is no precedent detailing who is most accurate in reporting objective information about the study participants’ demographics and health history. The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) uses “proxy” respondents when the participant is not able to do an interview themselves, whether that is due to physical or cognitive barriers [3]. However, concerns with accuracy arise when someone other than the participant answers questions on their behalf. Studies may acquire demographic and health information from both the participant with cognitive dysfunction and the informant (usually caregiver), but determining when to supplement participant responses with informant contributions remains unclear. Further, obtaining responses from both participants and informants requires more time and may also lead to conflicting answers.

The Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi-Cognitive (BASIC-C) project is a community-based, prospective cohort study that investigates aging and caregiving longitudinally in a bi-ethnic community. In the current paper, we sought to analyze the concordance of answers between participants and informants about the participants’ demographic and health information and determine what factors influence rates of discordance. The results can have implications for streamlining research methods and collecting the most accurate data possible for AD/ADRD research.

Methods

Sample

The methods of the community-based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi-Cognitive (BASIC-C) project were previously reported [4]. For the current paper, households were randomly identified in Nueces County, Texas, USA, a predominantly urban county with residents living in the city of Corpus Christi. The population estimate was 340,233 in 2020, 14.9% of which are age 65 and older. Of the population aged 65 and older, 50.7% are of Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity, and 43.4% are of non-Hispanic White ethnicity. Most of the Hispanic/Latinx population are non-immigrant US citizens of Mexican American heritage [5].

Participants ≥age 65 were recruited using door-to-door (5/1/2018-3/15/2020) and, after the COVID pandemic onset, phone (04/20/2020-2/11/22) recruitment. Individuals with possible cognitive impairment were identified using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during door-to-door recruitment and Telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) during phone recruitment. Participants who scored ≤25 and ≤18 on the MoCA and T-MoCA respectively were eligible for participation [6]. Named informants and participants both answered questions regarding the participants’ demographics and health status.

The analysis sample included 101 Non-Hispanic White and 229 Mexican American participants and their named informants. All 330 participant-informant dyads completed participant demographic and health questions as part of their participation in study interviews. Participant reports were obtained during baseline data collection. Informants provided data at their baseline or 2-year follow-up interviews.

Predictors

Model predictors included participant demographics (age, gender, ethnicity), cognitive performance (as measured by the MoCA), and informant relationship to the participant (spouse/partner, child, other family member, friend/neighbor/other). Cognitive performance scores derived from alternate versions of the MoCA-30, such as those administrated by telephone or modified for participants with physical limitations, were converted to MoCA-30 equivalence scores [7]. Mean centered harmonized MoCA scores were introduced to the model as a linear predictor.

Outcome Measures

A report discordance indicator (0=concordance/1=discordance) was created for each participant demographic/health question. A rating of 1 was assigned when dyad answers did not match or when one partner provided a response and the other did not know the answer or refused to answer.

Discordant report indicators with greater than 10% discordant report rates were included in the calculation of demographic and health report composite scores for use as model outcomes. The demographic composite score (range 0-2) included the sum of discordant report ratings from two demographic questions: participant date of birth (day, month and year) and participant education (high school or less, trade school/college, graduate education). The health composite score (range 0-6) included the sum of discordant report ratings from 6 health questions (participant alcohol use and whether participant had been told by a doctor that he/she had high blood pressure, stroke, heart disease, dementia, and diabetes).

Analysis

Negative binomial (NB) regression models were used to explore the association between discordant report counts and the predictors. Separate models were run for each composite score: count of discordant demographic reports and count of discordant health reports. Participant demographics (age, gender, ethnicity), cognitive performance and informant relationship to the participant were entered as predictors. Deviance goodness-of-fit tests were performed to assess model fit to the composite count outcomes. Maximum likelihood estimates for model predictors were calculated to obtain incident rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals. IRRs and 95% CIs were calculated by exponentiating model estimates generated for model predictors to examine association with discordant report rates. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4. Reasonable requests for data sharing will be considered by the corresponding author based on IRB approvals and existing data use agreements.

Results

Descriptive

Demographic information for the 330 dyads is demonstrated in Table 1. The composite variable scores for discordance of the demographic items and the health items ranged from 0 to 2 and 0 to 6, respectively. A score of 0 indicated no discordance for either demographic or health items, and a score of 2 for the demographic items and 6 for the health items indicated complete discordance. The frequency of pairs that obtained each composite variable score can be seen in Table 2 for demographic items and health items. The overall frequency of discordant answers was 18%; 17.8% for demographic items 19.2% for health items. The mean composite variable score for health items was 0.3 for demographic items and 1.2 for health items. Discordant counts and discordance frequency for all items can be found in table 3.

Model for demographic item discordance

For the demographic composite count score, 69.4% of dyads showed no discordance in their responses, 25.8% were discordant on 1 of the 2 items, and 4.9% had discordance on both questions. Discordant counts for each demographic item can be seen in Table 3A.

IRRs and 95% CIs were calculated for each model predictor to examine the association between predictor and discordant report rate. Results for the regression model of the discordant count for the demographic variables are summarized in Table 4. Female participants had significantly lower counts of discordant reports compared to males (IRR=0.65, 95% CI=0.44,0.96). Spouse/partner informants had significantly lower rates of discordant responses (IRR=0.41, 95% CI= 0.23, 0.75) when compared to child informants. Friends/neighbors/other (IRR=2.18, 95% CI= 1.25, 3.79) and other family members (IRR=1.69, 95% CI= 1.05, 2.69) showed significantly higher counts of discordant reports compared to child informants. The deviance goodness of fit test for this model (p-value= 0.99) suggested a strong degree of model fit to the data.

Model for health item concordance

For the health composite count score, 29.7% dyads had a score of no discordance, 38.2% had discordance on one item, 23.3% had discordance on two, 6.1% had discordance on three, 1.8% had discordance on 4, 0.3% had discordance on five, and 0.6% had complete discordance on the six questions, as seen in Table 2. Discordant counts and rates of discordance for individual items can be found in Table 3B.

Results for the regression model of the discordant counts for the health item variables are summarized in Table 5. Compared to all other factors, the participant’s cognitive performance measure was the strongest predictor of higher dyad discordance in health reporting. A one standard deviation increase in participant MoCA score is associated with a 0.85 (95% CI=0.76, 0.94) fold decrease in composite counts of discordant health reports. The deviance goodness of fit test (p=0.16) indicated adequate fit of the regression model to the health composite scores.

Discussion

AD/ADRD clinical research is contingent upon accurate reporting of participant characteristics. The low composite discordance scores indicate that overall, concordance between participant and informant answers about demographic and health information was high, indicating that in many of these dyads, using only one reporter would be sufficient. As cognitive performance decreased, discordance for health information increased. For demographic information items, relationship between participant and informant modified discordance the most. These findings align with what we expect to see with cognitive impairment and dementia. Recall of recent information, such as a recent health diagnosis from a doctor, is more vulnerable to being forgotten in the dementia process than familiar autobiographical information (such as date of birth or number of years of education) [8]. Neither ethnicity nor age had any effect on concordance.

Other longitudinal aging studies also use informants instead of, or in addition to, participant reports, including the HRS as mentioned previously, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The HRS methods require that the proxy be someone who is an “insider” who knows many life details about the participant. This method is in line with our findings that spouse and partner informants have the highest rates of concordant answers for demographic questions. Research has also found that using proxies in longitudinal aging research can reduce attrition rates [9]. While the current study focuses on the consistency of data acquisition, using informants as a method to keep participants enrolled in the study can be another benefit of supplementing participant survey answers.

However, it is not necessarily true that studies should default to informant obtained information. Previous reports of participant-informant concordance for patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy showed that informants tend to overestimate the patient’s symptoms [1]. There are also instances where the participant has no informant; in fact, we previously found, in a very conservative estimate, that 7.5% of Nueces County residents aged 65 and older who met our criteria for dementia had absolutely no one they could name as an informant [10]. In these instances, there is no default for best practices. Future study may allow us to associate a cognitive assessment screening score that is associated with sufficiently high reporting accuracy to allow them to participate without informant supplementation.

One limitation of this study is that we do not know objectively true information about each participants’ demographic and clinical history. In discordant answers, we cannot determine whether the participant or informant is supplying the correct information, only that discordance signifies at least one wrong answer between the dyad. For this reason, we also cannot determine a specific MoCA or T-MoCA score cut-off that would show a benefit of using informant answers only. In future studies, to further test the benefit of acquiring information from one party over the other, it would be beneficial to find a way to obtain the “true” information though medical records or birth certificates. Though our findings are specific to a small community, we have utilized a rigorous sampling methodology.
