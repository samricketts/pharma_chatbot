Amyloid-β (Aβ) forms heterogeneous oligomers which are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Many Aβ oligomers consist of β-hairpin building blocks — Aβ peptides in β-hairpin conformations. β-Hairpins of Aβ can adopt a variety of alignments, but the role that β-hairpin alignment plays in the formation and heterogeneity of Aβ oligomers is poorly understood. To explore the effect of β-hairpin alignment on the oligomerization of Aβ peptides, we designed and studied two model peptides with two different β-hairpin alignments. Peptides Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 mimic two different β-hairpins that Aβ can form, the Aβ17–36 and Aβ17–35 β-hairpins, respectively. These hairpins are similar in composition but differ in hairpin alignment, altering the facial arrangements of the side chains of the residues they contain. X-ray crystallography and SDS-PAGE demonstrate that the difference in facial arrangement between these peptides leads to distinct oligomer formation. In the crystal state, Aβm17–36 forms triangular trimers that further assemble to form hexamers, while Aβm17–35 forms tetrameric β-barrels. In SDS-PAGE, Aβm17–36 assembles to form a ladder of oligomers, while Aβm17–35 either assembles to form a dimer or does not assemble at all. The differences in the behavior of Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 suggest β-hairpin alignment as a source of the observed heterogeneity of Aβ oligomers.

Graphical Abstract


pmcIntroduction

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is intrinsically disordered and can adopt myriad conformations, including β-sheets, α-helices, and a variety of β-hairpins.1–18 These secondary structures can direct the formation of toxic Aβ assemblies implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).4,6,9,11,12,15–18 Several studies have demonstrated that toxic Aβ oligomers consist of β-hairpin building blocks.4,6,9,12,19 Multiple β-hairpins have been reported for Aβ that differ in the alignment of the β-strands and the residues they contain.1,4,6–13,18,19 The role that β-hairpin alignment plays in the formation and heterogeneity of oligomers of Aβ is poorly understood. Atomic-level analysis of these oligomers is necessary to better understand the molecular basis of AD, but the transience of Aβ oligomers makes characterization difficult.

To better study these elusive Aβ oligomers, our laboratory has developed peptide model systems consisting of conformationally constrained β-hairpin peptides derived from Aβ.20–27 These model systems have provided a variety of high-resolution structures of oligomeric assemblies that cannot be achieved from oligomers formed by Aβ itself. In the current study, we use two similar model peptides to explore the effect of β-hairpin alignment on the assembly of peptides derived from Aβ. Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 mimic two different β-hairpins that Aβ can form, the Aβ17–36 and Aβ17–35 β-hairpins, respectively.13,18,19

Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 differ in the alignment of the β-strands that comprise each peptide. In both peptides, residues 17–23 constitute one of the β-strands. In Aβm17–36, residues 30–36 constitute the other β-strand, while in Aβm17–35, residues 29–35 constitute the other β-strand (Figure 1). This difference results in a different alignment of the peptide strands, with the bottom strand of Aβm17–36 shifted by one amino acid toward the C-terminus in comparison to Aβm17–35. Thus, Leu17 is across from Val36 in Aβm17–36, while Leu17 is across from Met35 in Aβm17–35. This shift changes the hydrogen-bonded pairs of the residues within the hairpin as well as the surface on which the side chains are displayed. The change in facial arrangement is illustrated by Figure 1, with the even-numbered side chains (green) being displayed on the “top” face in Aβm17–36 and the “bottom” face in Aβm17–35.

Notably, the chemical compositions of Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 are almost identical — Aβm17–36 contains Val36 whereas Aβm17–35 contains Gly29. The similarity of Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 makes them good candidates for exploring how β-hairpin alignment, and thus the facial arrangement of residues, affects oligomeric assembly. In this study, we compare Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 and demonstrate that the alignment of the β-hairpin can affect the assembly of peptides derived from Aβ.

Results and Discussion

Design of the Model System

Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 are cyclic hexadecapeptides consisting of two heptapeptide β-strands (Aβ17–23 and Aβ30–36 or Aβ29–35) connected by two δ-linked ornithine turn units that promote a β-hairpin-like conformation. The peptides also contain an N-methyl group on Gly33 (Aβm17–36) or Ile32 (Aβm17–35) to attenuate aggregation through intermolecular hydrogen bond formation. These features facilitate the formation of well-defined oligomers that, unlike oligomers of full-length Aβ, are amenable to high-resolution structural characterization through X-ray crystallography.

Aβm17–36 is designed to display the side chains of Val36, Leu34, Ile32, and Ala30 on the same face of the β-hairpin as the side chains of Leu17, Phe19, Ala21, and Asp23 (the LFAD face). The side chains of Met35, N-methyl-Gly33, and Ile31, as well as the side chains of Val18, Phe20, and Glu22, are in turn, displayed on the opposite face (the VFE face). Aβm17–35 is designed to display the side chains of Met35, Gly33, Ile31, and Gly29 on the LFAD face and the side chains of Leu34, N-methyl-Ile32, and Ala30 on the VFE face. Figure 1 illustrates these differences through the colors of the side chains (green and orange). While both peptides primarily consist of hydrophobic residues, the differences between the faces of Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 lead to the formation of different oligomeric assemblies.

Assembly by SDS-PAGE

Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to evaluate their propensity to oligomerize. When a 200 μM solution of Aβm17–36 is subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining, a ladder of seven bands is observed (Figure 2). The bands appear to be evenly separated by about 2 kDa, which is consistent with the molecular weight of the monomer (1.76 kDa). The lowest molecular weight band corresponds to either monomer or dimer, and the subsequent bands correspond to either dimer through heptamer, or turner through octamer. The ladderlike appearance suggests that the oligomers are formed by sequential addition of Aβm17–36 monomers. The intensities of the bands indicate that the smallest species (monomer or dimer) predominates, and that the oligomers corresponding to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth bands may be more stable than those corresponding to the third. Fewer bands are observed with decreasing concentration, suggesting that oligomer formation is concentration dependent. Alternatively, the larger oligomers may still be present at lower concentrations, but not abundant enough to reach the sensitivity limit of the silver stain.

To our knowledge, the periodic ladderlike oligomerization exhibited by Aβm17–36 has not been observed for other Aβ peptides in SDS-PAGE. Aβ1–42 typically exhibits prominent monomer, trimer, and tetramer bands in SDS-PAGE, while Aβ1–40 typically exhibits predominantly a monomer band.28–30 Ladders of oligomers are observed in SDS-PAGE when Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 are subjected to photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP).28–29 Our laboratory has also observed a ladder of oligomers upon TCEP treatment of an Aβ1–42 peptide containing an intramolecular disulfide bond.31,32

In contrast to Aβm17–36, Aβm17–35 migrates as a single diffuse band at molecular weights consistent with monomer or dimer in SDS-PAGE (Figure 2). Aβm17–35 exhibits fainter bands than Aβm17–36 at the same concentrations. Staining with Bio-Rad fluorescent stains Flamingo and Oriole also showed slightly weaker bands for Aβm17–35 compared to Aβm17–36 (data not shown). The decreased intensity of Aβm17–35 with both silver staining and fluorescent stains might reflect a greater propensity of Aβm17–35 to diffuse out of the gel during the staining process or lower solubility of Aβm17–35 leading to poorer penetration into the gel.

X-ray Crystallography

Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 both proved amenable to structural elucidation by X-ray crystallography (Figure 3). Aβm17–36 afforded crystals under conditions used previously for a homologue containing ornithine in place of Met35 (HEPES buffer and Jeffamine M-600).33 Aβm17–35 afforded crystals from a buffer consisting of bicine and Trisma and a mixture of ethylene glycol oligomers. Diffraction data for crystals of Aβm17–36 were collected to 2.05 Å in-house on a Rigaku Micromax-007HF X-ray diffractometer equipped with a copper anode. Diffraction data for crystals of Aβm17–35 were collected to 1.52 Å on the synchrotron at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The X-ray crystallographic phases of Aβm17–36 were solved by soaking the crystals in potassium iodide to incorporate iodide ions into the crystal lattice, and then performing single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing. The X-ray crystallographic phases of Aβm17–35 were solved using molecular replacement with an all-alanine model of a related β-hairpin peptide as a search model (PDB5W4H).34

Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 form different oligomers in the crystal state. The X-ray crystallographic structure of Aβm17–36 contains sixteen molecules of Aβm17–36 in the asymmetric unit. Each of the molecules folds to form a twisted β-hairpin, and variation between monomers is minimal, consisting mainly of Met35 and Leu34 rotamers. In the crystal lattice, Aβm17–36 assembles to form trimers which loosely pack into hexamers (Figure 4A). The X-ray crystallographic structure of Aβm17β35 contains two molecules of Aβm17–35 in the asymmetric unit. Both molecules fold to form twisted β-hairpins, and variation between the two monomers is minimal, consisting mainly of Met35 rotamers. The different Met35 rotamers likely aid in maximizing hydrophobic packing within the crystal lattice. In the crystal lattice, both molecules of Aβm17–35 assemble to form tetrameric β-barrels, or cylindrins35 (Figure 4B).

The trimers formed by Aβm17–36 consist of three β-hairpins in a triangular assembly with a cavity at the center of the triangle (Figure 5A). Phe20 and Phe19 sit on opposite faces at the center of the trimer, surrounding this cavity. The trimer is stabilized by hydrophobic packing of residues on both faces and by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the backbones of Val18 and Glu22 at each corner. Two trimers further pack together on the VFE face to form a hexamer. Although the hexamer is not stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the component trimers, it is stabilized by bridging water molecules that hydrogen bond to both trimers. The side chains of residues Phe20, Glu22, and Ile31 form the hydrophobic core of the hexamer, with the carboxyl groups of Glu22 sitting at the corners. Although Met35 and Gly33 also sit on the VFE face of Aβm17–36, neither appears to contribute to the packing of the trimer or hexamer.36 The remaining side chains sit outside of the hydrophobic core of the hexamer.

The tetramers formed by Aβm17–35 consist of four β-hairpins arranged around a central axis to form a β-barrel. The tetramer can be viewed as a dimer of dimers, in which two monomers assemble to form an antiparallel dimer (Figure 5B) and two antiparallel dimers further assemble to form the tetramer. The hydrophobic side chains of the LFAD face comprise the core of the tetramer. The side chains of Phe19 and Met35 lie at the center of the hydrophobic core and are buttressed by the side chains of Leu17, Ala21, and Ile31. The absence of a side chain at Gly33 facilitates the tight packing of these hydrophobic side chains, in a fashion similar to that previously reported for a cylindrin comprising three β-hairpins from αB crystallin.35 The charged residues Glu22 and Asp23 sit on the solvent-exposed ends of the Aβm17–35 cylindrin, away from the hydrophobic core. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the monomer subunits further stabilize the tetramer. The backbones of the Phe20 residues hydrogen bond to each other at the interfaces between monomers within the dimers. The backbones of the Leu34 residues hydrogen bond to each other at the interfaces between the dimers.

Although both the hexamer of Aβm17–36 and the tetramer of Aβm17–35 are stabilized by hydrophobic packing, this packing occurs on opposite faces of the peptides. The hexamer of Aβm17–36 packs on the VFE face, even though the LFAD face displays three more hydrophobic side chains (Val18, Phe20, Ile31, and Met35 vs. Leu17, Phe19, Ala21, Ala30, Ile32, Leu34, and Val36). Additional intermolecular contacts in the lattice involving Leu17 and Val36 may promote packing of the trimers on the less hydrophobic VFE face. The relatively loose packing of the trimers within the hexamer suggests that the trimer is the primary oligomeric building block in the crystal lattice. To this end, the trimer is stabilized by extensive packing of three sets of hydrophobic side chains in its center (Leu17, Phe19 Phe20, Ala21, Ile31, and Leu34).

The Aβm17–35 tetramer packs on the LFAD face, rather than the VFE face. The two faces each display the same number of hydrophobic side chains (Leu17, Phe19, Ala21, Ile31, and Met35 vs. Val18, Phe20, Ala30, Ile32, and Leu34). Packing on the LFAD face may result from better self-complementarity of this face, permitting tighter hydrophobic packing. No major hydrophobic interactions are observed between the tetramers in the lattice, despite the exterior of each tetramer presenting multiple hydrophobic side chains. Although the tetramers pack together in the lattice, the packing interactions do not appear to lead to well-defined higher-order assemblies.

The assemblies observed for Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 in the crystal state do not match the assemblies observed in SDS-PAGE. These differences likely result from the different experimental conditions required for SDS-PAGE and crystallization. SDS-PAGE is run at micromolar concentrations in a pH 6.8 Tris loading buffer containing 2% glycerol. Crystallization occurs at millimolar concentrations at pH 6.75 and pH 8.5 for Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35, respectively. The varied behaviors of Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 across different techniques is reminiscent of that of full-length Aβ peptides, for which assembly is highly dependent on experimental conditions.37–52 Peptide concentration, the presence of detergents or lipids, pH, and temperature, among other factors, can direct, alter, induce, or inhibit assembly in full-length Aβ peptides.37–52

Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 mimic just two of the many conformations that full-length Aβ can form. In this manuscript, X-ray crystallography and SDS-PAGE demonstrate that the alignment of the β-strands within an Aβ-derived β-hairpin affects how the peptide oligomerizes. The range of assemblies Aβm17–36 and Aβm17–35 form under different conditions exemplifies how β-hairpin assembly can be affected by environment and provides insight into the factors that drive the oligomerization of Aβ peptides. The current study provides evidence that β-hairpin formation, along with environmental variation, can contribute to Aβ oligomer heterogeneity. While the heterogeneity of Aβ oligomers is still an obstacle to understanding the molecular basis of AD, this study illustrates how small changes in the folding of the component Aβ monomer subunits can have profound effects upon Aβ oligomer structure and assembly.

36. The crystal structure of peptide 1a which contains the mutation M35O, further emphasizes the lack of involvement of residue 35 in this assembly (figure S#). Trimers and hexamers formed by peptides 1 and 1a are almost identical — the α-linked ornithine residue is situated similarly to the methionine it replaces, and neither contributes to the hydrophobic packing at the core of the hexamers.

52. “In ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS), the peptides remained monomeric in both the presence and absence of the non-ionic detergent DDM. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was attempted in the presence and absence of SDS, but did not provide clear insights into the assembly states of the peptides.”
53. iPSC-derived cortical neurons were treated with up to 50 μM of either peptide for 72 hours. Neither peptide exhibited toxicity by Promega assays CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay and CytoTox-Glo™ Cytotoxicity Assay (data not shown).
