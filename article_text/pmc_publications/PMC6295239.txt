Background and purpose:

The purpose of this work is to examine how diffusion and kurtosis parameters vary along the corticospinal tract and determine where along this path microstructure is compromised in patients diagnosed with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). We hypothesize that disruption of the corticospinal tract from ventricular enlargement can be measured using diffusion MRI and this will be quantified in periventricular regions.

Methods:

This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board with a waiver of consent and was HIPAA compliant. We developed a method to analyze diffusion parameters at discrete points along neural tracts. We then used diffusion MRI data from Alzheimer’s patients and healthy controls to compare whether diffusion along the cortico-spinal tract differs from that of patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.

Results:

We found that diffusion parameters can differentiate patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus from Alzheimer’s patients and healthy controls: Axial diffusion, axial kurtosis, and the axonal water fraction were found to differ significantly across groups (p &lt; 0.05) in an area located close to the superior internal capsule and corona radiate but below the cortex.

Conclusion:

Lower Axonal water fraction indicates a lower axonal density in the corticospinal tract which may indicate permanent damage. Lower axial kurtosis may imply that axons are being more aligned due to compression.


Introduction

The most widely accepted treatment for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) symptoms is ventriculo-peritoneal shunt placement, which can result in significant symptomatic amelioration, predominantly gait impairment (1). Despite the well-established clinical features and the requisite cardinal radiological feature of dilated ventricles, the mechanisms relating ventricular enlargement to clinical deficits and how fluid-dynamic alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) post-shunt placement lead to gait improvement are poorly understood.

Previous studies using structural or functional imaging have indicated that mechanical compression of cortico-spinal white matter due to ventricular enlargement is responsible for gait disturbance commonly associated with NPH (2, 3). Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) quantifies the contribution of non-Gaussian diffusion effects, such as the presence of microstructure in the brain as a result of microstructural complexity (4, 5). The White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI) (6) model is a method that relates DKI-compatible metrics to white matter microstructure by partitioning water into an intra-axonal compartment and an extra-axonal compartment and computing the Axonal Water Fraction (AWF) which is sensitive to demyelination and axonal atrophy(7–9). These biomarkers may be used to represent the pathology occurring at the mesoscopic scale.

The cortico-spinal tract (CST) is altered by mechanical deformation resulting from ventricular enlargement and we hypothesize that this compression can be measured using a combination of diffusion MRI and tractography of the CST. Here we examine how diffusion and kurtosis parameters vary along the corticospinal tract and determine where along this path microstructure is compromised in patients diagnosed with NPH. We localize pathology in NPH using an along-tract analysis of diffusion, determine whether this method can differentiate patients with NPH from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients and healthy controls, and study whether diffusion biomarkers can assess cell damage due to ventricular expansion. We study Alzheimer’s patients in addition to controls due to common radiologic features such as ventriculomegaly and the relatively common (31–75%) comorbidity of the two diseases (10). We further investigate the relationship between CST injury and the presence of leukoaraiosis in NPH. We expect that in NPH, CST disruption would be maximal in the periventricular regions deformed by the enlarged lateral ventricles and not at sites distant to these locations.

Methods

Demographics and clinical data

This retrospective, anonymized, single-center study was approved by the institutional review board with a waiver of consent and was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant. Demographics of the three patient groups (total N=35) are given in Table 1. The three groups do not statistically differ in demographic characteristics.

NPH patients were selected from a pool of patients with enlarged ventricles and gait impairment referred to the NYU Adult Hydrocephalus Evaluation Program and evaluated by a neurologist (JG) with 25 years of experience. These patients all exhibited a characteristic dyspraxic gait, variable degrees of cognitive impairment and symptoms of overactive bladder. From the initial chart review of NPH patients January 2003 and December 2014 (N=624) we selected patients who (a) completed a high-volume lumbar puncture or lumbar drain that resulted in a significant clinical improvement (clinician (JG) and family’s subjective impression of gait improvement), (N=101), (b) availability of pre-operative 3T MRI acquired locally, that included a high resolution MPRAGE sequence as well as diffusion images appropriate for DKI analysis. (N=20), and (c) were free of comorbidities such as cerebrovascular disease, coexisting intracranial mass lesion, or prior craniectomy identified by a neuro-radiologist (AG). The final sample size was 14, however 9 additional subjects scanned after December 2014 were identified from a review of 125 cases and included in the study after having found to meet criteria (b) and (c). The majority excluded from the study failed to meet criteria (a). The full population of 23 subjects with clinical presentations of NPH evaluated in this study responded positively to shunt surgery as evaluated by neurologist (JG). Of the 23 total hydrocephalus patients included in the study, there were 15 that demonstrated risk of hypertension, 7 patients with diabetes, 10 patients with hyperlipidemia, 3 patients with coronary artery disease, and 7 patients negative for any cardiovascular risk factors. Ten patients demonstrated comorbidities for two or more of the risk factors listed above.

Control subjects were recruited retrospectively from the New York University (NYU) Alzheimer’s Disease Center to undergo a full clinical research evaluation per Uniform Data Set procedures for Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (11), and a brain MRI including high resolution MPRAGE and the appropriate diffusion MRI protocol. Healthy Control subjects had no evidence of dementia or MCI and had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0. AD subjects were given a diagnosis based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(12) and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD (13), CDR ≥ 0.5 (range 0.5–2.0), and were not deemed to have any medical, neurological, or psychiatric conditions that could otherwise account for the dementia. The three groups did not statistically differ in demographic characteristics (see Table 1). Due to the sensitivity of the diffusion MRI metrics in general to age (14), age was included as a covariate in all analyses

MRI acquisition and image processing

MRI images were acquired on a 3T TIM Trio MR system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). NPH patients were scanned prior to ventricular shunt placement. The MR protocol included 3D T1-weighted imaging for anatomical reference using a magnetization prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echoes (MPRAGE) sequence, and diffusion imaging with three b-values (0, 1000, 2000 s/mm2) along 60 diffusion encoding directions using a single shot twice refocused echo-planar sequence. Data was acquired in an 88 × 80 × 30 matrix with 2.6mm x 2.6mm resolution and 5mm slice thickness. dMRI images were pre-processed by denoising using a Gaussian smoothing kernel, followed by motion and eddy current correction using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL, Analysis Group, FMRIB, Oxford, UK) and then fitting the kurtosis tensor using a constrained weighted linear least squares fit using in-house software (15) written in MatLab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The kurtosis tensors were then used to derive the DKI-acquired parametric maps of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (AK), and radial kurtosis (RK). The axonal water fraction (AWF), i.e. the ratio of intra-axonal water to intra- plus extra-axonal water, was computed in addition to standard diffusion and kurtosis measures based on a two-compartment model of neuronal tissue (7).

Along - Tract Analysis

Tracts were generated using MRtrix (Brain Research Institute; github.com/MRtrix3/mrtrix3) by manually placing seed ROIs in the cerebral peduncles and in the precentral gyrus of each subject Streamline propagation was constrained using an FA value of 0.2 and a maximum angle of 45 degrees. Streamlines were reoriented to begin at the brainstem and stretch cephalad towards the precentral gyrus, they were then truncated at the middle cerebellar peduncle and pial surface to ensure that tracts from different subjects could be compared without individual anatomy biasing results. In order to prevent partial volume effects from potentially biasing the analysis, tracts that come close to or intersect with the lateral ventricles were excluded by creating an ROI of the lateral ventricles, dilating it by one voxel, and discarding any streamline that intersected this region.

Using MatLab, tracts were normalized using cubic spline interpolation such that the same anatomy occurs at the same distance along the tract for each subject, and vertices were relocated so that there were exactly 100 vertices per streamline along the entire tract, similar to the methods used in (16). The cerebral peduncles were constrained to exist at 25% of the distance from the middle cerebellar peduncle and the anterior end of the precentral gyrus was constrained to 95%. Parametric diffusion, kurtosis, and WMTI maps were resampled onto tract vertices as scalar values. Figure 1 provides a qualitative demonstration of axial diffusion and axial kurtosis mapped into the cortico-spinal tract of a representative sample Alzheimer’s patient, healthy control, and hydrocephalus patient.

Periventricular white matter lesions were segmented for each subject based on T1 hypointensities and FLAIR hyperintensities from Freesurfer parcellation of T1 weighted MPRAGE images (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) followed by a nonlinear warp to a common space computed using FSL’s FNIRT. These segmentations were used to create leukoaraiosis probability maps to help visualize the location where this pathology is most likely to occur for NPH patients, Alzheimer’s patients, and healthy controls and to determine whether leukoaraiosis has a local impact on miscrosctrucual pathology associated with NPH.

Statistical Methods

One way ANCOVA with age as a covariate was used to compare differences between NPH and Alzheimer’s patients, NPH and healthy controls, and Alzheimer’s patients and healthy controls at each point along the CST. A Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to correct for the presence of three groups. The paired sample t-test was used to test for differences across hemispheres. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to test the diagnostic accuracy using area under the ROC curve (AUC) of each diffusion metric and determine with ones best differentiate between study groups. One way ANCOVA controlling for age was used to test for group differences in periventricular leukoaraiosis.

Results

Along – Tract Analysis

Diffusion and kurtosis measures were computed for each subject and then sampled onto the cortico-spinal tract. Out of all diffusion parameters examined during this study, Axial diffusivity, axial kurtosis, and axonal water fraction were found to differentiate subject groups with the greatest level of accuracy. Figure 2 shows example parametric maps of AD, AK, and AWF to demonstrate the quality of these parameters. Values along the CST were averaged for each hemisphere separately and groups were compared at each vertex for each diffusion parameter. Axial diffusivity differs significantly across groups (p&lt;0.05) between 65% and 85% of the distance along the tract, this area is located superior to the internal capsule but below the cortex. Online Figure 1 provides a reference image to demonstrate the anatomical location where group differences may occur. Figure 3a plots the axial diffusion as a function of the distance on the tract from the superior end of the brainstem.

Axial kurtosis demonstrated the largest difference between groups both in terms of p values lower than 0.05 and in the number of significant voxels. Figure 3b shows the change in Axial Kurtosis, which significantly differs (p&lt;0.05) between groups from 50% to 90% of the distance along the CST. Figure 3c shows the change in along-tract AWF, which significantly differs (p&lt;0.05) across groups in areas correlating with changes that occur in AK (between 67% and 86%).

Table 2 shows mean and standard deviation for all diffusion parameters analyzed during this study, as well as the results of ROC analysis in the periventricular region. AUC values for each metric at a tract-distance of 75%. 75% marks the approximate location of the corona radiata in each patient. This region was chosen because it is part of the region with the largest difference between all diffusion parameters between groups. Axial diffusivity showed the highest AUC with a value of 1.0 We also found significant differences between NPH and Alzheimer’s groups in FA values, which agree with measurements made in literature (17). In addition to increased AD and FA in NPH compared to control groups, MD was also found to be significantly increased and MK, AK, RK, and AWF were found to be significantly decreased. AUC values (NPH vs control) for MD, AD, and AK were 0.94, 1.0, and 0.98 respectively for indicating that these parameters had the highest performance in differentiating NPH from controls.

Relationship with Leukoaraiosis

The extent of leukoaraiosis was significantly greater in NPH patients (p&lt;0.05), with volumes greater than either the Alzheimer’s group or the healthy control group. Figure 4 provides leukoaraiosis probability maps for each patient group, describing the extent to which leukoaraiosis may be affecting the corticospinal tract.

Discussion

This study measured the microstructural properties of the CST in three patient cohorts, the AUC findings here suggest that AD and AK can be used as a maker to make a clinical diagnosis of NPH in the presence of a confusing radiological presentation. We found that pathology in NPH is located in the upper periventricular part of the CST extending from the superior corona radiata to the posterior internal capsule. The most striking results were found in AD, AK, and AWF parameters. AD values were found to be higher in NPH than in Alzheimer’s and control groups up to a factor of 2 while AK and AWF were found to be lower by up to 45% and 21% respectively in periventricular regions. The results found here also agree well with the work of other groups who have previously compared kurtosis measurements in white matter between NPH and controls. Kamiya et al. (17) found that in the internal capsule through corona radiata regions, FA, MD, and AD were significantly increased in NPH compared to controls, while MK was decreased compared to the control group, we found very similar results for these particular diffusion parameters (see table 2) which helps provide confidence in the accuracy of this analysis.

These measurements have implications on the relative structure of periventricular white matter tract micro-architecture in NPH. Other studies have hypothesized that white matter in NPH may be compressed due to mechanical pressure caused by ventricular dilation(18, 19). This is consistent with our observation that increase in axial diffusivity is seen in regions near the ventricle in NPH patients. In particular we find group differences in the corona radiata, where although several major white matter tracts are known to cross here, evidence of motor neurons responsible for limb control have been identified (19) in addition to motor neurons related to bladder control (20), both of which are known to become impaired in NPH.

Increased axial diffusivity in Hydrocephalus patients compared to healthy controls and Alzheimer’s patients implies more diffusion and coherent fiber alignment in the direction parallel to axon orientation, which may mean that NPH causes tracts to be more aligned in regions near the ventricles due to ventricular expansion. Increased diffusion also has the potential to be caused by local edema (21), however the indication that it is measuring fiber coherence is supported by increased FA values provided in Table 2. We also see decreased axial kurtosis in NPH patients, implying a decrease in microstructural complexity and a decrease in barriers to diffusion in the direction parallel to axonal orientation. Evidence suggests that up to a certain point white matter changes in NPH are believed to be reversible, but permanent atrophy of the white matter can develop (22). Decreased Axonal Water Fraction values imply a smaller fraction of axons in each voxel; this means that even though fibers are more tightly aligned in NPH due to ventricular expansion, the packing density of these fibers has decreased. It is important to note that while AWF is significantly decreased in NPH compared to controls, it does not differ from that of Alzheimer’s Disease. This may relate to some of the similarities seen between the two types of dementia or that atrophy in the region of decreased AWF is related to increased ventricular size. Decreased AWF may imply that mechanical pressure on periventricular axons leads to atrophy and permanent damage to the CST or that these fibers may be decreasing in diameter.

Cerebral white matter changes are associated with aging as well as cerebrovascular risk factors and have a high prevalence in patients with hydrocephalus(23). In our previous work(24) we found a strong correlation between the presence of leukoaraiosis and diffusion parameters within ROIs in the internal capsule. Figure 4 quantifies the likelihood of each patient population having leukoaraiosis at any location in the brain. It is possible that mechanical stress on the brain is the cause of both changes observed in diffusion measurements as well as the presence of white matter lesions visible in the brains of diseased patient groups. However, our results indicate an independent NPH effect because even when the analysis is limited to where leukoaraiosis is shared (see Table 2), we still see a significant difference in diffusion and kurtosis values. This suggests that differences in diffusion and kurtosis measures cannot be due to the presence of leukoaraiosis alone.

In the future this study should be expanded to include control populations with ventricles of comparable size to the NPH group. Furthermore, while we hypothesize that ventricular expansion may lead to permanent cell damage in the CST this is only a possible explanation of our findings. This should be explored in follow-up studies examining post-op kurtosis in patients who improve following shunt operations. The small size of the Alzheimer’s disease and healthy control populations potentially limits the reproducibility of this study, future longitudinal analysis of NPH, AD, and HC populations will help provide certainty in the precision of the results presented here.

Conclusion

The along tract analysis performed here provides a unique perspective on the localization of pathology in Hydrocephalus. Examining the brain along its constituent tracts, rather than simply averaging all of the data within them allows for a better understanding of the mechanics of deformations occurring in the brain in Hydrocephalus.

This study demonstrates that Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus can be characterized by decreased axial kurtosis and increased axial diffusivity as well as decreased axonal water fraction in the cortical spinal tract. The findings suggest that these measures can be used as diagnostic markers to help differentiate NPH, AD, and healthy subjects, as reflected by axial kurtosis and diffusivity measures, at a specific periventricular region of the corticospinal tract. Axonal water fraction deficits may reflect microstructural damage; We hope to use these features in isolation and in combination with other distinct features as diagnostic as well as prognostic features of NPH that will help determine patient management in a noninvasive manner.
