pmcThe human genome contains about 20 000 genes encoding protein products. The functional diversity of these protein products is substantially increased through post-translational modifications (PTMs). Some PTMs may be under biological control, whereas others may be products of chance chemistry. Hubbard et al.1 reminded us that less studied modifications, such as amino acid isomerization, may play important biological roles, including in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Thus strategies to identify and quantify protein isomers may be key to understanding disease pathology.

Whereas amino acids may exist in stereoisomeric forms, such as d and l, most naturally occurring amino acids are in l-conformation. Stereoisomers have very similar mass-to-charge ratios and fragmentation patterns, and thus they are challenging to distinguish based on their mass spectra. Other types of peptide isomers, including positional PTMs like phosphorylation, are easier to distinguish from mass spectra because they produce different peptide fragments. Stereoisomers may be distinguished by selective proteolysis, such as by exploiting the ability of the endoprotease Asp-N to selectively cleave aspartyl peptides but not the isoaspartyl counterparts.2 Another approach to distinguishing between peptides with different amino acid stereoisomers is to separate them chromatographically.3

Hubbard et al. used this approach to distinguish stereoisomers based on shifts in their chromatographic retention time while the similarity between their fragment ions supported robust sequence identification. For some peptides, the retention time shift between stereoisomers is large relative to the width of the elution peaks, and thus it allows for confident identification and quantification.3,4 However, as the authors found, not all peptide isomers are well-separated under a given chromatography. Because chromatographic separation is required to distinguish between isomers for identification and quantification, poorly resolved isomer sets could not be confidently analyzed and were thus omitted from interpretation. For the well-resolved isomer sets, the authors further bolstered their confidence by using synthetic peptides to confirm the retention time shifts and fragmentations observed in the previously acquired data. The overall approach is particularly well suited to data acquired by data-independent acquisition (DIA) because it consistently profiles all detectable precursor and fragment ions across all samples regardless of abundance.5 Whereas data-dependent acquisition (DDA) may also support such reanalysis for well-separated and highly abundant peptide isomers, DDA data are likely to be much more limited and result in more missing data. This is because precursors of isomerized peptides may not be subjected to MS2 analysis because of either long exclusion times or insufficient duty cycle time.

Using previously acquired data, Hubbard et al. showed that the fraction of peptides with isomerized Asp387 in the tau protein delineates Alzheimer’s disease (AD) status from controls, including controls with cognitive testing scores similar to AD patients. Additionally, they observed that the fractional isomerization of tau was not positively associated with the abundance of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the patients. As noted by the authors, this observation is inconsistent with the hypothesis that increased isomerization in the tau protein population derives from localizing to NFTs and this being thus inaccessible to degradation.6,7 Indeed, the strong correlations between isomerization and AD suggest that peptide isomerization may be key to understanding Alzheimer’s disease. LC−MS/MS is uniquely powerful in testing this hypothesis with the development of rigorous computational techniques and controls. Furthermore, Hubbard et al. demonstrated that studying protein isomerization does not necessarily require acquiring new LC−MS/MS data because their approach can be applied to previously acquired DIA data. Indeed, if isomerization accumulates with protein age, then it will allow interrogating not just the progression of Alzheimer’s disease but that of other pathologies as well, such as lysosomal storage disease progression. Broad adoption of the approaches of Hubbard et al. may be key to enabling research on such diseases.

The creation of pipelines that automate the study of peptide isomerization will open many opportunities for the detection and analysis of peptide isomers in both newly acquired and existing data sets. Deep learning models might be trained and applied to predict retention time shifts of peptide isomers;8 then, Bayesian statistical frameworks may be developed to assess the confidence of identification.9 Protein isomerization can be analyzed in conjunction with coordinated processes to facilitate biological interpretations. For instance, the covariation between isomerization with other post-translational modifications on a given protein or protein complex may support proteoform inference and suggest hypotheses of biological control.10 Furthermore, the simultaneous quantification of protein turnover rates by pulse-chase experiments may suggest a relationship between the percent isomerization of a given peptide and the protein age. The roles of protein isomerization, be it a product of chance chemistry or under biological control, have yet to be determined. With the adoption of the principles used by Hubbard et al., the role of this PTM in many modalities, from disease to development, can be characterized.
