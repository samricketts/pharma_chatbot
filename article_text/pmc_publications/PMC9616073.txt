Background:

Depressive symptoms are associated with age-related cognitive impairment, but the relative risk of specific subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conferred by depressive symptoms is unclear. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine the longitudinal association between baseline depressive symptoms and incident cases of MCI subtypes (amnestic vs. non-amnestic) and probable dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, vascular, mixed) among postmenopausal women.

Methods:

Depressive symptoms were assessed at study baseline using an 8-item Burnam algorithm in 7,043 postmenopausal women who participated in the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) and the WHIMS-Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) extension study. During the median 9.4-year follow-up interval, the presence of MCI and probable dementia was classified by a central adjudication committee. Classification of participants by MCI subtype (amnestic single and multi-domain, non-amnestic single and multi-domain) was done algorithmically based on established criteria using data from annual cognitive testing.

Results:

At baseline, 557 women (7.9%) had clinically significant depressive symptoms based on Burnam algorithm cut-point of 0.06. Depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident amnestic MCI (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–2.78, p&lt;.0001), but not non-amnestic MCI (HR=1.39, 95% CI 0.91–2.14, p=.13) after controlling for demographic factors. This relationship between depressive symptoms and amnestic MCI remained consistent after controlling for lifestyle variables, cardiovascular risk factors, antidepressant use, and history of hormone therapy. There were no significant associations between depressive symptoms and incidence of probable dementia.

Conclusion:

Depressive symptoms at baseline among postmenopausal older women are associated with higher incidence of amnestic MCI, suggesting that they may be an independent risk factor or part of the early prodrome of dementia.

pmcIntroduction

Clinically significant depressive symptoms are common in older adulthood. Reported prevalence of major depressive disorder in adults over age 65 ranges from 1% to 5% 1, while an estimated 7% to 49% of older adults have clinically relevant depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a depressive disorder 2. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have found a relationship between depressive symptoms and age-related cognitive impairment, although the causal nature of the relationship continues to be debated. Subclinical and syndromal late-life depression may be considered a prodrome of Alzheimer’s disease by some3,4, while others consider depressive symptoms an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment 5,6.

Many studies exploring the relationship between depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment have used diagnoses of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or all-cause dementia as primary outcomes. However, MCI and dementia diagnoses represent heterogeneous subtypes with distinct etiological features and cognitive profiles. MCI diagnoses are often divided into two subtypes based on profiles of cognitive performance: amnestic (impairment in memory alone or in addition to other cognitive domains) and non-amnestic (single- and multi-domain but no memory impairment) 7,8. The most prevalent subtypes of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), affecting 13.9% of Americans, and vascular dementia, with a prevalence of 2.4% 9. The relationship between MCI subtypes and conversion to dementia is complex, as some patients with MCI show cognitive stability or revert to normal cognition 10. Amnestic MCI is often considered a prodrome of AD, while non-amnestic MCI may signal higher risk for non-AD dementias 11.

A meta-analysis has shown that late-life depression is associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia, including vascular dementia and AD 12. This is consistent with evidence that cerebrovascular disease may contribute to the development or perpetuation of depression in later life, known as the “vascular depression” hypothesis 13,14. Newer evidence also implicates depression in later life as an important risk factor for AD 5,15,16. Better understanding of the relationship between depressive symptoms and subtypes of MCI may help clarify whether depression is a significant risk factor for prodromal AD versus non-AD dementias and suggest different underlying biological mechanisms. This question is particularly important for women’s health, as the prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms is twice as high in women as in men 17 and women are at higher risk for AD 18. The menopause transition is an especially salient factor, as perimenopausal women are at 2.5 times greater risk of depressive symptoms compared to pre-menopause19. Risk declines during the postmenopausal state, though late-life depressive symptoms remain common, affect around 25% of women,20 and are associated with cognitive impairment.21 In 2016, the International Menopause Society produced recommendations stating that while short-term estrogen therapy may improve affective symptoms during the menopausal transition, findings are inconsistent as to whether hormone therapy improves or has no effect on depressive symptoms in postmenopausal women.22

The Women’s Health Initiative Hormone Trials (WHI-HT), were two randomized controlled trials evaluating the risks and benefits of hormone therapy (estrogen alone versus placebo and estrogen plus progesterone versus placebo) in healthy postmenopausal women, and also assessed depressive symptoms at baseline. An ancillary study, the WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) began in 1995 and was designed to examine the effects of hormone therapy on incident mild cognitive impairment and dementia in 7,479 WHI-HT participants aged 65 or older. Within WHIMS, MCI and probable dementia were adjudicated by a central panel of experts following standardized criteria. Upon conclusion of the WHIMS observational extension study in 2008, a subset of women participated in WHIMS-Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcommes (WHIMS-ECHO), which included annual cognitive evaluation and central adjudication of MCI and probable dementia; this study ended in 2021.

In the WHIMS, pooled results from the estrogen-alone and estrogen plus progestin trials showed that hormone therapy increased incidence of MCI and dementia, a finding that is possible attributable to timing of hormone therapy in the late postmenopausal period.23 The prevalence and associated characteristics of amnestic and non-amnestic MCI have been previously characterized in the WHIMS study24, and an association between elevated depressive symptoms and incident cognitive decline was reported in WHIMS 25. Neither study, however, explored the relative risk of specific subtypes of MCI conferred by depressive symptoms. In this exploratory study, we sought to examine prospectively whether clinically significant depressive symptoms are differentially associated with subtypes of MCI and dementia in postmenopausal women.

Methods

Participants

WHIMS enrolled 7,479 community-dwelling, postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years who did not have a diagnosis of dementia at baseline. The study design, protocol, and primary results have been reported elsewhere 26,27. The WHIMS intervention periods were 1995 to 2002 for the estrogen+progestin trial, and 1995 through 2004 for the estrogen-alone trial. An observational extension study including 5,835 WHIMS participants continued until 2007. A subset of 2,922 women from WHIMS extension was recruited for the WHIMS-ECHO study in 2008, which included further follow-up of cognitive status through an annual administration of a validated cognitive telephone cognitive assessment 28 and continued central adjudication of MCI and dementia. Study protocols were approved by institutional review boards of all participating sites and the National Institutes of Health. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Of the 7,479 women in WHIMS, 173 participants were diagnosed with MCI or probable dementia within 6 months of study baseline and were excluded from this study. Another 263 were missing study measures and were excluded from analysis. This left 7,043 (95%) women with complete data who were included in the study (see CONSORT diagram, Figure 1).

Key Variables

Depressive Symptoms.

Depressive symptoms were measured at study baseline in 1995 with a self-report instrument consisting of the six-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale CES-D; 29 and two items from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule DIS; 30. The Burnam algorithm, a logistic regression algorithm originally developed for the Medical Outcomes Study 31 was used to derive a composite score between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomatology. A Burnam cut-point of 0.06 has strong sensitivity for detecting clinically significant depressive symptoms in primary care samples 31.

Mild Cognitive Impairment and Dementia Subtypes.

The WHIMS protocol for detecting MCI and probable dementia has been previously published 26,27. Briefly, the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) examination was administered by centrally trained and certified examiners at 39 study sites to all participants at baseline and annual follow-up visits through 2008 (when the telephone battery was initiated). For women who scored below a prespecified cut-point on the 3MS, the examiner administered the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological battery and proxy interviews 32 plus a standardized interview to assess for psychiatric disorders. These participants were evaluated by a local physician who had experience diagnosing cognitive impairment including dementia following a standardized protocol. Physicians had the option to order a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) brain scan and/or laboratory blood tests to rule out reversible causes of cognitive dysfunction. Lastly, all the information was transmitted for a review and central adjudication at the WHIMS Coordinating Center, Wake Forest School of Medicine by three specialists who classified participants as having normal cognition, MCI or probable dementia according to standardized diagnostic criteria: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV) for dementia and Petersen criteria for MCI 7.

At the beginning of WHIMS-ECHO in 2008, enrolled participants (N=2,841) received annual cognitive assessments by telephone and the same adjudication process continued. All cognitive assessments were performed by centrally trained and certified examiners. The neuropsychological battery included the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICSm) 33, East Boston Memory Test 34, Category Fluency (Animals) 35, Digit Span-Backward 36, and Oral Trail Making Test 37, plus a sleep questionnaire and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale 38. This battery has been validated for telephone administration and demonstrated to be equivalent to face-to-face administration 28. The annual cognitive assessment also included administration of the Dementia Questionnaire (DQ), a structured interview of a knowledgeable proxy with questions about the participant’s cognitive, behavioral, and medical status 39. All the data from these annual visits were submitted to central adjudication as described above.

For this analysis, we used the data from participants who were adjudicated as having MCI to algorithmically define an MCI subtype for each participant. MCI classification was based on the following four criteria: 1) objective cognitive deficits, defined as at least one score greater than 1.5 standard deviation units below the mean on CERAD subtests of episodic memory (Word List Delayed Recall or Constructional Praxis Recall), verbal fluency (Category Fluency), language (Boston Naming Test-15 item), visuo-construction (Constructional Praxis), processing speed (Trail Making Test, Part A), and executive functioning (Trail Making Test, Part B); 2) observed cognitive problems, as reported by proxy informant; 3) absence of significant impairment in activities of daily living attributable to cognition; and 4) absence of dementia.

Due to the change in the cognitive measures collected for WHIMS-ECHO, the four criteria to classify participants into MCI subtypes were 1) objective cognitive deficits, defined by at least one test score 1.5 standard deviation units below the mean on a measure of memory (East Boston Memory delayed recall), verbal fluency (Category Fluency), attention (Digit Span), or executive functioning (Oral Trail Making Test, Part B); 2) observed cognitive problems reported by proxy on DQ (i.e., problems with “memory,” “remembering people’s names,” “recognizing familiar faces,” “finding way about indoors,” “finding way on familiar streets,” “remembering a short list of items”); 3) absence of impairment in activities of daily living attributable to cognition, defined as a response of “no,” “don’t know,” or “not applicable” to questions 14–20 of the DQ (“trouble with household tasks,” “trouble handling money,” “trouble grasping situations or explanations,” “difficulty at work,” “trouble dressing or caring for self, including choosing clothes and tying shoes,” “trouble feeding self, including cutting meat and buttering bread,” “trouble controlling bladder or bowels”; and 4) absence of dementia.

Based on the participants’ individual cognitive test scores outlined above, participants were then placed into one of four MCI subtypes: amnestic single domain (deficit on a memory measure and no other tests), non-amnestic single domain (deficit on a non-memory measure and no memory deficit), amnestic multiple domain (deficit on a memory measure and at least one other domain), and non-amnestic multiple domain (deficit on two or more domains other than memory) 8. During WHIMS and the WHIMS extension, central adjudication included determination of the most probable etiology of dementia (e.g., AD, Vascular, Mixed); however, this subclassification of dementia ceased in 2008 due to insufficient information (no CT, blood, clinical evaluation). Thus, data regarding dementia subtypes are limited and are presented here as a secondary analysis.

Other Relevant Covariates.

Demographic information, medical history, and lifestyle variables were obtained by clinical measurements and self-report, as described elsewhere40. Relevant covariates were selected due to their association with depressive symptomology. These included age, self-reported race/ethnicity (White [Not Hispanic], Black, and “Other or Unknown, which includes Hispanic [2.2%], American Indian/Alaska Native [0.3%], and Asian or Pacific Islander [1.7%] individuals), education, income, marital status (never married, separated or divorced, widowed, currently married), MMSE score, current antidepressant use (yes/no), alcohol use (current, past, never), smoking (current, past, never), body mass index (BMI; weight [kg]/height2 [m2]), frequency of exercise (0, &lt;2, 2–3, ≥4 times per week), hypertension treatment (no hypertension, untreated, treated), self-reported history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or stroke (yes/no), prior hormone therapy (yes/no), and WHI treatment assignment (whether women were randomized to the intervention arm [estrogen-alone, estrogen+progestin] or the control group [matching placebo] in the respective studies. These covariates were consistent with those used by Goveas and colleagues 25 to permit comparison with their analyses.

Statistical Analyses

Participants were stratified into two groups, presence or absence of clinically significant depressive symptoms, based on their Burnam depression score at enrollment in WHIMS (Burnam algorithm cut-point = .06). Baseline characteristics were compared using chi-square test for categorical variables and general linear models for continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between categorical measures of depressive symptoms and incidence of mild cognitive impairment with the following adjustments: Model 1: depressive symptoms, age, race, education, family income, and marital status; Model 2: all variables in model 2 as well as lifestyle variables (alcohol, smoking, exercise status) and health variables (antidepressant use, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, stroke, prior hormone therapy, WHI treatment arm). Separate models were constructed for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), probable dementia (PD), and any cognitive impairment (a composite outcome of first MCI or PD). Proportional hazard assumptions were assessed through graphics and by testing whether there was a significant time-dependent covariate for the Burnam cut-point; assumptions held for all three outcomes. Additionally, separate models were fitted for the four subtypes of incident MCI: single domain amnestic (aMCI-SD), single domain non-amnestic (naMCI-SD), multi domain amnestic (aMCI-MD), and multi domain non amnestic (naMCI-MD), and the three subtypes of probable dementia: Alzheimer’s, Vascular, and Mixed. Interaction tests were performed for any significant interactions with age, race, exercise, smoking status, hypertension, BMI, and APOE status. Within the analyses for overall MCI, we additionally performed a test of interaction on amnestic vs. non-amnestic classes of MCI. For those with on-study cognitive impairment, follow-up time was censored at the date of the cognitive testing that triggered its adjudication. For those without on-study MCI or probable dementia, follow-up was censored at the participant’s last cognitive assessment. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant and no adjustments were made for multiple testing.

Results

Of the 7,043 women included in the present analyses, 557 (7.9%) met criteria for clinically significant depressive symptoms based on the Burnam score cut-point at baseline (Table 1). Women with clinically significant depressive symptoms were more likely to be Black; widowed, separated, or divorced; live in the Northeast or South; report lower educational attainment and income; have lower baseline 3MS scores; be currently taking an antidepressant medication; have a history of alcohol use; have current history of smoking; be sedentary; report prior hormone therapy; and have multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease). Women in the WHI E+P trial were more likely to have depressive symptoms than those in the E-alone trial, regardless of treatment or placebo conditions. Given the long follow-up interval (maximum of 23 years), a large number of observations were censored due to death (N=1,484; 21.1%) or women being lost to follow-up (N=4,149; 58.9%). Of those lost to follow-up, 86% had at least five years of follow-up data included in the present analyses.

During the follow-up interval (median = 9.4 years; IQR = 6.1–15.4; range 0.5 – 23.4), 862 women (12.2%) developed MCI and 848 (12.0%) developed probable dementia. Of the 862 women with MCI, 30 (3.5%) were classified as aMCI-SD, 129 (15.0%) as naMCI-SD, 192 (22.3%) as aMCI-MD, and 101 (11.7%) as naMCI-MD. Of the remaining 410 women, 247 (60.2%) did not fully meet criteria for any MCI subtype (40 did not meet criteria from the original WHIMS study period, 48 did not have observed cognitive problems reported by proxy on the DQ, 132 did not have a cognitive test score &lt;1.5 standard deviations below the mean, and 27 did not meet the absence of impairment in activities of daily living criteria). Another 163 (39.8%) had missing data (incomplete DQ). Of the 848 women with probable dementia, 378 (44.6%) women were evaluated for a probable etiology; 106 (28.0%) were classified as probable AD, 39 (10.3%) as probable Vascular dementia, 27 (7.1%) as Mixed type dementia, 24 (6.3%) as other dementia etiology, 127 (33.6%) as etiology unknown, and 55 (14.6%) were not reviewed for specific etiology due to not having sufficient information about the case.

Analyses of joint outcomes irrespective of MCI or probable dementia subtype showed that having clinically significant depressive symptoms was associated with higher risk of incident MCI (Model 1: HR=1.51, 95% CI 1.21–1.88, p&lt;.0001; Model 2 (fully adjusted): HR=1.39, 95% CI 1.10–1.76, p=.006), probable dementia (Model 1: HR=1.47, 95% CI 1.17–1.84, p=.001; Model 2: HR=1.45, 95% CI 1.14–1.84, p=.003), and any cognitive impairment (Model 1: HR=1.51, 95% CI 1.27–1.79, p&lt;.0001; Model 2: HR=1.42, 95% CI 1.18–1.71, p=.0002) (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the associations between depressive symptoms and amnestic (combined single and multi-domain) and non-amnestic (combined single and multi-domain) MCI. After adjusting for demographic characteristics (Model 1), depressive symptoms were associated with higher risk of amnestic MCI (HR=1.91, 95% CI 1.32–2.78, p&lt;.0001), while there was no significant relationship with non-amnestic MCI (HR=1.39, 95% CI 0.91–2.14, p=.13). In the fully adjusted model, the relationship between depression and cognitive impairment persisted for amnestic MCI.

Exploratory analyses examined the association between baseline depressive symptoms and four subtypes of MCI (aMCI-SD, aMCI-MD, naMCI-SD, naMCI-MD) as well as etiology of dementia (Alzheimer’s disease, vascular, mixed). Regarding MCI subtypes (Table 4), having clinically significant depressive symptoms at study entry was associated with higher risk of naMCI-SD (HR=1.83, 95% CI=1.08–3.12, p=.03) and aMCI-MD (HR=1.88, 95% CI=1.26–2.80, p=.002) in Model 1. The effect for naMCI-SD was no longer significant after full adjustment for all relevant covariates including cardiovascular risk factors, WHI treatment assignment, 3MS at baseline, and antidepressant therapy (fully adjusted model: HR=1.51, 95% CI=0.85–2.71, p=.16). The effect for aMCI-MD was significant after adjustment for all relevant covariates (HR=1.79, 95% CI 1.16–2.74, p=.008). There was no significant association between depressive symptoms and subtypes of incident probable dementia in unadjusted or adjusted models (all p’s&gt;.2 in unadjusted models; Table 5).

Tests of interaction were performed for all significant associations described above to determine whether they varied by age, race, cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., exercise, smoking, treatment for hypertension, BMI), or APOE genotype. None of these tests of interaction were significant (all p’s &gt; .05).

Discussion

Having clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline was associated with higher risk of incident MCI and probable dementia over a medan follow-up interval of 9.4 years in this cohort of older, post-menopausal women. Analysis of MCI subtypes showed that depressive symptoms were associated with approximately 1.8 times the hazard for developing amnestic MCI, often considered an AD prodrome, after adjusting for potential confounding variables including prior hormone therapy and WHIMS treatment arm. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms and risk of MCI subtypes in a large cohort of post-menopausal women.

Our finding that depressive symptoms were associated with higher risk of incident MCI and probable dementia (independent of subtype) replicates the prior work of Goveas and colleagues25 in the WHIMS cohort, though with nearly twice the duration of follow-up. The complex relationship between depressive symptoms and incident cognitive impairment has been an active area of research in recent years. Some studies suggest that subclinical and syndromal late-life depression are independent risk factors for AD 5,15,41, while others suggest that depression may be more closely related to vascular dementia 12,42 or just a part of the AD prodrome 16,43, though these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.

Large prospective studies, such as WHIMS, can help disentangle these relationships. Investigating subtypes of MCI is one method of examining the association between depressive symptomatology and cognitive impairment. Although individual cognitive trajectories vary, the distinction between amnestic and non-amnestic MCI subtypes has diagnostic and prognostic utility. Patients with amnestic MCI show a more precipitous course of cognitive decline than those with non-amnestic MCI44. Amnestic MCI is also associated with greater medial temporal lobe atrophy45, medial temporal lobe hypometabolism 46, and greater beta-amyloid deposition on amyloid PET47. There is some controversy over the diagnostic stability and validity of the single- versus multi-domain MCI distinction, as single domain impaired individuals have a high rate of reversion to cognitive normality,48 and the present study was limited by low case counts for the aMCI-SD subtype. However, longitudinal studies consistently demonstrate that amnestic MCI is associated with a higher risk of progression to Alzheimer’s type dementia compared to non-amnestic MCI49. Thus, our finding that women with depressive symptoms at baseline are at greater risk for amnestic than non-amnestic MCI suggests that depressive symptoms may be a greater risk factor for Alzheimer’s type dementia versus non-Alzheimer’s etiologies of cognitive impairment. Our findings are also congruent with the hypothesis that depressive symptoms may emerge as a part of an early neuropsychiatric prodrome of AD 50.

The mechanisms linking depressive symptoms to AD and other causes of age-related cognitive impairment are complex and likely multifactorial. Depressed mood is associated with neuroendocrine changes, including disruption to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that causes chronic elevation of adrenal glucocorticoid levels. HPA axis dysregulation with hypercortisolemia may contribute to a variety of pathological processes that increase risk for cognitive decline, including metabolic syndrome, disrupted endothelial functioning, elevated cytokine levels, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress 51. Each of these processes has also been linked to risk for AD 52 and elevated glucocorticoid levels have been directly associated with AD neuropathology, both amyloid and tau 53. Depressed mood may also affect engagement in positive lifestyle behaviors (e.g., exercise, healthy diet) that impact risk of AD 54. Although the present study cannot disentangle the potential causal mechanisms, our finding of an association between depressive symptoms and amnestic MCI is consistent with evidence linking elevated glucocorticoid levels to downstream effects on medial temporal lobe systems supporting memory through these biological processes 55. Future studies are needed to elucidate these causal mechanisms and to determine whether treatment of depressive symptoms may reduce progression of AD.

This study is not without limitations. We relied on slightly different operational criteria for determining MCI subtypes for years in which women were in the WHIMS versus WHIMS-ECHO extension study. Different neuropsychological testing batteries were used between these studies, as well. This may have led to differences in the incidence rates of amnestic versus non-amnestic MCI across studies. We were also limited by the low incidence of certain MCI subtypes, particularly aMCI-SD, which limited statistical power. Thus, our analyses breaking amnestic and non-amnestic MCI into single and multi-domain categories should be considered exploratory and used to guide future confirmatory studies. Another limitation was the fact that adjudication of probable dementia etiology (e.g., AD, vascular, mixed) stopped in November of 2008, limiting the number of events within each etiologic category. There was also a large range of follow-up interval (0.5 to 23.4 years) because many observations were censored due to death (21%) or being lost to follow-up (59%), though this weakness is offset by the fact that 86% had at least five years of follow-up data. Another limitation was that self-report measures were used to determine the presence of vascular risk factors and other aspects of medical history, which may have led to inaccurate characterization of these important covariates. Additionally, presence of clinically significant depressive symptoms was based on the Burnam algorithm rather than a gold standard such as a standardized interview. The Burnam screen has a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 87% for current major depression and dysthymia compared to clinician diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), but its positive predictive power is low (20%)56. Finally, we were unable to distinguish between women with late-onset depressive symptoms and those with recurrent depression over the life course. The mechanisms underlying late-onset versus recurrent depressive symptoms may be distinct and confer unique risk for Alzheimer’s disease versus other causes of cognitive impairment. Replication of findings using structured clinical interviews to establish presence of depressive disorder and more detailed assessment of lifetime depressive symptoms will be an important area for future research. An important strength of this study is the long duration of follow-up in a well-characterized cohort of post-menopausal women.

In summary, we found that among post-menopausal women, having clinically significant depressive symptoms at baseline nearly doubled the risk of developing amnestic MCI over a median 9.4 years of follow-up. This suggests that adequate treatment of late-life depression may be an important aspect of prevention of cognitive impairment in older women.
