INTRODUCTION:

We evaluated whether hospitalization with or without surgery increases risk for dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.

METHODS:

A clinical sample (843 clinically-diagnosed dementia cases; 1,686 matched non-demented individuals) was identified from Swedish Twin Registry (STR) studies. A register-based sample (4,293 cases; 21,465 matched controls) was identified by linkage of STR to Swedish Patient Registry records. APOE status and within-pair comparisons of dementia discordant twins indicated genetic susceptibility.

RESULTS:

Non-surgical hospitalization is associated with greater dementia risk than hospitalization with surgical intervention. In the register sample, thoracic, abdominal, and major orthopaedic procedures entailed dementia risk; in the clinical sample, orthopaedic alone. Within-pair analyses indicate that associations in part reflect genetic susceptibility in common to hospitalization and dementia. Potential gene-environment interactions were indicated by greater risk due to hospitalization among APOEe4 non-carriers.

DISCUSSION:

We confirm hospitalization as a risk factor for dementia, with repeated hospitalizations a more important risk factor than surgery.

1. Introduction

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that hospitalization due to severe illness accelerates cognitive decline or even mediates a permanent change in cognition that ultimately may lead to dementia.[1–3] While studies among non-surgical patient populations have identified hospitalization as a prominent risk factor for later dementia,[1, 2] there are more controversial and disparate findings within surgical patient populations[4–6].

It is increasingly recognized that exposure to surgery is associated with transient postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) typically seen as a reduction in memory, learning and attention lasting for weeks or months after an otherwise uneventful elective or acute procedure.[7–9] The risk for further cognitive decline is more pronounced among elderly patients and those with pre-existing cognitive impairment.[10, 11] Recent attempts to determine whether patients with POCD also have an increased risk for a permanent reduction in cognitive capacity or later dementia compared to surgical patients without postoperative dysfunction have so far failed to identify such an association.[4, 6] Similarly, there are inconsistent data as to whether there is an enhanced risk for dementia (e.g. Alzheimer disease) after exposure to surgery per se, or even to anaesthetic agents[6, 12, 13] unrelated to development of postoperative cognitive improvement or impairment. A nation-wide register study indicated an increased risk for dementia after anaesthesia and surgery,[5] while nested case-control and prospective studies refuted any association between the surgical procedure and later dementia.[4, 6] There are a number of challenges in assessing the risk for dementia subsequent to surgical or non-surgical hospitalization, including having information on history of hospitalizations, sufficient follow-up time to determine the long-term effect of hospitalization, and consideration of the role of genetic susceptibility. Nevertheless, patients, their relatives and health care workers urgently await information as to whether surgery per se should be considered a risk factor for later dementia.

In an attempt to overcome some of these challenges, we undertook a nested case-control study based on a well-characterized cohort of 60,172 twins from the population-based Swedish Twin Registry with follow-up for dementia diagnoses up to 38 years, combined with information on hospitalization from national healthcare registries. The objective was to evaluate whether hospitalization with or without surgery is a risk factor for subsequent dementia or Alzheimer disease. We also evaluated the risks in a large sample of twin pairs discordant for dementia (i.e. one twin affected, the other not yet affected) where within-pair “co-twin control” analyses allow assessment of dementia risk while controlling for genetic reasons for dementia and hospitalization. The role of genetic susceptibility was also assessed through APOE status.

2. Method

2.1. Study population and setting

The Swedish Twin Register (STR) is a population-based register including information on essentially all 200,000 twins born in Sweden since 1886.[14] For this study, two separate cohorts were created: Clinical and Register-based (Appendix Figure 1). The Clinical cohort included 14,010 twins with telephone screening and in-person testing of cognitive function and clinical dementia evaluation from four studies conducted within the STR: The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging,[15] Origins of Variance in the Oldest Old: Octogenarian Twins,[16] Aging in Women and Men,[17] and the Study of Dementia in Swedish Twins.[18] These studies are described further in the appendix.

A nested case-control sample was drawn from the clinical cohort (n=14,010), by selecting the first dementia case in a twin pair (n=843) together with two unrelated controls (n=1,686) alive at time of diagnosis and matched on sex and birth year (± 2 years).

The Register-based cohort was derived by selecting all twins from the STR alive, with no registered dementia diagnosis and below 65 years of age in 1977 (n=60,172). A nested case-control sample with 4,293 dementia cases ascertained as described below and 5 matched (on birth year and sex and alive at time of diagnosis and no record of emigration) controls per case (n=21,465) was created. Dementia cases in the clinical cohort were not excluded from the registry-based cohort; 380 individuals were in both samples.

2.2. Information from population registers

By means of the unique personal identification number assigned to each Swedish resident, STR was linked to the National Patient Register (NPR), the Cause of Death Register (CDR), and the Prescribed Drug Register (PDR) to obtain information on hospitalizations and dementia diagnoses (appendix). The NPR contains information on in- and out-patient (specialist clinic) visits with admission and discharge dates, main and secondary discharge diagnoses and medical procedures. The CDR has information on underlying and contributing causes of death. The Prescribed Drug Register has information on prescriptions filled in Sweden. Linkages were based on most recent version available, i.e. with all registrations in NPR and CDR through December 31, 2014 and in PDR through April 30, 2015.

2.3. Dementia diagnoses

In the clinical cohort, dementia was ascertained through a complete clinical workup followed by a multi-professional team consensus diagnosis according to criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (version III-R or IV) dependent on year of diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer disease (AD) followed NINCDS/ADRDA criteria. Age of onset was established through an informant in combination with medical records and longitudinal cognitive test information.

In the register-based cohort, information on dementia was retrieved from hospitalization diagnoses in the NPR, causes of death in the CDR, and the PDR (diagnosis/drug classification codes given in appendix). Time of disease onset was estimated as 3 years prior to the first registered diagnosis in the NPR[19], 5 years prior to death, if ascertained in the CDR, and at the same age as first relevant prescription in the PDR.

2.4. Exposures

Information on hospitalizations was retrieved from the NPR. We considered any hospitalization requiring an overnight stay, except those with psychiatric primary diagnosis (appendix), from Jan. 01, 1977 until time of onset of dementia or the corresponding date for matched controls. Thus, hospitalizations occurring after the onset of dementia were not considered an exposure.

Surgical hospitalization was defined as a hospitalization with a surgical medical procedure coded according to the Swedish Classification of Operations and Major Procedures in the NPR (appendix Table1). Among surgical procedures associated with hospitalizations, we identified three commonly performed sub-types of special interest: thoracic, major abdominal (including gynecological/urological but excluding biopsies) and major orthopaedic (hip and knee arthroplasty, osteosynthesis of pelvis and osteotomies of hip and knee). Procedures due to proximal femur fractures were evaluated separately. Non-surgical hospitalization was defined as any hospitalization not classified as a surgical hospitalization and not within 6 months from a surgical hospitalization. Critical illness was defined as hospitalization requiring intensive care as described previously.[1]

2.5. APOE genotyping

APOE genotypes were available from most members of the clinical cohort. Presence of e4 included genotypes 34 or 44. Individuals with genotype 24 were excluded. For analyses, cases were matched to one control with APOE genotyping, selected in the same manner as in the larger clinical cohort.

2.6. Education

Education was retrieved from questionnaires to all twins at the time of compilation of each of the cohorts of the Swedish Twin Registry. If the information was missing, register data from Statistics Sweden was used.

2.7. Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). To evaluate the extent to which surgical and non-surgical hospitalization are risk factors for dementia or AD, we used conditional logistic regression to derive odds ratios and 95% 2-sided confidence intervals (CIs), which are estimates of hazard ratios (HRs) since density sampling of controls was used.[20] Analyses were performed for both any dementia and AD as outcome measures, and in both the clinical and the register-based sample. All models were adjusted for sex, birth year and follow-up time through matching, with additional models adjusted for education. Education was the only covariate with missing values, and it was rare (&lt; 0.7%). We therefore based each analysis on all available participants. Trends were tested by modelling the ordinal exposure variables as linear numerical explanatory variables. Individuals who had undergone cerebral surgery exited the cohort on the date of the surgery. To test for the presence of gene-environment interaction, main exposures were also tested for interaction with APOE e4.

In order to adjust for genetic factors, we also performed conditional logistic regression with twin pairs as strata, based on all pairs with known zygosity where the co-twin was still alive at the time the first case in the pair was diagnosed (155 monozygotic (MZ) and 370 dizygotic (DZ) pairs in the clinical cohort, 543 MZ and 1,740 DZ pairs in the register-based cohort). Separate estimates were computed for MZ and DZ pairs along with interaction tests for exposure and zygosity. An attenuation of the point estimates in MZ pairs relative to estimates in DZ pairs indicates confounding by genetic factors. A potential gene–environment interaction was evaluate d by testing whether hazard ratios differed in exposure discordant MZ pairs as a function of APOE e4 carrier status.

3. Results

Characteristics of the nested case-control and co-twin control samples for each of the cohorts are shown in appendix Table 2. Mean age at start of follow-up was higher in the clinical sample than in the register-based sample. The clinical sample also had a slightly shorter follow-up time, while the age at onset of dementia was similar in the two samples.

Hospitalization was associated with an increased incidence of dementia in both the clinical (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36–2.04) and register-based samples (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.69–2.01; Table 1). Risk was elevated in patients who had been hospitalized for non-surgical reasons as well as for those hospitalized due to critical illness (in the register sample). There was an increased risk for dementia in the register-based sample for all three types of surgery and femur fracture procedures, but only for orthopaedic surgery and femur fractures in the clinical sample. There was also an increased risk in those with complications due to surgery and/or anaesthesia.

Analyses restricted to risk for AD resulted in attenuated findings in the clinical sample, but generally paralleled those for any dementia in the register-based sample.

Further analyses explored risk associated with number of hospitalizations, as well as age at hospitalization and time since hospitalization. Risk of dementia increased with increasing number of non-surgical hospitalizations (Figure 1). In general, associations were stable across age group at hospitalization (Figure 2, left panel), except for a lack of risk associated with any surgical operation in the register-based sample after age 80.

In order to evaluate when the effects of hospitalization become apparent, we estimated the risks for three intervals of time since hospitalization: &lt;1 year, 1–4.9 years, and 5–20 years (Figure 2, right panel). In the clinical sample, risk of dementia was elevated in the first five years after non-surgical hospitalization but decreased after 5 years post hospitalization. In the register-based sample, risks were apparent at all intervals after non-surgical hospitalization, but only became apparent at least 1 year after surgical hospitalization.

In sensitivity analyses of surgical hospitalizations, we further evaluated risk of dementia due to surgery as a function of age at surgery and time since surgery (appendix Table3). In the clinical sample, orthopaedic surgery after the age of 70 was associated with a greater risk and the risk became apparent five years after surgery. In the register-based sample, risk estimates were greater for thoracic and abdominal surgery before 70 years of age, but greater after age 70 for orthopaedic surgery. Notably, dementia risk after all three types of surgery became apparent only 5–20 years post hospitalization.

Finally, we tested the role of genetic susceptibility on the associations by two analyses. Co-twin control (within-pair) analyses, in which affected twins are compared to their unaffected co-twin, allow inferences about the robustness of an association after controlling for familial factors (in DZ pairs) and genetic susceptibility (in MZ pairs) (Table 2). Risk of dementia as a function of both non-surgical and surgical hospitalization was significant within DZ pairs, indicating that risks remain after controlling for familial factors for dementia and hospitalization. Risk estimates for MZ pairs were lower and did not reach significance, suggesting that the findings in the general population, and those in DZ pairs, are in part confounded by genetic factors. Similar patterns of attenuated risk in MZs were evident for number of hospitalizations (Figure 3).

We examined a possible gene–environment interaction by testing the interaction with APOE4. APOE e4 carriers were less susceptible to the effects of non-surgical hospitalization (appendix Table4). In dementia discordant MZ pairs, there was a tendency to stronger associations for non-carrier pairs (appendix Table5). These results provide further evidence of an interaction between genetic susceptibility and hospitalization on the risk for dementia and AD.

4. Discussion

In this large and nation-wide, population-based nested case-control study, with nearly 850 clinically ascertained cases, and over 4,000 healthcare registry-based cases, we found that hospitalizations due to non-surgical reasons or critical illness are associated with a higher risk for dementia as opposed to hospitalizations due to surgical procedures. The risks increased with increasing number of non-surgical hospitalizations and for all ages at non-surgical hospitalization, whereas the risks associated with surgical hospitalization became apparent only 5–20 years post hospitalization. Major orthopaedic surgery after 70 years of age was associated with an increased risk for dementia. Thoracic and abdominal surgery before but not after 70 years of age was associated with an increased risk for dementia, likely reflecting selection bias for surgery on cognitively healthy patients at advanced ages.

Within twin pair comparisons showed that the effects were consistently smaller in MZ than DZ pairs. This attenuation of effects indicates that genetic susceptibility explains part of the association between hospitalization, surgical or non-surgical, and dementia. Similarly, a recent Danish twin study found no difference in the cognitive scores of twins in pairs discordant for major surgery and conclude that the underlying disease is more important than surgery for subsequent cognitive impairment.[21] Furthermore, we found risks for dementia following non-surgical hospitalizations were greater in non-carriers of the APOE e4 allele and in discordant MZ pairs who were APOE e4 non-carriers, indicating gene-environment interaction. In other words, non-surgical hospitalization is associated with risk for dementia only in those not already at risk due to carrying APOE e4. Thus, genetic influences for both dementia and the reasons for hospitalization play an important role in risk for dementia. Unlike Schenning et al.[22], we found no interaction with APOE in relation to undergoing surgery.

While data suggest that patients undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia are at risk for postoperative impairment of cognitive function[8, 23] or cognitive decline[11, 22], there are conflicting results from recent studies on risk for dementia after anaesthesia and surgery. Although Sprung et al.[4] were unable to find such association in medical record reviews of a nested case-control study and Aiello Bowles et al.[6] found no association with self-reported anaesthesia and dementia, Chen et al.[5] found an increased risk after in-hospital surgical care using a nation-wide registry. The present study was powered to detect increased risk for dementia following either non-surgical or surgical hospitalizations and furthermore identify risk for dementia after in-hospital care due to critical illness, or for medical or surgical reasons. We found only modest evidence for dementia risk after surgery.

The lack of conclusive evidence regarding risk of cognitive impairment or dementia subsequent to cardiac surgery[7, 12, 24] led us to perform a post-hoc analysis of dementia risk for thoracic, major abdominal and orthopaedic surgery. This analysis revealed that orthopaedic surgery showed a consistent dementia risk after age 70 whereas thoracic and major abdominal surgery conferred a risk only when the surgery was before age 70. For all three types of surgery, risk for dementia was apparent only in the 5–20 year follow-up interval. This indicates that there is less likelihood that the surgery was precipitated by a prodromal dementia or that there was a surveillance bias.

Although we were not able to assess mechanisms by which surgery could lead to dementia, some insights may be gained from studies of surgery-induced neuroinflammation[25] since neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease are thought to be associated with neuroinflammation.[26] While surgery and trauma trigger the innate immune system via damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and alarmins to launch an inflammatory response necessary to restore homeostasis and promote healing, surgery also leads to immune activation within the brain,[27] potentially triggering cognitive decline.[28–30] Cytokines and peripheral immune competent cells have a pivotal role in this process within the central nervous system, as demonstrated in experimental models of abdominal[29] and orthopaedic surgery.[30] Hence, it may be argued that the systemic inflammatory response to surgery once transferred through cellular and humoral pathways to the brain, in individuals susceptible to unresolved changes in brain immune system, may be associated persistent immune activation ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and dementia.

The association between non-surgical hospitalizations and dementia may arise because some of the underlying reasons for the hospitalization are also risk factors for dementia, e.g., heart failure, infections and inflammatory syndromes. In other words, the reasons for the non-surgical hospitalizations are also likely to be responsible at least in part for the dementia. Moreover, individuals who are beginning to suffer cognitive loss may be less able to manage their own medical regimes, which in turn might occasion more hospitalizations.[2] However, Ehlenbach et al.[1] found critical illness hospitalizations were associated with cognitive decline beyond baseline cognitive status.

The present study offers several advantages. The cohort from which the nested case-control samples were drawn was population-based and large, and follow-up time (up to 38 years) considerably longer than the 5 years typically reported. The information about hospitalization and surgery is from mandatory national registries and is prospective rather than being recalled. The clinically assessed sample does not suffer from ascertainment bias, as dementia diagnoses were based on longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the impact of potentially important confounders could be assessed, i.e., genetic propensity to dementia or hospitalization, and APOE4 carrier status. Potential cohort and period effects affecting dementia diagnosis and detection were removed by the matching procedure. The prevalence and incidence of dementia in twins is comparable to that in singletons, and hence the results are generalizable.[18]

Several limitations warrant note: Although the sample is large, sensitivity of dementia diagnoses in the NPR is only 50%.[19, 31] Nevertheless, the specificity is nearly 100%, and hence the bias, if any, would be towards the null.[32] Given the long pre-clinical course for dementia, it is difficult to be certain that hospitalization is prior to pre-clinical disease. Repeated hospitalization may increase caregiver awareness of already existing cognitive deficits and increase the likelihood of being recorded with dementia compared to non-hospitalized individuals, i.e. surveillance bias. While there was elevated risk associated with non-surgical hospitalizations at all intervals prior to dementia diagnosis in the register cohort, we found no elevated risk in the first 5 years after surgical hospitalization. We excluded orthopaedic surgeries due to proximal femur fractures from the analysis, as some individuals may be in a phase of cognitive decline that potentially could lead to falls requiring surgical correction. Indeed, the analyses revealed that femur fractures did lead to an increased risk. We were unable to separate the effect of surgery beyond the effect of hospitalization, nevertheless, the risk associated with surgical hospitalizations was lower than that associated with non-surgical hospitalizations. Finally, we lack detailed perioperative information e.g. duration of surgery, anaesthesia, postoperative delirium, and are thus unable to evaluate the effect of anaesthesia and surgery separately.

4.1 Conclusions

Non-surgical hospitalization, particularly repeated hospitalization, is associated with a greater risk for dementia than hospitalization with a surgical intervention. The risks associated with hospitalization are apparent in those not already at genetic risk for dementia. While the direction of the association cannot be determined, and those with pre-clinical dementia may be at increased risk for hospitalization, the implication is to focus on improved medical management for conditions that lead to repeated hospitalization and relapse that requires return to hospital, and ultimately diagnosed dementia. Patients and care-providers should be more concerned about the underlying causes of repeated hospitalizations or critical illness than about surgery as a risk factor for dementia.

Research in context

Systematic review:

We reviewed the literature using PubMed. Early studies focused on risk of cognitive impairment after coronary artery bypass surgery. Substantial attention has been paid to whether surgical anaesthesia constitutes a long-term risk for dementia. Few studies evaluated risk related to hospitalization per se. Few, if any, studies considered genetic susceptibility in these associations.

Interpretation:

We followed patients for up to 20 years after hospitalization to determine incident dementia risk. Repeated non-surgical hospitalization is associated with greater risk for dementia than hospitalization for surgery, with certain surgeries also resulting in risk for dementia. By comparisons within twin pairs, we determined that genetic susceptibility influenced the association.

Future directions:

Still to be answered is the mechanism by which non-surgical hospitalizations are associated with elevated risk for dementia, including whether the same underlying processes are leading to both hospitalization and dementia.
