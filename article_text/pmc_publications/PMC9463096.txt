Background and Objective:

Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a potentially treatable cause of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) that may mimic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Alzheimer disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers may discriminate CJD from AD, but utility in discriminating CJD and AE is unclear. This study compared AD CSF biomarkers in CJD and AE.

Methods:

Patients with probable or definite CJD and probable or definite AE who underwent Roche Elecsys AD CSF biomarker testing at Mayo Clinic from March 2020 through April 2021 were included. Total-tau (t-tau), phosphorylated181 tau (p-tau), and amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) levels were compared.

Results:

Of 11 CJD cases, 4 were autopsy proven; the rest had positive real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) testing. Disease-associated autoantibodies were detected in 8/15 cases of AE: LGI1 and NIF (2 cases each), and NMDAR, CASPR2, DPPX, and IgLON5. T-tau provided excellent discrimination between CJD and AE in a univariate model (OR 1.46 per 100pg/mL, CI 1.17-2.11, p &lt;.05, c=0.93). T-tau was elevated in 91% of CJD cases (median &gt;1300, range 236 - &gt;1300 pg/mL), of which 55% were above the limit of assay measurement (&gt;1300 pg/mL). T-tau was elevated in 20% of AE cases (median 158, range 80-&gt;1300 pg/mL).

Conclusion:

T-tau was greater in CJD than AE. Given that Aβ42 and p-tau were comparable, the ratio differences were likely driven by elevated t-tau in CJD. This study supports the role for AD biomarker testing in patients with RPD.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
Autoimmune Encephalitis

pmcIntroduction:

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a progressive prion disease and common cause of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD).1 By contrast, autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a potentially treatable cause of RPD that may mimic CJD clinically.2 Given the broad differential diagnosis in a patient with RPD—including CJD, atypical presentations of common age-related neurodegenerative diseases (most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD)), and potentially reversible causes (e.g., AE)—the RPD evaluation should include cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography, and autoimmune antibody screening to evaluate for CJD mimics.3,4,5

CSF biomarkers of AD have established utility in discriminating between patients with RPD due to AD and CJD.6 Low amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) is a biomarker of cerebral amyloidosis and elevated phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) is a biomarker of neurofibrillary tangles, both of which are hallmarks of AD pathology.7 Elevated total-tau (t-tau) is a non-specific biomarker of neurodegeneration.7 Increased t-tau levels or an elevated t-tau/p-tau ratio have been shown to distinguish CJD from AD dementia.6 Increased access to reliable, accurate, and expedited AD biomarker measures has led to greater application of AD biomarker measures in the evaluation of RPD patients.1 However, the role of AD biomarkers in patients with potentially reversible autoimmune causes of RPD remains unknown.

Stable/normal levels of CSF t-tau have been reported in acute NMDAR, LGI1, and CASPR2 antibody-associated encephalitis, whereas IgLON5 autoimmunity has been associated with an atypical tauopathy on histopathology, suggesting some neurodegenerative biomarkers may vary in AE.8,9 Although less is known of CSF Aβ42 and p-tau measures in this patient population, the relative specificity of these biomarkers for cerebral amyloidosis and tau neuropathology suggests that combinations of AD biomarkers may be useful in differentiating patients with prion-mediated, neurodegenerative, or autoimmune causes of RPD. The objective of this study was to compare CSF AD biomarkers measured at time of disease presentation in patients with CJD or AE.

Methods:

Subject Selection and Diagnostic Criteria

The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (Rochester, MN) approved this study. Participants were included if they were assessed within the Mayo Clinic Enterprise (Jacksonville, FL; Rochester, MN; Scottsdale, AZ), underwent Roche Elecsys AD CSF biomarker (Roche Diagnostics) testing from March 2020 through April 2021, and had a diagnosis of probable or definite CJD based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria, or AE based on consensus criteria.10,1,11

AD CSF Biomarker Values

The Mayo Clinic Roche Elecsys AD CSF biomarker cutoffs were utilized for t-tau (238 pg/mL), p-tau181 (22 pg/mL), Aβ42 (1026 pg/mL), p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (0.023), and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio (0.26).12 AD CSF biomarker cutoffs at Mayo Clinic were based on concordance with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and were optimized for evaluation of AD.12 Although each individual biomarker can be considered abnormal if it is beyond the cutoff threshold, for a sample to be considered clinically consistent with AD a CSF profile must have p-tau/Aβ42 ratio &gt;0.023.

Statistical Analysis

CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/p-tau ratio, Aβ42, p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio) were compared between patients with CJD and AE using separate ANCOVA models, controlling for age. Odds ratios for each CSF measure to predict diagnosis (AE versus CJD) were derived using logistic regression (without age adjustment). Discrimination between the two groups was summarized using a univariate concordance statistic. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. Demographic differences in age, education, and disease duration between the two groups were assessed via Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Sex differences between groups were evaluated by chi-squared tests. T-tau values above the upper limit of assay measurement (&gt;1300 pg/mL) were treated as 1300 pg/mL for calculations. Because of this skewed and censored distribution of t-tau, we also performed a nonparametric analysis using a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test on t-tau after regressing out the effect of age. Analyses were performed using BlueSky Statistics version 7.40, blueskystatistics.com, BlueSky Statistics LLC, Chicago, IL.

Results:

Demographics

Eleven patients were diagnosed with sporadic CJD. Four patients had definite CJD confirmed at autopsy (36%) and the remaining 7 had probable CJD based on real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assays confirming the presence of abnormal prion protein in the CSF (64%); testing performed by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center; Case Western Reserve, Cleveland, OH). Three patients underwent genetic testing; none had PRNP mutations.

Fifteen patients were diagnosed with AE. Of these, 13 had subacute onset (&lt;4 months) of new neurological deficits. Six met consensus criteria for possible AE, one had autoantibody-negative but probable AE, and eight had definite AE (Table 1).11 Of the 7 cases with disease-associated autoantibodies, 6 were against cell-surface antigens NMDAR, LGI1 (2 cases), CASPR2, DPPX, and IgLON5 and 1 had antibodies against cytoskeletal neuronal intermediate filaments (NIFs). Two-thirds of the AE cases (10/15) were responsive to immunosuppressive therapy.

Demographics and AD CSF biomarker measures for both groups are summarized in Table 2. Age, sex, education, and median disease durations were comparable across the two groups.

AD CSF Biomarker Profile in Patients with CJD

In the CJD group, the median t-tau was above the level of quantification (&gt; 1300 pg/mL, 236-&gt;1300) and above the established AD cutoffs of &gt;238 pg/mL. Median levels of the other markers were p-tau = 18 (11-27) pg/mL, Aβ42 = 1066 (624-1700) pg/mL, and p-tau/Aβ42 ratio = 0.016 (0.008-0.027). All three measures were considered normal according to established AD cutoffs (p-tau &gt;22 pg/mL, Aβ42 ≤1026 pg/mL, p-tau/Aβ42 ratio &gt;0.023). The median t-tau/p-tau ratio was 56 (13-99) and the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio was 0.81 (0.27-1.52) (measures which do not have associated AD cutoffs).

Of the 11 CJD cases, only one patient had a “normal” t-tau of 236 pg/mL (AD cutoff 238 pg/mL). This patient exhibited a relatively slow evolution of symptoms over 1 year with progressive restricted diffusion within the cortical ribbon on brain MRI over 5 years. Five patients (45%) had abnormally low Aβ42 (range 624-857); one was found to have sparse medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles (Braak stage II) and mild amyloid angiopathy on autopsy. Another patient with borderline low-normal CSF Aβ42 (1066) underwent autopsy was found to have rare tangles in medial temporal and frontal lobes (A0 B1 C0: “low” probability of accounting for the clinical syndrome).13

AD CSF Biomarker Profile in Patients with AE

In the AE group, the median t-tau of 158 (80-&gt;1300) pg/mL was within the normal range based on established AD cutoffs, as were the median p-tau (12 pg/mL, 8-40) and p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (0.010, 0.007-0.061). The median Aβ42 (935 pg/mL, 464-1700) was abnormal/below the established AD cutoff of ≤1026 pg/mL. The median t-tau/p-tau ratio was 12 (8-56) and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio was 0.14 (0.07-1.39).

One patient had treatment-responsive NIF-autoantibody-mediated AE with a t-tau of 328 pg/mL, p-tau of 40 pg/mL, p-tau/Aβ42 ratio of 0.061, Aβ42 of 647 pg/mL, and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio of 0.51. One patient had a t-tau level greater than the reference range (&gt;1300 pg/mL). This patient’s CSF RT-QuIC assay was negative and their brain MRI demonstrated left greater than right medial temporal lobe atrophy with associated focal T2 hyperintensity, consistent with the diagnosis of antibody-negative autoimmune limbic encephalitis, not CJD.

AD CSF Biomarker Profile in CJD and AE

T-tau level (F=22.4, p.adj&lt;0.001), t-tau/p-tau ratio (F=24.1, p.adj&lt;0.001), and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio (F=24.1, p.adj&lt;0.001) were different between the CJD and AE groups based on repeated ANCOVA and after adjusting for age influence on tau levels (Figures 1 and 2). A 100 pg/mL increase in t-tau was associated with approximately 50% higher odds of CJD versus AE (OR=1.46, 95% CI 1.17–2.11; p.adj &lt;0.05). T-tau measures were highly effective at discriminating between the two groups (c=0.93, univariate concordance model). For a 10-point increase in the t-tau/p-tau ratio, there was an estimated 2.6-fold increase in the odds of CJD versus AE (95% CI 1.51–6.43; p.adj &lt;0.05). Discrimination using this t-tau/p-tau ratio was also high (c=0.93). Lastly, for a 0.1-point increase in the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio, there were approximately 50% higher odds of CJD versus AE with effective discrimination between the two groups (OR 1.49, CI 1.16-2.17, p.adj&lt;0.05, c=0.92).

Discussion

CSF levels of t-tau were elevated above the established AD cut-point (&gt;1300 pg/mL) in 10 of 11 CJD cases in this study. This finding is consistent with reports suggesting that CSF t-tau levels are a nonspecific marker of neuronal injury.12,7,1 Notably, t-tau levels were above the upper limit of measurement in 55% of CJD cases. The one case which was not elevated was at the upper limit of normal for t-tau (236 pg/mL vs cutoff of &gt;238 pg/mL) and had a relatively slow progression, similar to a previously reported case of variably proteinase-sensitive prionopathy, which also had a normal t-tau and a relatively slow evolution of symptoms.14 For comparison, our group’s prior study which was used to establish the current AD CSF biomarker assay cutoffs for AD reported a median t-tau level of 318 pg/mL, p-tau of 29 pg/mL, Aβ42 of 479 pg/mL, and p-tau/Aβ42 ratio of 0.069 for their 42 amyloid-PET confirmed cases of AD dementia.12 Our CJD population demonstrated a higher median t-tau (&gt;1300 pg/mL) and Aβ42 (1066 pg/mL) and lower median values of p-tau (18 pg/mL) and the p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (0.81); with only the t-tau in the abnormal ranges.

Of the four autopsy confirmed cases, two underwent full brain autopsy; the patient with Braak stage II had low CSF Aβ42 (624) and borderline p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (0.02, cutoff &gt; 0.023), whereas the patient with Braak stage I had borderline low-normal Aβ42 (1066, cutoff &lt; 1026)) and normal ratio (0.014). Both had normal p-Tau. Similar to other causes of dementia, comorbid AD pathology should be considered in CJD patients with low Aβ42 and/or abnormal p-tau/Aβ42 ratios.

Median t-tau levels were in the normal range in AE patients. Six of 8 autoantibody-positive cases were against cell-surface receptors, consistent with previous reports demonstrating lack of neuronal destruction in cell-surface antibody mediated causes of AE.8 Median Aβ42 was low (935 pg/mL, cutoff &lt;1026 pg/mL) whereas p-tau levels and the p-tau/Aβ42 ratio were normal. In the presence of a normal p-tau/ Aβ42 ratio, isolated low Aβ42 would not be consistent with co-morbid AD pathology and highlights the potential pitfalls of interpreting single AD CSF biomarker in isolation. Nonetheless, the cause of low Aβ42 in these AE cases remains unclear; neuroinflammation may influence CSF dynamics, inhibit Aβ42 clearance from the brain, or decrease Aβ42 in CSF. Compared to a prior study from our group using amyloid-PET confirmed AD, the AE population had a lower median t-tau (158 pg/mL), p-tau (12 pg/mL), and p-tau/Aβ42 ratio (12.0), all within normal limits; and a higher (relatively more normal) median Aβ42 (935 pg/mL).

One patient with immunosuppressant-responsive NIF-autoantibody-mediated AE was also given an initial diagnosis of co-morbid AD dementia based on clinical symptoms and CSF consistent with AD pathology (low Aβ42, elevated p-tau, t-tau, and abnormal p-tau/Aβ42 ratio). This is consistent with previous literature describing AD co-pathology in older patients with AE.15,16

Comparing the two RPD groups, t-tau, the t-tau/p-tau ratio, and the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio were significantly higher in CJD than AE. Given Aβ42 and p-tau were comparable between the two groups, the differences in these ratios were likely driven by elevations in t-tau in the CJD group. This is consistent with previous literature showing elevated t-tau in CJD and normal t-tau in AE.1,17,8 Most importantly, this study highlights the presence of an elevated t-tau/p-tau ratio in CJD compared to AE, which is consistent with previous studies showing a greater t-tau/p-tau ratio in CJD when compared to frontotemporal dementia and AD-dementia and suggests another use for AD biomarker tests in evaluating patients with RPD.6,18,19,20 Finally, the p-tau/Aβ42 ratio, another marker for evaluating AD pathology in CSF, was within normal range (not consistent with AD) and comparable between patients with CJD and AE.

Limitations and Future Directions

The generalizability of our results is limited by its small sample size and heterogeneity in the clinical population. The CSF studies were collected as a part of clinical practice, and as such timing of CSF studies from symptom onset, time to treatment, and time from treatment were not standardized between groups. Moreover, there is significant heterogeneity in the AE antibodies (although t-tau levels were not significantly different between the AE subgroups) and the biomarker cutoffs in this study were optimized based on concordance with amyloid PET and are therefore designed to detect AD rather than CJD or AE.12

Future larger studies will be needed to truly assess the sensitivity of established assay cutoffs and to establish CJD and AE specific cut points. Additional biomarkers should also be explored in differentiating the RPDs, including those specific for Alzheimer’s disease such as Aβ40 and the Aβ40/Aβ40 ratio, and the performance of nonspecific markers of neurodegeneration such as CSF neurofilament light chain. Furthermore, these markers should be compared in a broader clinical setting with additional control groups including neurodegenerative diseases.

Conclusions

Significant differences in the AD CSF biomarker profile were observed between patients with RPD due to CJD versus AE. T-tau was elevated (abnormal) in CJD but not AE. When differentiating between the two disorders, elevated t-tau in a patient with normal Aβ42, p-tau, and p-tau/Aβ42 ratio should increase suspicion for CJD. T-tau/p-tau ratio and t-tau/Aβ42 ratios were also higher in patients with CJD vs AE. This study suggests that AD CSF biomarkers may be useful in differentiating CJD from its potentially treatable mimicker, AE.
