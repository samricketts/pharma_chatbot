The number of people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasing rapidly every year. One aspect of AD that is often overlooked is the disproportionate incidence of AD among African American/Black populations. With the recent development of novel assays for lipidomics analysis in recent times, there has been a drastic increase in the number of studies focusing on changes of lipids in AD. However, very few of these studies have focused on or even included samples from African American/Black individuals samples. In this study, we aimed to determine if the lipidome in AD is universal across non-Hispanic White and African American/Black individuals. To accomplish this, a targeted mass spectrometry lipidomics analysis was performed on plasma samples (N = 113) obtained from cognitively normal (CN, N = 54) and AD (N = 59) individuals from African American/Black (N = 56) and non-Hispanic White (N = 57) backgrounds. Five lipids (PS 18:0_18:0, PS 18:0_20:0, PC 16:0_22:6, PC 18:0_22:6, and PS 18:1_22:6) were altered between AD and CN sample groups (p value &lt; 0.05). Upon racial stratification, there were notable differences in lipids that were unique to African American/Black or non-Hispanic White individuals. PS 20:0_20:1 was reduced in AD in samples from non-Hispanic White but not African American/Black adults. We also tested whether race/ethnicity significantly modified the association between lipids and AD status by including a race × diagnosis interaction term in a linear regression model. PS 20:0_20:1 showed a significant interaction (p = 0.004). The discovery of lipid changes in AD in this study suggests that identifying relevant lipid biomarkers for diagnosis will require diversity in sample cohorts.

Graphical Abstract


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the fastest growing diseases with currently 5.8 million American sufferers.1 One aspect of this disease that is severely understudied is the disproportionate impact of AD among the African American/Black population. AD is the fourth leading cause of death among African American/Black adults.2 African American/Black adults have a higher incidence of AD compared to non-Hispanic White adults.1,3,4 By 2050, of the number of people aged 65 and older, 40% will be African American/Black and Hispanics.5 This is extremely concerning as age is the largest risk factor for AD.1 The initial manifestation of AD in terms of pathological hallmarks is similar for both African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults;3,6 however, mixed dementia may be more prominent among African American/Black adults.6

Socioeconomic factors such as systemic racism,7 education,8–10 and healthcare access11 are contributing factors to racial disparities in AD. African American/Black individuals have been reported to be less willing to seek care and participate in AD research studies. Simultaneously, comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, all of which increases the incidence risk for AD, have higher incidence rates among US African American/Black individuals.11,12 Similarly, genetic factors such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) and single nucleotide poly morphisms of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) gene have been linked to higher prevalence of AD among African American/Black individuals.12 However, in addition to the APOE status, other genes have been demonstrated as significant risk factors in African American/Black adults.11,13,14 In addition, a GWAS study of African American/Black samples has identified AD-associated SNPs in BIN1, PICALM, and CLU, which increases the risk of AD.12

Recent studies have reported differences among African American/Black and non-Hispanic White individuals when it comes to established AD biomarkers. For example, the concentration levels of tau and phosphorylated tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)15,16 and interleukin-9 in plasma from African American/Black individuals were lower than those in non-Hispanic Whites.17 Our laboratory recently identified 568 differentially-expressed proteins in AD in postmortem brain tissues from African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults. Race stratification of data led to unique proteins that were only differentially expressed in only one racial/ethnic group, and 185 proteins had a significant dependence on both race and AD diagnosis. In plasma samples, we identified 27 differentially-expressed proteins in AD; however, we determined that the performance of these proteins as potential diagnostic biomarker candidates from machine learning algorithms was heavily impacted by the racial background associated with the samples.18,19 Whether or not these molecular differences are casual or the result of “weathering”20–23 in combination with social, environmental, and genetic factors is not clear. Additionally, these studies are small in number and require replication.

Numerous studies have demonstrated a link between AD and altered lipid metabolism making lipids key in the pathogenesis of AD.12,24–27 Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation have further accelerated lipidomics applications in AD research.28–33 Reduction in the plasma levels of glycerophospholipids, especially phosphatidylcholines, has been reported.34–39 Several studies have proposed lipid biomarker panels for AD discovery including phosphatidylcholines.38–40 Other glycerophospholipids altered in AD plasma include phosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, and plasmalogens.35–37,41–44 Sphingolipids change in plasma from AD adults such that the sphingomyelin levels decrease and the ceramide levels increase in AD.45–48 Diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols also change in AD,45,49–51 and together these studies support the role of lipids in AD and their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers.

Despite the large number of studies involving lipids in AD, very few have focused on or included samples from African American/Black adults. A recent study of the lipid panel proposed by Mapstone et al.38 failed to replicate in a cohort of African American/Black adults.52 Similar lipidomics evidence of racial disparities in cancer and myocardial infarction,53–56 cardiometabolic diseases,57 as well lupus58 has been reported. Distinct metabolite profiles were observed in African American/Black adults with bladder cancer.55 Together, these studies point to potential molecular differences in lipids that warrant further studies in the context of AD.

Here, we conducted a pilot lipidomics study using plasma samples from cognitively normal (CN) and AD individuals of African American/Black and non-Hispanic White backgrounds. Plasma samples were analyzed using a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) MS-targeted lipidomics analysis of ∼1150 lipids, recently evaluated in our laboratory.1 filtering of the lipid panel was conducted to focus on phospholipid and sphingomyelin classes, which have notable reported changes in AD (as described above). The goal was to determine if the plasma lipidome of AD is universal and if there are heterogeneities associated with the racial and ethnic backgrounds of African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults that may impact biomarker discovery efforts. Our findings signify the importance of inclusion in AD research as our results demonstrate some differences in lipid expression in AD based on racial background.

METHODS

Plasma Demographics.

Plasma samples (N = 113) from African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). Detailed characteristics are given in Supplemental Table S1, including years since disease onset. Approval for the participation of human subjects was obtained by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Pittsburgh and Vanderbilt University. The diseased individuals were clinically diagnosed with probable AD at the time of draw according to the criteria of the National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer’s Association and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center.59–62 Blood from the most recent draw was used for this analysis.

Lipid Extraction.

Plasma samples were divided into four batches in such a way that there were no differences among the batches in terms of the number of samples from each study group or other variables such as age, sex, and presence of comorbidities. Each sample batch was prepared simultaneously and run sequentially in order to stabilize the quality control of the experiment with regard to the instrumental setup and pH of chromatographic buffers. The plasma sample (25 μL) was transferred into a borosilicate glass tube followed by addition of internal standards (Splash Lipidomix, Avanti Polar, Alabaster, AL) at a 1:1 ratio of internal standard (IS):plasma. The complete list of IS and their corresponding concentrations has been described previously.1 Water, methanol, and chloroform at a 1:2:0.9 ratio was added to the glass tube. The mixture was vortexed and left to sit at room temperature for 30 min. Next, water and chloroform were added at a 1:0.9 ratio and the sample tube was inverted several times. The tubes were centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 30 min. The bottom organic layer containing the lipids was carefully collected, and 2 mL of chloroform was added to the aqueous phase (upper layer) to re-extract the lipids. Tubes were vortexed and centrifuged again. The subsequent bottom layer was combined with the previously collected lipids and dried down using a nitrogen stream.

Liquid Chromatography (LC)–MS/MS Analyses.

The extracted lipids were reconstituted using the 9:1 methanol:chloroform solvent. The LC–MS/MS method used in this study has been described previously.1 In short, the LC–MS/MS analysis was performed using an ExionLC system coupled to a Sciex 6500+ mass spectrometer. The lipids were loaded onto a Waters XBridge amide column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, 3.5 μm) using a thermostated autosampler. The LC method details are as follows: column temperature = 35 °C, a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min, and injection volume = 5 μL. The mobile phases were as follows: solvent A (water:acetonitrile) at a 5:95 ratio with 10 mM ammonium acetate (adjusted to pH 8.2) and solvent B (water:acetonitrile) at a 50:50 ratio with 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.2. Chromatographic separation was achieved with the following gradient: 0–6% B over 6 min, 6–25% B for 4 min, 25–98% B for 1 min, 98–100% B for 2 min, 100% B for 5.6 min, 100–0.1% B for 0.1 min, and 0.1% B for 5.3 min for a total gradient time of 24 min. The source and gas settings were as follows: curtain gas (N2) pressure, 35 a.u.; CAD gas (N2) pressure, medium (positive mode) and low (negative mode); ion spray voltage, 5.5 kV (positive mode) and −4.5 kV (negative mode); temperature, 550 °C; ion source gas 1, 50 a.u.; and ion source gas 2, 60 a.u. The compound settings were as follows: declustering potential, 60 V (positive mode) and −200 V (negative mode); entrance potential, 10 V (positive mode) and −10 V (negative mode); collision energy, 43 V (positive mode) and −50 V (negative mode); and collision cell exit potential, 15 V (positive mode) and −12 V (negative mode). In order to check the quality of the data, a quality control sample containing an equimolar pool of all patient samples was injected every 12 h.

Data Analysis.

Data processing was performed using SCIEX OS software for peak integration and postdata acquisition analysis. For peak integration, the following parameters were used: minimum peak width, 2 points; S/N integration threshold, 2; noise percentage, 80%; baseline subtract window, 2 min; and peak splitting, 2 points. Analyte concentrations were calculated as follows: analyte concentration =analyte area/IS area×IS concentration

where IS denotes the internal standard for a given lipid class.1 Batch correction and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed using Metaboanalyst.63 Altered lipids (p value &lt; 0.05) were determined using Student’s t-tests. Multiple hypothesis testing using Bonferroni correction64 was applied to find altered lipids using an in-house R script. Given that we observed some small deviations from normality for some analytes, we also reran all t-tests leveraging a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test for comparison. Finally, to adjust for relevant covariates and statistically evaluate race differences in AD associations, we regressed each analyte on age, sex, race, diagnosis, and APOE-ε4 status using linear regression. We evaluated race-stratified models separately and evaluated one model including a race × diagnosis interaction term. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons across these additional models.

RESULTS

Plasma samples (N = 113) were obtained from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center from African American/Black (AD = 30 and CN = 26) and non-Hispanic White (AD = 29 and CN = 28) adults. A detailed description of the sample demographics is provided in Supplemental Table S1. The samples had no significant differences in terms of sex, age, and presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, which were all self-reported by the patient during sample collection. We believe that the comorbidity information being self-reported did not influence the final findings in our study. The average age was 73.6 ± 8.5 years for the four study groups. Mini-mental state examination scores for the AD groups were lower than those for the CN groups and had no differences based on racial background. On average, the non-Hispanic White CN group had a higher number of years of education compared to the remaining study groups. The African American/Black CN group had the highest BMI compared to the other groups. The African American/Black AD group had the highest number of individuals having APOE 4/4 genotype, and the AD groups had a higher number of individuals having APOE 4/4 or 3/4 genotype.

A general overview of the lipidomics workflow is shown in Figure 1a. ISs were added to the crude plasma (25 μL) and lipid extraction was performed. The extracted lipids were analyzed using an MRM-based LC–MS/MS analysis, the details of which have been described previously.65,66 In total, the MRM assay contains 1214 lipids from 19 classes specific for human plasma and ISs (figure 1b). In the first step, an unscheduled analysis was performed for each batch to determine the retention times of the lipid species and also to eliminate any nondetectable lipids from the assay. The unscheduled assay of 1160 lipids was reduced to 733 after the requirement that lipids were present in all four sample batches. Next, we filtered the data to only include lipids from glycerophospholipid and sphingomyelin classes (i.e., 355 lipids). Finally, we removed lipids with an average %CV &gt; 20% across all the samples to generate a final robust set of 329 lipid species (Figure 1b) for further analysis. Based on the final number of lipids, sample sizes of 26–30 per group, and triplicate MS injections for each sample, we are adequately powered (z = 0.8) to detect lipid differences across groups with a fold change of 1.15 (p &lt; 0.05). The distribution of the lipid species based on their respective classes is shown in Figure 1c. The majority of these lipids (56%) were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) species. The remaining lipid classes were phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG), and sphingomyelins (SM) (Figure 1c).

Next, to eliminate any possible issues due to multiple batch sample preparation, we performed batch correction and assessed the variation of the data (Supplemental Figure S1). The ISs had lower %CV variation (3.5–15.2%) for LPG, PE, PG, PS, and SM lipid classes, while PI had the highest variation across the four batches (Supplemental Figure S1a). Overall, across all the lipid classes, the average %CV was &lt;20%, with LPE, LPG, PE, PG, and SM species having the lowest %CV values (3.3–10.8%) among all the lipid classes (Supplemental Figure S1b). These CV values demonstrate the robustness of this data set and gave us a confident set of lipids to evaluate for changes in AD.

Altered Lipids in AD.

We performed PLS-DA in order to determine if lipids could distinguish between AD and CN sample groups (Figure 2a). The PLS-DA plot shows a clear separation between CN and AD study groups using the lipidomics profile. PLS-DA achieved positive scores for both Q2 and R2 scores (data not shown). Next, we compared the lipid species concentration of lipid classes in AD and CN groups (Supplemental Figure S2). There was a significant decrease (p value &lt; 0.05) between AD and CN sample groups for the overall total lipid concentration, especially for the PC and PS lipid classes. Other classes did not have significant changes in the AD group. Upon multiple hypothesis testing, five lipids were altered between AD and CN groups, all of which were decreased in AD samples (Figure 2b). Example box plots of altered lipids in AD groups are shown in Figure 2c–f with their respective structures. These lipid species were PS 18:0_18:0, PS 18:0_20:0, PC 16:0_22:6, PC 18:0_22:6, and PS 18:1_22:6 (Table 1).

Altered Lipids in Race-Stratified AD Groups.

Lipid data were reanalyzed by PLS-DA based on racial background stratification of CN and AD groups (Figure 3). There was a strong overlap between CN racial groups and yet a clear separation between CN and AD groups in general. One strikingly noticeable feature here was the separation between the African American/Black and non-Hispanic White AD groups. In contrast to the CN groups, none of the lipid features overlapped for any African American/Black and non-Hispanic White AD adults. Next, we determined the altered lipids between African American/Black CN and AD sample groups. After consideration of the adjusted p values, for the African American/Black sample group, only PS 18:0_18:0 met the criteria for altered lipids, while PS 18:0_18:0 and PG 16:0_20:4 were altered in the non-Hispanic White groups (Supplemental Tables S2 and S3 and Supplemental Figure S3a–d). These lipids were all reduced in the AD groups. We note that there were no significant deviations from a normal distribution in these data, and results from nonparametric tests of race-stratified comparisons (Supplemental Table S3) were similar to those reported in Supplemental Table S2.

In order to provide a comprehensive perspective of lipid differences, we also reanalyzed the data covarying for the effects of age, sex, and APOE-ε4 status. The findings from these analyses have been summarized in Table 2 and present 25 lipids which are significantly altered in samples from African American/Black AD compared to CN individuals. From this group of 25, three lipids (PS 18:0_18:0, PC 16:0_18:2, and PC 16:0_22:6) met the FDR criteria. In samples from non-Hispanic White AD compared to CN individuals, 37 lipids were altered in AD and three lipids (PS 18:0_18:0, PS 20:0_20:1, and PC 16:0_18:2) met the FDR criteria (Table 2). Note that both PS 18:0_18:0 and PC 16:0_18:2 were consistent across both racial groups. We also tested whether race/ethnicity significantly modified the association between lipids and AD status by including a race × diagnosis interaction term in a linear regression model. Interestingly, PS 20:0_20:0 (Figure 4) had a statistically significant race × diagnosis interaction (p = 0.004) whereby the lipid was reduced in the non-Hispanic White group and not in the African American/Black group (p = 0.22). We do note, however, that the African American/Black AD group had a large error bar, which could impact the significance of the results as well as the magnitude of change. Additional studies would be necessary to confirm the impact of racial background on lipid levels presented in this study.

DISCUSSION

Here, we conducted an MRM-based targeted lipidomics study on plasma samples obtained from African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults that were CN or clinically diagnosed with probable AD. Samples were carefully selected by matching for age, sex, and AD diagnosis and as a result there were no significant differences among these variables.

We acquired MS data on 1160 lipid species from 19 different lipid classes and reduced our analysis to 329 lipid species from glycerophospholipid (GP) and sphingomyelin (SM) classes. These classes represent a majority of the reported changes in lipid species in AD such as PC, PE, PG, PS, PI, LPC, LPE, LPG, and SM lipid classes, with 38% of the lipids constituting PE species.35–39,41–43,46,47,49,67–69 PLS-DA of the lipid species revealed clear separation between CN and AD sample groups, indicating the ability of lipids to distinguish diagnosed cases of AD. For individual lipid classes, PC showed an overall decrease in AD, findings similar to previous studies.35,36,38,39,43,47,67–69 In this study, we measured alteration in PS in AD, which has not been previously reported in plasma. After application of strict criteria, we identified five lipid species that were decreased in AD. Among them, PS 18:0_18:0 had the largest significance (adjusted p value = 2.28 × 10−30 and fold change = 0.76) and represents a novel finding. PC 16:0_22:6 and PC 18:0_22:6 were decreased in our study and supported by others.35,39,68 PS 18:0_20:0 and PC 18:1_22:6 are also novel findings in this study.

Alteration of phospholipid metabolism in AD has been previously reported.32 PC accounts for 32.8% of human brain70 and a loss of PC content has been reported in early and late stages of AD,38,39 indicating its critical role in AD progression. Both PC 16:0_22:6 and PC 18:0_22:6 have been correlated to poorer memory performance in nondemented individuals.71,72 These two lipids along with PC 16:0_20:5 have been well evaluated as potential AD biomarkers in plasma.39 On the other hand, involvement of PS in AD has not been as well studied compared to other lipid classes despite it being a major component of the plasma membrane.30 Reduced PS in the brain cortex from the AD mouse model and increase of PS in brain of AD patients have been reported.73–75

A critical design of this study was the inclusion of samples from both African American/Black and non-Hispanic White study groups. It is generally regarded that African American/Black adults have a much healthier lipid profile (i.e., lower serum triglyceride and higher serum high-density lipoprotein levels) compared to non-Hispanic White adults.76 Despite this, African American/Black adults have a higher incidence of AD and other lipid-relevant diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Alterations in specific lipid classes such as sphingomyelins and phospholipids may help to link diabetes, for example, to the development of dementia as inactivation of protein kinase B can inhibit glycogen synthase and directly lead to increases of pathological hallmarks, amyloid-beta, and hyperphosphorylated tau.77 However, it is not clear how peripheral lipids contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression as plasma contains circulating lipids, lipids leaking across the blood–brain barrier, dietary lipids, and lipids secreted from other organs.25 In this study, the lipidome of African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults with AD was highly distinguishable, whereas CN adults were more similar in both racial backgrounds. It is possible that the distinction is a result of disease heterogeneity or other underlying factors unique in the racial groups or samples selected for this study. Comparatively lower triglyceride concentrations in African American/Black adults have been well reported.76,78 Additionally, the inability to replicate the lipidomics results of a non-Hispanic White cohort38 in a cohort of African American/Black participants52 supports the notion that potential differences in lipidome profiles exist. Knowledge of such differences and environmental, genetic, and physiological factors that may contribute to this disparity in lipids76 is crucial for designing effective biomarker therapies and further to disease understanding.

In total, four lipids had abundance differences between AD and CN samples from either African American/Black (N = 56) or non-Hispanic White (N = 57) adults after performing stratified linear regression modeling and adjusting the model for age, sex, and APOE-ε4 status. Among these four lipids, PC 16:0_22:6 and PC 16:0_18:2 have been reported by others to be altered in AD.35,36,68 Neither of the remaining two lipids (PS 18:0_18:0 and PS 20:0_20:1) have been previously reported to change in AD and are novel findings in this study. PS 18:0_18:0 has drastically different profiles in CN and AD samples for both racial groups (Supplemental Figure S3), increasing its potential as a future biomarker in AD that may be universal. It is possible that PS 18:0_18:0 and PS 20:0_20:1 together could serve as diagnostic biomarkers for AD, but further studies need to be performed to replicate the results in a larger cohort of samples. Despite the robustness of these lipidomic measurements, the fold-change values for these lipids are small and may limit their clinical utility. These lipids also may be associated with other disease processes; thus, it is necessary to determine if they are AD-specific. However, it is more likely that they in addition to other omics or clinical markers in a multimarker panel would have better ability to discriminate AD. Overall, it is unclear what mechanisms are driving the lipids that are unique in a given racial group as there were no differences in age, sex, APOE-ε4 status, or comorbidities such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia. There was a significant difference in hypertension among the groups; however, the overall number of individuals with this data reported was 58% of the entire cohort. In order to best understand whether specific lipids may be race-specific, we first believe that replication in larger cohorts is necessary. Additionally, assessment of these lipids in other disease contexts and inflammatory conditions is necessary to determine their specificity and sensitivity as biomarker candidates for disease diagnosis in AD.

One of the major strengths of this study is the inclusion of plasma samples from African American/Black adults. General patient demographics were matched within groups. However, improvements could be made to examine social and other factors that may influence lipid profiles in future studies. Despite the challenges associated with obtaining plasma samples from African American/Black adults, our sample size was large enough to monitor changes with statistical confidence.

Another major strength of our study is that we were able to identify altered lipids despite using strict criteria for significance. We performed batch correction to account for any variation in sample preparation and data acquisition. Also, we added ISs specific to each of the lipid classes being studied and to endogenous lipids before extraction to account for any differences due to the extraction procedure. Despite this, further validation of these findings in a larger cohort is necessary to establish any of the lipids as potential biomarkers in AD.

A limitation of our study is the number of samples we included, which, although on par with several previous studies,35–39,45,49,79 could limit the statistical power achieved and ideally would be better supported with replication across other cohorts. One of the major drawbacks is the limited availability of African American/Black samples in the single ADRC selected, and future studies could include multiple centers to increase the overall sample size for this group. A limitation of this study could be our focus on a subset of lipid classes that have been previously implicated in AD. Although we added ISs specific to each lipid class, there were instances such as plasmalogens, where other lipid species-specific ISs would have provided more accurate quantitative information. One possible solution to this could be the use of Lipidyzer standards80 that have over 50 labeled molecular species from 13 different classes. Additionally, some of the lipid classes had higher %CV values and were filtered from our final data analysis steps. Recently, the targeted MRM method has been updated to include more lipid classes and lipid species.81 CSF, which may be a better fluid to assess changes in AD, has been shown to have higher concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids compared to plasma.82,83 However, plasma has higher levels of triglycerides and phosphatidylcholines that are very similar in concentrations across the two biofluids. CSF was not available for the samples used in this study. Future studies could focus on ceramides, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and cholesterol esters, which were not the subject of this study. Also, a recent study has linked lipid species from 33 lipid classes to genetic variants to find associations of specific genetic factors to altered lipid metabolism in AD using an integrative approach.84 In our pilot study, we only focused on a limited number of lipid classes and also only had access to previously collected APOE genetic information. The percent-age of APOE-ε4 carriers was not different in African American/Black and non-Hispanic White individuals in this cohort. We note that future studies could include information on genetic variants where possible. Because of the number of factors that impact lipid levels, such as diet, genetics, lifestyle, social and environmental factors, comorbidities, and disease status, we note that a more controlled prospective lipidomics study may better address full contributions of racial and ethnic backgrounds on the lipidome in AD.

CONCLUSIONS

A limited number of omics AD studies involving plasma samples from African American/Black adults exists. This study measures if lipidome profiles can help in further understanding the racial and ethnic disparities in AD by exploring whether there are race-specific differences in lipids. We identified lipid species previously reported by other studies in mostly non-Hispanic White adults but also identified novel lipid species changing in AD. The plasma lipidome profiles in individuals diagnosed with AD were overall distinct in African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults. Some altered lipids were common between African American/Black and non-Hispanic White adults but those that were had a consistent direction of change in AD. However, there was evidence that the association of one lipid, PS 20:0_20:1, differed by race/ethnicity and disease diagnosis, thereby highlighting the need for including diverse samples in studies of potential biomarkers of AD. Overall, with the increase in incidence of AD among minority groups, this study provides evidence that there is an urgent need for more omics research that includes African American/Black and other underrepresented minority populations. Additionally, it highlights the potential of lipids for AD biomarker discovery efforts.

Figure 1. Experimental workflow and distribution of lipid classes in the lipidomics experiment. (a) General workflow for the plasma lipidomics analysis: lipids are extracted from crude plasma samples and injected into an Exion HPLC system coupled to a Sciex QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer for MRM-based LC–MS, MS/MS analyses. (b) Distribution of lipids analyzed in different stages of method development and statistical analysis. (c) Pie chart showing the distribution of lipid classes in a final set of lipids (N = 329) (abbreviations: PG—phosphatidylglycerol, PI—phosphatidylinositol, PS—phosphatidylserine, PE—phosphatidylethanolamine, PC—phosphatidylcholine, LPC—lysophosphatidylcholine, LPE—lysophosphatidylethanolamine, LPG—lysophosphatidylglycerol, and SM—sphingomyelin).

Figure 2. Summary of results from the comparison between AD and CN individuals. (a) PLS-DA plot for the 329 lipids in CN (red) and AD (green) groups; (b) volcano plot of lipid ratios in AD/CN groups. Significant lipids after multiple hypothesis testing are shown in green and labeled accordingly; and (c–f) example box plots of altered lipids and their corresponding lipid structure. *Adjusted p value &lt; 0.05, **adjusted p value &lt; 0.01, and ***adjusted p value &lt; 0.001.

Figure 3. PLS-DA plot for the 329 lipids obtained from lipidomics analysis. The plot demonstrates the separation of the four study groups (African American/Black disease and CN and non-Hispanic White disease and CN) in the lipidomics analysis (abbreviations: AA CN (purple)—African American/Black cognitively normal, NHW CN—(orange) non-Hispanic White cognitively normal, AA AD (yellow)—African American/Black Alzheimer’s disease, and NHW AD (blue)—non-Hispanic White Alzheimer’s disease).

Figure 4. Box plot of PS 20:0_20:1 which had a significant race × diagnosis interaction. *p value = 0.004.
