Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and (shedding) microvesicles, are released by nearly all cell types and carry a cargo of proteins and nucleic acids that varies by the cell of origin. They are thought to play critical roles in normal central nervous system (CNS) function and neurological disorders. A recently revealed key characteristic of EVs is that they may travel between the CNS and peripheral circulation. This property has led to intense interest in how EVs might serve as a vehicle for toxic protein clearance and as a readily accessible source of biomarkers for CNS disorders. Furthermore, by bypassing the blood-brain barrier, modified EVs could serve as a unique drug delivery system that targets specific neuronal populations. Further work is necessary to develop and optimize techniques that enable high-yield capture of relevant EV populations, analyze individual EVs and their cargos, and validate preliminary results of EV-derived biomarkers in independent cohorts.


1. Introduction

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes, (shedding) microvesicles, and others, are membrane-bound vesicles released from cells into the extracellular space and capable of transporting cargo (e.g., DNAs, RNAs, and proteins) between cells as a form of intercellular communication (Budnik et al., 2016; Coleman and Hill, 2015; Lee et al., 2011; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015). The first observations of EVs and their relevance occurred in the 1940s – 1970s in various physiological settings, but they were not immediately recognized as a universally shared cell biological mechanism for function and communication (see review by (Yanez-Mo et al., 2015)). In the 1980s, several studies demonstrated that small EVs were released by multivesicular endosomes or elements (now called multivesicular bodies, or MVBs) fusing with the plasma membrane during reticulocyte maturation; these small EVs were believed to be an exocytotic mechanism of clearing transferrin receptors from cells and were named “exosomes” (Harding et al., 1983; Johnstone et al., 1987; Pan and Johnstone, 1983; Pan et al., 1985). One decade later, such EVs/exosomes released from B lymphocytes were found to be antigen-presenting and able to induce T-cell responses (Raposo et al., 1996). Additionally, similar EVs could also be secreted from dendritic cells, and tumor peptide-pulsed dendritic cell-derived EVs could stimulate the immune system to suppress tumor growth in mice (Zitvogel et al., 1998), further suggesting a role of EVs/exosomes in intercellular communication in the immune system. In the 2000s, with the discoveries that EVs carry proteins and RNAs, including microRNAs and mRNAs, and that EVs could transport functional mRNA between cells (Ratajczak et al., 2006; Valadi et al., 2007), their roles as mediators of cell-to-cell communication were further substantiated. Since then, EVs have been reported to be released from different types of cells, including neurons (Faure et al., 2006), astrocytes (Bianco et al., 2009), microglia (Potolicchio et al., 2005), and oligodendrocytes (Kramer-Albers et al., 2007); furthermore, EVs have been detected in blood plasma/serum (Caby et al., 2005; George et al., 1982), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (Harrington et al., 2009; Saman et al., 2012; Street et al., 2012), saliva, urine, and other body fluids (see reviews by (Budnik et al., 2016; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015)).

More recently, EVs have been implicated in neurological disorders, particularly in the transportation of key proteins [e.g., amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, and α-synuclein involved in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson disease (PD)] between different cells in the central nervous system (CNS) or between different brain regions (Budnik et al., 2016; Coleman and Hill, 2015; Thompson et al., 2016) (see more details in section 2 below). Trafficking of these EVs between brain and the peripheral systems is much less appreciated. In 2014, we demonstrated that α-synuclein, a protein that plays a central role in the pathophysiology of PD and related neurological disorders, could be transported from the brain into the peripheral circulation via EVs, and that CNS-derived EV-contained α-synuclein in plasma was diagnostically and prognostically relevant to PD (Shi et al., 2014). Since then, bloodborne CNS- or neuron-derived EVs, and the proteins and RNAs they carry, have shown substantial potential as “windows into the brain,” points of transparency allowing examination of peripheral blood to reveal CNS disorder-associated changes in brain biochemistry and intercellular communication (Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2015b; Goetzl et al., 2016b; Goetzl et al., 2018b; Hamlett et al., 2017; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Mustapic et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2016; Winston et al., 2016). This review will briefly highlight current understanding on the roles of EVs in CNS disorders, and then focus on the translational potential of CNS-derived EVs in developing novel clinical technologies. Particular emphasis will be placed on the necessity of improving existing protocols and the importance of developing novel tools for isolation, purification, and quantification of CNS-derived EVs, to enable accurate analysis of EV protein and RNA constituents.

2. Extracellular vesicles and their roles in neurological disorders

EVs have generally been divided into two different classes by size and origin. The smaller “exosome” class is relatively homogeneous in size (30–40 to ~150 nm) and is defined by origin within the endosomal network as intraluminal vesicles, formed by inward budding of the limiting membrane of late endosomes or MVBs, which subsequently fuse with the plasma membrane and release exosomes into the extracellular space (Coleman and Hill, 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015). In contrast, the larger “shedding microvesicle” (“ectosome”) class is heterogeneous in size (~100 to ~1,000 nm) and such vesicles bud directly from the plasma membrane. Other EV types, such as apoptotic bodies that are generally even larger and are released by cells undergoing apoptosis, will not be covered in this review. Currently, there are no consensus criteria to define different types of EVs (Yanez-Mo et al., 2015), and they often overlap in size and share some surface markers (e.g., tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81) (Mora et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015). Given the current lack of clarity on the definition of EVs and that many of the studies to date analyzed crude EV preparations largely due to the limitations of current technologies, guidelines published by the International Society of EVs (ISEV) propose (Gould and Raposo, 2013; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015) the use of the term EVs instead of exosomes and (shedding) microvesicles. We will thus use EVs from this point forward in this review.

As indicated in section 1, EVs can be secreted by most cell types in vitro, including neurons and astrocytes, and are detectable in different body fluids in vivo (Budnik et al., 2016; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015). The functions of EVs remain to be fully defined, but they have been recognized as an important cell-to-cell communication and signaling pathway in the body in both normal and disease settings (Budnik et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2011; Yanez-Mo et al., 2015). The many functions of EVs in the nervous system, including intercellular communication, maintenance of myelination, synaptic plasticity, antigen presentation, and trophic support of neurons, have been reviewed elsewhere (Budnik et al., 2016; Coleman and Hill, 2015; Thompson et al., 2016), and the current review focuses on the aspects that are relevant to CNS disorders, especially development of novel biomarkers.

EVs are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD. In these disorders, protein oligomers and aggregates (e.g., Aβ and tau in AD and tauopathies, α-synuclein in PD and other synucleinopathies) are widely considered to have a central role in neurodegeneration, and the role of EVs in toxic protein disposal is believed to be especially pertinent (Coleman and Hill, 2015; Thompson et al., 2016). Evidence suggests that up-regulation of EV secretion from neuronal cells enhances Aβ uptake into microglia and significantly decreases extracellular levels of Aβ (Yuyama et al., 2012), and injecting EVs into the brains of AD transgenic mice resulted in a significant reduction in the brain Aβ load (Yuyama et al., 2014). Secretion, particularly via EVs, has also been proposed as a toxicity attenuation mechanism by which excess tau is eliminated (Medina and Avila, 2014; Simon et al., 2012).

On the other hand, mounting evidence also suggests EVs have a role in spreading of pathological proteins in these CNS disorders (Coleman and Hill, 2015; Howitt and Hill, 2016; Thompson et al., 2016), though the evidence is far from conclusive in conditions other than the classic prion diseases (e.g., Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease) (Fevrier et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2016; Vella et al., 2008; Vella et al., 2007). In AD models, some cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Aβ peptides was found to occur on early endosomes, which subsequently resulted in the trafficking of Aβ to MVBs, and a minute fraction of Aβ was secreted into the extracellular space bound to EVs (Rajendran et al., 2006). Since this discovery, the full-length APP protein and many of its metabolites as well as tau have been found to be secreted into EVs (see reviews by (Howitt and Hill, 2016; Thompson et al., 2016)). Associations between EVs and amyloid plaque formation (Dinkins et al., 2014) or tau aggregate propagation (Polanco et al., 2016) have also been recently reported in vivo. In addition to AD and tauopathies, EVs are also reported to be associated with spreading neuropathological proteins in other neurological disorders, including α-synuclein in PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (Emmanouilidou et al., 2010; Grey et al., 2015; Ngolab et al., 2017; Stuendl et al., 2016), and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Feiler et al., 2015; Gomes et al., 2007; Grad et al., 2014).

3. Transportation of extracellular vesicles between the brain and peripheral blood

Although the evidence is still limited, studies have suggested that EVs may move from the brain to the systemic circulation. Earlier studies suggested that EVs may cross multiple layers of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011; Matsumoto et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2014), possibly by moving from cell to cell via the MVB compartment and endocytosis (Record et al., 2011). A more recent study confirmed that EVs derived from orthotopic xenotransplant of human glioma-cancer stem cells in mouse brain could cross intact BBB into the bloodstream (Garcia-Romero et al., 2017). This is in line with observations that EVs containing glioma-specific mRNA mutant/variants, microRNAs, and DNAs could be detected in peripheral serum of glioblastoma patients (Chen et al., 2013; Garcia-Romero et al., 2017; Noerholm et al., 2012; Skog et al., 2008). To isolate brain-derived EVs in peripheral blood for more general purposes, we recently introduced a method that targets L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), the founding member of a subfamily of cell adhesion molecules primarily expressed in the nervous system that is thought to be a surface marker of CNS-derived EVs (Faure et al., 2006; Kenwrick et al., 2000; Lachenal et al., 2011; Simpson et al., 2012). Moreover, radiolabeled α-synuclein or tau injected intracerebroventricularly in mouse brain can be readily transported into blood (Banks et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014; Sui et al., 2014), with a small portion contained in anti-L1CAM-captured EVs (Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014), suggesting that these CNS disorder-related proteins in brain could also be transported into peripheral blood via EVs. These findings suggest that CNS-derived EVs and their protein and nucleic acid cargos in peripheral blood could serve as potential biomarkers for brain disorders (see section 4 below). The underlying mechanisms of such EV efflux remain to be elucidated, but EVs could move from the CNS to the systemic circulation by direct translocation into capillaries or draining venules, or by passing through interstitial fluid into the CSF and — via the arachnoid granulations and perinasal lymphatics — into the venous system (Fig. 1) (Thompson et al., 2016).

4. Analyses of bloodborne, central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles

In addition to sparking interest in understanding the potential for EVs to serve as a vehicle for toxic protein clearance and/or brain-periphery communication, the finding that CNS EVs are transported from the brain to the blood led to significant interest in their use as a source of readily accessible CNS biomarkers. Development of traditional biochemical biomarkers for CNS disease has been challenging, due to the difficulty of identifying, isolating, and quantifying molecules that reflect the state of the brain without requiring invasive collection techniques (Keshavan et al., 2017). Use of brain-derived EVs sidesteps this problem, allowing targeting of circulating EVs carrying markers indicating their CNS origin, followed by quantification of their cargo (such as proteins and RNAs), that may be altered in disease states (see section 5 for more details). Extracting EVs from biofluids at the required purity and throughput, however, has been a major challenge (more detailed discussion in section 7 below). One development in this area is the affinity immuno-capture method, in which antibodies against surface markers are used to capture EVs and selection for a specific subpopulation of EVs can be achieved. This approach has been exploited to extract EVs that likely originate from the CNS in peripheral blood, using them to demonstrate that these CNS-derived EVs could serve as a pool of enriched biomarker candidates in a variety of CNS disorders (Table 1) (Abner et al., 2016; Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2015b; Goetzl et al., 2016a; Goetzl et al., 2016b; Goetzl et al., 2018b; Goetzl et al., 2016c; Hamlett et al., 2017; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Mustapic et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014; Winston et al., 2016).

4.1 Extracellular vesicle proteins in Alzheimer disease

In AD, Aβ peptide 1–42 (Aβ1–42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) not only play critical roles in the disease pathogenesis but are also considered the “core” AD biomarkers in CSF (Lleo et al., 2015). However, the performance of these proteins when measured in blood has been less consistent among studies and robust diagnostic or predictive blood markers for AD have yet to be identified (Henriksen et al., 2014). Goetzl and colleagues used neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) first and L1CAM (a probably more CNS-specific EVs surface marker) later to capture likely CNS-derived EVs from human serum or plasma in patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI or prodromal AD), and controls (Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2018a; Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2015b; Goetzl et al., 2016a; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Winston et al., 2016). The authors found that the EV levels of Aβ1–42, t-tau, and p-tau isoforms were significantly higher in AD patients compared to controls (Fiandaca et al., 2015), though the alterations in t-tau were disputed by later studies (Guix et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2016). Similar differences were found for progression from MCI (Winston et al., 2016) to dementia or even in pre-clinical cases up to 10 years before onset of AD (Fiandaca et al., 2015). In these studies, a two-step method – first precipitating total EVs with a commercial kit (ExoQuick®), then immunoprecipitating EVs that express L1CAM to generate a subpopulation enriched for EVs of neuronal origin – was used to isolate likely CNS-derived EVs from plasma/serum samples (Mustapic et al., 2017). Although this two-step method is intended to increase the isolation efficiency and purity, possible introduction of contaminating species during the procedure (e.g., use of non-purified thromboplastin-D derived from rabbit brain homogenates for plasma pre-treatment) should be considered and avoided.

In addition to these well-established AD pathogenic proteins, a similar approach has revealed altered levels of a number of proteins implicated in AD, such as phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) species, lysosomal proteins (e.g., cathepsin-D), heat shock proteins (e.g., HSP70), cellular survival factors (e.g., repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor or REST), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), synaptic proteins (e.g., neurogranin), and others in L1CAM-positive EVs in AD patients or subjects examined before the clinical onset of dementia (Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2015b; Goetzl et al., 2016a; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Mustapic et al., 2017). In particular, levels of phosphorylated IRS-1 species in EVs were found to be associated with regional brain atrophy in AD (Mullins et al., 2017). Furthermore, when glutamine aspartate transporter (GLAST) was used to enrich likely astrocyte-derived EVs in plasma, levels of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), soluble APP β (sAPPβ), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (Goetzl et al., 2016b), and complement effector proteins (Goetzl et al., 2018b) were found to be altered in the GLAST-positive EVs of patients with AD compared to controls, though the astrocytic origin of the GLAST-carrying EVs needs to be further confirmed. All of these results still require validation, but suggest the potential for a blood test to predict development of AD.

4.2 Extracellular vesicle proteins in Parkinson disease

As indicated in section 2 above, α-synuclein oligomerization and aggregation is thought to have a critical role in the etiology of PD (Thomas and Beal, 2007). Recent evidence, including the consistent association of the tau gene (MAPT) H1 haplotype with risk of PD (Simon-Sanchez et al., 2009; Zabetian et al., 2007), also suggests that tau plays a role in PD pathogenesis. Both CSF α-synuclein and tau are promising biomarker candidates for PD, while reports on the two proteins in blood are less consistent and promising (Lleo et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014). Their levels were assessed in likely CNS-originating L1CAM-containing EVs enriched from plasma of a large PD case-control sample cohort using the immunocapture technique mentioned at the beginning of section 4, which produces an EV sample minimizing contamination from non-EV-associated forms of the target analytes, such as free α-synuclein that is abundantly produced from red blood cells and platelets (Shi et al., 2014). The levels of L1CAM EV-contained α-synuclein and tau were substantially higher in PD patients, suggesting that efflux from the CNS to blood was higher for both proteins (Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014). Another important finding was that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity achieved by plasma EV-contained α-synuclein or tau were comparable to those of their counterpart CSF proteins, and significant associations between L1CAM EV-contained α-synuclein or tau and disease severity or duration were also observed (Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014).

4.3 Extracellular vesicle proteins in other central nervous system disorders

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common intellectual disability mediated by the trisomy of chromosome 21, and DS patients exhibit AD neuropathology and dementia early in life (Hamlett et al., 2017; Lockstone et al., 2007). Analysis of L1CAM-positive, likely CNS-derived EVs in plasma revealed that neuronal EV levels of Aβ1–42 and p-tau species were significantly elevated in individuals with DS compared with age-matched controls at all ages beginning in childhood (Hamlett et al., 2017). These early increases may provide a basis for early intervention as targeted treatments become available. In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), levels of Aβ1–42, one isoform of p-tau, REST, and some synaptic proteins in L1CAM-postive EVs were also found to be significantly altered compared to controls (Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2016a), suggesting that changes in the production and/or efflux of these CNS EV-contained proteins might be a common feature in different neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, subjects with aging-associated motor decline were also reported to have higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in circulating L1CAM-positive EVs (Suire et al., 2017). Furthermore, in plasma L1CAM-positive EVs from HIV seropositive individuals, significantly higher levels of high-mobility group box 1, neurofilament light chain, and Aβ proteins were found in cognitively impaired participants compared with neuropsychologically normal individuals, suggesting that these EVs and their protein cargo may be useful for following cognitive impairment and response to therapy in HIV infection (Sun et al., 2017).

4.4 Extracellular vesicle RNAs

Over the past decade, EVs have been shown to have crucial roles in cancer development, including premetastatic niche formation and metastasis (Xu et al., 2018). Cancer cells are now recognized to secrete more EVs than their nonmalignant counterparts, and these EVs carry molecules such as microRNAs, mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and other RNA species. Therefore, cancer EVs and their RNA cargos isolated from body fluids have strong potential as blood-based or urine-based biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognostication, and surveillance of cancer (Xu et al., 2018).

In patients with brain tumors (e.g., glioblastomas), as mentioned in section 3 above, EVs containing tumor-specific mRNAs and microRNAs could be detected in peripheral blood (Chen et al., 2013; Garcia-Romero et al., 2017; Noerholm et al., 2012; Skog et al., 2008), and their levels may potentially represent the key information in terms of tumor formation and progression, providing a non-invasive method in brain tumor diagnosis (Skog et al., 2008). The current literature on EV-specific RNAs as biomarkers of other CNS disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases is limited. Studies have identified altered expression of microRNAs in plasma EVs in AD (Cheng et al., 2015; Lugli et al., 2015), but RNAs in likely CNS-derived EVs in blood have yet to be investigated.

5. Translational potential of central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles in neurological disorder diagnosis

As more is learned about CNS-blood pathways and the characteristics of CNS-derived EVs in blood, new opportunities are arising in developing easy-to-access biomarker assays for CNS disorders (Fig. 2A). To date, the most consistent and best performing CNS disorder molecular markers have been found in the CSF, which is not an ideal biofluid for routine monitoring due to the invasive nature of sample collection by lumbar puncture. Because the collection of peripheral blood is considerably easier than CSF in routine clinical practice, defining circulating biomarkers in blood has numerous advantages. However, despite extensive research, robust diagnostic or predictive blood markers for these diseases remain elusive. Accurately detecting and quantifying those often extraordinarily low-abundance brain-derived or disease-specific proteins in blood is challenging for most current technologies. In this regard, several properties of EVs, particularly those transported from the brain to blood, make them excellent candidates for harboring biomarkers of CNS disorders. Their cargo of protein and nucleic acid is likely to reflect core pathogenic intracellular processes in their originating brain cells, in contrast to biofluids such as blood and CSF, in which the levels of relevant molecules are greatly diluted, and often masked, by the high concentration of less relevant substances, such as biomolecules from peripheral organs (Thompson et al., 2016).

Recent results from multiple laboratories (Table 1) have demonstrated the promise of utilizing CNS cell-specific EVs, which addresses both the problems of the complexity of blood and questions about how or whether blood proteins reflect the brain by specifically targeting proteins in brain-derived plasma EVs, as a platform for a liquid biopsy. In PD, elevated levels of α-synuclein and tau in likely CNS-derived EVs have been observed (Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014); although the assays did not achieve appropriate sensitivity or specificity for use in clinical diagnosis, they did show potential for further development (Thompson et al., 2016). Other findings hold promise for the development of a marker for early or prodromal AD pathology (Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2018a; Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2015b; Goetzl et al., 2016a; Goetzl et al., 2016b; Goetzl et al., 2018b; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Winston et al., 2016). Although these promising findings require further validation in larger independent cohorts, the approach opens a unique “window” into the brain.

6. Bi-directional transport of extracellular vesicles and the potential for extracellular vesicle-based therapies

In addition to transport of EVs from the brain to the blood, accumulating evidence also demonstrates that EVs cross the BBB from the blood to the brain. A recent study (Matsumoto et al., 2017) found that peripherally administered red blood cell-derived EVs could cross the BBB in mice, particularly under inflammatory conditions provoked by peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide, which is relevant in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. This transport likely occurs via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis, and EVs that transit the BBB co-localize with brain microglia following transport into the brain. In agreement with these results, another independent study also demonstrated that hematopoietic cell-derived EVs could transfer functional RNAs from blood to neurons in the brain (Ridder et al., 2014). Although this type of signaling was highly restricted in the healthy animal, inflammatory injuries increased both the frequency of transfer and the range of the neuronal target populations in the brain, suggesting a complex regulation of gene expression in neural cells in response to peripheral inflammation.

These findings raise the possibility that EVs might also prove useful in the development of new treatments for neurological disorders (Fig. 2B) (Lener et al., 2015), and, intriguingly, several studies have used this property of EVs in order to bypass the BBB for drug delivery. As EVs can be modified to carry both small and large molecules, they have the potential to transport bioactive molecules, including microRNAs, siRNAs, and bioactive proteins (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Sterzenbach et al., 2017), from the periphery into the brain. For example, intravenously injected EVs expressing a neuron-targeting peptide delivered a cargo of small interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically to neurons, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the brain, resulting in a specific gene knockdown in mice (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011). Such a strategy offers a number of advantages as a drug delivery system: EVs can overcome major limitations posed by the BBB and offer good biocompatibility, high targeting specificity, and low immunogenicity (Andaloussi S et al., 2013). Several preclinical studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of EVs in CNS disorders. For example, EV-mediated siRNA delivery has been used to diminish expression of key therapeutic targets for AD (BACE1, a protease that initiates Aβ production by cleaving amyloid precursor protein) and PD (α-synuclein) in mouse models (Alvarez-Erviti et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 2014). More recently, it was reported that engineered exosome producer cells subcutaneously implanted in living mice could consistently deliver cargo mRNA to the brain, and therapeutic catalase mRNA delivery by designer exosomes attenuated neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation in in vitro and in vivo models of PD (Kojima et al., 2018).

Additionally, endogenous EVs may themselves carry cargos with potential therapeutic properties (Lener et al., 2015). EVs derived from a variety of stem cell types are thought to contain factors that exert regenerative effects (Han et al., 2016). For example, systemic administration of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived EVs improved functional recovery in rat models of traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, and stroke by enhancing angiogenesis, promoting neurogenesis, and/or reducing inflammation (Huang et al., 2017; Xin et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). Identifying and harnessing the molecules contained within these EVs that are responsible for the beneficial effects observed could prove valuable in creating neuroprotective therapies.

7. Current challenges in analyzing central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles

7.1 Specificity of likely central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles.

To examine CNS-derived EVs in peripheral blood, CNS- or brain cell-specific EV markers are needed. L1CAM, developed by our group (Shi et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2014) and adopted by others (Abner et al., 2016; Fiandaca et al., 2015; Goetzl et al., 2018a; Goetzl et al., 2015a; Goetzl et al., 2015b; Goetzl et al., 2016a; Goetzl et al., 2016b; Goetzl et al., 2016c; Hamlett et al., 2017; Kapogiannis et al., 2015; Mustapic et al., 2017; Winston et al., 2016), is probably the best studied CNS EV surface marker to date. Recent proteomic studies demonstrated that L1CAM-containing EVs in plasma have higher concentrations of several markers (e.g., phosphorylated tau, neuron-specific enolase, microtubule associated protein 2, neurofilament light chain, and L1CAM) that are reasonably specific to neurons compared to total plasma EVs (Mustapic et al., 2017), highly suggesting the neuronal (and, to some degree, CNS) origin of these EVs. However, L1CAM is also known to be expressed in certain cancer and specialized cells, including some kidney cells (Kenwrick et al., 2000). Although there is no evidence indicating that L1CAM-containing EVs are secreted from kidney and other peripheral cell types, the CNS- or neuron- specificity of L1CAM-containing EVs in blood needs to be further investigated. Other CNS-specific EV surface markers, including those from different brain cell types (astrocytes, microglia, and neurons) and those from different brain regions that are affected in different neurological disorders, should also be explored to identify biomarker candidates that are more specific to each disease. Thus far, NCAM has been tested (Fiandaca et al., 2015), though it seems to be less CNS-specific than L1CAM. Additionally, GLAST has been utilized to study astrocyte-derived EVs in blood (Goetzl et al., 2016b; Goetzl et al., 2018b), but its CNS- or astrocyte-specificity has not been rigorously tested.

7.2 Isolation of relatively pure extracellular vesicles for high yield of biomarkers.

EV isolation and characterization remain challenging due to the presence of contaminants with comparable features (Mateescu et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016). A major challenge in profiling circulating EVs is that differential centrifugation (plus density gradient for purer preparations) is still the “gold” standard, and one of the most frequently used methods for EVs isolation from body fluids (Mateescu et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016). While effective for general EV preparations, the methodology is cumbersome, requires a large amount of starting material, and is not suitable for high-throughput assays, nor does it provide EV subpopulation (e.g., those containing CNS-specific markers) and individual particle analysis. This method also suffers from generating EV preparations that contain many different types of EVs and even free protein aggregates large enough to be sedimented at the given centrifugal forces (Mateescu et al., 2017; Sodar et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2016). Multiple alternative approaches have been developed (Table 2; see also articles summarizing the current state of knowledge for EV isolation (Mateescu et al., 2017; Minciacchi et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016)). Mostly polymer-based commercial precipitation products (e.g., Exoquick®) can quickly precipitate EVs from biological fluids (Coumans et al., 2017; Weng et al., 2016), but suffer similar limitations, in that the resulting pellets are likely contaminated with other particles, large aggregates, associating proteins, etc. (Van Deun et al., 2014). Most studies on CNS-derived EVs in blood have improved on these strategies by utilizing the affinity immunocapture method for EV isolation, which can generate relatively pure EVs, but the yield is usually low (Mustapic et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2016). Studies (Fiandaca et al., 2015; Mustapic et al., 2017) have been conducted to combine polymer–based precipitation followed by immunocapture to improve yield and purity, but introduction of contaminants during the process is still a concern (Shi et al., 2016).

7.3 Quantification of extremely low abundance central nervous system-derived extracellular vesicles cargos in blood.

The use of blood EVs to yield clinically useful biomarkers for CNS disorders is also hampered by the small numbers of CNS-derived EVs that are secreted by disease-relevant cells and transported into peripheral blood. These difficulties are exacerbated by the complexity and technical limitations of current EV extraction methods in terms of EV yield and purity as mentioned in section 7.2 above. Sensitive assays are needed to quantify the cargos, particularly proteins, in these CNS-derived EVs in blood. For example, measuring tau in L1CAM-containing EVs in plasma (Shi et al., 2016) necessitated the use of newly developed immunoassay technology: Single Molecule Array (Simoa), which makes use of arrays of femtoliter-sized reaction chambers to isolate and detect single protein molecules (Rissin et al., 2011; Rissin et al., 2010). More sensitive and accurate technologies are still needed to analyze individual EVs and their cargos.

8. Next generation tools for extracellular vesicle analysis and future directions

Given the lack of robust and efficient methods to isolate relatively pure EVs and the difficulties involved in quantifying the cargos (particularly proteins), several recent studies have focused on developing novel approaches to purify EVs and analyze individual particles in a more rapid, sensitive, and accurate manner. By using microfluidic devices and trapping EVs with an immune-affinity approach, sophisticated platforms involving on-chip isolation, quantification and characterization (ExoChip) (Kanwar et al., 2014), immunomagnetic exosome RNA (iMER) analysis (Shao et al., 2015), miniaturized micro–nuclear magnetic resonance (μNMR) microfluidic chip system (Shao et al., 2012), and label-free high-throughput nano-plasmonic exosome assay (nPLEX) using surface plasmon resonance (Im et al., 2014) have been developed to analyze EVs from blood, though these platforms need to be further improved to extend small-scale EV research into high-throughput, routine research and clinical settings.

Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which allows direct and individual visualization of specific EVs in liquid suspension in real-time and provides size distribution profiles and concentration measurements, has been widely employed in the field. However, NTA faces several limitations, particularly when used for examining particles in biofluids. First, NTA measures particles based on their Brownian movement, and cannot distinguish EVs from other particles. Second, the technology was developed based on monodisperse particle suspensions, and may not perform optimally on the widely variable particles present in biofluids. To overcome these drawbacks for measuring EVs in body fluids, this technology can also include fluorescent detection (e.g., using fluorescent antibodies against EV surface markers) and thus enables phenotyping of the particles (Dragovic et al., 2011). However, simultaneous measurements of scatter and fluorescence or multiple fluorescent signals are currently unavailable.

Flow cytometric analysis of EVs has also made significant advances. This technology in general cannot detect and quantify particles smaller than 200 nm. Recently, the use of microflow technologies (Apogee) has enabled the direct analysis of EVs as small as ~150 nm (Kibria et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2016). The inclusion of fluorescent detection with small and wide-angle scatter enables microflow technologies to interrogate each particle with fluorescent antibodies, thereby bringing the advantages of traditional flow cytometry to the analysis of EVs and enabling simultaneous measurements of multiple surface markers and even internal markers on a single EV (Minciacchi et al., 2017).

Unfortunately, most of these methods have not been standardized, which makes cross-assay comparisons difficult. It has also prevented the field from specifically defining what EV population has been studied by different investigators. Moving forward, in addition to recently proposed minimal experimental requirements, assay standardization, and transparent reporting (Lener et al., 2015; Lotvall et al., 2014; Mateescu et al., 2017; Van Deun et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2016), we recommend the following: Identify EV surface markers that are more CNS-specific or specific to brain cell subpopulations or regions: One can hypothesize that the changes in EV efflux occur even more prominently in the brain regions or cell types/subpopulations specifically affected by various CNS disorders. Thus, identifying more specific EV surface markers could have major impact in this field.

Combine current EV isolation technologies for better yield and purity: Until a robust technology or assay is developed, it may be a good strategy to combine the immunocapture method with another method to improve target EV yield and purity. For example, a crude preparation step (e.g., filtering, precipitation, or size-exclusion chromatography) may be added before immunocapture, or a concentrating or further purification step added after immunocapture.

Further develop new technologies for analyzing individual EVs and their cargos: Accurately and reliably analyzing individual EVs with multiple markers (surface and internal) would have numerous advantages, including much reduced contaminating signal/noise, better assessment of the variability, likely reduced sample material requirement, and easier targeting of EV subpopulations. For the last point, many neurological disorders progress through multiple stages, affecting preferentially different regions of the brain (e.g., hippocampus for AD, midbrain for PD) at least at early stages of the diseases, and consequently the cargo in EVs derived from disease-related brain regions or neuronal subpopulations may be more effective and specific disease biomarkers. Therefore, as a good example, EVs carrying both L1CAM and another marker specific to an AD-related brain region or neuronal subpopulation could be a much better source of effective AD biomarkers in blood than L1CAM-positive EVs in general.

9. Concluding remarks

Brain-derived EVs identified in peripheral blood have shown great potential to harbor disease-specific molecular signatures of CNS disorders, making them an ideal source of biomarkers. Further work is underway to develop techniques that enable high-yield capture of relevant EV populations that are more likely to contain relevant candidate markers and to validate the acquired preliminary results in larger independent cohorts. Keys to success will be the confirmation of the CNS (cell subpopulation or brain region) specificity as well as standardization of EV purification and analysis. Using EVs as novel therapeutic vehicles is also under intensive investigation. This line of research will likely provide easily accessible biomarkers to aid in diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and assess treatment effects, and create novel treatment strategies and drug delivery systems for CNS disorders.

Highlights

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and (shedding) microvesicles, play critical roles in normal central nervous system (CNS) function and neurological disorders.

EVs may travel between the CNS and peripheral circulation.

Brain-derived EVs found in peripheral blood contain molecular signatures (proteins, RNAs, etc.) specific to the cells of origin and have potential clinical utility as biomarkers for CNS disorders.

Modified EVs have potential as vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic agents into the CNS.

Further development, optimization, and standardization of EV isolation and analysis techniques are required to enable interlaboratory data comparison and for the advancement of their clinical utility.
