Background:

Hippocampal place cells play an integral role in generating spatial maps. Impaired spatial memory is a characteristic pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet it remains unclear how AD influences the properties of hippocampal place cells.

Objective:

To record electrophysiological activity in hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely-moving 18-month-old male TgF344-AD and age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates to examine place cell properties.

Methods:

We implanted 32-channel electrode arrays into the CA1 subfield of 18-month-old male WT and TgF344-AD (n=6/group) rats. Ten days after implantation, single unit activity in an open field arena was recorded across days. The spatial information content, in-field firing rate, and stability of each place cell was compared across groups. Pathology was assessed by immunohistochemical staining, and a deep neural network approach was used to count cell profiles.

Results:

Aged TgF344-AD rats exhibited hippocampal amyloid-β deposition, and a significant increase in Iba1 immunoreactivity and microglia cell counts. Place cells from WT and TgF344-AD rat showed equivalent spatial information, in-field firing rates, and place field stability when initially exposed to the arena. However, by day 3, the place cells in aged WT rats showed characteristic spatial tuning as evidenced by higher spatial information content, stability, and in-field firing rates, an effect not seen in TgF344-AD rats.

Conclusion:

These findings support the notion that altered electrophysiological properties of place cells may contribute to the learning and memory deficits observed in AD.

One of the earliest signs of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a loss of spatial memory [1]. Several studies have shown that spatial memory is encoded within the hippocampus, where the coordinated action of place cells integrate information about the local space, giving rise to a cognitive map [2]. Mutant mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) [3, 4] show age-related memory deficits that are associated with impairments in place cell function [5, 6]. Similarly, Tau-based animal models of AD can also exhibit impaired place cell function [7, 8]. Rats have been the predominant animal model used for investigating place cell activity [9, 10]. However, experimental AD research largely employs mouse models, with only a limited number of studies carried out using transgenic rats [11-13]. A rat model of AD expressing mutant forms of both the human APP and PS1 genes has been developed (TgF344-AD), which exhibits aging-related amyloidosis, cognitive dysfunction and gliosis. Unlike some of the transgenic mouse models that also overproduce amyloid [14, 15], this rat strain also produces tauopathy and neuronal losspathologies that mimic AD [11, 16]. Using this rat model, a previous study found that while place cells in the CA3 and CA2 subfields had altered properties, the properties of place cells in the CA1 subfield remained normal in a cohort of 12 to 20 month old female animals [17]. Considering the well-established role of CA1 place cells in spatial memory formation [18-20], this negative finding warrants independent examination. In our experimental approach, we focused on investigating the properties of CA1 place cells in a more age-restricted cohort (18 to 20 months) of male TgF344-AD and WT rats, and analyzed data longitudinally over three days of recording. Our results indicate that CA1 place cells in WT animals exploring an open field arena formed discrete place fields which sharpened over a three-day testing period. In contrast, CA1 place cells in TgF344-AD rats did not increase their spatial information content over time, had reduced in-field firing rates, and had less stable place fields. These results indicate that impaired CA1 place cell properties may contribute to spatial impairments in this rat model of AD.

Methods

All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the recommendations provided in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Protocols were designed to minimize pain and discomfort during the surgical procedures and recovery. For neurophysiology experiments, we implanted 18-20 month-old male TgF344-AD rats and WT F344 littermates (n=6/group) with 32-channel electrode arrays (Bio-Signal, Dallas, TX). Since the initial assessment of this transgenic line showed no sex-related behavioral differences [11], we elected to perform these experiments in only male as we have extensive experience testing male rats in variety of behavioral tasks. Following a 2 week convalescent period, a 32-channel unity gain head stage was used to record spiking activity from individual CA1 neurons in the pyramidal cell layer using a Blackrock microsystems data acquisition system (Blackrock microsystems, Salt Lake City, Utah).

Electrode implant surgery

Full details of the surgical technique have been reported previously [21]. Briefly, WT and TgF344-AD rats (n=6/group) were deeply anesthetized using 5% isoflurane with a 1:1 air/O2 mixture, and a surgical level of anesthesia was maintained using 2.5% isoflurane. Rats were mounted on a stereotaxic frame, the scalp incised, and a craniectomy was made 3.8 mm posterior to bregma and 2.0 lateral to the midline. Electrodes were lowered ~ 2.2 mm (unit activity was monitored during placement), then fixed in place using dental cement. The skin was sutured and topical analgesic and antibiotic ointment (Neosporin plus) applied for 7 days following implantation to minimize pain and risk of infection.

Neurophysiological Recordings during open field exploration

Following a week of convalescence, we connected rats to a Blackrock Cereplex neurophysiology recording suite and placed them in a 60 cm x 60 cm open field arena with internal and external cues. We recorded 20 minute sessions daily for 3 consecutive days. Spiking data were sampled at 30 kHz, digitally filtered (250 Hz hi-pass filter) and thresholds set to 50-80 μV. Spikes were sorted using a manual clustering program (Blackrock Offline Spike Sorter) based on peak amplitude, spike width, valley amplitude, area, and principal components 1-4. An infrared tracking system (Neuromotive, Blackrock microsystems) was used to follow the real-time movement of the animals in the open field arena, and the tracking data was sampled at 40 Hz with a resolution of ~0.2 cm.

For recording spatial activity, videos of the arena were pixelated into 3 cm x 3 cm bins and the number of spikes in each bin was divided by the time spent within that bin to determine a firing rate. The firing rates within the individual bins were combined to generate a heat map for each neuron’s activity within the entire open field. Spatial information (SI) is a measure of how unambiguously the cell’s firing reflects the position of the animal. SI was calculated according to Skaggs et al. [22], with neurons exhibiting an SI &gt; 0.99 classified as place cells. SI was calculated according to Skagg et al. [22], using the equation: SI=∑i=1Npi(RiR)log2(RiR)

Where pi = the probability the rat was at spatial bin i (out of N bins), Ri = firing rate at spatial bin i, and R = overall firing rate of the place cell [22]. Neurons with an SI &gt; 0.99 were considered to be place cells.

To determine place field size, we used the criteria of Muller et al [23]: a group of adjoining bins (sharing at least one side) with the average firing rate of each bin &gt; 10% above the mean firing rate of each cell [24, 25]. To reduce the false positive rate, we used a 1 sec minimum threshold for occupancy. Fields with fewer than 6 adjacent bins, or larger than 55 bins (500 cm2) were also excluded.

Place field stability was determined by tracking the firing rate within a place field of a specific place cell, first by selecting only the place cells based on SI score, and then comparing the first five minutes and the final five minutes of the exploration time within that field. Stability was assessed using a Pearson’s correlation coefficient as described previously [8, 21]. Population values on each day were statistically compared using a single factor ANOVA, and a nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the properties of place cells.

Immunohistochemistry and quantification

Animals were euthanized by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), transcardially perfused with 300 mL of ice-cold saline followed by 300 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, then post-fixed at 4° C for an additional 24 h. After cryoprotection in PBS containing 30% sucrose, the contralateral hemispheres were embedded in OCT and 10 μm slide-mounted sagittal sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry (Histoserv, Germantown, MD). Multiplex immunohistochemistry was carried out using antibodies directed against NeuN (Millipore, cat. 234004), GFAP (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, custom-made), Iba1 (Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany, cat. 234004), S100 (Abcam, cat. ab14849), histones (a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies detecting Histone 2a/2b/4 from MBL International: cat. D210-3, D212-3, D214-3, and Histone 3 from Millipore, cat. 05-1341), and human Aβ (Abcam, cat. ab126649) as has been previously described [26]. Briefly, sections were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.5% Triton-X100, blocked with FcBlocker (Innovex, NB309) and Background Buster (Innovex, NB306), and then incubated overnight at room temperature with a cocktail of primary antibodies at 1 μg/μl each. Sections were washed, incubated 3 hr with compatible secondary antibodies coupled to AlexaFluor dyes, washed again, dried and coverslipped with Prolong Gold. Images of brain sections were captured using a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanning microscope equipped with an X-Cite XYLIS LED light source using acquisition parameters that were kept constant for each multiplex panel. Initial tile stitching and shading corrections were performed online using Zen Blue (version 2.6). Cell profile counts for CA1 neurons (NeuN+), and hippocampal microglia (Iba1+) and astrocytes (s100+) were performed using a deep neural network-based tissue mapping toolkit [27]. Images were computationally processed to reject autofluorescence, imaging noise, and fluorescent bleedthrough, resulting in the isolation of the specific fluorescent signals of interest. Next, deep neural networks used the DAPI+ and histone+ signals in the image for cell detection and segmentation. Finally, cell phenotyping and quantification for the specific markers of interest were performed based on prior neural network training to identify neurons, microglia and astrocytes [27]. Fluorescence intensity quantification was performed on the original greyscale images without prior adjustments essentially as previously described by us [28, 29]. For Iba1, s100, and Aβ fluorescence intensity quantification, the hippocampus was traced in ImageJ and the off-target fluorescence intensity (average intensity using regions without specific signal) for each fluorochrome was measured for each section in a group, averaged, and subtracted from the target signal. The corrected fluorescent intensity was then averaged across each animal per group and presented as the percent mean ± standard error using the wild-type animals as reference. To calculate the percent hippocampal area showing Aβ staining we used ImageJ. A threshold value was determined using a representative sham image, and then applied to all the images. The hippocampal area with Aβ signal above the threshold was divided by the total hippocampal area to yield the % area.

Results

In order to assess hippocampal pathology of 18 month-old TgF344-AD rats, we used a multiplex immunohistochemistry approach to assess Aß accumulation and glial inflammation, key pathologies in the progression of AD. Representative photomicrographs from 18-month-old WT and TgF344-AD rats are shown in Figure 1. By comparison to WT rats (Figure 1A,C-E), there was an obvious accumulation of Aβ plaques in the aged transgenic animals (Figure 1B, F-H). We found a significant increase in overall Aβ fluorescent intensity in the hippocampus (WT 100.00% ± 6.85%, TgF344-AD 276.67% ± 34.95%; P = 0.03, data not shown), and a corresponding significant increase total hippocampal surface area showing Aβ plaque staining (WT 0.061% ± 0.060% ; TgF344-AD 15.804% ± 3.239%; P = 0.03, data not shown). There was also a significant increase in Iba1 fluorescent signal intensity (WT 100.00% ± 9.61%, TgF344-AD 144.58% ± 10.57%; P = 0.04, data not shown), although no significant difference in S100 fluorescent intensity was detected in the hippocampus (WT 100.00% ± 16.38%, TgF344-AD 90.84% ± 24.77%; P = 0.77). To corroborate and extend these findings, we used an unbiased deep neural network approach to count cell profiles [27]. We detected a small, though insignificant decrease in NeuN+ neurons in the CA1 cell layer (Figure 1I; WT 915 ± 211, TgF344-AD 628 ± 54; P = 0.24), a significant increase in the number of hippocampal Iba1+ microglia (Figure 1J; WT 534 ± 42, TgF344-AD 889 ± 79; P = 0.01), and no change in the number of S100+ astrocytes (Figure 1K; WT 1029 ± 88, TgF344-AD 1051 ± 120; P = 0.89), consistent with fluorescent intensity findings.

We next tested whether CA1 place cell function remained intact as has been previously reported [17]. WT and TgF344-AD rats (n=6/group, male) to a novel open field arena while electrical activity was recorded during free exploration. Figure 2A shows representative heat maps of CA1 hippocampal place fields recorded over the course of the three-day testing period. In aged WT rats, the place fields of identified place cells (tracked daily by comparing their waveform properties, firing rate, and autocorrelation plots) sharpen over days of exposure to the same arena, resulting in increased SI content and higher in-field firing rates. By comparison, place cells from TgF344-AD rats do not increase their SI content or in-field firing rates over the three-day testing period.

To quantify these differences, we examined the mean SI content and firing rates of place cells within each day’s exposure to the testing arena. Because there is uncertainty in recording from the same neurons every day, we evaluated the spatial information of each unit daily, and they were classified accordingly. This resulted in slight differences in the number of neurons characterized as place cells from day to day. We found that by day 3, WT place cells had significantly higher SI relative to TgF344-AD place cells (Figure 2B, Table 1). Our data showed that the in-field firing rate recorded from WT animals was also significantly greater on day 3 relative to TgF344-AD animals (Figure 2C, Table 1).

When examined as a whole, the SI values from all of the units (including non-place cells) recorded from WT animals had a significantly higher group mean SI than the units recorded from TgF344-AD animals (Supplemental Figure 1), possibly due to an increased proportion of cells demonstrating place properties (24/234 WT units had SI values &gt; 0.99 (10.2%), whereas 19/276 TgF344-AD units had place fields (6.8%)).

To assess place field stability within each 20 minute daily recording session, we selected place cells that had SI &lt; 0.99 and defined the shape of the place field using the firing rate recorded during the entire session. The rate maps within the identified place field were then correlated between the start and finish of the testing session (Figure 3A,B). On day 3, WT place cells had significantly more stable fields than TgF344-AD animals (Figure 3C, WT: 0.42±0.03, TgF344-AD: 0.19±0.04 Mann Whitney U = 41, p&lt;0.05).

Discussion

Previous studies have demonstrated that while place fields initially emerge within minutes after rodents are placed into a novel open field, place cells remain plastic over time and refine their firing patterns upon repeated exposures to an environment [30-32]. Our results show that although CA1 place cells in 18 month old TgF344-AD rats initially have similar properties to those observed in aged WT rats, their ability to subsequently refine their firing properties (e.g. stabilize their place fields, increase their SI content, increase their in-field firing rate) is impaired. These data suggest that, although hippocampal neurons from WT and TgF344-AD animals have a similar ability to produce a spatial map when first introduced to an environment, the TgF344-AD neurons are impaired in their ability to refine this map as the rat re-explores the same environment.

The above results are in contrast to a previous study which reported that the TgF344-AD rats do not have impairments in CA1 place fields [17]. There are three differences in the studies which may account for this discrepancy. First, in the previous report, the days of exploration were not analyzed individually, and thus training-related differences may not have been captured between multiple sessions. Second, the animals used in the previous report spanned 12 to 20 months in age, while our experimental animals were 18 to 20 months, and therefore likely had a higher disease burden. Third, we used male rather than female rats, raising the possibility of a sex difference in aged TgF344-AD rats.

The hippocampus produces a cognitive map that is required for both navigation and memory, and the subfields comprising the trisynaptic loop of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus, the CA3, and the CA1 each subserve a different function [33-35]. Input from the association cortex to the entorhinal cortex synapses onto dentate gyrus granule neurons, which have been proposed to perform pattern separation [36-39]. The sparsely firing granule cells in the dentate gyrus synapse onto large CA3 pyramidal neurons, that have strong recurrent connections that are important for pattern completion [40-43]. The bursty pyramidal neurons of the CA3 then converge via the Schaffer Collaterals onto CA1 pyramidal neurons with modifiable, and thus dynamic synapses . In addition, the CA1 receives direct synaptic input, (approximately 1/3 of synaptic connections) from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant pathway [44]. These direct pathway projections are less modifiable, and are proposed to produce memory recall [45]. In models of Alzheimer’s disease, this trisynaptic circuit is compromised, with evidence indicating that soluble aβ oligomers produce synaptic degradation [46, 47]. Also, recent evidence indicates grid cells within the entorhinal cortex are impaired in AD, producing impairment of place cell representation of space [48].

While the reason for the inability of CA1 place cells in the TgF344-AD animals to refine their properties is unknown at present, healthy brain activity requires a complex equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission (E/I). The introduction of soluble Aβ oligomers can produce an imbalance in E/I in favor of excitation [49]. When recording from individual neurons, soluble oligomers produced a three-fold increase in excitatory tone, while decreasing inhibitory tone by half [50]. On a mechanistic level, the excitatory neurotransmitter receptor subunit AMPA GluA1 is upregulated in AD patients compared to healthy controls [51]. In addition, exogenous application of Aβ has been shown to initiate GABA receptor internalization [52], with additional studies indicating oligomer-induced GABAergic interneuron loss [53-56] and dysfunction [57]. It is possible the elevated basal firing rate we observed in the TgF344-AD rats (see Supplemental Figure 1) may result from an imbalance in E/I currents within the CA1, and may contribute to their impaired ability to enhance experience-dependent spatial information content. Additional experimentation will be required to investigate this possibility.

In summary, the TgF344-AD model reproduces some of the key pathologies of AD. Here we demonstrate that CA1 place cells from 18 to 20 month old male TgF344-AD rats have less spatial information content, and are not stable over repeated exposures to the same open field arena. This rat model may be useful, in conjunction with related mouse AD models, to study neuronal pathophysiology in AD, and provide an opportunity to test potential therapies.

Figure 2. Place fields in WT and TgF-344AD animals.

A) The heat maps of the firing rate of three place cells from WT animals and three place cells from TgF344-AD animals. Although the same cell cannot be reliably identified from one day to the next, the graphs show data recorded from the same electrode in each rat. Blue represents no firing in the heat map, warmer colors represent higher firing rates. Two of the cells from the WT group show consistent place field properties in the same location of the arena for three days. Cell 3 represents a cell that gains SI on day 3 and is classified as a place cell. By contrast, SI values of place cells in TgF344-AD animals had not changed by day 3. B) Summary results for SI values from place cells indicate that on day 3, place cells from Aged WT had significantly higher SI than TgF344-AD counterparts (Wilcoxon sum-rank test (p&lt;0.01). C) In-field firing rate, a measure of the intensity of spiking of a place cell within the place field, was increased in aged WT had higher in-field firing rates on D3 compared to TgF344-AD (p&lt;0.01).
