OBJECTIVE

To examine longitudinal race and sex differences in mid-life brain health and to evaluate whether cardiovascular health (CVH) or apolipoprotein-ε4 (APOEε4) explain differences.

METHODS

The study included 478 Black and White participants (mean age: 50 years). Total (TBV), Gray (GMV), White (WMV) and White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes and GM-cerebral blood flow (CBF) were acquired with 3T-MRI at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Analyses were based on general linear models.

RESULTS

There were race*sex interactions for GMV (P-interaction=0.004) and CBF (P-interaction=0.01) such that men showed more decline than women, and this was most evident in Blacks. Blacks compared to Whites had a significantly greater increase in WMH (P=0.002). All sex-race differences in change were marginally attenuated by CVH and APOEε4.

CONCLUSION

Race-sex differences in brain health emerge by mid-life. Identifying new environmental factors beyond CVH is needed to develop early interventions to maintain brain health.

pmc1. Background

Atrophy of brain tissue, white matter disease, and lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) are adverse sentinel cerebral changes that precede dementia.[1, 2] Studies of older persons suggest sex and race differences in the prevalence of these brain changes[3–7] and the likelihood of developing dementia.[8–11]

To meet national goals to prevent dementia, studies are needed to prospectively document early changes in brain health and to identify those who may be at risk for later cognitive impairment.[12] A growing body of evidence suggests that preventable cardiovascular risk factors are associated with an increase in white matter hyperintensities (WMH),[4, 6] cerebral atrophy, cerebral hypoperfusion,[13] and dementia.[14] Differences in mid-life cardiovascular risk[15, 16] by race and sex/gender are well known and may explain differences in brain health at an older age. Additionally, there may be differences in the frequency or biologic context of the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele,[12, 17] a genetic susceptibility risk factor for dementia.

There are few prospective studies that can examine early race and sex differences in brain health. Based on a bi-racial community-based cohort we examine these differences in 5-year change in MRI markers of brain health, and whether the burden of cardiovascular risk factors accounts for these differences. In secondary analyses we investigated whether presence of the APOE ε4 modifies race-sex differences in brain health, and whether differences are reflected in cognitive function. Given differences in the burden of cardiovascular risk factors and APOE ε4 carriership we hypothesize differences among sex-race groups in brain health.

2. Methods

2.1 Study population

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a bi-racial longitudinal study initiated to investigate the development and determinants of (sub) clinical cardiovascular disease beginning in young adulthood.[18] Black and White participants between the ages of 18–30 years were recruited from 4 sites in the US in 1985–1986 to achieve a balanced distribution by sex, age, education, and race. The CARDIA Brain MRI sub-study targeted 700 individuals balanced by sex and race and recruited from 3 CARDIA field centers (Birmingham, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Oakland, California) at the 25-year follow-up in 2010–2011 (mean participant age = 50.4 (SD 3.5) years, range 43–56 years) and repeated 5.0 years (SD 0.42 yrs.) later. Exclusion criteria included MRI contra-indications or a body size too large for the MRI scanner.

2.2 Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

The MRI protocol for the CARDIA Brain MRI Sub-study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of the University of Alabama Birmingham, the University of Minnesota, Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), the University of Pennsylvania, and the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research Protection for the Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Aging. All participants signed a separate written informed consent for the CARDIA Brain MRI Sub-study.

2.3 MRI acquisition and processing

Multimodal brain MRI scans were acquired on 3T MRI scanners (including a Siemens 3T Tim Trio (VB 15 platform) scanner at the Minneapolis and Oakland and a Philips 3T Achieva (2.6.3.6 platform) scanner in the Birmingham center. At each MRI field center trained technologists followed standard quality assurance protocols including scanning of phantoms previously developed for the Functional Bioinformatics Research Network (FBIRN) and the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The CARDIA MRI protocol consists of sagittal T1, T2, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) to assess volumes and pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) to assess cerebral blood flow (CBF). Appendix A provides a description of MRI acquisition and image analyses, which have been previously described.[19–21]

In this analysis we examined volumes of total brain (TBV), total gray matter (GMV), total normal white matter (WMV) and abnormal WMV, referred to white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume. We report on CBF in GM, as the pCASL sequence is not accurate in WM.[22]

2.4 Demographics, cardiovascular health (CVH), cognition and APOE*4 covariates

Participant self-identified race (non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White) and sex, as well as education (years) were assessed by questionnaire.[18, 23] To examine the effect of CVH on sex and race differences we chose the American Heart Association scale of cardiovascular health Simple-7 (CVH-LS7). This scale has been developed as a metric for public health messages about heart health.[24] In cross-sectional analyses the CVH-LS7 are positively associated with better cognitive test scores[25] and MRI outcomes[26] in the CARDIA cohort. The scale is based on the following: Blood pressure was measured 3 times 1 minute apart, with a sphygmomanometer (Omron HEM-907XL; Online Fitness, Santa Monica, CA) on the right arm of a seated participant; the average of the second and third measurement was used for analysis. Fasting blood was used to obtain fasting glucose, which was measured with hexokinase coupled to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Linco Research, St Louis, MO,) and total cholesterol.[27] Use of medication for high blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes was based on self-administered questionnaires.[18] Physical activity, quantified as a score based on the CARDIA Physical Activity History questionnaire, was assessed as the time spent per week in 8 vigorous intensity and 5 moderate intensity sport-related activities over the past year.[28] Smoking status is based on self-report. Body Mass Index calculated from measured body weight and height (kg/m2). Diet was quantified with the dietary assessment at Y20. This was based on a 28-day food consumption pattern measured with an interviewer-administered diet history questionnaire specifically developed for the CARDIA study.[29, 30] Specific coding for the CVH-LS-7 is described in Appendix B.[24]

For cognitive analyses, psychomotor speed was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST),[31] with higher scores for digits correctly substituted indicating better function. Verbal memory was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), with higher scores after a 10-minute delay indicating better function.[32] Executive function was defined by the Stroop interference test, with higher interference scores indicating worse function.[33] ApoE isoform (2,3,4) was determined in plasma collected at the 7-year follow-up exam. This assay, previously describe by Kamboh et al,[34] has a 96% concordance with genotype.[35]

2.5 Analytical sample

A total of 488 participants in the CARDIA Brain MRI Sub-study had baseline and follow-up MRI scans.[18] For longitudinal volumetric analyses, 10 participants were excluded due to processing failure (either related to image quality or the presence of a structural lesion) leaving 478 participants (Birmingham n=105, Minneapolis n=189, Oakland n=184). Compared to those with two scans, those with only one MRI scan were less likely to have ideal CVH-LS7 levels of smoking, BMI, blood pressure, or glucose and had less years of education (Supplementary Table e-1). The Birmingham site had the largest proportion of Black participants, otherwise sex and age distributions were similar across centers (Table e-2). For longitudinal CBF analyses, 189 scans acquired at the Minneapolis site were excluded due to technical incompatibilities in pCASL acquisitions at follow-up. After visual inspection of the pCASL mean CBF maps 29 were excluded due to various artifacts, including failed linear alignment (n=1), and low quality of CBF data (defined as a score &lt;0.5 on an empirical threshold for CBF data quality, n=35), leaving 235 for CBF analyses (59 from Birmingham and 176 from Oakland). See Table e-3 for final sample sizes of volumetric and CBF measures by race-sex groups.

2.6 Statistical analyses

Cerebral volumes were expressed in percentage of intracranial volume (GMV+WMV+WMH+ cerebral spinal fluid; ICV) to correct for head size; CBF is measured as ml/100g/min. To normalize the distribution of WMH we applied inverse hyperbolic sine transformation ‘asinh’ [f(x)=log(x+( x2+1)0.5], which is similar to a log transformation but can accommodate values of zero. Sex and race differences in baseline demographic and health characteristics were compared using ANOVA for continuous and Chi-square for categorical variables. Differences in MRI features between baseline and follow-up were tested with a paired sample t-test.

Adjusted group differences in change of MRI features were tested using a ‘residualised change approach’ where the follow-up MRI feature is the dependent variable, and the baseline MRI is included as an independent variable.[36] This model tests the association of sex and race to variation in the follow-up MRI that is unexplained (residuals) by baseline MRI, i.e. the variability due to change. Model 1 included sex and race, adjusting for age, center and education (years). To explore whether race and sex differences were explained by CVH-LS7 factors, we additionally entered into Model 2, each LS7 metrics individually and then separately as a composite score where the presence of a healthy metric is given 1 point and summed up, so higher scores mean better CV health. We tested for sex- race interactions by entering into the models the race*sex term.

In secondary analyses we included in Model 2 the individual metrics that are continuous. Since estimates were similar we present the public-health relevant CVH-LS7 metrics. In Model 3 we included the presence or absence of the APOE*4 allele as a covariate to explore whether this marker of genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease explains sex and race differences.

To explore whether changes in volumes and CBF were related to cognitive function at follow-up we used the DSST, RAVLT and Stroop interference scores as the outcomes. These were exploratory analyses in our entire sample with n=478 participants, as a larger sample size would be needed for reliable detection by each race and sex subgroup separately. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (Build 1.0.0.1298, 64-bit edition) and a p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3. Results

The longitudinal sample (n=478) included 48.1% male and 38.3 % Black participants (Table 1). Mean age (SD) was 50.4 years (3.5) [range 43–56] at baseline and 55.4 (3.5) at follow-up [range 47–61]. Compared to the other race and sex groups, Black men least often had ideal CVH-LS7 levels for BMI, blood pressure and smoking; White men least often had ideal glucose levels. Black women were least likely to have ideal CVH-LS7 levels for physical activity and diet. Black men and women had proportionately more one or two copies of the APOE*4 allele. Baseline values for TBV, GMV and CBF were higher in women compared to men, with Black women having the highest values for all three measures (Table 2).

3.1 Midlife 5-year changes in brain tissue volumes and GM-CBF

Over the 5-year period between baseline and follow-up, there was a significant adjusted mean (95% CI) decline in TBV, GMV and GM-CBF; and marginal changes in WMV and WMH (Table 2). The crude annualized changes are: −0.12 (SD 0.19) % ICV/year for TBV; −0.13 (0.17) %ICV/year for GMV; and −0.57 (1.69) ml/100g/min/year for GM-CBF.

3.2 CVH-LS-7 and brain health

Accounting for baseline MRI and other Model 1 variables, the total score of LS7 was not associated with any MRI feature (Table e-4). However, specific components were associated with specific MRI measures. Compared to current smoking, never or former smoking was associated with larger TBV, GMV and WMV. Ideal levels for glucose was related to lower WMH volume.

3.3 Race and sex differences in midlife 5-year changes in brain volume and CBF

Overall, all race-sex groups had some decline in TBV, GMV, and GM-CBF, except for GM-CBF in Black women and White men (Column A, Table 3). There were significant race-sex interactions for GMV (P=0.004) and GM-CBF (P=0.01) (Column B Table 3). Overall compared to men, women had significantly less decline in TBV (column C, Table 3). Black compared to White participants had a significantly higher increase in WMH (P=0.002) (Column D, Table 3). Where there were significant sex-race interactions, we found Black women in particular had significantly less decline in GMV (mean difference, 95% CI −0.36 [−0.57, −0.16] compared to the other race-sex groups. Black men, in particular, had significantly more decline in GM-CBF than White and Black women (Column E, Table 3). Adjusting for the total CVR-LS7 score (Table e-5), or specifically for smoking, BP and glucose as metrics and as continuous variables(Table e-6),, or for the presence or absence of an ApoE*4 allele (Table e-7) marginally attenuated the race-sex differences. A larger increase in WMH was related to a lower DSST score (lower psychomotor speed) and a higher Stroop interference score (worse executive function). More decline in TBV and gray matter volume was related to a higher Stroop interference score (Table e-8).

4. Discussion

In this community based bi-racial middle age (mean 50 y at baseline) cohort, there were race and sex differences in brain health at baseline. After 5 years, there were significant differences by race and sex in the amount of adverse change in MRI features. Specifically, overall, there was a significant decline in TBV, GMV and GM-CBF as well as a marginal increase in WMH. Compared to women, men had a greater decline in TBV and GMV. Sex differences in GMV and GM-CBF were most pronounced in Blacks. Although there were race-sex differences in CVH-LS7 and in the frequency of the APOE*4 allele, entering these characteristics into our base model did not change results.

There are few longitudinal studies of brain MRI changes in middle age bi-racial community-based cohorts. However, cross-sectional data over the life course suggest brain volumes begin an accelerated decline in the 6th decade, suggesting we are capturing change at a critical point when subsequent brain pathology develops.[37] Cross-sectional studies also suggest GMV tends to atrophy sooner than WM,[38] consistent with the small but significant decline in GMV in our cohort. There was a small but positive increase in WMV, which may be due to minor measurement errors in the automatic segmentation of white matter.

The changes in this middle-age cohort are relatively modest compared to those with cardiovascular disease or cognitive impairment. For example, in this cohort (mean age 50 yrs. at baseline) TBV declined by 0.118%ICV which over a 20-year period would be 2.36%ICV loss of TBV, assuming a linear decline and relatively good health. However, for instance, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is expected to double in the next decades, disproportionately in race-sex groups (https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/resources-publications/index.htm). In the ACCORD MIND trial of persons with long-standing T2DM (mean age 62), [36] participants had a 4cm3/year decline in TBV. Further, cognitive trajectories to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia are non-linear and can increase exponentially increase by age, affecting more than 30% of people 75 years and older.[39] In the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, they found 0.8% decline per year in those who converted to MCI or dementia, which reflects underlying brain atrophy, vascular damage and hypoperfusion.[1, 2, 40] By establishing a baseline in middle age, with prospective follow-up we will be able to better identify persons at future risk for dementia. Specifically, our study design mitigates the bias in age of clinical onset and trajectory shape that can be caused by not including into the cohort people who have already started to decline, or including people who have already started to decline [left censoring or truncation].[41]

Studies of similarly designed cohorts of older persons have found some race or sex differences in brain MRI measures. For example, the CHS study (over 65 yrs. old at baseline) showed men compared to women, had significantly more decline in total brain volume; race differences were not tested.[42] The ARIC MRI-subsample (baseline age 62 yrs.) showed after 10 years, Blacks had a higher WML load, with no sex differences. Neither study examined differences by sex-race groups.[43] A large cross-sectional pCASL study in midlife (age range: 30–55 years) showed that men compared to women had significantly lower CBF but did not find race differences.[13]

In addition to when and which sub-groups are at risk, the other important question for prevention is whether adverse changes and disparities in these changes can be prevented. To address this question, we explored the effects on the models of adding American Heart Association ideal CVH-LS factors. In our subsample, Black compared to White participants were least likely to have some CVS-LS7 ideal levels, consistent with other studies.[15] Previous cross-sectional analyses of the CARDIA MRI sub-sample showed a higher CHV-LS7 score was significantly associated with higher TBV.[26] In this longitudinal analysis, the total CVH-LS7 score was not associated with the amount of change in the MRI measures and only partially attenuated race-sex differences. However specific metrics were associated with indicators of brain health including no current smoking (higher TBV, GMV and WMV) and ideal levels of glucose (smaller increase in WMH). Smoking and diabetes are robustly found to increase the risk for early brain aging[21] and dementia. We did see an inverse association between an ideal level for physical activity and larger decline in CBF that may reflect a race-sex imbalance. Even though we statistically controlled for sex, there may be residual effects that reflects unmeasured exposures captured by these two variables.

Although there is robust evidence that cardio-vascular risk factors have a negative impact on the brain, our study suggests CVH-LS7 metrics as proposed do not, in the age of this cohort and the small amount of change, substantially explain early sub-group differences in decline of brain health metrics. Sex and race are concepts that include interactions among many emerging bio-behavioral factors that translate to health differences and that have not yet been systematically studied. This includes influencers such as the socio-economic environment, mental health, access to health and social services, geo-spatial neighborhood environments, and institutional racism, all of which have recently been encapsulated into the meta-concept of the ‘exposome’.[44, 45] Additionally, the observed sex differences in brain health may be due to sex -specific differences that affect gene expression patterns, hormonal balance,[46] vascular health,[47] the gut microbiome,[48] or mechanisms related to accelerated aging.[49]

This study contributes to gaps in our knowledge about who and when to target prevention interventions to prevent dementia. The strengths of this study include the prospective design, the inclusion of people in the age range that brain health begins to decline, the inclusion of two race/ethnicities living in different regions in the US, and standardized acquisition of MRI and risk factors.

However, in this context, there are limitations of our study. Although this study is based on a relatively large longitudinal MRI sample, it is limited to those who participated in the CARDIA study 25- and 30-year follow-ups and in both MRI exams. We showed that participants who did not return for follow-up MRI had less favorable CVH LS-7 scores. The reduced sample size affects statistical power and can reflect bias if the associations of the variables of interest differ between those who did and did not participate in the follow-up. When interpreting these data, it is also important to consider our approach to risk factor definition. We used one time point measured at the baseline MRI exam, and we expressed the risk factors in a clinically positive way as a total score of CVH metrics shown maintain cardio-vascular health. Based on this study of people in their 50s, a focus on a single health metric targeted to the individual needs may be more effective than using composite scores to guide effective reduction of future risk.[26] Finally, this study is based on 2 MRI time points and we studied macroscopic changes in the brain. In order to prospectively establish divergent trajectories of brain health, robust markers of developing brain pathology are needed to be measured early in the life course, and more frequently to achieve the goal of identifying effective early prevention approach to reduce the risk of devastating late-life dementias.

MRI acquisition

CARDIA MRI protocol consists of: i) Sagittal T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) data acquired with TR/TE/TI=1900/2.9/900 ms, flip angle=90, bandwidth=170 Hz/pixel, voxel size=1×1×1 mm, matrix=256×256, slices=176. ii) Sagittal T2 weighted MRI was obtained with TR/TE= 3200/409ms, bandwidth=750Hz/pixel, voxel size=1×1×1 mm, matrix=258×256, slices=176. iii) Sagittal Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI acquired with TR/TE/TI=6000/160/2200 ms, bandwidth=930 Hz/px, voxel size=1×1×1 mm, matrix=258×221, slices=160. iv) Non-background suppressed 2D pseudocontinuous ASL (pCASL) data acquired with gradient-echo echoplanar imaging (EPI) with TR/TE=4000/11 ms, voxel size=3.4×3.4×5 mm3, matrix=64×64, flip angle=90 degree, FOV=220×220 mm2, bandwidth=3004 Hz/pixel, echo spacing=0.44 ms and EPI factor=64. 20 slices with a distance factor of 20% were acquired from inferior to superior in a sequential order. The labeling was performed with a labeling duration of 1.48 s, post labeling delay (PLD)=1.5 s at 9cm below the center of the imaging volume. 40 label/control pairs were acquired for signal averaging.

MRI post-processing

MRI data was transferred to a central archive and processed at the CARDIA MRI Reading Center at the University of Pennsylvania using an automated pipeline. Images with incidental findings, motion artifacts, or poor image quality affecting image processing were excluded from analyses.

Structural MR images were processed using a previously described automated multispectral computer algorithm. After correction of intensity inhomogeneities[1] a multi-atlas skull stripping algorithm was applied to remove extra-cranial tissues.[2] Each T1-weighted scan was automatically segmented into a set of anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) using a multi-atlas label fusion method, MUSE.[3] WMH were segmented from FLAIR images using an automated Deep Learning method that was trained and validated on 3T scans. Volumes of normal and abnormal brain tissues were calculated within specific anatomic regions of interest of the cerebrum. Regions of interest for this paper were volumes of total gray matter (GM), normal white matter (WM), abnormal white matter (WM hyperintensities; WMH), total brain (TBV; the sum of GM, WM and WMH) and Intracranial volume (ICV), a measure of head size, was estimated as the sum of GM, WM, WMH and cerebral spinal fluid, based on T2 images, which have high contrast between the high signal in CSF and low signal in the skull. pCASL processing followed the recommendation by Alsop et al[4] and is previously described by Dolui.[5] Processing included motion correction, CBF quantification and subsequent denoising based on a structural correlation with Robust Bayesian criteria.[6] We report CBF in GM as pCASL is known to have a lower accuracy in white matter.[4]

Ideal levels of the American Heart Association (AHA) Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) cardiovascular health metrics were defined as: never smoking or quit &gt;12 months; BMI &lt;25.0 kg/m2; physical activity at goal levels of ≥300 exercise units (representing 30 min of moderate physical activity 5 times/week);untreated total cholesterol &lt;200 mg/dL; untreated systolic/diastolic blood pressure &lt;120/&lt;80 mm Hg; untreated fasting blood glucose &lt;100 mg/dL; and diet consistent with current guideline recommendations. Ideal diet was defined as having at least 4 of the following 5 components: fruits and vegetables: ≥ 4.5 servings/d; sodium: &lt;1,500 mg/day; fish: ≥7 oz/week; whole grains: ≥ 3 servings/day; and sugar-sweetened beverages: &lt; 32 oz/week. Values for participants with an extreme energy intake (defined as &lt;800 or &gt;8,000 kcal/day for men and &lt;600 or &gt;6,000 kcal/day for women) were set to missing. The total score ranges from 0 (no metric at ideal level) to 7 (all metrics at ideal levels).

ICV=intra-cranial volume, CBF=cerebral blood flow, WMH=white matter hyperintensities. # WMH were transformed with inverse hyperbolic sine transformation f(x)=log(x+( x2+1)0.5). P-values for interaction and for comparisons amongst groups (amongst sex, race or race-sex groups) are adjusted for age, center, education, and baseline value of MRI feature (Model 1). Sample size for volumes: n=478, for cerebral perfusion n=235

Research in context

1. Systematic review:

The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (PubMed) sources. While there have been publications on race and sex differences in adverse brain changes that precede dementia, i.e. cerebral atrophy, white matter disease, and lower cerebral blood flow (CBF), early midlife data is scarce.

2. Interpretation:

Our findings demonstrate that men showed more decline than women in gray matter volume and CBF, and this was most evident in Blacks. Blacks compared to Whites had a significantly greater increase in white matter hyperintensities. All sex-race differences in change were marginally attenuated by cardiovascular health (CVH) and APOEε4.

3. Future directions:

To further understand the race and sex differences in mid-life brain health new environmental factors beyond CVH need to be identified. To establish divergent trajectories of mid-life brain health decline by race and sex can identify high risk groups to target for early preventative strategies to reduce dementia risk.
