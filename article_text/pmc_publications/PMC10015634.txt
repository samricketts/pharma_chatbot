Background:

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive decline. A particular haplogroup of mtDNA, haplogroup J, has been observed more commonly in patients with AD than in cognitively normal controls.

Objective:

We used two mtDNA haplogroups, H and J, to predict change in cognitive performance over five years. We hypothesized that haplogroup J carriers would show less cognitive resilience.

Methods:

We analyzed data from 140 cognitively normal older adults who participated in the University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center clinical cohort between 2011 and 2020. We used factor analysis to create three composite scores (verbal memory, attention, and executive function) from 11 individual cognitive tests. We performed latent growth curve modeling to describe trajectories of cognitive performance and change adjusting for age, sex, years of education, and APOE ε4 allele carrier status. We compared haplogroup H, the most common group, to haplogroup J, the potential risk group.

Results:

Haplogroup J carriers had significantly lower baseline performance and slower rates of improvement on tests of verbal memory compared to haplogroup H carriers. We did not observe differences in executive function or attention.

Conclusion:

Our results reinforce the role of mtDNA in changes to cognitive function in a domain associated with risk for dementia, verbal memory, but not with other cognitive domains. Future research should investigate the distinct mechanisms by which mtDNA might affect performance on verbal memory as compared to other cognitive domains across haplogroups.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has a complex pathogenesis influenced by numerous genetic and environmental risk factors. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late onset AD, and genome-wide association and whole exome sequencing studies have identified several additional genomic contributions to AD risk [1–3]. Some of these additional contributors implicate nuclear genes that encode mitochondrial proteins or proteins that affect mitochondrial function [4–6]. Mitochondrial dysfunction is observed in AD and may contribute to disease pathogenesis.

Mitochondria contain their own DNA, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). As is the case with nuclear DNA, mtDNA sequences can manifest continent-specific patterns with defined polymorphism combinations. Like nuclear DNA, when a series of mtDNA variants link to each other and exhibit co-inheritance, they are said to define a haplotype. MtDNA haplotypes continuously evolve as new mutations arise upon and become fixed within the context of an existing set of linked mutations. More recent mutations typically demonstrate, at least early on, greater geographic specificity and mtDNA haplotypes can help catalog migration patterns [7].

At a population level, haplotype evolution raises lumping versus splitting considerations. With mtDNA, the current default is to organize groups of haplotypes with an arbitrarily defined critical pattern of common variants into “haplogroups.” It is possible to define more specific haplotypes within a particular haplogroup, just as it is possible to combine the most closely related haplogroups to define “super haplogroups.”

MtDNA experiences negligible recombination [8]. Partly because of this, despite current robust levels of human mobility and migration, haplogroups continue to some extent to inform geographic ancestry and through this, race and ethnicity. When considering human phenotypes, it is reasonable to consider whether a haplogroup’s defining variants, singly or in combination, are biologically consequential. In this respect, association studies that explore whether defined phenotypes correlate with specific mtDNA haplogroups can prove informative [9].

Several studies report that particular mtDNA polymorphisms and haplogroups are more frequently observed in patients with AD than in similarly aged adults without AD [10–15], although several other studies failed to confirm these findings [16–23]. A systematic review suggests numerous potential explanations for failure to replicate these findings including limited sample sizes, inappropriate models, and technical difficulties [24]. Liu et al. [15] have demonstrated that one of these mtDNA haplogroups, haplogroup J, influences the rate of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Tranah et al. [25] reported that participants free of dementia at baseline with haplogroup J had a statistically significant 8-year decline on a dementia screening tool compared with the most common European-originated haplogroup, haplogroup H.

What is less well known is whether the effects of mtDNA haplogroups can be detected in changes in cognitive function at higher levels of performance (i.e., using assessments more challenging than dementia screening tools), among older adults who do not have cognitive impairment or dementia. Some research emphasizes the notion that individuals with greater cognitive resilience may present continued high cognitive function despite accumulation of pathology [26]. Such resilience may obscure deficits that may be detectable using more demanding cognitive assessments. One skill that is impaired in early stages of the AD dementia syndrome is learning and formation of new memories. We investigated whether this haplogroup confers its effects on cognitive function in a way that might hint at a future dementing illness. Thus, we compared the role of haplogroup J in participants who were cognitively normal to the role of haplogroup H. We used mtDNA haplogroups to predict change in cognitive performance over a five-year follow up period, hypothesizing that haplogroup J would predict poorer cognitive function over time.

Materials and Methods

Study Design

The University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (KU ADRC) collects longitudinal data on a clinical cohort that includes participants with cognitive impairment and with normal cognition. Our battery includes the uniform data set (UDS). Cognitively normal individuals are included at age 60 and older. The present study is a five-year longitudinal analysis of a subset of data collected from this clinical cohort (N = 140 at baseline). The first time point represents baseline and subsequent time points represent follow up visits at approximately one-year intervals.

Consent

Entry into the cohort requires written consent from each participant, as well as written consent from a study partner. The consent forms and processes were approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center’s institutional review board and research activities were conducted in accord with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. The consent form and protocols specify that cognitive and genetic data obtained from each participant will be included in studies pertinent to AD and brain aging.

Participants and Participant Selection

Participants undergo a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) interview. The participants complete the UDS evaluation defined by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) ADRC network, as well as additional cognitive tests that include letter number sequencing, the free and cued selective reminding test, and Stroop test. At the time of cohort entry, we determine APOE genotypes and mtDNA haplogroups. The KU ADRC reviews initial and subsequent annual CDR and neuropsychological test scores at weekly consensus diagnostic conferences that includes clinicians, a neuropsychologist, psychometricians, and other staff who participate in the evaluation process. Participants included in the present study had a CDR score of 0 and no demonstrable cognitive deficits and were classified as cognitively normal. Although our larger clinical cohort of participants ranges in racial and ethnic makeup (11% African American, 1% Asian, 2% Hispanic/Latino), after excluding participants based on haplogroup and cognitive status, the remaining sample was 100% Caucasian. The proportion of the clinical cohort with haplogroups H and J (86% and 14% respectively) is in general agreement with the proportion of haplogroup J in other North American cohorts [27].

Genotyping Procedures

Detailed descriptions of the haplogroup determination procedures have been published elsewhere [27]. In brief, total cellular DNA was extracted either by the KU ADRC or by the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease (NCRAD) from blood samples drawn from participants at the time of enrollment. The mtDNA was selectively amplified with primers employed in previous studies [28,29] and the amplicons used to construct sequencing libraries. The libraries were sequenced using either an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq v3 instrument. After completing a sequencing quality examination using FastQC [30], the reads were then aligned to the human mitochondrial genome reference sequence (NCBI accession number NC_012920). The reads for each subject were used to generate variant call files (VCF) employing the GATK package. The mitochondrial genome sequence generated by GATK was then used to assign each subject’s haplogroup employing the Phy-Mer mitochondrial haplogroup classifier [31].

APOE genotypes have been shown to interact with mtDNA haplogroups [32]. Thus, we included APOE genotype as a covariate of interest. APOE genotyping was performed by NCRAD, with independent verification of selected samples by the KU ADRC Mitochondrial Genomics and Metabolism Core using a previously described allelic discrimination assay [33].

Cognitive Tests

A standardized cognitive test battery was administered by a trained psychometrician, and included tests of immediate and delayed verbal memory [Wechsler WMS], the selective reminding test [34], Numerical span [Wechsler WAISIII], letter number sequencing [35], the Trail Making Test [36], Category Fluency [37], the Digit Symbol Substitution Test [35], and the Stroop Test, Interference Condition [38]. For tests that changed from the UDS version 2.0 to the UDS version 3.0, we used the previously published “cross walk” scores that estimate the equivalent scores across the two versions of the test (i.e., Craft Immediate and Delayed Recall replaced Logical Memory IA and IIA, and number span forward and backward replaced digit span forward and backward [39]).

Covariates and Statistical Analysis

We treated age, sex, years of education, and APOE ε4 allele carrier status (coded as 0, 1, or 2 copies of ε4) as covariates as they are each strongly associated with cognitive performance. All cognitive tests were standardized as Z-scores relative to the mean at baseline. Thus, scores at each subsequent follow up are calculated relative to baseline mean scores and can be interpreted as a change from baseline. We report findings from six waves of assessment, each approximately one year apart, baseline through 5 years of follow up.

We combined cognitive test scores into domain specific factor scores using Confirmatory Factor Analysis in Mplus version 7. We organized specific tests by whether they primarily address attention, verbal memory, or executive function. Tests of attention included numerical span forward and backward, letter-number sequencing, and Trailmaking Test A. Tests of verbal memory included immediate and delayed verbal memory, as well as the sum of three selective reminding test free recall trials. Tests of executive function assessed set maintenance and shifting and included category fluency (sum of animal and vegetable categories), Stroop color word interference, Trailmaking Test B, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. We used the extracted factor scores from the cognitive tests as outcomes in subsequent models. Details about the cognitive factor score models can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

We estimated latent growth curve models to examine the longitudinal trend of neuropsychological test scores in these three cognitive domains over six waves of data collection, baseline through five years of follow up (Figure 1). We estimated linear and quadratic models and compared the model fits to determine which model better fit the longitudinal data. Latent growth curve models are advantageous because they include measurement error in the model for accurate estimation of true cognitive scores (factor scores). They also allow the correlation of cognitive tests scores in different waves. The full model estimated the association of haplogroup with the intercept (initial status) and slope (rate of change) of cognitive scores adjusting for covariates (age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 alleles).

Missing data were accounted for using a full information maximum likelihood algorithm. To evaluate model fit we used Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), a measure of the discrepancy between fitted and perfect models. Values closer to 0 indicate better fit (preferred values are &lt;0.05). We report a comparative fit index (CFI) that estimates the relative fit of a model compared to an alternative model, in which a CFI &gt;0.90 indicates good fit. Typically, these multiple fit indices are considered together, as opposed to relying on any one indicator by itself. Latent growth curve modeling is a form of structural equation modeling and includes all hypothesized pathways simultaneously in the model, which allowed us to avoid multiple testing-induced inflation of type 1 error.

Results

We analyzed data from 140 KU-ADRC clinical cohort participants who belonged to either haplogroup H, the most commonly occurring type (n = 120), or haplogroup J (n=20), whose frequency was increased among the AD members of a combined longitudinal cohort containing both AD and cognitively normal participants [27]. We present participant demographics and frequencies for each haplogroup in Table 1. Among those in haplogroup J, 16 were J1 and four were J2. Among those in haplogroup H, 48% were H1. See Supplemental Figure 1 for comparisons of the unadjusted cognitive scores for the J1 and J2 carriers.

Due to attrition, sample sizes were smaller at each subsequent wave of follow up (Wave 2 = 125, Wave 3 = 118, Wave 4 = 102, Wave 5 = 94, Wave 6 = 84). Because our study enrolled participants on a rolling basis, for many participants missing data at later waves indicates they started the study later and had not been participants long enough to have reached the 4, 5, or 6-year follow up time points. Other reasons for missing data include 6 deaths, 9 withdrawals, and 1 permanent move to a nursing home.

In studies of cognitive change, loss to follow up can indicate a change in cognitive status. We took steps to prevent this in our analysis by excluding individuals who were ultimately characterized as not cognitively normal based on multiple assessments. Most participants were rated as cognitively normal at all time-points (84%). In longitudinal studies that serially assess cognitive status, though, it is not unusual for participants designated as cognitively normal to transition out of the cognitively normal group (to MCI, or to impaired-not MCI) before subsequently transitioning back to cognitive normal status. In our study, a small percentage of participants demonstrated such a pattern; these participants were present in both the H and J groups. To minimize the effect of cognitive transitions on our study, we only included in our analysis participants who were categorized as cognitively normal at the conclusion of the study.

We used the full information likelihood estimation to account for missing data in the model. Supplemental Table 1 shows the loadings (regression coefficients) of each cognitive test onto the composite factor scores at wave 1.

We estimated the associations of predictors and covariates with baseline cognitive performance (intercept) and change over time (slope) using latent growth curve modeling. Comparison of linear and quadratic models demonstrated that the more complex models did not provide better fit, thus we did not pursue quadratic models further. Table 2 shows the results of these models adjusted for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 alleles.

For verbal memory scores, haplogroup J predicted a lower baseline score (intercept, M = 1.976 (Group H) vs. M = 1.784 (Group J); β (SE) = −.192 (.089), p = .031), and a slower rate of improvement over time (slope, M = 0.865 (Group H) vs. M = .439 (Group J); β (SE) = .426 (.144), p = .003). For attention and executive function scores, haplogroup was not associated with intercept or slope of scores. The pattern of performance is represented in Figure 2. The lines represent the mean performance across waves of follow up by haplogroup, adjusting for covariates in the model.

As a measure of effect size, we compared the change in R2 in models with and without haplogroup. The change in R2 for predicting the intercept for verbal memory was Δ.035 (95% CI: .297-.262). The change in R2 for predicting the slope for verbal memory was Δ.177 (95% CI: .244-.067). These changes indicate that including haplogroup in the latent growth curve model improves the variance accounted for in verbal memory at baseline by 3.5%, and improves the prediction of slope of change over time by 17.7%. Because the cognitive scores are standardized, we can see that the difference between haplogroup H and haplogroup J in verbal memory at year 5 is 1.45 standard deviations. Thus, those in haplogroup J performed worse by nearly one and a half standard deviations at the end of a five year follow up period.

Discussion

Among cognitively normal participants of the KU ADRC clinical cohort, mtDNA haplogroup H- and J-defined groups differed in verbal memory performance at baseline and these groups continued to diverge over time. We did not observe these differences in attention or executive function. Scores for both groups improved on average over the years, but haplogroup J started lower and saw a much shallower increase. Previous studies including the CERAD dementia prevention trial have demonstrated that moderately sized practice effects are common in longitudinal studies of cognitively normal older adults and are not explained by attrition [40]. Dodge et al. [41] concluded that lack of practice effects may, in fact, indicate change of trajectory in those who later exhibit MCI. Thus, we propose that individuals belonging to haplogroup J may not benefit equally from practice effects compared to those in haplogroup H.

Previous research supports an association between haplogroup J, faster conversion from MCI to dementia, and poorer scores on a cognitive screening tool [15,25]. By comparison to previous studies, participants in our study were classified as cognitively normal after extensive cognitive and clinical assessments, suggesting members of haplogroup J may be at risk for future development of cognitive impairment or dementia. It is possible that haplogroup J confers risk for declining verbal memory and learning function before any cognitive deficits are clinically detectable. This divergence between groups may also reflect what is sometimes called cognitive resilience, the continuance of cognitive function despite accumulating pathology [26].

Our results extend prior reports that found haplogroup J can impact the continuum of dementia progression, particularly in its earliest stages. Liu et al. [15] showed that haplogroup J affects conversion from MCI to AD. Tranah et al. [25] demonstrated haplogroup J influences longitudinal declines in performance of dementia free individuals on a dementia screening tool. While Tranah et al. emphasized data generated from the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS), which is useful for identifying those who may already have impairment, by contrast our study used assessments more challenging for cognitively normal participants. Our results demonstrated a flattening of improvement on cognitive tests that specifically interrogate verbal memory, which may reflect a state of change that precedes those that manifest as decline on a dementia screening tool. Further, at the stage in which we observed verbal memory differences, we were unable to identify limitations in other cognitive domains. Future research should expand this investigation to larger samples with extensive cognitive test batteries. In this study, we did not combine or compare our sample with other samples because the test batteries across the different samples do not fully overlap. This prevents us from extending our study’s specific factor analysis to other pertinent studies.

Changes in brain structures suspected to underlie cognitive changes that accompany typical brain aging include the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampal regions [42]. We did not see group differences in cognitive performance in areas most extensively supported by pre-frontal cortex (i.e., attention and executive function). Instead, we observed group differences in verbal memory, a domain that is impaired in the early stages of AD and distinguished by marked changes in hippocampal volume and morphology [43]. Further study is warranted to verify whether haplogroup J represents a risk factor for declines in verbal learning and memory that may be detectable prior to clinically observable impairments or a risk factor for accelerated brain aging.

Controversy remains about whether cognitive decline representing “normal aging” is distinct from pathological declines that ultimately manifest as dementing illnesses. Is cognitive decline part of a continuum of normal aging or is it a distinct pathological process [44–47]? Our results may have implications for that debate in that haplogroup J appears to affect verbal memory, but not other cognitive domains in participants verified to be cognitively normal. Next steps might consider whether haplogroups H and J represent different “cognitive aging phenotypes” with haplogroup J leading to deficits and declines specific to the process of verbal learning and memory. Some argue that cognitive decline with healthy aging has a distinct pattern of brain changes (i.e., dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex function) compared to pathological changes seen in people with amnestic symptoms (i.e., mesiotemporal and hippocampal changes).

It is important to acknowledge methodological distinctions between cross-sectional and longitudinal association and note that the length of longitudinal follow up and cognitive status at baseline may influence observed changes in cognitive performance. In our analysis, participants are not demonstrating declines in performance; rather we are likely observing lost advantages of practice effects. If we followed those with haplogroup J further into the aging process, we might expect them to eventually develop MCI or AD. Alternatively, it is possible another phenotype of amnestic-related cognitive aging exists that does not ultimately lead to AD pathology.

There are methodological limitations that may influence our results and interpretations. All longitudinal research must consider attrition over time, which is not missing at random. Those lost to follow up are likely to be among the poorest performers. Our analysis used statistical methods to impute missing data, to account for the loss of participants over time, and we cannot assume perfect estimation. Another statistical consideration is the difference in sample size between the groups, as a naturally occurring phenomenon, as opposed to sample error. The smaller group (haplogroup J) unsurprisingly had a slightly higher rate of attrition. Thus, it is likely to have more error and less precision in estimation.

Differences in cognitive performance between haplogroup H and J participants infer that an mtDNA polymorphism or polymorphisms, alone or in combination, influence mitochondrial biology and through this, cell biology. Pertinent to this point, cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) studies report that relative to cybrid lines that contain haplogroup H mtDNA, lines that contain haplogroup J have less ATP, less oxidative stress, less oxygen consumption, more lactate production, a lower mitochondrial membrane potential, more nuclear DNA methylation, less SIRT3, lower NAD+/NADH ratios, and increased inflammatory cytokine expression [48–52]. A single study, though, reported negative results for some of these parameters [53]. One cybrid study found that relative to cybrids with haplogroup H, haplogroup J cybrids had less mtDNA, mtDNA-derived transcripts, and mtDNA-encoded peptides [48], while another reported haplogroup J cybrids exhibited a profound (~2.5 fold increase) in mtDNA [54]. Some of the incongruence reported in the literature may reflect methodologic differences utilized by different investigative teams. Additional studies will ideally inform questions of haplogroup H versus J functional consequences.

Our results have theoretical and clinical implications. First, more focus is needed on bioenergetic processes that may prove to be a key biological feature of AD [1,55–58]. Currently, the focus of much research is on amyloid beta, which does not correlate well with cognitive symptoms. More attention to mitochondrial theories of brain aging and what role they may play in the process of developing AD is warranted. Regarding clinical practice, our findings imply a potential for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment based on identification of mtDNA haplogroup. Individuals with haplogroup J may benefit from the development of therapies that target impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism. This includes behavioral interventions that affect brain bioenergetics, including exercise &amp; diet. For example, research shows that a ketogenic diet can benefit mitochondrial function and perhaps cognitive performance in AD [59,60]. Future research is needed to investigate distinct mechanisms by which mtDNA may affect longitudinal changes in cognitive performance and inform individualized risk reduction strategies and therapeutic interventions.

Figure 1. The latent growth curve model, which assumes a linear change in cognitive performance between each year of follow up.

We used haplogroup status (H vs. J) to predict differences in the intercept (baseline score) and slope (change in scores over time) for cognitive performance in each of three domains (verbal memory, attention, and executive function). The numbers one through six aligned with the slope represent a linear change from year to year. The ones aligned with the intercept represent the stability of the intercept across years in the model (i.e., the intercept does not change, but the subsequent year’s scores change in a linear fashion).

The solid lines represent the performance and change of haplogroup H, and the dashed lines represent the performance and change of haplogroup J over 5 years of longitudinal follow up. The three graphs represent changes in verbal memory, attention, and executive function scores respectively.
