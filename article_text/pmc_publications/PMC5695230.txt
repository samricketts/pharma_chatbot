Importance

With advancing age, an increased visibility of perivascular spaces on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is hypothesized to represent impaired drainage of intersitital fluid from the brain and may reflect underlying cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). However, whether large MRI-visible perivascular spaces (&gt;3 mm in diameter; L-PVS) are associated with SVD and cognitive deterioration in older people are unknown.

Objective

To determine whether L-PVS, and more specifically their count and location, are associated with the progression of established MRI markers of SVD, cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The prospective population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility–Reykjavik Study, assessed L-PVS at baseline (September 1, 2002, through February 28, 2006) on MRI studies of the brain in 2612 participants aged 65–97 years (59.0% women). Participants returned for a second MRI scan from April 1, 2007, through September 30, 2011 and underwent neuropsychological testing at the two time points a mean (SD) of 5.2 (0.2) years apart.

Exposures

L-PVS presence, number and location.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident subcortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds and progression of white matter hyperintensities detected on MRIs; cognitive decline defined as composite score changes between baseline and follow-up in the domains of memory, information processing speed and executive function; adjudicated incident dementia cases diagnosed according to international guidelines.

Results

L-PVS prevalence was 16.2% (median number: 1 [range, 1–17]). After adjusting for age, sex and time interval between baseline and follow-up scanning, the presence of L-PVS was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident subcortical infarcts (adjusted risk ratio 2.54; 95% confidence interval 1.76–3.68) and microbleeds (1.43; 95%CI 1.18–1.72), and a greater 5-year progression of white matter hyperintensities volume. The presence of L-PVS was also associated with a steeper decline in information processing speed and more than quadrupled the risk of vascular dementia. All associations persisted when further adjusted for genetic and cerebrovascular risk factors. The associations with cognitive outcomes were independent of education, depression and other SVD MRI markers.

Conclusions and Relevance

L-PVS are an MRI marker of SVD and associated with the pathogenesis of vascular-related cognitive impairment in older people.


Introduction

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a major contributor to cognitive impairment in older people.1, 2 Apart from well-established neuroimaging hallmarks of SVD, including small subcortical infarcts, white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds, MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) are emerging as another potential SVD marker. The perivascular spaces are fluid-filled cavities surrounding small penetrating cerebral arterioles and venules, and commonly considered to play an important role in forming a network of drainage channels for the elimination of metabolic waste and fluid from the brain.3 When the caliber and the number of normally microscopic perivascular spaces increases with advancing age, PVS appear on T2-weighted MRI as round or tubular hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and white matter.4–6 Pathologically, the mechanisms underlying PVS may involve the two commonest sporadic forms of SVD including hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), plausibly leading to different anatomical PVS patterns.1, 7

There is increasing epidemiological evidence that PVS are associated with some MRI manifestations of SVD and cognitive impairment in patients with cerebrovascular disease8–10 or dementia,11, 12 and in neurologically healthy adults.7, 13, 14 As yet, longitudinal data are scarce15 and the clinical significance of PVS in the general population of older people remains uncertain. Looking prospectively at the relationship would help to disentangle the complex interplay betwee PVS and other SVD and better define the cognitive consequence of PVS.

Previous studies have focused on detecting smaller PVS lesions with a maximum diameter &lt;3 mm on MRI in an attempt to separate PVS from lacunes of presumed vascular origin, although pathological studies have not shown an absolute cutoff size to discriminate between the two lesions.16–18 Here, we examined large PVS (L-PVS) with diameters of &gt;3 mm, which are morphologically distinguished from lacunes on MRI. Indeed, L-PVS are frequently encountered in ostensibly healthy older people and their prevalence increases with higher numbers of smaller PVS.19 We thus investigated in a large well-characterized cohort of older people, the prospective associations between, on the one hand, prevalent L-PVS and, on the other, SVD progression, cognitive decline and risk of new-onset dementia.

Methods

Participants

This investigation was conducted as part of the prospective population-based AGES-Reykjavik Study, which originates from the Reykjavik Study, as described in detail previously.20 Briefly, from 2002 to 2006, 5764 surviving men and women of the Reykjavik Study cohort born 1907–1935 underwent extensive physical, cognitive and brain MRI examinations (AGES I). From 2007 to 2011, there was a follow-up examination of all surviving participants who agreed to participate (AGES II). Of the 3,316 participants who attended the follow-up examination, we excluded 654 participants if the baseline MRI scans were unavailable, incomplete or of inadequate quality. In total, 2612 participants without prevalent dementia were included in SVD progression analysis. Of these, 2592 participants were included in dementia analysis and 2551 participants were included in cognitive decline analysis (eMethods, eFigure 1 &amp; eTable 1). The study was approved by the Icelandic National Bioethics Committee (VSN 00-063), and by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written informed consent.

Brain MRI and L-PVS assessment

We acquired brain MRI scans on a study-dedicated 1.5-T scanner (Signa Twinspeed, General Electric Medical Systems, Waukesha, WI). The same MRI protocol, described elsewhere,21–23 was used at both baseline and follow-up and included the following pulse sequences21: three-dimensional T1-weighted spoiled-gradient echo sequence, proton density/T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) sequence, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence, and T2*-weighted gradient echo-type echo planar (GRE-EPI) (eMethods). White matter hyperintensity volume (WMH) was quantified automatically and expressed as the percentage of total intracranial volume.22 Microbleeds were defined as a focal area of signal void within the brain parenchyma that is visible on T2*-weighted GRE-EPI and smaller or invisible on T2 weighted FSE scans.21, 23, 24 Subcortical infarcts were defined as brain parenchymal defects with a minimum diameter of 4 mm, not extending into the cortex, with a signal intensity equal to cerebrospinal fluid on all pulse sequences and surrounded by an area of high signal intensity on FLAIR images.25

To distinguish PVS from subcortical infarcts, L-PVS were evaluated separately and defined as round or tubular defects with a short axis larger than 3 mm in the subcortical area and without a rim or area of high signal intensity on the axial FLAIR (characteristics for infarcts), and without evidence of hemosiderin in its wall on the axial T2*-weighted GRE-EPI (characteristics for resorbed hemorrhagic lesions) (Fig. 1). The total L-PVS count was based on their presence in the basal ganglia complex (caudate nucleus, internal capsule, external capsule, thalamus, and lentiform nucleus [putamen and globus pallidus]) along the paths of the perforating lenticulostriate arteries (arising from the middle cerebral artery), and in white matter along the paths of the perforating medullary arteries. Intra-rater reliability (kappa) for L-PVS based on two ratings within a 6-month interval was 0.88 and 0.93 respectively, and the statistics of inter-rater agreement was 0.66, indicating good reliability. Our scan protocol could not be designed to capture smaller PVS (i.e. ≤3 mm in diameter) given that the slice thickness of the 2D FLAIR, proton density and T2 scans was 3 mm and the nature of smaller lesions was more difficult to assess reliably.

The presence of L-PVS, microbleeds and subcortical infarcts on both the baseline and follow-up scans was assessed by two trained radiographers. They were initially blinded to the baseline MRI scan and identified new lesions on the follow-up scan. If a lesion was detected on the follow-up scan, the baseline MRI scan was examined to determine whether the lesion was present in the same slice location. If so, the follow-up lesion was labeled ‘prevalent’; if not, the lesion was labeled ‘incident’.

Assessment of cognitive function

Participants underwent a neuropsychological test battery assessing three cognitive domains25 including verbal memory, processing speed and executive function (eMethods). The composite score for each cognitive domain was calculated by converting raw scores to standardized Z scores and averaging them across all tests for the domain.25 For each participant, we computed Z scores for both baseline and follow-up using the mean and SD of the baseline test scores. Cognitive decline was calculated by subtracting the baseline domain-specific Z scores from the follow-up Z scores.

Dementia diagnosis

Incident dementia cases were identified at follow-up examination based on a 3-step procedure (eMethods).25 The diagnosis of dementia and subtypes was made in accordance with international criteria (eMethods) and assigned at a consensus conference by a panel of a geriatrician, neurologist, neuropsychologist, and neuroradiologist.25

Statistical analysis

L-PVS were further categorized into a trichotomous variable (none, 1 single and multiple [≥ 2]). Because the anatomical distribution of L-PVS may reflect different SVD pathologies, we also examined L-PVS by location: a white matter distribution exclusively and those in the basal ganglia with and without concomitant white matter L-PVS.

We constructed multiple logistic regression models and performed the post-estimations (Stata ‘adjrr’ command) to calculate the adjusted risk ratios (i.e. the ratio of the mean predicted probabilities between those with and without the L-PVS) and 95% CIs for the associations between L-PVS presence and incident subcortical infarcts, microbleeds and dementia. We estimated the association between L-PVS presence and subsequent WMH progression and cognitive decline by multiple linear regression analyses. The change scores for WMH volume and processing speed were logarithmically transformed to normalize their skewed distributions. All analyses were initially adjusted for age, sex and time interval between the baseline and follow-up MRIs (model 1), followed by additional adjustment for head coil, body mass index, current smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol, prevalent symptomatic stroke and APOE4 genotype (model 2). With respect to the association with cognitive outcomes, we further adjusted for education, depression, baseline cerebral infarcts, microbleeds and WMH in addition to the above-mentioned variables (except for stroke) in model 2. Interactions between L-PVS and other covariates with respect to effects on SVD and cognitive outcomes were assessed in the fully-adjusted models by including cross-product terms of each covariate with L-PVS. All analyses were repeated for the number and location of L-PVS, and the association with L-PVS location was examined while controlling for L-PVS at other locations. Given the occurrence of dementia events was relatively lower (n&lt;5) within L-PVS number or location categories, we applied Fisher’s exact test to examine the crude associations with dementia. To test the robustness of the results, we did several sensitivity analyses (eMethods).

Results

The mean age of the study population at baseline was 74.6 years (SD 4.8), and 59.0% were women (Table 1). The prevalence of L-PVS was 16.2% (n=424) (median number of L-PVS, 1 [range, 1–17]), of a single L-PVS was 12.1% (n=315), and of ≥ 2 L-PVS was 4.2% (n=109). Among participants with L-PVS, 17.7% (n=75) had white matter L-PVS exclusively and 82.3% (n=349) had basal ganglia L-PVS with and without concomitant white matter L-PVS (includes those with mixed L-PVS in both locations, n=42). Over a mean follow-up of 5.2 years (SD 0.2), the cumulative incidence of SVD and dementia was described in eResults.

L-PVS and incident SVD

After adjusting for age, sex and brain MRI scan interval (model 1), the presence of L-PVS at baseline was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident subcortical infarcts and microbleeds, and a greater WMH progression (Table 2). Within each SVD marker, a significant trend was observed with increasing number of L-PVS: both a single and ≥ 2 L-PVS significantly increased the risk of incident subcortical infarcts and microbleeds and promoted a greater WMH progression, with the associations being strongest for ≥ 2 L-PVS. When stratifized acording to L-PVS location, the associations with subcortical infarcts and WMH were significant for basal ganglial L-PVS, whereas the association with incident microbleeds was significant for both white matter and basal ganglia L-PVS. When further adjusted for major cardiovascular risk factors, stroke and APOE4 genotype (model 2), all associations persisted except for the association between a single L-PVS and WMH progression, which became non-significant. There were no significant interactions of L-PVS with any of the covariates.

L-PVS, cognitive decline and dementia

The presence of L-PVS was associated with a steeper decline in information processing speed (Table 3, model 1). A significant trend was observed with increasing number of L-PVS: participants with ≥2 L-PVS had the greatest decline in processing speed compared to those with no L-PVS, with an “intermediate” decline for participants with a single L-PVS. Further, the association with processing speed was significant for basal ganglia L-PVS. In the fully-adjusted models, these estimates were attenuated, but remained significant for the presence or trend of increasing L-PVS number. No association of L-PVS was found for memory or executive function.

In the fully-adjusted model, the presence of L-PVS was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing vascular dementia (VaD) but not with all-cause dementia or Alzheimer’s disease (Table 4). The presence of a single L-PVS or basal ganglia L-PVS was associated with a higher incidence of VaD(eFigures 2&amp;3).

Discussion

In the general population of older people free of prevalent dementia at baseline, we found that the presence of L-PVS predicted new subcortical infarcts and microbleeds, and WMH progression over a 5-year period. Further, compared to people with no L-PVS, those with baseline L-PVS had a greater decline in processing speed and an increased likelihood of developing VaD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal demonstration to date that L-PVS are a risk factor for SVD progression and VaD.

Previous studies, mostly of cross-sectional design, found an association between, on the one hand, smaller PVS and, on the other hand, MRI markers of SVD,7–10 worse cognitive performance13, 26 and dementia.15 Although a diameter of 3 mm was generally used as a cutoff to differentiate smaller PVS from lacunes, the size criteria to discriminate both lesions on MRI has been the subject of much debate and is not confirmed pathologically.16, 17 Recent empirical evidence from a large population-based MRI study shows that while smaller PVS are always detected in basal ganglia or white matter in elderly people, L-PVS are also prevalent.19 Importantly, their prevalence significantly increases with the severity of smaller PVS.19 Our results demonstrate the associations with those large lesions and add new insights into the potential clinical significance of L-PVS in a community-based cohort of older adults. Our results thus lend strong support to the hypothesis that L-PVS, likely representing a more severe form of the lesion spectrum, serve as another key MRI manifestation of SVD and may reflect processes related to the pathogenesis of VaD.

PVS follow the course of the penetrating arterioles and are important drainage conduits for cerebral interstitial fluid, solutes and metabolic waste into the ventricles and for inflammatory and immunological processes.27 Some studies suggest that PVS may not only be an epiphenomenon, but also be a precursor of SVD.28, 29 For example, WMH tend to form around PVS and PVS has then been speculated to be an imaging biomarker for early alteration of arteriolar wall and blood-brain barrier function, which may eventually lead to hemosiderin leakage and lesions in the perivascular parenchyma.27 While the association between L-PVS and SVD progression provide support for such notion, we also found the presence of SVD markers at baseline was each significantly associated with incident L-PVS, suggesting the challenges in determining temporality amongst these lesions. This observed bi-directional association in our study implies the complex interplay between L-PVS and SVD markers and further strengthen the notion that shared microvascular pathways are involved to mediate the interplay. One potential mechanism is that the structural changes within the microvascular wall could gradually impair the external drainage of the interstitial fluid and solutes along the basement membranes, causing retrograde dilation of PVS either by diminishing the pulsatility of small vessels due to smooth muscle cell loss, or by blocking bulk flow.28, 30, 31 Impaired perivascular drainage could then further exacerbate solutes deposition including damaged peptides (e.g. leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vascular amyloid-β), creating a “feed-forward” loop.32, 33

We found that SVD associations with L-PVS may differ by their distribution, possibly suggesting different pathophysiological mechanisms relevant to the presumed underlying arteriopathy. The association with incident subcortical infarcts and WMH progression is significant for basal ganglia L-PVS, which are mainly driven by hypertensive arteriopathy affecting deep perforators.7–10 The association with incident microbleeds remains significant for L-PVS in both locations. The spatial distribution of microbleeds reflects specific microvascular pathologies (i.e. hypertensive arteriopathy and CAA) and the presence of cortical microbleeds or multiple strictly lobar micorobleeds is a putative neuroimaging marker of CAA.34 It is possible that CAA affecting the parent leptomeningeal or cortical arteries that supply the subcortical white matter underlies the link between white matter L-PVS and microbleeds.35, 36 Of note, however, the lack of an association of white matter L-PVS with incident subcortical infarcts or WMH progression could be potentially due to low statistical power.

The associations of L-PVS with a greater decline in processing speed and higher risk of VaD were independent of MRI markers of cerebrovascular disease, suggesting they were not simply due to confounding by other vascular mechanisms. Further, the associations remain significant for L-PVS in basal ganglia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SVD contributes to a profile of vascular-related cognitive impairment 2, 37 and suggest that L-PVS may be part of the pathologic spectrum linking hypertension/arteriosclerosis to VaD. Alternatively, the observed associations could be secondary to inflammatory cell accumulation and microglial activation,3, 38, 39 which may be another common pathophysiological mechanism shared by L-PVS and cognitive deterioration. However, additionally controlling for circulating C-reactive protein or white blood cell count did not alter these associations.

Major strengths of the present study include the large population-based sample of old people free from dementia at baseline and followed for 5 years on average, the use of standard MRI and reliable assessment of MRI lesions as well as the extensive characterization of participants that enabled us to adjust for a series of potential confounders. Our study has several limitations. First, cohort members included in the analysis were younger, more educated and healthier at baseline than those with missing data(eTable 1). Indeed, people with worse vascular risk profile or more severe SVD (those more likely to develop cognitive decline and dementia) died or were lost to follow-up before they could be recruited into the follow-up examination. This attrition may affect our estimates. If those excluded were similarly affected by L-PVS as those included in the analysis, the significance of results would have been underestimated. Second, there has been no established, gold standard methodological approach for PVS visual rating.3 Although we took into account the 2013 guidelines on Standards for Reporting Vascular changes on Neuroimaging18 in defining L-PVS, our L-PVS scale was developed in-house in 2004, so differs in several ways from more recent research; further cross-validation and reliability studies are needed. In particular, our protocol did not allow us to capture smaller PVS. Third, similar to other commonly used scales, we did not include L-PVS in the substantia innominate for basal ganglia rating. Fourth, pathology of L-PVS is progressive in nature and the cut-off in L-PVS number count is not easily chosen. Lastly, despite the meticulous efforts by trained graders, the potential misclassification of L-PVS versus lacunes or subcortical infarcts is unavoidable. For example, although subcortical infarcts on FLAIR generally have a hyperintense rim, the rim is not always present.18 The use of a 4 mm size criterion for infarcts may have resulted in some misclassification of infarcts as PVS.18 To better visualize smaller and large PVS along the vascular trunk for differential diagnosis with lacunes, future studies are needed that are based on quantitative techniques instead of visual rating scale,12 and on a 3D co-registered multi-sequence MRI imaging analysis.

In conclusion, L-PVS mark the progression of SVD and are associated with cognitive decline and VaD in older people. From a clinical perspective, our findings strengthen the notion that L-PVS serve as an MRI marker of SVD and suggest L-PVS (and the pathomechanisms leading to their dilatation) could be a potential target for therapies and prevention strategies of SVD and vascular-related cognitive impairment.

Key Points

Question

What is the effect of large MRI-visible perivascular spaces (L-PVS, diameters of &gt;3 mm) on progression of MRI hallmarks of cerebral small vessel disease, cognitive decline and dementia in a general population?

Findings

In this prospective population-based cohort study that included 2,612 older adults, LPVS prevalence was 16.2%. L-PVS predicted progression of subcortical infarcts, microbleeds and white matter hyperintensities, decline in information processing speed, and more than quadrupled the risk of vascular dementia over a 5-year follow-up.

Meaning

L-PVS are an MRI manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, which is a presumed anatomical basis for the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment.
