Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia worldwide. TDP-43 proteinopathy is reported to be associated with AD pathology is almost 50% of cases. Our exploratory study examined near end-stage (28 months old) mice selectively driving expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex in an APP/PSEN1 background. We hypothesized that hippocampal neuropathology caused by β-amyloidosis with TDP-43 proteinopathy induced in this model, resembling the pathology seen in AD cases, manifest with changes in resting state functional connectivity. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging and post-mortem histology were performed on four genotypes: wild type, APP/PSEN1, Camk2a/TDP-43, and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1. Our results revealed loss of functional coupling in hippocampus and amygdala and was associated with severe neuronal loss in dentate gyrus of Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice compared to APP/PSEN1 and wild type mice. The loss of cells was accompanied by high background of β-amyloid plaques with sparse phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology. The survival rate was also reduced in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice compared to other groups. This end-of-life study provides exploratory data to reach a better understanding of the role of TDP-43 hippocampal neuropathology in diseases with co-pathologies of TDP-43 proteinopathy and β-amyloidosis such as AD and limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).

1. Introduction

The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is aging; an estimated 30 million people are living with AD and over the next 30 years it is projected to increase to over 130 million worldwide [16]. AD consists of two molecular pathologies: 1) beta-amyloidosis which includes extracellular β-amyloid plaques and β-amyloid within blood vessels, and 2) tauopathy which includes intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques and neuropil threads. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein tau [10, 63]. These brain lesions have been referred to as Alzheimer’s disease neuropathological changes or ADNC [26, 45]. In late-onset sporadic AD, TDP-43 proteinopathy has been reported as an age-related copathology in up to 50% of cases [2, 6, 24, 30, 38, 59]. In some AD cases there is a reported discrepancy between severity of neuropathology and cognitive decline, which has been explained by comorbidity of AD and TDP-43 proteinopathy [46]. Cognitive decline and clinical findings are shown to be more severe when there is both ADNC and comorbid TDP-43 [33].

TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein of 43kDa) is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein that regulates RNA processing pathways such as mRNA splicing, RNA stability, transportation and transcriptional repression [11, 12, 58]. TDP-43 plays a role in mitophagy, autophagy, mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics, and cellular stress [13, 15, 64]. TDP-43 proteinopathy is defined as an abnormal accumulation of aggregated phosphorylated TDP-43 primarily in neuronal cytoplasmic and/or intranuclear inclusions [35, 39]. Glial TDP-43 pathology is present in Alzheimer’s disease but is more florid in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [48]. TDP-43 proteinopathy is the major pathology responsible for ~50% frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and 95% of ALS cases [5, 36, 48]. Recently a new TDP-43 proteinopathy was described, limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). This pathology has been associated with dementia in older patients, usually over 80 years, and presents with cognitive impairment and dementia similar to that of AD. The term neuropathological changes associated with LATE (LATE-NC) is used for TDP-43 proteinopathy in patients older than 80 years [47].

Hippocampal atrophy and total brain atrophy are consistent findings in neuroimaging studies of AD and have been proposed as a biomarker to detect the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical AD [27]. Resting state BOLD functional connectivity (rsFC) studies report decreased bilateral hippocampal coupling to other brain regions [1, 60]. When combined, ADNC and TDP-43 are associated with more severe structural changes in the hippocampus than either alone [32, 33]. While there are numerous imaging studies of AD pointing to a reduction in hippocampal volume and loss of connectivity, it is still unknown how much of the pathology and dementia is attributable to TDP-43 proteinopathy. There is only one study, of which we are aware, using MRI that clearly delineates the contribution in TDP-43 to dementia in AD. Josephs and colleagues undertook an MRI-histological analysis of subjects with antemortem imaging data and found an association of ADNC and TDP-43 proteinopathy, an association later considered to be LATE-NC and a significant factor related to increased rates of hippocampal atrophy. They also noted the current inability to assess TDP-43 pathology in vivo, and the absence of imaging or other biomarkers for a definitive diagnosis and a better understanding of disease progression [47].

To address these issues, we developed a mouse model to selectively drive expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus of an APP/PSEN1 transgenic mouse model of β-amyloidosis. Voxel based morphometry and rsFC were used to assess hippocampal volume and functional coupling, respectively. It was hypothesized that the expression of both genotypes would show exacerbated hippocampal neuropathology associated with related changes in functional connectivity compared to either one alone. Since age is the greatest risk factor for dementia, the study was performed at end-of-life, when mice were 28 months of age.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. Animals

All mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background. The C57BL/6J strain is resistant to transactivator (tTA) cellular degeneration [34]. We used the forebrain-specific calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II alpha (Camk2a-tTA) (Jackson Lab, 007004) mice to selectively drive human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex [42]. Even though there is evidence of Camk2a expression in other areas of brain such as cerebellum, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus, the Camk2a promoter predominantly drives expression in forebrain and hippocampus. This promoter has been used in several animal models to induce pathology in the hippocampus [61].

The APP/PSEN1ΔE9 (APP/PSEN1) (Jackson Lab, 005864) mice and TetO-hTDP-43 mice (developed by M. Gitcho and N. Cairns) were also used in this study [14, 28]. As previously described, the double transgenic APP/PSEN1/Camk2a-tTA was generated then crossed with tetO-hTDP-43 with doxycycline (DOX, 200mg/kg, Bio-Serv #S3888) diet during mating until weaned (~22 days of age) to suppress gene expression. The DOX chow was then replaced with regular chow selectively inducing expression of human TDP-43 in the hippocampus and cortex. The following genotypes were generated: wild type (3M, 2F), APP/PSEN1(2M, 3F), Camk2a/TDP-43(1M, 4F), and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1(2M, 3F), (n=5/genotype). Sex differences were not assessed; both male and female mice were evaluated together for each genotype. These mice were part of a life-long developmental study for which molecular and pathological data have been published on earlier time periods [14, 15].

Researchers from the Jackson lab recently mapped the Camk2a-tTA line to chromosome 12 and they discovered it to be inserted into 6 possible gene-coding regions [20]. Although this model has been used for over 20 years, with our previous study in 9 months old mice we evaluated mRNA (Affymetrix, Exon Array) and all 6 genes that were shown to be disrupted by the Camk2a-tTA insertion revealed no significant change in splicing or expression levels when comparing wild type to Camk2a/TDP-43, and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 respectively [14].

This Camk2a/TDP-43 model is a low expressing model of TDP-43 proteinopathy as opposed to other TDP-43 models such as TDP-43ΔNLS [3, 62]. We have reported TDP-43 pathology in our Camk2a/TDP-43 model including presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 at earlier time points (9 months old). Due to the low expressing feature of this model, we were able to age these mice to 28 months to study functional connectivity and pathological changes of TDP-43 associated with aging. Imaging was only possible at the end-of-life stage as mice had to be transported to the Northeastern University Center for Translational NeuroImaging for scanning followed by euthanasia. All mice were approximately 28 months old when evaluated by MRI and pathology. At the time of imaging, we found that 9 out of 20 mice had large invasive brain tumors and these were excluded from the imaging component of this study. This resulted in a small sample size of n=3 in each genotype group. Hence, this study is solely to report the exploratory data and results of our imaging and histological evaluations of this model (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Imaging sessions were conducted using a Bruker Biospec 7.0T/20-cm USR horizontal magnet (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) and a 20-G/cm magnetic field gradient insert (ID = 12 cm) capable of a 120-μs rise time as previously described [17]. Radio frequency signals were sent and received with a quadrature volume coil built into the animal restrainer (Animal Imaging Research, Holden, MA, USA). The design of the restraining system included a padded head support obviating the need for ear bars helping to reduce animal discomfort while minimizing motion artifact. All mice were imaged while under anesthesia for a maximum of 1 hour. At the beginning of each imaging session, a high-resolution anatomical data set was collected for volumetric analysis using the RARE pulse sequence with the following parameters: 35 slices of 0.7 mm thickness; field of view [FOV] 3 cm; 256 × 256; a repetition time [TR] of 3900msec; an effective echo time [TE] of 48msec, and NEX of 3; 6min 14sec acquisition time. For complete methods for voxel-based morphometry, resting state functional connectivity, histology, survival, and statistical analysis please see supplementary material.

3. Results

3.1. Voxel Based Morphometry

We evaluated the volumes of 140 ROIs for each sample in each genotype group. The total brain volume in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice (mean=317.4±5.63mm3) compared to our wild type group (mean=382.4±2.46 mm3) was markedly reduced (P-value=0.0005). This reduction in total brain volume was also identified when we compared our Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 group to APP/PSEN1 (mean=380.1±17.25mm3) (P-value=0.025). Even though we observed differences in volumes of several ROIs including CA1 and dentate gyrus (Supplementary Table 1), after normalizing ROIs to brain volume for each individual, no significant differences were detected in hippocampal size between the groups (Supplementary Fig. 2). Looking at other areas of brain, such as primary somatosensory cortex and amygdala, we did not observe any significant changes in volumes.

3.2. Resting State Functional Connectivity

Correlation matrices were used to compare wild type with Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 and APP/PSEN1 for 128 brain areas (Fig. 1). The diagonal line separates the two genotypes in each matrix. Each colored pixel denotes a brain area with a significant positive (yellow/red) or negative (blue) correlation with another brain area. The pixel locations across the diagonal line are mirror images of each other providing a visible assessment of the overall difference in connectivity between genotypes. For example, the left matrix shows that Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice have many fewer brain areas that are functionally coupled than wild type. The differences in connectivity between APP/PSEN1 and wild type are fewer. Brain areas with significant correlations often appear as clusters because they are likely to be contiguous by neuroanatomy and function. The delineated, labeled areas highlight clusters that are similar or, in many cases as in the comparisons between wild type and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 on the left, very different. For example, area (H) comprises the brain areas that make up the hippocampal complex, e.g. dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields. In wild type and APP/PSEN1 they are significantly coupled but not in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN. In brain areas that comprise the brainstem reticular activating system (J), both genotypes have reduced coupling as compared to wild type. We noted that the negative connectivity in (E) represented connections between the hypothalamus/thalamus and the basal ganglia. The same negative connectivity or functional decoupling also appears in (G) between the cerebellum and the basal ganglia.

Connectivity with the dentate gyrus differed between genotypes (Fig. 2). The Table lists brain areas significantly coupled to the dentate gyrus for each genotype together with their Z value. Areas that comprise the hippocampal complex (CA1, CA3, subiculum) and their connections (medial mammillary nucleus, reuniens nucleus and entorhinal cortex) are included in the Table. Wild type (WT) has three connections to these areas and another three to the cerebellum and olivary nucleus. Interestingly, the dentate gyrus in wild type had a negative correlation (highlighted in blue) to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and auditory cortex. APP/PSEN1 (APP) have a total of 13 significant functional connections including almost all of the hippocampal formation and several areas of the thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus, zona incerta, and lateral posterior nucleus). The Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 (APP/TDP) showed hypoconnectivity relative to the other genotypes. The hippocampal complex and its connections are all but uncoupled with the exception of CA3. The 3D reconstructs summarize the organization of these brain regions for each genotype. The location of the dentate gyrus is shown in red and acts as a nodal point around which the other brain areas cluster.

Several brain areas were significantly coupled to the medial amygdala in each of the three genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 3). Wild type (WT) presented with coupling to other areas of the amygdala (central, basal, and extended nuclei) and hypothalamus and thalamus. Wild type group shows negative coupling to the lateral septum and median raphé nucleus. APP/PSEN1 (APP) also show coupling to the surrounding amygdala and the hippocampus. Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1(APP/TDP) show loss of connectivity to all these areas with the exception of the central amygdala and olfactory cortex.

3.3. Postmortem Histology

Histology was performed on 28-month-old subjects. H&amp;E staining of hippocampus shows severe neuronal loss throughout the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus in Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice compared to wild type and APP/PSEN1 (Supplementary Fig. 4). We counted the neuronal cell nuclei in the dentate gyrus (n=3/genotype), and analyzed the data using one-way ANOVA; nuclei count was reduced in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 group (Fig. 3A). Since we did not detect any sign of tumoral invasion or metastasis to the hippocampal structures on our imaging and histological evaluation, we performed additional analysis including all samples in each group (n=5/genotype). Here, the number of nuclei was lower in Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 group in comparison to APP/PSEN1 and wild type. Despite the low sample size in both of our analysis, the nuclei count was significantly reduced in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 compared to APP/PSEN1 and wild type (Fig. 3B). Numbers of β-amyloid plaques were significantly (p-value=0.03) reduced in mice expressing TDP-43 in an APP/PSEN1 (mean ± SD = 29±39.5, n=5) background compared to APP/PSEN1(mean ± SD = 45.2 ± 461.2, n=5) (Fig. 4A–C). In addition, the mean plaque size appeared to increase though this was not significant (Fig. 4A, B, D).

Total TDP-43 staining observed in the dentate granule in the Camk2a/TDP-43 (Supplementary Fig. 5I), and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 expressing mice (Supplementary Fig. 5M) show no increase in cytoplasmic accumulation. As expected, β-amyloid plaques can be seen only in the APP/PSEN1 genotype and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 genotype (Supplementary Fig. 5F, N) but not in the wild type (Supplementary Fig. 5B) or Camk2a/TDP-43 alone (Supplementary Fig. 5J). The TDP-43 localization was limited to nuclei and some β-amyloid plaques with rare cytoplasmic expression. This occasional diffuse TDP-43 staining seen in some β-amyloid plaques may be some accumulation of TDP-43, an artifact or the sequalae of cell death in these end-stage mice. Cytoplasmic phosphorylated TDP-43 inclusions were not abundant in these aged mice (Supplementary Fig. 5Q–S). The scarcity of TDP-43 pathology in this aged model may be due to low level of transgene expression in this model coupled with severe neuronal loss evident (Fig. 3). When staining for β-amyloid (6E10) and TDP-43, we observed no colocalization with TDP-43 as seen in amyloid positive thioflavin S staining (Supplementary Fig. 6). It has previously been reported that some pathological TDP-43 in a few ALS cases colocalize with thioflavin S, a non-specific stain for amyloid [51]. This observation indicates that a proportion of pathological TDP-43 in these aged mice resembles amyloid seen in a some TDP-43 proteinopathies.

Astrocytes and microglial cells were enhanced in the areas of marked neuronal loss around the dentate gyrus in Camk2a/TDP-43 and more prominently in the Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 group. In APP/PSEN1, gliosis was evident around β-amyloid plaques, but not in wild type mice (Supplementary Fig. 7).

In cortex and amygdala we observed pyknotic nuclei, indicative of neurodegeneration, especially in Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1(Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9). There was modest TDP-43 proteinopathy in cortical areas of Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice. GFAP immunofluorescence revealed aggregation of astrocytes around β-amyloid plaques in the APP/PSEN1 group. Astrogliosis and microgliosis were observed in cortical regions of Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice, similar to changes seen in hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 10).

3.4. Survival

The following genotypes were evaluated over their lifetime: wild type (n=57), APP/PSEN1 (n=61), Camk2a/TDP-43 (n=36) and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 (n=21). The median survival age was significantly reduced in mice expressing TDP-43 in an APP/PSEN1 background. Median survival was observed in the following genotypes: wild type (29 months), APP/PSEN1 (29 months), Camk2a/TDP-43 (28.7 months), and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 (26.4 months). There was a significant decline in the life span of Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 compared to all groups evaluated. In mice expressing TDP-43 and APP/PSEN1 alone their survival was similar to wild type controls (Fig. 4E).

4. Discussion

TDP-43 is present in up to half of all AD cases, both sporadic cases and familial AD [2, 6, 24, 30, 38, 59]. These studies indicate that some of the neurodegeneration in AD with comorbid TDP-43 may be explained by TDP-43 proteinopathy To investigate the mechanisms by which TDP-43 proteinopathy may contribute to neurodegeneration in the context of AD we used relevant mouse models. In this study, we used fMRI to assess structural and functional changes in the hippocampus of 28-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice with and without overexpression of TDP-43. The presence of TDP-43 appears to exacerbate hippocampal pathology in mice with a background of APP/PSEN1. This finding is put into context with respect to cognitive dysfunction and histopathology in very old, end-of-life mice.

In this exploratory study with a focus on the effect of aging, we examined the Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 transgenic mouse at 28 months old to investigate the impact of TDP-43 pathology and aging on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and the structure of the brain. Histological evaluation of our aged model of Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 revealed severe neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus; these changes were most prominent in the dentate gyrus. Neuronal loss and astrogliosis in hippocampus are common histological findings in both ADNC and LATE-NC, two age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Although pathological hallmarks of TDP-43 proteinopathy including cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and phosphorylated TDP-43 were not abundant in our mice, we have shown previously that TDP-43 proteinopathy is present in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice at younger ages. The data from the current study suggests that the scarcity of inclusion bodies may simply reflect severe neuronal loss in this aged model. In APP/PSEN1 mice alone there is no apparent neuronal loss, but both Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice show severe neuronal loss which indicates that neuronal death is the outcome of TDP-43 overexpression. In some ALS cases with severe motor neuron loss TDP-43 pathology is often reported to be sparse [18].

Interestingly, it is not until TDP-43 is expressed in APP/PSEN1 mice that we see a significant reduction in life span (Fig. 4E). The survival was also reduced in the Camk2a/TDP-43 group but it is aggravated by the presence of TDP-43 proteinopathy and β-amyloidosis in the Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice. This is another implication of the synergistic effect of TDP-43 overexpression and β-amyloidosis in this model that alters markedly the life span in these transgenic mice.

Brain atrophy and reduction in hippocampus volume are features of AD [37]. In a developmental study ending at 21 months of age, Redwine and colleagues reported a progressive decrease in hippocampal volume in APP mice that occurred before the appearance of β-amyloid plaques [50]. However, studies with APP/PSEN1 mice report an increase in the volume of the hippocampal complex with aging that is significantly greater than wild type, a result thought to be due to the marked beta-amyloidosis and gliosis in these transgenic animals [40]. We did not observe any changes in volume of hippocampal structures or cortical regions in our study.

The first study to use resting state BOLD functional MRI in a mouse model of AD was by Shah and colleagues and they reported a decrease in hippocampal interhemispheric coupling in APP/PSEN1 mice around 19 months of age [54]. In a longitudinal study in TG2576 mice Shah and colleagues also reported a transition from hypersynchronous coupling in the hippocampal network at 5 months of age to a decrease at 8 and 18 months of age [55]. At around 6 months of age Tet-Off APP transgenic mice present with an overall hypoconnectivity in brain circuits associated with widespread deposition of Aβ plaques [7]. ArcAβ mice, at 14 months of age, present with loss of network connectivity with the hippocampus coincident with intracellular Aβ aggregates [22]. The TgF344-AD rat model of AD, which has human APP and PSEN1 genes, presents with a progressive decrease in hippocampal connectivity from 6 to 18 months of age [4]. These rsFC studies on different rodent models of AD, in general, reflect the human data reporting loss of functional coupling in the hippocampal complex with aging [25].

In our study, we present exploratory data which expands our knowledge of the functional connectivity of the brain in a mouse model of AD and TDP-43 proteinopathy. Due to the small sample sizes, we could not determine if there were significant differences between wild type and APP/PSEN1. Nevertheless, our data indicate coupling between dentate gyrus and the hippocampus, thalamus, cortex and cerebellum in APP/PSEN1 and controls (Figs. 1 and 2). More specifically, we observed differences in connectivity between the reticular nucleus of the thalamus and hypothalamus (F), (I) connections between deep cerebellar nuclei and hippocampus, (J) brainstems reticular activating system, and (K) periaqueductal gray, and there was less coupling in the mesencephalic reticular system in APP/PSEN1 mice. While the similarities and differences between wild type and APP/PSEN1 are not obvious from the correlation matrix this is not true for Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 where there appears to be a global loss of functional coupling. It is conceivable that this significant loss of connectivity may be caused by TDP-43 proteinopathy. The rsFC data were collected under light isoflurane anesthesia. Indeed, all of the studies cited above on rsFC in rodents were performed under anesthesia. The rsFC data were collected under low dose isoflurane anesthesia to minimize motion artifact and physiological stress [23]. While the BOLD signal is reduced with anesthesia, studies comparing the anesthetized and conscious states show similar rsFC data [21, 31].

Although there are a few studies reporting changes in functional connectivity in TDP-43 proteinopathy in ALS and FTLD [52, 53], there are only sparse data about functional connectivity of different brain regions with comorbid β-amyloidosis and TDP-43 pathology. In this study, these couplings are greatly reduced in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 as compared to the other genotypes. The same hypoconnectivity in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 is true for the medial amygdala (Supplementary Fig. 3). The amygdala is of particular interest in MRI studies of cases with AD and TDP-43 proteinopathy. It has been shown that neuropathological changes induced by TDP-43 proteinopathy negatively correlate with amygdala volume and global cognitive functions [41]. Loss of resting state BOLD functional coupling between the amygdala and the hippocampus is anticipated to be a likely biomarker in the diagnosis of LATE [47].

Despite the hypoconnectivity of amygdala seen in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1, neuronal loss and TDP-43 pathology of the amygdaloid complex seen in LATE was absent in our model. There does appear to be progressively more condensed nuclei in Camk2a/TDP-43 and TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice, which may contribute to the hypoconnectivity observed (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Aβ plaques start to form in APP/PSEN1 mice at about 4 months of age and, similar to AD, continue to accumulate with age [28, 29]. In our previous studies, we show that 9 months old mice overexpressing TDP-43 selectively in the hippocampus in an APP/PSEN1 background have a decrease in Aβ plaque deposition due to endosomal localization possibly altering APP processing. In 9 month old mice, we observed some thioflavin S staining colocalized with phosphorylated endogenous tau, a change in beta-amyloid plaque deposition, but no neuronal death [14]. Accordingly, in this study as well, the numbers of plaques were significantly reduced in mice expressing TDP-43 in an APP/PSEN1 (Fig. 4A–D). TDP-43 and thioflavin-S shows some diffuse cytosolic colocalization in Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice, which may indicate aggregation associated with TDP-43 expression. This beta-amyloid-binding property of TDP-43 proteinopathy was observed previously in a few cases of FTLD-TDP and ALS [9, 51]. Aging is also accompanied by age-related degenerative changes in brain tissue such as lipofuscin accumulation and granular deposits [57]. Due to autofluorescent feature of lipofuscin, quantification of the immunofluorescence staining in these samples was problematic.

These data collected at end-of-life were part of a developmental study following histopathology to better understand the contribution TDP-43 proteinopathy makes to hippocampal neuropathology in AD. A major portion of this work collected at nine months of age has been published [14] and while it would have been ideal to use non-invasive multimodal imaging to follow disease progression over the life of these mice the opportunity for imaging was only made available in the final months of this 28-month-long study. Prospective, longitudinal studies on aging necessitate the use of large numbers of animals as they are sacrificed at different developmental time points for post-mortem histology. These studies were designed to end with 5–6 male/female mice per group at 28 months of age. The loss of almost half of these mice to unforeseen brain tumors was unfortunate as it eliminated the Camk2a/TDP-43 group from the imaging arm of the study and limited the other groups to n = 3, making comparison between wild type and APP/PSEN1 inconclusive and relied on the gross differences between wild type and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 to evaluate the effect of TDP-43 on hippocampal pathology. Despite the limitation imposed on the imaging, we were able to collect histological data from all animals that underwent imaging.

Aging studies show that C57BL/6J mice at ~28 months of age accumulate tumors most likely due to a high mutation rate [65]. As in mice and humans, somatic mutations and cancer rates increase over the lifespan [43, 44]. Aging may also contribute to tumorigenesis and these finding are consistent with our observations in these extremely old mice. Most of the tumors were found on the ventral surface of the brain and H&amp;E staining revealed abnormal brain infiltration, fibrosis, several mitoses, increased cellularity, and areas of necrosis. The pathological findings are consistent with that of a meningioma (Supplementary Fig. 1U,V).

We used both male and female mice for this study but by the end of life we did not have enough animals to evaluate each sex separately. Some studies report sex differences in FTLD where males are more susceptible but others show no difference [8, 19]. In ALS, males have a higher incidence compared with females (reviewed in [49]). In Alzheimer’s disease women with dementia outnumber men almost two-fold [56]. It is important to increasing the numbers evaluated understand sex differences for future end of life studies

Animal models are essential in studying the pathogenesis of proteinopathies in neurodegenerative diseases and therapeutic development, but there are substantial limitations with these models. In our aged mouse model, tau pathology an underlying proteinopathy associated with aging seen in ADNC and a common copathology in LATE-NC was absent. Neurofibrillary changes associated with tau could alter the dynamics of TDP-43 and beta-amyloid copathologies observed in this model. Despite the evidence of neurodegeneration induced by TDP-43 pathology, cytoplasmic inclusions the pathological hallmark of TDP-43 proteinopathy in human was missing in our transgenic model. Furthermore, the behavioral and cognitive changes associated with these pathologies in AD patients was not assessed in this transgenic model due to limited motor function in this aged model.

Overall, this model displays several hallmarks of neurodegeneration. This end-stage model may hold clues to understanding the pathogenesis of LATE and the role TDP-43 plays in AD. This may lead the way to the development of biomarkers, and identify potential new targets for therapeutic intervention.

5. Conclusion

Our aged mouse model expressing TDP-43 in an APP/PSEN1 background has several features associated with neurodegeneration, including pathology of limbic structures such as functional decoupling of amygdala and dentate gyrus, severe neuronal loss due to TDP-43 proteinopathy and comorbid β-amyloidosis. From this exploratory study, despite the limitations that our aged model carries such as scarcity of detectable phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology, this is a functionally affected model that captures the impairments of functional communication of brain networks in TDP-43 pathology. Assessment of histology and MRI derived resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) at different timepoints during the aging process may help us capture a timepoint in which our model presents both pathological and functional hallmarks of TDP-43 pathology. We also propose that loss of connectivity as measured by functional MRI can be considered as a biomarker to detect these pathologies, while histological evaluation and behavior testing are unavailable or inconclusive. We believe this model can be further studied as a potential mouse model co-morbid β-amyloidosis and TDP-43 proteinopathy including LATE and AD.

Fig. 1. Correlation Matrices.

Shown are correlation matrices of 128 mouse brain areas for rsFC comparing wild type (n=3) vs Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 (n=3) and wild type vs APP/PSEN1 (n=3). Z scores of Pearson’s correlation coefficients for both matrices are displayed in the color-coded matrix. Greater absolute Z values indicate greater connections between two region pairs, while smaller absolute Z values indicate weaker connections or negative correlations (blue). Significant correlations passing threshold (|Z| &gt; 2.3) are shown in the matrix. Labels: A - Connections between striatum and preoptic area; B - Connections between claustrum and accumbens/septum; C - Connections between prefrontal ctx (prelimbic, infralimbic, tenia tecta, orbital ctx) and accumbens/septum; D - Endopiriform, claustrum, rostral piriform, insula; E - Connections between hypothalamus/thalamus and basal ganglia; F - Connections between reticular n. thalamus and hypothalamus; G - Cerebellar connections to basal ganglia; H - Hippocampus (dentate, CA1, CA3); I - Connections between deep cerebellar n. and hippocampus; J - Brainstem reticular activating system; K - Periaqueductal gray, mesencephalic reticular system; L - Connections between raphe n. and superior colliculus/interpeduncular n.

Fig. 2. Connectivity to Dentate Gyrus.

Shown in the tables are brain areas with significant correlations (IZI &gt; 2.3) to the dentate nucleus for wild type (WT), APP/PSEN1 (APP) and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 (APP/TDP). N = 3 for each genotype. The brains areas for each genotype are summarized in the 3D colored-coded reconstructions below highlighting the different brain regions.

Fig. 3. Severe neuronal loss observed in dentate gyrus of Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice.

Using DAPI to stain the nuclei and then counting the nuclei in dentate gyrus area in (A) samples without the tumors (n=3/genotype) and (B) all the samples in each genotype group (n=5/genotype) showed significant reduction in number of nuclei in Camk2a/TDP-43 and Camk2a/TDP- 43/APP/PSEN1 group compared to APP/PSEN1 and wild type. There was no significant difference between APP/PSEN1 and wild type group. We used one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc tests for statistical analysis. Scale bar:50μm

Figure 4. Amyloid plaque deposition and survival reduced in TDP-43 expressing mice.

Immunofluorescence staining of hippocampal section (40X) for amyloid plaques with 1% aqueous thioflavin-S in (A) APP/PSEN1 and (B) Camk2a/TDP-43/APP/PSEN1 mice (n=5/genotype). (C) Number of plaques and (D) mean plaque area (μm2) in hippocampal area were analyzed using parametric t-test (plaques smaller than 50μm2 excluded from the quantification), Scale bar; B:200μm. (E) TDP-43 expression reduces life span when expressed in an APP/PSEN1 background. A Kaplan-Meier curve displays survival results for the following genotype: wild type (n=57), Camk2a/TDP-43 (n=36), APP/PSEN1 (n=61), and Camk2a/TDP-43.APP/PSEN1 (n=21).
