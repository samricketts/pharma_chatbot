Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly, has traditionally been considered a disease of neurons. Structural and function alterations of cerebral blood vessels also occur, but direct evidence of a causal involvement in the pathobiology of the disease has been lacking. This Viewpoint will review new data that may help shed light into the intriguing association between vascular and neurodegenerative pathology.

Dementia
vascular cognitive impairment
vascular risk factors

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of age-related cognitive impairment, has emerged as a leading health challenge of our times. Afflicting nearly 6 million people in the US, at a staggering cost of $259 billion, AD has risen to be the 6th most common cause of death (http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia). Although there is evidence of a decrease in incidence1, due to demographic shifts and lack of disease-modifying treatments the number of affected individuals is anticipated to approach 150 million worldwide by 2050 (http://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia).

AD has traditionally been considered a “neurodegenerative” disease affecting neurons, but alterations of the cerebral macro- and micro-vasculature are also present. Considering the brain’s critical dependence on a finely-regulated blood supply and blood-brain barrier (BBB) exchange2, these vascular alterations could play a role in the neuronal dysfunction and damage underlying the dementia. However, it remains unclear whether the vascular changes interact with the neurodegenerative process or act independently through hypoxic-ischemic damage. In this viewpoint, we will briefly review recent epidemiological, imaging, and basic science developments to provide an updated assessment of the vascular contributions to AD and flesh out questions still outstanding.

The classic neuropathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques consist mainly of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ), a 40–42 aminoacid peptide cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP)3. Neurofibrillary tangles are intraneuronal aggregates of the microtubule associated protein tau, which undergo excessive phosphorylation and aggregation3. Lower order aggregates (oligomers) of Aβ and tau, rather than plaques and tangles per se, are thought to mediate cognitive impairment in AD by disrupting synaptic function in critical brain regions3. In familial AD, in which there are mutations of the APP gene, amyloid accumulation results from increased Aβ production3, but in the more common sporadic forms there is a failure of Aβ clearance3. On these bases, AD has traditionally been considered strictly a neurodegenerative disease.

Contrary to this view, only 24% of patients with dementia have pure AD pathology (plaques and tangles), whereas over 50% have vascular lesions (micro- and macro-infarcts, microhemorrhages, lacunar strokes, and white matter lesions), either alone or in association with AD pathology4. Furthermore, large and small cerebral arteries of patients with AD have more atherosclerosis5. Therefore, mixed dementia encompassing both AD and vascular pathology is the most common cause of age-related dementia, especially in older individuals.

Epidemiological and imaging studies also point to vascular dysfunction and damage in AD. Thus, vascular risk factors, such as midlife hypertension, obesity, diabetes are each associated not only with an elevated risk of dementia6, but also with a 2–3 fold increased risk of elevated cerebral amyloid later in life (evaluated by positron emission tomography, PET)7. Furthermore, presymptomatic individuals at risk for AD exhibit cerebrovascular dysfunction, reduced CBF8, and altered BBB permeability2. These observations have raised the possibility that cerebrovascular dysfunction is a presymptomatic correlate of AD pathology8.

Experimental data also suggest a vascular contribution to AD pathology. Transgenic mice with amyloid accumulation, have a profound disruption of neurovascular regulation prior to the expression of cognitive deficits and amyloid plaques2. Thus, the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) produced by neural activity and endothelial vasomotor function are markedly impaired, while cerebrovascular autoregulation is suspended rendering cerebral perfusion totally dependent on arterial blood pressure2. The neurovascular dysfunction is mediated by Aβ-induced activation of scavenger receptors on perivascular macrophages leading to radical formation though a Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase2. The resulting poly-ADP-ribose polymerase activation leads to endothelial Ca2+ overload and dysfunction via the transient potential receptor melastatin 22.

Collectively, this body of work has revealed a close association between vascular and AD pathology. But, the pathogenic significance of the association remains to be established, and a number of questions remain. For example:

Do vascular and AD pathologies interact, promoting each other?

Experimental studies suggest that Aβ can reduce CBF, induce neurovascular dysfunction and increase the susceptibility of the brain to ischemia2. Indeed, patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD have an increased stroke risk9, suggesting that AD pathology could promote vascular pathology (Figure 1). Conversely, there might be a mechanistic link between vascular factors and AD pathology. For example, while experimental hypertension increases Aβ production, the vascular damage produced by hypertension reduces the clearance of Aβ and possibly tau, promoting amyloid accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles2 (Figure 1). In support of this hypothesis, imaging and autopsy studies have shown evidence of increased amyloid or tau accumulation in participants with vascular risk factors7. Therefore, AD and vascular pathologies could interact enhancing each other, but more definitive evidence for a causal link between the two is lacking. For example, there is no evidence that hypoxia-ischemia increases amyloid tracers in patients10, and longitudinal studies indicate that vascular pathology develops independently of AD pathology, e.g., ref.11. However, studies using PET imaging with amyloid or tau tracers, which reflect aggregates, cannot exclude the possibility that monomeric or oligomeric Aβ or tau is increased by ischemia during critical periods of the disease process. Therefore, while biologically plausible, establishing a causal relationship between vascular factors and AD pathology in humans has been challenging. More sensitive biomarkers of soluble Aβ and tau, either via PET or using cerebrospinal fluid, would help provide further insight into this issue.

What is the relative impact of vascular and AD pathology on cognition?

AD and vascular pathology could each contribute to the cognitive demise in an additive fashion or act synergistically to enhance their respective impacts. Some studies have suggested that vascular pathology may amplify the deleterious effect of AD pathology, consistent with the interaction between vascular and AD pathology mentioned above (Figure 1). For example, given the same degree of AD pathology, vascular lesions with minimal or no impact on cognition may result in more severe dementia4. On the other hand, the two processes could be simply additive: the cognitive impact of vascular lesions summing up with that of AD pathology. Such a scenario has been suggested by studies demonstrating that the vascular pathology aggravates the expression of the cognitive impairment independently of AD pathology12. However, investigating these relationships in vivo is challenging, since the relative contribution of the two pathologies is likely to vary from patient to patient depending on the type and location of vascular pathology, genetic background, degree of AD pathology, and cognitive reserve. Vascular pathology can be diffuse, e.g., microinfarcts and microhemorrhages, or targeted to brain regions subserving specific cognitive domains13. It is conceivable that the reduction in connectivity caused by white matter pathology could enhance the impact of AD pathology by impairing the recruitment of alternative cognitive networks or developing cognitive strategies to overcome the deficits. Cognitive reserve, determining the ability of the brain to cope with pathology, and ApoE genotype may also influencethe threshold for expression of the cognitive deficits. Therefore, the nature and topology of the vascular pathology may determine cognitive impact of AD pathology, depending on cognitive reserve.

Does promoting vascular health help stave off AD?

One major motivation for a research focus on the vascular contribution to AD is the therapeutic potential. Although AD pathology is currently untreatable, vascular risk factors are treatable or even preventable. Despite compelling evidence of an association and a biologically plausible mechanism behind this association, therapeutic translation of these concepts is limited by the lack of clinical trial data demonstrating a benefit from treatment of vascular risk factors on cognitive outcomes. Only one major trial to date, Syst-Eur14, demonstrated a reduction in dementia rates for individuals treated for hypertension, but actual event rates were low and these results have not been replicated in other trials. This discrepancy between observational longitudinal data and clinical trial results may be due to the need for a longer interval between vascular risk exposure and cognitive outcomes; risk factors are most strongly associated with late-life dementia when considered in midlife, and most trials do not extend from midlife through later-life. SPRINT-MIND is an ongoing trial, accompanying the SPRINT trial15, which will include cognitive outcomes and further address this important question. Ongoing trials considering multimodal therapies that address vascular risk factors and include lifestyle modifications might also help provide insight into ideal management of vascular risk and its potential impact on AD.

Conclusions

Vascular and neurodegenerative changes are distinct yet inextricably intertwined substrates of age-related cognitive impairment. But in what measure each pathology contributes to the clinical expression of the dementia has been difficult to assess in humans. While imaging studies have confirmed their association and potential interaction in vivo, more sophisticated biomarkers of vascular and neurodegenerative pathology, as well as longer lasting longitudinal studies are needed to more precisely define their respective impact on cognitive function. Considering that therapeutic approaches targeting neurodegeneration have not been successful to date, there is a strong rationale for adopting aggressive strategies to counteract vascular risk factors in midlife, to protect the brain for the cumulative effect of vascular damage on cognitive health later in life.

Figure 1 AD pathology leads to dysfunction and damage to cerebral blood vessels by inducing vascular dysregulation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and promoting atherosclerosis. In turn, poor vascular health promotes amyloid accumulation by increasing Aβ production and reducing its vascular clearance. The harmful effects of vascular and AD pathology converge on the brain to induce neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.
