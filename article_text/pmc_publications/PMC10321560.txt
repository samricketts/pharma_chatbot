INTRODUCTION:

The association of lifespan cognitive reserve (CR) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains controversial. We aimed to examine the association of lifespan CR indicator with the risk of MCI and its progression to dementia, taking brain pathologies into account.

METHODS:

In a community-based cohort study (mean age, 79 years) with annual follow-up (median, 5.16 years; maximum, 20 years), a cognitively intact group (n=1182) and an MCI group (n=420) were identified at baseline. During the follow-up, 611 participants died and underwent autopsies. CR indicator encompassing education, early- to late-life cognitive and social activities was obtained and tertiled.

RESULTS:

The multi-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of MCI was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58–0.90) in the cognitively intact group, and the HR of dementia was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.45–0.97) in the MCI group for participants with the highest CR indicator (reference: the lowest CR indicator). Among MCI participants with brain pathologies, dementia incidence was about 50% lower in people with the highest CR indicator than the lowest CR indicator.

DISCUSSION:

High lifespan CR indicator reduces risk of MCI, and delays its progression to dementia.

pmc1. Introduction

The term cognitive reserve (CR) refers to the adaptability (i.e., efficiency, capacity and flexibility) of cognitive processes to endure brain aging or pathology in order to minimize clinical manifestations [1, 2]. Few studies have shown that lifelong exposure to the CR-enhancing factors might reduce the risk of dementia in the non-demented or cognitively intact individuals [3–5]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate condition between normal cognition and dementia and is associated with an increased risk of dementia [6]. Previous studies have indicated that high education [7], and social, cognitive or intellectual activity [8–10] might be related to decreased incidence of MCI among cognitively intact individuals. So far, no studies have examined the association of lifespan CR indicator with the risk of MCI.

Several studies that have addressed the relationship between individual CR indicators and the progression from MCI to dementia in people with MCI have shown inconsistent results. One study has indicated that high education might delay the onset of dementia in people with MCI [11]. Others found that social or cognitive activities [10, 12] and education [13] were not associated with the conversion from MCI to dementia. According to the theory of CR, while greater CR could compensate for pathology at the onset of cognitive decline, once the reserve has reached the amount of pathology that can be compensated for, a more rapid rate of decline might be evident [1]. Open questions remain about whether high lifespan CR indicator could delay the progression from MCI to dementia, and the role of brain pathologies in the association is unknown.

Some proxy measures of high CR, such as high education attainment [14, 15], and frequent cognitive or social activities [16, 17] have been individually associated with a reduction in dementia risk. CR is dynamic construct and influenced by different exposures across the lifespan, and one reserve-enhancing factor during a certain time period alone could not fully explain the accumulation of cognitive activities over the life course [18, 19]. Therefore, several indicator factors covering different periods of life are typically used to define it.

In a recent study, we have found that high lifespan CR is associated with reduced risk of dementia, independently of brain pathologies [5]. In the present study, we sought to verify the hypothesis that high lifespan CR indicator is associated with a reduced risk of MCI, and may delay its progression to dementia, even in the presence of brain pathology, using data from a long-term community-based cohort study with the brain pathologies assessments.

2. Methods

2.1. Study design, setting and participants

The Rush Memory and Aging Project is an ongoing prospective study that investigates risk factors for common chronic neurodegenerative conditions in older adults [20]. At the time of enrollment and thereafter, all participants underwent a comprehensive clinical assessment, including medical history, neurological examination, and detailed cognitive function testing.

Beginning in 1997 through 2018, a total of 2022 participants enrolled. The participants underwent annual follow-up for a maximum of 20 years. Among all participants, after excluding 420 participants including 112 with prevalent dementia, 31 with mental disorder (using medications for mental disorders, such as anti-anxiety medications and antipsychotic medications etc.), 40 who died before the first follow-up evaluation, and 237 who had missing information on CR-enhancing factors, 1602 people were left for the current study.

Of the 1602 participants, two groups including a cognitively intact group (n=1182) and an MCI group (n=420) were identified at baseline. During the follow-up, 500 participants developed MCI and 45 participants had incident dementia without first having MCI in the cognitively intact group, and 178 developed dementia in the MCI group. Throughout the follow-up period, 747 participants died, of whom, 611 (81.79%) underwent autopsy (including 415 in the cognitively intact group and 196 in the MCI group) (Fig. 1).

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Anatomic Gift Act documentation was obtained from all participants who underwent autopsy.

2.2. Assessment of lifespan CR indicator

Data on educational and mentally stimulating activities (including education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, social activity and social network in late life) were acquired through personal interviews at the baseline [5]. More detailed information about the structured questionnaires is reported in APPENDIX A.

Years of education (mean=14.76 years, ranged 0–29 years) was calculated based on the number of years of regular school reported at baseline [21]. Early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities were assessed with a 37-item questionnaire. Item scores were averaged to yield separate early-life, midlife and late-life activity measures [22]. Higher scores indicated greater cognitive activity. Social activity in late life was assessed using a 6-item questionnaire. Item scores were summed and averaged to obtain a composite measure of social activity, with higher scores indicating greater social activity [23, 24]. Social network in late life was assessed by asking participants about the number of children participants have and meet monthly. Social network size was the number of these individuals (children, family, and friends) seen at least once per month [25].

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to construct the lifespan CR indicator. Education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, social activity and social network in late life were included in the model (APPENDIX B). As the factor loading of social network was low making the model fit unsatisfactory, it was excluded from the final model. The final CR indicator was generated from the best-fitting SEM with the five CR-enhancing factors (i.e., education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, and social activities in late life) [11] (Supplementary Fig. 1 in APPENDIX C). The weight for each of the 5 factors was the coefficient of the corresponding factor derived from the SEM with 0.065 for education, and 0.841 for early-life, 1.273 for midlife and 0.389 for late-life cognitive activities, as well as 0.212 for late life social activities. The lifespan CR indicator ranged from −8.00 to 5.81 with higher value indicating high level of CR accumulation across lifespan, and was operationalized as a continuous and a categorical variable (tertiled as lowest, middle and highest).

2.3. Assessment of dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, and MCI

Clinical diagnoses (MCI and dementia including Alzheimer’s and non-Alzheimer’s dementia) were rendered at every assessment based on a three-stage process, including computer scoring of cognitive tests, clinical judgment by a neuropsychologist, and diagnostic classification by a clinician. First, cognitive tests were administered by trained technicians and scored by a computer in SAS following the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) [26, 27]. Second, based on review of the data on all cognitive tests, computer generated impairment ratings, and data on education, occupation, sensory and motor deficits, and effort, the board-certified neuropsychologist rendered a clinical judgment regarding the presence of cognitive impairment, blinding to subject age, sex, and race [28]. Third, clinical diagnoses of dementia/ Alzheimer’s dementia were evaluated by a neurologist or geriatrician with expertise, based on criteria of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) [29].

The diagnosis of MCI was defined as having cognitive impairment without meeting criteria for a clinical diagnosis of dementia [30]. We previously showed that persons meeting these criteria were at a substantially increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia [31] and represented an intermediate group between persons without cognitive impairment and those with dementia in terms of brain pathology indices [32]. The characterization of MCI is similar to the condition otherwise known as “Cognitive Impaired Not Demented” (CIND) [33] and has been used in multiple prior publications [30, 34].

2.4. Assessment of brain pathologies

Postmortem neuropathological evaluations were conducted on the 611 brains (median of postmortem interval: 6.90 hours [interquartile range, IQR: 5.67–9.04]). Examiners followed a standard protocol for tissue preservation, tissue sectioning, and quantification of pathologic findings, as previously described in detail[35]. Global Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology burden, including β amyloid protein and neurofibrillary tangles was quantified, and dichotomized as being at low or high levels based on median [36]. Chronic infarcts including gross infarcts and microinfarcts [35], cerebral vascular disease pathology including atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [37], Lewy bodies [35] and typical hippocampal sclerosis [38] were assessed as present or absent.

2.5. Other variables assessments

Information on a broad range of potential confounders were collected at baseline, including age, sex, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke and Apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4. They were described in detail in APPENDIX D in the supplementary materials.

2.6. Statistical analysis

The characteristics of the study population by MCI/dementia were compared using t tests and nonparametric tests (chi-square, Fisher test and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests).

Incidence rates (IRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MCI or dementia per 1000 person-years were calculated for lifespan CR indicator categories using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for MCI or dementia incidence associated with the lifespan CR indicator. Follow-up time was calculated as the time from study entry to MCI/dementia diagnosis, death, or the last examination. The models were adjusted for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and APOE ɛ4. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also used to compare the cumulative probability of events among subjects in different groups. Among the participants with autopsies, IRs (95% CIs) of MCI or dementia were estimated for CR indicator categories by different levels of brain pathologies adjusting for age and sex, with Poisson regression considering the follow-up time as exposure variable. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs of the relationship between the burden of AD or other brain pathologies and CR indicator.

In supplementary analyses, the association between the lifespan CR indicator and progression from MCI to dementia was analyzed in the incident MCI cohort, derived from the cognitively intact cohort. In addition, sensitivity analyses on the association of lifespan CR indicator with MCI and its progression to dementia were performed including: 1) multiple imputation by chained equation (Markov chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) to impute missing values on BMI, heart disease and stroke, generating 5 completed datasets with age, sex, education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, social activity and social network in late life, diabetes, hypertension and APOE ɛ4 as covariates in the multiple imputation model; and 2) using competing risk model (the Fine-Gray model) with death as the competing event. The level of statistical significance was set at a P value less than 0.05. All analyses were performed with Stata SE, version 15.0 (Stata Corp LP., College Station, Texas, USA).

3. Results

3.1. Characteristics of the two group

At baseline, the 1602 dementia-free participants (1216 women and 386 men; mean [SD] age, 79.57 [7.50] years) included 1182 cognitively intact people and 420 MCI cases which constituted two groups for the longitudinal analyses. Table 1 presented the baseline characteristics of the study population by incident MCI in the cognitively intact group, and by incident dementia in the MCI group.

3.2. Lifespan CR indicator and MCI in the cognitively intact group

In the cognitively intact group, during the follow-up (median: 4.02 years, IQR: 1.99–7.32 years, accounting for 6064.61 person-years in total), 500 developed MCI, and 45 participants had only incident dementia without MCI detected. In multi-adjusted Cox models, the CR indicator (as continuous variable) was associated with a reduction in MCI risk (HR=0.95, 95% CI 0.91–0.98). Compared with those in the lowest CR indicator tertile, the HR (95% CI) of MCI was 0.72 (0.58–0.90) for participants in the highest CR indicator tertile, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and APOE ɛ4 (Table 2).

3.3. Lifespan CR indicator and dementia risk in the MCI group

In the MCI group (n=420), during the follow-up (median: 3.05 years, IQR: 1.77–6.02 years, accounting for 1810.60 person-years in total), 178 (42%) developed dementia, and 160 (38%) reverted to normal. In multi-adjusted Cox models, the CR indicator (as continuous variable) was associated with a reduction in dementia risk (HR=0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.99, P=.03) and Alzheimer’s dementia (HR=0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.99, P=.04). Compared to those in the lowest CR indicator tertile, the HRs (95% CIs) of dementia and Alzheimer’s dementia were 0.66 (0.45–0.97) and 0.67 (0.45–0.98) for participants in the highest CR indicator tertile, after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, and APOE ɛ4 (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1 in APPENDIX C ).

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that 25% people with MCI had incident dementia in 3.96 years among participants with the lowest CR indicator tertile, and in 11 years among participants with the highest CR indicator tertile, adjusted for age and sex. The highest CR indicator tertile may delay the progression from MCI to dementia by about 7 years compared to the lowest CR indicator tertile (χ2=6.80, P=.03) (Supplementary Fig. 2).

3.4. Role of brain pathologies in CR indicator-MCI/dementia association

Of the people who died, in the cognitively intact group, 415 underwent autopsies (230 having incident MCI and 30 having incident dementia without first having MCI), and in the MCI group, 196 underwent autopsies (111 having incident dementia).

Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that compared to lowest CR indicator tertile, highest CR indicator tertile at baseline were not related to the burden of AD pathology and most other brain pathologies in both the cognitively intact group and the MCI group, excepting for gross infarcts (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.27–0.76) in the cognitively intact group, after adjustment for potential confounders(Table 3).

In multi-adjusted Cox regression models, the association of highest CR indicator with MCI (HR=0.60, 95% CI 0.50–0.95) and dementia (HR=0.66, 95% CI 0.40–1.09) risk were not much altered, and remained significant after further adjustment for gross infarcts and global AD pathology (reference: lowest CR indicator) (Table 4).

In the cognitively intact group, 278 had high brain pathologies (high global AD pathology or/and present gross infarcts). Among the participants with both low and high brain pathologies, the incident rate of MCI was lower in people with highest CR indicator tertile adjusting for age and sex, compared to participants with lowest CR indicator, but it did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 2).

In the MCI group, 140 presented high brain pathologies. Of them, the incident rate of dementia was about 50–65% lower in those with highest CR indicator tertile (P&lt;0.05) compared to participants with lowest CR indicator tertile adjusting for age and sex (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table 3).

3.5. Supplementary analyses

The results of supplementary analyses were shown in the supplementary materials (see detail in APPENDIX E).

4. Discussion

In this community-based prospective study of dementia-free older adults comprising a cognitively intact group and an MCI group, we found that: 1) a high lifespan CR indicator consisting of education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, and social activities in late life, was associated with a reduction in MCI risk in cognitively intact people, 2) high lifespan CR indicator may delay the progression from MCI to dementia by about 7 years in people with MCI, and 3) the association between high lifespan CR indicator and the delayed progression from MCI to dementia remained significant in MCI people with high AD pathology or infarcts.

MCI represents an intermediate between normal cognitive function and clinical dementia [6]. To date, several longitudinal studies have addressed the association between CR indicator related factors and risk of MCI. Most of the studies suggested that frequent cognitive, social (in both midlife and late life) [8, 9] or intellectual activities [9, 10], high education [7], and composite CR score including education, reading and vocabulary measures [39], as proxy measures of high CR, were associated with a decreased risk of MCI. The role of individual CR related factors in the progression from MCI to dementia has been explored in few studies, with some inconsistent findings. One study showed that higher education or vocabulary scores may delay clinical onset of dementia in people with MCI [11]. Another three studies suggested that that later life social or cognitive activities [12], intellectual social activities [10] and education [13] were not associated with the conversion from MCI to dementia. In addition, occupational attainment [40] and measurement of intelligence quotient [41] were risk factors for a higher rate of progression from MCI to Alzheimer’s dementia.

In the present study, in agreement with most of these studies, we observed that high levels of education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, and social activities in late life, were individually associated with a reduced risk of MCI. The associations between individual CR related factors and the MCI progression to dementia were relatively weaker or not significant. In our study, to capture CR accumulated through lifespan, we used SEM to extract the CR indicator based on life-course (through early, middle and late life) educational and mentally stimulating activities, and the measure was weighted according to its contribution to the score [9, 11]. Thus, it is not surprise that the association of lifespan CR indicator with MCI/dementia was stronger than that the association of individual CR-enhancing factors with MCI/dementia. Our results may argue that lifespan CR should be an active construct, and develops from continued life experiences [18, 19], thus, capturing CR-enhancing activities covering lifespan could be more relevant than using a factor at a single time window. In this study, we found that compared to lowest lifespan CR indicator, the highest lifespan CR indicator was associated with more than 20% decreased risk of MCI and delayed the progression from MCI to dementia by 7 years. To our knowledge, our study is the first study to examine the association of lifespan CR indicator with the risk of MCI and its progression to dementia. In addition, we assessed whether the associations could be driven by the CR-related factors at any specific life stage. We removed early-life measures, mid-life measure or late-life measures from SEM by a stepwise procedural, and the associations remained significant.

Since the CR hypothesis was proposed, several studies have explored whether CR related indicators could have a direct effect on neuropathology and resist to the accumulation of brain pathologies [42, 43], or just bypass brain pathologies [44, 45] and represent other pathways to compensate for or cope with brain pathologies. In the present study, we found that lifespan CR indicator was not associated with most brain pathologies in the cognitively intact individuals and people with MCI, excepting for gross infarcts. However, the associations of highest CR indicator with MCI and its conversion to dementia were independent of infarcts and AD pathology, supporting the CR hypothesis that CR might not effect classic brain pathologies directly and represent other pathways, such as enhancing brain network efficiency to compensate for the brain pathologies [1, 2]. In addition, we found that high CR indicator throughout life could also delay the progression from MCI to dementia in MCI people with high brain pathology, including AD pathology or infarcts. These results suggest that educational and mentally stimulating activities across the lifespan are of great importance to delay dementia onset even in people with MCI and high AD pathologies, given that there is no effective treatment for dementing disorders.

A notable strength of our study is the prospective community-based cohort with yearly follow-up examinations. Furthermore, the usage of latent factors could capture the comprehensive effect of multiple CR-enhancing factors across the lifespan. However, some limitations need to be pointed out. First, the participants were volunteers who were not randomly selected from the community, and were generally highly educated, older and primarily white. This limits our findings in being generalized to people from other socioeconomic or ethnic backgrounds and younger populations. Second, the brains of the participants were obtained and autopsied when the participants were deceased, and the exact brain pathological status at time of MCI diagnosis is unknown. Thus, the causal inference of the neuropathologic basis in the CR-dementia or CR-MCI association should be interpreted with cautions. Third, CR-related factors were assessed by retrospective self-report, which could be subject to measurement error. However, the use of a SEM-based latent variable approach might attenuate some measurement errors. In addition, CR is a theoretical and hypothetical construct; and well-defined and accepted measures have not been available yet. Moreover, there is no clear cutoff for the CR score, and the score varies when applied in different populations. Based on previous studies [3, 4], the CR score was tertiled (lowest, middle and highest). Fourth, about 75% participants were female in this study, but this is similar to that in other cohort study with similar age [3]. This could be explained by the fact that women live longer than men [46]. Moreover, because the dropouts were mainly due to poor health conditions, and participants who underwent autopsy were more likely to have higher levels of CR related factors, the given association in this study might have been underestimated. Finally, nonresponse bias might have occurred due to missing data. However, we repeated the analysis by multiple imputation for missing values, and the results were much similar to those in the initial analysis.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence of that a high lifespan CR indicator encompassing education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, and social activities in late life, is associated with a reduction in MCI risk and delays its progression to dementia. Moreover, the association between high lifespan CR indicator and delayed progression from MCI to dementia remained significant even in people with high AD pathology and infarcts suggesting that high CR indicator may delay dementia onset even in people with MCI and high brain pathologies. Our findings highlight that accumulating educational and mentally stimulating activities enhancing CR throughout life might be a feasible strategy in preventing dementing disorders. Further large population-based longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the mechanisms underlying the association between CR indicator and MCI.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: PubMed and Web of Science databases were systematically searched, and titles and abstracts were screened. Although few studies have shown that lifelong exposure to the CR-enhancing factors including education, cognitive or social activities is associated with a reduction in dementia risk among non-demented people, no studies have examined the impact of lifespan CR indicator on the risk of MCI and its progression to dementia taking into account brain pathologies.

Interpretation: This study provides evidence that high lifespan CR indicator encompassing education, early-life, midlife and late-life cognitive activities, and social activities in late life, is associated with a reduction in MCI risk and may substantially delay its progression to dementia. The association between high lifespan CR indicator and the delayed progression from MCI to dementia remained significant among people with MCI and high AD pathology or infarcts.

Future directions: Further large population-based longitudinal studies are warranted to detect the recipe of engagement in cognitive activities sufficient to impart the reserve against MCI and dementia.

Conflict of Interest: None reported.
