Purpose

We aimed to evaluate an automated technique to segment hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex (ERC) at 7 tesla MRI.

Materials and Methods

Cornu Ammonis (CA)1, CA2, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG), subiculum (SUB) and ERC were manually segmented, covering most of the long axis of the hippocampus, on 0.70 mm3 T2-weighted 7 tesla images of twenty-six participants (59±9 years, 46% men). The Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) approach was applied and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation.

Results

Comparison of automated segmentations with corresponding manual segmentation yielded a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of &gt;0.75 for CA1, DG, SUB and ERC; and &gt;0.54 for CA2 and CA3. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were &gt;0.74 for CA1, DG and SUB; and &gt;0.43 for CA2, CA3 and the ERC. Restricting the comparison of the ERC segmentation to a smaller range along the anterior-posterior axis improved both ICCs (left: 0.71; right: 0.82) and DSCs (left: 0.78; right: 0.77). The accuracy of ASHS vs a manual rater was lower, though only slightly for most subfields, than the intra-rater reliability of an expert manual rater, but was similar or slightly higher than the accuracy of an expert vs. a manual rater with ~170h of training for almost all subfields.

Conclusion

This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a computational technique to automatically label hippocampal subfields and the ERC at 7 tesla MRI, with a high accuracy for most subfields that is competitive with the labor intensive manual segmentation. The software and atlas are publicly available: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/ashs/.

1. Introduction

The segmentation of subfields within the hippocampal formation on in vivo MRI is of major interest because these small anatomical subregions are potentially differentially affected in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder and schizophrenia1. In the previous decennium, over 20 segmentation protocols for MRI have been published for the hippocampal subfields and adjacent medial temporal lobe structures2. Most of these protocols rely on manual segmentation 3–9, which is labor intensive, requires a long training period and is often difficult to reproduce between research centers. Automated segmentation methods can help overcome these problems. To our knowledge, currently, only four automated segmentation methods exist10–12, three of which were developed and evaluated on scans acquired at 3 tesla MRI. Only the new FreeSurfer method, developed by Iglesias et al. 13, was developed using a higher resolution 7 tesla post-mortem atlas set, though its application has only been demonstrated at lower field strengths. The advantage of in vivo 7 tesla MRI is that high resolution 3D images can be generated with a relatively short scanning time, making it possible to visualize hippocampal anatomy in greater detail. Recently, an increasing number of 7 tesla studies have been published on the hippocampal subregional morphology14–16. Several manual segmentation protocols exist for 7 tesla MRI5, 7, 17 and a semi-automatic technique for measuring the thickness of hippocampal subfields and layers in the hippocampal body was developed by Kerchner et al.18. In this study we will evaluate the performance of a fully automated segmentation technique for labeling hippocampal subfields and the entorhinal cortex (ERC) at 7 tesla MRI, which comes with a new set of challenges including field inhomogeneity artefacts and increased image size. We do so by adapting a technique previously developed for 3 tesla MRI12 to 7 tesla MRI labeled using the manual annotation protocol developed by Wisse et al. (2012). This protocol and the resulting automatic segmentation cover most of the longitudinal axis of the hippocampal formation. In addition, this paper is the first to show that automatic segmentation performs competitively to inter-rater manual segmentation when the whole length of the hippocampus is labeled. Previously, only Yushkevich et al. carried out a comparison of automatic hippocampal subfield segmentation and inter-rater manual segmentation reliability, doing so at 3 tesla and only in the body of the hippocampus19.

2. Material and methods

2.1 Participants

Participants were included from the PREDICT-MR study16, an ancillary study to the PREDICT-NL study20, aimed to investigate determinants and consequences of brain changes on MRI in general practice attendees. The cohort includes persons aged 18 years or older who were asked to participate while in the waiting room of their general practitioner, irrespective of their complaints.

The studies were carried out in accordance with the principals of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

2.2 Study sample for atlas set, intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability set

For the atlas set, 30 participants with a 7 tesla T2-weighted MRI scan, required for the hippocampal subfield segmentation protocol, were randomly selected from the 47 participants in total. Four were considered to have relatively poor image quality due to excessive subject motion, leaving 26 participants for the current study (mean age: 59±9 years, 46% men, median Mini Mental Status Examination score 21: 29; range: 25–30).

As a comparison for the reliability of the automated segmentation, we included overlap and reliability values of a single rater (LW, rater #1; intra-rater reliability), and of two raters (LW, rater #1 and AH, rater #2; inter-rater reliability). The intra-rater reliability was established in a previous study5 and the dataset consisted of the first fourteen participants of the PREDICT-MR study (overlap with atlas set: n=7)5. For the inter-rater reliability, a random set of fourteen MRI scans of PREDICT-MR was selected for segmentation (overlap with atlas set: n=12). The reliability analysis was after a training period of rater #2 of approximately five months one day a week.

See supplementary material A for a Venn diagram describing the samples.

2.2 Image acquisition

All scans were performed at a 7 tesla MRI scanner (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH, USA) using volume transmit coil and a 16-channel receive coil (Nova Medical Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) (participants included in the study later than May 2011 were scanned with a volume transmit and 32-channel receive head coil (Nova Medical Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA)). The 7 tesla protocol included a 0.70×0.70×0.70 mm3 3D T2-weighted TSE with a TR of 3158 ms, a nominal TE of 301 ms (with a contrast equivalent to a TE of 58 ms for brain tissue in spin-echo sequences with full refocusing angles), a flip angle of 120° (to partly compensate inhomogeneity in the RF field); a TSE factor of 182, a matrix size of 356×357×272, the application of 2D SENSE with acceleration factors of 2.0×2.8 (AP×RL) and a scan duration of 10:15 minutes5. The images were interpolated by zero-filling during reconstruction to a nominal spatial resolution of 0.35×0.35×0.35 mm3. Moreover, the 7 tesla MRI protocol included a 1.00×1.00×1.00 mm3 T1-weighted sequence with a TR of 4.8 ms, TE of 2.2 ms, TI of 1240 ms, a repetition time of the inversion pulses of 3500 ms, a matrix size of 200×250×200 and a scan duration of 1:57 minutes.

2.3 Manual segmentation

Cornu ammonis (CA) fields CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG)1, subiculum (SUB) and ERC were manually segmented, blinded to participant information, using in-house developed software22 based on MeVisLab (MeVis Medical Solutions AG, Bremen, Germany23). Segmentations were performed on coronal images, angulated perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampal formation. The ERC was segmented according to the protocol by Goncharova24, except for the posterior border, for which we followed the protocol of Insausti25. CA1, CA2, CA3, DG and SUB were segmented according to a previously published protocol 5 covering most of the long axis of the hippocampal formation. The anterior border was the most anterior slice on which the hippocampus could be observed. The posterior border was defined as the slice in which the total length of the fornix was visible. This was the most posterior slice on which hippocampal subfields were segmented. Beyond this point subfields fused together and could not be delineated reliably.

2.4 Automated segmentation

We applied the Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields (ASHS) technique using this atlas set. Briefly, the method applies deformable registration of the T1- and T2-weighted images 26, multi-atlas joint label fusion 27 and voxel-wise learning-based error correction 28 to propagate anatomical labels from a set of manually labelled training images to an unlabelled image. ASHS was evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation, i.e., when automatically segmenting the 7 tesla scan of one participant in the study, the scans of the remaining 25 participants were used as training data. The resulting automatic segmentation was then compared to the manual segmentation of the same participant. Certain parameters of the method were modified for the 7 tesla segmentation to account for differences in image size and resolution. More details are provided in Figure 1 and supplementary material B.

2.5 Statistical analyses

Volumes generated by manual and automated segmentations were compared using a paired t-test. The accuracy of automatic segmentation relative to manual segmentation (ASHS vs rater #1) was assessed in terms of relative overlap using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)29. DSC was computed separately for each subfield and jointly for all subfields (generalized DSC30, see supplementary material C for a definition). The consistency of volume measurements derived from automatic and manual segmentations was measured using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The ICC variant that measured absolute agreement under a two-way random analysis of variance model was used. Analogous statistical methods were used to compute ICC and DSC between repeat segmentations of the same scans by rater #1 (intra-rater reliability) and between two raters (rater #1 vs #2; inter-rater reliability).

In the 12 subjects who were included in the atlas set and the sample for the inter-rater reliability of the two manual raters, we performed additional analyses to test whether the DSCs of ASHS vs rater #1 were significantly different from the DSCs of rater #2 vs rater #1, using Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests (two-sided).

In addition, we evaluated the ERC segmentation without the most anterior and posterior slices. We created a mask for the manual segmentation by 1) removing the slices anterior to the head of the hippocampus and 2) by removing the four most anterior and posterior slices of the resulting set of slices.

3. Results

Figure 2 presents a visualization of the comparison of the automated and corresponding manual segmentation from the cross-validation experiment. Based on the generalized DSC, the best, median and worst performances are shown. This figure shows that in the upper and middle panel (the best and median performance) the automated segmentations look very similar to the manual segmentations, though in the middle panel small localized differences can be observed. For example, the segmentation of CA3 (yellow) and the ERC (light brown) is generally smaller/thinner in the automated versus the manual segmentation. In the lower panel, presenting the segmentation with the lowest generalized DSC, the overall location of the subfields is still similar in the manual and automated segmentation. However, local differences can be observed. For example, CA2 (green) and CA3 (yellow) are smaller in the automated versus manual segmentation. In addition, we observed that the mismatch occurs mainly in the segmentation of the most anterior slices for CA2, CA3 and the ERC. The automated segmentation of CA2, CA3 and the ERC included mostly fewer slices, but sometimes more slices than the manual segmentation which was likely a major source of inconsistency between the annotations. We will address this issue later in the results for the ERC and in the discussion. Figure 3 presents a 3D rendering of the automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and the ERC.

Mean volumes of the manual and automated segmentation are shown in table 1. CA1, DG and SUB volumes generated by the automated segmentation were similar to those of manual segmentation, but CA2, CA3 and ERC volumes were smaller compared to the manual segmentation (p&lt;0.05). DSC of ASHS vs rater #1 was &gt;0.75 for the larger subfields CA1, DG, SUB and ERC; however it was lower for the smaller subfields CA2 and CA3 (see table 2). The mean generalized DSC across all subfields in the left hemisphere was 0.80±0.03 and for the right hemisphere 0.79±0.03. The ICC was &gt;0.74 for the larger subfields CA1, DG and SUB, however, it was lower for the ERC and the smaller subfields of CA2 and 3. Combining CA2 and 3 into a single label increases bilateral DSC values and the right ICC compared to the segmentation of CA2 and CA3 alone.

Notably, above results show a discrepancy between the ICC and the DSC values for the ERC. As described above, the automated segmentation of the ERC included mostly fewer slices, but sometimes more slices than the manual segmentation which likely affected the ICC more than the DSC. We recalculated the ICC and DSC in a restricted range, as described in the methods section, and found higher ICC values (left: 0.71, right: 0.82) and slightly higher DSC values (left: 0.78±0.08, right: 0.77±0.06).

Table 2 also shows the intra-rater reliability of manual segmentation by rater #1 5. Overall, the intra-rater reliability was higher than the agreement between the automated and manual segmentation. However, for automatic techniques such as ASHS that are trained on manual segmentations, the intra-rater reliability of manual segmentation represents the theoretical upper bound for the agreement of automatic segmentation with manual segmentation. In addition, table 2 shows the inter-rater reliability and overlap for two manual raters. The DSC values of ASHS vs rater #1 were higher for the larger subfields than the DSCs of rater #1 vs #2, and similar values for the smaller subfields. In additional analyses in the subjects who were included both in the atlas set and the set for the inter-rater reliability for two manual raters, the DSC of ASHS vs rater #1 was significantly higher than the DSC of rater #1 vs #2 for left ERC (p=0.04), left and right SUB (p&lt;0.01; p&lt;0.01), right CA1 (p=0.03) and left and right DG (p=0.02; p&lt;0.01) and at a trend level for right ERC (p=0.08). It was equal for left CA1 (p=0.14), left and right CA2 (p=0.48; p=0.58) and left CA3 (p=0.43). Only for right CA3 was the DSC of the second rater higher at a trend level (p=0.08) than that of ASHS. ASHS also had slightly higher or similar ICC values for the majority of the subfields compared to the second rater, except for DG, CA3 and right CA2.

4. Discussion

The current study demonstrates that automated segmentation of hippocampal subfields and the ERC at 7 tesla MRI is feasible, and that the errors of automatic segmentation are comparable to, and in some cases even lower than, the disagreement between two manual raters applying the same segmentation protocol. ASHS attained high accuracy (ICC &gt;0.74; DSC &gt;0.75) for larger subfields, including CA1, the DG and SUB and lower accuracy for the ERC and smaller subfields, including CA2 and CA3. The anterior and posterior boundaries of the ERC were an important source of disagreement between the manual and automated segmentation. Restricting the range of ERC segmentation increased the accuracy indicating that the ERC segmentation is accurate except at its anterior and posterior segments.

The high accuracy for the larger subfields, which is close to intra-rater reliability of this manual protocol5, is promising and highly relevant given the increasing number of sites using 7 tesla MRI for hippocampal subfield research5, 14, 17, 31. The lower accuracy of the small subfields is consistent, to some extent, with that of the manual rater5. It should be noted that small or thin structures are penalized by the DSC, as also mentioned by Pipitone et al. who show that when comparing the automated segmentation with the manual segmentation shifted by one voxel, the DSCs of smaller structures are affected most 11.

As Table 1 shows, smaller structures (CA2, CA3 and ERC) were under-segmented by ASHS. The tendency of multi-atlas label fusion algorithms to under-segment certain structures is a known limitation 32 and the machine learning corrective learning step in ASHS 28 is meant to mitigate this effect, although it is not theoretically guaranteed to do so. In this study, corrective learning only partially reduced the under-segmentation error for CA2, CA3 and ERC (CA2 left: from 0.050 to 0.054, right: from 0.055 to 0.066; CA3 left: from 0.09 to 0.10, right: from 0.08 to 0.09, ERC left: from 0.46 to 0.47, right: from 0.47 to 0.49). As described in the results section, the mismatch between the automated and manual method occurs mainly in the segmentation of the most anterior and posterior slices for CA2, CA3 and the ERC. This is not surprising, given that the anterior and posterior boundaries of CA2, CA3 and the ERC are based on a heuristic geometrical rule rather than specific boundaries visible in the images. Restricting the range of the ERC indeed greatly increased the accuracy and is much closer to the intra-rater reliability. In addition, the automated method slightly but systematically undersegments CA3 and the ERC in-plane. This undersegmentation might be a point for future improvement, for example, by incorporating a statistical shape prior, by manually retouching the automated segmentation of CA3. The reliability of the CA2 and CA3 segmentation warrants caution for future studies. Investigators might consider excluding these subfields from analyses or grouping them with either CA1 or the DG, dependent on their research interests.

Notably, the automated segmentation performs similar or, in some cases, slightly better than a novice second rater for the majority of the subfields. Training a second rater takes considerable time in general, and specifically for this high resolution data and detailed segmentation protocol, which includes several subfields and extends along most of the long axis of the hippocampus. The segmentation of one hippocampus can take up to 8 hours initially and 2 hours after five months of training. Training on the whole protocol can therefore take several months, underlining the need for an automated segmentation method. ASHS makes it feasible to perform automatic subfield segmentation and morphometry in large datasets, where manual segmentation by a single rater is prohibitive.

In the context of other automated segmentation methods10–12, 33, the current method has a comparable, and even slightly higher accuracy for the segmentation of almost all subfields. Only CA2&amp;3 in the Van Leemput protocol10 had higher accuracy values (DSC is approximately 0.09 higher). However, the segmentation protocol by Van Leemput et al. has received considerable critique34, 35, among others on the placement of the boundaries that resulted in a larger CA2&amp;3 volume in the Van Leemput protocol, compared to our protocol. This probably explains the difference in DSC values. DSC values for the CA1, DG and SUB were 0.03–0.28, 0.02–0.20 and 0.03–0.38 higher than in prior studies10–12, 33, most of which were performed at 3 tesla MRI. For the smaller subfields CA2 and CA3 or the combined CA2&amp;3, DSC values were 0.09–0.10, 0.01–0.05, 0.23–0.25 higher than the DSC values of previous studies that used subfield boundaries comparable to the current study11, 12. Interestingly, the accuracy for segmenting hippocampal subfields in the current 7 tesla study was slightly higher compared to a recent study using the same ASHS technique on anisotropic 3 tesla data12, despite the fact that the intra-rater reliability of the 3 tesla study was higher than for the 7 tesla study. This indicates that there might be added value in using 7 tesla data for the segmentation of hippocampal subfields.

The overlap and ICC values for the whole ERC are lower but approach the values of other automated segmentation methods12, 36, 37. After restricting the range of the ERC segmentation, the accuracy improved and was well within the range of previous studies. This suggests that, despite variability in the anterior and posterior boundary of the ERC, reliable measures of part of the ERC volume can be derived from ASHS segmentation. Another option for future work would be to manually correct the segmentation of the ERC, which would still take less time than a full segmentation.

A limitation of the current study, shared with all other published manual hippocampal subfield segmentation methods, is that in many cases, the actual anatomical boundaries between subfields cannot be inferred on in vivo MRI and are partly based on geometrical rules. Resulting subfields may therefore include parts of neighboring regions. Another limitation is that ASHS is a computationally intensive method, and requires over 24 hours on a single CPU core, to perform the segmentation of one participant. Furthermore, neither the current evaluation of ASHS, nor the previous evaluation in Yushkevich et al. 12, 19 have examined the ability of ASHS atlases to generalize to scans obtained on different MRI scanners and with different MRI parameters. Considering that the MRI scanner and isotropic acquisition used in this study are used by very few research centers, it is unlikely that by directly using our atlas other research groups will attain the same segmentation performance as reported in this paper. However, ASHS is by design an adaptable technique and can be re-trained by other groups using different MRI protocols, provided that a set of manual segmentation is available. Moreover, in previous work, we have used atlases constructed using MRI scans with one protocol to label MTL subregions in scans obtained with a different protocol and even field strength. For instance, we used an atlas developed on 4 tesla MRI to investigate hippocampal subfields on 3 tesla MRI, and demonstrated stronger discrimination of CA1 compared to total hippocampal volume between prodromal AD and controls 38, but also showed that manual correction of ASHS results further improved discrimination of the CA1. Similarly, ASHS trained on data from a single 3 tesla scanner was applied to multi-site data from ADNI2 in 39, with sensible results. Although we have not validated the current 7 tesla ASHS approach on other datasets, we have applied it on a few 0.4×0.4×1.0 mm3 7 tesla scans obtained on a Siemens scanner with visually satisfactory segmentation results (see supplementary figure 1 for an example). In future work, it will be important to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of ASHS in cross-scanner applications, as well as to measure how differences in presence and severity of neurodegenerative disease in the atlas set and the target images affect segmentation accuracy. The fact that the current evaluation was carried out in patients without known neurodegenerative disease is a limitation, although, in Yushkevich et al. (2015) 12, ASHS accuracy did not differ significantly between MCI patients and controls. Finally, the datasets to evaluate the accuracy of ASHS vs rater #1 and the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the manual raters only partially overlapped, which may have introduced a bias, though it should be noted that they were all drawn without any consideration of image or segmentation quality from the same study population and the scan quality in the resulting datasets was comparable between subjects. When comparing the DSCs of ASHS vs rater #1 with the DSCs for the intra-rater relaibility, and the DSCs of ASHS vs rater #1 vs those of rater #1 vs #2 in the smaller, overlapping datasets, we saw no notable difference the results (see supplementary material D). This indicates that the reliability of the segmentation was similar in all subjects and that the selection of scans probably did not introduce a bias.

5. Conclusion

We present a fully automated segmentation method of hippocampal subfields at 7 tesla MRI with high accuracy for most of the subfields. The accuracy of this method is competitive with other published automated methods and with the inter-rater reliability for manual segmentation. Both the software and the atlas are publicly available at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/ashs/.
