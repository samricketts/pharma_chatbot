The cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (GMP-AMP) synthase-Stimulator of Interferon Genes (cGAS-STING) pathway is a critical innate immune mechanism for detecting the presence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and prompting a robust immune response. Canonical cGAS-STING activation occurs when cGAS, a predominantly cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, binds microbial DNA to promote STING activation. Upon STING activation, transcription factors enter the nucleus to cause the production of Type I interferons, inflammatory cytokines whose primary function is to prime the host for viral infection by producing a number of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. While the pathway was originally described in viral infection, more recent studies have implicated cGAS-STING signaling in a number of different contexts, including autoimmune disease, cancer, injury, and neuroinflammatory disease. This review focuses on how our understanding of the cGAS-STING pathway has evolved over time with an emphasis on the role of STING-mediated neuroinflammation and infection in the nervous system. We discuss recent findings on how STING signaling contributes to the pathology of pain, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, as well as how mitochondrial DNA may promote STING activation in common neurodegenerative diseases. We conclude by commenting on the current knowledge gaps that should be filled before STING can be an effective therapeutic target in neuroinflammatory disease.

pmc1 | DISCOVERY OF STING

Interferons (IFNs) were first described in the 1950s as factors released during infection to interfere with viral growth (Issacs &amp; Lindenmann, 1988; Vilcek, 2006). While three subsets of interferons exist (Type I, II, and III), Type I IFNs (primarily IFNα and IFNβ) are of particular interest because nearly all nucleated cells are able to produce and respond to Type I IFNs (McNab et al., 2015). In contrast, Type II IFNs (IFNγ) are produced predominantly by natural killer (NK) cells during infection (Lee &amp; Ashkar, 2018), whereas Type III IFNs (IFNλ) are produced only at the mucosal surfaces (J. H. Zhou et al., 2018), limiting their applicability to other body systems such as the peripheral or central nervous systems. While IFNs were originally described for their role in infection, it is now known that IFNs are produced in response to a number of different stimuli and cause pleiotropic effects.

STING was first identified by several different groups (Ishikawa &amp; Barber, 2008; Sun et al., 2009; Zhong et al., 2008) as a key mediator of the Type I IFN response with possible roles in mediating apoptosis (Jin et al., 2008). Initial reports suggested that STING functions downstream of the cytosolic RNA sensor RIG-I and showed that knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) of STING resulted in a blunted IFNβ response to single strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses (Ishikawa &amp; Barber, 2008; Zhong et al., 2008). Overexpression experiments showed increased viral resistance and increased production of IFNβ, as well as dimerization and translocation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), indicating its activation (Ishikawa &amp; Barber, 2008; Zhong et al., 2008). Tank Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) was shown to be necessary for STING activation (Ishikawa &amp; Barber, 2008), likely due to STING phosphorylation by TBK1 (Zhong et al., 2008). Interestingly, using similar methods the groups reported different cellular localizations and mechanisms of action: (Zhong et al., 2008) reported that STING was located in the mitochondria, a finding that was also noted by (Jin et al., 2008), and did not see a change in NF-κB in overexpression models. In contrast, (Ishikawa &amp; Barber, 2008) showed that STING is located in the ER, which was also shown by (W. Sun et al., 2009), and is able to induce NF-κB expression when overexpressed. Critically, both groups noted that STING plays a role in the Type I IFN response to dsDNA (Ishikawa &amp; Barber, 2008; Zhong et al., 2008), though the mechanism of this response remained unclear at the time. This was further confirmed in a subsequent study which verified that loss of STING in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) abolished the IFNβ response to viral DNA or synthetic dsDNA and showed that STING KO mice displayed an extreme susceptibility to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection (Ishikawa et al., 2009). These findings prompted further studies to identify an upstream cytosolic DNA sensor that would mediate STING activity (Burdette &amp; Vance, 2013).

Following the discovery that STING was able to bind cyclic dinucleotides (Burdette et al., 2011), it was confirmed that cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (GMP-AMP; cGAMP) strongly binds STING to promote its activation and downstream signaling (Wu et al., 2013). The same group identified cGAMP synthase (cGAS), a previously uncharacterized nucleotidyltransferase, as the protein responsible for binding DNA and synthesizing cGAMP in vitro (Sun et al., 2013). By generating a cGAS KO mouse, they also demonstrated that cGAS and STING were both critical in host defense against HSV-1 in vivo, though they did note that some cell types may have compensatory mechanisms for detecting viral DNA (X. D. Li, Wu, et al., 2013).

The discovery of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING signaling pathway led to a flurry of studies to elucidate the structure of these molecules and clarify the specific mechanism of activation. cGAS binds the sugar-phosphate backbone of viral dsDNA, resulting in conformational changes that catalyze the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP (Ablasser et al., 2013; Civril et al., 2013; X. Li, Shu, et al., 2013; X. Zhang, Wu, et al., 2014). Upon its production, cGAMP binds the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ER-resident STING dimer with high affinity (X. Zhang et al., 2013). This binding causes a 180 rotation in the LBD that forms a β-sheet “lid” over the ligand binding pocket and enables STING oligomerization and translocation to the Golgi (P. Gao, Ascano, et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2019). At the Golgi, TBK1 is recruited and activated by STING, resulting in STING phosphorylation which facilitates recruitment and phosphorylation of IRF3 (Dobbs et al., 2015; Mukai et al., 2016; Tanaka &amp; Chen, 2012; C. Zhang et al., 2019), a transcription factor long-known to be crucial for the Type I IFN response (Stetson &amp; Medzhitov, 2006). Phosphorylated IRF3 dimers trans-locate to the nucleus where they prompt transcription of Type I IFNs (Sato et al., 2000). While alternative mechanisms of activation have been proposed (Dunphy et al., 2018; Unterholzner &amp; Dunphy, 2019), the above is the presently accepted canonical STING signaling mechanism (Figure 1).

2 | STING IN PERIPHERAL VIRAL AND BACTERIAL INFECTION

STING was first described as a mediator of the response to cytosolic RNA, specifically through its interaction with RIG-I. However, it was quickly determined that STING plays a critical role in response to intracellular DNA viruses, though evidence also indicates that cGAS is able to detect retroviruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (D. Gao, Wu, et al., 2013). Early work in MEFs demonstrated a STING-dependent IFNβ response to DNA from adenoviruses HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Ishikawa et al., 2009). cGAS-STING signaling has also been shown to be activated in response to adenoviruses in human cell lines (Lam et al., 2014; Lam &amp; Falck-Pedersen, 2014). The role of cGAS-STING in detecting and inhibiting hepatitis B virus (HBV) has also been well-studied. STING activation by cGAMP or DMXAA, a STING agonist, (Prantner et al., 2012) suppresses HBV replication and increases IFNβ production both in vitro and in vivo (F. Guo et al., 2015; He et al., 2016). There is also evidence that the viral polymerase, Pol, is able to interact with and prevent STING activation by disrupting its ubiquitination (Y. Liu et al., 2015). STING ubiquitination facilitates its dimerization, which is necessary for TBK1 recruitment (Tsuchida et al., 2010); therefore, this disruption allows HBV to counteract the host’s STING-mediated immune response. Furthermore, by packaging its genome and producing non-immune stimulatory RNAs, HBV is able to evade detection by cGAS in hepatocytes (Lauterbach-Rivière et al., 2020; Verrier et al., 2018). Based on these findings, cGAS-STING signaling is a potential therapeutic target for treating chronic HBV infection (Alexopoulou et al., 2020).

cGAS has been shown to bind a variety of different nucleic acids independent of sequence (Civril et al., 2013; L. Sun et al., 2013), so unsurprisingly cGAS-STING signaling has been shown to also play a role in the response to a number of bacteria (reviewed extensively in Guimarães et al., 2021; N. Liu et al., 2022; Marinho et al., 2017). Interestingly, the production of IFNβ is detrimental to the clearance of many of these bacterial infections, including Brucella abortus (de Almeida et al., 2011) and Listeria monocytogenes (Archer et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2013; Sauer et al., 2011), suggesting the effects of STING signaling are highly context-dependent.

cGAS also has the ability to bind and respond to self-DNA. Given the prokaryotic origin of mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has many features in common with bacteria, such as a circular genome and unmethylated CpG motifs (Anderson et al., 1981). Considering these similarities, it is not surprising that cGAS responds to mtDNA to activate STING signaling (Andreeva et al., 2017; West et al., 2015). Apoptotic stimuli and cellular stress allow for outer mitochondrial membrane permeability releasing mtDNA into the cytosol (Cosentino et al., 2022; McArthur et al., 2018; Riley et al., 2018).

Nuclear DNA has also been shown to trigger cGAS-STING signaling. Mutations that affect the loss of RNAse H2 activity, an endonuclease protein that degrades RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids, causes the activation of the STING-ISG pathway (Mackenzie et al., 2016) due to the genomic instability and formation of micronuclei (Mackenzie et al., 2017). Nuclear DNA damage causes these micronuclei to form as the cell progresses through mitosis, and some of the chromosomal material is not incorporated into the daughter cell, thus causing cGAS activation and its localization to micronuclei (Harding et al., 2017; Mackenzie et al., 2017). Double strand break (DSBs) damage caused by etoposide has also been shown to activate STING, but whether it is always cGAS mediated is unclear (Dunphy et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017). Nevertheless, self-DNA in the cytosol can trigger cGAS-STING signaling and the downstream IFN response (D. Gao et al., 2015).

Where cGAS was originally thought to be predominantly cytosolic (de Oliveira Mann &amp; Hopfner, 2021; Sun et al., 2013), additional studies have challenged this view. The first report of its nuclear localization found cGAS in human fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Orzalli et al., 2015). Recent data suggest cytosolic cGAS function depends on a nuclear export signal (H. Sun et al., 2021), and nuclear DNA damaging agents cause GFP-cGAS positive foci to colocalize with dsDNA outside of the nucleus (Yang et al., 2017). However, endogenous inactive cGAS appears nuclear, reliant on intact chromatin (H. Jiang et al., 2019; Volkman et al., 2019). Cryo-EM structural determinants find cGAS complexes with nucleosome components to keep it inactive (Boyer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Kujirai et al., 2020; Michalski et al., 2020; Pathare et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Nuclear versus cytosolic cGAS pools may differ between cell types (H. Jiang et al., 2019; Volkman et al., 2019), so future investigation into cGAS localization in the central nervous system is warranted.

3 | STING IN THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

Nociceptive pain is sensed through peripheral neuroimmune mechanisms. Given that many painful stimuli are associated with immune activation, such as in the context of infection, it is unsurprising that this connection between immune cells and pain-detecting neurons exists. Peripheral sensory neurons (termed nociceptors) detect noxious stimuli, causing action potentials that are relayed to the brain via the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Basbaum et al., 2009). These neurons are able to detect stimuli from a variety of sources, such as heat, mechanical damage, or by binding cytokines and other factors produced by immune cells (Baral et al., 2019). Furthermore, nociceptors also express their own pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that allow them to directly detect pathogen- and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs, respectively) and activate immune cells (reviewed extensively in Donnelly et al., 2020).

STING was identified as a regulator of nociception (Donnelly et al., 2021). In an elegant and thorough study utilizing rodents and nonhuman primates, Donnelly and colleagues show that STING in sensory neurons plays a substantial role in nociception. Mice lacking STING had increased pain sensitivity when compared to WT animals, and intrathecal treatment with STING agonists produced a dose-dependent reduction in this hypersensitivity. These effects were entirely abolished in animals with IFNAR conditionally knocked out in sensory neurons, confirming that the anti-nociceptive effects of STING activation is mediated by neurons (Donnelly et al., 2021). Of translational relevance, treatment with the STING agonist ADU-S100 produced increased cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of IFNβ and decreased action potential firing of nociceptors in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of nonhuman primates, suggesting that targeting STING may be promising for treating pain in humans (Donnelly et al., 2021). In a separate study, the same group also showed that systemic treatment with STING agonists reduced bone cancer pain and improved locomotor function in mice (K. Wang, Donnelly, et al., 2021). Together, these studies highlight a novel role for neuronal STING in peripheral nociception.

4 | STING IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTION

One of the first reports that examined the potential role of STING activity in the central nervous system (CNS) described its interaction with RIG-I when neuroblastoma cells were infected with the ssRNA flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus (Nazmi et al., 2012). Subsequent studies have also implicated STING in restricting CNS spread of other flaviviruses, including the West Nile virus (Wuertz et al., 2019) and Zika virus (Q. Ding et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). Type I IFN signaling in neurons has been shown to be particularly important. Primary neurons lacking the Type I IFN receptor, IFNAR, are more susceptible to rabies virus infection (Chopy et al., 2011), and IFNβ treatment of WT primary neurons reduces replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (Trottier et al., 2005).

Other work has confirmed a critical role for cGAS-STING signaling in DNA viruses within the CNS; where herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has been the most well-studied. It is estimated that 67% of the global population harbors HSV-1 virions, yet no cure exists (James et al., 2020; Looker et al., 2015). While initial symptoms are generally mild, HSV-1 is neurotropic and remains dormant in neuronal tissue until an immune stressor stimulates proliferation (Suzich &amp; Cliffe, 2018). Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) can be life-threatening, and there is increasing evidence that brain-resident HSV-1 contributes to neurodegenerative disease in patients both with and without clinical symptoms of the infection (Duarte et al., 2019).

While it was established early on that STING is critical for host response to HSV-1 (Ishikawa et al., 2009), it was later shown that STING’s protective role is at least in part based on whether virus was introduced directly to the brain or peripherally. STING KO animals were highly susceptible to central (intravenous or intracerebral) HSV-1 challenge, whereas animals deficient in STING had similar survival as WT animals when challenged peripherally (via the cornea; Parker et al., 2015), suggesting that CNS, rather than peripheral STING may be particularly beneficial for combatting HSV-1. Other work demonstrated that STING KO mice had increased CNS spread of HSV-1 and showed that microglia are the primary brain cell type responsible for the STING-dependent Type I IFN response to HSV-1 infection (Katzilieris-Petras et al., 2022; Reinert et al., 2016). In contrast, others have shown that neuronal IFN signaling is critical for restricting HSV-1 production in the brain (Rosato &amp; Leib, 2015), and IFNβ treatment of primary neuronal cultures increases cell survival (Low-Calle et al., 2014). It is possible that microglia are responsible for STING activation and produce IFNs that bind neuronal IFNAR to restrict viral replication. Of note, it has been shown that the outcome of cGAS-STING signaling in HSV-1 infection is dose-dependent: when mice or BV2 microglia-like cells are infected with low doses of HSV-1, a robust Type I IFN response occurs. In contrast, when the HSV-1 dose was tripled, immune cells underwent apoptosis (Reinert et al., 2021). This suggests the immune cells have evolved innate mechanisms for blunting the Type I IFN response to prevent excessive tissue damage, a particularly critical mechanism in the brain where substantial regeneration does not occur.

While the host immune system has established ways to maintain a delicate balance of viral-clearing Type I IFN production and tissue homeostasis, HSV-1 has developed its own mechanisms to evade detection (reviewed extensively in Verzosa et al., 2021). HSV-1 proteins prevent IFN signaling across the entire cGAS-STING pathway by degrading cGAS mRNA (Su &amp; Zheng, 2017), preventing cGAMP production (Huang et al., 2018), and inhibiting TBK1 dimerization (You et al., 2019). A number of other proteins have been proposed to be involved in the STING-mediated response to HSV-1, including RIG-I (Liu et al., 2016), ZDHHC1 (Q. Zhou et al., 2014), and NLRP3 (W. Wang et al., 2020), offering additional proteins for HSV-1 to target to limit the immune response. Some HSV-1 proteins have been shown to interact with STING to promote its deubiquitination (Bodda et al., 2020), thus preventing STING dimerization, or by binding STING to counteract its activation (Deschamps &amp; Kalamvoki, 2017), though the mechanisms of these interactions are not entirely clear. Interestingly, HSV-1 has also been shown to stabilize STING protein in a cell-type-specific manner and export STING and viral mRNA to nearby cells via exosomes (Kalamvoki et al., 2014; Kalamvoki &amp; Roizman, 2014). Taken together, these data suggest a highly complex interplay between various immune modulators and CNS viruses that we are only just beginning to understand. Additional studies with other viruses will increase our understanding of anti-viral STING signaling in the CNS.

5 | STING IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

5.1 | Expression of STING in the CNS

There is currently conflicting evidence about which cell types in the brain express STING. As an immune protein, it is logical to assume that microglia have robust STING expression. In fact, many studies have shown that microglia are the primary CNS cell type expressing STING (R. Ding et al., 2022; Fritsch et al., 2022; Katzilieris-Petras et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2020; Reinert et al., 2016). An RNA-sequencing study in a brain injury model showed that while astrocytes mount a Type I IFN response following trauma, the microglial response is significantly larger (Todd et al., 2021). RNA sequencing databases also indicate that STING expression is predominantly found in microglia (Y. Zhang, Chen, et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2016). However, others have suggested that neurons and astrocytes also express STING in high levels (Abdullah et al., 2018; Donnelly et al., 2021; Gamdzyk et al., 2020; Jeffries &amp; Marriott, 2017). One key problem is that many of these studies rely upon immunofluorescence, which may produce a nonspecific signal. Even upon validation of antibody reagents in STING KO tissue, studies using the same antibodies have shown different staining patterns across cell types (Chu et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2020), highlighting the need for more specific antibodies. Knowledge of the neuronal or glial subtype(s) that STING expression may be restricted to is relatively unexplored. Nevertheless, loss of STING either in neurons or glial cells both increases ZIKA viral particle replication in Drosophila, indicating it functions across many cell types in the brain (Liu et al., 2018).

5.2 | Stroke/ischemia

Stroke is the second most common cause of death globally (Johnson et al., 2019) and occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted due to blood clots or hemorrhage. The alteration of blood flow results in regions of ischemia and neuronal excitotoxicity, causing rapid cell death as well as longer-term neuroinflammatory events. Within hours of the event, resident microglia and astrocytes are activated, leading to the production of various cytokines and chemokines that recruit peripheral immune cells and compromise the integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB). Phagocytic immune cells attempt to clear cell debris and produce additional cytokines to promote a highly inflammatory environment (Jayaraj et al., 2019).

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are chromatin-based structures released by neutrophils that trap pathogens and promote pro-inflammatory cytokine production. NETs have been shown to activate cGAS (Apel et al., 2021) and impact vascular remodeling following stroke (Kang et al., 2020). In a murine middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, cGAS was shown to be upregulated after injury, but this elevation was somewhat reduced when NETs were degraded with DNase, suggesting cGAS may be activated by binding NETs after stroke (R. Wang, Zhu, et al., 2021). Loss of cGAS also reduced hemorrhage and motor deficits after MCAO, whereas activation of STING with cGAMP administration worsened outcome (R. Wang, Zhu, et al., 2021). Similarly, pharmaceutical inhibition of cGAS with RU.512 in a rat model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia reduced infarct size (Gamdzyk et al., 2020), and neuronal apoptosis and cognitive deficits were reduced when STING was inhibited with C-176 in a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) model (Peng et al., 2020). While microglia shifted towards an inflammatory M1-phenotype after MCAO, administration of C-176 resulted in reduced M1 microglia and increased anti-inflammatory M2 microglia (Kong et al., 2022), suggesting that the brain’s inflammatory state is altered by the loss of STING signaling. Of note, mice lacking cGAS specifically in microglia showed a significant reduction in lesion size after MCAO (Q. Li et al., 2020), suggesting that microglia are an important cell type for cGAS-STING signaling after stroke.

cGAS-STING signaling also appears to influence the cell populations that infiltrate the brain parenchyma after stroke. In cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a less common form of stroke that results from impaired venous drainage, mice showed a significant reduction in the infiltration of neutrophils when cGAS was inhibited with RU.521 (R. Ding et al., 2022). Despite having a significant decrease in monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), the number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages was not significantly altered by the inhibition of cGAS (R. Ding et al., 2022). Regardless, inhibition of cGAS-STING signaling may alter the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, influencing more chronic aspects of neuroinflammation. Interestingly, pretreatment with the STING agonist, DMXAA, reduced infarct size in a murine MCAO model, leading the authors to conclude that activation of STING may be useful as a prophylactic treatment (Kundu et al., 2022). Consistently, administration of IFNβ before a rabbit model of ischemic stroke reduces infarct size (H. Liu et al., 2002). Together, these data strongly support a role for cGAS-STING signaling in both ischemic and hemorrhagic brain events, but show that the effect of Type I IFNs in stroke may be temporally dependent.

cGAS-STING signaling can be activated by cytosolic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA; Rongvaux et al., 2014; West et al., 2015; White et al., 2014) and nuclear DNA (Volkman et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2017); therefore, several groups have sought to determine if self-DNA may be responsible for triggering cGAS-STING activation in stroke. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) has been found in the cytosol after MCAO models (Kong et al., 2022; Q. Li et al., 2020) and CVST (R. Ding et al., 2022). These studies suggest that the aberrant accumulation of self-DNA following stroke may prompt activation of cGAS-STING-mediated inflammation to facilitate the clearance of damaged tissue. Taken together, there is substantial evidence for a role of cGAS-STING signaling in stroke and related ischemic CNS events. While some evidence suggests that there may be a benefit to prophylactically activating STING in these contexts (Kundu et al., 2022), the majority of the studies have found that impairing cGAS-STING signaling by genetic or pharmaceutical measures improves outcome in rodent models of stroke (Table 1).

5.3 | Traumatic brain injury

Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a leading cause of death and disability across the globe, affecting 69 million people annually (Dewan et al., 2018). TBI occurs in two phases: primary mechanical injury that causes immediate damage to the brain, and secondary injury that occurs over the minutes to weeks after injury resulting in exacerbated tissue damage. As a key aspect of secondary injury, neuroinflammation is currently one of the most promising targets for therapeutic intervention (Jassam et al., 2017; McKee &amp; Lukens, 2016). The neuroinflammatory events that occur after TBI are remarkably similar to those discussed above.

There is substantial evidence that interferons are produced and play a mechanistic importance in TBI and spinal cord injury (SCI) (Roselli et al., 2018). While most studies on human patient samples have focused on Type II IFNs (reviewed in Roselli et al., 2018), some evidence does suggest that IFNβ and IFNγ is detected and upregulated several hours after TBI (Frugier et al., 2010; Helmy et al., 2011; Karve et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2014). In addition, numerous studies have shown an upregulation of Type I IFNs in rodent models of TBI (Barrett et al., 2020; Fritsch et al., 2022; Karve et al., 2016).

Karve et al. showed that male IFNAR KO mice have significantly reduced lesion size acutely after a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of moderate TBI (Karve et al., 2016). These animals also showed reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production, as well as increased microglial expression of CD206, a marker for the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. In line with this, another group showed that treatment of primary microglia with IFNβ caused a shift toward the inflammatory M1 phenotype (Sen et al., 2020). However, in Karve’s study, IFNAR KO mice also showed increased Iba1 and GFAP expression, which could be indicative of microgliosis and astrogliosis, respectively (Eng &amp; Ghirnikar, 1994; Ito et al., 2007). Despite this, mice that were treated with MAR1, an antibody that blocks IFNAR, had smaller lesion sizes up to 1-week post-TBI, as well as reduced motor deficits (Karve et al., 2016), suggesting that inhibiting Type I IFN signaling is broadly protective. Of note, data from bone marrow chimeras utilized in this study also suggest that hematopoietic IFNAR is also responsible for driving detrimental IFN signaling in TBI (Karve et al., 2016). In contrast to the benefits of INFAR KO, another group using female IFNAR KO mice showed that these mice had increased macrophage infiltration after axonal injury, which they attributed to increased matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) in IFNAR KO animals (Khorooshi &amp; Owens, 2010). MMP9 facilitates leukocyte recruitment by degrading extracellular matrix (Cabral-Pacheco et al., 2020), and has previously been shown to be negatively regulated by Type I IFNs (Stuve et al., 1997); therefore, it is possible that uninhibited MMP9 results in increased BBB permeability, allowing increased immune cell infiltration.

In a moderate CCI injury, IFNβ KO animals had reduced motor impairments and cognitive deficits up to 1 month after injury, as well as blunted pro-inflammatory cytokine production 3 days after injury (Barrett et al., 2020). In confirmation of the study by Karve et al., this study also utilized an anti-IFNAR antibody (Barrett et al., 2020). Motor skills were improved up to 2 weeks after injury when mice received the antibody, but no difference was seen after 3 months (Barrett et al., 2020). Of note, mRNA for STING and other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), but not cGAS, remained upregulated 60 days after injury (Barrett et al., 2020), suggesting that STING-mediated neuroinflammation plays a chronic role in TBI. This same group later showed that when compared to young animals, aged animals showed elevated cGAS and IFN expression after TBI (Barrett et al., 2021).

The majority of the studies assessing IFNAR and IFNβ in TBI show that loss or inhibition of Type I IFN signaling is beneficial; however, other mechanisms for producing Type I IFNs exist. Two studies have specifically addressed the effects of loss of cGAS or STING in TBI (Abdullah et al., 2018; Fritsch et al., 2022). STING mRNA is elevated in postmortem human TBI patients, which was also seen in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model (Abdullah et al., 2018). STING KO mice showed a significant reduction in lesion size and pro-inflammatory cytokines 1 day after injury (Abdullah et al., 2018). In contrast to earlier work showing that IFNAR KO mice had increased GFAP and Iba1 reactivity (Karve et al., 2016), STING KO animals had reduced GFAP and Iba1 immunofluorescence (Abdullah et al., 2018). Using the same model, our group showed that cGAS KO and STING KO mice both showed reduced lesion size, cell death, and cytokine production 1 day after injury (Fritsch et al., 2022). Of note, levels of chemokines including MCP1 and CXCL10 were reduced in KO animals compared to WT, suggesting peripheral immune cell infiltration could possibly be reduced (Fritsch et al., 2022). cGAS KO mice showed decreased motor deficits, and both cGAS KO and STING KO mice had reduced lesion sizes 2 weeks after injury. Importantly, we also demonstrated that the immune modulator NLRX1 appears to negatively regulate STING phosphorylation after brain trauma (Fritsch et al., 2022), a finding that previously had only been demonstrated in vitro (H. Guo et al., 2016) and provides an additional potential target for therapeutics. Furthermore, mtDNA is present in the cytosol of injured cells acutely after TBI (Fritsch et al., 2022), indicating that cGAS may be activated by the release of mtDNA in brain trauma. Given that STING may be activated through cGAS-independent mechanisms (Dunphy et al., 2018; Unterholzner &amp; Dunphy, 2019), these findings suggest that STING signaling in brain injury at least in part depends upon cGAS. cGAS STING double knockout mice would be needed to elucidate whether any cGAS-independent signaling of STING occurs during brain injury.

Taken together, these studies show that STING-IFN signaling is an important aspect of neuroinflammation after brain injury. Based on the current literature, a working model of STING-IFN signaling in stroke and brain injury is proposed (Figure 2). The majority of this work demonstrates a detrimental role for the Type I IFN response in TBI (Table 2).

6 | STING SIGNALING IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE: CONNECTION TO MITOCHONDRIAL DNA?

Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, brain trauma is a known risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative disease (Graham &amp; Sharp, 2019; Smith et al., 2013). Increasingly, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is being recognized as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) in traumatic brain injury (Fritsch et al., 2022; Kilbaugh et al., 2015; Walko et al., 2014). Mitochondrial damage and dysfunction are also hallmarks of aging (Jang et al., 2018; Lin &amp; Beal, 2006), and mtDNA levels circulating in the serum have been shown to increase with age, as well as correlate with systemic inflammation (Pinti et al., 2014). Furthermore, mitochondrial mutations and alterations in mtDNA are associated with a number of different neurodegenerative diseases (Bender et al., 2006; Coskun et al., 2004; Keogh &amp; Chinnery, 2015; Lin et al., 2002; Wiedemann et al., 2002). cGAS, STING, and Type I IFN signaling have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative and aging-related disorders. Several recent reviews have covered these relationships (Decout et al., 2021; Fryer et al., 2021; Paul et al., 2021); therefore, this review will focus on observations where mtDNA was implicated in STING-IFN signaling and where preclinical mouse models of neurodegenerative disease were used to manipulate cGAS-STING signaling either directly or indirectly in these studies (Table 3).

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare, progressive, autosomal dominant genetic disease that results from CAG repeats in the huntingtin (HTT) gene causing polyglutamine expansions with the number of expansions dictating disease onset (Walker, 2007). Chorea is the primary symptom for diagnosis, and the basal ganglia is the primary brain region affected (Waldvogel et al., 2015). As the disease progresses, other brain regions such as the cerebral cortex are affected, and symptoms expand to include more advanced cognitive and behavioral changes (Bates et al., 2015; Waldvogel et al., 2015). Unfortunately, most HD patients die within 15–20 years of symptom onset (Bates et al., 2015). Mitochondrial dysfunction is prevalent in HD (Y. Wang, Guo, et al., 2021), and a study in a small cohort of patients showed that mtDNA copy number is elevated in leukocytes compared to healthy controls, particularly for female patients (Jędrak et al., 2017). Recently, two groups have shown that cGAS and STING are upregulated in the brains of HD patients (Jauhari et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020). One study also showed that HD mutant cell lines had increased cytosolic mtDNA, leading the authors to conclude that cGAS-STING signaling may be activated by the release of mtDNA (Jauhari et al., 2020). Micronuclei fragments have also been found in knock-in HD-derived striatal cells and HD human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) derived striatal neurons suggest nuclear DNA may also trigger this pathway with depletion of cGAS reducing inflammation and autophagy (Sharma et al., 2020).

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting millions of patients each year (Scheltens et al., 2016). While the cause of AD is unknown, neuroinflammation, including IFN signaling (Gorlé &amp; Vandenbroucke, 2019), is believed to play a role in the pathophysiological changes that occur in AD. While memory deficits are the most common symptom of AD, the disease is characterized by widespread distribution of intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles and intracellular and extracellular amyloid beta plaques (Deture &amp; Dickson, 2019; Scheltens et al., 2016). Mitochondrial dysfunction often precedes aggregate formation and degeneration in AD (Chagnon et al., 1995; Mutisya et al., 1994; Yao et al., 2009). Next-generation sequencing of hippocampal neurons showed a significant increase in mtDNA mutations in patients with early-stage AD (Hoekstra et al., 2016). Fibroblasts from AD patients showed that mtDNA was released into the cytosol, and increased cortical expression of cGAS and STING was noted in a transgenic mouse model of AD from 7 months on (Hou et al., 2021). However, osmotic pump delivery of cGAMP to stimulate cGAS using the same transgenic mouse model of AD at 5 months of age showed benefits to behavioral outcome measures and neuropathology (Xu et al., 2019). cGAMP and other STING agonists have been found to cross the plasma membrane using the SLC19A1 importer (Ritchie et al., 2019), but its half-life is short due to its hydro-lysis extracellularly (L. Li et al., 2014). It is unclear from these studies which cell types display beneficial or negative effects from STING activation. These discrepancies also highlight a similar need to better temporally profile inflammatory events in preclinical models, but also the need to ensure that these changes reflect what is occurring in patients, which is undoubtedly more difficult until the disease end stage.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder that affects upper and lower motor neurons (van Es et al., 2017). Degeneration of these neurons in the brain and spinal cord results in muscle atrophy, with a median survival of 3–5 years from diagnosis (Grad et al., 2017). Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is an aggregated protein that has undergone many types of post-translational modifications found in postmortem ALS brains (Arai et al., 2006; Mackenzie &amp; Rademakers, 2008; Neumann et al., 2006). TDP-43 induces mtDNA release into the cytosol by opening the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Yu et al., 2020). This cytosolic mtDNA prompts inflammation in a STING-dependent manner, which was verified by both genetic KO mouse models and pharmaceutical STING inhibition (Yu et al., 2020). Of note, cGAMP is also elevated in the spinal cords of ALS patients and in a mouse model of ALS (Yu et al., 2020). Additional studies will be needed to confirm the role of cGAS-STING signaling in ALS.

7 | FUTURE DIRECTIONS

STING signaling has been implicated in dozens of protective and pathological functions across nearly every organ system. In particular, the role of STING in disease and injury conditions has become a growing area of interest, highlighting not just the importance of the STING-IFN response, but also the paucity of treatments for countless diseases. Current evidence suggests targeting STING signaling either via agonism or inhibition may be beneficial for a number of diseases. In fact, several clinical trials have sought to address whether STING agonism is beneficial in cancer (M. Jiang et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the results available so far are disappointing, with STING agonists showing little anti-tumor effect in human patients, despite promising preclinical results (Gogoi et al., 2020). While any number of factors can cause failures in clinical trials, this may in part be due to the newly discovered pro-cancer functions of STING (discussed in M. Jiang et al., 2020), underscoring how much remains to be understood in STING signaling. Several important questions must be addressed before considering STING-based therapeutics in neuroinflammatory disease.

The time course of STING activation and subsequent window for therapeutics must be thoroughly characterized for each disease or injury paradigm. For most neurological disorders, the aim is to limit inflammatory events that are harmful. However, it is likely that there are critical timepoints in which STING activation may be beneficial. Moreover, clarifying whether targeting cGAS, STING, IFNs, or another protein involved in this response, such as NLRX1, may be of therapeutic benefit will require better understanding of the timing of activation. For example, in mouse models of TBI, STING and many ISGs remain upregulated 2 months post-injury while cGAS is unaltered from sham levels (Barrett et al., 2020). However, some select ISGs and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFNA4, IFNB1, and IL-6, were found to be downregulated 2 weeks after injury (Fritsch et al., 2022), indicating that chronic timepoints across injury models need better assessment. At an acute timepoint after TBI, cGAS expression was particularly elevated in aged animals compared to young animals (Barrett et al., 2021), indicating that the magnitude and/or timing of cGAS-STING-IFN signaling may also be age-dependent. Though it is clear that STING signaling occurs after TBI and other neuroinflammatory events, the temporal dynamics of this response remain unclear.

There is not yet a consensus on which cell types in the brain express STING. As discussed previously, even when using the same reagents, studies by separate groups have concluded different cell types express STING. Additionally, STING and cGAS themselves have been described as ISGs (Ma, Li, Liu, et al., 2015), therefore, it is possible that any cell with even low basal expression has the ability to upregulate this pathway in disease contexts. To complicate matters further, stroke and injury paradigms have a flux of infiltrating immune cells and quickly change tissue heterogeneity in response to the damage. More refined techniques such as single-cell sequencing may be required to parse out STING expression at baseline and during disease states. Furthermore, much of this work done in animal models must be confirmed in humans as it remains possible that expression patterns differ between species. As we move toward targeted therapeutics, clarifying which cell types pharmaceutical interventions must reach is critical.

This review focused on how mtDNA has been implicated in triggering cGAS-STING signaling in the context of neurodegenerative disease. However, nuclear DNA damage and double-strand breaks are beginning to be recognized as stimuli in these contexts as well. Retrotransposable elements have been found to activate the Type I interferon response dependent on cGAS and STING (De Cecco et al., 2019; Simon et al., 2019). Transposable element dysregulation has been found to cause neuronal death in tauopathies such as AD (W. Sun et al., 2018). Nuclear DNA double-stranded breaks have been associated with AD (W. Sun et al., 2018). Using a mouse model that accumulates neuronal DSBs, cGAS expression has been found to be upregulated along with interferon transcriptional programming which causes microglia activation (Welch et al., 2022). Teasing apart whether nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, or both, is the culprit behind interferon signaling in neurodegenerative disease is not yet clear, but future studies in this area may help elucidate the timeline of events and primary versus secondary contributors to these diseases.

The translatability of pharmaceuticals must be properly assessed before considering specific drugs for human patients. There are considerable molecular differences between murine STING and human STING (Shih et al., 2018), and some agonists for murine STING are ineffective in activating human STING. DMXAA, for example, showed excellent promise preclinically but failed in clinical trials due to its specificity for murine but not human STING (Conlon et al., 2013). Rat STING, however, appears to more closely mimic how human STING responds to agonists (H. Zhang et al., 2015). Use of multiple animal models may be beneficial for assessing STING as a therapeutic target due to these known differences. Alternatively, targeting other proteins in the STING pathway, such as NLRX1 (Fritsch et al., 2022; H. Guo et al., 2016), may be an option. The therapeutic attractiveness of the STING pathway either by the use of agonists or inhibitors will continue to explode as pharmaceutical companies move these compounds to clinical trials targeting a variety of diseases and disorders. Considering that STING inhibitors have yet to enter clinical trials, side effects will have to be carefully evaluated (Sheridan, 2019). While there remains much to learn about STING, particularly in the context of neuroinflammation, answering these questions will pave the way for the use of STING-based therapeutics.

8 | CONCLUSION

The rapid pace at which researchers have found STING involvement in different disease states since its discovery in 2008 will continue to expand as neuroinflammation is implicated in so many pathophysiological processes. Additional studies will need to confirm these original findings where STING signaling has already been implicated in neuroscience. However, the work being done on the cGAS-STING pathway has moved the field one step closer to understanding the complicated web of neuroinflammation.

FIGURE 1 Mechanism of cGAS-STING signaling. Possible triggers for cGAS-STING signaling discussed in this review are boxed in light blue. DNA binds to cGAS to facilitate dimerization to produce cyclic dinucleotide 2′,3′-cyclic GMP–AMP (2′,3′-cGAMP). cGAMP binds to STING which promotes its dimerization/oligomerization. COP-II vesicles transport STING to the Golgi to activate TBK1. Dimerized TBK1 then phosphorylates IRF3 for nuclear translocation for the transcription of IFN-responsive genes.

FIGURE 2 Following a stroke or TBI, cGAS-STING signaling in resident microglia is activated, likely at least in part due to the presence of mitochondrial DNA. Microglia subsequently produce interferons (primarily IFNβ) and chemokines that result in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells. Once present, these immune cells are also activated and produce additional interferons. Interferons produced by all cell types can bind both their own and other cells’ IFN receptors, IFNAR, including neurons and astrocytes, resulting in increased IFN signaling.
