Objective

To test the hypothesis that Lewy body pathology (LBs) is present in the spinal cord of older community-dwelling adults without a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD).

Methods

We studied 162 prospective autopsies from older adults with PD (N=6) and without PD (N=156). We documented the presence of LBs in cerebrum and brainstem structures from each of the 6 regions used for Braak PD staging and 4 spinal cord levels (C5/6, T7, L4/5 and S4/5). Parkinsonism proximate to death was based on a previously validated measure present if 2 or more of the 4 signs of parkinsonism were present based on a modified version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).

Results

Fifty-three of 156 individuals without PD (34%) had LBs in a least one site within the CNS. About half of cases with LBs in the cerebrum or brainstem, (25/53, 47%) also had spinal LBs. Almost 90% (22/25 88%) of cases with spinal LBs had LBs in the cerebrum (Braak stages 4–6) and about 10% (3/25, 12%) had only brainstem LBs (Braak stages 1–3). Four of 6 cases with PD showed LBs in cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord. Individuals with LBs in the spinal cord were more likely to have clinical parkinsonism proximate to death compared to individuals with LBs in brainstem and cerebrum alone (52% vs 32%; Chi-Square х2 = 5.368, df = 1, p = 0.0.021) and more severe nigral neuronal loss (48%% vs 11%; Chi-Square х2 = 9.049, df = 1, p = 0.003). These findings were unchanged when we included cases with a history of PD.

Conclusion

Older community-dwelling adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD have evidence of LBs throughout the CNS including the spinal cord which is associated with parkinsonism and more severe nigral neuronal loss.

INTRODUCTION

Sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an uncommon cause of motor impairment in community-dwelling older adults with its prevalence estimated to be up to 5% by the age of 85 years.(43) The histopathologic hallmarks of PD are the presence of α-synuclein positive nigral Lewy bodies (LBs) and nigral neuronal loss. (14) In prior studies in this cohort we have documented Lewy body pathology (LBs) in up to 35% of older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD.(20, 43) These studies suggest that the presence of LBs pathology in the cerebrum and brainstem of older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD is associated with more severe parkinsonism. While PD is uncommon in the broader population of older adults, parkinsonism may affect 50% or more of community-dwelling adults aged 85 or older.(18, 21) The motor system extends from the cerebrum to influence the spinal cord which regulates muscle activity, the final effector of all movement. Thus, LBs in the cerebrum and brainstem of community-dwelling older adults without a diagnosis of PD may not fully account for the clinical severity of parkinsonism.(19, 20)

Standard staging protocols for PD have been based on the extent to which LBs pathology is documented in brainstem and cerebrum structures.(3, 14, 15, 24, 31, 37, 42, 53) Recent studies of sporadic PD have shown that LBs extend beyond the cerebrum and brainstem and are present in both motor and non-motor structures in the spinal cord.(4, 25, 48) This suggests that LBs in motor structures outside the cerebrum and brainstem may contribute to parkinsonism in older adults without PD.(19) Most studies which have examined LBs in adults without PD have focused on the cerebrum and brainstem, (31) but several recent studies have also reported that LBs are also present in the spinal cord.(4, 11, 25, 36, 45, 46) However, the relationship of spinal LBs with parkinsonism proximate to death is unclear since these latter postmortem studies have not included clinical assessments of parkinsonism.

To fill this gap, we employed a structured postmortem examination of cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord specimens from well-characterized community-dwelling older adults participating in the Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-autopsy study.(6) We examined tissue samples from cerebrum and brainstem structures from each of 6 regions used in Braak PD staging for LBs and 4 levels of the spinal cord.(14) Then, we examined the association of LBs in different CNS regions with other brain pathologies. Finally, we examined the association of LBs in the spinal cord with the presence of clinical parkinsonism proximate to death, using a previously validated categorical measure of parkinsonism.(21)

METHODS

Subjects

Participants were from the Memory and Aging Project which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. Each subject signed an informed consent for annual exam and an anatomic gift act for donation of brain and spinal cord at the time of death.(6)

MAP began in 1997 and its structured postmortem exam for LBs was limited to the cerebrum and substantia nigra. The current prospective study added the collection of LBs pathologies from additional sites outside the cerebrum began in 2013. Collection of postmortem indices was done blinded to any clinical data.162 cases with complete post-mortem data were available at the time of these analyses and their clinical and postmortem data are shown in Table 1.

Assessment of Cognition and Cognitive Status

Each year, trained technicians administered 19 cognitive tests; 17 tests were used to generate a composite measure of global cognition as previously described (Appendix Method).(5, 6) Clinical diagnoses were made in a three step process. Cognitive testing was scored by a computer and reviewed by a neuropsychologist to diagnose cognitive impairment. Then participants were evaluated by a physician who used all cognitive and clinical data to classify cognitive function as previously described.(12) After death, a physician, blinded to autopsy data, reviewed all available cognitive and clinical data to assign a final clinical diagnoses. Dementia and its causes was diagnosed using the guidelines of the joint working group of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association.(34)

Assessment and Categorization of Parkinsonism

Assessment

Structured clinical evaluation included a modified version of the United Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (mUPDRS) including 26 items assessing 4 parkinsonian signs.(5–8) A sign was considered present if 2 or more of their respective items had at least a score of 1 indicating a mild abnormality. Categorization: We used a previously validated categorical measure for the presence of parkinsonism if 2 or more of the 4 signs were documented. No parkinsonism was present if there were none or 1 of the 4 signs was present.(21)

Diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease

As has been done in prior studies from this cohort and by other investigators, a clinical diagnosis of PD was based on review of medical records or self-report of a clinical diagnosis of PD for which the participant received levodopa or dopaminergic agonist medications.(20, 44)

Neuropathological Examination

A uniform gross and microscopic examination with quantification of pathologic indices followed a standard protocol.(20, 21) Pathologic examination was done blinded to any clinical data and (median interval 7.25 hrs, range 4.2 to 39 hrs) assessed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, chronic macroinfarcts and microinfarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Appendix Method).

Our prior LB assessment was expanded to include a total of 17 cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord sites (Table 2, Column 1).

Cerebrum

The 7 supratentorial cerebrum regions sampled included the primary motor, Heschl’s, mid-frontal, mid-temporal, inferior parietal and entorhinal cortices and these with the amygdala allowed grading for the PD Braak Stages 4, 5 and 6.(14)

Brainstem

Midbrain

Two levels of the midbrain were blocked, one at the level of the exiting 3rd nerve fibers and the other at the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles to allow examination of the substantia nigra and the pedunculopontine nucleus for the grading of PD Braak Stage 3.

Pons

A block of the pons included locus coeruleus while a block taken just below the the pontomedullary junction contained nucleus gigantocellularis and both blocks allowed grading of the PD Braak Stage 2.

Medulla

A block of medulla which included the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus was examined for grading PD Braak Stage 1.

Olfactory bulb and tract were also assessed for grading PD Braak Stage 1.

Spinal Cord

In addition, 4 blocks of the spinal cord were obtained (C5/6, T7, L4/5 and S4/5). The following regions were examined: the anterior and posterior horns, the intermediolateral column in the thoracic cord and autonomic column in the sacral cord as outlined in Figure 1. Blocks processed using standard techniques were embedded in paraffin and 6µm sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined to ensure that the required structures were included in the block.

Assessment of Lewy Body Pathology

We employed immunohistochemistry to identify LBs in paraffin sections (6µm) using a Leica-Bond Max autostainer (Leica Microsystems Inc., New Buffalo, IL). Antigen retrieval was done by heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min. An antibody to phosphorylated α-Synuclein (pSyn#64;Wako Cat. No. 015-25191; 1:20,000, Wako Chem. USA, Richmond, VA) and the BondTM Polymer Refine Red Detection Kit utilizing alkaline phosphatase with a Fast Red chromogen was used. Lewy bodies were recorded and analyzed as dichotomous variables as previously described. (20)

Staging of Lewy Body Pathology

We dichotomized the presence of LBs in each of the 6 general regions used for the Braak PD stages (Table 2) based on the presence of LBs in 1 or more of the sites sampled for each stage. The highest region with LBs was used for final Braak staging of cases with LBs. The Braak PD staging does not include an assessment of spinal LBs.(14) We dichotomized the presence of spinal LBs based on the presence of LBs in one or more of the 4 spinal cord levels which were examined (Table 1, Column 2).

Nigral Neuronal Loss

We assessed the degree of nigral neuronal loss in 6 micron sections of the substantia nigra from the mid to rostral midbrain near or at the exit of the 3rd nerve with H&amp;E stain using a semi-quantitative scale (0–3).(20)

Mapping the distribution of Lewy Bodies in the brainstem and spinal cord

Brainstem and spinal cord of two additional female participants with parkinsonism with and without a clinical diagnosis of PD proximate to death were processed for the purpose of mapping the distribution of Lewy bodies. Tissue was cut at 60µm sections and stained per a free floating protocol as previously described. (48) Selected, full sections were digitized using an Olympus microscope and Olivia software at 40× magnification. Sections were uploaded in Adobe Illustrator for mapping of pathological markers and reconstruction of outlines.

Statistical Approach

We used logistic regressions to examine the relationship between LBs, age and sex using a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (0.05/17 regions=0.003). We employed separate logistic regression models controlling for age, sex and education, to document the association of postmortem indices with LBs in cerebrum and brainstem regions based on the Braak stages and in the spinal cord. In cases with LBs in the cerebrum or brainstem, we employed Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction to determine whether the presence of parkinsonism and nigral neuronal loss varied with spinal LBs. Since the current study was focused on delineating the clinical heterogeneity of LBs in older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD, cases with a clinical diagnosis of PD were excluded from our primary analyses. We repeated these analyses adding in the cases with PD. All analyses were carried out using SAS/STAT software Version 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) on a Hewlett Packard ProLiant ML350 server running LINUX. (40)

RESULTS

Table 1 summarizes the clinical and post-mortem characteristics of all the cases examined in this study stratifying them based on the presence or absence of a clinical diagnosis of PD proximate to death. Table 2 lists the 13 cerebrum and brainstem sites and 4 spinal cord levels which were examined. LBs in these 17 sites did not show an association with age or sex (results are not shown).

Lewy Body Pathology in Spinal Cord

LBs were observed in 1 or more of the 17 sites in more than 1/3 (53/156, 34%) of cases without a diagnosis of PD (Table 2). About half (25 of 53, 47%) of the cases with LBs had LBs at 1 or more of the spinal cord levels. Spinal LBs were present in all 4 levels of the spinal cord. About 30% of cases with spinal LBs showed LBs at all 4 levels (N=7, 28%) [3 levels: N=6 (24%); 2 levels: N=6 (24%); and 1 level: N=6 (24%)]. As illustrated in Figure 1, at all 4 levels of the spinal cord, there was a slight propensity for LBs to be located more frequently in the posterior horn.

Distribution of Lewy Body Pathology in Spinal Cord, Brainstem and Cerebrum

About 70% of cases without a clinical diagnosis of PD (37/53, 70%) had LBs in both brainstem and cerebrum, in 20% (12/53, 23%) LBs were restricted to brainstem structures and 10% (4/53, 8%) showed LBs only in the cerebrum.

About half of cases (28 of 53, 51%) with LBs in the brainstem and cerebrum did not show LBs in the spinal cord. In contrast, cases with spinal LBs, about 90% (22/25, 88%) showed LBs extending throughout brainstem and cerebrum including neocortical LBs, about 10% (3/25 12%) showed LBs restricted to the brainstem. There were no cases with LBs restricted to the spinal cord (Table 2). To illustrate the distribution of LBs in cases with and without spinal LBs, we dichotomized the presence of LBs in the cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord. Figure 2, shows that individuals with spinal LBs showed more widespread distribution of LBs in brainstem and cerebrum structures as compared to cases without spinal LBs.

Association of Lewy Body Pathology with Age-Related Brain Pathologies

We used logistic regression models controlling for age and sex to examine the association of the presence of any LBs in Braak staging regions or the presence of any spinal LBs with other age-related post-mortem brain indices. The presence of any LBs in Braak staging regions or in the spinal cord was strongly associated with nigral neuronal loss, an important index of PD pathology. LBs in Braak staging regions showed marginal associations with AD pathology, macroinfarcts and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Table 3).

Distribution of Lewy Body Pathology in cases with PD Proximate to Death

Six cases examined in this study had a history of PD proximate to death. Their clinical and postmortem data are included in Table 1. Four of 6 showed evidence of widespread LBs in cerebrum and brainstem (Braak stage 6) as well as spinal LBs as observed in the cases without a clinical diagnosis of PD proximate to death who showed spinal LBs as shown in Figure 2.

Three of 4 showed LBs at all 4 levels of the spinal cord and one showed LBs restricted to the cervical spinal cord. As illustrated in Figure 1, the distribution of LBs in the spinal cord of cases with PD was greater posteriorly similar to spinal LBs in cases without a history of PD.

The propensity for widespread distribution of LBs in cases with spinal LBs is illustrated in two female participants with parkinsonism with and without a clinical diagnosis of PD proximate to death. LBs are observed throughout the brainstem and spinal cord in both cases. However, the density of LBs appears greater in the case with PD (Figure 3).

Lewy Body Pathology and Parkinsonism Proximate to Death

About 35% of individuals with LBs (19/53, 36%) showed clinical signs of parkinsonism proximate to death. Individuals with LBs in the spinal cord were more likely to have exhibited parkinsonism proximate to death (13/25, 52%) as compared to those without LBs in the spinal cord (6/28, 32%) (Chi-Square х2 = 5.368, df = 1, p = 0.0.021). Moreover, there were more individuals with LBs in the spinal cord who showed moderate or severe nigral neuronal loss (12/25, 48%) compared to individuals with LBs without spinal cord involvement (3/28, 11%) (Chi-Square х2 = 9.049, df = 1, p = 0.003). These results were unchanged when we added the cases with PD. The presence of spinal LBs was associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism proximate to death (parkinsonism: Chi-Square х2 = 8.187, df = 1, p = 0.004) and more severe nigral neuronal loss (nigral neuronal loss: (Chi-Square х2 = 12.671, df = 1, p = &lt;0.001).

DISCUSSION

We found that more than 1/3 of 154 well-characterized community-dwelling older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD proximate to death showed evidence of LBs within the CNS. About half of the cases with LBs in cerebrum or brainstem structures also had LBs in the spinal cord, but there were no cases with LBs restricted to the spinal cord. More than 90% of cases with LB pathology in the spinal cord had LBs in the cerebrum. Individuals with LBs in the spinal cord had a higher odds of clinical parkinsonism and more severe nigral neuronal loss compared to individuals with LBs in rostral cerebrum structures, but without LBs in the spinal cord. These data suggest that Lewy body pathology is common in older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD, accumulates throughout the CNS including the spinal cord and may contribute to parkinsonism and nigral neuronal loss in older adults without a clinical diagnosis of PD.

Building on clinical-pathologic studies in PD showing that LBs extend to the spinal cord,(25, 45, 48) several studies have reported spinal LBs in older adults without PD.(11, 25, 33, 36, 45, 46) A single population based study in cases 85 years or older reported that about 1/3 of cases had evidence of classical LBs in thoracic or sacral spinal cord.(36) This population study assessed thoracic and sacral spinal cord for LBs in all cases, but did not assess cortical regions unless LBs were found in the substantia nigra or limbic samples In addition, this study did not assess other brainstem sites or the olfactory bulb or include clinical characterization of parkinsonism proximate to death. The sampling approach employed in this study may account for their finding of about 20% of cases with isolated spinal LBs. Nevertheless, in about 80% of their cases with spinal LBs there was evidence of LBs in the cerebrum especially in neocortex.(36) In contrast, a much smaller study of LBs in PD and incidental LBs reported that six controls, older adults without clinical PD, did not have any evidence of LB pathology in the cerebrum or spinal cord.(25) Four additional studies reported that 8%–33% of cases of older adults without PD showed evidence of LBs in the spinal cord. These latter studies employed more extensive sampling of brainstem and cerebrum and there were no cases of isolated spinal LBs.(11, 33, 45, 46) Since case selection, the locations and number of CNS sites examined have varied among prior studies, it is difficult to compare the detection rates and distribution patterns of LBs within the CNS.

The current study extends previous reports about spinal LBs in older adults without PD. First, the overall frequency of spinal LBs in the current study was 18% which is similar to the average frequency of about 20% reported by several previous studies.(11, 33, 36, 45) Second, we did not find any cases with LBs restricted to the spinal cord. (11, 33, 36, 45) Third, almost all the cases with spinal LBs showed LBs in the brainstem and cerebrum, especially the neocortex with few cases showing LBs restricted to the spinal cord and brainstem. Finally, spinal LBs were associated with more severe nigral neuronal loss in the brainstem.(28, 36)

The paucity of isolated LBs in the spinal cord in the current study and in several prior reports, suggest that spinal LBs is unlikely to represent the earliest manifestations of LBs within the CNS, as suggested by some, but not all, studies.(14, 36) Moreover, it seems more likely that LBs affect brainstem and cerebrum structures before affecting the spinal cord. (25, 45) (13) In the current study, individuals with spinal LBs most commonly had widespread distribution of LBs in brainstem and both limbic and neocortical structures. In contrast, as illustrated in Figure 2, individuals without LBs in the spinal cord showed less widely distributed LBs in brainstem and cerebrum. For example in cases without spinal LBs, it was more common to observe LBs in limbic structures without more rostral cerebrum. Thus, the data in the current study suggests that the presence of spinal LBs may indicate more severe CNS accumulation of LBs.(35, 41) The association between spinal LBs and the severity of nigral neuronal loss also suggests that spinal LBs may be an indicator of more severe or chronic disease.

Several different pathways have been suggested to explain the progressive accumulation of LBs within the CNS in PD.(53) For example there might be transmission of LBs to the spinal cord via rostral CNS structures through the olfactory system or from outside the CNS directly to the spinal cord via the gastrointestinal tract or bladder.(2, 26) These different pathways might account for some of the differences in the reported distributions of LBs within the spinal cord and rostral CNS structures.(45, 47, 53) Since traditional staging systems for LBs were developed in non-population based cohorts, differences in case selection may also account for some reports which do not conform to traditional staging of LBs progression.(53) The current study did not have sufficient power to use analytic approaches which have been employed successfully to stage other neuropathologies.(32) Postmortem studies can only provide cross sectional data, antemortem imaging for LBs or the use of other biomarkers are needed to provide a more detailed knowledge about the biologic substrate underlying the of LBs both within and outside CNS structures.(4)

The nature and nosology of subclinical or preclinical PD i.e. parkinsonism remains unclear, because the clinical correlates of LB pathology in older persons without a clinical diagnosis of PD are not well-characterized. Until recently the correlates of pathologic AD and cognition in older adults was also unknown. Recognition of the heterogeneity of cognition associated with pathologic AD required the prospective cognitive assessment of large numbers of older adults undergoing autopsy without case selection based on postmortem findings. This approach led to the reconceptualization of pathologic AD as having an asymptomatic stage (NCI) followed by a mild cognitive impairment stage (MCI), with AD dementia being a late manifestation of the disease process (29).

Like other common chronic neurologic and non-neurologic conditions of aging, pathology, in this case LB pathology, accumulates over many years prior to clinical manifestations of the pathology and a diagnosis of PD. Therefore as we have done in prior studies, we leveraged the successful approach which led to the reclassification of pathologic AD to characterize the clinical heterogeneity of LB pathology in the spinal cord.(16–18, 20, 21, 23) As illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, to avoid truncating the distribution of the clinical spectrum of parkinsonism associated with LB pathology, we included all cases and did not exclude cases based on their postmortem findings. Nonetheless, to focus our primary analyses on prodromal PD, as we and others have done in prior studies, we excluded cases with a clinical diagnosis of PD.(20, 44) Despite the potential for misclassification of clinical PD early in the course of PD or when the diagnosis is made by a non-movement disorder specialist, our findings were unchanged when we repeated our analyses and included individuals with a clinical diagnosis of PD.(1, 27)

The results of the current study lend support for notion that clinical PD may be preceded by an asymptomatic and prodromal phase during which parkinsonian signs may be insufficient for a clinical diagnosis of PD despite the widespread accumulation of LB pathology throughout the CNS (Figures 1–3). Recent work in older adults without clinical PD shows that the presence of LBs in older brains is associated with a wide range of adverse health outcomes and impaired clinical functions including parkinsonism, suggesting that LBs is neither benign nor incidental. (19–22, 51, 52) The current findings that more than 1/3 of community-dwelling older persons without a clinical diagnosis of PD may have LBs within the CNS is similar to prior studies (30, 42), and underscores the magnitude of the public health problem posed by LBs in our aging population. For example, the presence of clinical parkinsonism with postmortem LBs was noted in 12% of cases which is up to 4-fold larger than prior estimates of PD in adults older than 80 years old.(38) Moreover, our findings that individuals with spinal LBs have more severe parkinsonism and nigral neuronal loss than those with LBs limited to rostral CNS structures, suggests that even among older individuals without PD in which LBs are accumulating, there may be subgroups who have a higher risk for adverse health outcomes and motor deficits. Similar subgroups have been suggested for subgroups of adults with different manifestations of clinical PD.(50)

While the current study was focused on the spinal cord and parkinsonism, more than 20% of cases with dementia proximate to death had both LBs and parkinsonism which suggests possible LB dementia (LBD) which is more than 4-fold greater than prior reports.(49) Together the clinical and postmortem data in the current data suggest that the prevalence of synucleinopathies including PD and LBD may be underestimated in community dwelling older adults, who are not usually examined by movement disorder specialists. Thus, synucleinopathies may make a much larger contribution to loss of motor and cognitive function in older adults. Given the public health consequences, further work is needed for the early detection and potential treatments of individuals at risk for accumulating LBs prior to death.(9, 10, 25, 28, 39, 45)

There are several limitations to the current study. The cases we studied are from a selected cohort that differs in important ways such as age and education from the general population and those who develop idiopathic PD who are generally younger. It will be important to investigate these findings in more diverse cohorts and to increase the number of cases both with and without PD. Clinical assessments were not performed by a movement disorders specialist, which might underestimate the number of cases with clinical PD or LBD. Dichotomizing the presence or absence of LBs in different locations might decrease power in identifying the full range of clinical associations of LBs and underestimate the number of cases with mild LB pathology. More extensive sampling and quantifying the density of α-synuclein and Lewy neurites might provide a more complete description of the distribution and accumulation of LBs within the CNS and determine the extent to which spinal LBs are independently associated with parkinsonism and other clinical symptoms proximate to death.

There are several strengths to the study, including the community-based cohort with large numbers of women and men coming to autopsy following high rates of clinical follow-up with a widely used instrument to assess parkinsonism and high autopsy rates. Uniform prospective structured postmortem procedures were also used to assess cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord for in all cases.

The number of cases with Lewy bodies in individuals without a history of PD in the posterior horn (black) and anterior horn (white) of the cervical (A), thoracic (B), lumbar (C) and sacral (D) spinal cord levels. Also shown are the number of cases with Lewy bodies in the thoracic (B) intermediolateral column (yellow) and sacral (D) parasympathetic column (yellow). In all regions, the number of cases with Lewy bodies in individuals with PD are shown in red. α-Synuclein immunostaining shows Lewy bodies (arrowheads) and Lewy neurites in the posterior horn (E), intermediolateral column (F) and sacral parasympathetic column (G). (A–D Luxol-fast blue and hematoxylin-eosin stain. E–F ×200 original magnification).

Figure 2 Distribution of Lewy Body Pathology (LBs) in the Cerebrum, Brainstem and Spinal Cord

This figure summarizes the LB data collected from all the cases in this study. For each of the participants who showed LBs in any of the 17 sites examined (N=57), we dichotomized the presence or absence of Lewy bodies in each of the following three regions: 1) Cerebrum (Red, Braak stages 4–6), 2) Brainstem and olfactory bulb (Green, Braak 1–3) and 3) Spinal Cord (Blue). Grey indicates no LBs. Cases with a history of PD (n=4) are shown with hatches. Of the 29 individuals with LBs in the spinal cord, 26 (90%) also had LBs in in both the cerebrum and brainstem. In contrast, of the 28 individuals with LBs yet without spinal LBs, only 15 (54%) had accumulation of LBs in both brainstem and cerebrum.

Figure 3 Lewy body pathology extends throughout the brainstem and spinal cord in both older adults with and without a diagnosis of PD proximate to death

Representative formalin-fixed brainstem and spinal cord sections, selected from a complete series, stained with α-synuclein to document Lewy bodies (magenta). Two cases from the Memory and Aging Project were studied including: one with a clinical diagnosis of PD (left) and one without a diagnosis of PD (right) at the time of death. Lewy bodies are observed throughout the brainstem and spinal cord in both cases, but the density appears greater in PD.
