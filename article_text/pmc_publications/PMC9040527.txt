Alzheimer’s disease severely perturbs the transition metal homeostasis in the brain leading to the accumulation of excess metals in extracellular and intraneuronal locations. The amyloid beta protein binds these transition metals, ultimately causing severe oxidative stress in the brain. Metal chelation therapy is an approach to sequester metals from amyloid beta and relieve the oxidative stress. Here we have designed a mixed N/O donor Cu chelator inspired by the proposed ligand set of Cu in amyloid beta. We demonstrate that the chelator effectively removes Cu from amyloid beta and suppresses ROS production by redox silencing and radical scavenging both in vitro and in cellulo. The impact of ROS on the extent of oxidation of the different aggregated forms of the peptide is studied by mass spectrometry, which, along with other ROS assays, shows that the oligomers are pro-oxidants in nature. The aliphatic Leu34, which was previously unobserved, has been identified as a new oxidation site.

Graphical Abstract

A rationally designed mixed Cu chelator mitigates Cu-Aβ induced reactive oxygen species by redox silencing and radical scavenging. The presence of oxidized amino acids in Aβ correlates to their role in the entatic state.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and progressive behavioral changes, which accounts for ~80% of total dementia-related diseases.[1,2] Currently, there are ~5 million people living with AD in the US.[2] According to the Alzheimer’s association, the number is expected to rise to ~13 million by 2050, costing ~1.1 trillion USD on patient care.[3] The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) estimates AD as the 6th leading cause of death in the US.[4] Approximately 50% of primary care physicians believe that the medical profession is not ready to provide care for the growing number of dementia patients.[5]

The severity of AD is caused by various factors such as oxidative stress, amyloid beta (Aβ) misfolding, hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, and acetylcholine dysfunction.[6–10] According to the amyloid hypothesis, it is thought that Aβ produced from imperfect processing of the amyloid precursor protein is a major contributor.[11] Out of the two forms, Aβ42 is considered more neurotoxic than Aβ40.[12] According to the amyloid cascade theory, the amyloid plaques produced from Aβ aggregation plays an etiological role in AD.[13] Aβ exists as a heterogeneous polymorphic assembly ranging from soluble oligomers to insoluble fibrils and plaques. Recent evidence has shown that oligomers cause severe brain damage where the number of oligomers correlate with cognitive impairment in AD patients, triggering the debate that the oligomers are the primary neurotoxic species instead of the insoluble plaques.[10,14–19] From animal studies it has been shown that the oligomers are associated with an increase in synaptic loss and inhibition of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.[20,21] The oligomers are generated from the disordered monomeric peptide, ultimately maturing to fibrils via the onpathway mechanism.[14] The oligomers are also produced via a secondary nucleation pathway when the monomers combine with fibrils and the fibrils undergo fragmentation. The soluble and diffusible nature of the oligomers allow them to easily interact with intracellular components and with the synaptic joints, which leads to extensive damage and neurotoxicity.[15] In addition to these mechanisms, oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) poses a severe threat in AD.[22–25]

Metal ions play crucial roles in biology.[26] Transition metals such as Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe2+ found in numerous enzymes and neurotransmitters,[27] are tightly regulated to ensure that the amount of free metal ions is minimized. However, in AD, these metals are severely dysregulated, leading to extracellular deposits of Cu2+ and Zn2+ while Fe2+ primarily accumulates inside the neurons.[16] The concentrations of free metal ions such as Cu2+ can reach up to ~0.4 mM in the brain of AD patients.[16,23] Aβ binds Cu2+ via Asp1, His6, His13, His14, and a backbone amide of Ala2, all located at the polar N-terminal region of the peptide.[18,28] In the presence of O2 and reducing agents like ascorbic acid (Asc), which is present at ~0.2–10 mM concentrations in the brain,[29] Cu-Aβ undergoes catalytic redox cycling to generate ROS such as O2•–, H2O2, and OH• via the Fenton-Haber-Weiss reaction pathway (Scheme 1).[18,19,30,31] The redox cycling between Cu2+ and Cu+ states is facilitated by a preorganized electron transfer mechanism (POET) that is proposed to lower the reorganization energy by 0.3 eV, thus facilitating electron transfer and ROS production.[32,33] An increased amount of oxidized proteins is found in the hippocampus and cortex as these regions are frequently affected in AD.[34] In addition, ROS-induced oxidation of lipids to 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) leads to the disruption of signal transduction.[35] In addition to HNE, acrolein and malondialdehyde are produced as secondary products, originating from stable ROS species.[36] Oxidized DNA and RNA bases are also well-documented biomarkers of oxidative stress in AD.[17]

Metal chelation therapy is continuously expanding,[26–29] which involves the use of ligands to chelate and remove the metal ions from Aβ.[41–46] There are certain characteristics that must be met to use the ligands in chelation therapy, such as their ability to bind metal ions with high affinity- higher than the Aβ peptides, being sufficiently hydrophobic to cross the blood-brain barrier, being non-toxic, and preventing Aβ aggregation. In addition, the designed chelator must display selectivity for the redox active metals like Cu2+ compared to redox inactive and more abundant Zn2+ as Zn2+ is present in higher concentrations compared to Cu2+ in the synaptic clefts as well as the plaques.[47,48] The chelator should also bind both redox states of Cu, redox silence Cu, and kinetically remove Cu2+ faster from the Cu-Aβ complex.[49] In this regard, several natural products,[50–52] peptide-based inhibitors,[26,28] and synthetic molecules [38,40,53,54] have been investigated to mitigate the effect of Aβ-induced AD pathogenesis.

Pederson et al.[55] have studied Cu-catalyzed ROS generation by the monomeric and fibrillar forms of Aβ40 as well as the monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar forms of α-synuclein (αS). The fibrillar and oligomeric forms are shown to be radical scavengers, preferentially over the monomers. The aggregated forms of the proteins reduced ROS formation by lowering the rate of redox cycling of Cu2+ and sequestering Cu2+ from solution. However this study was performed with Aβ40, which is proposed to be less toxic than Aβ42. In addition, the ROS generation by Aβ oligomers was not studied. In another report[56], Huang et al. investigated Cu-catalyzed O2•−, OH• and H2O2 generation in Aβ16, Aβ40 and Aβ42 using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), which showed that the O2•− is formed first, prior to OH• and H2O2. In the monomeric forms of each peptide, the extent of ROS generation decreased with increasing peptide length. In addition, the fibrillar forms of each peptide produced the least amount of ROS followed by the oligomers and monomers.

In our previous report, we probed the antioxidant versus pro-oxidant role of different types of Aβ42 conformers towards Cu-catalyzed ROS generation.[50] We found that the oligomers prepared in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (AβO-PBS) generated more ROS than the monomers and fibrils. In addition, while other conformers underwent ROS-induced morphological damage, the oligomers were resistant to such changes. This result suggested that the ROS produced by the oligomers can inflict a more detrimental effect to other cellular components, compared to the other conformers. We also showed that the natural polyphenol kaempferol lowered the ROS generation, altered the morphology of Aβ conformers, and redirected the aggregation pathway. Here we present the design of a molecular Cu chelator (L) that effectively sequesters Cu2+ from Cu2+-Aβ, decreasing the ROS generation in vitro as well as in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Mass spectrometry is used to further quantify the extent of Aβ oxidation and to identify the oxidation sites.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Chelator design:

The chelator L is designed to bind Cu2+ in a 1:1 fashion via the N-atoms from three pyridine donors and an O-atom from a carboxylate moiety (Fig. 1). The structure of the tetradentate chelator is preorganized to accommodate multiple geometries, including distorted trigonal bipyramidal or octahedral geometries. Under physiological conditions, the carboxylic acid group of L will be deprotonated to give an anionic species with enhanced water solubility. We reasoned that the nitrogen and oxygen donors of L would bind well to Cu2+, given that amino acids such as histidine and aspartate are common donors to copper in Aβ. The coordination chemistry of L was investigated by metalation with Cu2+ salt as described in the Supporting Information. Elemental analysis and high-resolution mass spectrometry confirm that L binds to Cu2+ in a 1:1 ratio (Scheme S1), consistent with the proposed structure shown in Fig. 1 of Cu2+ coordination. Unlike many small molecule chelators, the water solubility of L is advantageous to study its interaction with Aβ. The UV-vis spectrum of the complex is characterized by absorption features at ~725 and 1000 nm (Fig. S1 red). An identical spectrum is obtained when 10-fold L is added to Cu(ClO4)2 (Fig. S1 blue). These features are different than the single absorption at ~775 nm observed for Cu(ClO4)2 alone (Fig. S1 black). The Cu1+ binding affinity for L is derived from the Bcs assay (Bcs = Bathocuproinedisulfonate), anaerobically at pH 7.5.[57] We titrated Bcs2− to a solution of 15 μM Cu1+ with 30 μM L. A two-fold excess L is used to minimize free Cu1+ in solution. A plot of [Cu(Bcs)2]3− vs the equivalence of Bcs2− shows saturation at 2:1 ratio of Bcs2−:Cu1+ (Fig. S2), suggestive of the formation of 1:1 CuL complex. From this experiment, a Cu1+ binding affinity of 6.5 fM has been derived according to eq. i. The cyclic voltammogram of the complex (Fig. S3) shows a reductive peak at −0.37V vs Ag/AgCl and two oxidation peaks at −0.25V and −0.02V. Given a negative reduction potential, the Cu2+ affinity for L is expected to be on the order of fM or higher.

Mitigation of Cu-Aβ induced ROS production by the chelator:

ROS production by Cu-Aβ and the effect of the chelator in suppressing the ROS was assessed by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Three complimentary assays are employed to measure the ROS production by monitoring i) the decay kinetics from the oxidation of Asc, ii) spectrophotometric detection of H2O2 by amplex red assay, and iii) fluorometric detection of OH• by coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (3-CCA) assay. Consistent with our previous results,[50] we find that the degree of ROS generation is dependent on the aggregation state of Aβ42. As seen from the Asc oxidation presented in Fig. 2A–C, the AβO-PBS (Fig. 2B, black) consumed Asc the fastest compared to the monomers (AβM) (Fig. 2A, black), fibrils (AβF-PBS) (Fig. 2C, black), and free Cu2+ in solution (Fig. 2A, orange). AβM and AβF-BS consumed ~80% and ~90% of the total Asc, respectively, in 50 minutes, while AβO-PBS consumed ~90% Asc within 25 minutes with a ~2-fold higher rate (Table S1). AβO-PBS and AβF-PBS displayed higher rates of Asc oxidation than AβM, ~3-fold and ~2-fold faster, respectively, suggesting differential rates of electron transfer between Asc and Cu2+ site, depending on the nature of the conformer. This could be attributed to the inherent packing of the peptide in each conformer that dictates the rates of electron transfer governed by the accessibility of Asc to the active sites. Overall, the AβO-PBS behaved as pro-oxidants since an overall faster Asc decay is observed in this conformer compared to the other conformers and free Cu2+. The AβO-PBS (Fig. 2E, black) produced the highest amount of H2O2, ~39 μM, at the highest rate (Table S1) compared to AβM (Fig. 2D, black), AβF-PBS (Fig. 2F, black), and free Cu2+ (Fig. 2D, orange). AβM and AβF-PBS produced ~34 and ~30 μM H2O2 at comparable rates. We also probed the generation of OH• (Fig. 2G–I). We find that compared to free Cu2+ (Fig. 2G, orange), AβM (Fig. 2G, black) and AβF-PBS (Fig. 2I, black) generated lower amounts of the radical. Intriguingly, the oligomers generated higher amounts of OH• than free Cu2+, suggesting a pro-oxidant behavior of the oligomers as opposed to the antioxidant behavior of the monomers and fibrils. We attribute this effect to an enhanced radical scavenging ability of the peptide in the monomeric and fibrillar forms compared to the oligomers. This notion is supported by MALDI data (vide infra).

We next investigated whether L sequestered Cu2+ from the Cu2+-Aβ42 complex and if it inhibits ROS generation. We find that in all of the assays, L inhibits ROS generation significantly (Fig. 2, green traces; Fig. S4, Table S1), preventing the fast kinetics of Asc oxidation by ~6.5-fold in monomers, ~25-fold in oligomers, and ~24-fold in fibrils. Similarly, L also prevented the rate of H2O2 generation significantly in all conformers. The amount of 7-OH-CCA can be correlated with the amount of OH• produced in the reaction mixture in a 1:1 ratio. In the presence of L, OH• formation was quenched in all of the conformers, by ~20-fold in AβM, ~94-fold in AβO-PBS, and ~41-fold in AβF-PBS. Control experiments with the peptide plus Asc did not generate any ROS (Fig. 2B blue, Fig. S4).

Oxidative modification of Aβ conformers:

The ROS generation by Cu-Aβ lead to oxidative modifications in the peptide. Several amino acids such as aspartate, histidine, tyrosine, and methionine are known to be oxidized, producing N-terminal truncated peptide, histidine-2-oxo, tyrosine radicals, and methionine sulfoxide, respectively.[33,58–62] Tyrosine radicals often form di-tyrosine linkages which are reported to be present in the cortical and hippocampus regions in AD patients at ~8-fold higher concentrations compared to a healthy brain. The di-tyrosine formation accelerates peptide aggregation and aggravates neurotoxicity.[63–65] The oxidation of Aβ was confirmed by the presence of +16 Da peaks in MALDI-MS (Fig. 3A). We find the +16 Da peaks are absent in the presence of L (Fig. 3B), which further supports the antioxidant and redox silencing properties of L.

To obtain further insight into the nature of oxidative modification, we performed LC-MS/MS studies and quantified the extent of oxidation in the absence and presence of L as well as to identify the specific oxidation sites. We find that in the presence of Asc, ~47% of Cu2+-Aβ42 monomers were oxidized (Fig. 4A). The highest amount of oxidation of 67% was observed in the oligomers, followed by the fibrils at ~57%. This observation is consistent with our ROS assays (Fig. 2). The amino acids Phe4, His6, Tyr10, His13, His14, Phe20, Leu34 are the sites where oxidation occurred via the net addition of one oxygen, as is common for radical-induced oxidation of these amino acids (Fig. 4B, Fig. S5–S8).[66–68] The oxidation of Leu34 most likely produces an alcohol. We also find that Met35 or Val36 are oxidized based on b and y ions (Fig. S7), with M35 being the more likely of the two due to its higher propensity for oxidation to the sulfoxide.[69] Furthermore, one residue between Gly25 and Ile31 is oxidized (Fig. S8). However, we could not obtain the exact identity of the residue in this stretch of sequence (GSNKGAI). We tested whether L could prevent the oxidative modification of Aβ42. Under identical conditions, L effectively reduced the level of peptide oxidation (Fig. 4A) in all conformers, corroborating with the ROS and MALDI data.

The binding of Cu2+ and Cu+ to Aβ is dynamic with fast ligand exchange.[70,71] Cu2+ mainly binds to the - NH2 of Asp1, the -C=O of Asp1-Ala2 backbone, and the N-atoms of His6 and His13 or His14 in an equatorial fashion at physiological pH.[47,72] Cu+ is proposed to bind in a linear fashion to His13 and His14 residues.[28] The difference in coordination spheres between the two redox states suggests a significant structural rearrangement during the electron transfer process.[73] An ‘in-between’ state existing in equilibrium with Cu+-Aβ and Cu2+-Aβ is considered to facilitate fast electron transfer via the POET mechanism.[32,33] Since efficient electron transfer and the extent of ROS production depends critically on the ‘in between’ state, the oxidative modification of Aβ may provide structural insight about the ‘inbetween state’.[33] In a previous study with Aβ28, Phe19 and Phe20 were found to be oxidized along with Asp1, His13, and His14.[33] His6 was not oxidized, indicating that His6 is not part of the coordination sphere of the ‘in-between’ state of catalytic amyloid beta responsible for ROS production. Time-dependent oxidation of Aβ40 has also been reported recently[74], which showed that Asp1, His13, His14, and Met35 are the primary oxidation sites. Initially, the Cu binding region was the primary oxidation target, but oxidation stopped after sometime. The C-terminal region continued to be oxidized, albeit to a lesser extent than the N-terminal region. In another report, a single binding mode for both the Cu+ and Cu2+ bound forms of Aβ were suggested based on a series of studies done on different sets of truncated and mutated versions of Aβ16.[75] In this report, a bidentate ligation via Asp1 carboxylate, the N-terminal amine, and one interchangeable His coordination (either His13 or His14) is suggested in the catalytic in-between state. In our study, Asp1 and Phe19 are not oxidized. However, His6 and Phe4 are oxidized along with Tyr10, His13, and His14. This suggests that in our model, His6, His13, and His14 are part of the coordination sphere of the ‘in-between’ state. It is to be expected that the exact coordination sphere of Cu for the ‘in-between’ state depends critically on whether the full-length Aβ42 peptide is studied vs the shorter peptides as the peptide length will certainly alter the folding of the peptide. The oxidation of Phe4, Tyr10, Phe20, Leu34, and Met35/Val36 suggest that ROS production by the primary coordination environment oxidizes residues in other parts of the protein as well. Aromatic amino acids are more susceptible to oxidation than aliphatic ones. Hence, the oxidation of branched chain amino acids like Leu34 is interesting, which can impact the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain.[76] The proximity of Tyr10 and Met35 by a ‘toxic’ turn at the 22 and 23 positions that results in the formation of an S-oxidized radical cation, which is stabilized by the hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids, is implicated to facilitate oligomer formation.[77] It is possible that the pro-oxidant nature of the oligomers is attributed to this stabilized ‘toxic’ structure. The oxidation of both Tyr10 and Met35 is indicative of the proximity of the two amino acids, while the C-terminal residues remain unoxidized and retain their hydrophobic nature, serving their purpose of stabilizing the oxidized intermediate. This stabilization is suggestive of the self-protecting property of the oligomers against further oxidative damage. Our identification of Leu34 (and likely Val36) is novel and not previously identified.

Pro-oxidant oligomers generate the highest amount of intracellular ROS:

Intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ aggregates causes neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial and DNA damage inside the neurons well before extracellular Aβ accumulation.[78,79] To investigate the intracellular ROS production by Aβ conformers, we performed the 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay in neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). DCFDA dye diffuses into the cells and is deacetylated by the cellular esterases into a non-fluorescent compound. Upon generation of ROS, this non-fluorescent intermediate is converted to 2’,7’–dichlorofluorescein (DCF) that fluoresces at 535 nm when excited at 485 nm. We measured the ROS generation by Aβ42 in the presence and absence of Cu2+ and L in SHY5Y cells. Additionally, the ROS generation was compared to the presence and absence of Asc.

In the absence of Asc, the ROS production is similar for the metal-free and metal-bound peptide (Fig. 5A, Table S2). In the presence of L, a ~9% reduction of ROS is observed with AβM alone. An even higher (~17%) reduction was observed in Cu2+-AβM with added L. The Cu2+-AβO-PBS samples (Fig. 5C, Table S2) showed an increase in ROS levels by ~20% compared to AβO-PBS alone. The ROS production also decreased in AβO-PBS samples when L was present. Cu2+-AβO-PBS with added L showed a significant decrease by ~18% in ROS compared to that of Cu2+-AβO-PBS alone.

The addition of Asc (Fig. 5B and 5D, Table S2) increased the ROS in Cu-bound forms of both monomers and oligomers compared to the metal-free forms (Fig. 5B, Table S2). In the presence of L, both Cu2+-AβM and Cu2+-AβO-PBS had lower ROS production compared to the corresponding Cu-bound forms in the absence of L. Under reducing conditions, the metal-free oligomers show a ~14% decrease in ROS with L compared to its absence. Together, we observe that the presence of the chelator reduces the overall ROS produced in cells. The ROS levels are reduced the most when both Cu and chelator are present along with the Aβ species. Cu2+-AβO-PBS behaved as pro-oxidants compared to AβO-PBS and AβM alone, similar to our in vitro assays. Thus, the chelator is capable of reducing the ROS generated by different species in cellulo. Table S2 summarizes the percent ROS generated by different species for different experiments with respect to the controls treated with DMSO.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Although oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases like AD is extensively studied, there are many aspects that are unknown. For example, how the oxidative stress impacts the amino acids in an amyloid protein, how these oxidized amino acids chelate the free metals and impact the reorganization energy of the ET processes for ROS production, and how the conformational changes in the oxidized proteins impact the overall aggregation pathway. Many reports mention that oxidized amino acids result in disintegration of fibrils and plaques. If that is the case, then by the principles of secondary nucleation, this can catalyze the formation of the pool of neurotoxic pro-oxidant amyloid oligomers. Fundamental studies are needed to attain insights in this regard so that potential therapeutics can be developed.

Our studies highlight the importance of pro-oxidant oligomers in ROS generation and subsequent downstream effects. A higher energy entatic state of Cu2+ bound AβO-PBS compared to AβM and AβF-PBS could lead to the elevated ROS production in the oligomers. The monomers, on the other hand, display an antioxidant role and could have a neuroprotectant function in the early stage of the disease. As the soluble and diffusible oligomeric pool accumulates, the prooxidant nature of this species exerts severe neurological damage. The insoluble nature of the fibrils and plaques are expected to affect the local environments as these species are likely immobile. The rationally designed Cu2+ chelator in this study effectively sequesters Cu2+ from Cu2+-Aβ42 and inhibits ROS formation in vitro and in cellulo. The chelator also inhibited oxidation of amino acids in Aβ42 as confirmed by mass spectrometry. As oxidized amino acids play an important role in aggregation and toxicity of different amyloid conformers, the ability to suppress ROS generation by suitably designed metal chelators that silence and scavenge the toxic radicals could pave the way for potential therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemicals:

All chemicals used for this study are analytical grade. Milli-Q water was used to prepare solutions whenever required. Phosphate buffer solution (20 mM) was chelexed overnight to remove trace metals. A CuCl2 (Alfa-Aesar) stock solution (10 mM) was prepared in the presence of 40 mM glycine (Sigma) to prevent the precipitation of copper phosphate. A coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (3-CCA; Acros Organics) stock solution (10 mm) was prepared in phosphate buffer (PB; 20 mm, pH 9.0) and stored at −20°C. Prior to use, 3-CCA was diluted with PB and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 using H3PO4. The stock solution of the chelator L (20 mM) was prepared in water. Amplex Red (Chemodex) stock (10 mM) in DMSO and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) stock (10 U/mL) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) were prepared and stored at −20°C. SH-SY5Y cells were a gift from Dr. Yu-Dong Zhou at the University of Mississippi.

Peptide synthesis and purification:

NH3+−Aβ42−COO− was synthesized at 0.1 mmol scale using Wang resin with preloaded Ala (CEM, loading 0.19 mmol/g) with a polystyrene backbone. The peptide synthesis and purification were performed as previously described.[50]

Preparation of peptide stocks:

The lyophilized pure Aβ42 (1 mM) was dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-ol (HFIP), transferred to centrifuge tubes, and kept inside a hood overnight with caps open. The peptides were again lyophilized overnight to obtain thin Aβ42 films and stored at −80 °C until use. Aβ42 monomer (1 mM) was prepared by dissolving the film in freshly prepared 10 mM NaOH, followed by vortexing for 10 s, sonicating for 10 min, and centrifuging for 3 min at 20000 g. The supernatant was transferred to ice and the concentration was determined by UV-vis spectroscopy (ε280 nm = 1490 M−1cm−1).

Preparation of oligomeric and fibrillar Forms:

Aβ42 oligomer (Aβ42O-PBS) was prepared at 25 μM concentration at room temperature by diluting the monomer in PBS pH 7.4, followed by centrifugation at 20000 g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was sonicated for 1 minute and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. Aβ42 fibril (Aβ42F-PBS) was prepared at 100 μM concentration by diluting the monomer in PBS followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 days with lateral shaking at 90 rpm. Although Scheme 1 shows that Cu2+ can be added either before or after aggregate formation, in this study Cu2+ has been added after the formation of the oligomers and fibrils.

Synthesis of L:

As summarized in Scheme S1, ligand precursor P1, 2,2’-(1-(6-bromopyridin-2-yl)ethane-1,1-diyl)dipyridine, was synthesized as previously described,[69] and subsequently converted to ligand precursor P2, 6-(1,1-di(pyridin-2-yl)ethyl)picolinonitrile, according to a published procedure.[80,81] The new carboxylic acid ligand, L, was prepared by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the picolinonitrile precursor (P2) using a modified literature procedure.[82] The picolinonitrile precursor (0.5 g, 1.746 mmol) was taken into a two-neck round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar and a reflux condenser. Hydrochloric acid (6 M, 5 mL) was added to the flask, and the flask was purged with N2 for 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was refluxed under a N2 atmosphere for 24 hours before it was allowed to cool to room temperature and transferred to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Acetonitrile (~100 mL) was added to the Erlenmeyer flask in portions while sonicating the solution in an ultrasonic bath. The desired product precipitated from the solution as a white solid during sonication. The solid was filtered, washed with acetonitrile, and dried in a vacuum oven to give pure product in 91% (0.485 g) yield. 1H NMR (Fig. S9) (500 MHz, D2O): δ 8.66 (d, J = 4.75 Hz, 2 H), 8.33 (t, J = 7.9 Hz, 2H), 8.17 (d, J = 7.75 Hz, 1H), 8.12 (t, J = 7.9 Hz, 1H), 7.82 (t, J = 5.75 Hz, 2 H), 7.76 (d, J = 8 Hz, 1H), 7.73 (d, J = 8.2 Hz, 2H), 2.42 (s, 3 H). 13C NMR (Fig. S10) (DMSO-d6, 126 MHz): δ 165.72, 162.28, 160.85, 147.47, 145.93, 141.36, 138.72, 126.58, 124.77, 123.87, 123.48, 58.06, 26.50. HR-ESI-MS (M+) m/z calc. for [L+H]+, 306.1243, found, 306.1249. Stock solutions of L were prepared in water prior to experiments.

Bcs assay:

Bcs assay was performed anaerobically using O2-free solutions in a septa-capped cuvette. A 2:1 ratio of L to Cu1+ was used to minimize free Cu1+ in solution. 30 μM L was mixed with 15 μM of Cu2+ followed by the addition of 3 mM Asc in 100 mM MOPS pH 7.4 to form the CuL complex. Bcs2− was then incrementally titrated into the CuL solution with continuous stirring for 10–15 min, to form [Cu(Bcs)2]3−, as indicated by an increase in absorbance at 483 nm (ε483= 13,300 M−1cm−1). The formation of [Cu(Bcs)2]3− was then plotted against the equivalents of Bcs2− or CuL to obtain the stoichiometry of Cu1+ to L. The plots of [Cu(Bcs)2]3− vs the ratio of total L and CuL (1/θ) were made to determine the binding affinity (Kd) of Cu1+ for the peptide according to equation (i): (i) Kd=[[L]t[CuL]]−1{([Bcs2−]t[Cu(Bcs)23−])−2}2[Cu(Bcs)23−]β2

where β2 = 1019.8 M−2 for [Cu(Bcs)2]3−.

Asc oxidation assay:

The kinetics of Asc oxidation was measured in a Cary 8454 UV spectrophotometer by following the decay of Asc peak at 265 nm. Solutions contained 5 μM of Aβ42, 4.5 μM CuCl2, and 100 μM Asc in 20 mM PBS. Samples with the chelator contained 45 μM of L. A blank spectrum was recorded for each sample before the addition of Asc followed by the kinetics measurement.

Amplex red assay:

Kinetics of H2O2 generation was measured by the amplex red assay in a Cary 8454 spectrophotometer using a 1 cm quartz cuvette. Amplex red, in the presence of HRP and H2O2, forms resorufin which absorbs strongly at 570 nm. To obtain the calibration curve, H2O2 solutions ranging from 0.1 μM to 60 μM were prepared. A combination of amplex red (50 μM), HRP (0.1 UmL−1), Asc (100 μM), and L (90 μM), representing sample conditions were added to H2O2 solutions and the absorbance was recorded. The slope of the calibration curve for each condition was obtained to account for the correct H2O2 amount generated by each sample (Fig. S11). This calibration is essential to account for any background signal from the added reagents, for example, Asc and L towards the yield for resorufin. Solutions for amplex red assay contained 5 μM of Aβ42, 4.5 μM CuCl2, 100 μM Asc, 50 μM amplex red, and 0.1 UmL−1 HRP in 20 mM PBS, pH 7.4. Samples with the chelator contained 45 μM of L. Experiments were done in triplicate and blank spectra were recorded for each sample prior to the addition of Asc.

Coumarin-3-carboxylic acid assay:

The kinetics of oxidation of 3-CCA to fluorescent 7-hydroxy-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (7-OH-CCA) (λex = 395 nm, λem = 450 nm) by OH• was monitored in a fluorescence cuvette of 1 cm path length on a PTI fluorimeter. The samples contained 10 μM peptide, 9 μM Cu2+, 100 μM 3-CCA, and 400 μM Asc in 20 mM PBS pH 7.4. Similar assays were performed with 90 μM of L. The OH• generation was initiated by adding Asc. Experiments were done in triplicate.

Calculation of initial rates:

The initial rates for H2O2 production and Asc oxidation were calculated from the first 300 s of the kinetic runs using ε570 nm = 33,740 M−1cm−1, and 33,770 M−1cm−1 for amplex samples containing Asc, and Asc+L, respectively (Fig. S11).

MALDI-TOF:

MALDI-TOF-MS measurements were done in a Bruker Voyager instrument using sinapinic acid matrix (Sigma, 10 mg/mL stock containing 1:1 ACN:H2O with 0.1% TFA). Oxidation reactions were initiated by adding 100 μM Asc to 10 μM Aβ42 and 9 μM Cu2+ in 20 mM PBS pH 7.4 in the absence and presence of 90 μM L. Reactions were quenched by 0.1% TFA after 5 min followed by denaturation with 4 M guanidinium hydrochloride (VWR). Samples were purified with C18 ziptips (Fisher) followed by eluting with α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix in 60% ACN, 0.1% TFA and directly spotted on the MALDI plate. A minimum allowable intensity laser was used.

LC-MS/MS:

Oxidation reactions were initiated by adding 100 μM Asc to 10 μM Aβ and 9 μM Cu2+ in 20 mM PB (pH 7.4) in the absence and presence of 90 μM L. Reactions were quenched by 0.1% TFA after 5 min.

LC-MS/MS analysis:

All samples were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 Nano UHPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using a 150 × 0.075 mm PepMap 100 C18, 2 μm particle size, analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in trapping mode with a C18 trap cartridge. The peptides were separated using mobile phase A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min. The peptide separation gradient consisted of 2 to 30% solvent B over 4 min, ramped to 95% solvent B over 2 min, held for 4 min, and then returned to 2% solvent B over 1 min and held for 6 min. Peptides were eluted directly into the nanospray source of an Orbitrap Fusion instrument controlled with Xcalibur version 3.1 (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) using a conductive nanospray emitter. The spray voltage was set to 2400 V and ion transfer tube was set to 300 °C. The MS1 data were collected at a resolution of 60000 with the scan range of 250–2000 m/z. In CID mode, full MS scans were followed by eight subsequent MS/MS scans on the top eight most abundant peptide ions. Collision energy was set to 35%.

Data analysis:

The percent oxidation of the peptide was calculated by summing the area of the selected ion chromatogram peaks of all of the oxidized peptide peaks and then divided by the sum of the area of the unoxidized plus oxidized peptides. CID MS/MS fragmentation was used to identify the major sites of oxidation within the peptide obtained after trypsin digestion. The presence or absence of unoxidized or oxidized b and y ions were used to identify the site of oxidation.

DCFDA Assay:

SH-SY5Y cells maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium, EMEM (ATCC): F12 (GIBCO) (1:1), 10% FBS (GIBCO), and 1% Penstrep (GIBCO) were grown to a confluence of 70–80% at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. DCFDA (2,7-di-chlorofluorescein diacetate) (Biotitum) was used to detect ROS in cells. In a 96 well pate, 100 μL of 25000 cells were plated. After 24 hours, cells were incubated with different Aβ conformers (5 μM) with or without CuCl2 (4.5 eq) and L (10 eq in 0.5% DMSO) in fresh media. DMSO was needed to avoid solubility issues of L under assay conditions. The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DCFDA in serum-free media for 30 minutes. Cells were again washed with PBS and supplemented with serum-free media. The fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation and emission wavelengths at 485 and 535 nm, respectively. In another set of experiments, cells were tested for the effect of Asc on the level of ROS production. These cells, after washing with PBS, were incubated with 10 eq Asc in serum-free media for 30 minutes and the fluorescence intensity was measured. The % ROS production has been measured in comparison to the cells incubated with the Aβ conformers in DMSO. Control experiments show that treating the cells with Aβ increases ROS production compared to the untreated cells (Fig. S12).
