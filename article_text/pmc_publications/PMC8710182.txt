Objectives:

To examine how mental illness (MI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) were associated with whether skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents returned to and remained in the community and if receipt of home health services was associated with post-SNF home time.

Design:

Retrospective cohort study based on secondary data analyses.

Setting:

New York State Medicare beneficiaries who were admitted to an SNF in 2014.

Participants:

46,137 older adults admitted to SNFs and 25,357 discharged from SNFs to home.

Measurements:

We used Medicare claims and assessment databases to derive our outcomes (discharge to the community and home time [i.e., days alive in the community]), determine MI/ADRD status, and obtain socio-demographic and clinical characteristics.

Results:

Among SNF admissions, 22.9% had MI, 22.6% had ADRD, and 59.0% were discharged to the community. In analyses adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, MI and ADRD were associated with decreased odds of community discharge and less home time during 90 days of follow-up. However, when we included depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and daily functioning in the analyses, these associations were attenuated. Receipt of post-SNF home health services was associated with increased home time among those with MI or ADRD.

Conclusions:

Newly admitted SNF residents with MI or ADRD were less likely to be discharged and, if discharged, spent less time in the community. Interventions targeting depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functioning and improving linkage with home health services may help decrease differences in post-acute care trajectories between those with and without MI and ADRD.

pmcOBJECTIVE

Older adults with mental illness (MI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) comprise vulnerable populations that have high levels of SNF utilization.1, 2 Among older adults admitted to SNFs for post-acute care and rehabilitation, approximately 28.6% have MI, 11.4% have ADRD, and 13.4% are diagnosed with both MI and ADRD.3 Newly admitted SNF residents with MI and ADRD are especially at risk for transitioning to nursing home long-term care.4 Even among older adults discharged from the SNF, many struggle with the SNF-to-community transition.5, 6 Of concern is that those with MI and ADRD have an increased risk for poor discharge outcomes (e.g., hospital and SNF readmissions).6–9

Although MI, ADRD, and the behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPS) associated with dementia are risk factors for long-term care placement10 and high utilization of services,7, 9 we know less about how MI and ADRD affect the SNF-to-home trajectory. Given that the psychiatric symptoms of MI often are severe enough to cause functional impairment and that the cognitive deficits of dementia must “interfere with independence in everyday activities,”11 some SNF residents with MI and ADRD likely have difficulty participating fully in rehabilitation. Most older adults with ADRD also have BPS such as apathy, depression, and agitation12 that can negatively affect functioning. This is concerning for the SNF rehabilitation setting because depression can negatively impact rehabilitation participation, outcomes, and treatment adherence,13 resulting in longer length of stays,14 less functional improvement,14 and increased mortality.15 Even though MI and ADRD are chronic illnesses, their associated psychiatric symptoms and behaviors can be treated, which subsequently can improve functioning. Therefore, better understanding the role that psychiatric symptoms, behaviors, and functional impairment have in mediating the association of MI and ADRD with SNF-to-home discharge outcomes will help: 1) clarify why people with MI and ADRD may fare more poorly in the SNF-to-home transition, 2) characterize the impact of these factors on post-acute care and rehabilitation, and 3) identify intervention targets to help older adults with MI and ADRD return to and remain in the community.

To evaluate a person’s ability to return to and remain in the community, there is an emerging patient-centered outcome, “home time,” which is well-aligned with the priority of many patients and families to spend more time at home.16 Home time captures this priority to spend time at home because it considers the number of days a person was alive and not in a hospital, inpatient rehabilitation facility, or SNF over a follow-up period.17, 18 Home time thereby encompasses and adds depth to more traditional binary measures such as readmissions and mortality. To our knowledge, no studies have examined home time specifically in older adults with MI and ADRD following the transition from post-acute SNF care to the community.

For many, the post-acute care rehabilitation process does not terminate in the SNF but continues even after they return to the community with most SNF patients receiving home health agency (HHA) services following discharge.5 HHAs provide a wide range of skilled services (e.g., nursing, rehabilitation therapy),19 which serve a critical role in helping patients transition to and remain at home. Emerging evidence suggests that being linked to HHA services may improve post-acute SNF discharge outcomes,8 and increasing HHA intensity may decrease risk of unplanned admissions.20 However, we do not know how post-SNF receipt of HHA services may differentially affect subgroups, such as those with MI or ADRD. Given that these populations are at elevated risk for functional impairment and poor outcomes, the benefit they receive from HHA services may differ from older adults without MI and ADRD. If HHA services are especially beneficial to those with MI and ADRD, then this knowledge could help inform SNF discharge planning and care transition interventions for these vulnerable populations.

Our study objective was to examine how MI and ADRD were associated with whether newly admitted SNF residents were discharged to and remained in the community (“home time”) and how depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functional impairment mediated this association. Another objective was to examine how receipt of HHA services was associated with post-SNF home time. We hypothesized that the association between MI and ADRD status with SNF discharge to the community and home time was at least partially mediated by the presence of depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functional impairment (as shown in Figure 1). Compared to older adults without MI or ADRD, we also hypothesized that receipt of HHA services had a larger impact on home time among those with MI or ADRD.

METHODS

Population

Our study examined New York State (NYS) fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with an index NYS SNF admission in 2014 following a hospitalization of three or more days. To address our research objectives, we considered two cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 46,137 post-acute care patients with an index SNF admission that occurred between 1/1/2014–9/23/2014 to allow for a 100-day follow-up period in 2014 (100 days mark when Medicare no longer pays for post-acute SNF care19 and SNF residents become long-stay residents). The second cohort consisted of 25,357 older adults who were discharged from their SNF index stay to the community between 1/1/2014–10/2/2014 to allow for a 90-day post-SNF discharge follow-up period in 2014. We entered into a data use agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and purchased the following Medicare administrative databases from 2014: Medicare Provider Analysis and Review File (MedPAR),21 Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF),21 Medicare Outpatient Revenue Center File,21 Physician Part B file,21 HHA claims data,21 and Long-Term Care Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS), which is a standardized assessment of SNF residents administered by SNF staff.21, 22 We also used data from the CMS FY 2014 Final Rule Tables,23 Area Health Resources File (AHRF),24 and the Nursing Home Compare (NHC) file managed by CMS25 (see Supplemental Table 1 for covariates and corresponding databases). Medicare administrative databases are based on reimbursements for Medicare services for all US Medicare beneficiaries as well as mandated assessments (Supplemental Table 2 has additional descriptions on Medicare databases and the United States healthcare system). The University of Rochester’s Institutional Review Board approved this study.

Outcomes

We had two outcomes. The first outcome was whether a post-acute care SNF patient was discharged to the community within 100 days of SNF admission (binary: yes/no). Included in the “no” category were older adults who were discharged from the SNF to a hospital or a different SNF, remained in the SNF longer than 100 days, or died. Among post-acute care SNF patients discharged to the community, the second outcome was home time (continuous: number of days) in the 90 days following SNF discharge. We assessed home time using MedPAR, MBSF, and outpatient revenue center files by calculating the number of days an older adult was alive and not in an institutional setting such as a hospital, an inpatient rehabilitation setting, or an SNF, which was similar to previous studies.17

Key Independent Variable

The key independent variable was the presence of a MI or ADRD diagnosis. Similar to our prior work,3 to determine whether MI or ADRD diagnoses were present, we examined Section I (active diagnoses) of the SNF admission MDS for prepopulated fields and ICD-9 codes indicating the presence of a MI or ADRD (Supplemental Table 3 shows how diagnoses were determined). MI encompassed schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psychosis as well as bipolar, depression, anxiety, personality, and substance use disorders. We categorized our cohort into three groupings: 1) MI present and ADRD absent, 2) ADRD present (with and without MI), and 3) both MI and ADRD absent (served as the reference group). We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine ADRD without MI and ADRD with MI – these groups had very similar outcomes, however, and we thereby combined them into the ADRD with and without MI grouping, referred to hereafter as ADRD.

Covariates

Individual-level covariates included age, sex (female or male), race (white or non-white), marital status (married or not), and Medicaid dual eligibility (dual or not) as well as number of medical conditions, hospital admitting diagnosis, and the reason for the pre-SNF hospitalization (medical or surgical reason; CMS FY 2014 Final Rule Tables).

SNF-level factors may affect discharge outcomes,26 and we included facility ownership (profit or non-profit/government-owned), occupancy, registered nurse (RN)/total nursing hours per resident day, SNF 5-star overall quality rating (NHC file) as well as metro vs. non-metro county (determined by Rural Urban Commuting Codes) and the supply of primary care physicians, hospital beds, SNF beds, and HHAs per 100,000 people (AHRF) in the SNF county.

We used the SNF admission MDS assessment to determine depressive symptoms as assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score (0–27; higher scores indicated more severe depression)27; the presence of aggressive behaviors as characterized by the Aggressive Behavior Scale (ABS) that was based on four MDS items (e.g., hitting or kicking, screaming at others, other behaviors such as throwing food, rejection of care); and daily functioning as determined by activities of daily living (ADL) scores (0–28; higher scores indicated worse functional status)28, 29 The MDS PHQ-9 assessment included an observational version based on SNF staff observations of residents who could not self-report (PHQ-9 OV), which performed well in residents with severe cognitive impairment.30 ABS was scored from 0–12 and had the following groupings: none (0), mild (1–2), moderate (3–5) and severe (6–12).31, 32

HHA services use considered whether an older adult received services from a Medicare-certified HHA (e.g., medical social workers, skilled nursing, home health aide, and occupational, physical, and speech therapy services) within seven days of discharge from the SNF (binary variable: yes, no).

Statistical Analyses

First, we conducted bivariate analyses (chi-square and analysis of variance for statistical inference as appropriate) to examine whether MI and ADRD status, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, behavioral and psychological symptoms, and SNF-level covariates, differed by discharge home status. Second, to examine community discharge among our SNF admission cohort, we conducted bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with community discharge (yes/no) as our outcome and the presence of MI or ADRD as our primary independent variable. In a sequential model-building approach, we added: 1) socio-demographic and clinical factors, 2) depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and daily functioning, and 3) SNF characteristics. Third, to examine home time among our SNF discharge cohort, we performed bivariate and multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression models33 with home time as our outcome and the presence of MI or ADRD as our primary independent variable. Similar to the logistic regression analyses, in a sequential model-building approach, we added: 1) socio-demographic and clinical factors as well as receipt of HHA services, 2) depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and daily functioning, and 3) SNF characteristics. We also conducted bivariate and multivariate stratified analyses to examine whether the association of depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, daily functioning, and HHA services use with community discharge and home time varied across MI and ADRD groupings. Missing data were present in about 5% of our cohorts and, for missing data in the multivariate analyses, we used list-wise deletion. We conducted analyses at the beneficiary level using SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and STATA (version 12.1, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

RESULTS

Sample Characteristics

Among the cohort of 46,137 NYS Medicare beneficiaries admitted to an SNF, 22.9% had MI, 22.6% had ADRD (with or without MI), and 52.8% had no MI or ADRD. Compared to those not discharged home, older adults discharged home were less likely to have MI or ADRD and more likely to have a surgical hospitalization and to be younger, female, Caucasian, and married. They also had less severe depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functional impairment, and were less likely to be dual Medicare and Medicaid eligible (Table 1). Moreover, older adults discharged home were more likely to have been residents of higher quality and non-profit SNFs. In the 90 days following SNF discharge, 6.1% (N=1,542) of our discharged cohort died, 25.4% (N=6,434) were rehospitalized, and 11.8% (N=2,993) were readmitted to an SNF.

SNF-to-Community Discharge

We next conducted logistic regression analyses with discharge to the community as our outcome and older adults with neither MI nor ADRD serving as the reference group for the primary independent variable (Table 2). In unadjusted logistic regression analyses, MI and ADRD were associated with 13% and 60% decreased odds of community discharge. After adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, MI and ADRD were associated with 9% and 49% decreased odds of community discharge. When depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and daily functioning were added to the regression models, however, MI was no longer associated with community discharge and ADRD’s association was attenuated (30% decreased odds of community discharge). In the fully adjusted model, more severe depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functional impairment were associated with decreased odds of community discharge.

Home Time Following SNF Discharge

Among the cohort of 25,357 older adults who were discharged from the SNF to home, we conducted ZINB regression analyses with home time as our outcome and older adults without MI and ADRD serving as the reference group for the primary independent variable (Table 3). In unadjusted ZINB regression analyses, MI and ADRD were associated with 1.22 (Z: 3.59; p&lt;0.01) and 3.64 (Z: 7.73; p&lt;0.01) fewer days in the community post-SNF discharge over a 90-day follow-up period. After adjusting for socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and receipt of HHA services, MI and ADRD were associated with 1.17 (Z: 3.37; p&lt;0.01) and 1.49 (Z: 3.59; p&lt;0.01) fewer days in the community. In the fully adjusted model with depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and daily functioning, MI’s association with home time persisted, but ADRD was no longer associated with home time. In this fully adjusted model, more severe depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functional impairment were associated with less home time whereas receipt of HHA services was associated with increased home time.

Stratified Analyses

In stratified multivariate analyses examining community discharge, the strength of the associations of depressive symptoms and daily functioning with community discharge had no or minor clinically meaningful differences across MI/ADRD groupings (Table 4). In stratified multivariate analyses examining home time, functional impairment had a larger effect among older adults with ADRD compared to those with neither MI nor ADRD (home time decreased by 0.85 vs 0.50 days; Z: 3.59, p-value&lt;0.01) (Table 5). Additionally, receipt of HHA services post-SNF discharge was associated with a larger benefit among older adults with ADRD than those with neither MI nor ADRD (home time increased by 6.95 vs. 3.16 days; Z: 3.25, p-value&lt;0.01).

DISCUSSION

We found that SNF patients with MI or ADRD, compared to those without, had worse outcomes - they were less likely to be discharged home and had less home time. These findings were consistent with prior literature6–9 and our hypothesis. Although the change in home time point estimates (1.22 and 3.64 fewer days over 90 days) seems modest, given the physical, emotional, and/or financial costs that can be associated with even a single day in the hospital or nursing home, many patients and their families may find these reductions meaningful. Also, even a small reduction in inpatient and SNF services can be consequential when considering the impact at a national level for a large population. When we accounted for depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functional impairment that can result from MI and ADRD, the association of MI and ADRD with community discharge and home time was considerably attenuated. Indeed, in the fully adjusted models, MI status was no longer associated with community discharge and ADRD status was no longer associated with home time. Our findings thereby suggest that much of the association of MI and ADRD with post-acute care SNF trajectories was mediated by psychiatric symptoms, behaviors, and functional impairment. Additionally, among those with MI and ADRD, functional impairment and depressive symptoms were associated with a reduced likelihood of community discharge and less home time. Aggressive behaviors also were associated with a reduced likelihood of community discharge in these subgroups, but not with home time (wide CIs indicate possible power limitations in these subanalyses). Even though MI can be a chronic condition requiring long-term treatment and ADRD represents a progressive neurological condition, these findings suggest that interventions that targeting psychiatric symptoms, behaviors, and functional impairment in those with MI and ADRD nonetheless may help improve care transition outcomes.

Receipt of HHA services was associated with increased home time among our three groups of older adults. Partially consistent with our hypothesis, receipt of HHA services more than doubled the impact on home time among those with ADRD compared to those with neither MI nor ADRD. This finding suggests that HHA services may play a critical role in helping older adults transition to and remain at home, especially for those with ADRD. As HHAs can provide a wide range of skilled services including skilled nursing, medical social work, home health aide, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy services,19 it is unclear which of these services may be most beneficial to those with MI and ADRD (e.g., is it the focus on daily functioning, management of medical comorbidities, caregiver support, and/or something else?). Among a national sample of Medicare HHA patients, functional disability and depressed mood were associated with an increased risk of hospitalization,34 further evidence that depressive symptoms and functional impairment that can result from MI and ADRD likely contribute to worse SNF discharge outcomes. Moreover, older adults who received rehabilitation services have an elevated risk for depressive symptoms.35 A depression care management intervention for home health recipients was found to reduce hospitalization and rehospitalization among older adults,36 more evidence that linkage to HHA services may be particularly salient for those with MI and ADRD transitioning from the SNF to home. Further investigation of how the type, dose, and quality of HHA services may impact discharge outcomes among those with MI and ADRD is needed.

Our study had some notable strengths. First, we relied upon a dataset that consisted of a large cohort of older adult Medicare beneficiaries from NYS that enabled us to account for many individual and facility-level characteristics that may have affected the association of MI and ADRD with our outcomes. Second, we combined a wide variety of datasets to examine acute care, SNF, and home health care services, which allowed us to examine a post-hospital episode of care and the mediating role of key covariates with community discharge and home time.

Our study also had several limitations. First, we relied upon Medicare claims datasets, which may have issues with data validity as they are collected for reimbursement rather than research purposes. In particular, the sensitivity of the MDS PHQ-9 assessment for identifying depression is low (although its specificity is relatively high).37 Moreover, ADRD is often underdiagnosed in Medicare claims databases, as the sensitivity of claims-identified dementia is only 0.51 (specificity is 0.92) and the severity of cognitive and functional deficits likely influenced whether dementia was diagnosed.38 Consequently, this combination of issues may have biased our findings towards the null hypothesis. Second, while we accounted for many individual and facility-level covariates, we did not have information on other psychiatric symptoms and behaviors, in-home services, and social determinants (e.g., socioeconomic status) that could have impacted discharge outcomes. Third, our datasets were limited to NYS, and home and community-based services and other supports (e.g., Medicaid availability can vary across states) may impact SNF discharge outcomes and the generalizability of our findings. Future efforts should consider examining these services in a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Fourth, our datasets are from 2014 and the association between MI and ADRD status with discharge outcomes may have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

CONCLUSIONS

Among newly admitted SNF residents, those with MI and ADRD had worse SNF discharge outcomes, which were mediated (at least in part) by more severe depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functioning that can result from these illnesses. Consequently, interventions that target these psychiatric symptoms, behaviors, and impaired functioning might improve community discharge and home time outcomes. Although innovative care models have been developed (e.g., embedding depression care management in HHAs36 and a videoconferencing-based intervention for homebound older adults that reduced depression and disability39), geriatric mental healthcare is still “prejudiced by models of care that have evolved for chronic treatment in outpatient settings” and “our treatments and models of mental healthcare do not fit our neediest population.”40 As MI and ADRD are highly prevalent in acute and postacute settings, much more work is needed to integrate mental health treatment in these settings, which in turn could improve discharge outcomes. Of interest, receipt of HHA services had a powerful impact among those with ADRD, which suggests that HHA services may play an important role in helping this vulnerable population successfully transition back to the community. Future work is needed to examine how the type and timing of HHA services affect discharge outcomes as well as to identify barriers to receiving HHA services after SNF discharge. Additionally, that newly admitted non-White, Medicare-Medicaid dual eligible SNF residents from lower quality-rated for-profit SNFs were less likely to be discharged to the community is concerning and warrants further consideration.

Highlights

This study’s objectives were to examine how mental illness (MI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) were associated with whether skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents returned to and remained in the community and if receipt of home health services was associated with post-SNF home time.

Older adults with MI or ADRD admitted to SNFs were less likely to have a community discharge and, if discharged, spent less time in the community; these associations were mediated in large part by depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and daily functioning. Receipt of post-SNF home health services was associated with increased home time among those with MI or ADRD.

Care transition interventions targeting depressive symptoms, aggressive behaviors, and functioning and improving linkage with home health services may help decrease differences in post-acute care trajectories between those with and without MI and ADRD.
