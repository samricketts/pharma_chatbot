Fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm with increased nighttime awakenings and more daytime naps is correlated with the risk of development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To explore whether a causal relationship underlies this correlation, the present study tested the hypothesis that chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm stimulates brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels and neuroinflammation in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. Female 3xTg-AD mice were allowed to sleep undisturbed or were subjected to chronic sleep fragmentation consisting of four daily sessions of enforced wakefulness (one hour each) evenly distributed during the light phase, five days a week for four weeks. Piezoelectric sleep recording revealed that sleep fragmentation altered the daily sleep-wake rhythm to resemble the pattern observed in AD. Levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ40 and Aβ42) determined by ELISA were higher in hippocampal tissue collected from sleep-fragmented mice than from undisturbed controls. In contrast, hippocampal levels of tau and phospho-tau differed minimally between sleep fragmented and undisturbed control mice. Sleep fragmentation also stimulated neuroinflammation as shown by increased expression of markers of microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokines measured by q-RT-PCR analysis of hippocampal samples. No significant effects of sleep fragmentation on Aβ, tau, or neuroinflammation were observed in the cerebral cortex. These studies support the concept that improving sleep consolidation in individuals at risk for AD may be beneficial for slowing the onset or progression of this devastating neurodegenerative disease.


pmcINTRODUCTION

High quality sleep is essential for healthy brain function, but far too many people fall short of attaining this basic physiological necessity. There are many causes of sleep disruption. Environmental disrupters of sleep include work schedules, lifestyle choices, noise and light pollution, or young children. Changes in the body – such as pain, restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea, or altered neural control of sleep – also disrupt sleep patterns. While many take the loss of sleep lightly—or even treat it as a matter of pride—sleep loss may have serious consequences for brain health. Indeed, growing evidence suggests that too little high-quality sleep could be a modifiable accelerator of neuropathological changes culminating in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Spira et al., 2013;Bubu et al., 2017).

Sleep disruption affects 25-40% of people with AD (Prinz et al., 1982;Bliwise, 2004;Bliwise et al., 2011). A decade or more before overt cognitive impairments, there are signs of sleep disruption (Vitiello and Borson, 2001). The types of sleep disruptions include: 1) reduced total sleep, 2) loss of deep sleep (i.e., slow-wave sleep), and 3) fragmentation of sleep (Tranah et al., 2011;Guarnieri et al., 2012;Guarnieri and Sorbi, 2015). Sleep fragmentation refers to frequent awakenings during the noctural sleeping period, such that continuous sleep is interruped. This contrasts with sleep restriction, in which a late bedtime and/or early wake time limits the duration of consolidated sleep. Both of these conditions may decrease total sleep. The importance of sleep fragmentation has been highlighted by findings that older adults with this condition have an accelerated rate of cognitive decline as well as increased risk of development of AD including expression of preclinical AD-like neuropathology (Tranah, et al, 2011;Lim et al., 2013;Musiek et al., 2018;Rogers-Soeder et al., 2018;Li et al., 2020). In both people and rodents, those with shorter sleep duration or lower sleep quality have higher levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ) (Kang et al., 2009;Spira, et al., 2013;Xie et al., 2013), and tau (Holth et al., 2019) in the brain, further suggesting a causal link to AD.

In rodents and humans, sleep deprivation or sleep fragmentation impairs performance on various cognitive measures (Tartar et al., 2006;Walker and Stickgold, 2006;Cai et al., 2009;Chen et al., 2009;Ward et al., 2009). Also, in rodents, sleep deprivation inhibits learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance (Tononi, 2009;Vyazovskiy and Faraguna, 2015) and stimulates neuroinflammation (Ramesh et al., 2012;Zielinski et al., 2014;Kincheski et al., 2017).

Despite the mounting evidence, knowledge gaps in the correlative associations between sleep and AD remain. A significant gap in knowledge concerns the role of sleep fragmentation in AD. Although the loss of sleep worsens neuropathology in AD-relevant mouse models (Kang, et al., 2009;Roh et al., 2012), the role of chronic daily sleep fragmentation in these models is untested. Sleep fragmentation may be a more superior model of AD-associated sleep disruption than the conventional approaches of sleep deprivation or sleep restriction, because sleep fragmentation is correlated with the risk of developing AD, conversion from MCI to AD, and the neuropathological progression of AD (Tranah et al, 2011; Lim et al, 2013; Musiek 2018)(Rogers-Soeder, et al., 2018;Li, et al., 2020). Based on these reports, we tested the hypothesis that chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm in an AD-relevant mouse model exacerbates the expression of Aβ and tau pathology, as well as neuroinflammation.

The 3xTg-AD mouse model, which expresses the PS1m146v, APPSwe, and tauP301L transgenes, was used. These mice exhibit age-dependent increases in amyloid plaque and tangle pathology in the hippocampus and neocortex (Oddo et al., 2003). In addition to AD-like neuropathology, 3xTg-AD mice show synaptic dysfunction and AD-related cognitive impairments, such as deficits in spatial working memory, which become more severe with age (Oddo, et al., 2003;Billings et al., 2005;Clinton et al., 2007). As compared to wild-type controls, 3xTg-AD mice do not exhibit any significant changes in sleep parameters or sleep architecture based on polysomnography studies (Kent et al., 2018).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Experimental animals and housing conditions

This study used only female 3xTg-AD mice, because the male 3xTg-AD mice have an inconsistent phenotype (https://www.jax.org/strain/004807). The founder mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory, and mice for this study were generated by an in-house breeding colony. Experimental mice were bred exclusively from homozygous x homozygous crosses from these founders. During experimentation, the mice were continuously exposed to an alternating light-dark cycle with lights on from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM and were provided with food and water ad libitum. The mice were housed four per cage, except during sleep monitoring or sleep fragmentation, when they were singly housed, as described below. The study used 32 mice and was performed in two separate cohorts (n=16 each) of two different ages, eight and eleven months old. Group sizes were based on past experience with this and related mouse lines, as well as general standards for AD mouse studies, as our SF approach was entirely novel.

Experimental design

All procedures were conducted in accordance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care Guide and were pre-approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. In each experiment, the mice were randomly assigned to receive either undisturbed sleep or sleep fragmentation. The goal was to mimic the frequent night-time awakenings and reduced sleep consolidation that are correlated with the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in humans (Tranah et al, 2011; Lim et al, 2013; Musiek 2018; Rogers-Soeder, et al., 2018; Li, et al., 2020). Two procedures for inducing sleep fragmentation in rodents have been published, i.e., continuous exposure to a novel stressor based on water aversion (Miyazaki et al., 2013;Minakawa et al., 2017) and an automated method with a bar sweeping immediately above the cage floor at 2-minute intervals forcing movement (Ramesh, 2009; Ramesh et al, 2012; Poroyko et al., 2016). The latter method has been used to mimic chronic obstructive sleep apnea, a common condition in AD patients (Bubu et al., 2020). However, neither of these methods are conditions that humans would experience. Instead, it seems likely that environmental stimuli and distractions may induce arousal and attention, thus promoting wakefulness in elderly nondemented patients. Therefore, an alternative approach with chronic exposure to novel stimuli was used. The mice in the sleep fragmentation group were exposed to one-hour-long periods of enforced wakefulness, four times/day, beginning at 9:00 AM, then again at 11:30 AM, 2:00 PM, &amp; 4:30 PM. The enforced wakefulness was induced by the periodic addition of novel objects (LEGO toys and cardboard tubes) to the cage and by gently touching the mice with a paintbrush if they appeared very sleepy. In contrast to the published methods of sleep fragmentation listed above, in which polysomnography was conducted in order to monitor specific sleep stages, the current study used piezoelectric recordings (described below). Although sleep stages could not be determined, the piezoelectric recordings allowed the continuous monitoring of daily sleep-wake rhythms for a week and is similar to human studies in which rest-activity rhythms were monitored by actigraphy without polysomnography (Tranah et al, 2011; Lim et al, 2013; Musiek et al, 2018). As described above, these human studies identified sleep fragmentation per se as a risk factor for AD. In our mouse studies, the daily sleep fragmentation protocol was repeated five days/week, for four weeks. These temporal parameters were selected based on previous reports that sleep restriction or sleep fragmentation for 3-5 days/week for 27-30 days deleteriously affects AD-like neuropathology or neuroinflammation (Zhu et al, 2016; Minakawa et al, 2017; Kincheski et al, 2017).

During weeks 1 and 4, all mice were housed in individual cages so that sleep could be monitored continuously, as described below. During weeks 2 and 3, mice were group-housed (four per cage), but the mice in the sleep fragmentation group were transferred to individual novel cages for their one-hour long enforced wakefulness sessions.

After four weeks of sleep fragmentation or undisturbed sleep, the mice were euthanized between 5:30 and 7:30 PM by CO2 asphyxiation followed by decapitation, according to American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines. The brains were dissected and each hippocampus and cortex subdivided into right and left halves that were frozen on crushed dry ice and then stored at −80°C. As indicated above, this experimental design was repeated on two cohorts of mice of different ages: cohort 1 (8 months old; n=8 each for the undisturbed sleep and sleep fragmented groups) and cohort 2 (11 months old; n=8 each for the undisturbed sleep and sleep fragmented groups). For each experiment, one half of each brain region was assayed for Aβ and tau. The other half was assayed for expression of neuroinflammatory markers.

Sleep monitoring

Sleep and wake were monitored with a piezoelectric system (Signal Solutions; www.sigsoln.com) (Donohue et al., 2008). The sleep monitoring cages use piezoelectric films to detect pressure changes induced by movement, including small respiratory movements during sleep, as described in previous studies (Duncan et al., 2012;Sethi et al., 2015). Based on EEG and human observations, the piezoelectric system has a sleep-wake classification accuracy of &gt;90% (Donohue, et al., 2008;Mang et al., 2014;Yaghouby et al., 2016). The sleep parameters studied include: (1) average total sleep percent over 24 hours; (2) average sleep percent at night; (3) average sleep percent during the day; (4) average sleep bout length over 24 hours; (5) average sleep bout length at night; and (6) average sleep bout length during the day. Durations of consecutive sleep states were used to compute mean sleep bout lengths, as reported previously (Duncan, et al., 2012;Sethi, et al., 2015). To eliminate the impact of short and ambiguous arousals on the bout length statistic, a bout is defined as an uninterrupted sequence of 30-second intervals, each containing greater than 50% sleep.

Immunoassays (ELISAs)

Amyloid-β (Aβ) solubility was determined in soluble fractions from, (1) 0.2% diethylamine (DEA), (2) radioimmuniprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA), and (3) 70% formic acid (FA), using sequential isolation conditions, respectively, as previously described (Murphy et al, 2007; Niedowicz et al, 2013; 2014). Aβ was quantified with a sandwich ELISA, as previously described (Murphy et al, 2007; Niedowicz et al, 2013; 2014). Aβ40 and Aβ42 were measured in the DEA and RIPA fractions using commercially available kits (Invitrogen, KHB3481 and KHB3544, respectively), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To detect total Aβ in the FA fraction, capture antibody Ab42.5 (against Aβ1-16; 0.5 μg / well) was used, followed by detection antibody: 0.25 μg/mL of biotinylated 4G8 (against Aβ17-24; BioLegend, San Diego, CA), as we had not previously tested the commercial kits using FA. Aβ levels were normalized to total protein concentrations loaded per well, as determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Phosphorylated tau pT181 (KHO0631) and total tau (KHB0041) was measured in the RIPA fraction (Invitrogen). Personnel performing the assays were blinded to mouse treatment condition.

Analysis of neuroinflammation

RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini-columns on dissected hippocampus and neocortical tissues stored at −80°C. cDNA was made using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, catalog #4368814) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan® Array Micro Fluidic Cards (Applied Biosystems, catalog no. 4342253) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a QuantStudio™ 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) were used: C1qa-Mm00432142_m1, C1qb-Mm01179619_m1, C1qc-Mm00776126_m1, C3-Mm01232779_m1, Il1b-Mm00434228_m1, Il6-Mm00446190_m1, Igf1-Mm00439560_m1, Tgfb1-Mm01178820_m1, Ccl3-Mm00441259_g1, Ccl4-Mm00443111_m1, Ccl6-Mm01302419_m1, Cxcl10-Mm00445235_m1, Cd68-Mm03047343_m1, Clec7a-Mm01183349_m1, Cst7-Mm00438351_m1, Itgax-Mm00498701_m1, Gfap-Mm01253033_m1, Lcn2-Mm01324470_m1, Ptx3-Mm00477268_m1, and S100b-Mm00485897_m1. Relative gene expression was calculated by the 2−ΔΔCT method. Hprt-Mm03024075_m1 was used as the normalizing gene. HPRT was selected as the normalizing gene after determining that it was most stably expressed in injury and diseases mouse brain tissue using the TaqMan Mouse Endogenous Control panel of 16 standard housekeeping genes (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat no. 4378702). Personnel blinded to the experimental conditions performed all quantifications.

Statistics

Sleep measures were compared between treatment groups and time (averaged for each half hour of the day) using a two-way ANOVA. Composite neuroinflammatory markers scores were analyzed using a standard least squares model, including age of mice, treatment group, and the interaction, using JMP Pro (version 14.0.0). Aβ and tau analyses were conducted in SPSS (version 27.0). A correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Holm-Bonferroni procedure (Holm, 1979). All models used were fixed effects. Data for sleep measures, Aβ and tau analyses, and neuroinflammatory markers were confirmed to be approximately normal using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests, and the equality of error variances were confirmed with Levene’s test. Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism (version 9.0.1).

RESULTS

Effects of sleep fragmentation on the daily sleep-wake rhythm

The sleep fragmentation protocol altered the daily distribution of sleep, while its effect on total 24-hour sleep varied from the first to the fourth (last) week. As illustrated for cohort 1 (Fig. 1, Table 1), sleep was greatly reduced during the 1-hour enforced wakefulness sessions and increased immediately afterwards. During the first week of study for both cohorts, the sleep fragmentation protocol decreased sleep over 24 hours and decreased sleep during the light phase without significantly affecting sleep during the dark phase (Table 1). In contrast to the first week, by the fourth week, the sleep fragmentation protocol was not associated with significant decreases in either 24-hour sleep or light phase sleep, perhaps due to the increased sleep (rebound sleep) occurring during the inter-fragmentation intervals (i.e., the time immediately following the enforced wakefulness sessions). Also, the sleep fragmentation protocol led to increased dark phase sleep during week 4. These findings indicated that the mice in both cohorts (eight months old and eleven months old, respectively) had adjusted their daily sleep patterns in response to the sleep fragmentation protocol.

As well as sleep as a percentage of time, sleep fragmentation influenced the duration of sleep bouts (Table 2). During week 1 of the study of the second cohort, the sleep fragmentation protocol significantly reduced the duration of light phase sleep bouts without affecting the duration of dark phase sleep bouts or 24-hour sleep bouts. During the recovery period (the weekend of undisturbed sleep preceding the fourth week of sleep fragmentation), sleep fragmentation led to increased durations of dark phase sleep bouts and of 24-hour sleep bouts but no change in duration of light phase sleep bouts. During the fourth week of the sleep fragmentation protocol, sleep bout duration during the dark phase was significantly increased by sleep fragmentation in cohort 1 and showed marginal significance (F1,14=4.45, p=0.0533) in cohort 2.

Effects of sleep fragmentation on neuropathology

A multivariate ANOVA indicated that overall Aβ increased with age in both the cortex (F4,25 = 270.421, p&lt;0.0001) and hippocampus (F4,25 = 95.12, p&lt;0.0001); this was true for both DEA- and RIP A- (F4,25 = 159.76, p&lt;0.0001) extracted samples, and for Aβ40 and Aβ42 (F4,25 = 70.388, p&lt;0.0001). This was an expected outcome for this mouse line, which exhibits moderately aggressive, age-related amyloid pathology. The sleep fragmentation protocol had no effect on cortical Aβ (F4,25 = 1.096, p&lt;0.5), but caused a significant increase in hippocampal Aβ (F4,25 = 3.59, p&lt;0.05). This effect was driven largely by Aβ42 in the RIPA fraction, which was the only individual hippocampal fraction to show a significant increase (F1,28 = 11.165, p&lt;0.005; Fig. 2). Individual contrasts between the sleep fragmented and undisturbed sleep groups, using t-tests accompanied by Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple post-hoc comparisons, yielded identical results (not shown). Interestingly, this outcome was essentially the same in cohorts 1 and 2, in that we did not detect an age × treatment interaction. As this result was, in effect, identical between two cohorts evaluated several months apart, this indicates that the increase in RIPA-extractable, hippocampal Aβ42 is both robust and reproducible, at least under the conditions evaluated in this study.

We were unable to reliably detect FA soluble Aβ in the first cohort (in which the mice were ~9 months old at the time of euthanasia); although we were able to detect FA soluble Aβ in the second cohort (in which the mice were ~12 months old at the end of the study), indicating a robust age-related effect, as previously reported (Oddo, et al., 2003;Bories et al., 2012). The Aβ values were more variable than those from the DEA and RIPA fractions. Although we were able to detect a significant increase following sleep fragmentation in the hippocampus (t7.9, p&lt;0.005; corrected d.f., for no assumption of equal variance) as compared to the cortex (p&gt;0.5), the variance was high (mean +/− s.e.m., in pmol/mg: US, 0.82 +/− 0.35; SF, 6.72 +/− 1.37). We were only able to measure total Aβ in this fraction (see methods), and as these values were out of necessity obtained using a different methodology, they cannot be directly compared to the DEA and RIPA fraction. Nonetheless, the finding that the general effect of increased Aβ in the hippocampus following sleep fragmentation can be detected using a different assay system lends additional support to one of the key findings of this study.

We did not observe appreciable differences in either total tau or phospho-tau in the RIPA soluble fraction in cohort 1. However, in cohort. 2, we did observe a marginally significant increase in total RIPA-soluble tau in the hippocampus (t14 = 2.01, p&lt;0.05; mean +/− s.e.m., in ng/mg: US, 111.8 +/− 25.9; SF, 198.3 +/− 34.3), but not in the cortex (p &gt; 0.5; mean +/− s.e.m., in ng/mg: US, 87.5 +/− 20.1; SF, 103.4 +/− 25.6). We did not observe corresponding changes in phosphorylated tau in this second cohort. These data should be interpreted cautiously in that the effect is only marginally significant (when directionality is assumed), we only examined a single epitope (in the case of phospho-tau), and as our tau examination was restricted to a single extractable fraction.

Effects of sleep fragmentation on neuroinflammation

To profile changes in neuroinflammation we analyzed gene expression changes in four classes of inflammatory markers in the hippocampus, and cortex. In the hippocampus we found higher levels of all the inflammatory markers in the sleep fragmentation group compared to the undisturbed sleep group (Fig. 3A). However, at the individual gene level, there was no statistically significant effect of sleep fragmentation. A composite Z-score of the three inflammatory markers in each class uncovered an effect of sleep fragmentation on increased expression of reactive microglia signature (Fig. 3B). For all of our analysis we found no effect of age of the mice, or interaction of age and treatment. In the neocortex, no significant effects of sleep fragmentation were observed on any of the four classes of inflammatory markers.

DISCUSSION

This study aimed totest if chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm would exacerbate amyloid and tau pathology and neuroinflammation. The study’s key findings show that chronic daily sleep fragmentation increases amyloid levels and the reactive microglia signature in the mouse hippocampus.

Chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm is a relatively understudied type of sleep disruption that has been associated with age-related cognitive decline and the risk and progression of AD (Tranah, et al., 2011;Lim, et al., 2013;Musiek, et al., 2018;Rogers-Soeder, et al., 2018;Li, et al., 2020). Our previous studies of daily sleep-wake rhythms in AD mouse models suggested that spontaneously occurring sleep fragmentation is associated with more severe Aβ accumulation (Duncan, et al., 2012;Sethi, et al., 2015). To test whether fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm is causally related to the progression of AD, female 3xTg-AD mice were subjected to four 1-hour intervals of manual enforced wakefulness during the light phase, for five days each week, for four weeks. For the mice subjected to enforced wakefulness, the percent sleep during the wakefulness interval was approximately one-quarter the value observed in the undisturbed group, as shown in Figure 1, although it varied, and the reduction of sleep during the last (late afternoon) interval of enforced wakefulness was more modest. The reduced effect of enforced wakefulness during the last interval may reflect an increased sleep drive due to a build-up of homeostatic pressure during the daily protocol and/or a daily rhythm in sleep latency. Despite the lack of complete sleep suppression, this sleep fragmentation protocol disrupted the daily sleep-wake rhythm and led to increased Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus as compared to the control condition (undisturbed sleep).

The sleep fragmentation protocol altered the daily distribution of sleep and wakefulness. In order to minimize the social isolation that occurs with the single-housing necessary for sleep recording, the sleep monitoring was limited to seven consecutive days rather than conducted throughout the entire study. Sleep monitoring was conducted during the first and fourth weeks so that the initial response and later adjustment to the sleep fragmentation protocol could be assessed. During both of these weeks, the one-hour enforced wakefulness sessions during the light phase created intervals of extended wakefulness during the normal rest phase of the 3xTg-AD mice, akin to nighttime awakenings in AD patients. The sleep fragmentation protocol also decreased total 24-hour sleep during the first week but not by the fourth week, when it increased dark phase sleep. Whether this increased sleep during the normal active phase represents a normal healthy adaptation to sleep fragmentation or a pathological response is not yet known, but will be investigated in future studies comparing sleep fragmentation in wild-type and AD mouse models. The latter finding mimics the increased sleepiness during the normal active phase (daytime) exhibited by AD patients (Prinz, et al., 1982;Bliwise, 2004;Bliwise, et al., 2011). While AD patients often exhibit lower amounts of total daily sleep, fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm—even in the absence of decreased total sleep—is associated with an elevated risk of AD (Lim, et al., 2013). Thus, the sleep fragmentation protocol used here with four one-hour intervals of enforced wakefulness evenly dispersed across the light phase induces changes in the daily sleep-wake rhythm that resemble those reported in AD patients. This sleep fragmentation protocol seems more relevant to the study of sleep disruption in AD mouse models than previously used protocols of either severe sleep restriction (Zhu et al., 2016;Zhu et al., 2018) or sleep fragmentation at two-minute intervals that mimics chronic obstructive sleep apnea patterns of sleep (Ramesh, et al., 2012;Kincheski, et al., 2017).

In the current study, the 3xTg-AD mice exposed to four weeks of chronic sleep fragmentation exhibited higher levels of Aβ in the hippocampus, especially in the RIPA-extracted samples. Notably, in the hippocampal RIPA fraction, the increase was predominantly in Aβ42, which is considered to be the more neurotoxic form of Aβ. Our findings of increased Aβ following sleep fragmentation agree with a prior study in APPswePS1de9 transgenic mice, which used chronic severe sleep restriction (Kang, et al., 2009;Qiu et al., 2016). Even though the increase was relatively small, it is possible that a longer duration of chronic sleep fragmentation would translate into large increases in age-related amyloid deposition. Further, the relative selectivity of the increase to the hippocampus, a structure critical to learning and memory that is severely affected in AD, implies that chronic sleep fragmentation should also lead to deficits in hippocampus-dependent tasks.

For the neuroinflammatory markers, we found an effect of sleep fragmentation but no effect of age. This is interesting, as it suggests that even with rapidly accelerating Aβ levels during the eight to eleven-month age range, the sleep fragmentation was a stronger driver of inflammation. While sleep fragmentation produced a consistent increase in all the inflammatory markers, the changes were small, and the variability was high within the groups. The aggressive nature of neuropathological changes in the 3xTg-AD mouse may account for a significant amount of the variability. Given the within-group variability, future studies will need a larger sample size to be adequately powered to detect a difference at the individual gene expression levels.

In contrast to its stimulation of Aβ levels and neuroinflammation, chronic daily sleep fragmentation did not greatly affect tau or phospho-tau. However, this should be interpreted cautiously because we only examined total tau and a single phospho-tau epitope in a single fraction. It is also possible that the effects of sleep fragmentation may have been masked by the aggressive P301L tau overexpression. In other words, with a small sample size it is likely that a small effect on tau of similar magnitude to the effect observed on Aβ might simply go undetected. It was encouraging that the modest effect that we saw was in the same direction, and in the same region, as the change in Aβ42. Future studies exploring chronic sleep fragmentation in younger 3xTg-AD mice, or in mice that express wild type human tau under the control of mouse tau promoter would be useful to further evaluate the effects of sleep fragmentation on tau pathology.

The current study had several limitations, including the use of only one AD mouse model, one sex (female), and one time of day (dark phase) of sleep fragmentation. The study also lacks fine neuroanatomical resolution. Because the measurements of Aβ, neuroinflammatory markers, tau, and phospho-tau were conducted with dissected tissue samples, possible variations in the effects of sleep fragmentation among discrete cortical or hippocampal subregions could not be determined. Also, the effects of chronic sleep fragmentation on other neuropathological features associated with AD, such as neuronal and synaptic loss, as well as cognitive decline, are as yet unknown. Because the sleep monitoring did not include EEG and EMG measurements, whether chronic sleep fragmentation selectively alters REM versus NREM sleep or induces loss of slow-wave sleep (SWS), which exacerbates the progression of AD (Maestri et al., 2015;Ju et al., 2017;Kastanenka et al., 2017;Kastanenka et al., 2019), remains to be determined. It is also noteworthy that since this is an entirely novel approach to sleep fragmentation that was designed primarily to detect large differences, it is likely that smaller effects would escape detection. For example, although we were able to detect both age and sleep fragmentation effects on Aβ, specifically Aβ42 changes in the hippocampus, it is entirely possible that smaller effects in other fractions would be missed. These effects could be detected in larger studies involving older animals, which would be likely to exhibit a much stronger Aβ signal, or in other mouse lines with more aggressive pathology.

It is possible that the sleep fragmentation protocol had a number of effects as well as disruption of the daily sleep-wake rhythm. The sleep fragmentation protocol included separation from cage-mates for four 1-h intervals, during weeks 2 and 3. The lack of control for this intermittent separation is a weakness of this study, but this separation was less than that during weeks 1 and 4, when all of the mice were singly housed continuously for sleep recording.

Finally, this study did not investigate how chronic sleep fragmentation leads to increases in neuropathology and neuroinflammation. It is interesting to consider whether these effects of sleep fragmentation may involve alterations in glucocorticoid secretion and/or circadian timing, which have been implicated in AD (Musiek et al., 2013;Musiek, 2017). Acute wakefulness during the usual rest phase induces transient increases in circulating glucorticoid levels and resets the phase of circadian rhythms (Duncan et al., 2014;Legan et al., 2015) and leads to changes in clock gene expression (Franken, 2013). Whether chronic sleep fragmentation has similar effects, and if so, whether these effects participate in the stimulation of neuropathology and neuroinflammation, are areas of investigation for future studies.

In conclusion, these studies in the 3xTg-AD mouse model reveal that chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake cycle induces sleep disruption similar to that associated with AD and stimulates hippocampal Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation, processes that contribute to the development and progression of AD. While many previous studies in mouse models have used chronic sleep restriction (Zhu, et al., 2016;Zhu, et al., 2018) as noted above, human studies of daily sleep restriction (i.e., only 4 hours of sleep per night for 8 nights), did not alter CSF levels of Aβ, tau, or phospho-tau and did not increase markers of glial activation (Olsson et al., 2018). Thus, chronic sleep fragmentation may be a more relevant model for the study of sleep disruption in AD mouse models. In conjunction with other reports, the current study emphasizes that sleep disruption is causally involved in the neuropathological progression of AD. Our findings help to explain the significant correlation in older humans between fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm and the risk of AD (Tranah, et al, 2011;Lim, et al., 2013). The findings also suggest that strategies to ameliorate sleep fragmentation might be explored as a means for decreasing the risk of AD or slowing its progression.

Figure 1. Effects of chronic sleep fragmentation on daily sleep-wake rhythms.

For each treatment group (undisturbed sleep or sleep fragmentation, n=8 each), the average daily sleep profile for the first (top) or fourth (bottom) week of Expt. 1 is shown. The values represent the mean +/− S.E.M. of sleep % at 30-minute intervals. On the X-axis, the time of day (clock time) is shown as a horizontal stripe with white representing the light phase and black representing the dark phase. The vertical gray bars represent the sleep fragmentation periods during which mice in the sleep fragmentation groups experienced enforced wakefulness with novel toys and gentle paintbrush stimulation.

Figure 2. Effects of sleep fragmentation on DEA- and RIPA-extractable Aβ40 and Aβ42 in hippocampus and cortex.

Sleep fragmentation resulted in a significant increase in Aβ42 in the hippocampus, but neither in the cortex, nor in the DEA fraction. Note also the substantial (~100-fold) increase in Aβ between the two experiments, and that the age-related increase in Aβ is greater in the hippocampus as compared to the cortex. Overlaid circles are values from individual mice. * = p&lt;0.05.

Figure 3: Effect of sleep fragmentation on mRNA neuroinflammatory markers in the hippocampus.

mRNA was extracted from bulk tissue and analyzed using real-time PCR. (A) Markers of inflammation were divided into three categories. At the individual gene level, no effect of age, sleep fragmentation, or interaction was found. (B) A composite Z-score of the three inflammatory markers for each class was used to measure inflammatory signatures. For reactive microglia signature, an overall effect was found (F3,29 = 3.0542, p&lt;0.05), and a significant effect of sleep fragmentation (t26 = 2.056, p=0.01), with no effect of age, or interaction. No statistically significant effects were found for the other three inflammatory signatures. Overlaid circles are values from individual mice.

Highlights

Four daily bouts of exposure to novelty and gentle stimulation fragment the daily sleep-wake rhythm in female 3xTg-AD mice.

Chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm for four weeks increases hippocampal amyloid-beta accumulation.

Chronic fragmentation of the daily sleep-wake rhythm also stimulates hippocampal neuroinflammation.

The cortex does not exhibit sleep fragmentation-induced effects on amyloid-beta or neuroinflammation.

These findings elucidate the correlation in humans between daily sleep-wake fragmentation and Alzheimer’s disease risk.
