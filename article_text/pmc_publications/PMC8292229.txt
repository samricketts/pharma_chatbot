Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is commonly associated with cognitive decline but is also composed of neuropsychiatric symptoms including psychological distress and alterations in mood, including anxiety and depression. Emotional dysfunction in AD is frequently modeled using tests of anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodents. These tests often include the elevated plus-maze, light/dark test and open field test. In this review, we describe prototypical behavioral paradigms used to examine emotional dysfunction in transgenic models of AD, specifically anxiety-like behavior. Next, we summarize the results of studies examining anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodents, noting that the behavioral outcomes using these paradigms have produced inconsistent results. We suggest that future research will benefit from using a battery of tests to examine emotional behavior in transgenic AD models. We conclude by discussing putative, overlapping neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD-related neuropathology, stress and anxiety-like behavior reported in AD models.

1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to functional impairments of memory loss and cognitive decline (Selkoe, 2001). Central to the disease is the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta “plaques”, which are cleaved protein fragments from amyloid precursor proteins (APP), and neurofibrillary tangles composed of microtubule associated hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. In the earliest stages of the disease, robust expression of plaques and tangles are observed throughout cortical-limbic circuitry, with some theories suggesting that plaque deposition triggers the later expression of tangle pathology (i.e., the amyloid cascade hypothesis). The behavioral manifestations of AD pathogenesis are severe deficits in cognitive function and emotional regulation, which are likely a consequence of pathology induced damage to the hippocampus, surrounding parahippocampal cortices, prefrontal cortex and limbic subcortical regions (Aggleton et al., 2016; Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Thal et al., 2002; Van Hoesen et al., 2000).

Preclinical research examining the neuropsychology of AD has primarily focused on memory impairments such as declines in spatial learning and memory (Berkowitz et al., 2020; Coughlan et al., 2018; 2019; Howett et al., 2019; Lester et al., 2017). However, in addition to cognitive decline, a number of reports indicate that the earliest stages of the disease are marked by neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychological distress and alterations in mood (Geda et al., 2013; Ferreti et al., 2001; Tayeb et al., 2014). As demonstrated in Dr. Alois Alzheimer’s first case, Auguste Deter displayed a striking cluster of symptoms that included memory impairments, emotional disturbances and paranoia (Maurer et al., 1997). Consistent with this early description, a number of studies indicate that Alzheimer’s patients exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety and depression that precede or present along with complaints of memory loss during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of the disease (Donovan et al., 2018; Gabryelewicz et al., 2004; Panza et al., 2010; Lyketsos et al., 2011). Importantly, results from a recent meta-analysis indicate that anxiety increases the risk for progressing to dementia in patients with MCI (Li and Li, 2018). Additionally, individuals exhibiting heightened anxiety have a 48% increased risk of developing AD (Petkus et al., 2016) and a faster rate of conversion from MCI to AD (Gallagher et al., 2011).

The high prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD has resulted in several reports directed toward the development of assessment protocols and programs of treatment (Geda et al., 2013; Lyketsos and Olin, 2002). Nevertheless, preclinical research aimed at evaluating emotional behavioral phenotypes in transgenic rodent models of AD-related pathology, which typically carry mutations to the APP and/or tau in mice, has received limited attention (e.g., Kosel et al., 2020). A general aim of this review is to summarize findings from studies investigating emotional behavior in rodent transgenic models of AD, with a specific emphasis on anxiety-like behavior. We consider several variables including the specific behavioral test, rodent model used and the impact of AD related pathology on neural circuitry involved in anxiety-like behavior.

In humans, anxiety has been defined as a negative emotional state characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, hypervigilance and physiological changes (e.g., activation of the stress response, rapid heart rate, increased blood pressure, etc.) in anticipation of a forthcoming threat (American Psychological Association 2013; Cryan and Holmes, 2005; McEwen et al., 2012). Importantly, if the neural systems underlying the manifestation of anxiety become dysregulated, the biobehavioral response to perceived threats can become excessive or inappropriate, potentially leading to the manifestation of several psychopathologies including anxiety/stress disorders (McEwen et al., 2012). In rodents, anxiety-like behavior has been defined as a motivated behavior (i.e., defensive behavior) that is elicited by exposure to potential and/or ambiguous threats (Blanchard et al., 2011). These behaviors often include risk assessment, which parallels the hypervigilance and/or rumination that is associated with anxiety in humans, and avoidance of areas where threat may occur. In the first section, we summarize a battery of behavioral tests that are typically used to examine anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodent models of AD. Next, we summarize the literature evaluating anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodent models of AD and speculate on the putative underlying neural mechanisms responsible for the expression of this behavior in both transgenic rodents and human AD patients. Our intent is to stimulate new research targeted at better understanding the neural bases of emotional disturbances in AD.

2. Modeling anxiety-like behavior in rodents

In this section, we highlight several well-characterized rodent models of anxiety-like behavior. The models discussed are by no means exhaustive; they are only a sample of models used to probe anxiety in rodents consisting of exposure to novel, elevated, open and/or brightly lit spaces. We chose to highlight these models mainly because they are the most common tests used to probe anxiety-like behavior in general, and particularly in transgenic models of AD. Models not discussed here, but should also be considered in future studies examining anxiety-like behavior in transgenic AD models, include the shock-probe burying test, elevated T-maze, Vogel and Geller-Seifter conflict tests, separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations, rat exposure test, mouse defensive test battery and predator odor exposure (for detailed model reviews see: de Brouwer et al., 2019; Blanchard et al., 2003; Cryan and Holmes, 2005; Belzung and Lemoine, 2011; Haller et al., 2013).

2.1. Elevated plus-maze.

The elevated plus-maze (EPM) is by far the most widely used task to examine anxiety-like behavior in general, as well as to probe anxiety-like behavior in transgenic models of AD specifically (see Figure 2). The test apparatus consists of four arms arranged as a “+” that are elevated above the floor (see Figure 1A). Each arm is joined at the center by a square platform, with two opposite “open” arms containing no walls and two opposite “closed” arms containing walls; the closed arms are often opaque to allow for detailed behavioral analysis. Test sessions are typically five – ten minutes in duration and are typically conducted under red or dim white light. The task generates a conflict in rodents based on their motivation to explore novel environments and the aversive properties of the open arms (Pellow et al., 1985). Although the aversive nature of the open arms has been described as an innate fear of heights (Lister, 1990), studies indicate that height alone is a relatively mild anxiogenic stimulus (Treit et al., 1993) and that rodents prefer the closed arms because they provide protection from potential predation (Dawson and Tricklebank, 1995). The classic manifestations of anxiety-like behavior in this test include the percentage of time spent in the open vs. closed arms as well as the number of open arm entries. Pharmacological studies have reported that standard anxiolytic (e.g., diazepam) or anxiogenic (e.g., picrotoxin) drugs increase or decrease, respectively, both the percentage of open arm time and the number of open arm entries (Handley and Mithani, 1984; for review see Griebel and Holmes, 2013) in both rats (Pellow et al., 1985) and mice (Lister, 1987). More recently, studies have expanded this assessment to include the ethological analysis of defensive behavior, particularly risk assessment (i.e., stretch-attend, stretch-approach, head-outs and head-dips), which has enhanced this task in accurately detecting changes in anxiety-like behavior (Rodgers et al., 1997; Carobrez and Bertoglio, 2005).

2.2. Zero maze.

The zero maze is a variant of the EPM that measures anxiety-like behavior in rodents (Shepherd et al., 1994). One caveat of the EPM is that animals spend a portion of their time in the center of the apparatus rather than the open or closed arms (Lee and Rodgers, 1990; Rodgers et al., 1992). Therefore, one advantage of the zero maze vs. the EPM is that it lacks a center area. The apparatus consists of a circular platform that contains four equal sized quadrants that are raised above the floor (see Figure 1B). Each quadrant alternates as being either “open” or “closed.” Similar to the EPM, behavioral testing in the zero maze is typically conducted under red or dim white light with test sessions lasting five – ten minutes (Shepherd et al., 1994). Behavioral measures include the percentage of time spent in the open areas and risk assessment (e.g., number of head-dips and stretch attends). Pharmacological studies have reported anxiolytic effects following administration of classic benzodiazepines including increased duration of time spent in the open areas, increased number of head dips and decreased number of stretched-attend postures (Shepherd et al., 1994; Bickerdike et al., 1994).

2.3. Light/dark test.

The light/dark test (LDT) has been used extensively to characterize anxiety-like behavior in rodents including several studies examining these behaviors in transgenic AD models (see Figure 2). The apparatus consists of two compartments: an open and illuminated ‘light’ compartment and an enclosed ‘dark’ compartment (see Figure 1C). The compartments are typically connected by a small opening located in the center of the apparatus; however modified versions of the task include a tunnel connecting the two chambers. Test sessions are typically five – ten minutes in duration and are conducted under varying degrees of white light; increasing or decreasing light intensity can decrease or increase, respectively, the expression of risk assessment behavior and the duration of time spent exploring the white compartment. The aversive nature of the light/dark test is based on rodents’ innate aversion to two mild stressors: the white light, and the novel and potentially threatening (i.e., predation) environment (Crawley and Goodwin, 1980). Primary measures of anxiety-like behavior include the percentage of time spent in the light vs. dark compartments, the number of light entries, latency to enter the light compartment and risk assessment (e.g., head-outs, stretch-attend and stretch-approach). Pharmacological studies using classic anti-anxiety compounds (e.g., benzodiazepines, buspirone, etc.) have consistently reported that acute drug injections produce anxiolytic-like effects in both rats and mice (Crawley, 1981; Shimada et al., 1995; Griebel et al., 1996; see Griebel and Holmes, 2013 for a thorough review).

2.4. Open field test.

The open field test (OFT) is another popular task for evaluating anxiety-like behavior and has been utilized to probe anxiety in transgenic rodent models of AD (see Figure 2). The test apparatus consists of a circular or square arena with the floor marked into sectors by concentric circles or squares, respectively; tall surrounding walls prevent escape (see Figure 1D). Test sessions are typically five – ten minutes in duration and are conducted under bright white light. Rodents naturally prefer the periphery of the open field and display risk assessment behaviors toward the center zone of the apparatus (Blanchard and Blanchard, 1971, 1989) due to an innate fear of potential predation. Thus, during testing, rodents exhibit high levels of peripheral activity and typically show thigmotaxis (wall-hugging), a behavior where the animal remains close to the vertical walls (Treit and Fundytus, 1988). Studies often use the OFT to examine locomotor activity and/or spatial exploration rather than anxiety-like behavior. In these two cases, rodents should be habituated to the apparatus prior to testing to eliminate/lower levels of anxiety-like behavior, while researchers examining anxiety-like behavior should avoid habituation to maximize perceived/potential threat. Additional indices of anxiety include indirect measures of sympathetic nervous system activation (i.e., defecation and urination) and the latency to consume food located in the center zone of the apparatus (Hall, 1934); the placement of food presumably increases animals’ motivation to explore the center area thereby generating an approach-avoidance conflict indicative of anxiety. Studies have provided pharmacological validation for the OFT with standard anxiolytic drugs (e.g., diazepam, buspirone, etc.) increasing the duration of time spent in- and the number of entries into- the center zone of the open field (for review see Prut and Belzung, 2003; and Griebel and Holmes, 2013). Readers should note that in our summary of transgenic effects on anxiety-like behavior (Figure 2) we have listed the reported outcomes. However, some of these results were based on vertical and peripheral activity rather than thigmotaxis or center time, and thus readers are encouraged to interpret these results with some degree of caution.

2.5. Marble burying test.

The marble burying test (MBT) is another behavioral task used to assess anxiety-like behavior in rodents. In this task, rodents are placed into a cage filled with bedding substrate and small glass marbles. Burying is a natural behavior defined by displacing bedding material with the forepaws and snout in an attempt to bury an object, and importantly, is usually elicited in response to aversive stimuli (Pinel and Triet, 1978). Several studies have validated the MBT as a screening tool for anti-anxiety drugs with general decreases in marble burying reported after administration of various anxiolytics (e.g., diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam and ethanol; Archer et al., 1987; Broekkamp et al., 1986; Nicolas et al., 2006; Njung’e and Handley, 1991). Although this task has been used to assess anxiety-like behaviors, its validity has been questioned. For instance, Thomas and colleagues (2009) reported behavioral differences across inbred mouse strains but found no correlation in anxiety-like behavior in the MBT with other tests of anxiety (e.g., light/dark test, OFT). Thus, given that marble burying involves digging behavior, some have argued that it may be a model of repetitive behaviors (Korff and Harvey, 2006) rather than anxiety. However, rather than critique the MBT may represent a good task to examine repetitive behaviors associated with specific anxiety/stress disorders (e.g., obsessive compulsive disorder).

2.6. Social interaction test.

The social interaction test (SIT) is another common task used to examine anxiety-like behavior in rodents. This test was developed based on the premise that levels of anxiety modulate social behavior in rodents, with low and high levels of anxiety associated with an increase and decrease, respectively, in social interaction time (sniffing, following, and grooming the partner, boxing and wrestling; File and Hyde, 1978). A valuable feature of this test is that it models both high and low continuums of anxiety-like behavior, which has been pharmacologically validated using classic anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs (for a thorough review see: File and Seth, 2003). To model both extremes of anxiety typically the test conditions, including light levels and the familiarity of the test arena, are manipulated yielding four test conditions: low light – familiar arena (lowest level of anxiety); high light – familiar arena and low light – unfamiliar arena (generating moderate levels of anxiety); and high light – unfamiliar arena (generating the highest level of anxiety). Therefore, measures of social interaction are highest when rodents are in a familiar arena lit by low light and decrease when the environment becomes more aversive or anxiogenic. Thus, to detect anxiolytic effects test parameters are adjusted to minimize levels of social interaction, while anxiogenic effects are detected by maximizing levels of social interaction. Additional aversive cues, such as loud noise, or exposure to cat odor or fresh rat blood can also be used to increase anxiety-like behavior and reduce social interaction time (Zangrossi and File, 1992; File, 1994).

3. Genetics and neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease

Typically, AD is diagnosed as either early-onset familial (FAD) or late-onset sporadic. FAD is a rare, autosomal-dominant inherited form of the disorder (~5% of all AD patients) that typically manifests before the age of 65. In contrast, sporadic AD is the predominate, non-heritable form of the disorder (~95% of all AD patients) that usually manifests after the age of 65 (Bird, 2008; Ortiz et al., 2015; Bekris et al., 2010).

Three genetic mutations have been identified as independent causal factors for developing FAD: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes. Each of these FAD-linked mutations directly alters the amyloidogenic processing of APP to enhance the production, and possibly reduce the clearance, of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, resulting in increased cerebral deposition of “senile” neurotoxic Aβ plaques. Additional neuropathological features include formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau), glial activation and inflammation, and neurodegeneration and cell loss (Newman et al., 2007; Baranello et al., 2015; Zuroff et al., 2017; Nilsson et al., 2013; Sasaguri et al., 2017; Mawuenyega et al., 2010; Kline, 2012; O’Brien and Wong, 2011; Wang et al., 2006; Selkoe et al., 2001). There are known risks for sporadic AD but no causative genes for late-onset AD.

Although the precise causes of AD are unknown, a large body of research has argued for the “amyloid cascade hypothesis”. This theory advocates that accumulation of Aβ is the initiating event in AD pathogenesis, and that deposition of cerebral Aβ is both necessary and sufficient for development of AD (for review see Hardy &amp; Selkoe, 2002). The strongest support for the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” comes from human genetic evidence, which shows that inheritance of any one or more of the autosomal dominant (APP, PS1, or PS2) mutations invariably leads to FAD (Musiek and Holtzman, 2015). Further support stems from human patients with trisomy 21 (i.e. Down’s syndrome) harboring triple APP duplications. These patients consequently develop Aβ plaques and exhibit AD-related pathologies including the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, synaptic injury, cell loss, and cognitive impairments (Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). Importantly, antibodies targeting amyloid production have been reported to slow cognitive decline in recent trials (reviewed in Vaz &amp; Silvestre, 2020).

4. Transgenic rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease

Preclinical rodent models of AD are largely generated based on FAD-linked mutations (see Figure 3). Although there are numerous transgenic rodent models of AD, most do not exhibit full spectrum AD-related pathology (Casadesus et al., 2010), which may limit the utility of characterizing their behavioral phenotypes (see also Kosel et al., 2020). The majority of transgenic rodent models are developed in mice and have mutations targeting the APP and PS1 genes (Gotz et al., 2018), and/or exogenous human tau mutations (h-Tau), which alter APP and tau processing respectively, to accelerate AD pathology (Sasaguri et al., 2017). Mutations of these genes often lead to the development of amyloid-beta fragments and plaques. However, the hyperphosphorylated tau that results in neurofibrillary tangles is rarely observed. This is problematic given that AD is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and cell loss. While using mice to model AD may be easier from a technical standpoint, rat models may be more biologically relevant (Do Carmo, &amp; Cuello, 2013). For instance, compared to mice, rats are genetically and physiologically more similar to humans (Jacob &amp; Kwitek, 2002) and like humans, rats also have six isoforms of tau (Hanes et al., 2009). Additional advantages of rat model systems include a larger brain size, which can be beneficial for higher resolution neuroimaging (Gotz et al., 2018), as well as greater behavioral performance in tests of learning and memory (Pompl et al., 1999; Thompson et al., 2018; Whishaw, 1995; Whishaw &amp; Tomie, 1996; Whishaw et al., 2001).

There are currently a limited number of transgenic rat models of AD (Gotz et al., 2018). The McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat model expresses mutant APP751 with Swedish and Indiana mutations resulting in intracellular amyloid deposits detected as early as the first postnatal week and plaque pathology detected at 6 months of age (Leon et al., 2010). Although the McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat model does not develop tangle pathology (Do Carmo &amp; Cuello, 2013), plaque pathology exhibits the characteristic spread to anatomically connected regions (Heggland et al., 2015) and selective cell loss has been observed in the subiculum of the hippocampal formation at 18 months of age (Heggland et al., 2015). In addition, changes in the excitability of entorhinal cortical neurons have been observed as early as 4 months of age (Heggland et al., 2019), and deficits in synaptic neurotransmission in CA3-to-CA1 synapses between 4–6 months of age (Qi et al., 2019). Thus, the McGill model exhibits changes to hippocampal structures and function at early stages of pathology, consistent with MCI and AD in humans (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Thal et al., 2002).

The TgF344-AD rat model expresses both the mutant human APPSW and PS1ΔE9 genes resulting in a comprehensive profile of AD-related neuropathology throughout cortical and hippocampal brain regions associated with the human condition (Cohen et al., 2013; Joo et al., 2017; Rorabaugh et al., 2017). Most importantly, a progressive increase in tangle pathology, neurovascular dysfunction, neuroinflammation and cell loss have been reported in the TgF344-AD rat model (Cohen et al., 2013; Joo et al., 2017; Rorabaugh et al., 2017). Elevated oligomeric amyloid, hyperphosphorylated tau and activated microglia pathology have been reported as early as 6 months of age, and increase substantially with age (Cohen et al., 2013; Rorabaugh et al., 2017). The progression of tau pathology is consistent with Braak staging in AD patients (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991) with hyperphosphorylated tau endogenously expressed in brainstem regions such as the locus coeruleus prior to tau pathology in hippocampal regions (Rorabaugh et al., 2017) consistent with the developmental expression of the neuropathology in human AD patients (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991).

5. Anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease

Using the behavioral tasks described in the section above, much of the work investigating anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodent models of AD have reported variable results. Figure 2 summarizes a large sample of studies in which increases, decreases or no differences in anxiety-like behavior have been reported between transgenic rodents expressing Alzheimer’s-related pathology and wild-type counterparts. It is important to make note that our summary of the anxiety literature includes investigations in which transgenic subjects received additional manipulations, or pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise, stress, etc.). Figure 2 summarizes these studies only if “untreated” transgenic animals and assessment of anxiety-like behaviors were included in the study design.

In general, our summary of this literature suggests that assessment of anxiety-like behavior in various transgenic rodent models of AD has produced inconsistent and contradictory findings across different behavioral tests. For example, some studies report decreased anxiety-like behavior in EC-APP (EPM; Harris et al., 2010), Tg2576 (EPM; Gil-Bea et al., 2007, Lalonde et al., 2003, Ognibene et al., 2005) and 5xFAD Tg6799 (EPM; Jawhar et al., 2012) mice, while other studies report increased anxiety-like behavior in APP/hAβ/PS1 (EPM and LDT: Guo et al., 2012), Tg2576 (LDT; Dong et al., 2012), PDAPP-J20 (OFT; Beauquis et al., 2014), APPSWE (EPM; Bedrosian et al., 2011) and TgAPP (EPM; Lee et al., 2004) mice. Other studies report no differences in anxiety-like behavior in TgCRND8 (OFT and EPM; Touma et al., 2004) and Tg2576 mice (EPM; Arendash et al., 2001), as well as McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats (EPM; Galeano et al., 2014). However, a more recent study reported heightened anxiety in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat model when using the LDT but not the EPM (Petrasek et al., 2018).

Several recent studies have investigated anxiety-like behavior in the TgF344-AD rat model of AD-related pathology. For instance, Pentkowski et al (2018) tested male and female TgF344-AD rats, between four and six months of age, a time where plaque burden and hyperphosphorylated tau expression are minimal (Cohen et al., 2013; Rorabaugh et al., 2017). Regardless of sex, TgF344-AD rats exhibited an increase in anxiety-like defensive behavior (i.e., a decrease in open-arm exploration) in the EPM (Pentkowski et al., 2018). Importantly, this pattern of decreased open-arm exploration by transgenic rats was not due to a lack of open arm exploration, as there were no differences in the number of open-arm entries. In addition, there were no differences in locomotor activity (e.g., total distance traveled) during testing (see also Cohen et al., 2013; Morrone et al 2020; Sare et al., 2020). Thus, behavioral disinhibition (i.e., increases in locomotor activity), which may appear as reduced anxiety-like behavior (Lalonde et al., 2003; Ognibene et al., 2005; Gil-Bea et al., 2007; Roberson et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2018), is not a likely explanation for enhanced anxiety-like behavior in TgF344-AD rats. Other studies have replicated these observations in the EPM using animals at different ages (6 months, Pentkowski et al., in prep and Ceyzeriat et al., 2020; 9 months, Tournier et al., 2020; 12 months, Wu et al., 2020; 12 months). In contrast to the findings above, two recent studies have reported conflicting results when TgF344-AD rats are tested in the OFT with one study observing heightened anxiety-like behavior (fewer entries in the center of the open field) in TgF344-AD rats at 12 months of age (Wu et al., 2020) and a second study showing similar OFT behavior between control and TgF344-AD rats at 9 months of age (Morrone et al., 2020). Thus, although elevated anxiety-like behavior in TgF344-AD rats has been consistently observed in the EPM across several ages and laboratories, whether similar patterns of anxiety-like behavior is consistently observed in other behavioral tests such as the OFT requires further investigation.

Pentkowski et al (2018) also investigated whether this pattern of heightened defensive behavior co-occurred with deficits in spatial memory as measured using the hidden platform variant of the Morris water task. In general, no differences were detected between 4 to 6-month-old transgenic and wild-type rats on measures of swim latency to the hidden platform location or in rats searching near the platform location during a platform removal probe test (see also Berkowitz et al., 2018). A similar absence of spatial deficits in the Barnes maze has been reported at 12 months of age (Wu et al., 2020). It is important to note, however, that some studies have reported deficits in spatial reversal learning (hidden platform moved to a different spatial location) in TgF344-AD rats at six months of age (Cohen et al., 2013; Rorabaugh et al., 2017). Further, a recent study has shown that transgenic rats execute less precise trajectories to the hidden platform as early as 7 to 8-months of age (Berkowitz et al., 2018) and exhibits spatial deficits in the Y-maze at 9 months of age (Tournier et al., 2020). Together, these observations suggest that cognitive deficits might only be exposed during tests of rapid spatial learning or with careful analysis of navigational trajectories. Nevertheless, the results of Pentkowski et al. (2018) suggests that anxiety-like behavior can be detected at a time-point prior to the development of robust AD-related pathology (e.g., plaques, tangles, and spatial memory impairments).

A general conclusion from the summary above is that measurement of anxiety-like behavior has been largely inconsistent across different transgenic lines. These observations highlight the limitations of current approaches using transgenic rodents to accurately model preclinical AD-related behavioral pathology. A number of factors likely contribute to these inconsistent results. First, studies are often conducted at various developmental periods of pathogenesis (i.e., preclinical stage vs. dementia stages) resulting in differences in the magnitude of pathology in neural circuits underlying anxiety-like defensive behaviors (i.e., hippocampus, frontal cortex, amygdala). For example, APP/PS1 transgenic mice develop early behavioral disturbances between 3–6 months of age (Lalonde et al., 2004; Reiserer et al., 2007), while Tg2576 mice manifest behavioral disturbances between 9–11 months of age (Gil-Bea et al., 2007). Further, studies often fail to characterize anxiogenic-like phenotypes in transgenic rodents at the “pre-amyloid stages” of AD development (Boon et al., 2010, Galeano et al., 2014, Lalonde et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2004).

Second, given that many studies use a single behavioral paradigm to evaluate anxiety-like behavior, it is possible that inconsistent behavioral results are a consequence of an inadequate assessment of anxiety. Therefore, we suggest that future studies should incorporate a battery of tests characterizing anxiety-like phenotypes in transgenic animals. As described in the section above, a test battery could include a combination of the standard assessments utilizing conflict as the major threat source (EPM, OFT and LDT), as well as additional models such as the SIT, predator threat and/or shock-probe burying test. A third important factor to consider is that many studies have utilized transgenic animals that do not manifest neurofibrillary tangles and do not exhibit neurodegeneration (Casadesus et al., 2010; Do Carmo &amp; Cuello, 2013; Epis et al., 2010; Jucker, 2010; Laferla &amp; Green, 2012; Sabbagh et al., 2013). Tangle expression is a critical feature of AD-related pathology and has been associated with deficits in synaptic function and metabolic decline (Jackson et al., 2017; Pascoal et al., 2017). Lastly, the contradictory findings may result from inherent phenotypic differences in behavioral disinhibition (i.e., increased locomotor activity) that appear as reduced anxiety-like behavior (Gil-Bea et al., 2007; Lalonde et al., 2003; Ognibene et al., 2005; Roberson et al., 2007).

6. Neural mechanisms of anxiety-like behavior

The neurobiological mechanisms controlling the expression of anxiety-like behavior has evolved immensely from the original “fight or flight” construct (Cannon, 1915). Indeed, several discrete and interconnected neural circuits including the hippocampus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), periaqueductal gray (PAG) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been implicated in modulating anxiety-like behavior (for review see: Canteras et al., 2010; Gross &amp; Canteras, 2012; Perusini and Fanselow, 2015). However, based on its critical role in the pathophysiology of AD and the biological response to stress (see section below), this brief review will focus on the contribution of the hippocampus in regulating anxiety.

Gray and McNaughton (2000) initially proposed that the hippocampus is a critical component of the behavioral inhibition system (septo-hippocampal system) and that its primary function is to suppress inappropriate responses in situations of conflict or threat, including anxiogenic stimuli. Studies investigating the hippocampal formation have largely supported their assertion and have revealed a functional differentiation across its dorsoventral axis (Risold &amp; Swanson, 1996; Moser &amp; Moser, 1998), with the dorsal pole (dHC) involved in various forms of memory and the ventral pole (vHC) involved in emotional regulation (for review see: Fanselow and Hong-Wei, 2010; Kheirbek et al., 2013; Strange et al., 2014). For instance, Bannerman et al. (2002) reported a double dissociation where vHC but not dHC cytotoxic lesions reduce anxiety-like behaviors, while dHC but not vHC cytotoxic lesions produce working and spatial memory deficits. Similarly, rats with vHC but not dHC excitotoxic lesions exhibit reduced indices of anxiety across a range of behavioral tests including the SIT, LDT, hyponeophagia, shock-probe burying, EPM, cat odor and successive alley tests (Bannermann et al., 2003; Degroot and Treit, 2004; McHugh et al., 2004; Pentkowski et al., 2006; Trivedi and Coover, 2004). Selective vHC inhibition using lidocaine (Bertoglio et al., 2006), ibotenic acid (Kjelstrup et al., 2002) and tetrodotoxin (Degroot &amp; Treit, 2004) also reduces anxiety-like behavior in the EPM. Results from these lesion/inactivation studies clearly ascribe a critical role for the vHC in modulating anxiety-like behavior in rodents. Importantly, these findings have been extended to both non-human primates and humans. Monkeys with selective vHC lesions exhibit reduced anxiety-like behavior during testing in a predator-based approach-avoidance conflict task (Chudasama et al. 2008; 2009), effects similar to predator models of anxiety-like behavior in rats (Pentkowski et al., 2006). In humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that perceived threat engages the anterior hippocampus (Abivardi et al., 2020), the human homolog of the rodent vHC, and that patients with selective anterior hippocampal lesions show reduced avoidance of threatening stimuli (Bach et al., 2014; O’Neil et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings highlight the vHC as a key structure controlling the expression of anxiety-like behavior in rodents, primates and humans.

The vHC consists of several heterogeneously distributed cell types including glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic neurons (Siegel et al., 1994; Freund &amp; Buzsaki, 1996; Nomura et al, 1997; Spencer &amp; Bland, 2019). Micro-infusion studies targeting specific receptors within these cellular populations highlight the complexity of the ventral hippocampal system in regulating anxiety-like behavior. For instance, glutamate antagonists (Zhang et al, 2001; Hackl &amp; Carobrez, 2007; Marrocco et al., 2012; but see Liu et al., 2019), GABAA agonists (Bast et al., 2001; Trent and Menard, 2010; McEown and Treit, 2010; Zhang et al., 2014), cholinergic agonists (Degroot &amp; Treit, 2002), nitric oxide (Calixto et al., 2010) and mineralocorticoid antagonists (McEown &amp; Treit, 2011) all attenuate anxiety-like behavior in several tasks including the EPM, shock-probe burying test, OFT, elevated T-maze and LDT. Additionally, Pentkowski and colleagues (2009), reported that ventral hippocampal CRF1 receptors exert bidirectional control of anxiety-like behavior in response to cat odor following micro-infusions of either a CRF1 antagonist (decrease) or CRF1 agonist (increase) into the vHC. Collectively, these data indicate that dynamic ventral hippocampal neuronal activity is involved in regulating the expression of anxiety-like behavior in rodents.

Neural connectivity between the hippocampus and the amygdala, PFC, BNST, lateral septum and hypothalamus provide an anatomical basis for the vHC in regulating anxiety (for review see Canteras, 2002; Canteras et al., 2010). For instance, intermediate regions of ventral hippocampal CA1 and the subiculum project to several regions of the amygdala including the basolateral, lateral, medial and posterior basomedial nuclei (Canteras and Swanson, 1992; Petrovich et al., 1996, 2001; Pikkarainen et al., 1999; Ishikawa and Nakamura, 2006; Kim and Cho, 2017), neural structures implicated in mediating various aspects of anxiety-like defensive behavior (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005; Rosen, 2004; Canteras et al., 2010; Hare and Duman, 2020; Sangha et al., 2020). Intermediate regions of ventral hippocampal CA1 and the subiculum also project indirectly to the hypothalamus via projections through the dorsal region of the ventrolateral zone of the rostral part of the lateral septal nucleus (Risold and Swanson, 1997) to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus and dorsal premammillary nucleus (Canteras et al., 2001; Comoli et al., 2000; Risold and Swanson, 1997). These hypothalamic structures, along with the dorsomedial portion of the ventromedial hypothalamus, form the medial hypothalamic zone, a core circuit integrating and initiating the expression of defensive behaviors to innate threats, including anxiogenic stimuli (Blanchard et al., 2005; Canteras, 2002; Canteras and Graeff, 2014; Canteras et al., 2010; Gross and Canteras, 2012).

Contemporary genetic manipulations in rodents have helped to elucidate the specific contribution of several vHC efferent pathways in modulating anxiety-like behavior. For instance, chemogenetic inhibition of vHC CaMKII-expressing glutamate neurons decreases anxiety-like behavior in the EPM (Parfitt et al, 2017; Maestas-Olguin et al., 2021). Interestingly, these effects involve specific vHC cellular populations, as genetic silencing of specific ventral hippocampal efferent projections to the mPFC (Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016; Parfitt et al, 2017) or lateral hypothalamic area (Jimenez et al., 2018) reduce anxiety-like behavior.

An additional strategy to elucidate the role of vHC circuitry in anxiety-like behavior has been to monitor hippocampal neural activity during active behavior (reviewed in Caliskan &amp; Stork, 2019). During active behavior, hippocampal neurons discharge synchronously or oscillate, with rhythmic fluctuations in the excitability of local circuitry (Buzsaki, 2006). The predominant hippocampal oscillation during active locomotion are theta (6–12Hz) and gamma (30–100Hz) rhythms (Buzsaki, 2002; Buzsaki &amp; Wang, 2012). Modulation of hippocampal neuronal activity by theta and gamma rhythms, and the cross-frequency coupling of theta and gamma, is thought to play a critical role in the organization and transmission of information across hippocampal circuitry (Buzsaki, 2002; Buzsaki &amp; Wang, 2012; Colgin et al., 2009). Whether these oscillations are dynamically modulated by anxiety-like behavior has received considerable attention (see Caliskan &amp; Stork, 2019). Briefly, the power and coherence of vHC theta and mPFC theta rhythms has been shown to increase with exposure to the EPM or OFT (Adhikari et al., 2010). Furthermore, EPM specific neural activity recorded in the mPFC is locked to vHC theta rhythms (Adhikari et al., 2011), suggesting that cell assemblies in the mPFC are coordinated by vHC theta oscillations. In humans, increases in hippocampal gamma power, hippocampal theta-gamma coupling, and coherence between hippocampal and mPFC theta have also been reported after presentation of anxiogenic stimuli (Khemka et al., 2017). Lastly, similar increases in theta power and coherence have been observed across vHC and amygdalar circuits during EPM and OFT testing (Jacinto et al., 2013; 2016). Thus, these findings suggest that the expression of anxiety-like behavior in rodents may be coordinated by the dynamic coupling of neural signals and oscillations within the vHC and cortical/subcortical circuitry. Although Alzheimer’s-related pathology disrupts theta/gamma oscillations in several transgenic models (e.g., Mably et al., 2017; Morrone et al., 2020; Nakazono et al., 2017), the relationship between oscillatory dysfunction and anxiety-like behaviors in AD, and their dynamic interactions across vHC circuits, has not been experimentally investigated.

7. Hippocampal role in stress response

Stimuli that are perceived as stressful (stressors) culminate in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis (for a thorough review see: Herman et al., 2016). Briefly, initiation of the stress response begins when neuroendocrine cells in the medial parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) release the primary adrenal secretagogue corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), as well as oxytocin and arginine vasopressin (AVP); in this context some refer to CRF as corticotropin releasing hormone. CRF is released directly into the hypophysial portal vein and travels to the anterior pituitary to stimulate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone, which is then released into systemic circulation where it facilitates the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex; primary glucocorticoids are cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. Glucocorticoids are capable of regulating subsequent HPA axis activation through negative feedback mechanisms located in the pituitary and throughout various brain regions including the hippocampus, frontal cortex and hypothalamus. This negative feedback results from glucocorticoids binding to glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors. The later have a 5–10 fold greater affinity for glucocorticoids and appear to mediate basal levels, whereas GR binding tends to occur in response to increased glucocorticoid level and thus facilitates a post-stress return to baseline. In the hippocampus specifically, negative feedback is initiated by glucocorticoid binding to ventral hippocampal GR and MR receptors eventually leading to decreased PVN activation via glutamatergic outputs from the ventral subiculum.

8. Hippocampal stress systems and anxiety

At the earliest stages of the AD, including MCI, medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus exhibit profound plaque and tangle neuropathology and atrophy (Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Carlesimo et al., 2015; Jack et al., 2000; Kantarci et al., 2016; Thal et al., 2002). In addition, it is well documented that AD patients display abnormalities in stress systems including elevated levels of cortisol (Davis et al., 1986; Hartmann et al., 1997; Huang et al., 2009), reductions in CRF immunoreactive cells and increased expression of CRF receptors (De Souza et al., 1986; Whitehouse et al., 1987; Pomara et al., 1989). Although these stress pathologies are often detected in AD patients, and not during the pre-AD phase, the increases in cortisol have been reported during the MCI stage (Lupien et al., 1998; Csernansky et al., 2006; Lind et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009) suggesting that elevated stress responsivity may exacerbate and/or drive AD-related pathology.

Based on altered stress signaling in AD patients, the reported anxiogenic-like phenotype in TgF344-AD rats may involves CRF systems within circuits mediating anxiety-like behavior, including the hippocampus, amygdala and the locus coeruleus (for review see Canteras et al., 2009, 2010; LeDoux and Daw, 2018). These behavioral effects of CRF are likely mediated via actions at the G protein-coupled receptor subtype CRF1 (Spiess et al., 1981; Vale et al., 1981). Indeed, activation or inhibition of ventral hippocampal CRF1 increases or decreases, respectively, anxiety-like behavior in wildtype rats (Pentkowski et al., 2009). In the APP/hAβ/PS1 transgenic mouse model, anxiogenic-like phenotypes tend to correlate with higher levels of CRF within brain regions associated with stress-related circuitry (Guo et al., 2012). Importantly, this heightened level of anxiety-like behavior can be eliminated in transgenic mice that are also heterozygous for CRF1. A growing body of evidence from transgenic mouse models also suggests that increased activation of the HPA axis often precedes plaque formation (Dong et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2012; Rothman et al., 2012; Hebda-Bauer et al., 2013; Brureau et al., 2013). In contrast, late-stage AD involves CRF1-dependent Aβ- (Dong et al., 2004, 2012, 2014; Kang et al., 2007; Justice et al., 2015; Zang et al., 2016) and phosphorylated tau-induced (Rissman et al., 2007, 2012; Carroll et al., 2011) pathological alterations, particularly in the hippocampus. Together, these data highlight the critical role of hippocampal CRF1 systems in modulating anxiety-like behavior and AD-related neuropathology, and underscore the need for future studies examining these stress systems in the TgF344-AD model, particularly at the early pre-AD phase.

9. Conclusions and future directions

A hallmark feature of AD is the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta “plaques” that are cleaved protein fragments from amyloid precursor proteins, and neurofibrillary tangles composed of microtubule associated hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. Research on the consequences of AD pathology is most commonly associated with memory loss and cognitive decline but is also composed of a cluster of neuropsychiatric symptoms including psychological distress and emotional dysfunction. Alzheimer’s disease patients often exhibit neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression that precede or present along with complaints of memory loss during the MCI stage of the disease.

Emotional dysfunction in AD has frequently been studied using models of anxiety-like behavior in transgenic rodents, particularly the EPM, LDT and OFT. Figure 2 represents a summary of this literature and points to the general conclusion that behavioral outcomes using standard indices of anxiety-like behavior in transgenic mice have generally produced inconsistent results. Specifically, studies have reported either robust deficits or exacerbated anxiety-like defensive behavior, or null effects. These differences may be due to the impact of progressive amyloid and tangle pathology, different ages tested, or an incomplete assessment of anxiety-like behavior. Thus, future research will benefit from examining anxiety-like behavior in transgenic models expressing the full spectrum of AD-related pathology. Additionally, in order fully characterize anxiety-like behavior across all AD transgenic models, studies should examine this phenotype using a variety of behavioral tests that include conflict (EPM, LDT, OFT, etc.), social situations (SIT), pain (shock-probe burying test) and predator threat (predator odor, rat exposure test, mouse defensive test battery, etc.) as the anxiety-inducing stimulus. Indeed, the ability to detect enhanced anxiety has been reported to be test specific using the same transgenic model at the same timepoint (Petrasek et al., 2018). Importantly, to parallel the human disease state these test batteries should be conducted at early timepoints before AD-related neuropathology is robust. An important issue will be to address whether an anxiety phenotype can be isolated in relation to other emotional disturbances such as behaviors related to depression. An examination of this possibility is of importance as anxiety and depression often co-occur in human AD patients (e.g., Donovan et al., 2018; Gabryelewicz et al., 2004; Ringman, 2015; Rosenberg et al., 2011; Stella et al., 2014). Lastly, the putative neurobiological mechanisms underlying anxiety-like behavior in TgF344-AD rats needs to be examined. Based on previous reports in AD transgenic mice, these systems likely involve alterations in neural stress systems, particularly elevated levels of CRF signaling within limbic circuitry.

Highlights

Human Alzheimer’s patients exhibit anxiety at the mild cognitive impairment stage of the disease, which is associated with an increased likelihood of developing dementia.

Transgenic rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease exhibit inconsistent markers of anxiety.

The TgF344-AD rat model exhibits full spectrum Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology and shows reliable markers of enhanced anxiety at ages where amyloid burden is low.
