Excessive activity of striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) in the brain has been detected in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. Notably, knockdown of STEP in an Alzheimer mouse model effected an increase in the phosphorylation levels of downstream STEP substrates and a significant reversal in the observed cognitive and memory deficits. These data point to the promising potential of STEP as a target for drug discovery in Alzheimer’s treatment. We previously reported a substrate-based approach to the development of low molecular weight STEP inhibitors with Ki values as low as 7.8 μM. Herein, we disclose the first X-ray crystal structures of inhibitors bound to STEP and the surprising finding that they occupy non-coincident binding sites. Moreover, we utilize this structural information to optimize the inhibitor structure to achieve a Ki of 110 nM, with 15 to 60-fold selectivity across a series of phosphatases.

Graphical Abstract


INTRODUCTION

Proper cognitive function requires robust synaptic connections, possessing the ability to strengthen or weaken based upon tightly regulated neuronal signaling.1,2 Aberrations in systems within the central nervous system (CNS) that control synaptic plasticity have been implicated in various cognitive and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD),3,4 schizophrenia,5–7 and fragile X syndrome.8–10 Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP, PTPN5) belongs to a family of tyrosine-specific protein phosphatases (PTPs) enriched in the CNS, particularly the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex.11–18 Recent studies into STEP’s function have led to the conclusion that it opposes synaptic strengthening through its actions on substrate proteins.

STEP-mediated dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2),19 mitogen-activated protein kinase p38,20 proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2),21 and the Src family tyrosine kinase Fyn leads to their inactivation.22 STEP also dephosphorylates the GluN2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)23–25 and the GluA2 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR),26 which induces their internalization via endocytosis. Long-term potentiation (LTP),27,28 an increase in synaptic strength and plasticity that relies on ERK1/229 and Pyk2,30 as well as transmembrane NMDAR31 and AMPAR function,32 is one of the fundamental neuronal mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Dephosphorylation of these kinases and transmembrane ion channels consequently results in an overall reduction in synaptic control of LTP.

The potential of STEP as a therapeutic target in AD was suggested through genetic reduction of STEP activity in a triple transgenic AD mouse model.33 Knockout of STEP expression in these mice improved cognitive function up to the level of normal wild type mice as determined by several memory and cognitive tests. Furthermore, mice null for STEP exhibited restored levels of phospho-GluN2B in hippocampal synaptosomal membranes as well as enhanced levels of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-Fyn. Taken together, these findings suggest that STEP represents a promising therapeutic target for AD.

However, a significant caveat toward the development of STEP inhibitors is the widespread recognition that PTPs are extremely challenging targets for the development of small molecule inhibitors due to the highly positively charged nature and the significant structural homology of PTP active sites.34 Indeed, no PTP inhibitors have yet been approved for clinical use despite the clear physiological importance of these enzymes and their complementary activity to the well-established kinase drug targets.35

We have previously reported a series of low molecular weight STEP inhibitors, developed using the substrate activity screening (SAS) approach (Figure 1).36 We have also described benzopentathiepin inhibitors of STEP.37,38 Since then, there has only been one report of STEP inhibitors designed by in silico virtual screening, with similar potencies to our own.39 There has also been a cheminformatic study on drug repurposing, but this report does not provide binding data.40

Herein, we disclose thermodynamic characterization and X-ray crystal structures of inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 bound to STEP, the first structures of STEP inhibitor complexes. Unexpectedly, the inhibitors do not all reside in the same binding pocket on the enzyme—and none of them fully occupy the active site. Furthermore, we have utilized the structural information obtained from these X-ray structures to develop our lead inhibitor with a Ki of 110 nM, representing an improvement in inhibition by nearly two orders of magnitude.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Thermodynamic Characterization of Inhibitors Bound to STEP

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to confirm direct binding of phosphonates 1, 2, and 3 to the STEP phosphatase domain. Titration experiments of the STEP phosphatase domain with the compounds indicate clear target engagement with affinities in the two-digit micromolar range (Table 1). Whilst the related compounds 2 and 3 representing two epimers of the same scaffold show an undistinguishable and enthalpy-driven thermodynamic signature speaking towards a conserved and equivalent binding mode, compound 1 indicates a significantly weaker binding affinity. This change can be mainly attributed to the largely reduced enthalpic contribution when comparing it with 2 and 3, which is only partially compensated by an entropic contribution to the overall binding energy. Combining this with information about the different chemical structures one can postulate a major difference in the binding mode of 1 in comparison with 2 and 3, although such differences in thermodynamic profiles are not necessarily a hallmark for alterations in the ligand interaction or binding mode.41 The multifactorial character of the enthalpy signal together with solvation changes and conformational effects always call for an additional analysis using structural data, as we discuss in the next section.

X-ray Characterization of Inhibitors Bound to STEP

To enable structure-based design with the phosphonate inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 as starting points and to better understand the origin of the thermodynamic differences, crystal structures were generated of these compounds in complex with STEP (Figure 2). Data was collected from cryo cooled crystals soaked overnight in 4–5 mM solution of compound dissolved in DMSO. The structures were subsequently solved by molecular replacement using the previously reported STEP apo structure (PDB 2BV5) as a search model.17 Data processing and refinement statistics can be found in Table S1, and the resulting electron density for the inhibitors in Figure S1. The overall structure of the phosphatase domain is very similar to the apo structures and no major conformational differences are noted in the loops surrounding the catalytic site.

Inhibitor 1 binds in STEP’s active site groove, but surprisingly, its negatively-charged phosphonate head group is nearly 8 Å distant from catalytic Cys472 (Figures 3A, S2A). This result was unexpected insofar as the α-hydroxyphosphonic acid pharmacophore is a non-hydrolyzable phosphate mimetic that might be expected to bind at the same site as the corresponding phosphate substrate.36 Instead, phosphonate 1 rests in a separate but nearby positively-charged pocket, which in the apo structure is occupied by a sulfate ion.17 In a previously described structure of a STEP (C472S) mutant and the substrate phosphotyrosine, the side chain of Arg478 interacts with the phosphate group of the substrate.42 Here, Arg478 adopts a different conformation in order to coordinate one of the phosphonic acid oxygens in compound 1 (Figure S3). Even though the two sites do not overlap, this shift may interfere with the integrity of the active site and thereby reduce substrate affinity. Furthermore the backbone rings of phosphonate 1 curl into a hydrophobic cleft,44 while the phenolic –OH of the central ring does not make specific contact with the enzyme; rather it is solvent exposed.

STEP co-crystal structures were also obtained for inhibitors 2 and 3 (Figure 2B, C). The α-hydroxyphosphonic acid makes several specific, direct hydrogen-bonding contacts to the same positively-charged cavity bound by inhibitor 1 and is distinct from substrate binding. The non-overlapping occupancy of substrate phosphotyrosine and inhibitor 2 in STEP’s active site is depicted in Figure 2D. The phosphonate oxygens in inhibitors 2 and 3 bind to Gln520, Lys439, Trp435, and Arg478, along with water molecules supported by Thr517, Lys439, Gln520, and Gln516 (Figure 3B, S2B). The α-hydroxy substituent of 2 and 3 is also directly involved in this hydrogen-bonding network, which is consistent with the fact that the (S)-configuration of the alcohol stereocenter is necessary for strong inhibition.36

Surprisingly, except for the binding site of the α-hydroxyphosphonic acid pharmacophore, inhibitors 2 and 3 interact with hydrophobic regions of the enzyme that are completely distinct from that observed for inhibitor 1. The unexpected difference in binding mode is in line with the large difference in the thermodynamic profile shown by ITC, although the observed enthalpy gain appears at first sight counterintuitive. Hydrophobic interactions are typically not associated with enthalpy gains due to the hydrophobic effect,41 which in this case speaks towards a more complex protein solvation behavior both within these hydrophobic regions as well as the close vicinity of the α-hydroxyphosphonic acid pharmacophore. The co-crystal structures of 2 and 3 also explain their near identical inhibitory potency despite the opposite stereochemistry of their benzhydryl alcohols. STEP makes the same interactions with inhibitors 2 and 3 and does not make specific contacts to the benzhydryl alcohols, which are solvent exposed.

An overlay of the crystal structures of inhibitors 1 and 2 bound to STEP illustrates their unanticipated, non-coincident binding (Figure 4). Although the two compounds reside in separate shallow, hydrophobic clefts, the phosphonate head groups both align into the same noncatalytic positively-charged pocket. This crystallographic understanding provided essential inspiration for expansion of the inhibitor scaffold into more potent structures (vide infra).

Structure-Based Optimization of STEP Inhibitors

We set out to improve the binding affinity of these phosphonate inhibitors. To avoid stereochemical complications and for ease of synthesis, we elected to begin optimization around the difluorophosphonic acid45 scaffold of inhibitor (±)-4 (Chart 1) rather than the more complex structure of chiral hydroxyphosphonic acids 2 and 3. This highly homologous, previously reported difluorophosphonate has only slightly lower potency than alcohols 2 and 3.36 The use of racemates streamlined synthetic considerations and is justified in that the benzhydryl alcohol does not make specific contacts with the enzyme target or affect activity (see 2 and 3, vide supra).

We first explored alterations to the distal aromatic ring. In the crystal structure, we observed a small, hydrophobic cavity at the ortho-position. Attempting to fill this pocket with a relatively small fluorine-substituent ((±)-5) resulted in a negligible change in potency. However, the larger chlorine substituent ((±)-6) provided a small, but measurable improvement.

This substitution pattern was also tested in achiral phosphonic acids lacking the benzhydryl hydroxyl-group (Chart 2). The trend observed in Chart 1, of decreasing Ki with the presence of larger halogen substitution holds for this series of inhibitors (7–9) as well, and all three are more potent than the parent alcohols. Upon moving to a larger bromine atom (10), we observed a trivial increase in binding affinity, which was not pronounced enough to justify proceeding with the heavier halogen.

Next, we turned to the central aromatic ring. While the hydrogen atoms at the 4-, 5-, and 6-positions all project into solvent, it appeared that we could take advantage of a small hydrophobic surface adjacent to the 2-position. Molecular modeling suggested that fluorine would be an ideal fit for this volume. Indeed, difluorophosphonic acid 11 demonstrated two-fold better potency than inhibitor 9.

At this point, we sought to benchmark our improved inhibitor 11 against α-hydroxyphosphonic acids that more closely resembled the compounds observed in the co-crystal structure (i.e. 2 and 3, vide supra). Restoration of the hydroxyl-group adjacent to the phosphorus atom resulted in a pair of enantiomeric inhibitors ((R)-12 and (S)-12, Chart 3). Consistent with the findings in our previous publication36 and with the X-ray crystal structure of inhibitors 2 and 3, these phosphonic acids exhibit chiral discrimination, with the (S)-enantiomer possessing nearly six-fold higher activity than the (R)-enantiomer. Importantly, hydroxyphosphonic acid (S)-12 was not more potent than the simpler achiral inhibitor 11. However, racemic monofluorophosphonic acid (±)-13 was measurably more active than compound 11.

We then returned to the overlay of the co-crystal structures of inhibitors 1 and 2 bound to STEP (Figure 3B) for further guidance. Speculating that top hits 11 and (±)-13 reside in the same binding pocket as inhibitor 2, we hypothesized that we could build into the space occupied by phosphonic acid 1 if we grafted its first aromatic ring onto our optimized scaffold. Similar linking strategies have been reported by groups at SmithKline Beecham in the context of Cathepsin K inhibitors.50,51 Molecular modeling indicated that this could be successfully accomplished with a phenyl ketone, as in phosphonic acid (±)-14 (Table 2). Indeed, this modification provided a four-fold enhancement in potency over compound 11 and a three-fold enhancement over monofluorophosphonic acid (±)-13.

Saturation of the newly-added ring resulted in a two-fold drop in activity ((±)-15), and moving to the piperidine amide ((±)-16) resulted in a further three-fold diminution in binding affinity. Nonetheless, given the ability of the ketone inhibitors to potentially undergo a reverse phosphono-Claisen condensation, we were motivated to proceed with more stable amide-based inhibitors. We found that we could greatly streamline our syntheses by removal of the α-fluorine substituent ((±)-17) with no appreciable difference in potency (see Chemical Synthesis section for synthetic sequences). Switching from the piperidine amide to the morpholine amide ((±)-18) likely improved solubility and moderately enhanced efficacy. The acyclic dimethyl amide ((±)-19) was comparable in potency to piperidine amide (±)-17, but secondary amide (±)-20 was considerably weaker.

A nearly four-fold jump in activity accompanied the switch from amide (±)-18 to sulfonamide (±)-21, a change that also engendered improved solubility. Given the submicromolar inhibition of STEP demonstrated by racemic inhibitor (±)-21, we wished to assay the individual enantiomers of this compound to test for chiral discrimination. We were unable to resolve the enantiomers of (±)-21, and the protected precursors of this inhibitor were not configurationally stable. However, we were able to access both enantiomers of α-fluorinated analogue 22 (vide infra). The (+)-enantiomer was over 35-fold less potent than the (−)-enantiomer, demonstrating substantial chiral discrimination and supporting the hypothesis that (−)-22 makes direct and specific contacts with the binding pocket.

Given the high structural homology among PTP active sites, we tested (−)-22 against a series of PTPs and the dual-specificity phosphatase MKP5 (Table 3). Notably, this sulfonamide exhibited greater than 40-fold selectivity against all but one (LAR) other phosphatase assayed. Furthermore, in preliminary studies for future in vivo evaluation, (−)-22 was determined to have respectable aqueous solubility (11 μM ± 2 μM, in PBS at pH 7.4) and complete stability to rat plasma over 1 hour as well as excellent stability to rat liver microsomes (88% and 92% remaining after 1 hour with and without NADPH).52

CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS

The preparation of difluorophosphonate inhibitors (±)-5–11 all employed either input 24 or 25 (Scheme 1). Zinc- and CuBr-promoted coupling of diethyl (bromodifluoromethyl) phosphonate with 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene provided phosphonic acid diethyl ester 23.53 This material was then deprotected with iodotrimethylsilane or borylated under Miyaura conditions to provide intermediates 24 and 25, respectively.

Inhibitors (±)-5 and (±)-6 were accessed through a three step process beginning with formation of the Grignard reagent from 3-bromoiodobenzene by transmetallation with isopropylmagnesium iodide followed by addition to the appropriate benzaldehyde (26 or 27) to form alcohols (±)-28 and (±)-29 (Scheme 2a). While the synthesis of 4,5-dichloro-2-fluorobenzaldehyde 26 has been previously reported,54 we approached 2,4,5-trichlorobenzaldehyde 27 by transmetallation of the corresponding 1,2,4-trichloro-5-iodobenzene with isopropylmagnesium iodide followed by addition to DMF (Scheme 2b). Miyaura borylation of aryl bromides (±)-28 and (±)-29 gave the corresponding pinacol boronates (±)-30 and (±)-31. Subsequent Suzuki cross-coupling with phosphonic acid 24 afforded ligands (±)-5 and (±)-6.

The synthesis of inhibitors 8–11 was accomplished through a similar sequence (Scheme 3a). Transmetallation of aryl iodide 32 or 3355 followed by Grignard addition to the appropriate benzaldehyde (26, 27, or 34) provided benzhydryl alcohols (±)-35–(±)-38. Benzaldehyde 34 was prepared through a three step process beginning with the iron-mediated reduction of 1-bromo-4,5-dichloro-2-nitrobenzene to the corresponding aniline (43, Scheme 3b). Sandmeyer reaction of aniline 43 provided iodide 44, which was converted to benzaldehyde 34 through the same process as used above for aldehyde 27. Suzuki cross-coupling of aryl iodides (±)-35–(±)-38 with boronic ester 25 gave phosphonate esters (±)-39–(±)-42, which were then treated with iodotrimethylsilane to concomitantly remove the ethyl ester protecting groups and the benzhydryl hydroxyl-group, to provide the desired phosphonic acids 8–11.

Enantiomerically pure inhibitors (R)-12 and (S)-12 were synthesized using a related set of reactions (Scheme 4). First, transmetallation of 1,2,4-trichloro-5-iodobenzene and addition to 3-bromo-2-fluorobenzaldehyde generated alcohol (±)-45, which was reduced to aryl bromide 46 by triethylsilane in the presence of boron trifluoride. Miyaura borylation to afford boronic ester 47 was followed by Suzuki cross coupling with enantiomercially pure α-hydroxyphosphonic acids (R)-48 and (S)-48 to provide both enantiomers of inhibitor 12.

Monofluorophosphonic acid (±)-13 was prepared in four steps, starting with the α-fluorination of diethyl (4-bromobenzyl)phosphonate using NFSI (Scheme 5).56 The resultant aryl bromide ((±)-49) was treated with bis(pinacoloto)diboron under Miyaura conditions to provide boronate (±)-50. Cross-coupling with the previously described aryl iodide (±)-38 then generated a diastereomeric mixture of benzhydryl alcohols 51. Treatment with iodotrimethylsilane resulted in cleavage of the ethyl esters and loss of the benzhydryl hydroxyl-group to afford inhibitor (±)-13.

We accessed β-ketophosphonates (±)-14 and (±)-15 by first performing an LDA-mediated phosphono-Claisen condensation between diethyl (4-bromobenzyl)phosphonate and the appropriate commercially available ester (52 or 53, Scheme 6).57 This was followed by Miyaura borylation of aryl bromides (±)-54 and (±)-55 to afford pinacol esters (±)-56 and (±)-57, which were subsequently cross-coupled with aryl iodide (±)-38. α-Fluorination of ketones 58 and 59 was accomplished by treatment with a combination of NFSI and selectfluor. Subsequent deprotection and hydrodehydroxylation of 60 and 61 provided inhibitors (±)-14 and (±)-15.

Amide inhibitor (±)-16 was synthesized in five steps, starting with an LDA-promoted amide formation between diethyl (4-bromobenzyl)phosphonate and piperidine-1-carbonyl chloride (62) to generate phosphonate (±)-63 (Scheme 7). Fluorination with LDA and NFSI to provide amide (±)-64 was followed by borylation under standard conditions. Suzuki cross-coupling of boronate (±)-65 with aryl iodide (±)-38 afforded a diastereomeric mixture of amides 66, which was concomitantly deprotected and hydrodehydroxylated with iodotrimethylsilane to provide phosphonate (±)-16.

The synthesis of tertiary amide inhibitors (±)-17–(±)-19 was carried out by first reducing benzhydryl alcohol (±)-38 to the diarylmethane 67 with triethylsilane, and borylating diethyl (4-bromobenzyl)phosphonate to boronate ester 68 (Scheme 8). These two components were subsequently cross-coupled to afford phosphonate 69, which was treated with LDA and the appropriate carbamic chloride (62, 70, or 71). The resultant amides (±)-72–(±)-74 were treated without purification with iodotrimethylsilane to give inhibitors (±)-17–(±)-19.

We approached secondary amide inhibitor (±)-20 in six steps from commercially available methyl 2-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)acetate (Scheme 9). After Suzuki-coupling with aryl iodide 67 in ethanol solvent, we observed partial transesterification of the methyl ester to the ethyl ester, resulting in a trivial mixture of intermediates 75a and 75b, which were hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid (76). α-Bromination under Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky conditions resulted in additional bromination at the benzhydryl position, providing a diastereomeric mixture of acids 77, which was treated with methylamine and CDI to afford amide 78. Arbuzov reaction in neat triethyl phosphite provided phosphonate 79. Exposure to iodotrimethylsilane resulted in removal of the ethyl ester protecting groups and reduction of the benzhydryl bromide to give inhibitor (±)-20.

Inhibitor (±)-21 was produced starting with sulfonamide formation between (4-bromophenyl)methanesulfonyl chloride and morpholine to generate intermediate 80 (Scheme 10). This material was borylated to give 81, which was then cross-coupled with aryl iodide 67 to provide sulfonamide 82. From here, deprotonation with LDA followed by addition of diethyl chlorophosphate58 gave phosphonate (±)-83, which was deprotected with iodotrimethylsilane to afford inhibitor (±)-21. The enantiomers of inhibitor (±)-21 did not separate by preparative chiral chromatography and precursor (±)-83 racemized under separation conditions, due to the highly acidic nature of the α-hydrogen. In order to access enantiomerically pure inhibitors we prepared the α-fluorinated sulfonamides (+)-22 and (−)-22.

Accordingly, sulfonamide 82 was fluorinated with NFSI, to give (±)-84, which was converted to the racemic mixture of α-fluorophosphonates (±)-85 by deprotonation and addition of diethyl chlorophosphate (Scheme 11).58 This racemic mixture was resolved by chiral supercritical fluid chromatography to provide isolated enantiomers 85a and 85b.59 Finally, treatment of the separated isomers with iodotrimethylsilane afforded enantiomeric inhibitors (+)-22 and (−)-22.

CONCLUSIONS

Despite the causative link between STEP overactivity and the hallmark symptoms of AD, only limited progress has been reported on the development of potent and selective inhibitors of this PTP. In this article, we have presented co-crystal structures of our previously reported inhibitors with STEP, displaying a surprising example of non-coincident binding of related compound structures. Furthermore, neither inhibitor scaffold fully resides in the anticipated active site of the enzyme.

We were able to successfully use structural data from the crystal structures in order to iteratively improve our inhibitor design and expand the architecture of one compound to occupy space filled by the other. Ultimately, we identified phosphonate (−)-22 with a Ki of 110 nM. Importantly, this inhibitor exhibited promising selectivity over other tyrosine and dual-specificity phosphatases. The determination of the co-crystal structure of sulfonamide (−)-22 with STEP is a priority for future efforts to further enhance potency and selectivity, and most importantly, to identify suitable replacements for the polar and acidic phosphonic acid functionality as would likely be necessary for target engagement within the CNS.

EXPERIMENTAL

General Methods

Flasks were fitted with rubber septa. Reactions were conducted under air unless noted. Stainless steel syringes were used to transfer air- and moisture-sensitive liquids. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh). Commercial reagents were used as received with the following exceptions: dichloromethane, 1,4-dioxane, and tetrahydrofuran were dried by passing through columns of activated alumina. Diisopropylamine was distilled from NaOH at 760 torr. n-Butyllithium was titrated using N-benzylbenzamide as an indicator. Chemical shifts for protons are reported in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to residual protium in the NMR solvent (CHCl3 = δ 7.27). Chemical shifts for carbon are reported in parts per million downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the carbon resonances of the solvent (CDCl3 = δ 77.0). Data are represented as follows: chemical shift (multiplicity (br = broad, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, quin = quintet, m = multiplet), coupling constants in Hertz (Hz), integration). The mass spectral data were obtained on an Agilent 6550A quadrupole time-of-flight LC/MS spectrometer (ESI-TOF). Enzymatic assays were performed on a Perkin Elmer Envision 2100 plate reader. Synthesis, characterization, and enzymatic assays of inhibitors 1, 2, 3, (±)-4, and 7 have been previously reported.36 The purity of all new inhibitors (≥95%) has been determined by HPLC analysis.

Protein Production for Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and Crystallography

The STEP phosphatase domain (6His-TEV-STEP258-539) DNA was synthesized and cloned by GeneArt Life Technologies and expressed in E. coli (BL21-Gold; DE3) at 18 °C with overnight expression. Frozen E.coli cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, complete protease inhibitor tablets-EDTA free (Roche), 2.5 units/mL Benzonase) using a polytron homogeniser. Cells were lysed using one pass through a Basic Z (Constant Systems) at 25K psi. The cell lysate was then clarified by centrifugation at 25000 x g. The supernatant was loaded onto pre-equilibrated 10 mL Ni NTA Superflow (Qiagen), packed in an XK26 column (GE Healthcare), using an ÄKTA explorer (GE Healthcare). The column was then washed to A280 baseline with load buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5% Glycerol, washed with 50 mM imidazole) and eluted with load buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Samples of the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those containing the protein were pooled. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm throughout. The pool was concentrated (10 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrators, Millipore) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol) High Load Superdex75 16/600 (GE Healthcare). SDS-PAGE was used to pool fractions containing the phosphatase domain. The S75 pool was diluted 4x into anion exchange buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM TCEP, 5% Glycerol) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 6 mL Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed to A280 baseline and eluted with a 5 CV 10% elution buffer (anion exchange buffer + 1M NaCl) step, followed by a 20 CV gradient of 20–50% elution buffer. Fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE. The Q Pool was concentrated as before to 8 mL and loaded onto a Hi Load Superdex 200 26/600 (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with storage buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP). Fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE, aliquoted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at −80 °C.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)

The ITC titration experiments were carried out on a MicroCal ITC-200 system (Malvern Instrument Ltd.) using protein that had been passed through a PD-10 column (GE-Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1mM TCEP, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 and 2% DMSO. Due to the expectation of low affinity and low heat signals, titrations of 52 μM STEP phosphatase domain were conducted at 30 °C by injecting 30x1.2 μL aliquots at a concentration of 1.6 mM of the respective compound with 90 seconds waiting time between subsequent injections. The thermodynamic parameters of the binding were extracted by analysis of the binding isotherms applying a single site binding model (setting the stoichiometry value n to 1 due to low c-value titration) using the Microcal Origin version 7.0 software package, yielding binding enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) and association constant (Ka), from which the dissociation constant KD was calculated (KD=1/Ka)

Crystallization and Structure Determination

Prior to crystallization setup 6His-TEV-STEP258-539 was washed with fresh buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM TCEP) and re-concentrated to 4.9 mg/mL. Crystals were grown at 4 °C in hanging drops using 2 μL of protein and 1 μL of well solution (26–28% PEG3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5, 0.2 M lithium sulfate). Rod like crystals typically appeared after 1–2 days but continued to grow for approximately two weeks. Structure complexes with compounds 1, 2, and 3 were obtained by soaking apo crystals in 28% PEG3350, 0.1 M Bis-tris pH 5.5, 1 mM TCEP and 4–5 mM of compound for 18–26 hours. Crystals were cryo-protected using 20% glycerol and frozen under liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. X-ray diffraction data was collected on a Rigaku A200 CDD detector mounted on a rotating anode (FRE+, Rigaku). Data were integrated and processed using autoPROC.60 The crystals belong to space group P212121 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The structures were solved with molecular replacement using the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2BV5 as search model.17 Structural refinement was carried out using autoBUSTER61 and manual rebuilding was done using Coot.62 Statistics from the integration, scaling and refinement are presented in Table S1. All structure illustrations were prepared using the program Pymol.43 Crystallographic coordinates have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (accession codes: 1: 5OW1, 2: 5OVR, 3: 5OVX).

General Procedure for Determination of Inhibitor Ki

Reaction volumes of 100 μL were used in 96-well plates. An amount of 65 μL of water was added to each well, followed by 5 μL of 20× buffer (1.0 M imidazole, 1.0 M NaCl, 0.2% Triton-X 100, pH 7.0), 10 μL of 10× DTT (50 mM, 5 mM in assay), 5 μL of STEP phosphatase (1 μM, 50 nM in assay), and 5 μL of the appropriate inhibitor dilution in DMSO (with 2-fold serial dilutions). The assay plate was incubated for 5 minutes at 27 °C, at which point the reaction was started by addition of 10 μL of a 10× pNPP substrate (5 mM, 500 μM in assay). The plate was then immediately placed into a spectrophotometric plate reader, and 20 minutes of kinetic data was obtained (405 nm, 27 °C). The initial rate data collected were used for determination of Ki values. For Ki determination, the kinetic values were obtained directly from nonlinear regression of substrate–velocity curves in the presence of various concentrations of inhibitor. Assays were run in at least duplicate. Non-linear regression analysis was accomplished in Prism (GraphPad) using single site competitive inhibition. Dose-response curves for each inhibitor as well as additional information are provided in the Supporting Information.
