MicroRNAs are recognized as important regulators of many facets of physiological brain function while also being implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders. Dysregulation of miR155 is widely reported across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. In previous work, we observed that experimentally validated miR155 gene targets were consistently enriched among genes identified as differentially expressed across multiple brain tissue and disease contexts. In particular, we found that human herpesvirus-6A (HHV-6A) suppressed miR155, recapitulating reports of miR155 inhibition by HHV-6A in infected T-cells, thyrocytes, and natural killer cells. In earlier studies, we also reported the effects of constitutive deletion of miR155 on accelerating the accumulation of Aß deposits in 4-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice. Herein, we complete the cumulative characterization of transcriptomic, electrophysiological, neuropathological, and learning behavior profiles from 4-, 8- and 10-month-old WT and APP/PSEN1 mice in the absence or presence of miR155. We also integrated human post-mortem brain RNA-sequences from four independent AD consortium studies, together comprising 928 samples collected from six brain regions. We report that gene expression perturbations associated with miR155 deletion in mouse cortex are in aggregate observed to be concordant with AD-associated changes across these independent human late-onset AD (LOAD) data sets, supporting the relevance of our findings to human disease. LOAD has recently been formulated as the clinicopathological manifestation of a multiplex of genetic underpinnings and pathophysiological mechanisms. Our accumulated data are consistent with such a formulation, indicating that miR155 may be uniquely positioned at the intersection of at least four components of this LOAD “multiplex”: (i) innate immune response pathways; (ii) viral response gene networks; (iii) synaptic pathology; and (iv) proamyloidogenic pathways involving the amyloid β peptide (Aß).


pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of sporadic dementia and represents a major public health emergency in developed countries worldwide. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive decline accompanied by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid ß-peptide (Aß) deposits and an intracellular tauopathy; i.e., formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Increasingly, neuroinflammation is also regarded as an important feature of AD and, as such, may play a pivotal role in the destruction of synapses[36]. This loss of synapses correlates best with clinical cognitive deficits in humans with AD[20, 76]. The relative importance of direct neurotoxicity due to amyloidosis and/or tauopathy as compared with that of indirect toxicity mediated by proteinopathy-induced toxic inflammogens remains to be clarified.

The use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RNA offers a valuable approach to uncover the transcriptomic networks that might underpin these changes[83] and might also point to novel candidate targets for therapeutic intervention[5, 29, 83]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a family of small (20–24 nucleotides), single-stranded, non-protein coding RNA that bind to the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to regulate translational repression, mRNA cleavage, and decay of transcripts. miRNAs are abundant within the brain[19], and they are recognized as important regulators of many facets of physiological brain function, including neurogenesis[8], and synaptogenesis[69], while also being implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological[9] and neurodegenerative disorders[68].

Dysregulation of miR155 has been widely reported across a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI). miR155 overexpression has been reported in sporadic and familial ALS, and in ALS-mutant SOD1 mice, in which miR155 inhibition ameliorates neuropathology and clinical disease[12]. miR155 overexpression has also been described in PD peripheral blood mononuclear cells[13], and has been shown to mediate α-synuclein induced inflammatory response in in vivo and in vitro PD model systems[78]. Henry et al. reported robust overexpression of miR155 following TBI in mice, and miR155 inhibition post-TBI reduces the neuroinflammatory response and improves clinical recovery[31]. In mice exposed to an experimental model of stroke, a miR155 inhibitor was demonstrated to modulate levels of CCL12, CXCL3, IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, MIP-1α, IL-5, and IL-17 at 14 days after stroke[61]. These temporal changes in inflammogen ligand levels correlated with altered levels of miR155 target proteins SOCS-1, SHIP-1, C/EBP-β, and STAT-3. However, miR155 is not a mediator of all forms of neuroinflammation. e.g., Watson et al. [80] report that although miR155 is upregulated in a vertebrate model of Gaucher disease (GD), its reduction does not mitigate neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration.

Perturbation of miR155 in human AD brain and among a variety of AD model systems has been previously reported, with evidence pointing to miR155 as a regulator of T-cell response in AD[73], as a mediator of inflammation-induced neurogenic dysfunction and apoptosis[81], and as an effector of TREM2-APOE regulation of a microglial neurodegenerative phenotype[41]. Sierksma et al. [70] described increased expression of miR155 in hippocampi from APP/PSEN1 and Tau22 mice and from humans with AD. Guedes et al. [28] reported that early upregulation of miR155 in the 3xTg AD mouse model appears to mediate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, in a meta-analysis of nine AD-related microRNA datasets derived from several peripheral and central tissue types, Chen et al. [16] observed an upregulation of miR155. The upregulation of miR155 in AD models and human AD brain, however, is not universal. In a study of miRNA in dorsolateral prefrontal cortices from 700 patients, Patrick et al. [60] observed differential expression in only three miRNAs, none of which was miR155. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR155 is induced by many, but not all, neurodegenerative and inflammatory neuropathologies and, in some cases, reduction of miR155 levels reduces pathology and improves clinical function. Yet, the role of miR155 remains incompletely understood such that, for any given model or pathology, one cannot predict whether miR155 is likely to be involved, and, if a model or pathology alters the level of miR155, one cannot predict whether there exists a stage of pathology wherein reduction of miR155 will play a pivotal role in pathogenesis.

Our investigation into the potential role of miR155 in AD began with the novel observation that experimentally validated miR155 gene targets were consistently enriched among genes identified as differentially expressed across multiple brain tissue and disease contexts[62]. Subsequent study of miR155 revealed well-established links with viral biology, including perturbation of miR155 by EBV to stabilize viral latency[26], inhibition of miR155 by HHV-6A[14, 64] and encoding of a miR155 functional ortholog by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)[27] and Marek’s Disease Virus[84]. Consideration of these findings catalyzed our efforts to estimate viral abundance in postmortem NGS data collected by the Accelerating Medicine Partnership in AD (AMP-AD), revealing complex, heterogeneous interactions between many viruses and diverse aspects of AD-associated pathobiology[62]. Throughout that study, we observed that HHV-6A suppressed miR155, recapitulating reports of miR155 inhibition by HHV-6A in infected T-cells, thyrocytes[14], and natural killer (NK) cells[64]. Therein, we reported the effects of constitutive deletion of miR155 on accelerating the accumulation of Aß deposits in 4-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice[62].

In the current study, we complete the cumulative characterization of transcriptomic, electrophysiological, neuropathological, and learning behavior profiles from 4-, 8- and 10-month-old WT and APP/PSEN1 mice in the absence or presence of miR155. Importantly, we also incorporate human post-mortem brain RNA-sequences from four independent AD consortium studies, together comprising 928 samples collected from six brain regions. We report that gene expression perturbations associated with miR155 deletion in mouse cortex are in aggregate observed to be concordant with AD-associated changes across these independent human LOAD data sets, supporting the relevance of our findings to human disease. AD has recently been formulated as a multiplex of disease mechanisms [71]. Our accumulated data are consistent with such a formulation, indicating that miR155 may be positioned at a point where several components of a multiplex of AD pathogenic mechanisms intersect (i.e., innate immune response components, viral response gene networks, synaptic pathology, and proamyloidogenic pathways involving Aß).

Methods

Animals

The experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with NIH guidelines for animal research and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. All mice were on a C57Bl6/J background. APPKM670/671NL/PSEN1Δexon9 (=APP/PSEN1)[35], and miR155 knockout (miR155−/−)[77] were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. APP/PSEN1 were crossed with miR155−/− mice to obtain WT, miR155+/−, miR155−/−, APP/PSEN1, APP/PSEN1;miR155+/−, and APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice. Male mice were used for immunohistochemistry, electrophysiological, behavioral, and transcriptomic analyses. Males and females were used for the quantification of microglia number, Thioflavin-S positive areas, and western blot analyses (suppl. material). If applicable, the use of both sexes is specified in the figure legends. 4- and 8-month-old mice were sacrificed by decapitation. One hemisphere was collected and immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry analysis. The other hemisphere was dissected and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was collected for transcriptomic analysis. PFC and hemibrain were snap-frozen and stored at −80°C prior to RNA isolation or biochemistry analysis.

RNA isolation

Snap frozen samples from the PFC of 4- and 8-month-old WT, miR155+/−, miR155−/−, APP/PSEN1, APP/PSEN1;miR155+/− and APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− or entorhinal cortex (EC) and dentate gyrus (DG) of 12 month-old APP/PSEN1 male mice were homogenized in QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA purification was performed with the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quantification and quality were evaluated by Agilent BioAnalyzer. RNA integrity was checked using the RNA 6000 Nano assay (Agilent, CA, USA). All processed RNA samples had an RQN/RIN value of 8.0 or higher.

RT-qPCR

Aliquots of total RNA (1µg) were reversed transcribed using the qScript™ microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). qPCR was performed in a StepOne Plus system (Applied Biosystem) using the All-in-One qPCR Mix (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD, USA). qPCR consisted of 40 cycles, 10s at 95 °C, 15s at 60 °C, and 15s at 70 °C each, followed by dissociation curve analysis. Ct values were normalized to the expression level of RNU6 and relative gene expression was calculated using the ΔΔCt method [50]. Sequences of primers used: mmu-miR-155–5p: Fwd 5’-TGCTAATTGTGATAGGGGTAAAAA-3’; RNU6: Fwd 5’-GCAAATTCGTGAAGCGTTCC-3’; Universal primer 5’-GCATAGACCTGAATGGCGGTA-3’.

miRNA probe construction

MIR155 DNA oligonucleotide template was designed using Primer 3 software (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/). Palindromic sequences were omitted using palindromic sequence finder (http://biophp.org/minitools/find_palindromes/demo.php), and sequence combinations stretching across exon-exon boundaries were omitted, (CTGTTAATGCTAATCGTGATAGGGG-TTTTTGCCTCCAACTGACTCCTAC-ATATTAGCATT). Both sequences required the addition of an eight-nucleotide sequence to the 3’ end of the oligonucleotide (5’- TTTTTGCCTCCAACTGACTCCTAC-CCTGTCTC-3”). Sense probes were constructed as negative controls and as described above. The mRNA probes for sense and anti-sense were constructed following the manufacturer’s instructions, using the mirVana miRNA Probe Construction Kit (Applied Biosystems).

In situ hybridization

Hippocampal brain sections (20µm) were mounted onto plus slides and allowed to dry overnight. Sections were immersed in 0.007% pre-warmed 600 mAU/ml solution of proteinase K (Qiagen) for 3 min at 37°C. Sections were then washed in DEPC ddH2O followed by the addition of 125µl acetic anhydride in 0.1M TEA. After incubating for 15 min at RT, sections were washed in 2X SSC (saline sodium citrate). Sections were then incubated at 42°C in pre-hybridization solution (20% 20X SSC (Ambion), 2% 50X Denhardt’s (Sigma), 5mg CHAPS per 5mL final volume (Sigma), 2% 25mg/ml yeast tRNA (Invitrogen), 5% salmon sperm 10mg/ml (Invitrogen), 50% formamide/16% dextran (Sigma), 20.8% RNase free ddH2O (Gibco)) for 4h. Sections were rinsed in 2X SSC buffer followed by the addition of RNA-specific biotinylated mRNA probe in hybridization solution (20% 20X SSC, 2% 50X Denhardt’s, 0.005g CHAPS, 2% 25mg/ml yeast tRNA, 5% salmon sperm 10mg/ml, 50% Formamide, 20.8% RNAse free ddh2o). Sections and biotinylated probes were incubated for 16h at 42°C in a humid chamber. After incubation, slides were washed in 4X SSC followed by 30min incubation with 50% formamide/2X SSC at 42°C. Sections were then rinsed in 2X SSC, incubated in 100 ug/ml RNase A solution for 1h at 37°C, washed in 2X SSC, and incubated in 0.5X SSC at 42°C for 30 min, 0.1X SSC at 50°C for 30 min, and 0.1X SSC at RT for 10min. For tissue staining, samples were treated as above, with the exception that streptavidin-conjugated secondary antibodies were employed to detect the biotinylated probes.

Immunohistochemistry

30 µm thick brain sagittal free-floating sections were pre-treated with 70% formic acid for 15min. Sections were blocked for 1h (10% goat serum, PBS, 0.3% Triton-X-100) and incubated overnight at 4°C with either 6E10 (1:1000; cat# 9320–500, Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA), anti-Iba1 (1:500; cat# 019–19741, Wako, Richmond, VA, USA), or anti-GFAP (1:1000; cat#ab4674, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies (1% goat serum, PBS, 0.1% Tween-20 =PBS-T). Sections were washed (PBS-T) and incubated for 1h with fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies (1% goat serum, PBS-T) (anti-mouse Alexa 594 for 6E10 (1:400, cat#A-11005, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA), anti-rabbit Alexa 488 for Iba1 (1:400, cat#A-11008, Thermo Fisher Scientific), or anti-chicken Alexa 488 for GFAP (1:400, cat#A-11039, Thermo Fisher Scientific)). For Thioflavin-S labeling, 30 µm thick sagittal sections were mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (cat#12–550-15, Fisher Scientific), rehydrated, and incubated with freshly prepared 1% Thioflavin-S (Sigma-Aldrich, T1892) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Sections were then washed 2×3min with 80% ethanol, 2×3min with 95% ethanol, and 3×5min with water, and coverslipped with Vectashield Hardset (cat# H-1400, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired using an Olympus BX61 microscope, an Axio Imager Z2M (Zeiss, Pleasanton, CA, USA), or a Pannoramic 250 digital scanner (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary).

Percentages of ThioS and 6E10-immunoreactive areas were calculated using Fiji software (v2.0.0). Images were thresholded and binarized using the IsoData algorithm, and the percentage of positive areas in the region of interest (ROI) was calculated using the “measure” function. Values were expressed as percentage of the control group. For measuring sizes of 6E10 immunoreactive plaques in the hippocampus, plaques were outlined by manually tracing in Fiji software (v2.0.0), and the area of each plaque was calculated using the “measure” function. To quantify the number of microglial cells, Iba1 positive cells in ROI were manually counted and numbers were normalized to the area of the ROI. Fluorescent intensities for GFAP and Iba1 staining were analyzed with Fiji software (v2.0.0) and expressed as percentage of the control group.

Aß assays

Samples were processed as described[29, 39, 40]. Briefly, hemibrains from 8 month-old APP/PSEN1, APP/PSEN1;miR155+/− or APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− were processed via differential detergent solubilization to produce TBS-soluble, Triton-X-100 soluble and formic-acid soluble Aβ fractions. To quantify total Aβ levels, human/rat Aβ 1–40/1–42 ELISA kits (Wako, Richmond, VA) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Absolute concentrations of Aβ were normalized to initial tissue weight.

Western blotting

Aliquots of protein lysates (30 µg) prepared from hemibrains homogenized in RIPA buffer were loaded in Criterion XT 4–20% Bis-Tris gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane (0.45μm; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were probed with anti-6E10 (1:2000, cat#9320–500, Covance, Princeton, NJ, USA), anti-Synapsin-1 (1:1000, cat#106103, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), and anti-PSD-95 (1:1000, cat#MAB1596, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) antibodies and subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000, cat#PI-1000 or PI-2000, Vector laboratories). Normalization was achieved using GAPDH antibody (1:5000, cat#sc32233, Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Membranes were developed with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using the Fujifilm LAS-3000 developer (Stamford, CT, USA). Integrated density of immunoreactive bands was measured using Fiji software (ImageJ).

Field electrophysiology

Coronal brain slices containing the hippocampal formation were prepared as previously described[24, 29, 30]. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and brains were rapidly removed from the skull and placed in an ice-cold modified ACSF solution containing: 215mM sucrose, 2.5mM KCl, 1.6mM NaH2PO4, 4mM MgSO4, 1mM CaCl2, 4mM MgCl2, 20mM glucose, 26mM NaHCO3 (pH= 7.4). Coronal brain slices (400µm thick) were incubated at room temperature for ≥ 3h in a physiologic ACSF, containing: 120mM NaCl, 3.3mM KCl, 1.2mM Na2HPO4, 26mM NaHCO3, 1.3mM MgSO4, 1.8mM CaCl2, 11mM glucose (pH=7.4 equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). Hemi-slices were transferred to a recording chamber perfused with ACSF at a flow rate of ~2 mL/min using a peristaltic pump. Experiments were performed at 28.0 ± 0.1°C. Recordings were acquired with a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). All signals were low-pass filtered at 2kHz and digitized at 10kHz. Field recordings were obtained using a patch-type pipette filled with ACSF and placed in the middle third of stratum radiatum in area CA1. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were evoked by activating the Shaffer collaterals (SCs) with a concentric bipolar electrode (FHC) placed in the middle third of stratum radiatum, 150–200µm away from the recording pipette (Figure 2a). Square-wave current pulses (60ms pulse width) were delivered through a constant-current stimulus isolator (Isoflex, AMPI). Input-output curves were generated by a series of stimuli ranging from 30–80µA. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was measured by delivering two stimuli at 20, 50, and 100ms interstimulus intervals. Each interstimulus interval was repeated three times and the resulting potentials were averaged. The paired-pulse ratio was calculated by dividing the slope of the second EPSP by the slope of the first EPSP. Baseline recordings (stable for 20min) were made every 30s using stimuli that yielded a response equal to 50% of spike threshold. For long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) experiments, synaptic strength was measured by EPSP slope with stimuli that yielded a response equal to 30–40% of spike threshold, delivered every 30s. LTP was induced after 20min of stable baseline recording with theta-burst stimulation (TBS), consisting of a series of 10 bursts of 4 stimuli (100Hz within the burst, 200ms interburst interval) repeated 4 times (10 s apart) and delivered at an intensity giving a baseline response equal to 75% of spike threshold. LTD was induced after 20min of stable baseline recordings by bath application of (RS)-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; 100µM), a selective mGluR 1/5 agonist, for 5min. fEPSPs were collected for at least 60min during DHPG washout.

Barnes maze

The Barnes Maze test [4, 75] consists of a rotatable circular platform (1.22m in diameter and 1m from the floor) with 20 holes in the periphery. A removable box was placed underneath one of the holes for escape, and visual cues were placed on the walls of the room. Mice were transported from their cages to the center of the platform via a closed starting chamber where they remained for 10s prior to exploring the maze for 3min. Mice failing to enter the escape box within 3min were guided to the escape box by the experimenter, and the latency was counted as 180s. Mice were allowed to remain in the escape box for 1 min before the next trial. 2 trials per day were performed on 4 consecutive days. The platform and the escape box were wiped with 70% ethanol after each trial to eliminate the use of olfactory cues to locate the target hole. All trials were recorded by a video camera and analyzed with ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, USA).

RNA sequencing

Total RNAs from PFC of 4- and 8-month-old male WT (n=4), miR155+/− (n=4), miR155−/−(n=4), APP/PSEN1 (n=4), APP/PSEN1;miR155+/− (n=4) or APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− (n=4) mice were subjected to RNA sequencing. The sequencing library was prepared with the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 protocol (Illumina, CA, USA). Ribosomal RNAs were removed using the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat) (Illumina, CA, USA). Remaining RNAs were fragmented, and the cDNAs synthesized using random hexamers, end-repaired, and ligated with appropriate adaptors for sequencing. The library was processed for size selection and purification using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The appropriate Illumina-recommended 6bp barcode bases were introduced at one end of the adaptors during the PCR amplification step. The size and concentration of the RNA-seq libraries were measured by Bioanalyzer and Qubit fluorometry (Life Technologies, NY, USA) before loading onto the sequencer. The rRNA-depleted libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 System with 100 nucleotide single-end reads (Illumina, CA, USA).

Mouse RNA-sequence read alignment and differential gene expression analysis

Single-end fastq files for 48 mouse cortical samples were aligned to the Mus musculus Ensembl Reference genome (GRCm38.p5, Version 91)[82], using Kallisto[11]. Transcript alignments were imported and summarized to gene-level counts using tximport[72]. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. Mouse gene identifiers were converted to available human orthologs using the Mouse Genome Database[23].

Molecular and functional enrichment analysis

Gene set enrichments for DEG signatures were calculated using Fisher’s exact test, and one-sided P-values (to identify over-representation of gene sets) were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method[6]. Gene sets used throughout the enrichment analysis were derived from a combination of publicly available sources, such as the Harmonizome collection[66], molecular signatures database[74], brain-specific gene sets curated from publicly available data[54], protein-protein hubs interactor sets[15], miRTarBase[33], and ChipSeq based transcription factor target sets[42].

miR155 DEG enrichments among human postmortem brain gene expression

RNA sequencing data were obtained from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership - Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD) Knowledge Portal (MSSB synapse ID: syn8612191, MAYO TCX: syn8466816, ROS/MAP: syn3505720). For the MSBB cohort, post-mortem samples were collected from the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG, Brodmann Area 22), Anterior Prefrontal Cortex (APFC, Brodmann Area 10), Parahippocampal Gyrus (PHG, Brodmann Area 36) and Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG, Brodmann Area 44) by the Mount Sinai NIH Brain and Tissue Repository. MAYO TCX cohort samples were collected from the temporal cortex, as previously described[1]. ROS and MAP cohort samples were collected from the DLPFC as previously described[7, 8].

For gene expression within the MSSB cohort, single-end reads were aligned to human genome reference (GRCh37 Ensembl version 70[38]), using STAR-RNAseq (2.4.0g1) read aligner[22], and accepted mapped reads were summarized to gene level counts using the featureCounts function of the subread software package[45, 46]. Genes with at least 1 count per million mapped reads[65] in at least half of the sample libraries were retained, and normalized using the voom function in the Limma package[44, 63]. For gene expression within the ROS and MAP cohorts, data was available as gene FPKM estimates. We retained genes with non-zero FPKM in at least half of the sample libraries, and log2 transformed FPKM values after incrementing an offset of 0.5 to avoid transformation of zero values. MAYO TCX gene expression was downloaded as log2 transformed counts per million.

Within the MSBB, ROS, and MAP cohorts, definitions of AD were based on CERAD neuropathology classification[55], specifically we retained samples from subjects classified as “Definite AD” and “Controls”. Diagnosis within the MAYO TCX cohort was based on neuropathological evaluation and classification, in particular “AD” was based on “Definite AD” diagnosis according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria and a Braak NFT stage of IV or greater. Control subjects had Braak NFT stage of &lt;= III, CERAD neuritic and cortical plaque densities of 0 (none) or 1 (sparse) and the absence of any of the following pathologic diagnoses: AD, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, vascular dementia, PSP, motor neuron disease, corticobasal degeneration, Pick’s disease, Huntington’s disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, hippocampal sclerosis, or dementia lacking distinctive histology.

For each cohort/tissue combination, we subset normalized gene expression to contain only “AD Definite” and “Control” samples, and then used GAGE[52] to calculate whole-transcriptome enrichments of each miR-155 DEG set comparison between “AD Definite” and “Control” sample groups. Enrichments were calculated using settings same.dir=TRUE, saaTest=gs.tTest, and compare=‘unpaired’.

AD GWAS enrichments for DEG cis-eQTLs

We identified cis-acting (&lt;1MB) DNA markers that associate with gene expression (cis-eQTL) separately for each brain region. Within each region, we included data from donors with paired whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing data. We used the Matrix eQTL[67] software package to identify DNA variants associated with normalized gene expression (controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, RNA-sequencing batch, RIN, and PMI as covariates), assuming an additive linear model for associating genotype dosage with gene expression. We classified DNA markers with an association FDR&lt;0.1 as cis-eQTL, and used these to define the set of markers that are collectively associated with each DEG signature. We subdivided each DEG signature into upregulated, and downregulated components and then calculated enrichments for AD risk-associated loci[43] using the versatile gene-based association study (VEGAS) approach[49, 56].

Results

Absence of miR155 increases Aß deposition in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice.

We previously reported an increased number of 6E10 immunoreactive plaques in the cortex of 4-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice[62]. Here, we evaluated the amyloid pathology in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice in the presence or absence of miR155. Consistent with our previous report, 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice demonstrated an increased percentage of 6E10 immunoreactive plaques in the cortex and hippocampus (CA1, DG, and total hippocampus) (Figure 1a–b). We observed that the 6E10 immunoreactive deposits in the 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice are also of increased size (Figure 1c). We also confirmed the increased Aß deposition in the cortex and hippocampus of 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice using Thioflavin S staining (ThioS) (Figure 1h–i). We observed an increased percentage of ThioS- labeled positive areas in the cortex and hippocampus of 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice compared with APP/PSEN1 mice.

We assessed whether the absence of miR155 modulates levels of Aß species in APP/PSEN1 mice. We measured levels of Aß40 and Aß42 in TBS, Triton-X, and formic acid soluble Aß fractions from the brains of 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 and APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice. Absence of miR155 did not significantly alter the levels of Aß40 or Aß42 in any of the three fractions as compared to those observed in APP/PSEN1 mice (Table 1). Aß42/40 ratios in TBS-or Triton-X fractions were not affected by the absence of miR155. However, the relatively minor effect size notwithstanding, Aß42/40 ratio was reduced in the absence of miR155 in the formic acid fraction (Table 1). The level of human APP holoprotein was unchanged in both the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− and APP/PSEN1;miR155+/− mice relative to APP/PSEN1 mice (Supplementary Figure S1).

Absence of miR155 does not modify the activation of microglia or astrocytes in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice.

Given the increased Aß deposition in the brain of APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice, the pivotal role of glial cells and neuroinflammation in Aß deposition, and the recent evidence pointing to miR155 as a mediator of the TREM2-APOE induced microglial neurodegenerative phenotype conversion [41], we assessed the effect of the absence of miR155 on microgliosis and astrogliosis in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice (Figure 1d–g, j–k). In the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice, we did not observe any changes in the number or the fluorescent intensity of Iba1 immunostained microglia in the cortex or of plaque recruited microglia. (Figure 1d–g). Similarly, in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice, we did not find changes in the fluorescent intensity of the GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus, or of GFAP positive cells recruited in the cortex (Figure 1j, k). We evaluated the protein levels of pre- and postsynaptic markers in the brain of the WT, APP/PSEN1, and APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice. While the levels of the postsynaptic marker PSD95 were statistically unchanged in the 8-month-old WT, APP/PSEN1;miR155−/−, and APP/PSEN1;miR155+/− mice, we observed that levels of the presynaptic marker Synapsin-1 tended to decrease in the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice compared with APP/PSEN1 mice (p=0.0656) (Supplementary Figure S1).

Constitutive deletion of miR155 partially rescues synaptic plasticity in 10 month-old APP/PSEN1 mice but induces synaptic dysfunction in WT mice.

We probed hippocampal slices to determine the effect of miR155 deletion on the synaptic plasticity of 10-month-old APP/PSEN1 and WT mice (Figure 2a). We observed a trend toward an impaired basal transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses in the APP/PSEN1 mice as compared with that of WT mice (Figure 2b). Interestingly, deletion of miR155 in the absence of amyloid pathology (miR155−/−) impaired the basal transmission and did not differ from that of the APP/PSEN1 mice. Surprisingly, however, deletion of miR155 in APP/PSEN1 mice restored normal basal synaptic transmission to that of WT mice, i.e. corrected the APP/PSEN1 deficit. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF), a short term form of presynaptic plasticity, was depressed in 10-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice and was partially rescued by the deletion of miR155 in APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice (Figure 2c). Absence of miR155 in the WT background (miR155−/−) did not affect the PPF, which was not different from WT mice.

We also studied two long-term forms of synaptic plasticity, i.e. the synaptically-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and the DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD). We observed a trend toward impaired LTP in 10-month-old APP/PSEN1 vs. WT mice and the deletion of miR155 in the APP/PSEN1 mice (APP/PSEN1;miR155−/−) rescued this impairment (Figure 2d). As observed for the basal transmission, deletion of miR155 alone, in the absence of amyloid pathology, induced a defect in LTP similar to that observed in APP/PSEN1 mice. LTD was reduced in APP/PSEN1 mice as compared with that of WT mice and this deficit was not rescued by deletion of miR155 in APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice (Figure 2e). Similar to basal transmission and LTP, absence of miR155 in the WT background (miR155−/−) tended to impair the LTD.

Constitutive absence of miR155 prevents impaired performance in Barnes maze learning behavior in 4- and 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice.

We probed the effect of the absence of miR155 on spatial learning behavior using the Barnes Maze Test in 4- and 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 and WT mice (Figure 3a). At both ages, APP/PSEN1 mice showed impaired learning behavior relative to WT mice. At 4-month-old, APP/PSEN1 mice presented an increased latency to enter the hidden zone vs. WT mice (Figure 3b) and an increased latency to find the hidden zone as compared to WT mice at 8-month-old (Figure 3c). APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice at both ages demonstrated improved learning and memory relative to APP/PSEN1. Thus, the latency to enter or find the hidden zone were similar in APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− and WT mice at 4- and 8-month-old. miR155−/− mice did not demonstrate any alterations in their learning behavior. These data suggest a beneficial effect of miR155 deletion upon learning in the presence of APP/PSEN1 mutations.

Transcriptomic effects of miR155 deletion on prefrontal cortex transcriptome.

To investigate the effects of miR155 perturbation on gene expression in the mouse cortex, we performed RNA-sequencing on 48 samples of prefrontal cortex (PFC) from mice aged 4, and 8 months old (n=24 per time point). Our goal was to compare with wildtype (WT) strains, as well as to examine the effects of miR155 deletion on transcription in APP/PSEN1 mice. We thus separately profiled six mouse genotypes (WT, APP/PSEN1, miR155+/−, miR155−/−, APP/PSEN1;miR155+/−, APP/PSEN1;miR155−/−) at each time point (n=4 samples per group), estimated transcript abundance using Kallisto[11] and performed differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2[51].

We observed differentially expressed genes (DEG, FDR&lt;0.1) in all comparisons examined, though we found substantial variability in the quantity of DEG discovered across comparisons (Figure 4a, Supplementary Table S1). Overall, we observed higher quantities of DEG in the 4-month-old mice, particularly for the miR155−/− vs. WT (n=565 genes) and APP/PSEN1 vs. WT (n=539 genes) comparisons. We generally observed minor DEG changes in WT and APP/PSEN1 mice heterozygous KO for miR155 (miR155+/− and APP/PSEN1;miR155+/−) suggesting the absence of a strong dose-dependent effect of miR155 loss on the cerebrocortical transcriptome.

We observed a small number of genes that were classified as DEG with remarkably high or low fold-changes (i.e., absolute log2FC&gt;20). To understand whether these results were truly informative, we visually inspected the boxplots of normalized gene expression across samples for the gene under consideration. In each case (Supplementary Figure S2), the results arose from circumstances in which one of the comparison groups did not have any detectable expression of the gene under consideration, with at least a subset of the remaining group demonstrating some expression. Although these findings may indicate meaningful differences in patterns of qualitative gene expression, given that our studies include some group sizes of n=4, we cannot exclude the possibility that such differences may represent stochastic variation.

To understand the biological context of identified DEG signatures, we generated molecular functional enrichments against a series of publicly available gene set libraries (Supplementary Table S2). In the 4-month-old miR155−/− vs. WT DEG signature (Figure 4b), we observed strong downregulation of several eukaryotic initiation factors (EIF), ribosomal, and mitochondrial pathways (Figure 4c). We also observed downregulation of KEGG pathways for several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, PD, and Huntington’s disease (HD).

Transcriptomic similarity of DEG signatures from miR155 knockout mice vs. APP/PSEN1 transgenic mice.

To understand potential similarities in the effects of each examined genotype on transcription within the PFC, we compared all pairs of DEG signatures (Figure 4a). We observed an unexpectedly large overlap between the 4 month miR155−/− vs. WT, and APP/PSEN1 vs. WT, with 296 shared DEG between the comparisons. Of these 296 genes, we found a strong positive correlation between the logged expression fold change across both comparisons (Pearson’s Correlation, Cor: 0.76, P-value: 2e-16), and complete concordance of valence in the set of 296 genes across each comparison (Figure 4d). Although these genes did include some genes with clear links to AD pathogenesis (e.g., the MS4A6A locus that is upregulated in both genotypes as compared with WT control mice), we did not identify strong enrichments for biological pathways that directly implicate APP processing. Gene set enrichments generated on these 296 shared DEG (Figure 4e) indicated strong downregulation of ribosomal, protein translation, and EIF pathways. We also observed enrichments for CD34+ hematopoiesis stem-cell progenitor gene sets among the up and downregulated components of the shared DEG. This may indicate that both APP/PSEN1 and miR155−/− genotypes lead to some form of proteinopathy, but only the APP/PSEN1 perturbation leads to cerebral and cerebrovascular Aβ amyloidosis.

Comparison of miR155 deletion at 4 and 8 months old.

To understand how transcriptomic changes of each genotype compare across time, we examined the extent of overlap between identified DEG at 4 months and 8 months (Supplementary Figure S3a). We only detected a single gene (BTG Anti-Proliferation Factor 3, BTG3) that was differentially expressed (downregulated) in the miR155−/− vs. WT at both 4, and 8 months old. BTG3 was also downregulated in the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1 comparisons at both time points (Supplementary Figure S3b). We did not observe BTG downregulation in any of the miR155+/− comparisons, so its perturbation may require a complete loss of miR155 expression. BTG3 is anti-proliferative regulator, directly downstream from activated p53[59], with a deletion in normal cells reported to induce cellular senescence[47]. BTG3 proteolytically cleaves Aß42 into several fragments, particularly the Aß11–29 fragment, reportedly essential for Aß42 aggregation.

Understanding interactions between APP metabolism and miR155 deletion.

Given the loss of synaptic function observed in miR155−/− vs. WT mice at 10 months, coupled with the partial rescue of synaptic function and learning in APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1, we were interested in exploring the molecular underpinnings of this apparent APP/PSEN1 dependent effect of miR155 deletion. We observed 51 DEGs in 4-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1 (Figure 5a), and 11 DEG in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1 (Supplementary Table S1). Although the majority of identified DEGs were predicted gene models, without a known human ortholog, we identified several genes that might inform our understanding of interactions between Aß and miR155. In the 4-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1 DEGs, we observed a downregulation of Spectrin Beta, Non-Erythrocytic 2 (SPTBN2), a subunit of neuronal actin cytoskeleton[48], regulator of glutamate signaling[34], and a driver of cortical and cerebellar neurodegeneration[3]. We also observed downregulation of Alkaline Phosphatase, Biomineralization Associated (ALPL), reported to be elevated in brain and plasma in AD[79], and inversely correlated with cognitive status amongst AD patients[37]. In the 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice vs. APP/PSEN1 mice, we observed downregulation of LFNG O-Fucosylpeptide 3-Beta-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LFNG) a glycosyltransferase that regulates NOTCH1 activity[32], and binds to oligomeric Aß[58]. As described above, we also observed a downregulation of BTG3 at both 4 and 8 months of age. Gene set enrichments generated from these 51 DEG (Figure 5b) indicated biological themes of “abnormal nervous system physiology”, “NCAM signaling for neurite outgrowth”, and canonical pathways for “Alzheimer’s Disease”.

miR155 is upregulated in the dentate gyrus of APP/PSEN1 mice.

Given our observation that miR155 deletion improved synaptic physiology in the hippocampal slices of APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice at 10 months of age, we hypothesized that miR155 may be elevated in the hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 mice. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on the dentate gyrus (DG), and entorhinal cortex (EC) of 12-month-old APP/PSEN1 and WT mice (Figure 5c, APP/PSEN1 n=8, WT n=4). We found that miR155 was upregulated in the DG (Mann-Whitney test, P-value&lt;0.02), but not the EC (Mann-Whitney test, P-value&lt;0.35). Elevated microgliosis within the DG, as compared with the EC, may account for this regional difference in miR155 differential expression. This finding is broadly consistent with the findings of Sierksma et al. [70] that miR155 is upregulated in the hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 mice, and is suggestive that miR155 is a molecular mediator of the effects of APP/PSEN1 upon synaptic function within the dentate gyrus.

miR155 is upregulated in the CA1 hippocampus of human AD subjects compared with age-matched controls.

Our observation that miR155 is upregulated in the hippocampus of APP/PSEN1 mice, combined with the finding that deletion of miR155 confers a beneficial effect upon learning behavior in APP/PSEN1 mice, is consistent with miR155 acting as a molecular mediator of the effects of APP/PSEN1 on learning. However, whether miR155 is upregulated in the brains of human subjects with late-onset AD is not clear, with mixed findings reported[16, 60, 70]. We performed in situ hybridization on postmortem CA1 hippocampal tissue from 11 subjects (AD Definite: n=7, Controls: n=4, Figure 5d; Supplementary Table S3) to determine the abundance and cellular localization of miR155. For each subject, we subdivided the CA1 hippocampus into 3 sections, which were then submitted to bright field intensity analysis. We observed significantly higher average section intensity in AD subjects compared with controls (Figure 5e, T-statistic: 2.73, P-value: 0.033), and notably, observed in both AD and control samples that miR155 was predominantly localized within neurons, rather than glial cells.

miR155 deletion downregulates genes in a neuronal subpopulation that is lost in subjects with neuropathology.

Although bulk RNA-sequencing performed on cortical tissue can be informative, inferring the most relevant cell subtypes that are affected within an experiment can be challenging. We sought to integrate our detected DEG with a recent single-nucleus transcriptomic study of human post mortem brain tissue from 48 subjects with AD as well as healthy controls[53] to better understand the cell type fractions that may be most affected by miR155 deletion. We found that several DEG comparisons connected strongly with a variety of cell subpopulation markers (Figure 6a). Most notably, we found that within the DEG of the 4 month miR155−/− vs. WT, there was a significant downregulation of marker genes that characterize excitatory neuronal subpopulations (Ex6 and Ex11 clusters), and upregulation of marker genes that characterize astrocytes (Ast3). The most significant overlap was with Ex6, which was described by Mathys et al. [53] as defining a neuronal population that was enriched within subjects without neuropathology or cognitive impairment. This may indicate that miR155 deletion is associated with the loss of a neuronal subpopulation that is observed in healthy subjects but lost in AD. We also observed that genes upregulated within the 8 month-old APP/PSEN1 vs. WT were significantly enriched in marker genes for several microglial subpopulations, including human AD-associated microglia subpopulation Mic1 [53]. This suggests that although we detected considerable transcriptome-wide concordance between APP/PSEN1 and miR155 at 4 months of age, there are likely to be substantial differences in affected cellular populations between these groups.

miR155 deletion induces AD-like brain transcriptomic changes across multiple AD cohorts.

To understand how the transcriptomic changes induced by miR155 deletion in mice may correspond with those seen in brain tissue of human subjects with AD, we integrated our DEG signatures with RNA-sequence data generated by AMP-AD. We incorporated post-mortem brain RNA-sequences from four independent consortium studies including data from the (1) Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB, Supplementary Table S4), (2) Religious Orders Study[47] (ROS, Supplementary Table S5), (3) Memory and Aging Project[7, 8] (MAP, Supplementary Table S6), and (4) Mayo Temporal Cortex[1] (MAYO TCX, Supplementary Table S7). These data together comprised 928 samples collected from six brain regions. For each of the six tissues assayed across the four cohorts (seven combinations in total), we obtained normalized gene expression data and examined whether DEG signatures were collectively up or downregulated in AD compared with unaffected controls using a gene set enrichment analysis approach (Figure 6b)[52].

We observed a very consistent set of enrichments relating 4 month miR155−/− vs. WT DEG to AD-associated transcriptomic changes. We found that genes downregulated in this DEG signature were significantly negatively enriched (FDR&lt;0.1) in six of the seven post-mortem comparisons, and conversely, we observed that genes upregulated in this DEG signature were significantly positively enriched in five of the seven post-mortem comparisons. Overall, this suggests that gene expression perturbations associated with miR155 deletion are in aggregate observed to be concordant with AD-associated changes in several independent data sets, and brain tissue contexts.

miR155 deletion upregulates AD risk associated expression quantitative trait loci.

To investigate the broader context of how miR155 deletion in mouse cortical tissue might overlap with AD genetic risk, we integrated cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) with AD GWAS summary statistics (Figure 6c–f). Our approach was to use cis-eQTL identified in any of four brain tissues within the MSBB[62], to define the set of markers that are collectively associated with the DEG within each comparison, and then determine whether these DEG eQTLs are enriched for AD risk-associated loci[43] using the versatile gene-based association study (VEGAS) approach[49, 56]. We observed that the genes upregulated in the comparison of 4-month-old miR155−/− vs. WT and APP/PSEN1 vs. WT were most strongly enriched for AD risk associated cis-eQTL (Figure 6f). This suggests that loci that alter the expression of genes that are perturbed by miR155 (or the human APP/PSEN1 transgenes) are in aggregate associated with AD risk, thus supporting the relevance of miR155 dysregulation in human AD.

Discussion

This study describes the effects of miR155 deletion on learning behavior, neuropathology, and cortical transcriptomic phenotypes in control (WT) and APP/PSEN1 mice at 4, 8, and 10 months of age. More specifically, we characterize changes in synaptic function, learning behavior, Aß accumulation, and/or AD-associated molecular network pathology that we attribute to either aging or genotype or a combination of the two.

miR155−/− deletion in non-transgenic (i.e., WT) mice was associated with deleterious effects on learning, cellular, and transcriptomic phenotypes that share many features with those observed in the brains of humans with AD. In addition to the effects of miR155 deletion on basal synaptic transmission, LTD, and LTP at 10 months in WT mice, we also found that 4-month-old miR155−/− mice shared substantial transcriptomic similarity with APP/PSEN1 mice, have reduced expression of genes with AD-risk associated cis-eQTL, and induce DEG that are perturbed in a manner consistent with that reported in postmortem human AD brain tissue from several independent cohorts and brain regions. Integration of these DEGs with human AD single-nucleus transcriptomic studies [53] suggests that these changes correspond to loss of an excitatory neuronal subpopulation that is reported to be lost in AD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a mouse model wherein genetic deficiency of a regulatory molecule (i.e., miR155) is apparently associated with widespread transcriptomic pathology closely resembling that of the human AD brain.

Constitutive deletion of miR155 in APP/PSEN1 mice was associated with a different constellation of phenotypes, which, when taken together, indicate that miR155 loss mitigates the severity of the phenotype associated with APP/PSEN1 transgenes. We observed that the deletion of miR155 was associated with increased size and frequency of Aß plaques in 4- and 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice. Despite the acceleration of neuropathology, this was also associated with a rescue effect on learning behavior in 4- and 8-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice, and a partial rescue of synaptic plasticity in 10-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice. These findings indicate that miR155 deletion induces complex but largely beneficial effects on learning and gene expression in APP/PSEN1 mice at multiple ages.

While the detrimental effects of miR155 deletion on synaptic function are partly illuminated via the transcriptomic data, the molecular basis of the complex effects observed in the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice is less clear. This is partly a function of the relatively smaller DEG signature sizes observed in the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− comparisons, which may reflect either a subtler biological change or may relate to the sample sizes profiled (n=4 per group). The transcriptomic data do offer some clues, however. The consistent downregulation of BTG3 in miR155−/− at 4 and 8 months of age, and the accentuation of this downregulation in APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− at both ages may indicate a reduction in proteolytic activity against Aß42 into fragments that are necessary for Aß42 aggregation. This may suggest a mechanism that accounts for the accelerated Aß plaque accumulation in the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− mice at both ages.

We also observed several DEGs in the APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− comparisons, which may indicate mechanisms relevant to synaptic function and learning, particularly glutamatergic signaling and neurogenesis pathways. SPTBN2 (downregulated in 4-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1) encodes a ß-III cytoskeletal spectrin gene that interacts with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α, with mutations in SPTBN2 inducing diminished mGluR1-mediated response and decreased LTP[2]. LFNG (downregulated in 8-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1) mediated NOTCH1 glycosylation is a critical driver of NOTCH1 activity[57], with downstream effects on synaptic plasticity and memory[18], hippocampal plasticity and glutamatergic transmission[10]. In addition to its increased abundance in plasma and brain of subjects with AD[79], ALPL (downregulated in 4-month-old APP/PSEN1;miR155−/− vs. APP/PSEN1) is localized around synaptic contacts, and is implicated in synaptic activity and maturation[25], as well as axonal development[21]. Any, all, or some combination of these molecules (i.e., BTG3, SPTBN2, LFNG, ALPL) could be evaluated as potential therapeutic opportunities.

Additional work is needed to fully illuminate the mechanistic basis of APP/PSEN1-dependent effects and miR155 deletion-dependent effects on mouse brain biology. Sierksma et al. [70] reported that miR155 was upregulated in APP/PSEN1 mice, and Guedes et al. [28] reported that upregulation of miR155 in 12 month 3xTg mice is an important molecular mediator of neuroinflammation. We also observed that miR155 was elevated within the DG of 12-month-old APP/PSEN1 mice, supporting the notion that miR155 might serve as a molecular mediator of the effects of APP/PSEN1 and/or Aß upon hippocampal physiology and learning behavior. Whether miR155 serves a corresponding role in the context of human late-onset AD is yet to be established, though we did observe that miR155 is upregulated in the CA1 hippocampus of AD subjects compared with controls. Given the proposal by Butovsky[41] that miR155 may modulate the action(s) and/or phenotype of microglia during neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS and AD, it will be important to confirm which cell type(s) are responsible at preclinical stages of these disorders as well as during more obvious clinical progression. In some mouse models of neurodegeneration (e.g. ALS), proteinopathy can be well established during preclinical phases, and the appearance of clinical progression coincides with the appearance of activated microglia[17].

In addition to reports of miR155 dysregulation associating with diverse neurodegenerative diseases (ALS, PD, GD, HD, and AD), and neurological conditions (TBI), several investigators have demonstrated in in vivo and in vitro model systems that miR155 can act as a causal mediator of neuroinflammation, particularly in ALS[12], PD[78], and TBI[31]. In AD, miR155 has been demonstrated as a mediator of TREM2-APOE induced switching of microglia to a neurodegenerative phenotype [41], and upregulation of miR155 has been reported to mediate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the 3xTg AD mouse model[28]. Our observation that miR155 deletion provides a therapeutic benefit on synaptic function and memory in APP/PSEN1 mice is consistent with these findings. Our results also suggest that miR155 can act as a modifier of AD-associated neuropathology, as well as a mediator of cognitive phenotypes. Our observation that miR155 deletion in WT mice induces synaptic dysfunction and DEG signatures that mirror transcriptomic changes observed in late-onset AD raise the possibility that therapeutic manipulation of miR155 levels might alter the presence and extent of some neuropathological features of the disease. AD has recently been formulated as a multiplex of disease mechanisms [71]. Our data are consistent with such a formulation, indicating that miR155 may be positioned at a point where several components of this multiplex of AD pathogenic mechanisms intersect. Whether the inhibition of miR155 would represent an impactful therapeutic strategy remains to be established; however, the accumulated data suggest that the investigation of miR155 in AD may offer a unique window into the crossroads of innate immunity, viral response networks, neuropathology and neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation.
