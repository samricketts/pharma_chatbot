Cerebral endothelial cells and their linking tight junctions form a unique, dynamic and multi-functional interface, the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The endothelium is regulated by perivascular cells and components forming the neurovascular unit (NVU). This review examines BBB and NVU changes in normal aging and in neurodegenerative disorders, particularly focusing on Alzheimer’s disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and vascular dementia. Increasing evidence indicates BBB dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration. Mechanisms underlying BBB dysfunction are outlined (endothelium and NVU mediated) as is the BBB as a therapeutic target including increasing the uptake of systemically delivered therapeutics across the BBB, enhancing clearance of potential neurotoxic compounds via the BBB, and preventing BBB dysfunction. Finally, a need for novel biomarkers of BBB dysfunction is addressed.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Brain endothelial cells (BECs) and their linking tight junctions (TJs) form part of a unique interface, the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is dynamic and multi-functional. Thus, BEC TJs limit paracellular movement of hydrophilic molecules; they have limited transcytosis and leukocyte transmigration; BECs possess a range of solute transporters facilitating entry of nutrients to brain, clearing waste products/xenobiotics from brain and participating in brain ion homeostasis; they also express a range of detoxifying enzymes protecting the brain.1,2 Although the BECs are central to the BBB, they are part of the larger neurovascular unit (NVU), including astrocytes, pericytes, perivascular macrophages and the extracellular matrix, which regulates BBB function.1,2

Normal aging impacts cerebral endothelium, BBB and NVU. However, those structural and functional changes are exacerbated in neurogenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and vascular dementia (VaD)3. BBB dysfunction contributes to brain injury by allowing entry of neuroactive compounds from blood, inducing vasogenic edema, altering NVU function and enhancing neuroinflammation. While BBB dysfunction may be secondary to pathological changes in brain parenchyma, there is compelling evidence that BBB alterations contribute to disease progression and represent a therapeutic target.4

This review addresses: changes occurring at the BBB with aging and different forms of neurodegeneration; underlying mechanisms; the BBB as a therapeutic target. It focuses primarily on studies from the past 5 years while also citing earlier foundational research.

THE NORMAL ADULT BBB

The primary functions of the BBB are regulating entry of blood-borne molecules into brain and preserving brain homeostasis. Structurally, it is composed of capillary BECs, and a complex network of perivascular cells/milieu composed of astrocytes and pericytes that wrap capillaries, neurons/neuronal endings, transiently present macrophages/microglia, and extracellular matrix.1,2 Due to structural complexity and expanded function (e.g., neurovascular coupling) the BBB is considered as part of the NVU (Fig 1).

BECs of the BBB have well-developed junctional complexes with TJs (claudin-5, occludin, JAM-A, ZO-1), adherens junctions (Ve-cadherin, α-, β-, γ-catenin) and gap junctions (connexin-43, −37, −40), multiple transporters systems, reduced cell thickness, limited vesicle numbers and tight integration with brain parenchyma.2,5 The TJs restrict paracellular permeability. They are built by intricate interactions between transmembrane proteins, important for paracellular space occlusion, scaffolding proteins and actin cytoskeleton/binding proteins vital for physical support and junction function.5 Transmembrane claudins, predominantly claudin-5, generate strand-like structures on the cell lateral membrane, occlude the paracellular space and restrict paracellular permeability.5 Other transmembrane junction proteins, occludin and JAM-A, regulate TJ complex stability and formation. Scaffolding proteins (e.g., ZO-1) provide structural support, interact with the cytoskeleton, regulate of signaling events and TJ assembly/organization.1 The cytoskeleton (actin filaments, non-muscular myosin, microtubules and actin binding proteins) plays a critical role in TJ adhesive properties, mechano-sensing and mechano-transduction.5

Any defect in these components, can affect TJ stability, directly affecting BBB integrity and increasing permeability. BBB hyperpermeability varies from complete loss of some TJ proteins (e.g., claudin-5 and occludin) leading to BBB breakdown, to morphologically fragmented (“difficult to detect”) TJ alterations which induce small BBB leaks causing parenchymal accumulation of plasma proteins and fluid leading to brain dysfunction.6

Compared to systemic endothelial cells, BECs have a paucity of vesicles/transcytosis, limiting non-selective transcellular movement of solutes.1 However, BBB receptor-mediated transcytosis is important for transport of select proteins, such as transferrin.1,6 Many neurological conditions are associated with marked increases in BBB transcytosis and this can contribute to observed barrier hyperpermeability.1,2,5

BECs possess a wide range of transporters.7 These include facilitative transporters such as Glut1 essential for brain glucose uptake.7 Other transporters are directly or indirectly ATP dependent. Such transport can be polarized (i.e., epithelial-like) as is the case for P-glycoprotein an efflux pump on the luminal membrane that protects the brain from xenobiotics.7 BEC transporters may act in concert moving substrates across the BBB. Thus, for example, amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) transport is mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) at the abluminal membrane (uptake from brain) as well as luminal P-glycoprotein (efflux to blood) and receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE; uptake from blood).8

There is a gradual zonation in BEC phenotype with differences in gene expression profile between capillaries (e.g. MFSD2a -essential 3 omega fatty acid transporter), arterioles/arteries [e.g. Bmx - non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Efnb2 (ephrin B2) and Vegfc (vascular endothelial growth factor C)] and venules/veins [e.g., Nr2f2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 2) and Slc38a5 (sodium-dependent amino acid transporter)].9

The BEC glycocalyx is a thick luminal gel-like structure consisting of proteoglycans and glycoproteins that adhere to the endothelial cell membrane (syndecan, glypican) or form a glycocalyx mesh (mimecan, perlecan, biglycan).10 It forms a physical and charge barrier, mediates mechanical transduction, maintains BBB integrity and has anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties.10

Perivascular components maintain and regulate BBB properties. Pericytes maintain BBB integrity and regulate vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, neurovascular coupling and neuroinflammation and possibly cerebral blood flow (CBF); although this is controversial.1,11–13 Perivascular astrocytes project end-feet on to the capillaries. They regulate BEC BBB properties (TJ assembly, permeability and recovery), pericyte localization and recruitment, water movement via aquaporin-4 (AQP4), CBF, angiogenesis, inflammation and metabolism.11 Perivascular macrophages and microglia regulate BBB inflammation, BBB stability and integrity, vasoconstriction and have roles in angiogenesis and BBB recovery.14–16 Finally, some neurons/neuronal endings lie close to the BEC basement membrane regulating neurovascular coupling, BBB development (Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathways), CBF regulation, microvascular permeability, as well as interacting with the extracellular matrix and stimulating angiogenesis.11,14,17

In addition to cellular components, the NVU has extracellular matrix (ECM) components critical for BBB structure and function. ECM in the NVU is organized in basal lamina (collagen IV, laminin, fibronectin, dystroglycan, perlecan) surrounding and separating BEC from brain parenchyma, and an interstitial matrix (containing proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, tenascins, laminins, fibronectins) filling the extracellular space and restricting diffusion between cells.18

THE BBB AND NVU IN NORMAL AGING AND NEURODEGENERATION

Changes in capillary morphology in aging, AD, AD-vasculopathy and VaD: Brain capillaries undergo morphological changes in aging and age-associated vasculopathy. These include increased vascular tortuosity, looping and kinking (AD), irregularity in capillary diameter (AD), basement membrane thickening, splitting and duplication, abnormal patterns of branching, fusion and budding of vessels (AD), raspberry-like clusters (VaD, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and AD), microartheroma, lipohyalinosis, fibrinoid necrosis or microaneurysms (VaD, non-amyloid small vessels diseases), perivascular hemosiderin (CAA, AD), perivascular space dilatation and microinfarction (VaD).19 Two footprints of capillary vascular defects are BBB hyperpermeability, due to junction structural changes (e.g., reduced length and number of TJs per vessels), and metabolic changes (reduced expression of Glut-1, increased pinocytotic vesicles and decreased mitochondria).20,21 There is also extensive NVU remodeling with astrocytic end-feet swelling, loss of pericyte engagement, basement membrane thickening, loss of vessel-matrix-connections, and recruitment of perivascular macrophages, microglia and leukocytes.21–23

Clinical and experimental data indicate a slow decline in BBB integrity with age, with a progressive loss of function in AD-associated vasculopathy and VaD.23–25 This decline depends on two ongoing parallel and/or synchronized processes: BEC injury, with metabolic and structural changes (an endothelial-centric process), and NVU remodeling (an NVU-centric process).

BBB function in normal aging:

Aging, a major factor in neurodegenerative diseases, impacts cerebrovascular and BBB function. Although neurodegenerative diseases impact specific brain regions (e.g., hippocampus), aging-associated cerebrovascular pathology is dependent on zonation (differential effects with vessel type), rather than brain region, with capillaries being more susceptible.25,26 The BBB appears the epicenter of vascular-guided injury in aging. BBB leakage occurs in hippocampus, cortex, corpus callosum with reduced expression of key TJ proteins (claudin-5, ZO-1, occludin).25,27 Claudin-5 downregulation is a major marker of the aging BBB, but TJ remodeling also includes expression of non-typical TJ proteins like claudin-1 present in leaky blood vessels with aging (Fig 2).26–28

Endothelial-based processes like inflammation (involving interleukin-1β, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and toll-like receptor 4), mitochondrial damage (respiratory electron transport chain/ATP synthesis, glucose/energy metabolism (e.g., Hmgcs2, Pea15a, and multiple SLC transporters) and epigenetic modification via histone deacetylase Sirt1, or noncoding RNA (miR-92a-3p, miR195) most likely drive cell and barrier damage.26,27,29,30 This is supported by NVU remodeling (decreased pericytes, loss of BEC-pericyte interaction, presence of reactive astrocytes and diminished neurovascular coupling) which may further intensify endothelial and barrier aging processes.9,31

Barrier declines with aging is also reflected in BBB transcytosis. There is a downregulation in major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2 (MFSD2A), a critical suppressor of BBB transcytosis. The decline in MFSD2A affects caveolin-1 expression and caveolin-dependent transcytosis.26

The impact of normal aging on BBB transport has been relatively understudied. However, Glut1 expression and activity is reduced in aging rodents and the expression of P-glycoprotein and LRP1 are decreased impacting Aβ clearance from brain.32 In contrast, RAGE expression increased affecting Aβ uptake from blood.32 BBB transporter function during aging merits more investigation considering the importance for brain drug delivery and brain homeostasis.

Aging alters the BEC glycocalyx, basement membrane and interstitial ECM. The glycocalyx undergoes changes in glycosaminoglycan, hyaluronic acid and heparin sulfate proteoglycan content, reducing glycocalyx thickness and altering critical functions (e.g., anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties).10,33 Aged capillaries show increased collagen IV accumulation and basement membrane thickening.22 Furthermore, interstitial ECM has decreased laminin, nidogen and fibronectin, and increased perlecan expression.18 These extracellular changes may contribute to diminished BBB function as well as capillary pathology in aging.

BBB in AD, AD-vasculopathy and inherited forms of CAA:

AD is commonly associated with the sporadic form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), an age-dependent small vessel disease, that occurs in 80–100% of cases with AD.34 Inherited CAA is rarer and due to mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), cystatin C, gelsolin or BRI2 precursor proteins.35,36 The major pathological findings in sporadic and inherited CAA is Aβ (amyloid1–40 and amyloid1–42) accumulation in the perivascular space or vessel wall of cortical and leptomeningeal capillaries and arterioles (type 1) or Aβ-soluble form in larger caliber vessels (type 2), and a localized robust neuroinflammatory response. Aβ-affected vessels represent a pathological basis for developing cerebrovascular disorders like micro- and macro-hemorrhage and micro- and macroinfarction.37 AD and CAA have overlapping pathology, sharing genetic polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E (ApoE), presenilin 1 (PS1), α1-antichymotrypsin and neprilysin.38–40 In particular, possession of the Apoε4 allele is associated with CAA severity.39

Evidence indicates that compromised BBB integrity is a hallmark of AD (Fig 2).41 Changes in BBB permeability in AD and AD-associated vasculopathy, including sporadic CAA and inherited CAA type 1, are associated with selective decreases in ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, −3, −5, and −11 (Fig. 2 and 3). These occur predominantly in cortical vessels and are closely associated with AD pathology (neurofibrillary tangle stage and synaptic loss).42 Aβ accumulation, particularly insoluble form of Aβ40, Aβ42, can directly alter TJ proteins expression and BBB permeability.43,44 However, BBB leakage and TJ protein changes can occur in vessels with no Aβ accumulation, suggesting that Aβ may cause/augment BBB injury (Fig 3).

Various mechanisms in BECs are indicated in remodeling/destabilizing TJs in AD-associated vasculopathy. These can act on post-translational modification and degradation of TJ proteins via three major processes: cytotoxic effects such as Aβ-induced Ca2 +-calcineurin signaling; inflammation involving a spectrum of mediators including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade both extracellular matrix and TJs, cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-23), chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL4, CCL3, CCL7, CXCL10), complement components (e.g., C1q, C3) and adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM, P-selectin, E-selectin) that drive intrinsic signaling in BECs and in concert drive leukocyte (e.g., GM-CSF), microglial and perivascular macrophage (e.g., colony stimulating factor) migration and activation into perivascular space; as well as mitochondrial impairment and increased reactive oxygen species (e.g., NADPH oxidase-2) that contribute to the endothelial Aβ toxicity and BEC inflammatory responses involved in TJ remodeling.16,45,46

Altered TJ protein expression in Aβ-affected BECs can also occur at the transcriptional level through downregulation of transcriptional factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and serum response factor/myocardin related transcription factor A (SRF-MRTF-A) activity. Reduced TJ protein expression creates a “defective and vulnerable” brain endothelial barrier.47,48 It is also important to highlight the contribution of epigenetic mechanisms. Although there is sparse evidence on histone modification, DNA methylation and histone deacetylase activity in BECs, some recent studies indicate that dysregulation of microRNAs (e.g., downregulation miR-107, miR-124 and upregulation of miR224–4p and miR-424–5p) and long non-coding RNAs LINC00662, LINC00094 affect BBB integrity. In particular, dysregulation of miR-124 and miR-107, as well as LINC00662, impacts ZO-1, claudin-5 and occludin transcription in BECs in AD by modifying erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor family members, ERG and ELK4.49–52

Among other factors contributing to BBB dysfunction and TJ complex destabilization are variants of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Compared to people carrying ApoE3, ApoE4 is associated with AD severity and vascular damage.40,53,54 In contrast, ApoE2 is protective.54 Although there is a close correlation of these variants with BBB permeability in AD, their role and mechanism of action is still largely unknown and controversial.

NVU derangement can also affect BBB permeability and TJ complex stability (Fig 2 and 4). Pericytes have a central role in regulating BBB permeability in AD.53,55 Vascular amyloid fibrillar deposits cause pericyte atrophy (large numbers of intracellular inclusions, pinocytotic vesicles, large lipid granules and mitochondrial abnormalities) and pericyte coverage.55 That may lead to reductions in cerebral capillary perfusion, CBF and neurovascular coupling causing chronic hypoxia and affecting barrier integrity. Loss of pericyte/BEC contact can destabilize TJs as can bidirectional pericyte/BEC inflammatory signaling can alter TJ complex stability. An example is the effect of IL-1β and NLRP3, an inflammasome-forming pattern recognition receptor, on pericytes in BBB disruption.55

In AD, perivascular astrocytes have swollen end-feet due to loss of water channel aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and activation (increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression).56 A direct link between astrocyte changes and BBB hyperpermeability in AD is uncertain, although activated astrocytes can promote BBB leakage through oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. It should be noted that astrocyte changes may impact AD via mechanisms other than BBB regulation. The glymphatic system hypothesis proposes a major role of astrocyte AQP4 in brain fluid flow and Aβ clearance (see Hladky &amp; Barrand57 for a detailed discussion of the relative importance of glymphatic vs. BBB Aβ clearance).

Inflammatory cells, including microglia and infiltrating leukocytes can also contribute to BBB dysfunction (Fig 2 and 4). In Aβ-affected NVU, robust microglia and perivascular macrophage activation and recruitment occurs.16,58 Besides governing inflammatory responses and contributing to endothelial toxicity via reactive oxygen species, perivascular macrophages and microglial cells may directly regulate BBB disruption and TJ protein expression by interaction with BECs via the colony stimulating factor (CSF)-CSF1R axis.16,58,59 That axis regulates claudin-5 expression in CAA and modifies occludin and ZO-1 expression.58 Regarding infiltrating leukocytes, emerging evidence pinpoints several potential mechanisms impacting BBB integrity, including increased cytokine, chemokine and MMP production, and the effect of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on BBB structure.60,61

Basement membrane thickening and ECM remodeling have important roles in NVU changes in AD vasculopathy. Capillary basement membrane thickening is associated with increased collagen-4 (COL4) reflecting increased vascular stress.18 Aβ affected vessels have higher COL4, although Aβ deposition and COL4 content only correlates in certain brain regions. Intriguingly, changes in COL4 level in basement membrane were not found in CAA although Aβ accumulation is progressive. Pathological accumulation of collagen may contribute to disrupted BBB transport, BEC/pericyte interactions, and hypoxic events in BECs that in turn affect BBB integrity.18 Recent clinical and experimental studies reported increased accumulation of perlecan, agrin, fibronectin and decreased level of laminin at the BBB/NVU in AD. Increased perlecan, agrin and fibronectin in the perivascular space and basement membrane is associated with Aβ accumulation, inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.18,62 Perlecan and fibronectin indirectly effect BBB integrity by promoting inflammatory processes and affecting cell-cell interactions.62 Regarding the BEC glycocalyx, there are changes in composition and thickness that may indicate phenotypic changes but solid evidence is still lacking.

Studies on the impact of AD on BBB transport have primarily focused on Glut1 and P-glycoprotein, with evidence of downregulation.8,63 The former may contribute to a shortage of brain energy substrates, while the latter could reduce brain Aβ clearance, exacerbating Aβ buildup.8,63 There needs to be a wider exploration of the effects of AD and CAA on BBB transport. Alterations in BEC metabolism are likely to impact a wide range of transporters.

BBB in vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment:

VaD is a cognitive deficit disorder caused by impaired CBF and vascular injury. This is the second most common type of dementia after AD (10–20% of cases).64 Due to the heterogenous vascular pathology that contributes to cognitive impairment, the term vascular dementia was changed to an umbrella term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Besides the severe form of VCI, VaD includes multi-infarct dementia (cortical vascular dementia), small vessel dementia (small vessel disease and subcortical vascular dementia-Binswanger diseases), strategic infarct dementia, hypoperfusion dementia, hemorrhagic dementia, hereditary vascular dementia (CADASIL and CARASIL)65. VCI and VaD are cardiovascular diseases. Critical risk factors are hypertension, atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis, prior stroke history, diabetes mellitus and smoking.64,66 VaD pathology is complex but often presents as vasculitis in big and small caliber brain vessels. The pathological features of VCI and VaD are very heterogeneous in cause and affected area. In small vessel dementia, brain arterioles and capillaries are predominantly impacted causing reduced brain perfusion, BBB damage, lacunar infarcts and dementia.65 A progressive form of small vessel disease is Binswanger syndrome characterized by extensive white matter injury and gradual subcortical ischemia. CADASIL and CARASIL are caused by NOTCH 3 and HTRA mutations, respectively and are characterized by multiple and recurrent strokes and progressive cognitive impairment.64

There have been diverse findings on BBB leakage and TJ protein alterations in VCI and VaD.41 BBB leakage is often detected in lesions associated with VaD and VCI although alterations in TJ protein expression is often lacking in human studies while experimental data shows alterations in protein expression (Fig. 2). For example, in white matter hypertensive lesions, BBB leakage was associated with high occludin expression, while claudin-2, −5 and −11 expression showed significantly difference internally in observed groups, but without evident difference between VaD and controls.64,67,68 Similarly, in subcortical or periventricular lesions in VaD or CADASIL brains, increased BBB albumin extravasation was not associated with changes in claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 expression.67 In contrast, preclinically, in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis or in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 expression were decreased and associated with BBB leakage.67,69 The reason for this discrepancy remains unknown although heterogeneity in pathological substrate, unclear guidance on VCI diagnosis, and small patient numbers with different forms of VCI may play a role. Intriguingly, a few recent studies indicate some TJ protein changes in the BBB pathology of small vessel disease and VaD. Genetic variants of claudin-1 were associated with development of leukoaraiosis, a major manifestation of VaD, or more advanced white matter lesions. Intriguingly, three single nucleotide polymorphisms of claudin-1 (rs17501010, rs893051 and rs9290927) have different distribution patterns with hypertension, and a singular SNP (rs9290927) showed a different pattern in diabetes.70 Another TJ protein indirectly indicated in VaD-induced BBB hyperpermeability is JAM-A. Results indicate JAM-A is involved in hypertension-induced TJ alterations.71 Giving its dual role as a TJ protein and a leukocyte adhesion molecule, its function in VaD needs further exploration.

Emerging evidence pinpoints similarities between VaD and ischemia/hypoxia-induced BBB leakage and TJ protein changes. Several mechanisms including mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, diminished angiogenesis is considered driving forces of the BBB injury. Altered cytokine (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6), chemokine (CCL2) levels and adhesion molecule (e.g., VCAM) expression and overactive MMP-2 and −9 are reported in VaD affecting BBB integrity.72 Elevations in angiogenic factors, Ki67, NG2, VEGF-A, and MMP-3 in endothelial cells and pericytes indicate hypoxic injury of BBB in VaD and TJ destabilization.67

An intriguing factor is β-secretase (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1; BACE1), which is increased in BECs of small cerebral vessels from hypertensive subjects where occludin levels were decreased.73 Proteolytic cleavage of occludin by endothelial BACE1 disrupts TJs and enhances interaction of eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) with caveolin-1 inhibiting eNOS activation.73 Non-coding RNAs may also regulate BBB permeability and TJ protein expression in VaD. Experimental studies in a multiple microinfarction model of VaD and in bilateral common carotid artery stenosis, found modified expression of miR126 (downregulated), miR-501–3p (upregulated) and Lin28a, three miRs involved in BBB disruption and neuroinflammation through MMP9 and TLR4, and astrocyte and microglia activation.69,74,75 Direct evidence on miR regulation of TJ proteins at the transcription level is still lacking. Another factor implied in indirect regulation of BBB integrity and TJ protein expression in VaD is hyperlipidemia. Hyperlipidemia, particularly due to VaD comorbidities, can compromise BBB integrity by inducing inflammatory mediators and decreasing TJ proteins.76

NVU remodeling in VaD is closely associated with pericyte degeneration, and astrocyte, microglial and perivascular macrophage activation. Their effect on BBB permeability and TJ expression is mostly indirect by regulating ongoing hypoxic injury (hypoxia inducible factor-1α activation), free radical production (Nox2) and inflammation (MMPs, TNF-α, IL1β, TGFβ).23,67 MMPs, produced by astrocytes (MMP2) and pericytes (MMP3), degrade TJ proteins and the ECM.67,77 MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 expression are considered markers of BBB impairment in VCI and VaD.77 Regarding ECM and basement membrane remodeling, collagen-4 (COL4), perlecan, fibronectin deposition is indicated in a subpopulation of hypertensive VaD patients.72,77 They indirectly effect on BBB permeability and TJ expression by enhancing of ongoing hypoxic injury and inflammation.

BBB dysfunction in other forms of neurodegeneration: This review focuses on AD, CAA and VaD, but BBB hyperpermeability occurs in other forms of neurodegeneration including dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease.78,79 BBB hyperpermeability in Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease is associated with altered BEC TJs.78 More information is needed on changes in BBB transcytosis and transport.

A major question in these types of neurodegeneration is whether BBB effects are directly via the BEC or indirect via other NVU elements. Current data suggest differences depending on the type of neurodegeneration. Thus, a study on BEC-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stems cells from Huntington’s disease patients indicated a direct impact of Huntington’s disease mutations on BEC function (angiogenesis and barrier functions).80 In contrast, an in vitro Parkinson’s disease-related study found no direct effects of monomeric alpha-synuclein on BECs but indirect effects via pericytes and astrocytes.81,82

THE BBB AND NEURODEGENERATION THERAPIES

With regards to the BBB and treatments for neurodegeneration, there are four main areas of focus: 1) increasing uptake of systemically delivered therapeutics across the BBB; 2) enhancing clearance of potential neurotoxic compounds (e.g., Aβ) via the BBB; 3) preventing BBB dysfunction; 4) detecting BBB dysfunction. These are discussed focusing on AD, although the points raised also apply to other forms of neurodegeneration.

Enhancing BBB drug delivery: Current AD therapies include cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and tacrine) and an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist (memantine). While these small molecules cross the BBB, they only slow disease progression. There have, therefore, been multiple clinical trials of small molecules targeting Aβ production (BACE1 and gamma secretase inhibitors) or Aβ fibrils as underlying causes of pathology. However, those trials have not shown benefit, perhaps related to toxicity and specificity83.

Biologics have the potential of greater specificity compared to small molecule inhibitors. This has led to many clinical trials of antibodies targeting Aβ and tau in AD.83,84 With the debated exception of aducanumab, these trials have failed. That failure has been ascribed to the extremely low penetrance of antibodies across the BBB. In clinical trial, aducanumab did reduce amyloid plaques, indicating target engagement, but at those doses it also caused amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) of edema suggesting that aducanumab may enter the brain by causing BBB disruption.85

There has been much effort to enhance delivery of antibodies and other biologics across the BBB. One potential method is to target receptor-mediated transcytosis at the BBB; e.g., linking therapeutics to antibodies targeting the BEC transferrin receptor. An example of this approach is lecanemab (BAN2401), a bispecific antibody formed by fusing gantenerumab, an antibody targeting Aβ fibrils, and an antibody against the human transferrin receptor.86 It showed evidence of reduced brain amyloid and it is currently in phase III clinical trials (NCT03887455 and NCT04468659).

A wide range of delivery vehicles are being examined to enhance transport across the BBB for AD. These include: liposomes, polymeric micelles and quantum dots.87 In addition, therapeutics can be conjugated to peptides such as Angiopep2 and TAT to enhance BBB uptake via absorptive endocytosis.

It should be noted that a recent clinical trial of gantenerumab (antibody targeting Aβ fibrils) and solanezumab (targeting soluble Aβ) in AD,88 failed to show a benefit on cognitive decline even though gantenerumab reduced amyloid plaques and CSF levels of total and phospho-tau. This raises whether the failure was due to target selection rather than target engagement.

Another method to increase brain delivery of therapeutics is transient BBB disruption. The safety of MRI-guided focused ultrasound with microbubbles to induce BBB disruption has been examined in AD patients.89,90 There is also some evidence that focused ultrasound itself may reduce the level of neurotoxic compounds in brain. Thus, Karakstsani et al.91 found it reduced brain phosphorylated Tau levels in a mouse AD model via an immune response.

Other methods of inducing BBB disruption merit investigation in neurodegeneration. Those include targeting BEC TJs, e.g., siRNAs or peptides targeting the extracellular loop of claudin-5.92 Another approach is to target signaling pathways regulating TJ dynamics such as pathways regulating the cytoskeleton.

Enhancing BBB clearance: There has been interest in harnessing BBB transporters to clear potential neurotoxins. An example is preserving P-glycoprotein activity to enhance Aβ clearance. Thus, Hartz et al.93 found preventing P-glycoprotein degradation by inhibiting ubiquitination in a mouse (Tg2576) overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein reduced brain human Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. Similarly, Ding et al.8, found that nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor, that prevents P-glycoprotein internalization decreased human Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in Tg2576 mouse brain.

Protecting the BBB: As noted above, there is evidence that BBB and NVU dysfunction occurs early in AD, that such dysfunction contributes to AD pathology and that it represents a therapeutic target. A wide range of strategies have been examined to try and reduce BBB dysfunction in AD and overall neurodegeneration (reviewed by Nehra et al.94). Strategies include targeting reactive oxygen species generated by exposure to Aβ, mitochondrial damage, cerebral hypoperfusion or angiotensin signaling.94 While vitamin K antagonists increase the risk of BBB leakage and hemorrhage in AD, thrombin inhibitors and anti-platelet drugs may reduce such dysfunction.94 Similarly, a recombinant form of activated protein C (3K3-APC), with mutations to lower anti-coagulant activity while preserving cell signaling effects, improved cerebrovascular activity and CBF responses in a mouse AD model (5XFAD).95 In preclinical AD models, both angiotensin II receptor blockade and mTOR inhibition reduced BBB dysfunction.96,97 The latter may involve inhibiting inflammation. Hur et al. also found that docosahexaenoic acid reduced microhemorrhages and vascular Aβ accumulation in Tg2576 mice by suppressing inflammation.98

Although there is preclinical evidence that Aβ has direct adverse BBB/NVU effects, in several trials Aβ immunotherapy has been associated with greater BBB dysfunction, with ARIA with edema or microhemorrhages, the extent of which were antibody dependent.94 It may be that the downstream pathways induced (directly or indirectly) by Aβ at the BEC may be a better therapeutic target. While there was interest in using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce BBB dysfunction in AD, the Alzheimer’s Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (NCT00007189) found increased AD pathology severity.99

Detecting BBB dysfunction: Currently, detection of BBB disruption in patients relies on imaging or CSF albumin quotients (QAlb; ratio of CSF and serum albumin concentrations). Treatments for BBB disruption would benefit from having blood biomarker of such disruption, both for patient identification and to assess therapeutic efficacy. Blood biomarkers for traumatic brain injury, such as ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase-L1 and GFAP, reflect both parenchymal and BBB damage and specific blood biomarkers of BBB disruption are needed. Two promising current directions examine the appearance of soluble TJ proteins or BEC exosomes in blood. For example, Shi et al.100 found a marked increase in blood occludin after focal ischemia in rats and in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Exosomes (extracellular vesicles) can be released from BECs in blood after injury. One possible marker of those exosomes is CD31 which is highly expressed at the BBB. Increases in blood CD31 positive exosomes occur in several neurological conditions, including limited data on AD.101 Extended exploration of such techniques in neurodegeneration may indicate whether they can be used as biomarkers of BBB dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

This review summarizes advances in our knowledge on the occurrence and impact of BBB dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases and potential therapeutic BBB directed approaches. While there have been considerable advances in the past decade, there is much still to be learnt about such dysfunction and how to prevent it. Some questions to highlight are: 1) Would preventing the BBB effects of normal aging significantly impact neurodegenerative disease-induced dysfunction? 2) What is the relative importance of intrinsic endothelial vs. NVU signaling in inducing BBB dysfunction in neurodegeneration? This is important as the endothelium is an easier to target. A greater use of endothelial specific genetic manipulations or endothelial targeted therapies could address this question. 3) Results indicate multiple pathways can induce BBB dysfunction in neurodegeneration. Will targeting one pathway be a sufficient treatment or is it necessary to target multiple pathways? 4) How much commonality is there between BBB dysfunction in different types of neurodegeneration? 5) Does Aβ deposition around blood vessels physically stabilize them? Hopefully, increases in knowledge in such areas will soon translate to the clinic.

Figure 3. Representative images of MRI analyses of BBB permeability in CAA murine model (Tg-SwDi) and control mice. BBB hyperpermeability to Gd-DTPA and analyzed by T1w MRI and T1 map of BBB transfer coefficient Ki varying from 0–1min−1. Histologically, BBB permeability was confirmed by visualizing BBB leakiness to cadaverine-594 (Red). Blood vessels (green, Tomato lectin-DyLight 488) with Aβ deposits (blue, Amyloid Glo, arrowhead) showed increased leakiness to cadaverine (arrow) vs. control mice. Increased BBB permeability was associated with reduced claudin-5 (green) and ZO-1 (purple) interaction (yellow arrowhead) and expression. Representative images are the maximum 3D projection of z-stack (400μm). Scale bar 100μm.
