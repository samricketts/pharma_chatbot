Background:

It is difficult to assess brain health status and risk of cognitive impairment, particularly at the initial evaluation. To address this, we developed the Brain Health Platform to quantify brain health and identify Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) risk factors by combining a measure of brain health: the Resilience Index (RI), a measure of risk of ADRD; the Vulnerability Index (VI); and the Number-Symbol Coding Task (NSCT), a measure of brain performance.

Objective:

The Brain Health Platform is intended to be easily and quickly administered, providing an overview of a patient’s risk of developing future impairment based on modifiable and non-modifiable factors as well as current cognitive performance.

Methods:

This cross-sectional study comprehensively evaluated 230 participants (71 controls, 71 mild cognitive impairment, 88 ADRD). VI and RI scores were derived from physical assessments, lifestyle questionnaires, demographics, medical history, and neuropsychological examination including the NSCT.

Results:

Individuals with abnormal scores were 95.7% likely to be impaired, with a misclassification rate of 9.7%. The combined model had excellent discrimination (AUC:0.923 ± 0.053; p &lt; 0.001), performing better than the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.

Conclusion:

The Brain Health Platform combines measures of resilience, vulnerability, and performance to provide a cross-sectional snapshot of overall brain health. The Brain Health Platform can effectively and accurately identify even the very mildest impairments due to ADRD, leveraging brief yet powerful and actionable indices of brain health and risk that could be used to develop personalized, precision medicine-like interventions.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) affect over 6 million individuals, with this number expected to increase dramatically as the current population ages, resulting in greatly increased healthcare costs [1]. One avenue for mitigating these costs is early identification of risk, early accurate diagnosis and initiating therapies, and enhancing enrollment into clinical trials testing novel diagnostics and therapeutics. One of the great challenges in conducting research on healthy brain aging and ADRD in community samples is determining the most time-efficient, cost-effective, and culturally relevant standardized measurement of medical, social, and environmental factors that may increase the risk of ADRD (vulnerability) or may provide some protective benefits from ADRD (resilience). Genetic mutations have been linked to rare familial forms of ADRD [2, 3], but it is difficult to explain risk of the more common sporadic forms of ADRD. An important question remains—“Why do some older adults develop ADRD and others do not?”

The Alzheimer’s Association [1] and the 2020 Lancet Commission [4] have identified common modifiable risk and resilience factors occurring in mid- and late-life that increase the risk of ADRD. These include (but are not limited to) diabetes, hypertension, head injury, substance abuse, hearing loss, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, physical inactivity, social isolation, obesity, and depression. In prior studies, we examined social determinants of brain health [5] and novel prodromal predictors of ADRD common across diverse cohorts including declining physical functionality [6, 7], depression [8, 9], absence of practice effects [9], and vascular risk factors [10]. We have also studied the protective benefits of cognitive reserve [11], physical activity [12], cognitive activity [13], and mindfulness [14]. However, no single risk factor can account for the resilience or vulnerability of an individual [15]. More likely, an individual’s overall ADRD risk is a complex interaction of genetics, exposures, comorbidities, and lifestyle choices. To address the need for a standardized and validated way of measuring an individual’s resilience and vulnerability, we created the Resilience Index (RI) [16] and Vulnerability Index (VI) [17].

The RI is composed of measures of 6 protective factors (cognitive reserve, physical and cognitive activity, social engagement, dietary patterns, mindfulness) and provides estimates of resilience across participant characteristics, cognitive staging, and ADRD etiologies with a diagnostic odds ratio of 8.9 to discriminate between individuals with and without cognitive impairment [16]. Individuals with high RI scores (&gt;143) had better cognitive, functional, and behavioral ratings than individuals with low RI scores. Within group analyses supported that controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild ADRD with high RI had better cognitive, functional, and global outcomes than those with low RI [16].

The VI is composed of 12 easily obtained sociodemographic and medical factors that can be extracted from electronic health records with a diagnostic odds ratio of 17.1 to discriminate between individuals with and without cognitive impairment [17]. Individuals scoring high on the VI (≥8) had worse health, functional, behavioral, cognitive, and quality of life ratings than those with lower scores. Within group analyses supported that controls and MCI with low VI had better cognitive, functional, and global outcomes than those with high VI [17]. The construction of the VI is similar to the CAIDE [18] which also measures vulnerability of cognitive impairment using cardiovascular risk factors, however they differ in that the VI also incorporates additional factors including race, ethnicity, additional medical history, a measure of depression, and an objective measure of physical functioning.

Although understanding resilience and vulnerability can put risk of impairment in perspective, brief measures of cognitive performance are helpful in order to establish the presence and extent of impairment [19–22]. Changes in executive function may precede episodic memory deficits in the conversion from normal cognition cognitively normal to cognitive impairment, beginning 2–3 years before clinical diagnosis [23, 24] and may be linked to accumulating pathology in pre-clinical and prodromal cases [9, 25, 26] as well as and changes in amyloid PET imaging [27] and plasma biomarkers [28]. Only AD has early prominent episodic memory deficits while nearly all forms of ADRD, including AD, have early executive-attention deficits [23]. However, executive function is a challenging construct to measure, particularly for diverse population screening with differences in cultural cues and educational attainment. Therefore, we developed the number symbol coding test (NSCT), a brief executive measure that captures aspects of attention, decision-making, and set-switching, and can differentiate healthy controls (HC) from MCI, and MCI from mild ADRD with limited bias by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, cognitive reserve, or verbal IQ [11].

While all physicians can diagnose MCI [29] and AD [30] using published criteria, it is much more difficult to assess the status of brain health and identify those at risk for future impairment, particularly at the initial clinical or research evaluation. We therefore developed and validated a novel Brain Health Platform, to quantify brain health and identify risk factors for developing MCI and ADRD, by combining the RI, VI, and NSCT to create an easy-to-perform, comprehensive screening paradigm discriminating low risk asymptomatic individuals from at-risk individuals. We hypothesized that by combining measures of resilience, vulnerability, and performance, the Brain Health Platform could provide a cross-sectional snapshot of overall brain health and provide actionable points to develop precision medicine-like, personalized treatment plans and interventions. We compared the Brain Health Platform against Gold Standard assessments of brain health and ADRD including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [31], neuropsychological testing, and neuroimaging.

METHODS

Study participants

We evaluated 230 participants that attended our center for clinical evaluations or participated in cognitive aging research. The first 190 participants were deeply-phenotyped with detailed examinations including cognitive and neuropsychological testing, assessment of mood and physical performance, physical and neurological examination, and caregiver ratings of participant cognitive abilities, behavior, and function [11, 16, 17, 32]. The remaining 40 participants were part of newer study focusing on screening brain health to differentiate HC from MCI. A waiver of consent was obtained for retrospective review of patient data while prospective research participants provided written informed consent. This study was approved by the University of Miami Institutional Review Board.

Clinical assessment

Clinical assessments for 190 participants were modeled after the Uniform Dataset v3.0 (UDS3) from the National Institute of Aging Alzheimer Disease Research Central program [33, 34]. A physical and neurologic examination was performed. A 45-min test cognitive test battery modeled after the UDSv3.0 battery [34] included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [35], Multilingual Naming Test (naming) [34]; Animal naming (verbal fluency) [34]; Number-span forward/backward (working memory) [34]; and Trailmaking A and B (attention, processing, and executive function). The Hopkins Verbal Learning Task (HVLT) was added as episodic memory for word lists (immediate and delayed recall, and recognition) [36]. The NSCT [11] was added as a test of executive function with a score of 36 or below indicating cognitive impairment. The CDR and its sum of boxes (CDR-SB) [31] was used to determine the presence or absence of dementia and to stage its severity, with higher scores supporting more severe impairment. Mood was assessed with the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [37] providing subscale scores for depression (HADS-D) and anxiety (HADS-A). Participants completed the AD8 [38] and the patient version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) [39] as measure of subjective cognitive performance. Global physical performance was captured with the mini-Physical Performance Test (mPPT) [40] and frailty was assessed with the Fried Frailty Scale [41]. Vascular contributions to dementia were assessed with the modified Hachinski scale [42] and a modified form of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia scale (mCAIDE) [10, 18]. Caregivers completed the informant version of the Quick Dementia Rating System (QDRS) [32] to provide a global rating of cognition. Activities of daily living were captured with the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) [43]. Dementia-related behaviors were measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [44]. These visits took approximately 2 h, and participants were allowed breaks if fatigued.

Clinical assessments in the remaining 40 participants did not include a study partner, thus the CDR, NPI, and caregiver QDRS was not available. Participants self-completed the FAQ to rate their ability to complete activities of daily living. Cognitive evaluations included the AD8 and patient QDRS for subjective measures and the MoCA, NSCT, and computerized testing for objective measures of cognitive performance. These visits took approximately 1 h, and participants were allowed breaks if fatigued.

At the end of all visits, participants were given feedback on performance, results, clinical diagnoses, educational materials, and recommendations for treatment and follow-up care. A licensed clinical social worker was available to assist with advance care planning.

Clinical diagnoses

Consensus diagnoses were determined using the clinical, cognitive, functional, and behavioral data, but not the RI or VI, and applying standardized published criteria for MCI due to AD [29], MCI due to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) [45], AD [30], DLB [46], and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) [47].

Volumetric MRI

A subset of individuals (N = 49) underwent volumetric MRI with NeuroQuant software (CorTechs Labs, San Diego, CA), an FDA-cleared automated quantitative analysis of brain MRI images with normative reference data adjusted for age, sex, and intracranial volume with high correlation to FreeSurfer [48] and visual assessment [49]. Two measures were used in this study as a measure of brain health and a biomarker of neurodegeneration: hippocampal volume and hippocampal occupancy [50].

Resilience Index and Vulnerability Index

The RI [16] was calculated as the sum from 6 factors independently demonstrated to differentiate individuals with normal cognition from individuals with cognitive impairment including cognitive reserve measured as the weighted sum of educational and occupational attainment in the Cognitive Reserve Unit Scale (~1 min) [11], a Likert scale measurement of social interaction and socialization using the Social Engagement Scale (~1 min) [13], physical activity measured with the Quick Physical Activity Rating [12] (~2–5 min), mental activities measured with the Cognitive and Leisure Activity Scale (~2–5 min) [13], brain healthy nutrition patterns with the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) Diet Score Sheet (~ 2–3 min) [51], and the practice of mindfulness measured with the Applied Mindfulness Process Scale (AMPS, ~5–7 min) [52]. The six subscales are totaled to provide the RI with a range of possible scores from 1–378 with higher scores representing greater resilience and better brain health. The RI discriminated individuals with normal cognition from individual with cognitive impairment with an area under the ROC curves (AUC) of 0.836 [0.774, 0.897]. A score of 143 or above on the RI suggests a protective effect against having cognitive impairment with a positive likelihood ratio of 2.4, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.27, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 8.9. The RI alone correctly identified 82% of cognitively normal individuals with 95% accuracy [13].

The VI [17] was derived using machine learning techniques of known ADRD risk factors and calculated as the weighted sum of the presence or absence of 12 risk factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, obesity, frailty, depression, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension) with a range of possible scores from 2–20 with higher scores representing greater vulnerability and worse brain health. The VI takes 2–3 min to complete. The VI discriminated individuals with normal cognition from individual with cognitive impairment with an AUC of 0.844 [0.776, 0.913]. A score of 8 or above on the VI indicates an elevated risk for the presence of cognitive impairment, with a positive likelihood ratio of 4.1, a negative likelihood ratio of 0.24, and a diagnostic odds ratio of 17.1. The VI alone correctly identified 81% of cognitively impaired individuals with 96% accuracy [14].

For the purposes of this study, both a RI below 143 and a VI of 8 or higher are categorized as “High Risk”, while having both an RI of 143 or greater and a VI below 8 are categorized as “Low Risk”. Discordant RI/VI scores are classified as “Intermediate Risk”. The RI and VI have no overlapping information except for low education as a risk in the VI and high educational and occupational attainment to calculate cognitive reserve in the RI.

Selection of the cognitive component

While the combination of both the VI and RI allows for an accurate assessment of both risk and protective factors, a cognitive component is needed to identify degree of current impairment. All 11 cognitive tests used in the neuropsychological evaluation were examined for their individual ability to correctly classify diagnostic status (controls versus MCI versus ADRD). Using BorutaSHAP at five repeats and trained on 35% of total samples, seven tests were chosen for further analysis. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), an approach that uses game theory to explain model performance, evaluated a random forest model that again saw the same 35% of available samples and tested on an additional 15% (70/30 split totaling 50%). Random forests were used as they are a generally robust model for feature selection. From the seven candidates, SHAP identified the HVLT-delayed recall and NSCT as the two best tests for correct classification of diagnostic status (Fig. 1). As our objective was to add a brief assessment of cognitive functioning to combine with the VI and RI, and the HVLT-delayed recall requires a delay of 30 min, the NSCT which takes 90 s was the most optimal cognitive component.

Brain Health Platform

The Brain Health Platform was then created to provide measures of brain health (RI), risk of brain disease (VI), and cognitive performance (NSCT). The Brain Health Platform can be completed in 15–20 minutes by HC and MCI and 20–30 minutes by individuals with ADRD. Rather than provide a sum score, the Brain Health Platform provides an overall assessment of brain health and whether the individual is at low, intermediate or high risk of being cognitively impaired. An online visualization tool is provided to help users determine risk based on each score as well as to envision the spatial relationship of the patient’s scores to other participants in our dataset [53].

Statistical analyses

Analyses were conducted using statistical packages in Python, including pingouin 0.5.0 [54] for inferential statistics; pandas 1.2.4 [55] for descriptive statistics and data manipulation; and scikit-learn 0.24.0 [56], borutashap 1.0.16 [57] and shap 0.40.0 [58] for feature selection (using Boruta) and importance visualization (using SHAP) [59]. Linear discriminant analyses for multiclass discrimination were performed in R v4.2.0. One-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used on continuous data, with Tukey post-hoc tests, and Chi-square test were used to examine categorical variables including diagnostic status (HC, MCI, ADRD), impairment status (impaired vs non-impaired), and combinations of normal or abnormal VI, RI, or NSCT scores based on thresholds. Age was adjusted for as a covariate in ANCOVA and regression models. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were generated using logistic regressions (10-fold cross-validated sets with 10 repetitions) and linear discriminant analyses (5-fold cross-validated sets with 1000 repetitions) for determining impairment versus non-impairment. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to examine each of the three instruments (NSCT, VI, and RI) for the group comparisons between HC versus MCI, HC versus ADRD, and MCI versus ADRD. We also examined the ability of two other brief assessments, the MoCA [34] for cognitive performance, and the mCAIDE [10, 42] for vascular risks as a comparison to the performance of the Brain Health Platform.

RESULTS

Sample characteristics

Participants (n = 230) had a mean age of 73.6 ± 9.9 years (range 38–93) with a mean education of 16.0 ± 2.7 years (range 8–26), 88.3% were non-Hispanic White, and 46.9% were female (Table 1). The sample had a mean MoCA score of 22.0 ± 5.5 (range 3–30) and a mean patient QDRS score of 3.1 ± 3.8 (range 0–24). Consensus diagnoses were 71 HC, 71 MCI, and 88 ADRD cases. For the 71 MCI cases, 49 were due to AD, 14 were due to DLB, and 8 were due to VCID. For the ADRD cases, 35 were due to AD, 46 were due to DLB, and 7 were due to VCID. No significant differences between AD, DLB, and/or VCID etiologies were found for the RI, VI, and NSCT measures used in this study and are hereafter combined as ADRD. After controlling for age, differences were observed for most clinical and cognitive measures between HC, MCI, and ADRD participants (Table 1).

Categorizing ADRD risk with Resilience and Vulnerability Indices

The RI provides a measure of brain health and the VI provides a measure of risk of brain disease. While each are useful individually, combining resilience and vulnerability could paint a clearer picture of brain health in a cross-sectional moment and provide a guide to develop personalized prevention plans to support brain health and identifying asymptomatic individuals for risk of MCI/ADRD.

After correcting for age, individuals in the high-risk group (low RI/high VI) differed significantly from those in the low-risk group (high RI/low VI) in most clinical, cognitive, functional, and psychological assessment assessments (Table 2). Of participants in the low-risk group (high RI/low VI), only 13.5% (5/37) were misclassified as impaired, with 4/5 having a true diagnosis of MCI and one with a true diagnosis of AD. Participants in the high-risk group (low RI/high VI) were correctly classified as impaired 92.2% of the time (106/115). Participants with intermediate risk (high risk on one scale, low risk on the other) were impaired 61.5% of the time (48/78). In most clinical and cognitive assessments, the intermediate risk group either was most like the low-risk group or did not differ significantly from either group. However, the intermediate risk group did significantly differ from both groups in the VI, RI, NSCT, MoCA, HVLT (immediate and delayed recall), and CDR-SB (Table 2) supporting that the RI and VI captures a distinct risk profile.

Addition of performance

Although the RI and VI alone can provide a profile of brain health, the addition of a brief assessment of cognitive performance (i.e., the NSCT) should provide better differentiation of cognitive status. Based on threshold scores, abnormal VI indicates elevated risk of impairment [17], abnormal RI is associated with low resilience [16], and abnormal NSCT suggests cognitive impairment [11]. The addition of the NSCT allows for the examination of current impairment and further reinforces the identification of impairment status as well as allows for discrimination between MCI and ADRD. Comparisons of four groups (Low-risk VI/RI with Normal NSCT, High-risk VI/RI with Normal NSCT, Low-risk VI/RI with Abnormal NSCT, and High-risk VI/RI with Abnormal NSCT) with clinical and cognitive assessments are shown in Table 3. High risk VI/RI with Abnormal NSCT participants significantly differed from the other groups in cognitive performance (MoCA, HVLT immediate and delayed recall, animal naming), FAQ, CDR-SB, and hippocampal occupancy. Further, the High risk VI/RI with Abnormal NSCT group differed significantly from individuals with normal NSCT scores, regardless of VI/RI status in tests of working memory (number span backwards) and executive-attention (trail making test A and B). Performance in the Low risk VI/RI with Abnormal NSCT group typically fell between the High risk VI/RI with Normal NSCT and High risk VI/RI with Abnormal NSCT groups.

Participants with abnormal RI, VI, and NSCT scores were 95.7% likely (88/92) to be impaired at consensus, while participants with normal RI, VI, and NSCT scores were only 9.7% likely (3/31) to be misclassified as impaired (Table 4). Further, when both the VI and RI were abnormal but the NSCT was normal, individuals were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of MCI than ADRD, and when all three were abnormal, individuals were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of ADRD than MCI (p &lt; 0.001). Participants with a normal VI and NSCT but an abnormal RI were significantly less likely to have ADRD, but an abnormal RI alone was unable to discriminate between HC and MCI. Conversely, when both the NSCT and RI were abnormal, participants were significantly more likely to have ADRD. An abnormal VI but normal RI was unable to discriminate between HC and MCI on their own, but the addition of the NSCT revealed that an abnormal NSCT and VI with a normal RI was significantly associated with a diagnosis of MCI, while individuals with a normal NSCT and RI and an abnormal VI were significantly more likely to be HC.

Discriminability

We then tested the ability of the VI, RI, NSCT, and the combined Brain Health Platform to discriminate between individuals with and without cognitive impairment using 10-fold cross-validated logistic regressions and calculated the AUC. The RI alone (AUC = 0.870 [0.860, 0.880]) performed better than the VI alone (AUC = 0.803 [0.790, 0.816]) and similarly to the NSCT alone (AUC = 0.869 [0.861, 0.877]). The combination of the RI and VI increased the AUC to 0.900 [0.891, 0.909], while the addition of the NSCT further increased the AUC to 0.923 [0.916, 0.930]. Linear discriminant analyses revealed that the combined RI-VI-NSCT model significantly classified HC from MCI (AUC = 0.750, [0.740, 0.760]), HC from ADRD (AUC = 0.970 [0.966, 0.974]), and MCI from ADRD (AUC = 0.890 [0.882, 0.898]) (Fig. 2). The combined VI, RI, and NSCT model performed better than the MoCA (AUC = 0.884 [0.875, 0.893]) and the mCAIDE (AUC = 0.768 [0.654, 0.882]) at identifying impairment status.

DISCUSSION

The Brain Health Platform is composed of three brief assessments (VI, RI, and NSCT) generated rapidly by self-report or clinician-observed measures each capturing different aspects of brain health. Individually, the VI, RI, and NSCT examine independent aspects of ADRD risk. The VI identifies known risk factors of current and future impairment, including sociodemographic and comorbid medical conditions linked to ADRD risks, while the RI assesses 6 protective factors that contribute to brain health and cognitive resilience. The NSCT is a cognitive task that quickly and effectively measures aspects of executive functioning (task switching, cognitive speed) affected in most forms of ADRD. Examining the VI, RI, and NSCT together paints a detailed picture of an individual’s susceptibility and resistance to cognitive impairment as well as a snapshot of current cognitive functioning. This makes it possible to quickly and confidently screen for cognitive impairment while enabling differentiation between degrees of impair ment based on the pattern of scores for each measure. The optimal use of the Brain Health Platform would be in (a) primary care offices as screen for cognitive impairment, (b) clinics focusing on brain health and dementia prevention, and (c) research projects interested in information of risk and resilience factors.

We found that the combination of the VI, RI, and NSCT into a single platform is highly effective at identifying prodromal impairment (i.e., MCI), an area where many current screening tools struggle [60]. Based on the scores of the three components, we can accurately identify individuals both as high or low risk for developing impairment, and as a HC, MCI, or ADRD. For the latter, an abnormal NSCT identifies current impairment and an abnormal VI and/or RI narrows that impairment to being likely ADRD-related, based on risk factors highly associated with MCI and ADRD [4]. Abnormal VI and RI scores but normal NSCT may indicate a likelihood of future impairment, or current preclinical dementia, with further testing and/or intervention recommended as a result. Patients with normal NSCT and scores that fall into the normal range of the VI and RI suggest a reduced risk of current or future impairment.

We chose the number-symbol coding task (NSCT) as our cognitive component for this tool as it quickly and effectively measures executive functioning processes (attention, set switching, decision making) which are known to be affected generally in ADRD and is not specific to any one particular etiology. A cognitive component that assesses only memory may function well at identifying AD but might miss DLB or VCID, which are less commonly associated with episodic memory dysfunction in their early stages.

Clinical application of the Brain Health Platform

The Brain Health Platform is intended to be interpreted through the examination of each of the three unique components, the VI, RI, and NSCT, giving the clinician or researcher a general view of the patient’s impairment risk through the quantification of their cognitive resilience, vulnerability to impairment, and a measure of current cognitive functioning. The components examined in each of the Vulnerability and Resilience Indices are shown to be jointly and synergistically associated with impairment risk. The combination of both identified impairment at a greater rate than each individually. Clinical recommendations could thus center around increasing current resilience through health promotion and healthful behavioral change. Similarly, recommendations could focus on mitigating or decreasing vulnerability by maximizing risk reduction and tightly managing comorbid medical conditions. The assessment of current cognitive functioning with the NSCT could enable the clinician or researcher to better determine the presence of absence of impairment and prompt further screening or diagnostic procedures.

Study limitations

Each of the components (VI, RI, NSCT) and the combined platform were developed and validated in an academic setting, where many participants were highly educated and predominantly non-Hispanic White. Validation of the Brain Health Platform in other clinical and research settings, other countries, and in individuals from diverse racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds is needed and is an area of ongoing research. This was a cross-sectional study and associations between the RI, VI, NSCT, and the combined Brain Health Platform with diagnoses need to be tested in a longitudinal fashion to study predictive properties and response to interventions. The Brain Health Platform is designed as a screen for that status of brain health and risk of cognitive impairment. It does not replace a comprehensive neurologic or neuropsychological evaluation. Two cohorts were used in this study; the majority were a deeply-phenotyped clinical sample that had a greater prevalence of MCI and ADRD cases, while the smaller research cohort had a briefer visit that focused on screening for cognitive impairment resulting in a higher proportion of HC. However, the processes for data collection and consensus diagnoses were consistent across both samples except where noted. Incorporation of specific fluid and imaging ADRD biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β protein, tau, phosphorylated tau) may help further characterize participants and are part of ongoing studies. Only AD, LBD, and VCID cases were included in this study. Future studies could explore the Brain Health Platform in cognitive impairments due to other etiologies (e.g., frontotemporal degeneration, traumatic brain injury). Additionally, both the VI and RI were developed using the population examined in this study; validation in independent and diverse populations are necessary and planned.

Strengths of this study include the use of a comprehensive evaluation with extensive characterization of participants and measurement of Gold Standard clinical, cognitive, functional, and behavioral instruments. The Brain Health Platform is brief and can be done prior to a research evaluation or clinical office visit without the need for clinician or staff time, and can be administered regardless of cognitive status and completed by individuals (with or without assistance from their family) through the moderate-to-severe stages of dementia in 15–20 min by most individuals. The Brain Health Platform may be a useful tool for an estimation of brain health, understanding the potential risk of cognitive impairment, exploring vulnerability and resilience in community samples by better understanding the presence of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, and assisting in the design of dementia prevention research and clinical programs.

Conclusion

This study shows that the Brain Health Platform can effectively and accurately identify even the mildest forms of cognitive impairment. The RI and VI are brief yet powerful indices of brain health and risk of MCI and ADRD identifying both modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of impairment, while the NSCT determines current impairment associated with MCI and ADRD. The individual components of the VI and RI are jointly and synergistically associated with impairment risk. The combination of both VI and RI identified impairment at a greater rate than each individually, this was further enhanced with the addition of the NSCT.

The Brain Health Platform can intake the inputs of these three brief assessments and output a patient risk score to determine the cross-sectional sta tus of an individual’s brain health, from which effective, personalized, precision-medicine-like prevention interventions, including lifestyle changes, medications, and clinical trial enrollment, can be implemented in at-risk individuals to decrease the development or progression of cognitive decline. Clinical recommendations should thus aim to both increase current resilience and mitigate or decrease future vulnerability to maximize risk reduction. Future studies will incorporate gold standard biomarkers to identify preclinical assessment capabilities, and longitudinal examination will enable the study and prediction of progression or reversion from HC to MCI and MCI to ADRD.

Fig. 1. Selection of the cognitive component. In addition to vulnerability and resilience, a third dimension of cognitive performance was hypothesized to increase discriminability and better determine risk status. Shapley values were generated using BorutaSHAP for the ability of each of seven brief cognitive assessments to discriminate between Healthy Controls, patients with MCI, and patients with Dementia. The cognitive components examined included the Hopkins verbal learning task immediate recall and delayed recall, the Number-Symbol Coding Task, MoCA total score, Trails A and B, and the animal naming verbal fluency task. The 30-min delayed recall component of the Hopkins verbal learning task was identified as the best performing assessment, followed by the Number-Symbol Coding Task. However, as the purpose of the Brain Health Platform is to quickly and easily generate a risk assessment, the Number-Symbol Coding Task which takes 90 seconds was selected as the most optimal assessment for our purposes.

Examining the Vulnerability Index (VI), Resilience Index (RI), and Number-Symbol Coding Task (NSCT) in a three-dimensional scatterplot allows for the discriminatory power of the Brain Health Platform to be easily visualized. Healthy controls (blue; top right) are concentrated where the RI and NSCT are high and the VI is low, indicating low overall risk. In contrast, in (A) ADRD patients (cyan; bottom left) are concentrated where the RI and NSCT is low and the VI is higher, indicating high overall risk, and individuals with MCI (magenta) predictably fall somewhere in between, with their concentration overlapping both the healthy control and ADRD ellipsoids. In (B) both ADRD and MCI patients are combined to a single “impaired” class. Those outliers that fall outside of the concentrations may suggest either future progression from HC to MCI or MCI to ADRD, if they fall closer to higher risk scores (lower RI and/or higher VI), or a potential to remain stable or even revert, if they fall closer to lower risk scores (lower VI and/or higher RI). As it is inherently difficult to depict a complex three-dimensional figure as a two-dimensional image, we have made an interactive web application available for public viewing at [53] where a subject’s scores in the VI, RI, and NSCT can be drawn onto the plot and compared with the spatial location of other patients.
