Background:

The human chromosome 19q13.32 is a gene rich region and has been associated with multiple phenotypes, including late onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) and other age-related conditions.

Objective:

Here we developed the first humanized mouse model that contains the entire TOMM40 and APOE genes with all intronic and intergenic sequences including the upstream and downstream regions. Thus, the mouse model carries the human TOMM40 and APOE genes and their intact regulatory sequences.

Methods:

We generated the APOE-TOMM40 humanized mouse model in which the entire mouse region was replaced with the human (h)APOE-TOMM40 loci including their upstream and downstream flanking regulatory sequences using recombineering technologies. We then measured the expression of the human TOMM40 and APOE genes in the mice brain, liver, and spleen tissues using TaqMan based mRNA expression assays.

Results:

We investigated the effects of the ‘523’ polyT genotype (S/S or VL/VL), sex, and age on the human TOMM40- and APOE-mRNAs expression levels using our new humanized mouse model. The analysis revealed tissue specific and shared effects of the ‘523’ polyT genotype, sex, and age on the regulation of the human TOMM40 and APOE genes. Noteworthy, the regulatory effect of the ‘523’ polyT genotype was observed for all studied organs.

Conclusion:

The model offers new opportunities for basic science, translational, and preclinical drug discovery studies focused on the APOE genomic region in relation to LOAD and other conditions in adulthood.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The human chromosome 19q13.32 is a gene rich region and has been associated with multiple phenotypes, including: lipid traits [1-4], late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) risk and age-at-onset (AAO) [5-18], cognitive performance [19], longevity [20], cardiovascular risk [21, 22], and the levels of inflammatory markers [23-25]. Thus, 19q13.32 region is characterized by allelic heterogeneity as well as pleiotropy. However, the mechanistic understanding of the heterogenic and pleiotropic roles of this genomic region in human complex traits in adulthood and disease states is still incomplete.

Dysregulation of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, positioned within the 19q13.32 region, has been implicated in the development of several pathologic conditions in adulthood. Foremost, accumulating new evidences have suggested that increased overall expression of APOE plays an important role in the etiology of LOAD (reviewed in [26, 27]). It was suggested that cis-genetic variability contributes to differential APOE gene expression in LOAD [27-30]. Moreover, studies showed LOAD associated differential DNA-methylation [31-35], further support the role of APOE dysregulation in the genetic etiology of LOAD. There are also evidences that changes in APOE expression are involved in other phenotypes. For example, ApoE-deficient transgenic mice developed severe hypercholesterolemia, leading to atherosclerosis [36], systematic inflammation, oxidative injuries, and cardiac dysfunction in response to air pollutants [37]. In addition, the regulation of other genes within the 19q13.32 region has been investigated in the context of human diseases including LOAD. For example, cis-modulation of APOC1 expression was shown to contributes to LOAD susceptibility [38], and increased mRNA levels of translocase of mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOMM40) were reported in LOAD brains and regulated by an intronic poly-T variant [27, 29, 30]. Thus, in-depth exploration of the regional regulation of genes within the 19q13.32 region is important to gain new insights into the heterogenic and pleiotropic role of this region in human health and disease.

While studies using human tissues produced important information related to the regulation of genes at the 19q13.32 region [27-35], these studies are confounded by several covariates some of which, such as genetic background, lifestyle, and environmental influences, could not be control for in the statistical models. Similarly, cell lines and reporters assays advanced our understanding of the gene regulation in this region [28, 30, 39, 40] but must be interpreted cautiously due to inherent shortcomings of in vitro systems and are of limited value in testing factors like age and sex. Humanized mouse models are valuable for complementing investigations of human gene regulation for a candidate locus, as they are predicted to recapitulate the expression patterns observed in human [41]. The advantages include controllable genetic backgrounds and environments, and the opportunity to examine the effects of sex and age in addition to genetic variants on a whole organ and animal level. In this study we aimed to investigate the regulation of two genes within the 19q13.32 region, the human APOE and TOMM40. The existing humanized APOE knock-in mouse was generated by targeted replacement of the mouse-Apoe coding exons 2–4 and intronic sequences with the human counterpart [42]; however, the targeting construct did not include the human noncoding regulatory elements. Thus, here, we developed a new humanized mouse model in which the entire mouse region was replaced with the human (h)APOE and the adjacent hTOMM40 loci including their upstream and down-stream flanking regulatory sequences.

In this study, we utilized our newly developed humanized APOE-TOMM40 mouse model to investigate the effects of age and sex [43], the major risk factors for LOAD and cardiovascular diseases [44], and the effect of the LOAD associated genetic variant ‘523’ polyT [30, 45, 46], on the regulation of the hAPOE and hTOMM40 genes. To consider the major biological pathways, i.e., neurodegeneration, lipid metabolism, and immune response related to APOE and TOMM40 putative functions we performed the analysis using brain, liver, and spleen tissues, receptively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Generation of the targeted replacement humanized TOMM40-APOE mouse model

We took advantage of the homology in the TOMM40-APOE locus between the mouse chromosome 7 and the human chromosome 19 to create mice with the humanized TOMM40-APOE genomic region by targeted replacement [47] (Fig. 1A). We performed a three-step approach involved eliminating the wildtype Tomm40-Apoe region from the mouse genome and replacing it with an acceptor vector, which subsequently was replaced with the human TOMM40-APOR region by exchange vectors. Figure 2 summarizes our strategy.

Creation of the acceptor cassette

The ~20 kb genomic region that contained Tomm40 and Apoe in the mouse BAC RP24-136M6 (derived from the C57BL/6 mouse, Fig. 2A) was exchanged for an acceptor cassette containing Pgk-driven hygromycin and HSV-thymidine kinase genes flanked by heterologous loxP sites (wildtype loxP and mutant lox2272, Fig. 2B). The cassette was flanked by a long arm at the 5’ end and a short arm at the 3’ end for efficient homologous recombination, and a CMV-driven diphtheria toxin gene (DT-TA) upstream of the long arm. The lox sites mark the region of mouse chromosome 7 targeted for replacement by the human genomic DNA. The 5’ wildtype lox site (red) was located just downstream of the polyA site of Pvrl2 gene, and the 3’ mutant lox2272 site (magenta) was located ~1 kb down-stream of the last exon of the mouse Apoe gene and includes the enhancer segment ME.2 site (Fig. 2B), thus encompassing the known promoter and regulatory regions of both human TOMM40 and APOE [40, 48, 49].

Creation of the exchange vectors

The exchange vectors were created by modifying human BAC RP11-84C16 (GenBank AC021988.4, deposited by CHORI), which contains TOMM40, APOE, and flanking sequences. This BAC carries the ‘523’ polyT ‘short’ allele (hereafter S) on an APOE ε4 backbone. To convert the APOE ε4 to APOE ε3, we inserted a selection-counter selection (rpsL/neo) cassette into the BAC at the rs429358 SNP position coding for the APOEe4 arginine (CGC). This cassette was then replaced with an oligonucleotide (80mer) containing the APOE ε3 sequence (TGC). The ‘523’ polyT site was modified by homologous recombination using a primer for T = 15 residues using the same selection/counter selection strategy. The TOMM40-APOE regions from the BACs were then retrieved into plasmids via recombineering/GAP repair, resulting in two exchange vectors with APOE ε3 backbones, one with the S allele at the ‘523’ polyT site (T = 15) and one with the ‘very long’ allele (hereafter VL, T = 30). The retrieving plasmids carried heterologous lox sites and a Pgk-driven neomycin gene flanked by frt sites. The homology arms for retrieving the human genomic region was placed such that the 5’ lox site is ~1 kb down-stream of the last exon of the human APOE gene, including the enhancer segment ME.2 site, thus encompassing the known promoter and regulatory regions of both human TOMM40 and APOE [48] (Fig. 2C).

Targeted replacement

We electroporated C57BL/6 ES cells [line C2, provided by Dr Andras Nagy, Mount Sanai Hospital, Toronto, Fig. 2A, D (lane A)] with the acceptor cassette and verified its homologous integration by Southern blot analysis and PCR [Fig. 2B, D (lanes B), Supplementary Methods]. ES cells harboring the acceptor cassette were electroporated with the exchange vectors, together with a plasmid carrying Cre recombinase. The use of heterospecific lox sites prevented simple excision by limiting recombination to only identical lox sites of the acceptor cassette and the exchange cassette, and allowed directional replacement of the loxP/lox2272 acceptor with the exchange cassette flanked by the identical set of lox sites (Fig. 2C). The correct replacement with the exchange vectors was validated by Southern analysis and PCR [Fig. 2C, D (lanes C-F) Supplementary Methods]. ES cells harboring the human TOMM40-APOE region were used to generate chimeric founders according to standard procedures.

DNA analysis of transgenic mouse lines

Correct insertion of the exchange cassettes and germline transmission of the human TOMM40-APOE region was verified by Southern blotting of genomic DNA extracted from tail clips, and genotype and zygosity was determined by PCR (Supplementary Methods). No further backcrossing was necessary since the founders were already on the C57BL/6 background.

TOMM40 523 polyT (hereafter, ‘523’ polyT) genotypes were determined using a method described previously [50]. In summary, the ‘523’ polyT region of each genomic DNA sample was PCR-amplified using a fluorescently labeled primer. Size of the PCR fragment was determined using an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer and GeneMapper, version 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems). The ‘523’ polyT allele lengths were determined for the 2 genotypic mouse groups: Short (S), 15-Ts; Very Long (VL) 30-Ts [50]. APOE genotypes were confirmed using a standard method based on TaqMan assays [51].

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from brain, liver, and spleen samples (50 mg) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification with a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To note, the spleen samples were immersed in RNAlater™-ICE solution (Thermo Fisher)&gt;24 h prior to extraction. RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm, while the quality of the purified RNA was determined by 260 nm/280 nm ratio. All of the RNA samples were of acceptable quality having ratios between 1.9 and 2.1. Sample quality and the absence of significant degradation products were confirmed by establishing that every sample had RNA Integrity Number (RIN), measured on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, of greater than 7. cDNA was synthesized using MultiScribe RT enzyme (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 10 min at 25°C, 120 min at 37°C, 5 min at 85°C, and hold at 4°C.

Real time PCR

Real-time PCR was used to quantify the levels of human TOMM40 mRNA and APOE mRNA as described previously [30]. Duplicates of each sample were assayed by relative quantitative real-time PCR using the ABI QuantStudio 7 to determine the level of the human TOMM40 and APOE messages relative to the mouse mRNAs for the housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGapdh) and cyclophilin A (mPpia). ABI MGB probe and primer set assays were used to amplify the human TOMM40 cDNA (ID Hs01587378_mH, 146bp) and APOE cDNA (ID Hs00171168_m1, 108bp); and the two RNA reference controls of the mouse endogenous, Gapdh (ID Mm99999915_g1, 109bp) and Ppia (ID Mm02342429_g1, 112bp) (Applied Biosystems). Each cDNA (10 ng) was amplified in duplicate in at least two independent runs (overall ≥ 4 repeats), using TaqMan Universal PCR master mix reagent (Applied Biosystems) and the following conditions: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles; 15 s at 95°C; and 1 min at 60°C. As a negative control for the specificity of the amplification, we used duplicates of no-templates (no-cDNA) in each plate, containing only probes and master mix. No amplification product was detected in control reactions. Data were analyzed with a threshold set in the linear range of amplification. The cycle number at which a sample crossed that threshold (Ct) was then used to determine fold difference, whereas the geometric mean of the two control genes served as a reference for normalization. Fold change was calculated as

2− ΔΔCt; where ΔCt=[Ct(target)-Ct (reference)] and ΔΔCt=[ΔCt(sample)]-[ ΔCt(calibrator)]. For each tissue the calibrator was a dedicated RNA sample used in every plate for normalization within and across runs. For all tissues the calibrators were obtained from S/S female, for brain and spleen 12 months and for the liver 10 weeks old. The variation of the ΔCt values among the calibrator replicates was less than 10%.

Statistical analysis

Duplicate 2−ΔΔCt values for both ApoE and TOMM40 mRNA were averaged and log2 transformed. Six spleen samples were excluded due to suspected RNA degradation. To assess the effect of each factor of interest (age, sex, TOMM40 genotype) adjusted for the other factors as covariates, a main-effects linear regression model was fit with the fixed effects of TOMM40 genotype (homozygous VL or S), sex (male or female), and age (continuous variable, months). Residual plots were observed for lack of fit to test for the statistical adequacy of the model to account for the variation in the data. Interactions between the variables themselves were not formally tested for due to limited power from the relatively small sample size. Multiple comparisons were accounted for by utilizing the False Discovery Rate (Hochberg &amp; Benjamini, 1990) to calculate an FDR-adjusted p value. FDR-adjusted p-value less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant for differences between groups or for main effects. To assess age effects on APOE and TOMM40 mRNA levels stratified by TOMM40 genotype, univariate one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference test (Tukey’s HSD) was performed to test pairwise-differences for sample means by age category. The Tukey’s HSD tests all pairwise differences while controlling the probability of making one or more Type I errors. The analysis was done in contrast to multivariate analysis since the TOMM40-stratified analysis reduces the sample size needed to reliably estimate parameters for the multivariate models. All statistical analysis was performed using JMP version 16.2.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Box plots were made using GraphPad Prism7.

RESULTS

Characterization of the humanized TOMM40-APOE mouse model and tissue samples

The genomic regions encompassing TOMM40 and APOE and surrounding loci are highly conserved between mouse and human (Fig. 1). The order of genes is identical, and the approximate length of the genes is highly similar. The only difference is that in mouse the genes are transcribed from the minus strand of Chr. 7 while in human they transcribed from the plus strand of human Chr. 19 (Fig. 1). This homology facilitated the targeted replacement approach for the creation of the humanized mouse models by replacing the mouse Tomm40-Apoe region with the homologous human genomic region. The exchange vector was constructed by recombineering the human BAC (RP11-84C16) and contained the entire human APOE and TOMM40 genes, the intergenic sequence between the genes (2,106bp) and the flanking upstream (1,117bp) and down-stream (4,513bp) noncoding regions (see Methods, Fig. 2). We generated two homozygous humanized mouse lines carrying a 23,770 bp transgene of the human chr19: 45,393,394-45,417,163 sequence (GRCh37/hg19) that contains the ‘523’ polyT S (15-Ts) or VL (30-Ts) alleles, on the human APOE ε3 backbone, in C57BL/6 mice (see Methods).

The ‘523’ polyT variants, S and VL, reported to be in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the APOE ε3 allele in European ancestry [50]. However, the original human BAC harbors the APOE ε4 allele, thus, we edited SNP rs429358 to modify the APOE ε4 allele to APOE ε3 (see Methods). Consequently, the recombineered BAC clones used to generate the humanized mouse lines reproduce the common native human haplotypes, TOMM40-S/APOE ε3 and TOMM40-VL/APOE ε3. The successful replacement of the entire mouse Tomm40-Apoe region with the human homologous region was confirmed by PCR at F2 generation and the genotypes by published methods [50, 51] (see Methods). Thus, the studied homozygous humanized mouse models express only the human TOMM40 and APOE genes.

Next, we analyzed human (h)APOE and hTOMM40 mRNA expression levels in the brain, liver, and spleen of F2 homozygous humanized mice. The analysis included a total of 81 F2 animals from two mouse lines, representing the two distinct ‘523’ polyT alleles, S and VL, at the ages of 10 weeks, 6, 12, 15, and 18 months (Table 1). The average lifespan of wild-type C57Bl/6J mice is ~ 27 months [52], they reach sexual maturity by 3 months, 6 months is equivalent to human mature adult (20-30 years), at 12 months attained the equivalence of middle age, and 18-month-old mice are at the equivalence of old age. These mice were used for extended quantitative expression analyses at the mRNA level to determine the effects of the ‘523’ polyT genotype, age, and sex on hAPOE and hTOMM40 expression in the context of the human genetic background.

Human APOE and TOMM40 mRNA expression in the brain

To quantify the hAPOE-mRNA and hTOMM40-mRNA levels in transgenic humanized mouse brain (n = 81, Table 1), we employed a quantitative real-time PCR assay specific for the human transcripts. All levels were measured relative to the mouse endogenous reference genes, Gapdh and Ppia, by 2−ΔΔCt. To study the effect of the ‘523’ polyT homozygote genotypes, age, and sex on hAPOE and hTOMM40 expression levels we log2 transformed the expression fold change (lg2FC) and performed statistical analysis by fitting the general linear model with all covariates, ‘523’ polyT genotype (S/S or VL/VL), sex (M/F), and age (continuous months) (Supplementary Figure 1). No interactions were identified between the factors upon inspection of bivariate plots of the fixed effects.

For hAPOE-mRNA, we found significant effects of ‘523’ polyT and age (FDR-adjusted p = 3.1x10−10, 0.0040, respectively; Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figure 1). The S/S brains showed significantly higher hAPOE expression in comparison to the VL/VL brains (Fig. 3A). In addition, mice at the age of 18 months exhibited significant increase in brain hAPOE levels compared to other age groups (Fig. 3B). Since the 18 months group comprised of S/S animals only, we examined the age effect for each ‘523’ polyT genotypic group, the S/S brains demonstrated significantly higher hAPOE-mRNA in 18-month versus each of the other age groups (p = 0.046, 0.042, and 0.077; 10 weeks, 6 and 12 months, Fig. 3C, Supplementary Table 2), while the VL/VL brains showed a trend of positive correlation, but not significant, of increased hAPOE-mRNA with age (Fig. 3D, Supplementary Table 3). hTOMM40-mRNA levels were significantly affected by the ‘523’ polyT (FDR-adjusted p = 6.9x10−5, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 2), showing an increased hTOMM40-mRNA expression in the S/S versus the VL/VL brains (Fig. 3E), similar to the genotypic effect on the hAPOE transcripts.

Human APOE and TOMM40 mRNA expression in the liver

We utilized the same approach and statistical analysis to evaluate the effects of ‘523’ polyT genotype, sex, and age on hAPOE and hTOMM40 transcripts in the liver (n = 79, Table 1). Sex showed a significant effect on hAPOE-mRNA expression in the liver (FDR-adjusted p = 0.0045, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 3), with higher levels in females compared to male (Fig. 4A). For hTOMM40-mRNA we observed significant effect of 523’ polyT genotype (FDR-adjusted p = 0.00012, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 4) whereas the VL/VL livers exhibited higher levels vs the S/S livers (Fig. 4B), contrary to the direction of the genotypic effect in the mouse brains.

Human APOE and TOMM40 mRNA expression in the spleen

Examination of the hAPOE and hTOMM40 mRNAs in the spleen (n = 74, Table 1) was performed to assess the effects of the same factors, i.e., ‘523’ polyT genotype, sex, and age using the same methodology. We found that hAPOE-mRNA is significantly affected by the 523’ polyT genotype (FDR-adjusted p = 5.5x10−8, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 5) with the VL/VL spleens showing higher levels vs the S/S (Fig. 5A). The hTOMM40-mRNA was affected by both the ‘523’ polyT genotype and age (FDR-adjusted p = 2.1x10−5 and 0.00059, respectively), Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 6). Similar to the liver, the VL/VL spleens exhibited significant increased levels of hTOMM40-mRNA (Fig. 5B). Age also showed a significant effect on hTOMM40 expression (p = 0.00059), specifically, higher levels in 15 and 18 months compared to the younger age groups (Fig. 5C). When stratified by the ‘523’ polyT genotype groups, the S/S spleens showed significant increased hTOMM40-mRNA in 18 months compared to all other age groups (p &lt; 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons, Fig. 5D, Supplementary Table 4), and the VL/VL spleens showed a non-significant trend of positive correlation of increase in hTOMM40 expression with age (Fig. 5E, Supplementary Table 5).

DISCUSSION

In this study we generated the first humanized mouse model that contains the entire TOMM40 and APOE genes with all intronic and intergenic sequences including the upstream and downstream regions. Thus, the mouse model carries the human TOMM40 and APOE genes and their intact regulatory sequences. These genes are involved in various human traits and this genomic region has been associated with multiple phenotypes. Thus, our new mouse model is valuable for research of human traits and diseases in adulthood and useful for basic science, translational, and preclinical studies in the drug discovery pipeline.

For example, accumulating evidence suggested that APOE holds promise as an emerging therapeutic target for LOAD [26]. Previously we found significant higher levels of APOE-mRNA in brain tissues obtained from ε3/ε3 LOAD patients compared to ε3/ε3 healthy donors, consistently with other reports showing elevated levels of APOE-mRNA in LOAD brains [30, 53-55]. In addition, new single-nucleus (sn)RNA-seq datasets showed LOAD changes in APOE expression in glia cell-types, in particular upregulation in microglial subpopulations [56-58]. Moreover, studies using the APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed that lowering ApoE protein levels ameliorated cognitive dysfunctions and Aβ pathology [59] independent of the APOE allele [60-62]. There are clear changes in APOE expression associated with LOAD and independent of the ε4 allele [62] suggesting that regulation of APOE expression may impact the risk to develop LOAD, making the modulation of the overall ApoE protein levels useful as a future therapeutic target. Our new ‘humanized’ mouse model will serve an important resource for preclinical studies evaluating different approaches targeting APOE towards the establishment of in vivo proof-of-concept.

The previously existing humanized APOE knock-in mice are available for both the human ε3 and ε4 isoforms, expressing either the human ApoE4 or ApoE3 proteins, respectively [42]. The developed humanized mouse is homozygotes for the ε3 allele. While the ε4 allele can be introduced via genome editing, the ε3/ε3 model offers the opportunity for studies that focus on the exploration of factors other than ε4 on human conditions in adulthood in a controlled experimental design. The remarkable advantage of our model stems from the of the extent size of the replaced genomic region. The former model was generated by targeted replacement of the mouse-Apoe coding exons 2–4 and intronic sequences with the human counterpart [42]; however, the targeting construct did not include the human noncoding regulatory elements. The expression of the genes in the TOMM40-APOE-APOC1 cluster is under complex regulation and multiple enhancer elements embedded within this genomic region regulate tissue- and cell-specific and hormonal- and metabolite-mediated regulation [40, 48, 49, 63-69]. For example, DNA methylations within two such elements of the APOE gene control tissue-, cell-, and genotype-specific APOE and TOMM40 expression [31, 70]. In addition, previously we showed the role of PPARγ in the regional regulation of genes mapped within this cluster [39]. Our model contains the human APOE and TOMM40 genes including their upstream and downstream flanking regulatory sequences, thus, facilitating exploration of regional gene regulatory network. Here we tested the effect of age, sex, and ‘523’polyT, factors that implicated in LOAD risk and other adulthood conditions. We found that the effects of sex and age are tissue specific whereas the effect of the 523’ polyT genotype was more general and impacted both APOE and TOMM40 genes.

Most of the AD research focuses on the brain and the central nervous system. Here we provided insights into the periphery building on the hypothesis that AD is a systemic disease. Particularly, we studied the liver and spleen related to lipid metabolism and immune response pathways, respectively, that have been associated with AD. The liver is involved in many AD pathogenesis pathways, including oxidative stress and lipid metabolism [71], and is a major source of peripheral ApoE [72]. The liver is responsible for the metabolism of more than 60% of Aβ peptide and its functional impairment could enhance AD pathology [73]. Additionally, examination of APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed that the liver is the earliest organ impacted by amyloid pathology [74]. Furthermore, levels of triglycerides, HDL-Cs, and glucose associated with AD are circulated and processed by the liver [75, 76].Recent studies using mice with humanized-livers harboring the ε4/ε4 or ε3/ε3 genotypes suggested a role for the liver in brain phenotypes [77, 78]. Giannisis et al. demonstrated associations between the APOE ε4 liver genotype and various unfavorable changes in markers of synaptic integrity, neuroinflammation, and insulin signaling suggesting that hepatic ApoE plays a role in the APOE ε4-associated risk of AD [77]. Kessler et al. found associations between plasma ApoE3 levels, behavior, and cognition and suggested that a humanized liver might be sufficient to induce mouse behavioral and cognitive phenotypes [78]. Similarly, the spleen and the immune system have been also implicated in AD pathology in multiple studies using human tissues and mouse models [79-84]. Thus, it is important to understand the regulation of the strongest genetic locus associated with LOAD in these organs.

Our study presents a new model for AD research as well as the investigations of other pleiotropic human complex traits associated with aging. The outcomes support the role of age and sex in the regional dysregulation of genes within the APOE LD region that potentially mediates the risk for LOAD and other age-related conditions. Furthermore, our result highlighted a mechanistic role of the ‘523’ polyT variants. We provide the opportunity to utilize our TOMM40-APOE humanized model in diverse and multidisciplinary studies related to human health and aging.

B) The mouse genomic region after the exchange with an acceptor cassette containing Pgk-driven hygromycin and HSV-thymidine kinase genes flanked by heterologous loxP sites, wildtype loxP (red, located just downstream of the polyA site of Pvrl2 gene) and mutant lox2272 (magenta, located ~1 kb downstream of the last exon of the mouse Apoe gene). The cassette was flanked by a long arm at the 5’ end and a short arm at the 3’ end, and a CMV-driven diphtheria toxin gene (DT-TA) upstream of the long arm. C) The ‘humanized’ mouse genomic region resulted from successful targeted replacement carrying the hTOMM40-hAPOE genes, and the native human sequences upstream and downstream of these genes and the intergenic region. D) PCR analysis of ES cell clones after cassette exchange between targeting vector and acceptor cassette. ES of mouse wild type (lane A), ES with the acceptor cassette (lane B), ES heterozygotes for the ‘523’ polyT S allele (lanes C-F, upper band) together with the mouse native allele (lanes C-F, lower band).

Fig. 3. Human APOE and TOMM40 mRNA expression in mouse brain tissue.

Fold levels of human (h)APOE and hTOMM40 mRNA were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR and calculated relative to endogenous mouse Gapdh and Ppia expression using the 2−ΔΔCt method. A) The homozygous ‘523’ polyT S genotype was associated with significant elevated hAPOE-mRNA levels compared to the VL/VL genotype (p = 3.2x10−10; NVL =30; NS =51). B) Age was significantly associated with hAPOE-mRNA levels (p = 0.0040). Mice at 18 months (N18-month =14) expressed significantly more hAPOE than other age groups (N10-wks=13, N6-month=24, N12-month=24, N15-month=6). C) Mice homozygous for the ‘523’ polyT S allele demonstrated significantly higher hAPOE-mRNA levels at 18 months (N18-mooth=14) than other age groups (p = 0.042, 0.046 and 0.077; N10-wks=13, N6-month =12, N12-month=12, respectively). D) Mice homozygous for the ‘523’ polyT VL allele demonstrated a non-significant increase in hAPOE-mRNA levels with age (N6-month=12, N12-month =12, N15-month=6). E) The homozygous ‘523’ polyT S genotype was associated with significant elevated hTOMM40-mRNA levels compared to the VL/VL genotype (p = 6.9x10−5).

Fig. 4. Human APOE and TOMM40 mRNA expression in mouse liver tissue.

Fold levels of hAPOE and hTOMM40 mRNA were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR and calculated relative to endogenous mouse Gapdh and Ppia expression using the 2−ΔΔCt method. A) Female mice expressed significantly higher levels of hAPOE-mRNA levels than males (p = 0.0045; NF =40, NM =39). B) The homozygous ‘523’ polyT VL genotype was associated with significant elevated hTOMM40-mRNA levels compared to the S/S genotype (p&lt;=0.0001; NVL =30; NS =49).

Fig. 5. Human APOE and TOMM40 mRNA expression in mouse spleen tissue.

Fold levels of hAPOE and hTOMM40 mRNA were assayed by real-time RT-qPCR and calculated relative to endogenous mouse Gapdh and Ppia expression using the 2−ΔΔCt method. A) The homozygous ‘523’ polyT VL genotype was associated with significant elevated hAPOE-mRNA levels compared to the S/S genotype (p = 5.5x10−8; NVL =31, NS =48). B) The homozygous ‘523’ polyT VL genotype was associated with significant elevated hAPOE-mRNA levels compared to the S/S genotype (p = 2.1x10−5). C) Age was significantly associated with hTOMM40-mRNA expression (p = 0.00059). Mice 15 and 18 months (N18 =13) expressed more hTOMM40-mRNA than other age groups (N10 = 13, N6 = 24, N12 = 23, N15 = 6). D) Mice that were homozygous for the ‘523’ polyT S allele showed significantly higher hTOMM40-mRNA at 18 months (N18-month=13) than other age groups (p &lt; 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons; N10-wks=13, N6-month=12, N12-month=10). E) Mice homozygous for the ‘523’ polyT VL allele demonstrated an increase in hTOMM40-mRNA levels with age (N6-month=12, N15-month =13, N15-month =6) that was not statistically significant.
