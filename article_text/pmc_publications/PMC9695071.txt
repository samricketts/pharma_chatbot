The widely studied triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse provides a robust model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with region dependent patterns of progressive amyloid-β (Aß) and tau pathology. Using diffusion MRI (dMRI), we investigated the sensitivity of dMRI measures in capturing AD pathology associated microstructure alterations in older 3xTg-AD mice, and the degree to which dMRI changes correlate with measurements of Aβ and tau pathology. 3xTg-AD and normal control (NC) mice, 15 to 21 months of age, were used in this study. In vivo dMRI data were acquired for the generation of diffusion tensor (DT) and diffusional kurtosis (DK) measures within the hippocampus and fimbria (Fi). For these same brain regions, Aβ and tau pathology were quantified by morphological analysis of Aß1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity. Two-tailed, two-sample t-tests were performed to assess group differences in each brain region of interest (ROI), with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method being applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to investigate associations between diffusion and morphological measures. Our results revealed, depending on the brain region, DT and DK measures were able to detect group differences. In the dorsal hippocampus (HD), fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly higher in the 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. In the subiculum (SUB), FA, axial diffusivity (D∥) and radial kurtosis (K⊥) were significantly higher in 3xTg-AD mice compared with NC mice. Morphological quantification of Aß1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity showed elevated Aß and tau in the Fi, ventral hippocampus (HV) and SUB of 3xTg-AD mice. The presence of Aβ and tau was significantly correlated with several DT and DK measures, particularly in the SUB, where an increase in tau correlated with an increase in mean kurtosis (MK) and K⊥. This work demonstrates significant dMRI differences between older 3xTg-AD and NC mice in the hippocampus and Fi. Significant correlations were found between dMRI and morphological measures of Aβ and tau pathology. These results support the potential of dMRI-derived parameters as biomarkers of AD pathology. Since the imaging methods employed here are easily translatable to clinical MRI, our results are also relevant for human AD patients.

3xTg-AD mouse
Alzheimer’s disease

pmc1. Introduction

The triple transgenic 3xTg-AD mouse is one of the most studied mouse models of AD [1]. This model possesses three mutations in homologous mouse genes associated with human familial Alzheimer’s disease (APP Swedish, MAPT P301L, and PSEN1 M146V) [2]. It develops both amyloid-β (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles in a temporal and spatial pattern similar to human AD pathology [3–6]. These mice exhibit synaptic plasticity dysfunction, including long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits that occur prior to extracellular Aβ deposition, having cognitive impairment around 3–4 months of age. Both Aβ and tau exhibit age- and region-dependent formation in these mice, with Aβ plaques appearing prior to tangles, which are extensive in older transgenic mice.

Another important feature described in 3xTg-AD mice is the presence of abnormal myelination patterns, with changes in oligodendrocyte and myelin marker expression, leading to white matter (WM) disruption in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex as early as 2 months of age [7,8]. These WM changes are followed by the first signs of cognitive impairment, detected even before Aβ plaques appear [8]. Additionally, in this transgenic model, Perez et al. [9] described an age-related hippocampal and cortical cholinergic neuritic dystrophy in parallel with the progression of AD pathology. They also reported an age-related reduction in the number of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (CBF) of these mice. Notably, this age-related reduction in the number of CBF neurons was apparently due to the greater number of these neurons found in the young 3xTg-AD mice.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion MRI (dMRI), is a powerful method for probing brain microstructure abnormalities and is widely used as a noninvasive tool for detecting changes in age- and AD-associated WM integrity [10,11]. Diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) is an extension of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that includes dMRI data acquired with stronger diffusion weightings than is typical for DTI [12,13] and requires at least 2 different nonzero b-values. In this way, DKI provides all the diffusion measures available with DTI plus additional measures related to the kurtosis of the water diffusion displacement probability density function. These kurtosis measures quantify the extent to which water diffusion is non-Gaussian and are closely associated with the degree of tissue microstructural complexity [14].

Previously, we have shown that dMRI is able to detect the early myelin abnormalities described in this AD mouse, particularly in the hippocampus, fimbria and fornix of 2-month-old 3xTg-AD mice [15]. Additionally, we demonstrated that dMRI measures are able to capture the larger number of cholinergic neurons reported in the BF of these young 3xTg-AD mice [16]. Moreover, we found that dMRI metrics change longitudinally with aging [16] and AD pathology progression [17] in several brain regions. However, we have not yet established the morphological correlation between the AD pathology and the dMRI changes we reported for this AD mouse model. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of DTI and DKI in detecting AD pathology induced microstructure alterations in the hippocampus and fimbria of 15–21 month-old 3xTg-AD mice and to determine how changes in dMRI measures would correlate with markers of Aβ and tau pathology.

2. Methods

2.1 AD mouse model

All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), and they were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A total of thirteen 3xTg-AD (TG) and eleven normal control (NC) mice were imaged at 15 (TG, n=6; NC, n=3), 18 (TG, n=5; NC, n=4) and 21 (TG, n=2; NC, n=4) months of age. The TG [B6;129-Psen1tm1Mpm Tg(APPSwe, tauP301L)1Lfa/Mmjax; MMRRC Stock No: 34830-JAX|3xTg-AD] and age-matched NC [101045 B6129SF2/J] mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). The NC mice are the recommended controls for genetically engineered strains generated with 129-derived embryonic stem cells and maintained on a mixed B6;129 background. Only female mice were used in this study since the development of AD pathology is far less pronounced and more variable in male 3xTg-AD mice [18,19]. All mice were housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 AM) in an accredited animal care facility. Following the MRI scan, mice were sacrificed for morphological analysis of the degree of Aβ and tau pathology.

2.2 MRI acquisition

Imaging acquisition was performed as previously reported [16]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using an isoflurane vaporizer set at the following percentages: 3% for induction, 2% during pilot scanning and data acquisition. After induction, mice were placed in a mouse holder and restrained using a mouse tooth bar (Bruker, T10146) and ear bars (Bruker, T10147) placed in the auditory canal. Compressed air was used as the carrier gas and delivered at a flow rate of 1L/min into a nose cone positioned around the tooth bar, where gases mixed with air and passed over the rodent’s nose. All animals were maintained at 37.0 ± 0.2 °C and respiration ranged between 60 and 80 breaths per minute during scanning.

The in vivo MRI experiments were all performed on a 7T 30 cm bore scanner (Bruker, BioSpec 70/30 USR) running Paravision version 5.1. An 86 mm 1H quadrature volume coil (T128038) was used for signal transmission and an actively decoupled phase array coil (four channel receiver T11765) was used for signal reception. A 2-shot SE-EPI dMRI sequence was employed for the DKI acquisition [33, 34]. Imaging parameters were: TR/TE = 3750/34.4 ms, δ/Δ = 5/18ms, slice thickness = 0.7 mm, 15 slices with no gap, data matrix = 128×128, image resolution = 156×156 μm2, 2 signal acquisitions, 10 b-value = 0 (b0) images, followed by 30 diffusion encoding gradient directions with 4 b-values for each gradient direction (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 ms/μm2) and fat suppression flip angle = 105°. Total acquisition time = 33 min.

2.3 dMRI post-processing and Image analysis

The post-processing of the diffusion data was performed using DKE [20] (http://nitrc.org/projects/dke). Post-processing included motion correction by aligning all DWIs to the first b=0 image using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, UK). A principal component analysis approach [21] and the method of moments [22] were used to reduce the effects of signal noise on the dMRI data. Parametric maps were obtained by fitting dMRI signal measurements to the DKI signal model for each voxel using a linearly constrained weighted linear least squares fitting algorithm, which generated the diffusion and kurtosis tensors. These two tensors were then used to calculate parametric maps for all diffusion metrics [12,13]. Figure 1 illustrates (a) the MRI slice selection, (b) a representative fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of a 15-month-old TG mouse exemplifying the selected regions of interest (ROI), and (c) all diffusion metric maps from both NC and TG mouse. In our analysis, we considered the four diffusion tensor (DT) parameters of mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (D∥), radial diffusivity (D⊥) and fractional anisotropy (FA). MD corresponds to the diffusivity averaged over all diffusion directions, D∥ corresponds to the diffusivity in the direction of the principal diffusion tensor eigenvector, D⊥ corresponds to the diffusivity averaged over all diffusion directions perpendicular to the principal diffusion tensor eigenvector, and FA quantifies the anisotropy of the diffusion tensor. We similarly considered the four diffusional kurtosis (DK) metrics of mean kurtosis (MK), axial kurtosis (K∥), radial kurtosis (K⊥), and kurtosis fractional anisotropy (KFA). These are kurtosis analogs of the DT metrics that quantify diffusional non-Gaussianity and provide complementary information about the diffusion dynamics [14, 23]. All four b-values (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 ms/μm2), for each gradient direction, were used in calculating all the diffusion parameters. It is worth noting that, due to the inclusion of non-Gaussian effects, DKI yields more accurate estimates of DT metrics than does conventional DTI [24], as well as enabling a more comprehensive assessment of the diffusion microenvironment in brain tissue.

As seen in Figure 1-b, ROIs were defined for hippocampus [including dorsal (HD), ventral (HV) and subiculum (SUB) areas] over four slices and fimbria (Fi) over three slices. All ROIs were manually drawn on the averaged b0 image by a neuropathologist (MFF), using ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij//) [25]. Delineation of ROIs was guided by comparison of anatomical structures in the MRI slices with a standard mouse atlas [24] and verified using the FA maps to ensure correct anatomical location while avoiding contamination of unintended tissue or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To avoid bias in the ROIs, all the mice identification numbers were randomly assigned, and the number of MRI slices sampled was consistent across mice. The regional values for the dMRI measures were obtained by averaging all voxels within an ROI except those with MD &gt; 1.5 μm2/ms, which were excluded to minimize the effect of CSF contamination.

2.4 Histological protocol

Following the MRI scan, mice from each group were perfused with 1x ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by paraformaldehyde (4%) in PBS. Mouse brains were then removed and post-fixed overnight in the same fixative, and subsequently transferred to a storage buffer PBS with 0.02% sodium azide until final processing by NeuroScience Associates (Knoxville, TN, USA) using MultiBrain® technology. Brains were freeze-sectioned at 25 μm in the coronal plane and consecutive sections at the level of the hippocampus were stained free-floating for amyloid (Aß1-42 with a neutral red counterstain; BioLegend - Catalog#: 805504) and phosphor-Tau (AT8 with light thionine counterstain; ThermoScientific -Catalog#: MN1020B) to measure the presence and degree of Aß and tau pathology. The slices were digitized in one session using an Olympus BX53 microscope (Olympus Corporation of the Americas, Center Valley, PA) with QImaging digital camera and QCapture Suite. Images (4x magnification) were acquired under the same image light and camera settings to avoid possible image intensity variation. RGB (red, green, blue) images were then split in 3 color channels; the red channel was chosen for the quantification of Aß1-42 stain, the blue channel was chosen for the quantification of AT8 stain, and then saved as 8-bit grayscale images. All ROIs were manually drawn by a neuropathologist (MFF) on each digital image in both hemispheres. ROIs were drawn, based on the mouse brain atlas [24] on the same regions as for the dMRI data, using ImageJ software. Quantification of the immunoreactivity for both Aß1-42 and AT8 was done by subtracting the background stain and averaging the mean grayscale intensity measurements from all pixels in each ROI, and values were expressed as optical density (OD) = log (max intensity/mean intensity), where max intensity = 255 for the 8-bit images.

2.5 Statistical analyses

Summary statistics are expressed as group-averaged means ± standard error of the mean (SE) for both dMRI metrics and histological measurements. Two-tailed, two-sample t-tests were performed to assess group differences in each ROI. The Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method [25] was used to adjust for multiple testing of DT (N = 4) and DK (N = 4) parameters within each ROI. Here the DT and DK parameters are regarded as different categories to facilitate comparison with prior DTI studies. We also reported the effect size (Cohen’s d) for each dMRI metric when comparing 3xTg-AD and NC mice. To evaluate the potential of the dMRI metrics as possible markers for the presence of amyloid and tau pathology, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between the dMRI metrics and the morphology measures; no adjustment for multiple comparison corrections was done. Due to the small number of mice at each time point, mice from all time points and from both groups, were pooled for statistical analysis, and age dependent changes were not assessed. A p-value of ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

3. Results

In this study we investigated the sensitivity of dMRI in detecting AD pathology by correlating changes in dMRI parameters with markers of Aβ and tau pathology in the hippocampus and fimbria. The hippocampus, because it is one of the brain areas significantly affected by AD pathology, and fimbria, which is an efferent white matter pathway of the hippocampus and most likely would reflect changes in the hippocampus microstructure.

Table 1 shows the group means, standard error of the mean (SE), unadjusted p values (bold indicates values that remain significant after FDR correction) and Cohen’s d, for the DT (a) and DK (b) metrics from all ROIs. Figure 2 shows representative morphological slices of (a) Aß1-42 and (b) AT8 immunoreactivity for both NC and TG mice in the Fi and SUB, respectively. Figure 3 presents the quantitative results for the Aß1-42 and AT8 measurements.

Our results show that dMRI metrics are associated with pathology induced brain microstructure alterations and group differences, even with the relatively small number of mice in each group. As shown in Table1, in the HD, FA values are significantly higher in the TG mice compared with NC mice; there is also a trend for higher D∥, which did not reach statistical significance after FDR correction. In the SUB, FA, D∥ and K⊥ are significantly higher in the TG mice compared with NC mice. Additionally, there are trends for higher FA in the HV, K∥ in the Fi, and KFA in the SUB for the TG group, but which did not reach statistical significance after adjusting for multiple testing.

Morphological quantification of Aß1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity, as seen in Figure 3, shows statistically significant group differences, with increases of Aß and tau in the Fi, HV and SUB of TG mice. In the HD only Aß was significantly increased in the TG mice compared with controls. We note that values for the NC group does not reach zero due to residual background stain, but as expected and shown in Figure 2, Aß1-42 and AT8 immunoreactivity was not present in NC mice. The presence of Aβ and tau was significantly correlated with several dMRI metrics, as seen in Figure 4 (unadjusted p values), which shows the correlations that were statistically significant (in bold) or had a trend to be correlated in each region.

4. Discussion

The 3xTg-AD mouse used in the current study provides a robust model of progressive region dependent Aß and tau pathology, with evident and sustained accumulation of plaques and tangles after 12 months of age [5, 6, 28]. Therefore, this model is well-suited to investigate the potential relationships between AD pathological features and dMRI measurements.

Our dMRI results reveal group differences between older TG and NC mice in brain regions having AD pathology, particularly in the HD and SUB. As seen in Table 1, the increase of FA in the HD and SUB, and the increase K⊥ in the SUB of TG mice were the best differentiators between the two groups in these regions. These differences reflect changes in the diffusion environment associated with the presence of Aβ aggregates and phosphorylated tau. They may also be related to the growing number of dystrophic neurites (axonal swelling/beading/fragmentation) and axonal loss seen with AD pathology progression in the hippocampus.

In our morphological analysis (Fig. 2 and 3), as previously described [3–6, 28], Aβ plaque and tau pathology are evident in 15-month-old TG mice, and significantly increased with age (online supplementary Fig.1 and 2). Mostly importantly, Aβ and tau pathology is significantly correlated with several of the dMRI metrics. Extracellular Aβ aggregates changes the geometry of the extracellular space, creating more barriers, increasing the tissue heterogeneity, and leading to restriction of the diffusion environment. The presence of the intracellular tau pathology has a multifaceted contribution to the diffusion changes. Intracellular tau causes axonal clogging, leading to axonal diffusion restriction, but ultimately tau pathology results in neuronal degeneration and increase in diffusivity. As seen in Figure 4, extracellular Aβ plaques in the Fi correlates with a decrease in D∥ and an increase K∥, while the presence of the intracellular tau pathology correlates with an increase K∥. In the hippocampus, the presence of tau pathology in the HD leads to an increase of K∥, and the presence of Aβ plaques in the HV leads to an increase of KFA. In the SUB, the presence of Aβ plaques correlates with an increase in K⊥, and the accumulation of phosphorylated tau correlates with an increase in FA, D∥, MK and K⊥. The correlation graphs in the Sub (Fig.4) also illustrate the inherent heterogeneity with which the AD pathology is expressed in the TG group. The increase of FA and KFA in the hippocampus may be related to the progressive loss of cholinergic unmyelinated axons [9], resulting in a more aligned, anisotropic environment. However, we emphasize that the connections between dMRI measures and microstructure are complex and hence difficult to fully explicate, particularly when taking in account changes occurring with the progressive pathological process seen in AD. At 15 months, intense pathology is present in the TG mice, which includes not only Aβ plaques and tau, but also confounding factors, such as, myelin damage, axonal degeneration, axonal loss, and an inflammatory reaction with reactive microglia and astrocytes [29, 30]. Therefore, several biological processes may contribute to the dMRI changes reported here. A more detailed morphological characterization with multiple morphological markers for myelin damage, axonal loss and inflammatory cells, with quantitative correlations between dMRI and morphology findings, could be of value in clarifying the relative sensitivity dMRI to these various tissue alterations.

Our dMRI results are generally consistent with those reported using other mouse models of AD [31–35]. For the 3xTg-AD mouse, only a few prior dMRI studies have been published using mice having a substantial range of ages. Employing DTI, Kastyak-Ibrahim et al. [36] observed no WM differences in older (11–17 months of age) 3xTg-AD mice relative to controls. Snow et al. [37] found lower in FA and D∥ in the hippocampus of 12–14-month-old 3xTg AD mice, and recently, Manno et al. [38] reported higher FA and lower D⊥ in the cortex of 2-month-old 3xTg-AD mice compared with controls. Furthermore, in addition to those from our group [15–17], only 2 previous studies [39, 40] have used DKI to examine AD mouse models, focusing mostly on gray matter regions in the APP/PS1 mouse and showing an overall elevation of MK and K∥ within the cortex. Non-Gaussian diffusion is typically a consequence of barriers and compartments, and higher kurtosis values imply greater diffusional heterogeneity [12–14]. The elevated kurtosis values found by us and other studies are thus not surprising. Nonetheless, it should be noted that other microstructural changes associated with AD pathology, such as neurodegeneration, may tend to lower the kurtosis.

One important limitation of our study is the relatively small total number of mice, particularly those at latter ages, which reduced the statistical power of the data analysis. For the Spearman correlations, mice from all time points and from both groups were pooled for statistical analysis. Further studies are needed to investigate the correlations between age-associated AD pathology and dMRI changes; therefore, these results should be cautiously interpreted. Additionally, due to the variability of the degree of AD pathology described in this model [4, 6, 26], large ROIs, as used for the HD and HV, may have attenuated some effects. This is an inherent methodological limitation of our dMRI data acquisition since the imaging resolution is not sufficient to discriminate with confidence the CA1 and CA3 regions as needed for a more refined comparison with morphology.

5. Conclusion

In summary, we have demonstrated significant dMRI differences in older 3xTg-AD, in comparison to NC mice, which were significantly correlated with Aβ and tau pathology in the hippocampus and Fi of the 3xTg-AD group. Therefore, our results support the potential of dMRI parameters as biomarkers of AD pathology. Since the imaging methods employed here are easily translatable to clinical MRI, the results of this study are also relevant to human AD.
