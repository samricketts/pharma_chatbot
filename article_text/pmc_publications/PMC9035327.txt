CONTEXT:

Pain is a significant concern among older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).

OBJECTIVES:

Examine the association between cognitive impairment across the ADRD spectrum and pain assessment and treatment in community-dwelling older Americans.

METHODS:

This cross-sectional, population-based study included 16,836 community-dwelling participants ≥ 50 years in the 2018 Health and Retirement Study. ADRD, assessed by validated cognitive measures, was categorized into “dementia”, “cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND)” and “intact cognition”. Pain assessment included pain presence (often being troubled with pain), pain severity (degree of pain most of the time [mild/moderate/severe]), and pain interference (pain making it difficult to do usual activities). Pain treatment included recent use of over-the-counter pain medications and opioids (past 3 months), and regular intake of prescriptions for pain.

RESULTS:

Dementia were associated with lower likelihood of reporting pain presence (Odds Ratio [OR]= 0.61, p=0.01), pain interference (OR=0.46, p&lt;0.001), reporting lower pain severity (e.g., moderate vs. no: Relative Risk Ratio [RRR]=0.38, p&lt;0.001), and lower likelihood of receiving pain treatment, i.e., recent use of over-the-counter pain medications (OR=0.60, p=0.02) and opioids (OR=0.33, p&lt;0.001), and regular intake of prescriptions for pain (OR=0.461, p=0.002). CIND was associated with reporting lower pain severity (e.g., moderate vs. no: RRR=0.75, p=0.021), lower likelihood of reporting pain interference (OR=0.79, p=0.045) and recent over-the-counter pain medication use (OR=0.74, p=0.026).

CONCLUSION:

CIND and dementia increased the risk of under-report and under-treatment of pain. Systematic efforts are needed to improve pain recognition and treatment among older adults with cognitive impairment, regardless of dementia diagnosis.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Pain affects over 50% community-dwelling older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD).1 When not appropriately identified and treated, pain can worsen the neuropsychiatric symptoms of ADRD,2–4 hasten cognitive and physical decline,5,6 decrease quality of life,7 result in hospitalizations8 and even death.9 Nevertheless, pain is under-recognized among older adults with ADRD,10 because they are less likely to self-report pain than cognitively intact people,11,12 and clinicians find it difficult to assess pain in this population.13

Pain is under-treated in older adults with ADRD, as in studies that were mostly conducted in the hospital and nursing home settings. Morrison et al. (2000)14 reported that among post-operative patients with hip fracture, patients with advanced ADRD received only 1/3 the amount of morphine sulfate equivalents to that received by patients with intact cognition.14 Studies have shown that patients with cognitive impairment and ADRD were less likely to receive any analgesics,4,15,16 waited over 60 minutes longer to receive analgesics,17–19 received weaker analgesics17–19 and lower dosage of analgesics than peers with intact cognition.16,20 Similar under-recognition and under-treatment of pain have been reported in nursing home residents with cognitive impairment and ADRD,12,21,22 and among memory clinic patients or trial participants with mild cognitive impairment,23,24 suggesting that poor pain recognition may start early in the ADRD spectrum.

Beyond cognitive function,24 pain recognition and management can also be affected by factors such as the individual’s demographic and socioeconomic status (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and insurance9,25,26), medical condition,27 physical6 and mental health status (e.g., depression3), and caregiver support.28

Moreover, substantial differences exist in pain assessment and treatment across care settings. Structured care settings such as hospitals and nursing homes have 24/7 clinical oversight from skilled personnel such as nurses, yet older adults living at home may not have continuous monitoring as such. Further, personnel in structured care settings generally have more training and resources that increase their capabilities of identifying pain in patients with ADRD, as compared to informal caregivers of community-dwelling older adults who are often family members or care companions. Last, structured care settings may have policies and guidelines that prompt for better identification and treatment of pain, e.g., the Joint Commission’s Pain Management Standards.29 These differences indicate that prior evidence on pain in persons with ADRD generated in structured care settings may or may not be generalizable to the community.

Most older Americans with ADRD live in the community,30–32 yet there is a paucity of high-quality, national studies on pain in this population.28 Few studies that examined pain in older adults with ADRD reported important yet mixed findings,28 which are likely due to the different samples used (small local versus national samples in different countries), where the lack of nationally representative evidence in the U.S. in this regard highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how pain is recognized and treated in this population.

In this study, we used a nationally representative sample of Americans ≥ 50 years old to examine 1) the relationship between ADRD and pain assessment, including the reported presence, severity, and interference of pain, and 2) the relationship between ADRD and reported use of pain treatment. We hypothesized that a) older adults with ADRD are less likely to report pain and pain interference, and report lower severity of pain, than those with intact cognition, and 2) among older adults who report pain, those with ADRD are less likely to receive pain treatment.

METHODS

Study Design and Data Source

This study is a secondary analysis of data in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS; conducted by University of Michigan [NIA U01AG009740]). The HRS is an ongoing longitudinal cohort survey with a nationally representative sample of 50+ U.S. community-dwelling adults.33 The HRS investigators utilized multi-stage area probability design (e.g., geographical stratification and oversampling of certain demographic groups33) to generate a sample with over 37,000 participants to fully represent U.S. adults ≥ 50 years old.33 The HRS has been conducted every 2 years since 1992. Data in this study were obtained from the 2018 HRS public survey.34 We did not use the most recent HRS data (2020), because COVID19 might have introduced uncontrollable confounding that could skew the findings. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Rochester (MOD00009269).

Study Sample

From the 2018 HRS dataset (n=17,146), we excluded nursing home residents (n=310) and participants &lt; 50 years old (n=456). The final sample included 16,380 participants.

HRS interviews were conducted by trained research staff with the participant (self-respondent) or a proxy (e.g., spouse), if the respondent is unwilling / unable to participate in the interview independently because of physical / mental limitations. HRS investigators have developed guidelines on determining the need for a proxy and proxy selection.35 In this study, we included both self-respondent HRS participants and those who used proxies to complete the interview.

Dependent Variables

Pain presence (Yes/No):

All HRS participants were asked “Are you often troubled with pain?”, and those reported affirmatively were considered as having pain.

Pain severity (No / Mild / Moderate / Severe):

For HRS participants who reported having pain, pain severity was assessed by asking “How bad is the pain most of the time: mild, moderate, or severe?” Participants not reporting having pain were coded as “No” for pain severity.

Pain interference (Yes/No):

For HRS participants who reported having pain, pain interference was assessed by asking “Does the pain make it difficult for you to do your usual activities such as household chores or work?” Participants not reporting having pain were coded as “No” for pain interference.

Pain treatment (Yes/No):

Pain treatment is assessed in three variables.

Recent reported use of over-the-counter pain medications (e.g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and aspirin) in the past three months (yes/no) was assessed by asking “Over-the-counter pain medications include such things as Advil, Aleve, Tylenol, aspirin or similar medications. In the past three months have you taken any over-the-counter pain medications for the treatment of pain?”

Recent use of opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine and morphine) in the past 3 months (yes/no) was assessed by asking “Another class of pain medications, called “opioids”, includes such things as Vicodin, OxyContin, codeine, morphine, or similar medications. In the past three months, have you taken any opioid pain medications?”

Regular intake of prescriptions for pain (yes/no) was assessed by asking “Do you regularly take prescription medications for any of the following common health problems: Pain in your joints or muscles?” There may be overlapping between regular intake of prescriptions for pain and recent use of over-the-counter analgesics and opioids.

Though many patients with mild and moderate ADRD and relatively reserved cognitive function can still reliably report pain.3,36,37 those with severe ADRD are likely to have significant memory loss that prevent them from reliably self-reporting pain and medication use, thus the need for proxy report. Among prior HRS studies on pain in patients with cognitive impairment, some excluded participants with severe cognitive impairment (TICS score ≤ 8), a dementia diagnosis,38 or used proxy for interviews,39 while some included participants with ADRD.40 We included HRS participants with severe cognitive impairment and those using proxy in this study, because: (1) they represent the most vulnerable subgroup for under-recognition and under-treatment of pain who can potentially benefit the most from findings in this study; (2) proxy report is a valuable data source of pain assessment and treatment among older adults with severe ADRD, as proxies tend to over-report pain in the patients (52%) than the patient him/herself (32%) and rarely missed patients who self-reported pain41; and (3) patients with severe cognitive impairment often rely on caregivers for medication administration.

Independent Variable: ADRD

ADRD was identified using a previously validated method based on self- and proxy-reported cognitive measures in the HRS42.

For self-respondents, cognitive function was assessed with a range of tests adapted from the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICSm). These cognitive tests include an immediate and delayed 10-noun free recall test, a serial 7 subtraction test, and a backward count from 20 test. Based on the total score of cognitive function collected in the TICSm (0–27), cognitive function was categorized as “dementia” (0–6), “cognitive impairment, no dementia (CIND),” (7–11), or “intact cognition” (12–27).

For respondents represented by a proxy, cognitive function was assessed by the proxy’s assessment of the respondent’s memory (score 0–4 from excellent to poor), the proxy’s assessment of the respondent’s limitations in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) based on 5 IADLS (i.e., taking medications, managing money, preparing meals, making phone calls, and shopping for groceries; score 0–5), and the survey interviewer’s assessment of the participant’s difficulty in completing the interview because of cognitive impairment (score 0–2 from “none” to “preventing completion). Total proxy-reported scores were calculated based on these cognitive measures (0–11) and were used to categorize respondents as having “dementia” (6–11), “CIND” (3–5) and “no cognitive impairment” (0–2).

Both approaches, using self-reported cognitive measures and proxy-reported cognitive measures, 42,43 have been validated in prior studies against gold-standard of ADRD assessment and diagnosis (e.g., using comprehensive in-home neuropsychological and clinical assessment and expert clinician adjudication) 44,45. The HRS used a mixed telephone and face-to-face interview modes and prior research has shown that cognitive performance scores in HRS are not affected by whether they are collected over the telephone or face-to-face.43

Covariates

Covariates that are potentially related to pain, ADRD, and pain treatment were controlled, including age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education, employment status, number of co-residing children, insurance coverage, self-rated health status (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor), ADL and IADL limitations, depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression score ≥ 4), specific chronic conditions, number of chronic conditions, and proxy interview.

Statistical Analysis

To test hypothesis 1, we performed logistic regression to examine the relationship of ADRD with pain presence and pain interference, and we performed multinomial logistic regression to examine the relationship between ADRD and pain severity. To test hypothesis 2, in the subsample who reported pain, we conducted logistic regression models to examine the relationship between ADRD and the use of pain medications, using separate models for each of the three variables: over-the-counter analgesic use in the past 3 months (yes/no), opioid use in the past 3 months (yes/no), and regular intake of prescriptions for pain (yes/no). Sensitivity analyses were conducted with self-respondents only. All regression models adjusted for respondent covariates and used HRS sampling weights to adjust for nonresponse and the complex sampling design of the HRS survey. Standard errors of estimates were adjusted using Taylor series linearization.46 Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 15.1 (College Station, TX).

RESULTS

The sample (16,838) had an average age of 67 years, was primarily white, female, married, Medicare beneficiaries, having high school diploma as the highest educational level, retired, lived with 0.4 children, and rated self-health status as “good” or “very good”. On average, each participant had 1.5 chronic conditions with osteoarthritis, diabetes, and heart disease being the most common. Some participants had ADL limitations, IADL limitations, and depressive symptoms (Table 1). The majority of the sample had intact cognition (70.7%), 14.3% had CIND, and 4.5% had dementia. Participants with dementia and CIND were older, less likely to be married, more likely to be racial/ethnic underrepresented groups, retired, Medicare beneficiaries, and have lower educational levels, poorer self-rated health, ADL and IADL limitations, depressive symptoms, more chronic conditions, and to use a proxy (Table 1).

More than forty percent of the sample reported having pain, including 10.8% reporting mild pain, 22.7% moderate pain and 7.9% severe pain. Over one quarter of the sample reported pain interference. Among the participants with pain, 75.6% reported use of over-the-counter pain medications in the past three months, 24.1% reported use of opioids in the past three months, and 47.7% reported regular intake of prescriptions for pain (Table 1).

Compared with intact cognition, adjusted for covariates, dementia was associated with lower likelihood of reporting pain (Odds Ratio [OR]= 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.43, 0.87; p=0.01), reporting lower severity of pain (i.e., moderate pain versus no pain: Relative Risk Ratio [RRR]=0.38, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.62; p&lt;0.001; severe pain versus no pain: RRR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.34, 1.026; p=0.06), and lower likelihood of reporting pain interference (OR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.70; p&lt;0.001). As compared with intact cognition, CIND was associated with lower odds of reporting pain (OR= 0.86, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.04; p=0.12), reporting lower severity of pain (i.e., moderate pain versus no pain: RRR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.96; p=0.02) and lower likelihood of reporting pain interference (OR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.99; p&lt;0.05), as shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S1–S3.

Among participants reporting pain (n=6,812), compared with intact cognition, dementia was related to lower likelihood of reporting over-the-counter pain medication use (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.91, p=0.02), opioid use (OR=0.33; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.55; p&lt;0.001) in the past three months, and regular intake of prescriptions for pain (OR=0.46, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.75; p=0.002). CIND was associated with lower likelihood of reporting use of over-the-counter pain medications in the past three months (OR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.96, p=0.03), but there was no clear trend in the association between CIND and the likelihood of reporting opioid use in the past three months (OR=0.86, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.18, p=0.34), and between CIND and the likelihood of regular intake of prescription medications for pain (OR=0.95, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.18, p=0.63), as shown in Table 3 and Supplementary Tables S4–S6. Effect sizes (OR and RRR) of the impact of cognitive impairment on reporting of pain and pain treatment were larger for dementia than for CIND (Figure 1). Sensitivity analyses with only self-respondents (15,870 out of 16,838) showed consistent results (Supplementary Tables S7–S12).

DISCUSSION

This study used nationally representative data of older Americans 50 years and older to examine the associations between cognitive impairment in the ADRD spectrum and the report of pain and pain treatment, with two principal findings. First, both CIND and dementia were associated with lower likelihood of reporting pain and reported lower severity and less interference of pain. Second, among those reporting pain, CIND and dementia were associated with lower likelihood of reporting analgesic use, including use of over-the-counter analgesics and opioids in the past 3 months and regular intake of prescriptions for pain.

Findings in this study corroborate results of two prior studies that reported the prevalence, correlates, and interference of pain in U.S. community-dwelling older adults using national datasets (2011 NHATS data of Medicare beneficiaries10 and 2017 NHIS data of U.S. adults25). The current study also examined the reported use of pain treatment in this population. The finding that older Americans with dementia and CIND, when having pain, are less likely to report use of pain medications is significant and aligned with prior evidence on under-treatment of pain among older persons within the ADRD spectrum.4,8,10,14,20,47

Further, it is noticeable that the effects of cognitive impairment on pain treatment started early in the ADRD spectrum and increased as the severity of ADRD increased from CIND to dementia, suggesting a positive relationship between ADRD severity and under-treatment of pain that may be the result of multiple contributors. First, significant cognitive impairment associated with ADRD may limit the person’s ability to report pain and changes in pain symptoms after using analgesics, potentially leading to delayed treatment and under-treatment of pain. Second, certain behavioral expressions of pain, such as agitation, grimacing, and unusual verbal expressions may be confused with behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of ADRD and lead to under-treatment of pain.4 Third, the ability to self-manage pain using over-the-counter medications or devices (e.g., pain patches) is also limited for patients with severe cognitive impairment because they may no longer drive, shop, and manage money. Last, guidelines for pain detection and management for older persons with ADRD are mostly generated for structured care settings with limited guidance for those in the community.27,48 Pain identification in the community is often dependent on informal caregivers, who may and may not have adequate training to identify pain and advocate for pain treatment for patients with ADRD.41,49,50

The finding that CIND and dementia were related to lower likelihoods of reported opioid use may not indicate under-treatment of pain, but clinician stewardship for safe opioid prescribing in older persons with ADRD. This is because even though opioids may be appropriate for managing short-term post-surgical and breakthrough pain and for improving the quality of life of end-of-life patients,51 opioids have greater side effects than non-opioid pain medications, such as delirium and falls that are more prone for those with ADRD,52 and thus more caution of the clinicians in prescribing opioids for those in the ADRD spectrum.

The finding that older Americans with ADRD and CIND are less likely to report pain is consistent with prior studies conducted in structured care settings.4,8,17 The higher unadjusted rates of presence, severity and interference of pain among persons with ADRD than those with intact cognition are also consistent with previous reports using nationally representative in the U.S.10,25 These findings may be interpreted in the context of the positive association between ADRD and the etiology of pain, as persons with ADRD are more likely to have comorbidities (e.g., arthritis, diabetes, and heart disease) than those without ADRD that can give rise to pain.1,53 Adjusted for covariates including comorbidities, the independent associations between ADRD and lower odds of reporting pain, pain severity and pain interference are likely due to the limited ability to report pain among persons with significant cognitive impairment, particularly in cognitive function and mental state.11,12

Cognitive impairment within the ADRD spectrum is associated with deterioration in memory, language, and speech54,55 which can make recall and communication of pain experience challenging. Similarly, retrospective self-report of pain (i.e., in the past few days) may be limited due to progressive declines in short-term memory56 and distortions in perceptions of time,56 leading to a loss of valuable information regarding the presence and the variability of the pain experience. The impaired awareness that is characteristic of ADRD57 can further interfere with the patient’s ability to accurately recognize, identify, and describe pain. The finding that those with CIND were just as likely to report pain as those with no cognitive impairment, but still reported lower pain severity and less pain interference is interesting and may suggest an earlier decrease in awareness. Emerging evidence suggests that awareness begins to decline during the early stages of cognitive impairment prior to a dementia diagnosis, and continues as the cognitive impairment progresses to dementia.58 This suggests that individuals with CIND represent a group at risk for underreporting of their pain experience.

Pain affects one’s mental health,3 physical functioning,6 sleep,59 and ability to perform daily activities,60 thus having profound impacts on quality of life.7,61 Different from patients in hospitals or nursing homes whose pain can be monitored by clinicians around-the-clock, older adults with ADRD in the community often rely on family and other informal caregivers to identify and treat their pain.62 This potential dependence of pain assessment and treatment on the care setting28 highlights the need for more support for informal caregivers to recognize pain of community-living older adults with ADRD, such as combining self-report with observation (e.g., different walking pace, unusual postures, verbal and facial expression). Our findings in pain reporting among those with CIND suggest that pain assessment should account for the presence of cognitive impairment, regardless of a current diagnosis of dementia. Older persons in the community should receive routine pain assessment and have easy access to medications and non-pharmacological pain treatment, such as hot/cold patches and pain pads.

This study has several limitations. First, the HRS does not include information about the diagnosis or severity of ADRD. However, the method of identifying patients with dementia and CIND in HRS has robust reliability and validity.42,43 Second, we used cross-sectional HRS data and could not ascertain causality in the observed relationships between ADRD and pain assessment and treatment. We also did not know how long the participant had been having pain, though most previous studies using HRS data considered a response of “yes” to the question of “Are you often troubled by pain” a valid indicator of chronic pain.26,39,63–67 There is a chance of under-reporting pain among patients with severe cognitive impairment, where observation-based measurement of pain is recommended (e.g., PAINAD). Nevertheless, the overall rate of 41.6% of having frequent pain in this study is comparable to previously reported prevalence rates of pain among community-dwelling older adults (20–46%68). The HRS questions about recent and regular analgesic use provide an overall understanding of pain treatment, as in previous studies.69,70 To precisely measure pain and its treatment longitudinally, the ecological momentary assessment - a preferable approach to measure behavior changes over time71 - can be used to minimize recall bias among individuals with ADRD.

CONCLUSION

In a nationally representative sample of older Americans, dementia and CIND are associated with lower likelihoods of reporting pain, pain interference and lower pain severity, and, when pain is reported, a lower likelihood of pain treatment. Findings underscore the need for systematic community-based efforts to improve the recognition and treatment of pain among older adults within the ADRD spectrum.

Key Message

In a nationally representative sample of Americans ≥ 50 years, both milder and more severe cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are associated with lower likelihood of reporting pain and receiving pain treatment, indicating risk of under-reported and under-treated pain among older adults within the ADRD spectrum.
