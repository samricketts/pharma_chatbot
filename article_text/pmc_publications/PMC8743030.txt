Novel therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are of the greatest priority given the consistent failure of recent clinical trials focused on Aβ or pTau. Earlier, we demonstrated that mild mitochondrial complex I inhibitor CP2 blocks neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in multiple mouse models of AD. To evaluate the safety of CP2 in humans, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 196 lymphoblastoid cell lines and identified 11 SNP loci and 64 mRNA expression probe sets that potentially associate with CP2 susceptibility. Using primary mouse neurons and pharmacokinetic study, we show that CP2 is generally safe at a therapeutic dose.

pmc1. Introduction

Increased longevity over the last few decades contributed to the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders of aging, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in particular. AD is a multifactorial disorder affecting more than 36 million people worldwide, with expectations to rise to 115 million people by 2050 (Tan et al., 2014). It is the sixth leading cause of death in the USA, with a new case diagnosed every 68 seconds (Alzheimer’s.Association, 2012). Despite significant efforts, AD has no cure. Few approved drugs are not disease modifying and provide only symptomatic relief in a subset of patients. AD is characterized by progressive accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (pTau), energy hypometabolism, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction that ultimately result in memory decline and neurodegeneration. The consistent failure of clinical trials focused on reducing pTau, and Aβ levels and aggregation suggests that such therapies may not work in AD patients regardless of the disease stage, underscoring the need to discover novel therapeutic targets (Cummings et al., 2014; Mullard, 2020; Panza et al., 2019).

One of the earliest dysfunctions prominent in patients with mild cognitive impairment, a prodromal stage of AD, is brain hypometabolism, where the reduction of glucose uptake in the brain is detected using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Mosconi et al., 2010). Glucose is the major source of energy in neurons that is produced by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Murphy and Hartley, 2018). The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery in mitochondria consists of four complexes that ensure transfer of electrons through the mitochondrial membrane to empower complex V to generate ATP (Flannery and Trushina, 2019a). Reduced availability of glucose results in the activation of compensatory mechanisms to ensure sustained energy production in the brain that could be devastating for the organism, with females being the most susceptible to the toll of utilizing the axillary fuel (Arnold et al., 2020; Cunnane et al., 2020; Klosinski et al., 2015). The recognition of the abnormal energy homeostasis as the underlying mechanism of early AD implies that strategies focused on energy restitution in the brain could be beneficial with mitochondria posing as an important drug target (Cunnane et al., 2020; Flannery and Trushina, 2019b; Murphy and Hartley, 2018).

Mitochondria are unique organelles that are the only ones apart from the nucleus with their own DNA (mtDNA). They are also very dynamic, especially in neurons, moving within the cell to the sites of energy demand. They have their life cycle where new mitochondria are produced by a process known as biogenesis, and old organelles are removed by an autophagic process known as mitophagy (Flannery and Trushina, 2019a). Mitochondria respond to environmental changes and energy demands of the cell by rapidly changing their shape, fusing together to form an interconnected reticulum, and by dividing to either increase mitochondrial number or to segregate portions of the organelle for degradation via mitophagy (Labbe et al., 2014; Mishra and Chan, 2014, 2016; Trushina, 2016). Moreover, recent data implicate mitochondria in various cell signaling pathways where metabolites associated with OXPHOS, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as important signaling molecules (Chandel, 2015). This versatility allows mitochondria to orchestrate an adaptive stress response in respect to the environmental changes communicating with other subcellular organelles, including the nucleus, that induces changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications ensuring sustained energy availability and cell survival (Boos et al., 2019; Eisenberg-Bord and Schuldiner, 2017; Wiese and Bannister, 2020). Remarkably, the adaptive stress response stimulated by exercise or caloric restriction, non-pharmacological strategies that affect energy levels, were shown to be beneficial in healthy humans and individuals with multiple diseases including AD (Flannery and Trushina, 2019b; Mercken et al., 2012; Rosenberg et al., 2020). The outcomes of these interventions included a reduction of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, improved proteostasis, cognitive function, and strengthened neuronal networks and plasticity (Redman et al., 2018; Stranahan and Mattson, 2012). Molecular mechanisms of mitochondria-mediated stress response mainly converge on the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis (Hardie et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2017). AMPK activation has been shown to engage multiple downstream pathways including mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, enhanced proteostasis (e.g., the removal of aggregated Aβ and pTau proteins), improved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response, ultimately leading to enhanced energy homeostasis, mitochondrial and cognitive function, and neuroprotection (Caberlotto et al., 2013; Gabuzda et al., 1994; Marinangeli et al., 2018).

However, the development of direct pharmacological AMPK activators has been faced with substantial challenges (Steinberg and Carling, 2019). Indirect AMPK activation in response to energetic stress associated with energy fluctuations during caloric restriction or exercise appears to be the safest and most beneficial. Unexpectedly, activation of AMPK via partial reduction of the activity of individual OXPHOS complexes, mitochondrial complex I (MCI) in particular, using genetic or pharmacological manipulations, provided significant health benefits, prevented obesity and type II diabetes (Pospisilik et al., 2007; Quintens et al., 2013; Vernochet et al., 2012; Wredenberg et al., 2006), improved mitochondrial function and cellular energetics, and promoted longevity in model organisms and humans (Baumgart et al., 2016; Copeland et al., 2009; Dillin et al., 2002; Feng et al., 2001; Hamilton et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2005; Miyadera et al., 2001; Raule et al., 2014). Recently, MCI was identified as a hub for negative correlation with lifespan where its mild inhibition with small molecule rotenone prolonged lifespan and rejuvenated the transcriptome in N. furzeri, an African turquoise killifish (Baumgart et al., 2016). The authors linked the effect of rotenone to life-extending interventions via a transient burst of ROS that induced adaptive stress responses (Ristow, 2014). Likewise, life-extending effects of metformin in mice (Martin-Montalvo and de Cabo, 2013) and in C. elegans (De Haes et al., 2014) may be mediated by mild suppression of mitochondrial activity, since, among other targets, metformin inhibits MCI (Tsigelny et al., 2014).

We recently identified a small molecule tricyclic pyrone compound (code name CP2) as a mild MCI inhibitor that competes with the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) for binding to MCI (Zhang et al., 2015). Chronic treatment in independent cohorts of transgenic mice that harbor mutations in genes that predispose humans to develop AD (familial AD mutations) demonstrated a significant block of neurodegeneration and restoration of cognitive function even when treatment was administered after the development of neurodegeneration, Aβ and pTau accumulation, and cognitive dysfunction (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019). Application of translational biomarkers FDG-PET, 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) spectroscopy and metabolomics revealed that this treatment restores glucose uptake and utilization in the brain, improves energy homeostasis leading to increased synaptic activity, long term potentiation and cognitive function (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021). Mechanistic studies demonstrated that in neurons, CP2 activated AMPK-dependent neuroprotective mechanisms including autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015) Cross-validation of the transcriptomic changes in the brain tissue of CP2-treated AD mice and patients with AD using data available at Accelerating Medicines Partnership in Alzheimer’s Disease Target Discovery and Preclinical Validation Project (AMP-AD – ampadportal.org) (Logsdon et al., 2019) demonstrated a significant reversal of key mechanisms that contribute to the disease in humans (Stojakovic et al., 2021). Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that targeting MCI may present a new therapeutic approach with high translational potential to restore energy homeostasis and block neurodegeneration in AD.

While our preclinical studies demonstrated exceptional safety of chronic administration of CP2 to mice over prolonged (up to 20 months) period of time starting in utero (Zhang et al., 2015), at pre-symptomatic (Zhang et al., 2015) or symptomatic stages of the disease (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021), safety margins in respect to humans have not been investigated. Given the ongoing development of novel small molecules specific MCI inhibitors for treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (Trushina et al., 2019), it is important to address whether changes in genetic makeup associated with differential gene expression in respect to metabolic pathways and mitochondrial function could preclude from the safe application of this strategy in humans.

The objective of this investigation was to utilize the power of the genome-wide association analyses and the availability of a panel of well-characterized and ethnically diversified human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) (Niu and Wang, 2015) to determine the safety of the CP2 application. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have emerged as a powerful tool to identify associations with adverse drug effects (Wang and Weinshilboum, 2008), even when the biological mechanisms are complex, as in the case of MCI inhibitors. The LCL cell panel employed in this study was previously extensively characterized using multi-omics approaches providing information that includes 1.3 million genotyped genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 54,613 mRNA expression probe sets, and has been employed to study the sensitivity of two dozen drugs, including another MCI inhibitor metformin (Niu et al., 2016; Niu and Wang, 2015). Our results provide strong support for the safe application of MCI inhibitors in a diverse human population at doses shown efficacious in preclinical translational studies.

1. Material and methods

2.1. CP2 synthesis

CP2 was synthesized by the Nanosyn, Inc biotech company (http://www.nanosyn.com) as described in (Hua et al., 2003) and purified using HPLC. Authentication was done through NMR spectra to ensure the lack of batch-to-batch variation in purity. CP2 was synthesized as free base. For in vitro experiments, CP2 was prepared as 50 mM stock solution in DMSO. Stock aliquots of 20 μl were stored at −80 °C. Each aliquot was used once to avoid the freeze-though cycle.

2.2. EBV-transformed LCLs

As described previously (Ingle et al., 2010; Niu et al., 2016), EBV-transformed LCLs were purchased from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ), and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Manassas, VA) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning). A subpanel of 36 African American (AA) (3 males, 33 females), 84 Caucasian American (CA) (41 males, 43 females), and 76 Han Chinese American (HCA) (39 males, 37 females) unrelated subjects (sample sets HD100AA, HD100CAU, HD100CHI) were used for CP2 cytotoxicity screening. The age ranged from 5 to 75 for the CA group, 15 to 49 for the AA group, and for the HCA group, the age of the donors was not available. These samples had been anonymized by NIGMS, and all subjects had provided written consent for their experimental use.

2.3. CP2 cytotoxicity assay in LCLs and primary neurons

CP2 was dissolved in DMSO as stock solution before further diluted before conducting the experiments. 50,000 LCL cells or 55,000 primary cortical neurons were seeded into 96-well plates and treated with a final concentration of 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200 μM CP2 or solvent for 72 h. Cell viability was assessed using MTT reagent (Cat # G4000, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viability data for each cell line was normalized to its solvent treatment, respectively. The IC50 was calculated using the log-sigmoid function with fixed maximum and minimum and variable slope using Graphpad Prism. A two-way ANOVA was used to test differences of log10(IC50) among groups stratified by race and sex (for LCLs), and p-value ≤0.05 was considered significant. Experiments were conducted in three biological replicates. For neuronal cultures, experiments were repeated in triplicates in three biological replicates.

2.4. Expression array assay in LCLs

The LCLs expression data was acquired from Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 54k expression array (mapped to 21928 genes) as described in our previous studies (Li et al., 2008; Niu et al., 2016; Niu et al., 2010). This data is publicly available from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under SuperSeries accession no. GSE24277.

2.5. Genome-wide SNPs genotyping in LCLs

As described previously (Niu et al., 2010), LCL genotypes by Illumina HumanHap 550K and 510S BeadArrays, and Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 are publicly available from NCBI GEO under accession No. GSE24277. SNPs that are significant at p-values ≤ 0.001 for exact test for Hardy- Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), call rates &lt; 95%, or minor allele frequencies (MAFs) &lt; 5% were removed from the analysis, resulting in total of 1184972 SNPs entering our GWAS analysis.

2.6. Primary mouse cortical neuronal cultures

All experiments with mice were approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee per the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. IACUC Protocol A00001186–16-R18. Primary cortical neurons were cultured as described in (Trushina et al., 2012). Briefly, female pregnant mice were anesthetized with isoflurane on gestational day 17, and fetuses were rapidly removed. Fetal brains were extracted and placed in sterile HEPES buffered saline (HBS) (pH 7.3). The cortices were dissected from each embryo and combined. Tissue was placed in 1 mg/mL papain (Warthington, NJ) in HBS for 20 min at 37 °C. After two washes in HBS, the dissociated tissue was triturated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% Ham’s F12 with glutamine (Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, NY), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories Logan, UT) and 1x pen/strep antibiotic mixture. Cells were counted, diluted to 5.5×105 cells/mL, and 100 μL of this stock was placed in each well of a 96-well dish for cytotoxicity experiment. All plates were coated with poly-L-ornithine (1 mg/2 mL sterile borate buffer, pH 8.4). Plated cells were maintained in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After 72 h in culture, the serum-containing medium was replaced with a serum-free Neurobasal-based medium (with glutamine, Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, NY) containing 1 x pen/strep antibiotic mixture and 1 x B27 supplement (Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, NY). Neurons were fed on day 6. All experiments were performed in neurons 7 days in culture.

2.7. In vivo CP2 Pharmacokinetics

CP2 bioavailability was determined using C57BL/6J female mice ordered from the Jackson Laboratory. An independent cohort of mice was administered CP2 by oral gavage (25 mg/kg in 20% PEG 400 and 5% dextrose water in PEG) with a 1 cc tuberculin syringe with a stainless steel 22 gauge straight feeding needle. At 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after treatment, mice were anesthetized, the brain was removed, immediately frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C until the analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters for CP2 were estimated with standard non-compartmental analysis.

2.8. CP2 quantification using LC-MS/MS

Paclitaxel (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was used as an internal standard (IS). Ultra-pure water was generated using a Barnstead nanopure diamond system (Thermo, Marietta, OH). Optima LC/MS-grade methanol (MeOH, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), analytical grade formic acid (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 96 well protein crash plates, and 1 ml 96 well polypropylene collection plates (Chromtech, Apple Valley, MN), Kunststoff-Kapillaren end-to-end K2EDTA coated plastic 30 μl capillary tubes (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and K2EDTA presprayedmicrotainer collection tubes (500 μl, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were utilized in this study. For controls, drug-free mouse plasma was obtained from healthy CD-1 mice containing 0.1% K2EDTA purchased from Valley Biomedical and stored at −20 °C for later use. The LC-MS/MS consisted of a Waters Acquity H class ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system containing a quaternary solvent manager and sample manager-FTN coupled to a Xevo TQ-S mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Data were acquired and analyzed using Waters MassLynx v4.1 software. Detection of CP2 and paclitaxel (internal standard, IS) was accomplished by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using the mass spectrometer in positive ESI mode with capillary voltage, 2.5 kV; source temperature 150 °C; desolvation temperature 400 °C; cone gas flow 150 L/h; desolvation gas flow 800 L/h. The cone voltages and collision energies for CP2 and paclitaxel were determined by MassLynx-Intellistart v4.1 software and were 12 and 18 V (cone) and 30 and 66 eV (collision), respectively. MRM precursor and productions were monitored at m/z 394.41 &gt; 139.19 for CP2 and 854.29 &gt; 105.08 for paclitaxel. Data were collected from 2 – 5.5 for both CP2 and paclitaxel. The separation of CP2 and paclitaxel was achieved using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (2.7 μ, 2.1 × 100 mm) with an Agilent EC-C18 pre-column (2.7 μ, 2.1 × 5 mm) and a gradient elution program containing ultra-pure water and MeOH, both with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient begins with 70% aqueous, decreases to 10% aqueous over 3 min, and holds there for 2 min, then returns to baseline over 0.1 min and holds to equilibrate for 2.9 min. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, the total run time was 8 min, injection volume was 5 μl, and the column and autosampler temperatures were 40°C and 20°C, respectively. Stock solutions of CP2 (5 mg/mL, dissolved in DMSO) and paclitaxel (200 ng/mL, dissolved in acetonitrile, ACN) were prepared in salinized glass vials and stored at −20°C. 20X working stock solutions were prepared daily and diluted in 1:1 MeOH:H2O and stored at −20°C. Plasma standards containing CP2 (0.2 – 100 ng/mL) were prepared by adding (5 μl) aliquots of 20 X CP2 to plasma (95 μl) in 1.5 mL slick microfuge tubes, 50 μl of this plasma dilution were transferred to a 96 well protein crash plate. Analytes were isolated using protein precipitation with 150 μl ACN containing IS (200 ng/ml). The plate was capped and shaken for 20 min at 1100 rpm. The sample was then vacuum filtered into a Chromtech (Apple Valley, MN) 1 mL 96 well polypropylene collection plate, evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and reconstituted with 200 μl H2O/ACN (1:1). The collection plate was capped and shaken at 900 rpm for 20 min, and 5 μl aliquots were injected into the LC/MS/MS. Mass Spectra and ion chromatograms of CP2 and IS were processed using MassLynx v4.1 software with TargetLynx. Standard curves for CP2 and paclitaxel were analyzed using the peak area ratio of CP2 vs. IS. CP2 standard curve concentrations were 0.2, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ng/ml. The concentration of CP2 in the brain was determined using the same approach.

2.9. Statistical methods

As we described previously (Niu et al., 2010; Price et al., 2006), the population stratification was assessed and adjusted by calculating the first two eigenvectors for each race group, and the genotypes and log10(IC50) of each individual were adjusted to each race. The individual genotypes were adjusted using regression model Gij = αj + ∑γkj+ εij, where, with Gij is the genotype for the ith cell line in the jth race group j (j = AA, CA, HCA), αj is the race effect for race j, γkj is the kth eigenvector (k = 1, 2) effect for race j, and ε is the residual after stratification adjustment. Pearson correlation was then performed between log10(IC50) and population stratification adjusted genotype data. T-test on the correlation coefficient was performed and p-value ≤1 × 10−5 was considered suggestively significant. Significant SNPs were annotated with HaploReg v4.1 (https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php). Locus zoom was generated by locally SNP ±400 kb using hg19/1000 genome Nov 2014 EUR as LD reference. (http://locuszoom.org/). Cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) analysis was performed using SNPs genotype and expression of genes located within 200 kb range using the linear model from MatrixEQTL package using R software (r-project.org) for each race group both separately and collectively. Expression data was adjusted for the first two eigenvectors of each race group, in addition to the race, sex, and batch effects. T-test on the Pearson correlation coefficient was performed, and p-value ≤1 × 10−3 was considered significant. All genes with p-value ≤ 1×10−3 were subjected to pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen, Inc.). Networks were built using the IPA network tool after removing molecules redundantly connecting the same groups of other nodes. Pathway enrichment was done using the Overlap – Disease and Functions tool in the IPA.

3. Results

3. 1. Study design

In order to establish whether CP2 administration could be safe in humans and identify potential safety susceptible genetic variations, we utilized a panel of 196 LCLs with previously published genotype and expression data (Niu et al., 2016; Niu and Wang, 2015). These cell lines included 36 individuals from African American (AA), 84 Caucasian American (CA), and 76 Han Chinese American (HCA) background (sample sets HD100AA, HD100CAU, HD100CHI, respectively) with males and females present in each group (Fig. 1A,B). The workflow implemented in the study is presented in Fig. 1A. Each of the 196 LCLs was treated with CP2 in the range of 0.1 – 200 μM, and half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) informative of cellular toxicity were obtained for each LCL. A genome-wide association study (GWAS, Fig. 1A, left arm) was performed by computing correlation between IC50 values and genotypes of 1.3 million SNPs. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis was performed on SNPs and genes located nearby to identify whether gene expression changes were associated with the genotype and treatment outcomes. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS, Fig. 1A, right arm) was performed by computing correlation between IC50 values and 54k mRNA expression probes. Genes whose expression was significantly associated with the IC50 values were subjected to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).

3.2. The association between sex, race and CP2 treatment in human LCLs

We found that the overall IC50 values for CP2 treatment in all LCLs regardless of sex and race were in the range of 5.6 – 125.2 μM with the overall mean ± SD of 33.64 ± 25.32 μM for all cells combined (Fig. 1B). We next evaluated whether race or sex had an association with CP2 treatment. Due to the intrinsically logarithmic nature of the IC50 values, we performed the test using log10 transformed IC50 values for the analysis. The log10(IC50) values follow normal distribution except for the highest quantiles where the IC50 values are approaching maximum tested dosage (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A,B). Because of the unequal representation of males and females in each of the race groups, the analysis was done combining males and females from all three race groups together, using a two-way ANOVA with race and sex as two factors (Fig. 1B,C). We did not find a significant relationship between log10(IC50) and sex, while race appeared to significantly contribute to CP2 treatment (p-value = 0.011) (Fig. 1B,C). While no significant differences were found between AA and CA groups with the average IC50 37.3 ± 25.1 μM and 36.0 ± 26.1 μM, respectively, subjects in the HCA group appeared to be more sensitive to the treatment (average IC50 29.3 ± 24.2 μM) (Fig. 1B,C).

3.3. A GWAS analysis of CP2 treatment in LCLs

SNPs are germline genetic variations that could contribute to drug sensitivity. Depending on the location and organ/tissue specificity, SNPs may result in variation in the amino acid sequence of protein product or variation in expression of nearby genes, a phenomenon known as the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (Saba et al., 2008). We conducted the GWAS using 1.3 million SNPs previously established for these LCLs (Niu et al., 2016; Niu and Wang, 2015) and the CP2 log10(IC50) values to identify specific SNPs that might have significantly contributed to the variation in CP2 treatment susceptibility indicative of potential safety concerns for patients that could carry these particular SNPs. The Manhattan plot of this analysis is shown in Fig. 2A, and the qq-plot for GWAS is shown in Supplementary Material, Fig. S2A. At a threshold of p-value ≤ 1 × 10−5, we identified 13 SNPs within 11 loci associated with CP2 treatment (Fig. 2A, Table 1). We found two loci on chromosome 19 (Fig. 2B) and chromosome 12 (Fig. 2D) of particular interest as they host genes related to drug metabolism and oxidative stress response, mechanisms of significance given the origin of the target.

The most significant SNP associated with CP2 log10(IC50) was the rs7259265 on chromosome 19 (p-value = 3.52 × 10−7) (Fig. 2A,B). This SNP is located in a dense coding locus with more than 20 nearby genes, including 5 members of cytochrome P450 enzymes, all belonging to CYP2 family (CYP2A6, CYP2A7, CYP2B6, CYP2B7P, and CYP2G1P). We found that the A allele of the SNP rs7259265 was positively correlated with CP2 log10(IC50) (r = 0.358). The population with the AA genotype appeared to be more resistant to high CP2 doses compared to other genotypes (IC50CC = 26.6 ± 19.0 μM, IC50CA = 43.2 ± 29.7 μM, and IC50AA = 42.0 ± 30.0 μM). This is consistent because the CYP2 family genes encode multiple enzymes that catalyze reactions involved in drug metabolism (Bibi, 2008). However, the SNP rs7259265 is not located in the coding region of any particular gene. Therefore, we evaluated whether it could affect the expression levels of the nearby genes by performing the eQTL analysis. We found that the population with the A allele of the SNP rs7259265 is associated with a lower CYP2A6 expression in the AA group (p-valuelinear = 0.040). In addition, the expression of another gene, SPTBN4, located 83 kb upstream of the SNP rs7259265, was negatively associated with the A allele in the entire population (p-valuelinear = 0.018) as well as in the CA racial subgroup (p-valuelinear = 0.022) (Fig. 2C). The SPTBN4 gene encodes spectrin protein, an actin crosslinking and molecular scaffold protein that links the cell membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, and functions in determining of cell shape, the arrangement of transmembrane proteins, and organization of organelles (Berghs et al., 2000). It is enriched in the brain, and alterations in its expression or mutations have been associated with neurodegenerative disorders (Hausler et al., 2020; Knierim et al., 2017). Individuals with the SNP rs7259265 in CC or CA groups have higher expression of SPTBN4 and CYP2A6 and were more sensitive to CP2 treatment.

Another locus among the top signals was the SNP rs7976582 (p-value &lt; 3.91×10−6), which is located on chromosome 12 (Fig. 2A,D). This SNP is located between TXNRD1 (104 kb upstream) and CHST11 (2.5 kb downstream) genes that are involved in redox signaling and antioxidant response (Fig. 2D). The A allele of this SNP was positively correlated with log10(IC50) (r = 0.323). The population with AA genotype was more tolerant of high CP2 doses compared to other genotypes (IC50 with GG, GA and AA = 25.2 ± 17.1 μM, 38.7 ± 28.1 μM, and 48.3 ± 30.8 μM, respectively). The eQTL analysis indicated that A allele of the rs7976582 was significantly correlated with lower expression of CHST11 (p-valuelinear = 0.012) in the whole population, but higher expression of TXNRD1 (p-valuelinear = 0.011) in the HCA group, specifically (Fig. 2E). The TXNRD1 gene encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme thioredoxin reductase 1, conserved throughout all living organisms, and plays a key role in protecting against oxidative stress (Dato et al., 2015). Splice variants of this gene also enhance transcriptional activities of estrogen receptors (Damdimopoulos et al., 2004). On the other hand, CHST11 catalyzes the transfer of sulfate in the biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate, which is implicated in inducing the antioxidant enzyme hemoxygenase-1 (Egea et al., 2010). The population with GG allele that express less TXNRD1 and higher CHST11 are more sensitive to CP2 treatment. While our preclinical data indicate that chronic CP2 treatment resulted in increased resistance to oxidative stress (Zhang et al., 2015) and a reduction of lipid peroxidation (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021) these data are supportive of the fact that at high concentrations MCI inhibitors could increase the production of ROS by mitochondria. Thus, the augmented expression of antioxidant genes and their protein products could help to mitigate these effects.

3.4. A TWAS analysis of CP2 treatment in LCLs

A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) reveals drug sensitivity as a result of alterations in gene expression. To identify genes whose expression is associated with the safety of CP2 treatment, we performed the TWAS using 54k mRNA expression probe sets and CP2 log10(IC50) generated in 196 LCLs (Fig. 1A, 3). The most significant signals identified in the association analysis are labeled in the Manhattan plot in Fig. 3A, and qq-plot of TWAS is shown in Supplementary Material, Fig. S2B. The association analysis identified 8 genes significantly correlated with CP2 log10(IC50) with p-values &lt; 1 × 10−4, and additional 56 genes with p-values &lt; 1 × 10−3 (Supplementary Material, Table S1). Among eight genes found most significantly associated with CP2 treatment were the ones implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (SFXN5) (Lockhart et al., 2002), ciliary dyskinesia (GAS8) (Olbrich et al., 2015), epilepsy (ICK) (Bailey et al., 2018), and Mental Retardation (Tarpey et al., 2004).

We next determined whether the identified genes were enriched in specific pathways, informing on the mechanisms critical for CP2 efficacy. The IPA constructed two networks based on 64 genes identified in the TWAS (p-value &lt; 1 × 10−3) (Fig. 3B), including 12 genes positively associated with log10IC50 and 8 genes negatively associated with log10IC50. Network 1 included 9 genes related to neuron and nervous system development or neurological diseases (p-value = 2.61 × 10−8), nervous system morphology (p-value = 2.68 ×10−8), and formation of the brain (p-value = 3.62 × 10−7). Network 2 included genes related to the nervous system neoplasm (p-value = 3.53 × 10−5), congenital neurological disorder (p-value = 6.91 ×10−5), and the morphology of the nervous system (p-value = 3.84 × 10−4). The expression of five genes related to the morphology of the nervous system or formation of the brain (GAS8, NPC1, DLG3, DLC1, SYNE2) were negatively correlated with CP2 IC50 values, indicating that higher expression of these genes led to increased susceptibility of LCLs to CP2 treatment. Additionally, seven genes enriched in both cell movement/migration pathways and neuron development and neurological diseases included MTSS1, THBS4, DLC1, NPC1, GAS8, ITSN1, and SYNE2 (Fig. 3B). These genes and their protein products are involved in major cellular functions. For example, a protein encoded by DLG1, a member of the DLG3 family, inhibits myelination (Cotter et al., 2010). Similarly, the DLC1 gene product plays a critical role in the cytoskeletal organization affecting cell proliferation and migration (Goodison et al., 2005). The NPC1 gene encodes a large Niemann-Pick C1 protein essential for the regulation of cholesterol efflux from lysosomes (Carstea et al., 1997). The SYNE2 gene encodes Nesprin-2 protein, which binds to cytoplasmic F-actin, tethering the nucleus to the cytoskeleton and maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleus. The Nesprin-2 protein also interacts with α-catenin and regulates Wnt signaling at the nuclear envelope (Cartwright and Karakesisoglou, 2014). Mutations in NPC1 and SYNE2 genes that affect their function and concentrations are associated with multiple human diseases (Cartwright and Karakesisoglou, 2014; Patterson, 1993).

The expression of two genes (THBS4 and MTSS1) related to the development of neurons (Girard et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016) was positively correlated with the CP2 IC50 values, indicative of a better tolerance of CP2 treatment when highly expressed. The thrombospondin-4 (Thbs4) protein, a product of THBS4 gene, apart from participating in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including cell proliferation and migration, has been found to be involved in early postnatal and adult mouse neurogenesis (Girard et al., 2014). The metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) is an actin- and membrane-binding protein with tumor suppressor functions, which was recently also found to play a role in regulating neuronal morphology affecting dendritic and axonal growth (Yu et al., 2016). Additionally, cell movement (p-value = 5.94 × 10−9) and cell migration (p-values = 9.79 × 10−7), processes related to neurite development (Yu et al., 2016) and neuronal migration (Girard et al., 2014), were also enriched in the pathway analysis.

Interestingly, only few genes related to mitochondria function were associated with CP2 IC50 values (Supplementary Material, Table S1). These include CISD3 gene coding a member of the CDGSH domain-containing family, which may play a role in regulating electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation (Wiley et al., 2007); CYB5RL coding an NADH-cytochrome B5 reductase that is involved in desaturation and elongation of fatty acids, cholesterol biosynthesis, drug metabolism, and, in erythrocyte, methemoglobin reduction (Gaudet et al., 2011); and COX2 coding a Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2. It is one of the three mtDNA encoded subunits of respiratory complex IV. COX-2 is an enzyme that mainly associates with responses to biological stresses such as infection and inflammation (Liu et al., 2015).

3.5. CP2 IC50 values in primary neurons and the in vivo pharmacokinetic

Since CP2 treatment was shown to block neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in multiple mouse models of AD, we next determined the CP2 IC50 in primary cortical neurons cultured from embryonic (E17) wild type mice (Fig. 4A). To generate the IC50 value in primary neurons, we used the same protocol as was used in LCLs to allow a direct comparison. The CP2 IC50 in neurons was 82.84μM (95% confidence interval 59.98 to 115.0), which was significantly higher compared to the mean IC50 33.64 ± 25.32 μM found for LCLs (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that neurons could tolerate equivalent if not higher concentrations of MCI inhibitor compared to the peripheral cells.

We next conducted a pharmacokinetic (PK) study to determine concentrations in brain and plasma using wild type mice treated with an oral dose of CP2 (25 mg/kg) found efficacious in multiple in vivo treatment paradigms (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015). The CP2 concentration in plasma and brain tissue was established over 24 h after a single oral administration (Fig. 4B–E). We found that the maximum concentration of CP2 in the brain was achieved 30 min after CP2 gavage and averaged at 263.9 ± 63.6 nM (Fig. 4B,D). The highest concentration of CP2 in plasma was achieved 1 h after gavage averaging at 11.47 ± 1.36 μM (Fig. 4C,E). These data indicate that the exposure of the brain cells to the efficacious doses of CP2 after oral administration was significantly below the IC50 values established in primary neurons. However, since the maximum peripheral concentration of CP2 in PK study was close to the range of lowest IC50 in LCLs, the signals identified in our study suggest that the safety of chronic administration of MCI inhibitors have to be monitored specifically in peripheral tissue where some toxicity may be anticipated in a small most susceptible human population.

4. Discussion

In our preclinical work focused on identifying novel therapeutic targets for AD, we delineate MCI as a small molecule druggable target with downstream signaling that engages multiple neuroprotective mechanisms alleviating cognitive decline and neurodegeneration (Stojakovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2015). Multiple translational validation studies using transgenic mouse models of AD or wild-type mice conducted in our laboratory failed to identify any toxicity associated with long-term treatment. The present study was designed to establish safety margins of a tool MCI inhibitor CP2 in human LCLs, a pharmacogenomic approach that could inform on potential liabilities of the compound and help to identify biomarkers of efficacy or toxicity before the transition of compounds to clinical trials (Wang and Weinshilboum, 2019). One of the major findings of the current study is the demonstration of the relative safety of CP2 administration. The CP2 IC50 values in LCLs were considerably high (μM range) compared to concentrations found efficacious in the long-term (up to 20 months of chronic administration) treatment in AD mice or PK studies (nM range) (Stojakovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019). Furthermore, experiments in primary cultures indicated that neurons tolerated CP2 better than the peripheral LCLs with higher IC50 value. Since neurons are the primary target of MCI inhibitors designed to alleviate neurodegeneration, these data provide additional support for the safety of this approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases. This agrees with the results of our studies demonstrating that CP2 treatment improved neuronal survival, morphology and function even when treatment was administered after the development of profound cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in old AD mice (Stojakovic et al., 2020; Stojakovic et al., 2021). However, the demonstration that few LCLs have the IC50 values almost in the range of plasma PK levels suggest that peripheral cells may be more sensitive to treatment with MCI inhibitors warranting the development of compounds with better selectivity, specificity and efficacy. Consistent with the in vivo studies in AD mice, we did not find significant sex specific differences regarding CP2 tolerance in human LCLs. However, cells from the individuals of HCA background were more sensitive to CP2 treatment. Currently, it is not clear why the HCA background predisposes to such sensitivity. Future studies should clarify this issue.

In the current study, we have identified 11 SNP loci and 64 genes significantly associated with CP2 log10IC50 at p-value &lt; 10−5 and p-value &lt; 10−4, respectively. The eQTL analysis found that the expression of three genes was positively (CYP2A6, SPTBN4 and CHST11), and the expression of one gene (TXNRD1) was negatively associated with CP2 treatment sensitivity. The IPA networks identified additional 12 genes positively and 8 genes negatively correlated with CP2 log10IC50 values directly or indirectly implicated in the development of neurons or neurological diseases. Some of the identified associations were consistent with the molecular mechanism of CP2 established previously. For example, among GWAS-determined SNPs with a significant association with CP2 IC50 values was GABBR2 that codes a member of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor family that interacts with GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system that mediates the synaptic inhibition of neuronal excitability in the mammalian brain (Ng et al., 1999). Other protein coding genes, VWC2 and NUMBL, are involved in neurogenesis (Koike et al., 2007; Nieber et al., 2013). These findings are consistent with our recent data generated using the next-generation RNA sequencing in the brain tissue of CP2-treated AD mice that indicate the involvement of CP2 in neuronal development and neurotransmission (Stojakovic et al., 2021). Interestingly, we identified changes only in three genes related to mitochondrial function that could communicate a warning toward the application of MCI inhibitors in humans (CISD3, CYB5RL and COX2). The COX2 gene is the only one that is encoded by mtDNA. Furthermore, few protein-coding genes that have a significant association with CP2 IC50 were related to tumorigenesis (e.g., RP11–696F12.1, RP11–696F12.1, RP11–696F12.1, RP11–809H16.5, JAKMIP2, OPCML). This agrees with our unpublished data suggesting that CP2 treatment could suppress tumorigenesis. Indeed, another MCI inhibitor, IACS-010759, is currently evaluated in clinical trials to treat acute myeloid leukemia (Molina et al., 2018).

One of the important observations of this study was the association of CP2 treatment with the expression of CYP2A6, which varied based on the racial background. The expression of CYP family enzymes is important for drug metabolism, which may explain differential sensitivity to CP2 based on the level of expression. Changes in the gene expression of multiple CYP family members (e.g., CYP2C19, CYP2D6) were recently paired to specific drugs and included in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record system as the “alerts” informing physicians of potential detrimental outcomes of treatment in patients (Wang and Weinshilboum, 2019). In future studies, it will be important to specifically address the association between CYP2A6 and novel small molecules MCI inhibitors preclinical drug candidates currently under the development in our laboratory.

Metformin is the FDA-approved drug to treat Type 2 diabetes. It is one of the most widely prescribed drugs with a concentration in plasma reported in the mM range. Since metformin, among other cellular targets, inhibits MCI (Fontaine, 2018), its chronic application in the aging population further supports the general safety of MCI inhibitors. It is important to note that compared to metformin, CP2 and novel compounds developed based on the understanding of the molecular target and the mechanisms of neuroprotection have significantly better the blood-brain barrier penetrance, specificity and selectivity to the known molecular target in nM range, and bioavailability making them superior to the unspecific targeting of MCI by metformin. A number of pharmacogenomics studies were conducted in order to improve efficacy and avoid occasional serious adverse reactions of metformin (Wang and Weinshilboum, 2014). The identified genes were associated with metformin transporters and the mechanism of action, AMPK signaling in particular (Wang and Weinshilboum, 2014). We previously conducted metformin GWAS using the same LCLs as in the current study (Niu et al., 2016). We identified 198 mRNA expression probe sets and 12 SNP loci associated with metformin IC50 with p-values &lt;10−4 or &lt;10−5, respectively. Integrated SNP/methylation loci-expression-IC50 analyses found 3 SNP loci or 5 DNA methylation loci associated with metformin IC50 through trans-regulation of expression of 11 or 26 genes with p-value &lt;10−4. Functional validation of the top 61 candidate genes in 4 IPA networks indicated that downregulation of 14 genes significantly altered metformin sensitivity in two cell lines. Similar to metformin, our GWAS identified 11 SNP loci and 64 genes significantly correlated with CP2 log10(IC50). However, none of the top signals were overlapped between CP2 and metformin GWAS, suggesting that the mechanisms of these MCI inhibitors are not identical. This may be explained by the promiscuity of metformin compared to the high selectivity of CP2. Nevertheless, one of the top candidates, STUB1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the proteasome-dependent degradation of many proteins (Vernochet et al., 2012), was found to influence metformin sensitivity through its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for cyclin A. While this particular gene was not identified in our GWAS, few genes that were associated with CP2 treatment related to the proteasome degradation, including the CTSA, which encodes a cathepsin A protein that acts as a protease (Hiraiwa, 1999), and SMCR8 and COPZ1 that are involved in autophagy (Claerhout et al., 2012; Jung and Behrends, 2020), a mechanism shown to be induced by CP2 in vivo (Stojakovic et al., 2021).

The utility of LCLs has been previously validated in multiple studies (48). We performed GWAS using LCLs from three different ethnic groups and adjusted for sex and ethnicity, which allowed having a reasonable power. Still, this model has its limitations. The EBV transformation used to generate these cell lines could cause chromosomal instability and cellular changes in the LCLs. Variation in drug response could be affected by nongenetic factors such as cell growth rate or baseline ATP levels (Niu et al., 2010). In addition, the regulation of gene expression is tissue specific. Therefore, we established CP2 IC50 in primary neurons in vitro and compared to in vivo CP2 concentrations in plasma and brain tissue of mice treated with efficacious CP2 oral dose. These data demonstrate that peripheral cells appear to be more sensitive to the concentrations of MCI inhibitors compared to the brain cells. Another limitation of the study includes the lack of equal representation of males and females in each racial group, precluding from the accurate determination of potential sex-specific response to treatment where males and females were pulled together for the analysis regardless of the race. The LCLs utilized in this study were from relatively young donors. However, it is well known that mitochondrial function, including the expression of components of the OXPHOS machinery, decline with age and particularly during the development of neurodegeneration. The outcomes of our study do not allow to conclude to what extent aging, a presence of SNPs or mutations that could specifically affect the expression and function of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, the OXPHOS in particular, could interfere with CP2 tolerance. Future studies will need to address these important questions.

In summary, our data generated in human LCLs provide the first evidence that the application of MCI inhibitor tool compound CP2 is generally safe. Genes found to play a potential role in affecting CP2 cytotoxicity were related to drug metabolism, while higher expression of genes involved in antioxidant response appears to increase CP2 tolerance. Except for COX2, no significant associations were found with the expression of the components of mitochondrial OXPHOS machinery, indicating the lack of significant safety concerns with targeting MCI, at least in the healthy population. This study provides further support for the development of mitochondria-targeted therapeutics as a novel strategy for AD and informs on potential biomarkers of safety to be considered in future drug development efforts.
