Background and Purpose:

The amygdalae are deep brain nuclei critical to emotional processing and the creation and storage of memory. It is not known whether the amygdalae are affected by brain radiotherapy (RT). We sought to quantify dose-dependent amygdala change one year after brain RT.

Materials and Methods:

52 patients with primary brain tumors were retrospectively identified. Study patients underwent high-resolution, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging before RT and 1 year afterward. Images were processed using FDA-cleared software for automated segmentation of amygdala volume. Tumor, surgical changes, and segmentation errors were manually censored. Mean amygdala RT dose was tested for correlation with amygdala volume change 1 year after RT via the Pearson correlation coefficient. A linear mixed-effects model was constructed to evaluate potential predictors of amygdala volume change, including age, tumor hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and bevacizumab treatment during the study period. As 51 of 52 patients received chemotherapy, possible chemotherapy effects could not be studied. A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results:

Mean amygdala RT dose (r=−0.28, p=0.01) was significantly correlated with volume loss. On multivariable analysis, the only significant predictor of amygdala atrophy was radiation dose. The final linear mixed-effects model estimated amygdala volume loss of 0.17% for every 1 Gy increase in mean amygdala RT dose (p=0.008).

Conclusions:

The amygdala demonstrates dose-dependent atrophy one year after radiotherapy for brain tumors. Amygdala atrophy may mediate neuropsychological effects seen after brain RT.

Introduction

The amygdalae are medial temporal lobe nuclei critical for processing emotions 1-3 and both the creation and storage of memory4. They have been implicated in cognitive and emotional changes in patients with a wide variety of neurological diseases, including mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, Huntington disease, Alzheimer disease, and frontotemporal dementia5-9. In patients with brain tumors, damage to the amygdalae has been associated with precipitation of neuropsychological symptoms, including impaired emotional recognition, anxiety, and depression10,11. However, the potential for treatment-induced amygdala damage has not been well studied.

Brain radiotherapy (RT) is standard for patients with brain tumors, but is associated with neuropsychological decline12. Up to 50-90% of brain RT patients who survive &gt;6 months after treatment experience some neuropsychological decline, a significant concern for patient quality of life13-16. Memory loss is among the most common deficits16. Patients with brain tumors also have high rates of depression, stress, and anxiety17-19. Efforts to reduce treatment-related toxicity may be improved by identification of neuroanatomical structures that not only are critical to cognitive and emotional function, but also exhibit RT dose-dependent damage20,21. The amygdala is the primary brain structure responsible for emotional control and processing, and it acts synergistically with the adjacent hippocampus to form memories with emotional context22.

In the present study, we aimed to quantify the effects of brain RT on the amygdala using longitudinal, volumetric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Previous work with quantitative MRI found RT dose-dependent atrophy of the hippocampus, and recent prospective clinical trial data showed that lower hippocampal RT doses better preserves cognition23-25. We hypothesized that the nearby amygdala would also exhibit radiation dose-dependent atrophy, a finding that might justify study of amygdala dysfunction in brain tumor survivors, as well as strategies to reduce negative effects on patient quality of life. Such evidence is important because amygdala damage could have considerable impact on a patient’s cognitive and/or emotional functioning, while going poorly appreciated in routine clinical follow-up, where thorough neuropsychological evaluation is often lacking.

Methods

Patients

This study was conducted in accordance with approval by the Institutional Review Board. Fifty-eight adult patients with primary brain tumors treated from 2010-2014 with fractionated, partial-brain radiotherapy (1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction) were retrospectively identified. Doses received ranged from 50.4 Gy to 60 Gy (median 60 Gy). Inclusion criteria required that patients had standardized MR imaging prior to (or within the first week of) RT start and approximately one year after completion of RT and that patients did not receive prior RT. Six patients were excluded: 5 for poor image quality and 1 for large surgical resection that prevented the automated segmentation from completing. Thus, the final patient cohort comprised 52 patients.

Image Acquisition, Processing, and Amygdalae Delineation

MRIs were acquired before or within the first week of RT initiation and approximately 1 year (range: 9-15 months) after RT using a standardized protocol at our institution using a 3T Signa Excite HDx system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with an 8-channel head coil, as described previously24. Images acquired include 3D volumetric T1-weighted inversion recovery spoiled gradient-echo sequence (TE, 2.8 ms; TR, 6.5 ms; TI, 450 ms) obtained pre- and post- administration of intravenous gadolinium contrast and a 3D T2-weighted Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (TE, 126 ms; TR, 6000 ms; TI, 1863 ms). All images were visually reviewed independently by two physicians for quality control prior to further image processing.

Pre-contrast T1-weighted images were processed using NeuroQuant (CorTechs Labs, Inc, La Jolla, CA), to auto-segment the amygdala. NeuroQuant has received US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene clearance for clinical use in measuring amygdala volume. Full segmentation is based upon a probabilistic atlas; details have been previously described26. Volume measurements (in mL) with a color overlay for each amygdala were generated (Figure 1). All color images were visually reviewed by two radiation oncologists for quality assurance of accurate processing. Individual amygdalae were manually censored if the tumor or surgical bed caused poor segmentation.

Amygdala RT Dose Determination

These auto-segmented pre-contrast T1-weighted images were then rigidly co-registered to each patient’s RT plan (computed tomographic [CT] simulation images); full methodology is described elsewhere24,27. This registration was visually confirmed for accuracy and the RT dose from the CT images was resampled into the T1-weighted MRI volume space.

Statistical Analyses

Analyses were performed using SciPy28, a Python-based mathematical computing software (www.scipy.org), and the R environment for statistical computing29. A two-tailed p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The mean and maximum RT dose to each amygdala were calculated using the registered RT dose data and segmented MRI. For patients receiving other than 30 RT fractions, RT doses were converted at each voxel location in the volume to a 30-fraction biologically equivalent dose, using an α/β for brain tissue of 2 Gy, for direct comparison30,31.

Change in amygdala volume was defined as the difference between the volume at 1-year post-RT and the pre-RT volume. Percent change in amygdala volume was calculated as the change in amygdala volume divided by the pre-RT volume for each amygdala. A Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to determine if a relationship existed between mean (or maximum) dose to an individual amygdala and percent volume change.

As a secondary illustration of effect size, the median and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated for amygdalae receiving relatively higher and lower RT dose. Based on a published breakpoint analysis of radiation dose-related atrophy in cortical gray matter, amygdalae were analyzed depending on whether they received doses ≥ or &lt; 34.6 Gy27.

Finally, a linear mixed-effects (LME) model was created using lme4 version 1.1-7 in R to test for other potential predictors of amygdala volume change. The dependent variable was defined as percent volume change, with a patient-specific random intercept. Mean dose to each individual amygdala was included as the primary fixed effect. Age, hemisphere (left or right), sex, history of one or more major seizures during the study period (generalized tonic-clonic or status epilepticus), and history of bevacizumab treatment during the study period were added as potential fixed-effects predictors. As 51 of the 52 patients in our cohort received chemotherapy during the study period (50 of whom received concurrent chemoradiotherapy), chemotherapy was not included as a potential predictor in the model. The addition of each of these potential covariates was evaluated in a forward, stepwise fashion using a likelihood ratio test; each covariate was included as a fixed effect in the final model if p&lt;0.05. Restricted maximum likelihood was used to estimate the fixed effects parameters in the final model.

Results

Patients

The demographics of the 52 patients included in this study are detailed in Table 1. Briefly, the majority of patients were male (n=35, 67%), and the median age of patients at the time of treatment was 54 years (range 19-77). Most patients had grade III-IV glioma (n=42, 81%). The most common tumor locations were frontal lobe (n=18, 35%) and temporal lobe (n=16, 31%). All patients were treated with intensity modulated RT, and most patients (n=42, 81%) received 30 fractions of partial-brain RT. The vast majority of patients received chemotherapy during the study period (n=51, 98%). Fifteen patients (29%) had a major seizure during the study period and ten (19%) patients received bevacizumab.

Amygdala Analysis

After censoring for effects of tumor, surgery, or segmentation error, 40 right and 44 left amygdalae (total of 84 amygdalae) were included in the analyses. No patient had both amygdalae censored. Mean dose to the amygdala (r=−0.28, p=0.01) was significantly correlated with volume loss, Figure 2. Maximum dose to the amygdala (r=−0.28, p=0.01) was also significantly correlated with volume loss. Fourteen amygdalae received ≥34.6 Gy. The median volume percent change in these amygdalae was −5.74% (IQR: −16.67, 1.84). In the 70 amygdalae that received &lt;34.6 Gy, the median volume percent change was 1.92% (IQR: −3.82, 8.15).

Results of linear mixed-effects modeling with RT dose as the main fixed effect and patient (random effect) as predictors of amygdale volume change are presented in Table 2. No other covariates (age, hemisphere, patient sex, seizure history, or bevacizumab history) significantly contributed to the model after likelihood ratio testing (p&gt;0.05 for these covariates). The dose estimate for the final model, −0.17, corresponds to the rate of amygdala percent volume loss observed for every 1 Gy increase in mean dose received to the structure (p=0.008).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal evaluation of radiotherapy effects on the amygdala. In adults with primary brain tumors, we found radiation dose-dependent atrophy of the amygdala. On multivariable analysis, only RT dose significantly predicted for amygdala atrophy. The amygdalae are crucial to the processing of emotion and the emotional aspects of memory, and our study suggests that the clinical effects of brain RT on these structures need to be further investigated as they could lead to, or exacerbate, emotion dysregulation in patients with brain tumors.

Changes to the amygdala have been associated with impairment of patient function and cognition in a number of neurological and neuropsychological disorders. In patients with Huntington disease, smaller amygdala volumes were found to be associated with worse cognitive and motor performance in symptomatic patients7. Even in pre-symptomatic patients with Huntington disease, smaller amygdalae volumes were associated with increased anxiety levels7. In a series of military veterans, those with PTSD had significantly smaller amygdala volume (3.5% smaller in the left and 5.0% smaller in the right) than trauma-exposed veterans without PTSD32. The amygdala has also been implicated in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy5. Additionally, in some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, the epileptogenic focus involves the amygdala33. Seizures are of particular interest in the brain tumor population, as they can be the presenting symptom in 20-40% of patients, and up to 45% of these patients can also develop seizures throughout the course of their disease34. While we did not find that a history of major seizures during the study period was predictive of amygdala atrophy, larger cohorts may reveal a potential relationship.

The amygdala also plays a role in diseases that affect older adults, including Alzheimer disease. Amygdala atrophy has been correlated with global symptom severity in patients with Alzheimer disease; interestingly, amygdala atrophy was also associated with abnormal motor behavior in these patients, with possible relationships to anxiety and irritability8. Moreover, the level of amygdala atrophy in that study was similar to levels of atrophy seen in the hippocampus. Decreased right amygdala volume has also been found to precede the initial clinical signs of cognitive decline in elderly patients6. Research evaluating the impact of aging on the amygdala has shown that healthy aging does not significantly damage the amygdala structure35-37. Similarly, we found that age was not a significant predictor for amygdala volume change in our cohort of brain tumor patients, as opposed to previously described results in the hippocampus24. Amygdala atrophy and its effects on patients in any of these neurological contexts could easily go undetected in current routine clinical follow-up, where specialized cognitive testing is not readily available, making quantitative neuroimaging techniques especially attractive.

Amygdala volumes have also been associated with impaired neuropsychological and social function in cancer patients. In a cross-sectional series of breast cancer survivors, patients who had intrusive recollections (symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) had smaller amygdala volumes determined on MRI compared to breast cancer controls without intrusive recollections38. Another study evaluating the relationship between amygdala volume and depression in breast cancer survivors revealed that left amygdala volumes were smaller in patients who had experienced a depressive episode39. Additionally, high levels of social support in breast cancer survivors have been linked with reduced amygdala reactivity and decreased inflammatory markers40.

Given the established association between amygdala atrophy and neuropsychological dysfunction in an array of brain disorders, the present finding of amygdala atrophy related to RT dose has intriguing potential implications for RT planning. Recently published literature evaluating RT effects on the amygdala showed a significant relationship between post-RT amygdala volumes and full-scale IQ and verbal learning memory in a series of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)41. In that study, children who received whole-brain RT (WBRT) with chemotherapy had smaller amygdala volumes than those treated with chemotherapy alone, but amygdala volumes were similar in controls (patients with ALL who had not yet started treatment) and children who received chemotherapy. Pre-clinical data also implicate radiotherapy to the amygdala in changes to olfactory memory processing: a study using a mouse model of pediatric radiotherapy revealed significant reductions in diffusion tensor imaging of amygdala volume three months post-WBRT42. Cognitively, irradiated male mice had impaired odor-recognition memory in adulthood, compared to non-irradiated males. Altogether, these data suggest that radiation to the amygdala can influence neuropsychological consequences after RT, particularly for memory.

Amygdala RT dose reduction is especially relevant when considering the amygdala’s close proximity to—and interactions with—the hippocampus, a structure that is already being studied for avoidance21. Both the amygdala and hippocampus reside in the medial temporal lobe and are critical parts of the limbic system circuitry. The hippocampus and amygdala both contribute to memory systems, with the hippocampus involved in the consolidation of long-term, episodic, or declarative memory (such as conscious fact-recall) and the amygdala more involved in emotional memory and memories with emotional context22,43. The amygdala and hippocampus also have neural connections thought to allow them to work in concert for the development and preservation of emotional and remote memory22,43,44. Physiologically, the basolateral complex of the amygdala has substantial projections to the memory structures of the medial temporal lobe, with afferents to the hippocampus45,46, while the hippocampus has reciprocal projections (mainly originating in the subicular region) that send sensory information to the amygdala45,47. The amygdala can therefore shape the coding and consolidation of hippocampal-dependent memories, while the hippocampus can create episodic representations of the emotional importance of specific stimuli, thus affecting the amygdala response to emotional events43. This connectivity may have implications for memory preservation in brain tumor patients. We have shown here that the amygdala demonstrates similar dose-dependent atrophy after RT to that previously shown in the hippocampus24, (r = −0.28 for the amygdala and −0.24 for the hippocampus).

Hippocampal avoidance in RT planning is already an active area of clinical research to improve memory preservation. The NRG-CC001 study randomized patients receiving memantine and WBRT to plans with or without hippocampal sparing. Preliminary results were presented recently and showed that patients who received hippocampal-sparing WBRT had greater memory preservation23. Of note, hippocampal avoidance in that trial was achieved via a 5 mm uniform expansion around the hippocampus, implying there was likely considerable dose reduction to the bilateral amygdalae, as well. While amygdala avoidance was not a focus of CC001, it is possible that the favorable dosimetry for the amygdala had some contribution to memory preservation.

It is also important to note that not all areas of the brain have been shown to have radiation dose-dependent atrophy. A prior study of RT-related changes to regions of the cerebral cortex demonstrated dose-dependent atrophy in the entorhinal and inferior parietal cortex (areas associated with memory and executive functioning), but not in the pericalcarine cortex or paracentral lobule (areas associated with vision and somatosensory/motor function)20. The radiation dose-dependent amygdala atrophy measured here is consistent with the observation that RT dose-dependent changes may be at least partially specific to areas of the brain associated with cognition20,21,24.

Limitations of our study include the retrospective design at a single institution. The majority of patients in our cohort had grade III or IV glioma. Future studies could include more patients with other primary brain tumors (who might benefit even more from cognitive-sparing radiotherapy). Though our patient cohort included more men than women, sex did not predict for amygdala atrophy. The potential effects of chemotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy could not be evaluated in this cohort as independent risk factors for amygdala atrophy because nearly all of the patients received chemotherapy as part of their clinical care. As such, we cannot determine whether chemotherapy causes amygdala atrophy or whether it interacts with the observed radiation dose. This is important, as chemotherapy has been suggested to potentiate brain gray matter volume loss48. There is also a potential synergistic effect of chemotherapy and RT on amygdala volumes: children with ALL who received methotrexate alone demonstrated amygdala volume loss, but those who received methotrexate along with brain RT had substantially increased volume decline41. We are, additionally, unable to quantify cognitive or emotional changes that may have occurred in these patients, as thorough neuropsychological data are not available. The effects of brain radiotherapy on amygdala function, and its potential role in mediating neuropsychological consequences, need to be evaluated in prospective studies; one is ongoing at our institution. We plan to further evaluate radiation dose-dependent amygdala changes in this study. Finally, radiation damage to the brain can evolve over time. A case report of a patient with glioblastoma showed unilateral hippocampal wasting that started shortly after completion of chemoradiation, then stabilized after six months (with follow-up to 20 months)49. While longitudinal trends for amygdala volume loss have not yet been reported, it is plausible that amygdala volumes can also change over time, and this should be investigated in future work.

In conclusion, we present the first evidence of radiation dose-dependent atrophy of the amygdala in patients with primary brain tumors. This amygdala volume loss may contribute to the neuropsychological sequelae observed in patients after brain RT.

Highlights

The amygdala is critical to emotional processing, fear recognition, and memory.

Radiation dose-dependent amygdala atrophy was measured in a retrospective cohort of 52 primary brain tumor patients who received fractionated, partial-brain radiotherapy.

Amygdala atrophy associated with radiation dose may contribute to neuropsychological deficits after brain radiotherapy.
