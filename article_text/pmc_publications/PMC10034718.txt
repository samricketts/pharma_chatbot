Increasing rates of dementia spectrum disorders among Spanish-speaking geriatric populations necessitate the development of culturally appropriate cognitive screening tests that can identify neurodegenerative disorders in their earliest stages when emerging disease-modifying treatments are most likely to be effective. This scoping review identified 26 brief Spanish language cognitive screening tools (&lt;20 minutes) by searching academic databases using a combination of search terms. Results suggest that the Mini-Mental Status Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment appear to be less valid than other screeners. Instruments such as the 7-Minute Screen and Mini-Cog evidence higher classification rates of dementia, while Phototest detected mild cognitive impairment at higher rates more consistently than other screeners. Different sensitivity and specificity outcomes and cutoffs were observed when the same cognitive screener was evaluated in different countries. Results indicate that it is imperative to increase nation-specific validation and normative data for these instruments to best serve diverse populations.

pmcBackground

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias (ADRDs) are broadly characterized by the decline of memory and deterioration in cognitive, social, and occupational functioning.1 These disorders are a major public health problem,2 currently affecting 2.4 to 5.5 million Americans.3 When detected early, secondary prevention and treatment may improve symptom management, slow disease progression, and allow for appropriate financial and lifestyle planning.4,5 Research indicates that 76% of patients with dementia are diagnosed in primary care settings, but general practitioners frequently miss early symptoms, which delays correct diagnosis to moderate or severe stages when symptoms are more apparent.3 Tsoi et al2 have reported that 25% to 95% of dementias are misdiagnosed when patients first present symptoms. Therefore, it is of critical importance that appropriate and adequate cognitive screening instruments are employed to improve diagnostic accuracy and identify individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who may not have experienced a significant loss of social or occupational function,6 as well as those with significant, later stage impairment.

Allied health professionals (such as physicians, nurses, and social workers) can utilize cognitive screeners within practice settings to screen for potential cognitive impairment and dementia. Practitioners employ these screening tools during intake, psychosocial history information gathering, specific cognitive state examination, physical health screenings, and medication review.7 Most cognitive screening tools are not time-intensive and can appropriately assess for current cognitive functioning.2 It is recommended that all old adults, as well as younger patients who have identified risk factors for dementia, are routinely assessed for cognitive functioning and dementia presence.5,8 The Alzheimer’s Association recommends that patients with memory concerns, cognitive complaints, reported cognitive impairment, and Medicare beneficiaries receiving an Annual Wellness visit be screened.9

Important cross-cultural considerations such as acculturation, language barriers, and education should be taken into consideration when completing a cognitive screening.10 Over 4 million Hispanic older adults live in the United States, a number expected to grow by 224% by 2030, and will need appropriate cognitive screening to adequately address their evolving health-care needs.11 There is a lack of evidence and studies to support the efficacy of non-English language screeners. While detailed reports and systematic reviews have examined the efficacy of English language studies and reports,2,3,5 there has been clear lack of comparable Spanish language studies, with only a few in the literature to address this gap.12 Cognitive screeners that do not take language and cultural differences and nuances into consideration in the development of test items will result in cultural bias, even if a Spanish language translation of the original screener has occurred.13 Cultural differences can manifest themselves in various dimensions of screening, including the prioritization and completion of daily tasks.10,13 Therefore, an examination of current cognitive screening tools and their efficacy in Spanish form and content is a critical step toward developing culturally appropriate, widely available, and accurate screening tools that can be used in diverse practice settings. This scoping review addresses the following questions: (1) What cognitive screening tools have been developed for use with Spanish speakers? (2) How effective are current Spanish language cognitive screeners at detecting a cognitive decline in MCI and dementia? and (3) What direction and form should future research take to support the development of Spanish form and content cognitive screeners that improve early detection of dementia in diverse primary care settings?

Methods

Unlike systematic reviews, which pose specific research questions and assess the quality of individual studies, scoping reviews often pose broader research questions and seek “to examine the extent, range and nature of research activity”14(p21) in new, large, or methodologically diverse areas of study.15 This may be done to identify gaps in current research, to summarize and disseminate findings, or to determine whether a systematic review is appropriate and necessary.16 Universal guidelines for scoping reviews have not been established, but Arksey’s and O’Malley’s14 methodological framework has been widely influential. It includes 5 primary steps: (1) identify the research question, (2) identify relevant studies, (3) study selection, (4) chart the data, and (5) collate, summarize and report the results. Ideally, this process should be transparent and replicable.14

Literature Search

Screens were identified by searching electronic databases (Biosis, Embase, CINAHL, EBSCOhost, Medline (Web of Science), and PsycINFO), using combinations of the following terms: “dementia,” “Alzheimer’s disease,” “cognitive impairment,” “mild cognitive impairment,” “screen*,” “Spanish,” “sensitivity,” and “specificity.” Individual test names were also used as search terms. In addition, the reference lists of appraised papers were manually searched for applicable content. There was no lower limit placed on years searched to capture as much relevant data as possible. The database search yielded 140 articles after duplicates were removed. Sixty-four of the 140 articles were removed through title and abstract review. The remaining 76 articles received a full-text review. Of the 76 articles, 32 did not relate directly to the study and were excluded, which left 46 articles for close review. A close review of these 46 articles resulted in the identification of 19 additional articles that did not appear in the database search, for a total of 65 articles. Twenty-six screeners that met the study criteria emerged from these 65 articles. Figure 1 depicts the visual representation of the database search results.

Selection Criteria

Screening tests were included if they were designed to screen for dementia spectrum cognitive impairment or had been used for that purpose and had an administration time of fewer than 20 minutes. Screens could be administered directly to patients or be partly or fully informant-rated. Individual papers relating to each screen were included if they: were the original paper presenting the content of the screen; presented data relating to the screening aspects of the test (as opposed to nonrelevant aspects such as factor structure); presented data relating to the performance of the test as it stands alone (ie, sensitivity and specificity data). Validity studies must also have employed acceptable “gold standard” diagnostic criteria (ie, based on international diagnostic guidelines or clinical judgment following a full assessment battery); the use of another screening test as the gold standard was not acceptable. Where denoted, the test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate). Test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate). However, in the field of ophthalmology, Parikh et al17 have provided an excellent overview of sensitivity, specificity, as well as how base rates of underlying conditions affect positive and negative predictive values. For example, a test may have high sensitivity for a specific condition (due to attributes of a test) but low negative predictive power based on low base rates in the population.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted for each screen by 1 author (Author 1). A list of cognitive, psychiatric, and functional domains/abilities covered by each test was made independently by 2 of the authors (Authors 1 and 2), and a final list was agreed upon by consensus, with Author 3 consulted as necessary. Thirteen of the 26 Spanish language cognitive screeners were evaluated by 3 or more studies and serve as the focus of this scoping review. Summarized results are visually displayed in Tables 1 and 2. The remaining 13 cognitive screeners are outlined in the Additional Cognitive Screeners section.

Results

Patient Performance Measures

Mini-Mental Status Examination

First developed in 1975, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and includes 11 domains that evaluate orientation, attention, immediate recall, short-term recall, language, attention/calculation, comprehension, writing, and drawing/construction46,47 The MMSE is among the most commonly used cognitive screening instruments, especially among older adults at risk of MCI and Alzheimer disease (AD); however, early research identified that age, education, and ethnic status significantly influence test outcomes, including Hispanic older adults.48,49 A study by Grober and colleagues18 yielded a high sensitivity (83%) for detecting very mild dementia and specificity (85%) for individuals with 5 to 9 years of education tested in English. However, applying the same cutoff score for individuals with 7 to 8 years of education tested in Spanish yielded high specificity (88%) but low sensitivity (48%). These comparisons demonstrated that results may differ by education, the language of administration, and Latino subgroup based on the country of origin.18 Results of a study conducted by Spering and colleagues50 found that an MMSE cutoff score of 27 for college-educated Hispanics generally yielded high specificity (96%) but low sensitivity (59%) compared to the lower cutoff score of 24 (100% and 38%, respectively) when assessing for MCI and probable AD. However, specificity is improved to 93.9% at the cutoff score of 24 through the use of age and education adjustments developed by Mungas and colleagues.49 Similarly, Blesa and colleagues19 developed age and education-based adjustments in their Spanish study, which yielded 87.32% sensitivity and 89.19% specificity detecting dementia.

Studies conducted in Latin America have also yielded varying sensitivity and specificity outcomes based on education. An early study (n = 430) by Ostrosky-Solis and colleagues47 found that sensitivity and specificity varied significantly based on education in their Mexican sample. At a cutoff score of 23/24, Ostrosky-Solis et al47 observed 50% sensitivity and 72.73% specificity for participants with 0 and 1 to 4 years of education, 86.36% sensitivity and specificity for participants with 5 to 9 years of education, and 87% sensitivity and 71% specificity when participants had 10 or more years of education. They report that no education and low-education individuals had scores similar to those with severe and mild dementia, respectively. Ostrosky-Solis et al47(p29) noted that education level affected “reading, writing and calculation” questions most and that cultural differences may also affect outcomes on questions that reference changing seasons and governmental structure (“the state”). That same year, a large population-based study of urban and rural Colombian older adults (n = 1611) observed high sensitivity (92.3%) but low specificity (53.7%) even when accounting for education by providing various cutoff points based on years of education.51 Unlike other studies, sex differences were also observed for participants with very low-education levels (&lt;5 years). When researchers sought to validate the MMSE with Chilean older adults (n = 94), they found that a cutoff score of 21/22 yielded similarly high sensitivity (93.6%) and but low specificity (46.1%), even after spelling and shape drawing items were adapted to low-education individuals. Scores improved to 94.4% and 80.3%, however, with the addition of the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ) which assesses activities of daily living.52 Alternately, Beaman and colleagues53 compared 3 scoring procedures to determine which yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity among low-education Mexican participants and found that awarding full points on 4 education-sensitive items to those with 3 or fewer years of education resulted in 97% sensitivity and 88% specificity, which was superior to both traditional scoring methods and adaptation of items that were highly education-sensitive.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is another commonly used cognitive screening instrument among elderly individuals. The MoCA is a brief screening instrument for MCI and AD consisting of memory, executive function, attention, orientation, language, and visuospatial function subscales and takes approximately 10 minutes to administer.54 It was developed to address the limitations of the MMSE and is more effective at detecting early MCI55 and those at high risk of dementia.56 It has also been able to identify subtle but clinically relevant cognitive deficits with greater frequency than MMSE, especially in populations with MCI and chronic heart failure57 and acute ischemic stroke.58 The MoCA is designed to be more sensitive to minor cognitive deficits than the MMSE and thus may be a superior screening instrument for MCI and vascular AD, as well as chronic heart failure, stroke, and Parkinson disease.59 In addition, the MoCA consists of subscales, including memory, executive function, attention, orientation, language, and visuospatial function, which increases the sensitivity of this instrument over the MMSE.60 A study conducted by Hoops and colleagues59 found that the MoCA performs similarly to the MMSE but is superior as a screening measure for MCI and cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease. The optimal screening cutoff point is 26 (sensitivity 83% and specificity 53%) for the MoCA. However, previous studies have demonstrated that the MoCA’s normative data are limited because it was developed on a sample of healthy Canadians with 13 years of education.61 Although the MoCA has been extensively studied to detect MCI and AD in diverse populations and in a variety of languages, Spanish-speaking populations were the exception62 until recently. Zhou and colleagues63 examined the Spanish version of the MoCA with a Hispanic, US-based sample and discovered that a cutoff score of 18 yields the best balance between sensitivity (91%) and specificity (81%) in distinguishing between MCI, subjective memory decline, and AD. A study (n = 168) by Aguilar-Navarro et al20 yielded similarly high sensitivity and specificity among Mexican participants diagnosed with MCI and dementia. A cutoff score of 26 balanced sensitivity and specificity at 80% and 75%, respectively, for detecting MCI, while a cutoff score of 24 resulted in 98% sensitivity and 93% specificity when identifying dementia. Aguilar-Navarro et al64 note that neither education nor age influenced results but acknowledge that their sample had a mean education of 11 years. Gil et al21 highlight that their Colombian sample (n = 193) also had a high mean education. A cutoff score of 23 yielded 76.0% sensitivity and 79.8% specificity among participants diagnosed with MCI and 92.7% sensitivity and 79.8% specificity for those diagnosed with dementia. To address the impact of low education, Gil et al added 1 point to the score of participants with less than 11 years of education. Similarly, in their assessment of Chilean participants diagnosed with MCI, Delgado et al64 found that adding 2 points to scores of participants with less than 8 years of education and 1 point to the scores of participants with 8 to 12 years of education adjusted for education’s impact on outcomes. Their study (n = 172) yielded 75% sensitivity and 82% specificity. Not all studies have produced high sensitivity when detecting dementia. An earlier study by Lozano Gallego et al65 with Spanish participants (n = 103) observed similar sensitivity and specificity when detecting MCI (71.4% and 74.5%, respectively, at a cutoff score of 21) but detected dementia with 84.3% sensitivity and 71.0% specificity at a score of 14 or less.

Mini-Cog

The Mini-Cog is a widely used examination with an average time completion of 3 minutes.9 This test assesses for cognitive vital signs9 including memory, executive function, attention, speed of processing, visual–spatial, and visual context.66 Advantages to the utilization of the Mini-Cog are that it was developed in a primary setting and takes diverse educational, linguistic, and cultural nuance biases into consideration as it simply tests for recall and clock drawing.24 To that end, the test is relatively free of bias. However, different word lists in different languages have an impact on failure rate and time length for administration.9 A mixed-language study by Borson and colleagues24 featured multilinguistic options of English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, and Filipino dialect; the test showed 99% sensitivity and 96% specificity in dementia classification. Furthermore, education and language differences did not influence the test results.24 Alternately, Carnero-Pardo and colleagues’67 study (n = 581) which was conducted in Spain yielded 90% sensitivity and 71% specificity at a cutoff score of 2/3 but found that low-education level impacted diagnostic utility so significantly that they discouraged the use of the Mini-Cog in adults with low-education attainment.

Seven-Minute Screen

The function of the 7-Minute Screen is to distinguish between patients with AD and those with normal cognitive functioning. It consists of a battery of 4 brief tests: Enhanced Cued Recall, Temporal Orientation, Verbal Fluency, and Clock Drawing.68 This test is highly advantageous due to its ability to be administered in a short amount of time.25 It requires minimal training, no clinical judgment, and has reasonable inter-rater and test–retest reliability.25 When tested in English, this assessment demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 100% in testing for AD.25 In a study conducted with 527 Spanish-speaking community-dwelling older adults in Spain, this test was found to demonstrate 100% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity rates for the detection of dementia.69 A later, smaller study also comprised of Spanish older adults (n = 92) observed high sensitivity and specificity, 93% and 97%, respectively, detecting probable AD dementia but yielded such low sensitivity detecting MCI (28%) that the authors declared that the 7-minute screen is an inappropriate tool for detection of MCI in primary care settings.26

Memory Impairment Screen

The Memory Impairment Screen (MIS) is a brief cognitive screening assessment that utilizes 4 questions to engage in a “delayed-free and cued-recall” test to determine memory impairment.70 Advantages to the MIS are that it includes verbal memory testing without the need for writing or drawing and has minimal education bias. However, it does not test executive function or visual–spatial skills.9 A study utilizing the MIS yielded a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 97% in AD classification.28 A Spanish adaption of the MIS, from a study of 403 hospital patients in Barcelona, yielded a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 96% at detecting dementia and 86% sensitivity and 96% specificity when testing for AD.29 Barrero-Hernandez et al’s71 study (n = 101) from the following year found that a cutoff score of 4 yielded 83.7% sensitivity and 72.6% specificity discriminating between participants with and without dementia. Perez-Martinez and colleagues72 sought to create a fully “cross-cultural adaptation,” which yielded greater sensitivity and specificity detecting MCI and dementia: 91.9% and 81.0% at a cutoff of 4 or less, and 96.1% and 72.6% at a cutoff of 3 or less, respectively. Evaluation with an Argentinian sample (n = 183) yielded 82.95% sensitivity and 90.24% specificity at a cutoff score of 6 for “general dementia” and 85.19% sensitivity and 95.12% specificity for AD at a cutoff score of 5.73 Another Argentinian study identified that a cutoff of 7.5 yielded a sensitivity of 87.26 and specificity of 75.68 among older adults with cognitive impairment.74

Abbreviated Fuld Object Memory Evaluation

The Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME) was developed in 1981 and subsequently validated in 1990.75 The FOME tests for memory recall of 10 household objects and has been noted for its usefulness and efficacy in individuals in different language groups.30 The 3-trial version of the FOME takes approximately 8 to 10 minutes to administer and has been found to be more related to medial temporal lobe atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging relative to other memory measures as well as having no language effect (English vs Spanish).76 In AD evaluation, the 5-trial FOME yielded a sensitivity of 95.9% and specificity of 100% in classifying demented AD Spanish speakers from cognitively normal Spanish speakers while a 1-trial version yielded with a cutoff score of fewer than 5 targets yielded a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 87%.30

Rideaux and colleagues administered the abbreviated 3-group trial to discern between normal cognitive functioning and types of impaired cognition. The results of this 3-group trial demonstrated efficacy in discernment between individuals with normal cognitive functioning versus dementia, normal cognitive functioning versus cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND), and individuals with CIND versus dementia. Study authors diagnosed CIND when participants “scored below expectation and 1.5 standard deviations below established testing norms.”77(p373) Spanish-speaking individuals yielded the following sensitivities and specificities: 92% sensitivity and 93% specificity between normal functioning patients and those with dementia; 93% sensitivity and 57% specificity between normal functioning and patients with cognitive impairment; and 69% sensitivity and 85% specificity between those with cognitive impairment and those with dementia.77

Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination, -Revised, and -III

Like the MoCA, Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) was developed to address the MMSE’s limitations and sought to improve early detection of AD and differentiation between AD and other dementias. The ACE includes the MMSE but adds additional content to assess verbal fluency and expands components that measure language, memory, and visuospatial skills.78 A Spanish language version of the ACE administered to high-education Argentinian AD and frontotemporal patient groups (n = 128, mean years of education = 12) yielded a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 96.2% at a cutoff score of 86.79 Addressing concerns about the impact of education on outcomes, Garcia-Caballero et al79 sought to adapt and validate the ACE with rural, low-education Spanish elders (n = 267) and found that an adjusted cutoff score of 68 resulted in 90% sensitivity and 86% specificity detecting dementia. A later study of Peruvian participants yielded even greater sensitivity and specificity (both at 100%) with a cutoff score of 86 to detect AD and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).80

After the ACE was revised in 2006 to improve administration experience and transcultural adaptation and to reduce learning and ceiling effects, Torralva et al81 conducted an initial study of the screener with Argentinian AD, FTD, and control participant groups (n = 127). An adjusted cutoff score of 85 resulted in 97.5% sensitivity and 88.5% specificity. Investigating the ACE-Revised (ACE-R) with Chilean older adults yielded 92% sensitivity and 93% specificity at a cutoff score of 76 for dementia, while 86% sensitivity and 62% specificity was observed identifying MCI.82 A later study assessing ACE-R’s ability to discriminate between subcortical ischemic vascular dementia and AD (n = 83) yielded 100% sensitivity and specificity at a cutoff score of 88.83 Due to MMSE-related patent issues, the ACE-III was developed to replace the ACE-R.32 Hsieh and colleagues32 found that the English language version of the ACE-III, which yielded 100% sensitivity and 96% specificity detecting dementia, was comparable to the ACE-R. The ACE-III was validated and normed with a Spanish sample (n = 217) by Matias-Guiu et al33 who identified differences in performance based on education level. Among participants with more than 10 years of education, Matias-Guiu et al found that a 73.5 cutoff yielded sensitivity and specificity scores of 90.5% and 96.7%, respectively, at identifying dementia. Dementia among those with education levels of less than 10 years was best identified with a cutoff of 61.5 which resulted in 82.3% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity. To assess the Spanish language ACE-III with a Latin American sample, Bruno and colleagues34 administered the ACE-III to Argentinian and Chilean participants (n = 240) and found 98.5% sensitivity and 82.01% specificity at a cutoff score of 86.

Test Your Memory

Test Your Memory (TYM) is a 10-item, self-administered cognitive assessment of orientation, executive function, memory, coping, verbal fluency, naming, visuospatial skills, calculation, and semantic knowledge.35 Initial validation of TYM with English speakers yielded 93% sensitivity and 86% specificity detecting participants with AD.35 Muñoz-Neira et al84 adapted the TYM to Spanish with a convenience sample of Chilean older adults attending a memory clinic (n = 74) and found that a cutoff score of 39 resulted in 93.1% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity differentiating those with dementia from controls. Among participants with MCI, a cutoff score of 44 resulted in best-balanced sensitivity (87.5%) and specificity (69%). Muñoz-Neira et al84 noted that education was correlated with TYM scores so additional normative data are necessary. Based on outcomes from their large study of Spanish older adults (n = 1049), Ferrero-Arias and Turrión-Rojo36 suggest adding 2 points to TYM scores of those with less than 9 years of education and 1 point to those with 9 to 12 years of education. They found that a cutoff score of 36 yielded 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for dementia and a cutoff score of 40 allowed for 86% sensitivity and 88% specificity for MCI. Alternately, an Argentinian sample85 (n = 150) comprised of cognitively normal participants and those with dementia yielded only minimal differences when participants were grouped by education: 84% sensitivity and 95% specificity among those with more than 6 years of education and 86% sensitivity and 93% specificity among those with less than 6 years of education at a cutoff of 40.

Money Tests

The Eurotest is a brief (~7 minutes)86 Spanish language cognitive screener that was developed to replace the money test after Spain’s adoption of the Euro in 2002.38 It assesses knowledge of coins and bills, ability to complete basic arithmetic through use of a legal tender, and memory via a money-based recall task. Evaluations of the Eurotest and its adaptations have found that it effectively identifies cognitive impairment among low education and illiterate older adults as it does not require the ability to read or write.38 Early development by Carnero-Pardo and Montoro-Ríos87 used a convenience sample (n = 60) comprised of 30 participants with mild dementia and 30 without dementia. In this initial evaluation, the Eurotest yielded 93% sensitivity and 87% specificity and was not impacted by education level. Carnero-Pardo et al38 completed a “naturalistic, multicenter” study in Spain (n = 516) which found a 20/21 cutoff score balanced sensitivity and specificity at 91% and 82%. Since its initial development, the Eurotest has been adapted to Latin American contexts. The Chilean adaptation—called the Weight Test—also used a convenience sample of participants with mild dementia diagnoses (n = 30) and without dementia (n = 30) which similarly found that a cutoff score of 20 produced the best balance of sensitivity (93%) and specificity (90%).88 Oscanoa et al’s89 larger Peruvian convenience sample (n = 84) that included participants with and without cognitive impairment, yielded 90.5% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity at a cutoff score of 24.

Phototest

Phototest is a very brief (~3 minutes), 3-part screening test that assesses language, executive function, and memory through the use of naming, verbal recall, and memory activities.90 Phototest was designed in Spain for use with illiterate or low-education patients and does not require reading or pen and paper use and was designed by the same team of researchers that developed the Eurotest.87 Early examination of the Phototest with 60 participants (30 diagnosed with dementia and 30 without a dementia diagnosis) found that it yielded 93% sensitivity and 80% specificity at a cutoff score of 27 or less and identified no differences in age, education, or sex.87 Follow-up examination by Carnero-Pardo et al91 with a larger, Spanish, and predominantly low-education sample comprised of cognitively normal participants and those diagnosed with dementia or cognitive impairment (n = 378) found that cutoff scores of 25/26 for participants with dementia yielded sensitivity and specificity scores of 88% and 90%, respectively, while a cutoff score of 28/29 among participants diagnosed with cognitive impairment best balanced sensitivity and specificity at 90%. Additional studies by Carnero-Pardo and colleagues39 sought to expand Phototest evaluation with a multicenter study (n = 589) in 2012 and found similar results, but in this case, clients diagnosed with mild AD dementia yielded 88% sensitivity and 87% specificity at a 26/27, while participants with amnestic MCI yielded lower sensitivity and specificity at the same cut-off score (71% and 84%, respectively). Since then Carnero-Pardo and colleagues have used cognitively normal participants to provide normative data based on age, sex, and education92 and compared the clinical and cost-effectiveness of Phototest (based on neuropsychiatric evaluation outcomes) with the MMSE, MIS,93 Eurotest, and Memory Alteration Test (M@T).86 Phototest outperformed the MMSE on both cost and diagnostic accuracy and can be used with illiterate patients, unlike MIS,93 and takes significantly less time to administer than M@T and Eurotest thus providing additional value for time-limited clinical settings.86 A systematic review and meta-analysis by Carnero-Pardo et al94 assessed 6 studies that yielded 85% sensitivity and 87% specificity at cutoff score of 26/27 among participants with dementia diagnoses and 80% sensitivity and 88% specificity among cognitive impairment participants at a 28/29 cutoff score.

Phototest has also been evaluated with Argentinian older adults.90 The sample (n = 147), which included participants with amnestic MCI and mild dementia, resulted in higher cutoff scores: 30/31 among amnestic participants with MCI best balanced sensitivity (85.25%) and specificity (90%), while a 27/28 cutoff score among participants with mild dementia yielded 89.29% sensitivity and 96.67% specificity.90

Informant Report Measures

Eight-Item Informant Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia

The final version of the Eight-item Informant Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia (AD8) measures memory, orientation, judgment,40 executive function, language function, cultural experience, visual context, and visual–spatial.66 This assessment was derived by a panel of dementia experts, and the format was derived from that of a semi-structured interview.40 The original English language study conducted by Galvin and colleagues40 reported a sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 86% with a cutoff score of 2 when screening for very mild dementia in a study of 189 participants. When 56 additional patients with mild to severe dementia were added, the sensitivity increased to 85%.40 Researchers have observed higher levels of sensitivity when validating the AD8 with Latin American samples. Carnero-Pardo and colleagues’41 large Spanish study (n = 401) yielded 93% sensitivity and 81% specificity cognitive impairment with a cutoff score of 3/4, while Blanco et al,95 working with a notably smaller Argentinian sample (n = 62), found that a cutoff score of 2 best balanced sensitivity and specificity at 80% and 83% when detecting dementia, and noted minor differences in translation choices from the Spanish study. Specificity detecting MCI was considerably lower at 44%. A similarly small Chilean study (n = 54) observed that a cutoff score of 2 produced 95% sensitivity and 86% specificity at detecting dementia.96

Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly

The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE) assesses cognition in executive functioning and cultural experience.66 This assessment utilizes the patients’ memory and intelligence through a battery of questions regarding everyday situations.97 The IQCODE attempts to overcome the problem of low English language acquisition by individuals with lower education and intelligence as well as cultural and linguistic differences by assessing change from earlier in life rather than the person’s current level of functioning. The test accomplishes this by making use of the informant’s knowledge of both the person’s earlier and current cognitive functioning.98 In 2014, a meta-analysis of 11 independent data sets and 10 papers from a 71-paper search yielded a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 84% in dementia classification for mild dementia.42 A 97-person urban study in Spain yielded a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 83% for dementia, while a 160-person study in rural Spain resulted in both a sensitivity and specificity of 83% for dementia.43 An earlier study by Morales et al99 found similar results: 86% sensitivity and 91% specificity. However, Del-Ser et al’s100 smaller Spanish sample (n = 53) yielded lower sensitivity (79%) and specificity (73%).

The Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire

The PFAQ consists of 11 questions that evaluate abilities associated with daily functioning.44 The scale takes approximately 2 to 3 minutes to complete.101 Responses range from 0 to 3, with larger numbers indicating increasing dependency.44 Pfeffer et al’s45 initial English language validation study yielded 85% sensitivity and 81% specificity when detecting dementia, while a more recent study that sought to differentiate MCI from dementia-diagnosed participants produced 80.3% sensitivity/87% specificity.102 Validity outcomes were not evaluated by education level. Results from a study with Mexican elders103 (n = 314), however, suggest that FAQ outcomes are influenced by education level: among illiterate participants, the screener yielded adequate results: 71% sensitivity and 79% specificity, but reductions in sensitivity were observed with low education participants (1-4 years, and 5-9 years). Both low education categories produced 36% sensitivity, while specificity remained high at 89% and 98%, respectively, at a cutoff of 7. So few participants completed more than 9 years of education, which were not included in the evaluation. While this study did not provide sensitivity and specificity scores for an MCI participant group, they noted that 70% were misclassified as either demented or cognitively normal. Earlier research by Quiroga and colleagues44 using a smaller sample (n = 100) observed 89.2% sensitivity and 70.7% specificity detecting dementia among Chilean older adults. Quiroga et al did not provide sensitivity/specificity scores by education level but noted that schooling impacted participants’ scores and suggested that a cutoff of 5/6 best balanced the impact of education. A Spanish study with a similar sample size (n = 131) produced significantly higher results: 93.3% sensitivity and 90% specificity at a cutoff of 5 and did not discuss the influence of education level on results.104

Additional Cognitive Screeners

Thirteen additional cognitive screeners met criteria for this scoping review, but because minimal data on each was identified, results have been included here.

The 12-item Boston Naming Test, a shortened version of the Boston Naming Test, yielded 85% sensitivity and 94% specificity discriminating dementia from cognitively normal participants (n = 103).105 Similarly, Ferrero-Arias et al106 evaluated the “Five by Five” test with Spanish participants (n = 196) and yielded 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity detecting cognitive impairment at a cutoff score of 19/20. The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test with Immediate Recall appeared less effective, yielding only 70% sensitivity with US-based Latinos.18 The clock drawing test, separated out from the MMSE, resulted in 99.0% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity at a cutoff of 7 when differentiating participants diagnosed with dementia from cognitively intact participants in a Peruvian study (n = 210) by Custodio and colleagues,107 but only 77% sensitivity and 80% specificity at 5/6 among cognitively impaired and cognitively normal participant groups in a larger (n = 581) Spanish study by Carnero-Pardo et al.67 The Memory, Fluency and Orientation screener fared better when identifying MCI among Chileans (n = 214; 83% sensitivity and 75% specificity at 8/9) but was less effective than other screeners at identifying participants with dementia (86% sensitivity and 96% specificity at 6/7).108 The Temporal Orientation screener was also evaluated using both MCI and dementia groups and yielded 96.6% sensitivity and 68% specificity to detecting dementia and 72% sensitivity and 92% specificity to detecting MCI.109 The Everyday Cognition Scale (E-Cog) produced stronger results with an Argentinian sample identifying MCI at 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity.110 Dementia outcomes were even higher at 99% and 82%.110

A study by Roman et al111 assessed the effectiveness of the Memory Binding Test with MCI and cognitively intact samples in Argentina (n = 88) and observed 69% sensitivity and 88% specificity. Alternately, the M@T yielded 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity detecting cognitive impairment in a Spanish sample (n = 89).112 Mejia and colleagues103 compared the effectiveness of the MMSE and 3 other brief cognitive screeners with a large Mexican sample (n = 314): The Short Blessed Test (SBT), the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS), and the PFAQ. The SBT outperformed the other brief measures at detecting cognitive impairment (based on neurological evaluation outcomes) yielding 100% sensitivity and 76% specificity with illiterate groups, 91% sensitivity and 96% specificity with participants who had 1 to 4 years of education, and 93% sensitivity and 99% specificity with participants who had 5 to 9 years of education. The BDS performed adequately with illiterate participants (82% sensitivity and 84% specificity), but reductions in sensitivity were observed with low education participants (1-4 years): the BDS yielded 65% sensitivity, even while specificity remained high. Jiménez et al113 recently evaluate the abbreviated MMSE with a small (n = 54) Chilean sample of cognitively normal and demented participants observed 30.8% sensitivity and 90.2% specificity. The Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale was also evaluated recently with a Spanish sample (n = 97) and yielded 94.3% sensitivity and 72.6% specificity identifying participants with dementia.114

Discussion

This study identified 26 cognitive screeners in total that have been adapted to or developed in Spanish language settings and met criteria for inclusion. The majority were patient performance measures, but 3 informant report measures were identified and included in the review. Thirteen screeners were reviewed at length, but a larger than the expected range of measures emerged. Most notably, the results of this scoping review suggest that the MMSE, a commonly used screener with the largest evaluative literature, appears to be neither the most accurate nor the most efficient cognitive screener. Assessment of the MMSE in Spanish consistently found education and age biases that result in reduced sensitivity and specificity among low education individuals. Mini-Mental Status Examination studies observed lower specificity overall and lower effectiveness at detecting MCI. Detection of dementia improved with the use of age and education corrections in 2 studies, but no Spanish language studies were located that applied corrections to MCI. The MoCA, which was developed, in part, to increase detection of MCI, exhibited greater MCI sensitivity and specificity, but researchers frequently found that it, too, is sensitive to education level.

The 7-Minute Screen, completed in less than half the time of the MMSE and MoCA, appears promising at detecting dementia, but empirical research is limited, and there is some evidence that indicates it may not be a useful tool for detecting MCI. Only 1 study included participants diagnosed with MCI and resulted in 28% sensitivity. The Mini-Cog, one of the briefest cognitive screeners, requires additional empirical research in Spanish. No studies have included MCI participant groups, and current research exhibited mixed results on the impact of education on outcomes. Alternately, the MIS appears to consistently produce adequate results with both dementia and cognitive impairment groups, but other screeners have produced higher sensitivity and specificity. Fuld Object Memory Evaluation produced consistent and good results detecting dementia but exhibited reduced sensitivity and specificity at detecting MCI. Versions of the ACE produced consistently high sensitivity and specificity detecting dementia and promising results among MCI participants, but there is some evidence that ACE is also affected by education level, although results have been mixed. Test Your Memory has the benefit of being self-administered, but outcomes were found to be impacted by education level, and other screeners had higher sensitivity and specificity. The Phototest and Money Tests, both initially developed in Spanish, exhibited no educational bias and are very brief. Interestingly, sensitivity and specificity rates were higher among Latin American samples than European (Spanish) samples. Most Phototest research was completed by its creator, and thus further replication is warranted. Three informant report measures were identified: the AD8, IQCODE, and PFAQ. All produced both adequate and good sensitivity/specificity outcomes when detecting dementia in Spanish, but results from studies that included MCI participant groups (one evaluated the AD8, another assessed the PFAQ) produced poor results, which suggest that MCI is currently better detected with patient performance measures, such as the Phototest. While the majority of the cognitive screeners reviewed in 3 or more studies exhibited an education bias, only 3 (MMSE, MoCA, and TYM) provided education-based adjustments for the scoring process. Others (ACEIII and FAQ) have suggested different cutoff scores for low-education individuals.

Thirteen additional screeners appear in the literature in a very limited form. Initial outcomes are reported above, but replication is necessary before further evaluation is possible. Like the 13 that appear in the literature most frequently, these brief screeners vary in length, sample location, and outcomes and frequently do not include MCI participant groups to allow differentiation in sensitivity and specificity results. Two appear early in the literature, while the majority have been evaluated in the past 10 years. The E-Cog and SBT appeared to outperform other cognitive screeners. The SBT has the advantage of maintaining accuracy regardless of education level when detecting dementia. Among illiterate participants, it yielded 100% sensitivity and 76% specificity, while low education and low-moderate education groups resulted in similarly high sensitivity and improved specificity (91% sensitivity/96% specificity and 93% sensitivity/99% specificity, respectively), which is highly promising given the variation in effectiveness observed in the MMSE and other more common screeners. The E-Cog included an MCI group which exhibited the strongest results of all cognitive screeners by balancing sensitivity and specificity at 90% and 80%.

This scoping review documents that a range of cognitive screeners have been evaluated in Spanish-speaking countries in both Europe and Latin America. While it remains a considerably smaller body of research compared to English language screeners, existing research suggests that translation and application of screeners into Spanish language contexts is nuanced and varies within Spanish-speaking countries. Different sensitivity and specificity outcomes and cutoffs were observed when the same cognitive screener was evaluated in different countries. Research methodology may influence results to some extent, but it seems likely that nation-specific cultural differences play a role, as neuropsychological test performance has been shown to vary based on culture.115 This would underline the need for cognitive screeners to be validated in individual countries regardless of shared language. Replication of results in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru are necessary to confirm findings, and new studies evaluating and norming cognitive screeners with other Latin American and Caribbean populations are necessary. Based on the evidence included this scoping review, however, the Money Test and the Phototest exhibited the least variability in sensitivity and specificity outcomes across sample locations and were not influenced by education level. Thus, they may be considered the most generalizable at this time.

This scoping review also sought to evaluate the state of the science at detecting cognitive impairment at early/mild stages, as well as more advanced stages of cognitive decline. While multiple cognitive screeners in Spanish yielded high levels of sensitivity and specificity at detecting dementia, fewer studies included MCI participant groups. For those studies that did, sensitivity and specificity were nearly always lower among MCI groups than dementia groups. Phototest, at 85.25% sensitivity/90% specificity90 and TYM, at 86% sensitivity and 88% specificity,36 produced the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. In practice, primary care and memory clinic staff are likely to see patients with various degrees and forms of cognitive impairment, so researchers are encouraged to avoid dichotomous dementia versus no dementia-participant groupings in future research and to enhance existing or develop new brief screeners that are able to identify MCI at the same rate as dementia.

Limitations

Several limitations to this scoping review were identified. Six databases (Biosis, Embase, CINAHL, EBSCOhost, Medline (Web of Science), and PsycINFO) were searched and 26 Spanish language cognitive screeners that met criteria for inclusion were identified, but it is possible that including additional databases might have revealed other screeners or additional validation articles for those already identified. One article evaluating brief cognitive screeners with a Puerto Rican sample was unable to be obtained116 and may have provided additional data. This review sought to evaluate available cognitive screeners based on sensitivity and specificity outcomes and did not assess other aspects of screener quality (internal consistency, ROC/AUC, etc). Additionally, as this was a scoping review which sought “to examine the extent, range and nature of research activity”14(p21) and not a systematic review, articles were not assessed for methodological rigor.

Conclusions and Recommendations

This scoping review identified Spanish language cognitive screeners that were evaluated for sensitivity and specificity in their detection of cognitive impairment in multiple Spanish-speaking contexts. Results revealed that direct translation from English to Spanish is insufficient, as outcomes (sensitivity, specificity, and cutoffs) varied from country to country and often were significantly impacted by participant education level. Country-specific validation and the development of demographic norms appear necessary to identify the most effective cognitive screening tools. Due to the impact of education, it also appears advisable that clinic-level practitioners consider their patient group(s) and select cognitive screeners based on education level to enhance diagnostic effectiveness and reduce the likelihood of either false negatives or positives so that cognitive impairment is identified early. Providers servicing communities with lower education levels may wish to use the Money Test or Phototest, which were both developed to minimize education bias. The future of cognitive screening tools is likely to be increasingly digital, bringing with it enhancements in clinic efficiency through the use of tablet-based tools, and improvements in accessibility, as brief cognitive screeners become more available to the public through smart phone applications.117-120 Moreover, digital platforms have the capacity to provide screeners in a variety of languages, and increased access may drive early detection through regular monitoring across time.121 While there may be no cure yet for dementia, the quality of life for patients and their families may be enhanced through secondary prevention, which is only available if an early and accurate diagnosis has occurred.
