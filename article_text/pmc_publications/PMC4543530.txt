Since Down syndrome (DS) is associated with amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, we characterized imaging measurements of regional fibrillar Aβ burden, cerebral metabolic rate (rCMRgl), gray matter volumes (rGMVs), and age associations in 5 DS with dementia (DS/AD+), 12 DS without dementia (DS/AD-), and 9 normal controls (NCs).There were significant group differences in mean SUVRs for florbetapir with DS/AD+ having the highest, followed by DS/AD-, followed by NC. For FDG-PET, posterior cingulate rCMRgl in DS/AD+ was significantly reduced compared to DS/AD- and NC. For vMRI, hippocampal volumes were significantly reduced for the DS/AD+ compared to DS/AD- and NC. Age-related SUVR increases and rCMRgl reductions were greater in DS participants than in NCs. DS is associated with fibrillar Aβ, rCMRgl, and l rGMV alterations in the dementia stage and prior to the presence of clinical decline. This study provides a foundation for the studies needed to inform treatment and prevention in DS.


INTRODUCTION

Down Syndrome (DS) is characterized by partial to complete trisomy of chromosome 21, developmental delay, and other developmental abnormalities. DS is also associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).1 This increased AD risk is generally believed to be due to trisomy of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which resides on the distal arm of chromosome 21. Presumably, possession of an extra copy of the APP gene induces APP over-expression, accounting for the virtually universal presence of fibrillar amyloid β peptide (Aβ) neuropathology in autopsied DS patients over the age of 35.2,3

AD dementia occurs in approximately 10-25% of persons with DS in their 40s, 20-50% of those in their 50s, and 60-75% of those over the age of 60.2-4 Due especially to improvements in the treatment of DS-related cardiac anomalies, more persons with DS are living to older ages.5 Given their increased risk for AD, there is a critical and largely unmet need to characterize the clinical and biomarker changes associated with preclinical and clinical stages of AD in DS individuals.

To date, the best established brain imaging methods for preclinical and clinical evaluation of AD include positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of fibrillar Aβ burden, reductions in regional PET measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of regional and whole brain volumes. These imaging techniques have been used successfully in a small number of studies to detect and track characteristic brain alterations in DS.6-17 To our knowledge, though, no reported studies have yet characterized all three measurements in the assessment of DS patients, and only one has reported findings in DS individuals with and without AD dementia.6

The primary objective in this small cross-sectional study was to use PET measurements of fibrillar Aβ burden, PET measurements of regional CMRgl, and MRI measurements of hippocampal and regional gray matter volumes to identify age-related brain imaging alterations associated with preclinical and clinical AD dementia in individuals with DS. Clinical, functional, and neuropsychological findings provided secondary outcomes of interest. These findings could establish a cohort for longitudinal research of AD biomarker assessments in DS and help set the stage for the evaluation of interventions to treat and prevent AD dementia in this at-risk population.

METHODS

Subjects

Five DS participants with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (DS/AD+), 12 DS participants without the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (DS/AD-), and 9 normal controls (NCs) were enrolled in the study (Table 1). Participants and/or their caregivers/legal guardians provided informed consent, and the participants were studied under protocols approved by our organization's Institutional Review Board. DS/AD+ participants met DSM-IV and NIA-Alzheimer's Association diagnostic criteria for AD dementia by informant report of progressive cognitive decline with clear historical evidence of functional decline from premorbid abilities. 18 DS/AD- participants had neither evidence of progressive cognitive nor functional decline.

While the standard diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV are not modified specifically for individuals with intellectual disability, it is stated within these criteria that change from a previous level of function is required for a diagnosis. Specifically, “The cognitive deficits in Criteria A1 and A2 (memory, language, executive functioning etc) each cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning”. The study lead here is a neurologist with a large number of patients in his practice and is familiar with premorbid deficits in Down syndrome (on average). We were careful to query parents/caregivers about noted changes in their daily life, much like is emphasized in a number of dementia screeners for ID currently in development (NTG screener from the National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices- not available at the start of this study).”

The DS/AD+ and DS/AD- subjects had no history of epilepsy or seizures and their neurological exams were non-focal. NC participants were cognitively normal, without trisomy 21, and matched for age to the DS/AD- group. All DS subjects were confirmed by chromosome testing to have trisomy 21. Exclusion criteria included a lifetime history of another neurodegenerative disease, vascular dementia, or psychiatric disorders. Except as noted below, a medical history, physical exam, clinical evaluation, functional and neuropsychological testing, chromosome testing, and brain imaging were performed in all subjects. One DS/AD- participant withdrew consent after florbetapir PET scan and was not subsequently assessed by MRI. An additional DS/AD+ subject, who was severely impaired and agitated during imaging procedures, was excluded from the study due to extremely poor PET and MRI imaging quality. All other participants were evaluated with both florbetapir PET and MRI.

Clinical, Functional and Neuropsychological Tests

All participants completed the Dementia Questionnaire for People with Learning Disabilities (DLD),19 the mini-mental state exam (MMSE),20 the Brief Praxis Test,21 the severe impairment battery (SIB),22 and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, Second edition (see Table 1).23 Premorbid IQ estimation was not available from records, nor was it assessed as part of the study.

[18F] Florbetapir PET acquisition and pre-processing

Florbetapir PET imaging was used to assess mean cortical-to-pontine florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) as the primary outcome measure of fibrillar Aβ burden. As in our previous florbetapir study, 7 participants underwent a 10 minute emission scan 50 minutes after intravenous injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of [18F] florbetapir. Scans were performed on a Siemens Biograph XVI HiRez PET/CT scanner. The images were reconstructed using an iterative reconstruction algorithm (4 iterations, 16 subsets), with a 5 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian filter, and were corrected for radiation attenuation and scatter. If significant patient motion was observed, another 10-minute scan was acquired. SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) was used to linearly and nonlinearly deform each subject's florbetapir PET image into Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard coordinate space with cubic voxel size of 2x2x2 mm and to smooth with 5mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel.

Mean cortical-to-pontine SUVRs were computed using measurements from a pontine region of interest (ROI) using six automatically defined bilateral (frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate [PC], and precuneus) ROIs. Due to increased cerebellar uptake in the clinical stages of autosomal dominant AD24, another form of AD that, like DS, is associated with genetically-driven increases in Aβ production, pons was employed as the reference region. SUVRs were typically less than 1.0 due to the relatively high non-specific binding in pons. In post-hoc analyses, SUVRs were characterized in each of the six cortical, thalamic, and striatum ROIs, and patterns of SUVR increases were characterized using the automated brain mapping routine in SPM8.

[18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET acquisition and pre-processing

FDG PET was used to compare regional cerebral glucose metabolism across groups. Because reduced PC CMRgl is a relatively early indicator of AD in patients affected by and at risk for late-onset and autosomal dominant AD dementia,25 data from an automatically defined PC ROI were used as the primary rCMRgl outcome measure. Please note the CMRgl (or rCMRgl) we referred to in this study was a unit-less semi-quantitative ratio of the PET counts from target region such as PC ROI over the counts from the whole brain. In this our rCMRgl is SUVR with whole brain as the reference region. Six 5-minute emission frames were acquired on the same PET/CT system 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of 5 mCi of [18F] FDG. FDG PET images were reconstructed, filtered, and corrected for radiation attenuation and scatter using the same procedures employed for reconstruction of florbetapir PET images. The six emission frames were aligned and averaged. As with the florbetapir data, SPM8 was used to linearly and nonlinearly deform each subject's averaged FDG PET image into MNI standard coordinate space, to normalize individual images for the variation in whole brain PET counts using proportionate scaling (i.e., our unit-less CMRgl or SUVR) and to smooth with 5mm full-width-at-half-maximum Gaussian kernel. In post hoc analyses, rCMRgl patterns were compared using the automated brain mapping routine in SPM826.

MRI data acquisition and pre-processing

FreeSurfer estimated hippocampal volume (relative to intracranial volume, a unit-less measure) was the primary MRI outcome measure. MRI was performed using a 1.5-T Signa system (General Electric) and a T1-weighted volumetric pulse sequence (IRSPGR; repetition time = 33 ms; echo time = 5 ms; α = 30°; number of excitations = 1; field of view = 24 cm; 256 X 192 imaging matrix; slice thickness = 1.5 mm; 124 slices; scan time = 13:36 minutes). A T2 weighted FLAIR image was used to exclude the presence of strokes and edema and a long TE gradient echo acquisition was used for the assessment of microhemorrhages.

Hippocampal-to- intracranial volume ratios were characterized from bilateral ROIs in each participant's T1-weighted MRI using the FreeSurfer 5.1 software package (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu)27-29. All images were visually inspected to verify ROI characterization.

Voxel-wise measurements of regional gray matter volume (rGMV, corrected for total intracranial volume) were determined using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) routine and DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponential Lie Algebra) protocol in SPM8.30-32. The gray matter partitions generated by this process in the MNI template space preserve the total amount of tissue from the native space images. This preservation is via voxelby-voxel multiplication of the determinant of the Jacobian matrix for the non-linear deformation only The gray matter map for each subject was smoothed with an 8mm full-width-at-half- maximum Gaussian kernel. In post-hoc analyses, rGMV patterns were compared using the automated brain mapping routine in SPM8.

Statistical analysis

To compare DS/AD+, DS/AD-, and NC groups, we assessed primary (florbetapir PET, FDG PET, and volumetric MRI) and secondary (clinical exam and functional and neuropsychological testing) outcomes using one-way ANOVAs. Where dictated by a priori hypotheses, significant outcomes were additionally assessed by between-group t-tests. Each primary outcome measure also was evaluated for its association with age. Here, DS groups were pooled to provide a more complete span of ages, and a general linear model was employed to determine whether or not the slope for a particular variable (plotted against age) deviated significantly from zero. Age-related differences between the DS group as a whole and the NC group were evaluated by comparing the age-associated slopes age by group interaction for each variable between groups, the same way as applied in a previous study.33 Alpha ≤ 0.05 was used for all primary measures. For the post-hoc brain mapping analyses, P ≤ 0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons, was employed to provide information about the pattern of between-group differences in each brain imaging measurement. Summary data are given throughout as mean ± standard deviation.

RESULTS

Participants’ demographic characteristics and clinical, functional, and neuropsychological test scores are shown in Table 1. The AD/DS+ group was significantly older than the DS/AD-and NC groups. As predicted, the DS groups performed significantly less well than the NC group, and the DS/AD+ group performed significantly less well than the DS/AD- group, on most of the clinical and neuropsychological tests.

Figure 1a shows comparisons on the three primary outcome measures. There were significant group differences in mean cortical-to-pontine SUVRs, with DS/AD+ (1.14 ± 0.13) followed by DS/AD- (0.94 ± 0.07) followed by NC (0.80 ± 0.03) (linear trend ANOVA P &lt; 1.0e-6). PC-to-whole brain CMRgl also differed significantly between the groups, with DS/AD+ (1.32 ± 0.20), DS/AD- (1.54 ± 0.18), and NC (1.76 ± 0.16) demonstrating the lowest-to-highest readings, respectively (linear trend ANOVA P &lt; 0.001). Hippocampal GMVs, however, did not exhibit significant group differences, with similar mean values for DS/AD+ (0.005 ± 0.0007), DS/AD- (0.0052 ± 0.0006), and NC (0.0049 ± 0.00033) (linear trend ANOVA P = 0.12). Associations between age and the increase in mean cortical SUVR and decline in PC CMRgl were significantly greater in the overall DS group than in the NC group (P = 0.015 and P = 0.011, respectively), whereas the associations between age and hippocampal GMV decline were not (P = 0.85) (Figure 1b). In post-hoc ROI analyses, there were significant between-group florbetapir SUVR differences in the frontal (P = 1e-5), temporal (P = 1e-6), parietal (P = 8e-6), anterior cingulate, (P = 1e-6), PC (P = 5e-6), precuneus (P = 2e-6), and striatum (P = 6e-6) ROIs, and a non-significant trend in the thalamic ROI (P=0.054).

The statistical brain maps in Figures 2-4 show locations with significantly greater SUVRs, lower regional CMRgl, and lower regional GMV in a) the DS/AD+ compared to NC group, b) the DS/AD+ compared to DS/AD- group, and c) the DS/AD- compared to NC group, respectively (P ≤ 0.001 in all comparisons).

The DS groups had significantly higher florbetapir SUVRs than the NC group bilaterally in the vicinity of posterior and anterior cingulate, precuneus, parietal, temporal, frontal, and striatal regions (Figures 2a, row A and C), similar to patterns in the clinical and preclinical stages of late-onset AD in published reports.24,34 These results were still apparent after controlling for age. The magnitude of increase was significantly greater in DS/AD+ (Figure 2a Row B).

The DS/AD+ group was distinguished from the DS/AD- and NC groups by significantly lower CMRgl bilaterally in the vicinity of PC, lateral parietal, and temporal and frontal regions, which have been previously shown to be preferentially affected in the clinical and preclinical stages of late-onset AD (Figures 3a row A and C)35,36. The DS/AD+ and DS/AD- groups were also distinguished from the NC group by significantly lower CMRgl in the vicinity of additional medial frontal regions.

The DS/AD+ group had significant regional gray matter reduction compared to NC (Figure 4a Row A) and to DS/AD- groups (Figure 4a Row B). The most prominent reductions were in bilateral basal, medial, and pre-frontal lobes, bilateral temporal lobes, lateral parietal cortex, and precuneus. However, lateral parietal cortex and precuneus changes in the DS/AD+ versus NC comparison became non-significant after accounting for age effects. DS/AD– subjects also had lower volumetric MRI measures than NC subjects in the medial, prefrontal, and occipital lobes (Figure 4a Row C).

The DS/AD+ group was distinguished from the DS/AD- and NC groups by significantly lower GMV bilaterally in the vicinity of PC, parietal, temporal, and frontal regions, which are preferentially affected by AD37. The DS/AD+ and DS/AD- groups were also distinguished from the NC group by significantly lower GMV in the vicinity of additional medial frontal regions, which we again postulate to reflect differences in brain development. In addition to the voxel-wise correlation with cog scores, we also examined such correlations for the primary image outcomes (AV45: mean-cortical SUVR, FDG: posterior cingulate, MRI: hippocampus volume):The correlation is significant for florbetapir SUVR, for FDG-PET CMRgl, but not for hippocampus volume.

Cognitive measures did not differ significantly between DSAD+ and DSAD-.Table 2 summarizes the correlations between cognitive measures and imaging parameters. The SIB appears to correlate better with imaging modalities than other cognitive measures.

DISCUSSION

This brain imaging study provides new information about the fibrillar Aβ, CMRgl, and GMV alterations associated with the clinical and preclinical stages of AD in participants with DS. DS subjects had florbetapir PET evidence of fibrillar Aβ burden in the symptomatic dementia stage. Further, fibrillar Aβ was detected in DS subjects without evidence of cognitive decline (DS/AD-) as early as 35 years of age (see figure 1). Increases in florbetapir uptake were associated with dementia status and older age. More specifically, florbetapir uptake strongly increases with and correlates with age. DS participants with AD dementia also had lower CMRgl and GMV in brain regions known to be preferentially affected by late-onset AD Finally, DS participants with and without dementia had lower CMRgl and GMV than NC subjects in additional frontal regions. We believe these latter alterations may reflect differences in brain development.

In this study, we used pons as the reference region for the examination of amyloid deposits measured by florbetapir. Such practice was based on its previous use in the autosomal dominant AD subjects 24. We felt that given the similarity between PS1 and DS as amyloid overproducing conditions, this methodology was appropriate to use. In addition, neuropathological studies have suggested the presence of cerebellar amyloid deposition in the clinical stages of early-onset amyloid-β (Aβ) overproducing syndromes, including autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers and patients with Down syndrome). Interestingly, our results showed the greater cerebellar SUVR in DS/AD+ than in DS/AD- or in NC group, and in DS/AD-than in NC. Rather than that, the overall amyloid pattern findings are similar using either Pons or cerebellum as the reference region.

Cognitive measures did not differ significantly between DSAD+ and DSAD-. This is likely due to smaller sample size and the possibility that the tests were not as sensitive as the neuroimaging based biomarkers. Our study was not designed to examine the difference between DSAD+/- subjects. Rather one of our focuses was to examine the earliest changes we can detect in DS subjects compared to the NC (the age trajectory of various biomarkers).

A small number of published studies have used PET to characterize fibrillar Aβ burden in persons with DS.6-9 For instance, Handen et al used Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET to study seven 20-44 year-old DS/AD- participants and found evidence of fibrillar Aβ burden in the two individuals who were at least 38 years of age.9 Landt et al used PiB PET to study five DS/AD+ participants, four DS/AD- participants, and 14 NCs and found evidence of fibrillar Aβ burden after the age of 45.6 Both PiB PET studies found preferential evidence of fibrillar Aβ deposition in the striatum, similar to that found in some PiB studies of autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers. Nelson et al used fluoroethyl-methylamino]-naphthyl-ethylidene malononitrile PET to investigate fibrillar and tau burden in 19 (mean age 36,7 years-old) DS/AD- participants and reported increased SUVRs in brain regions similar to that observed in late onset AD.8 We previously used florbetapir PET to characterize fibrillar Aβ burden in an end-of-life DS/AD+ participant7. Here, we found a regional pattern of fibrillar Aβ deposition similar to that observed in late-onset AD7. In our florbetapir PET study of PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers, we also found a regional pattern of fibrillar Aβ deposition similar to that observed in late-onset AD 24,38. We subsequently confirmed the magnitude and pattern of fibrillar Aβ deposition at autopsy7. We interpret our florbetapir PET data to preferentially affect the same brain regions that might be affected in late-onset AD. While there was a close correlation between antemortem PET and postmortem histopathological measurements of Aβ plaques in this DS participant with AD dementia, florbetapir PET measurements may be less sensitive to the detection of the primarily diffuse Aβ plaques that have been reported in virtually all DS/AD- individuals who expired by the age of 3539.Previously published FDG PET studies have reported a pattern of CMRgl reductions in DS adults with and without AD dementia similar to that observed in late-onset AD40, consistent with the findings reported in our study. In addition, Haier et al, reported increased inferior and medial temporal CMRgl11,12 in middle-aged DS/AD- participants, raising the possibility of compensatory increases in local neuronal activity in preclinical stages of AD.

While we are not aware of previously published volumetric MRI studies in DS/AD+ individuals, previously published volumetric MRI studies have reported alterations in GMV and white matter volume alterations in DS/AD- individuals and their associations with older age.14-17 For example, Teipel et al.15 found significant age-related CMV reductions in precuneus, lateral parietal, and temporal, frontal, occipital, and parahippocampal regions in these individuals. Our findings are generally consistent with the GMV findings in those reports and extend them to DS individuals with AD dementia.

In addition to progressive CMRgl and GMV reductions in brain regions known to be preferentially affected by AD, the DS/AD+ and DS/AD- groups had lower CMRgl and GMV than NCs in additional medial and basal frontal regions. Others have identified greater occipital atrophy and relative sparing of both medial and lateral temporal regions on MRI and FDG. While we cannot exclude the possibility that these changes are related to preclinical AD processes that do not continue to progress with age or to clinical severity after middle age, we postulate that these changes might reflect DS-related alterations in brain development.

Additional studies are needed to a) further characterize and confirm our fibrillar Aβ, CMRgl, and brain tissue volume findings in a larger number of participants; b) control for the effects of APOE genotypes and premormid IQs; and c) clarify the extent to which the brain imaging alterations predict subsequent clinical decline. Additional studies also are needed to track these changes over time and provide sample size estimates for the evaluation of preclinical and clinical AD treatments using these brain imaging endpoints in proof-of-concept trials. Additional studies in DS individuals also are needed to characterize the most sensitive indicators of cognitive and functional decline in the preclinical and clinical stages of AD and provide sample size estimates for the evaluation of treatments using these endpoints in license-enabling trials.

DS represents the largest population of individuals at risk for early-onset Aβ pathology, far exceeding the number of patients who carry autosomal dominant AD mutations. With the growing number of DS individuals living to older ages, there is an urgent need to find effective clinical and preclinical AD treatments in this vulnerable population. 41-44

Conclusions

DS is associated with characteristic fibrillar Aβ, regional CMRgl, and regional GMV alterations in in the symptomatic dementia stage and prior to onset of cognitive decline. Amyloid signal strongly increases with age in DS. This brain imaging study provides a foundation for the longitudinal studies needed to inform AD treatment and prevention trials in this vulnerable population.

Research in Context

Systematic review:

AD dementia occurs in approximately 10-25% of persons with DS in their 40s, 20-50% of those in their 50s, and 60-75% of those over the age of 60. Given their increased risk for AD, there is a critical and largely unmet need to characterize the clinical and biomarker changes associated with preclinical and clinical stages of AD in DS individuals. A small number of published studies have used PET to characterize fibrillar Aβ burden in persons with DS. Handen et al used Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET to study seven 20-44 year-old DS/AD- participants and found evidence of fibrillar Aβ burden in the two individuals who were at least 38 years of age. Landt et al used PiB PET to study five DS/AD+ participants, four DS/AD- participants, and 14 NCs and found evidence of fibrillar Aβ burden after the age of 45.

Interpretation:

Our brain imaging study provides new information about the fibrillar Aβ, CMRgl, and GMV alterations associated with the clinical and preclinical stages of AD in participants with DS. DS subjects had florbetapir PET evidence of fibrillar Aβ burden in the symptomatic dementia stage. Further, fibrillar Aβ was detected in DS subjects without evidence of cognitive decline (DS/AD-) as early as 35 years of age (see figure 1). Increases in florbetapir uptake were associated with dementia status and older age. More specifically, florbetapir uptake strongly increases with and correlates with age. DS participants with AD dementia also had lower CMRgl and GMV in brain regions known to be preferentially affected by late-onset AD Finally, DS participants with and without dementia had lower CMRgl and GMV than NC subjects in additional frontal regions. We believe these latter alterations may reflect differences in brain development.

Future directions:

The goal is to assess imaging characteristics in Down syndrome with and without dementia to determine when the changes occur. Do they proceed or coincide with cognitive decline? DS is associated with characteristic fibrillar Aβ, regional CMRgl, and regional GMV alterations in the symptomatic dementia stage and prior to onset of cognitive decline. Amyloid signal strongly increases with age in DS. Our brain imaging study provides a foundation for the longitudinal studies needed to inform AD treatment and prevention trials in this vulnerable population.
