Background:

Factors associated with sleep quality have not been well examined in hospitalized older persons with dementia, who are at high risk for impaired sleep. The aim was to identify factors associated with sleep quality among hospitalized persons with dementia.

Methods:

This secondary analysis used baseline data from a cluster randomized trial. Factors examined included delirium severity, pain, depression, behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), and daytime physical activity. Multiple stepwise linear regressions evaluated factors related to dimensions of sleep quality (sleep duration, efficiency, latency, and fragmentation; measured by the MotionWatch 8 (MW8)).

Results:

Increased daytime physical activity was associated with higher sleep duration (β = .164; 95% CI, .111 to .717; p = .008; 7.7% variance) and sleep efficiency (β = .158; 95% CI, .020 to .147; p = .010; 5.4% variance), and less sleep fragmentation (β = −.223; 95% CI, −.251 to −.077; p &lt; .001; 10.4% variance). Higher BPSD was significantly associated with prolonged sleep latency (β = .130; 95% CI, .098 to 2.748; p = .035; 3.7% variance).

Conclusions:

Results suggest the need to encourage daytime physical activity and reduce or manage BPSD to improve sleep quality among hospitalized persons with dementia.

pmcIntroduction

Sleep is a basic human need and is necessary for optimal health and wellbeing.1 Adequate sleep is essential for physical performance, cognitive functioning, and emotional regulation.1 Sleep is critical at any age, but sleep recommendations vary among individuals.2 The National Sleep Foundation3 recommends the general adult population including adults older than 65 years to have at least 7 or more hours of sleep per night. A recent study declared sleep insufficiency a public health epidemic as 83.6 million adults in the United States are not getting enough sleep (&lt;7 hours) on a regular basis.4 Hospitalized older persons with dementia are at increased risk of poor sleep quality.5 Sleep deprivation in the hospital is linked to negative health outcomes, such as delirium,6 cardiometabolic derangements,7 and increased falls.7 The consequences of poor sleep quality in persons with dementia include increased caregiver burden8 and hospitalizations.5

Factors Associated with Sleep Quality

Sleep quality is associated with a range of factors, including physical and mental health, psychological symptoms and behaviors, and demographic characteristics.9–11 Factors associated with poor sleep quality in older adults with dementia include increased behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), delirium, depression, pain, and lack of physical activity.6,9,12 In addition, demographic characteristics including age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education level have been associated with poor sleep quality in older adults with dementia.10,11 Other factors like any underlying medical condition (e.g., pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure), comorbidities, cognition, and medications (e.g., analgesics and bronchodilators) can also contribute to sleep disturbances.9,13 Prior work has shown that older adults with dementia may experience sleep pattern changes such as frequent and longer awakenings at night, trouble falling asleep, and decreased sleep duration.9 Persons with dementia may experience reversal of the sleep-wake cycle and experience excessive daytime sleepiness and napping as well.9

Sleep Quality in the Hospital

Sleep quality is negatively impacted in the hospital, and hospitalized patients with dementia are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances.5 Prevalence of sleep disturbances of up to 67% have been found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and sleep disturbances have been reported in up to 90% of patients with other dementias such as vascular and Lewy body dementia.14 Sleep disturbance during hospitalization increases care dependency and hinders participation in rehabilitation,15 increasing the risk of fall-related injuries, functional impairment, institutionalization, and early mortality. In the hospital setting, environmental factors, such as noise or light exposure, medical procedures such as phlebotomy, arousing patients for late evening or early morning medications, and patient-related factors such as pain may contribute to sleep disturbance.7 However, factors associated with sleep quality have not been well examined in hospitalized older persons with dementia, who are at high risk for impaired sleep. Thus, this study aimed to identify factors associated with sleep quality among hospitalized persons with dementia. It was hypothesized that delirium severity, pain, depression, BPSD, and daytime physical activity would be associated with sleep quality (sleep duration, efficiency, latency, and fragmentation) among hospitalized persons with dementia. Findings from this study will identify factors that will help optimize sleep quality in this population.

Methods

Design

This study was a secondary analysis using baseline data of a cluster randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of Fam-FFC (Family-centered Function-focused Care); a family-nurse partnership focused on improving functional outcomes related to hospitalization.16 The purpose of the Fam-FFC model is to improve: (1) the physical and cognitive recovery in hospitalized persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) during hospitalization and the 60-day post-acute period; and (2) family caregiver preparedness and experiences. The Fam-FFC intervention incorporates environmental policy assessment, staff education/training, unit-based champions, and individualized goal setting to support functional recovery of the person with ADRD. The study was registered in clinicaltrials.gov: identifier number NCT03046121. Data was collected between November 2017 through December 2019. The University Institutional Review Board approved study procedures, and all patients provided written informed consent before data collection.

Setting and Sample

Patients were recruited from six medical units in three Pennsylvania hospitals (two units per hospital), varying in size, educational composition, and staffing. Patients were eligible to participate if they were: (1) aged 65 years or older; (2) spoke English or Spanish; (3) community-dwelling prior to admission to hospital; (4) had a family caregiver as the designated study partner for study duration; (5) screened positive for dementia based on a score of ≤ 25 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)17 and a score of ≥ 2 on the AD8 Dementia Screening Interview18; (6) diagnosis of very mild to moderate stage dementia confirmed by a score of 0.5 to 2.0 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR)19; (7) indicated impaired function based on a ≥ 9 on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).20 Exclusion criteria included: (1) admitted from a nursing home; (2) enrolled in Hospice; (3) no family caregiver to participate; (4) significant neurological condition associated with cognition other than dementia (e.g., brain tumor); (5) major acute psychiatric disorder.

Procedures

Following consent and eligibility, trained research evaluators blinded to the study, collected data through electronic medical chart review, observation, or interview of the family caregiver. Upon enrollment, eligible patients had a MotionWatch 8 (MW8) applied.21 The MW8 is a lightweight, waterproof device containing a miniature accelerometer. The patients wore the MW8 consecutively over one-time period on their non-dominant wrist.22 It was intended for the patient to wear the MW8 for at least 24 hours prior to removal. Valid MW8 data included patients with at least 10 hours of wear time over a 24-hour period.23 Baseline data collection, including placement of the MW8 was conducted within 48 hours of admission and prior to the Fam-FFC intervention.

Measures

Descriptive data included age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, length of hospital stay (counting admission and discharge date), comorbidities, and cognition. Comorbidity was evaluated using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).24 Cognition was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).17 The MoCA is a cognitive screening tool used to evaluate executive function, orientation, memory, abstract thinking, and attention. In the current study, the MoCA demonstrated 99% inter-rater reliability agreement (in paired assessments) by trained research evaluators. Using the original cutoff score of &lt; 26, the MoCA demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 87% to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 87% to detect Alzheimer’s dementia (AD)17 The reliability and validity of the MoCA have been established in culturally diverse populations.25

Delirium Severity

Delirium severity was measured using the Confusion Assessment Method Short Form (CAM-S),26 a 4-item questionnaire. The first item, acute onset and fluctuating course is scored as no (0) or yes (1). The second and third items, inattention, and disorganized thinking respectively, are each scored as absent (0), present in mild form (1), or present in severe form (2). The fourth item, altered level of consciousness, is scored as alert or normal (0), vigilant or lethargic (1), and stupor or coma (2). The total score is an additive score of each item, with scores ranging from 0–7; higher scores indicate greater severity of delirium. Prior research provided evidence of 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for the CAM-S.27

Depression

Depression was assessed using The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD),28 a 19-item instrument that measures five domains including mood-related signs, behavioral disturbances, cyclic functions, and ideational disturbance. Each domain includes subdomains rated as 0 (absent), 1 (mild) and 2 (severe). The total score is the sum of the subdomains, with scores ranging between 0 to 38. Higher scores denote more depressive symptoms, and a score ≥ 6 is an indicator of depression. The CSDD has demonstrated good psychometric properties; interrater reliability (κ = .67), internal consistency (α = 0.84), and concurrent validity (r = 0.83).28

Pain

Pain was evaluated using the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD),29 a 5-item tool that measures behaviors including breathing, negative vocalization, facial expression, body language, and the ability to be consoled. Each item is scored from 0 to 2 based on pain intensity, and total scores range from 0 to 10. A total score of 0 indicates no pain, while a total score of 10 represents maximum possible pain. The PAINAD has acceptable reliability and validity.29

Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia

Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) were assessed using the Brief Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q).30 It is a 12-item questionnaire, evaluating 12 domains of BPSD: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria/depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disturbances, and appetite and eating disturbances. The severity subscale was used in this study. To evaluate severity for each domain, a 3-point scale is used: 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe. Total NPI severity scores can range from 0–36, and higher scores reflect greater BPSD severity. The validity and reliability of the NPI-Q has been well established.30

Daytime Physical Activity

Daytime physical activity was objectively measured with the MW8. Data were collected at a sampling rate of 50 Hz and aggregated into 1-minute epochs. The data were analyzed by the MW8 software, and activity counts (number of times the waveform crosses 0 for each period being evaluated) was the unit of measurement. Consistent with prior literature, daytime physical activity period was defined between 7am-11pm.31 The MW8 has evidence of validity and reliability in older adults with dementia in hospitalized settings.32

Outcome Measures

The MW8 software was used to derive objective measurements of sleep quality (sleep duration, efficiency, latency, and fragmentation). Sleep duration is the total time spent asleep. Sleep efficiency is the percentage of total time asleep to time in bed. Sleep latency is the amount of time between going to bed (‘lights out’) and falling asleep. Sleep fragmentation is expressed as a percentage of the total number of awakenings during the sleep (sum of ‘mobile time (%)’ and the ‘immobile hours ≤ 1 min (%)’). Based on previous sleep reference levels for older adults, poor sleep quality was defined as sleep duration ≤ 360 min, efficiency ≤ 75, latency &gt; 30, and fragmentation ≥ 40.33,34 The sleep period was between 11pm and 7am.35

Data Analysis

SPSS (version 25; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) was used for all data analyses. Descriptive statistics of patient characteristics were presented using frequencies, percentages, means and standard deviations. Data were checked for normality (e.g., skewness, kurtosis, and outliers) before the analysis. Univariate analyses were conducted to assess associations between study variables. Variables that were statistically significant in the univariate analyses were included in the stepwise regression. Multiple stepwise linear regressions were used to investigate potential predictors associated with each sleep quality outcome (duration, efficiency, latency, and fragmentation). F-entry criterion p = 0.05 and F-removal criterion p = 0.10 were used in the stepwise regressions. The control variables including age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, cognition, and comorbidities were entered in the model first, followed by the predictor variables including delirium severity, pain, depression, BPSD, and daytime physical activity. Associations between study variables were tested, and the coefficients were below 0.90. Multicollinearity was not a problem; tolerance was greater than 0.10 and a variance inflation factor was less than 10. In all analyses, statistical significance was defined as p &lt; 0.05.

Results

Table 1 presents the descriptive characteristics. The 259 patients had a mean age of 81.36 (SD = 8.24) and significant cognitive impairment (mean MoCA score = 10.73, SD = 6.94). The majority of the patients were female (60.2%), non-Hispanic Black (47.9%) or non-Hispanic White (49.8%), married (32.4%), and high school graduates (40.9%). On average, the CCI score was 3.83 (SD = 2.42) and length of hospital stay was 6.43 days (SD = 3.00). Most patients had low levels of delirium severity (mean CAM-S score = 1.37, SD = 1.68), slight BPSD (mean NPI-Q score = 8.82, SD = 6.08), no pain (mean PAINAD score = .72, SD = 1.41), and depression (mean CSDD score = 9.92, SD = 6.35). Daytime physical activity counts were 36.93 (SD = 42.69).

Table 2 describes the patients’ sleep quality characteristics. The patients indicated poor sleep quality with short sleep duration (312.76 min, SD = 107.92), low sleep efficiency (65.05%), prolonged sleep latency (38.12 min, SD = 66.46), and high sleep fragmentation (58.33%).

As shown in Table 3, the univariate analyses found that physical activity was significantly associated with sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation. BPSD was significantly associated with sleep latency. After controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, cognition, and comorbidities, the multiple stepwise linear regressions revealed that higher daytime physical activity was associated with higher sleep duration (β = .164; 95% CI, .111 to .717; p = .008; 7.7% variance) and sleep efficiency (β = .158; 95% CI, .020 to .147; p = .010; 5.4% variance), and less sleep fragmentation (β = −.223; 95% CI, −.251 to −.077; p &lt; .001; 10.4% variance). Higher BPSD was significantly associated with prolonged sleep latency (β = .130; 95% CI, .098 to 2.748; p = .035; 3.7% variance).

Discussion

This study identified factors associated with sleep quality among hospitalized persons with dementia. The majority of the patients had evidence of poor sleep quality which is consistent with prior research conducted in the hospital environment.7 The findings partially supported our hypothesis that delirium severity, pain, depression, BPSD and daytime physical activity would be associated with objective measures of sleep quality (sleep duration, efficiency, latency, and fragmentation) among hospitalized persons with dementia. We found that higher levels of daytime physical activity were significantly associated with increased sleep duration, improved sleep efficiency, and decreased sleep fragmentation, but not sleep latency in hospitalized older persons with dementia. These results are consistent with other work where higher physical activity was associated with better sleep quality characteristics in non-acute care settings.12 Our findings offer a signal, suggesting the relationship between daytime physical activity and sleep can improve sleep disturbance in hospitalized persons with dementia. In this study, the variance of physical activity only accounted for 7.7%, 5.4%, and 10.4% on sleep duration, efficiency, and fragmentation models respectively. Thus, further research is warranted to explore other factors such as mental health issues (e.g., depression), medical acuity, and type of diagnosis that may influence daytime physical activity and sleep quality. In addition, the association between daytime physical activity and sleep latency was not significant which may be explained by the lower patterns of physical activity demonstrated by older adults with dementia when hospitalized.32 Future research is recommended to examine the associations of daytime physical activity, including the type and intensity of physical activity and sleep quality in diverse hospitalized persons with dementia.

We also found that greater BPSD severity was significantly associated with prolonged sleep latency. This finding is consistent with prior studies, suggesting that BPSD have strong associations with sleep quality, including longer sleep latency.36 Our results show that better management of BPSD might improve sleep disturbances in hospitalized older adults with dementia. BPSD accounted for only 3.7% variance on the model which suggests that other variables such as use of medications, negative interpersonal interactions, and environmental factors (e.g., noise and light levels) that could be associated with BPSD should be examined in future work. Future studies should further extend this work by examining types of BPSD and sleep quality.

In contrast to other studies that found delirium severity, pain, and depression associated with poor sleep quality in the hospital setting,6,37,38 we found no significant associations between these symptoms and sleep quality, which could be due to the low levels of delirium severity, pain, and depression found in our sample. Since majority of our sample had minor depression, it could mean that higher levels of depression may be associated with poor sleep quality in hospitalized persons with dementia. Also, our study did not assess factors such as medications or specific sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia) which have been found to be associated with depression.39 Future studies should continue to explore the contribution of these factors when examining factors associated with sleep quality.

Limitations

This secondary analysis was based on a population that only included patients from one state and three hospitals, which limits the generalizability of this study. Additionally, only medical patients with mild to moderate dementia were included. The study also did not examine other potentially salient variables including medical acuity/type of diagnoses, types of medications, active medical conditions, mental health issues, and environmental factors. We did not directly measure self-reported or informant-reported sleep quality but rather used objective measures of sleep characteristics (latency, fragmentation, efficiency, duration). Future studies could include a measure such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index40 to capture subjective aspects. Lastly, other common sleep disorders such as insomnia, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder that could disturb sleep quality in persons with dementia were not assessed.13 Thus, future studies are needed to more comprehensively assess the factors related to sleep quality in hospitalized persons with dementia

Conclusions

Despite these limitations, the current study identified daytime physical activity and BPSD as key factors to optimize sleep quality in hospitalized older adults with dementia. Our findings showed that daytime physical activity may improve sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation, but not sleep latency in hospitalized older persons with dementia. Additionally, greater BPSD severity may prolong sleep latency. The results suggest the need to encourage daytime physical activity and reduce and manage BPSD to improve sleep quality among hospitalized persons with dementia. Future research is warranted to examine associations of daytime physical activity, BPSD, and sleep quality in persons with varying medical acuity and diagnoses in diverse settings.
