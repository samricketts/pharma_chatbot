Access to cognitive stimulation through social interactions is a key mechanism used to explain the association between personal networks, cognitive health, and brain structure in older adults. However, little research has assessed how best to operationalize access to novel or diverse social stimuli using social network measures, many of which were designed to study information diffusion within large whole networks (e.g., structural holes and bridging social capital). Using data from 277 adults in the Social Networks and Alzheimer Disease (SNAD) study, we aimed to evaluate such measures for use in research on cognitive aging using personal social networks. We found a positive association between individual measures of structural holes and cognitive health, but not with brain structure. Further, we extracted a latent measure of bridging social capital using multiple individual measures (i.e., structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size) and found it was significantly associated with cognitive health and brain structure, supporting the utility of this concept and related measures in the study of cognitive aging. Finally, individual measures may underestimate the effects of multidimensional bridging social capital on cognitive health and brain structure compared to a latent measure that combines them.

Alzheimer’s Disease

pmcGiven the rising age of the global population, cognitive impairment and dementia are an increasingly important determinant of financial burden and quality of life in families of older adults (Prince et al. 2015). Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for cognitive impairment nor dementia (Alzheimer’s Association 2019). Although the consequences of dementia are widespread (Alzheimer’s Association 2019), numerous clinical studies have demonstrated that certain older adults manage to remain cognitively healthy despite experiencing significant brain atrophy (Mortimer et al. 2003; Wharton et al. 2011). This heterogeneity in people’s response to brain atrophy suggests that neuropathology alone does not invariably cause dementia. Indeed, recent findings within the neuroscientific literature suggest that external factors, such as the social environment, likely play an important role in the etiology of dementia phenotypes. Therefore, cognitive aging researchers have been prioritizing investigation of cognitively stimulating environments that can prevent or slow the process of cognitive decline and brain atrophy at the early/preclinical stage (Kelly et al. 2017; Molesworth et al. 2015).

One mechanism proposed in this line of research is that exposure to novel and diverse social stimuli through social relationships bolsters cognitive health and brain structure (Molesworth et al. 2015; Perry et al. 2021). A concept from the social sciences – bridging social capital – aptly characterizes the kinds of networks that are thought to provide beneficial exposures (Burt 2009; Granovetter 1973; Lin and Peek 1999). Bridging social capital is defined as social resources embedded within a loosely connected social network composed of weaker ties to dissimilar others. From a social network perspective, sharing ties to a loosely connected groups of dissimilar others is likely to expose individuals to novel, non-redundant information and experiences (Granovetter 1973; Perry et al. 2018). In addition, because dissimilar others usually hold different social norms and information, maintaining ties to dissimilar others requires an individual to switch between different cognitive frameworks associated with distinct social groups (Mische and White 1998). Therefore, bridging social capital should theoretically bolster cognitive health and brain structure by promoting access to cognitively stimulating social environments (Ali et al. 2018; Chapko et al. 2018). In contrast, closely connected network members (e.g., close friends and family members) tend to share similar information and perspectives, and therefore are less likely to foster cognitively stimulating social experiences.

However, given that traditional measures of bridging social capital, such as structural holes (an “empty space” between contacts in a person's network who do not interact), were developed primarily for the study of large, whole networks (Burt 2009), it is unclear whether extracting these measures from older adults’ personal networks, which tend to be small and dense, is valuable. Finally, these measures were also designed largely to study information diffusion and access to novel information or resources in research on corporate environments, so it is unclear whether they will be useful for operationalizing access to novel and diverse social stimuli among older adults. To address these gaps, this study has two aims: (1) examine the association between bridging social capital and cognitive health and brain structure; (2) investigate and compare different measures of bridging social capital in the study of older adults’ personal networks.

Background

Bridging social capital in this study is assessed using an egocentric network approach (Perry et al. 2018) rather than a whole network approach. An egocentric network (i.e., personal network) refers to a focal individual (ego) and his/her ties to a defined set of other people (alters). Each ego’s personal network differs with respect to types of connections to alters, characteristics of alters, and patterns of connections between alters. Differences in network structure, strength, and composition, in turn, have important health consequences for individuals across the life course (Ali et al. 2018; Goldman and Cornwell 2015; Pan and Chee 2020).

Structural Holes, Cognitive Health, and Brain Structure

A classic measure of bridging social capital is Ron Burt’s structural holes (Burt 2009). A structural hole refers to an “empty space” between contacts in a person's network who do not interact. The presence of structural holes within one’s personal network indicates opportunities for access to diverse sets of information (Goldman and Cornwell 2015). However, little attention has been paid to the association between structural holes and cognitive health and brain structure. One study found that poor cognitive function prevents people from maintaining structural holes (Cornwell 2009a). There are two possible reasons why relative little research has applied the concept of bridging social capital to the case of older adults’ cognitive decline.

First, structural holes were primarily developed for studying diffusion of information and innovation in large and complete networks (Ahuja 2000; Burt 2004; Gargiulo and Benassi 2000). Therefore, it is unclear whether such a measure is suited to study the small personal networks of older adults. Indeed, socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen 1992) suggests that people become increasingly oriented to strong and emotionally rewarding relationships as they age, which leads to the loss of weak (especially non-kin) ties. Consistent with this prediction, empirical studies have found that the personal networks of older adults are smaller and more homogeneous than their younger counterparts (Cornwell et al. 2008; Shaw et al. 2007). Although there is appreciable network heterogeneity across the older population (Roth 2020), on average these more restricted network characteristics may reduce the predictive power of measures of structural holes for this population. Second, identification of structural holes requires information about alter-alter ties to map the structure of a network and thus is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, most research on social connectedness and cognition employs proxy measures that are less resource intensive to collect. In this paper, we examine the possibility that structural holes are associated with better cognitive function and brain structure in the aging population.

Towards a Latent Measure of Bridging Social Capital

Cognitive aging scholars often rely on simple network measures instead of indicators of social network structure (e.g., structural holes) to assess bridging social capital. For example, network size is one of the most frequently used network measures to predict cognitive health and brain structure, and it is sometimes treated as a convenient proxy measure of bridging social capital (Ellwardt et al. 2015; Kelly et al. 2017; Kwak et al. 2018). Conceptually, larger networks are more likely to provide bridging social capital as there is more chance that alters do not know one another within the network. Indeed, network size has been shown to increase bridging social capital and exposure to novel and diverse experiences and social activities (Cornwell 2009b; Kelly et al. 2017; Wilson 2000). A principal reason for the popularity of network size is that it tends to be a more convenient measure relative to other types of network data. Studies thus often rely on global measures such as friend counts and network size as proxies for social engagement (Holtzman et al. 2004; Kelly et al. 2017). Given the popularity of network size and its theoretical link to bridging social capital, we consider network size as a measure of bridging social capital.

Network diversity, a measure of the total number of relationship types in a network (Cohen et al. 1997), has also been used as a measure of exposure to diverse social environments. Studies using this measure have found that those who have more diversified social networks (i.e., those who interact with a combination of family members, friends, neighbors, and colleagues) have better cognitive health (Ali et al. 2018; Ellwardt et al. 2015) and brain structure (Molesworth et al. 2015) than their counterparts with fewer types of social relationships.

Measures of weak ties, meanwhile, rely on ego-alter tie characteristics such as infrequent contact or low tie strength. According to the theory of weak ties (Granovetter 1973), a key advantage of weak ties is access to novel information, resources, and social environments that are often unavailable within strong ties. Tie strength, therefore, is closely linked to the concept of bridging social capital. Many studies have documented that weak ties promote access to novel ideas and knowledge about social activities, opportunities, stress, or health problems, and thus provide individuals with more diverse informational support (Barak et al. 2008; Granovetter 1977; Wright and Miller 2010). Weak ties also expose individuals to diverse social interactions and life experiences that are likely to stimulate the mobilization of cognitive capacities (Berkman and Glass 2000). Indeed, one study found that weak ties were related to better cognitive function (Pan and Chee 2020). However, the link between weak ties and brain structure is unclear.

Although measures of structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size all share a theoretical underpinning – capturing access to novel/diverse information, resources, and environments – each measure only represents one dimension of bridging social capital. Thus, reliance on a single measure results in discarded information and may fail to completely capture the theoretical nature of bridging social capital. Consequently, these measures operationalize only a portion of the theoretical concept, and may underestimate the magnitude of the relationship between bridging social capital and cognitive health and brain structure. Given these measures are intercorrelated with each other, it is important not to see them as independent, but rather to treat them as overlapping dimensions of one mechanism to have a full understanding of the link between networks and cognitive health. To this end, we use a latent variable approach to capture the multidimensional nature of bridging social capital. This strategy recognizes the impossibility of perfectly measuring an abstract concept like bridging social capital with a single measure. By treating it as a latent variable, we are able to control for measurement error that can lead to biased inferences about effects (Bollen et al. 2007). In the current study, we aim to provide a holistic measure of bridging social capital capturing structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (Bollen 1989).

The Current Study

This study aims to investigate the link between bridging social capital and cognitive health and brain structure. We first employ traditional measures of structural holes. Subsequently, we explore a latent approach based on proxy measures of bridging social capital, such as structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size. Finally, we compare this latent measure approach with individual measures.

Method

Data

Data were drawn from the Social Networks and Alzheimer Disease (SNAD) study, which recruited participants from the Indiana Alzheimer Disease Research Center (IADRC). The IADRC cohort consisted of older adults with varying levels of cognitive impairment as well as a control group of cognitively normal older adults. Beginning in March 2015, all eligible IADRC participants were approached to voluntarily complete the study (89% response rate). Participants were administered a battery of clinical assessments and neuroimaging procedures, all of which were used to inform a consensus clinical cognitive diagnosis. After their study visit to the IADRC, participants were also asked to complete a social network protocol via face-to-face interview using computer-assisted personal interviewing by trained professional interviewers. The analytic sample for the current study is 277 after excluding 8 participants with severe cognitive impairment [i.e., participants with a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score&lt;10].

Social Network Measures

This project collected data on egocentric social networks by interviewing respondents (i.e., egos) using an expanded version of the PhenX Social Network Battery (SNB) tailored to the case of dementia (Anon 1991). Interviewers elicited names of individuals (i.e., alters) in a participant’s social network that were activated in the past six months for discussions about important matters and health matters (Perry et al. 2018). After names were provided, questions were asked about each person in the network.

Structural holes can be operationalized using different measures. Network density is a measure of structural holes that is used in other studies (Borgatti 1997; Cornwell 2009a). It is a ratio of the number of existing ties among network members relative to the total possible number of ties (see formula below). It ranged from 0-1, lower values indicate presence of structural holes. In this paper, we defined a network tie as absent between two persons if they do not know each other. [We conducted a sensitivity analysis using alternative cut point of whether ties among alters in the network are absent: a tie is considered absent when two alters are reported to be not very close or do not know each other. Using this alternative cutoff did not affect the main findings.] Density=TotalnumberofexsitingtiesbetweenaltersTotalnumberofpossibletiesbetweenalters

We also measured structural holes using the effective size of a person’s network, which estimates the number of non-redundant network members (Burt 2009). We used a modified formula by Borgatti (1997) to calculate the effective size of the ego's network, where t is the number of ties in the network (not including ties to ego) and n is the number of nodes (excluding ego). Higher values indicate presence of structural holes.

Another measure of structural holes was sole bridge status (Cornwell 2009a; Goldman and Cornwell 2015). It is a dichotomous indicator of whether the respondent reports that at least one pair of network members do not know each other, which indicates presence of structural holes; otherwise, it is coded 0 if every alter knows each other in a network.

Network diversity was measured using a modified version of Social Network Index (Cohen et al. 1997), which assesses participation in 12 types of social relationships (ranged from 0-12). These include relationships with a spouse, parents, parents-in-law, children, other close family members, close neighbors, friends, workmates, schoolmates, members of groups without religious affiliations, members of religious groups, and professionals. [In theory, educational or racial diversity in the network would be a good measure of bridging social capital. However, we do not have this information at the moment.]

Weak ties were measured using the minimum value of the strength of ties between egos and each of their alters (ranged from 1-10). This measure follows the tradition of using emotional closeness to operationalize weak ties between individuals (Burt 2009; Sandstrom and Dunn 2014). [We chose not to use average tie strength because it is sometimes treated as a measure of social support or integration. Moreover, the average can wash out substantial heterogeneity. For example, someone with two moderately strong ties and someone with one very strong and one very weak tie would have the same score.]

Network size was measured by the number of unique alters in ego’s network. [We also considered ego betweenness centrality as a measure of bridging social capital, but it was highly correlated to density (r = −0.93) and offered no unique contribution to the latent measure beyond density. Thus, we decided not to include it for the purpose of simplicity.]

Cognitive Health

Three measures were used to measure cognitive health. The first was Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Nasreddine et al. 2005), a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment used by IADRC. The MoCA included tests of memory, visuospatial ability, executive functions, attention, language, and orientation to time and place. The scale ranged from 0-30. Higher scores indicated higher cognitive function.

The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is widely used by clinicians to stage severity of dementia (Hughes et al. 1982; Morris 1993). It rates a respondent’s cognitive performance through a semistructured interview of the patient and a reliable informant/proxy (e.g., a family member or caregiver). Five domains of Memory, Orientation, Judgment and Problem Solving, Community Affairs, and Home and Hobbies are each rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (normal), 0.5 (questionably or minimally impaired), 1 (mildly impaired), 2 (moderately impaired) to 3 (most severely impaired); a sixth domain, Personal Care, is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3 without a rating of 0.5. The ratings of the six individual domains are totaled to calculate the CDR-SB, ranging from 0 (no dementia) to 18 (severe dementia) (Miyagawa et al. 2020).

Brain Structure

Hippocampal volume (bilateral cortical gray matter) was derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed by the Neuroimaging Core of the IADC. All MRI scans were completed on an advanced research-dedicated Siemens PRISMA 3T magnet. T1-weighted MPRAGE structural scans were used to quantitatively characterize brain structure. Brain volumes were extracted from MRI data using FreeSurfer 6 (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), which provides automated parcellation of the brain cortex and subcortical structures. For analyses, hippocampal volume was divided by total intracranial volume to adjust for head size and then standardized (mean = 0; SD = 1). We chose hippocampal volume for three reasons. First, the hippocampus is among the earliest areas of the brain affected by AD (Pennanen et al. 2004), allowing us to detect neuropathology in our sample that is largely asymptomatic. Second, hippocampal volume is linked to dementia (James et al. 2012; Kaye et al. 1997). Finally, this area is implicated in social memory (Kaye et al. 1997).

Controls

All models controlled for gender (female = 0; male = 1), race (Non-White = 0; White = 1), education (years of educational attainment), age (in years), and depressive symptoms, which is measured by 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (Sheikh and Yesavage 1986).

Analytical Strategies

Our analytic approach proceeded in three stages. First, to examine the link between structural holes, cognitive health, and brain structure, each measure of structural holes was used as an independent variable to predict cognitive health (i.e., MoCA socres and CDR-SB) and brain structure (i.e., Hippocampal volume) in separate models. All models controlled for gender, race, education, age, and depressive symptoms.

Second, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to confirm that only one latent construct existed for all measures of structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to fit a measurement model to extract the latent construct of bridging social capital. Once multiple model fitting statistics reached a satisfactory threshold, the measurement model of CFA was incorporated into a structural equation model as an independent variable to evaluate its association with cognitive health and brain structure while controlling for covariates.

Finally, network diversity, weak ties, and network size were used to predict cognitive health and brain structure in separate models with controls. To compare the effect size of extracted latent variable with individual measures of bridging social capital (i.e., structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size), all measures of bridging social capital and health outcomes were standardized to estimate XY standardized beta coefficients in the models. The standardized beta coefficients form a basis of comparison that relies on an estimate of the difference in number of units of standard deviation to expect in the dependent variable for a one standard deviation shift in the explanatory variable.

In addition, to examine whether associations between bridging social capital and cognitive function and brain structure differed across cognitive diagnosis groups, we conducted interaction analyses. Findings are presented in the section on sensitivity analyses.

Missing data were addressed using the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) method via structural equation models (Enders and Bandalos 2001). All analyses were conducted in Stata 16.0.

Results

As shown in Table 1, 40% of our participants were men, 83% were White, mean age was 71 years old, and mean education was 16 years. On average, participants had about 5 alters in their networks, a diversity score of 4 (i.e., 4 different types of relationships across their networks), and minimum tie strength of 7. The mean density was 0.61, the mean effective size was 1.96, and about 51% of participants had at least one pair of network members do not know each other. The average MoCA score was about 24 out of 30, mean CDR-SB was 1 out of 18, and mean unadjusted hippocampal volume was 7254.

Structural Holes, Cognitive Health, and Brain Structure

Regression results suggest that lower network density, higher effective size, and being a sole bridge were associated with higher cognitive function and lower severity of dementia, controlling for age, race, gender, education, and geriatric depression scale (Table 2). For instance, a 1 standard deviation increase in network density (high density indicates low bridging social capital) was related to 0.15 standard deviation decrease in MoCA score. This supports the conclusion that presence of structural holes is associated with better cognitive health. However, no association between three measures of structural holes and hippocampal volume was found.

Extraction of Bridging Social Capital Using EFA &amp; CFA

EFA was conducted based on all 6 variables of bridging social capital, including three measures of structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size. We first used EFA to confirm that only one latent factor should be retained representing bridging social capital. The first factor explained about 76 percent of the variation and was the only factor with an eigenvalue greater than 1. Thus, we fitted a one latent variable model using CFA. The overall fit statistics for CFA suggested very good model fit (model vs. saturated chi-square is insignificant at 0.05 level, CFI = 0.995 which surpasses the 0.95 cut-point, TLI = 0.983 which surpasses the 0.95 cut-point, and RMSEA = .067 which met the threshold of RMSEA &lt; 0.08). [We also fitted a CFA model using 4 items, including one measure of structural holes (density), network diversity, weak ties, and network size, in an attempt to fit a simpler model. However, the 4-item CFA model is not preferred over the 6-item CFA model based on BIC (4143 vs. 3869) and likelihood-ratio test (p&lt;0.001).]

To give readers an intuitive understanding about our latent bridging social capital variable in relation to structural holes, weak ties, network diversity, and network size, we present visualizations of ideal types at different levels of bridging social capital. As shown in Figure 1, respondents with bridging social capital higher than the mean had larger networks, more diversity, weaker ties, and more structural holes, compared to those below the mean.

Relative Performance of Bridging Social Capital Measures

To evaluate the empirical performance of our latent measure of bridging social capital, we conducted a series of separate models using bridging social capital and each of 6 individual network measure to predict cognitive health and brain structure. As shown in Table 3, more bridging social capital was associated with higher MoCA score (beta = 0.20 and p &lt; 0.001), less severity of dementia (beta = −0.23 and p &lt; 0.001), and larger hippocampal volume (beta = 0.16 and p &lt; 0.05), controlling for age, race, gender, education, and geriatric depression scale. This suggests that bridging social capital is associated with cognitive health and brain structure.

Latent bridging social capital had larger effect size and smaller p-value than individual measures (with the exception of minimum tie strength in the case of MoCA and CDR-SB), suggesting its better performance in predicting cognitive health and brain structure. In fact, the latent measure was the only measure that was associated with all three outcomes. The null associations between hippocampal volume and the individual measures of structural holes seem to be in conflict with the positive association between hippocampal volume and the latent bridging variable. However, as shown in Table 3, the effects of individual measures were in the same direction as the latent bridging measure, but had smaller effect sizes. Therefore, these null results were consistent with our argument that individual measures of bridging social capital contain measurement error (Bollen 1989) and only capture one dimension of bridging social capital in networks, thus they tend to underestimate the effect size compared to a latent measurement.

Sensitivity Analyses

We also conducted interaction analysis to examine whether associations between bridging social capital and MoCA and hippocampal volume differed across diagnostic groups. We found that these relationships were significantly stronger in the MCI and Dementia groups compared to the cognitively normal group (Figure A1). Specifically, cognitively normal individuals have high cognitive function and hippocampal volume regardless of bridging social capital. This may suggest that the protective effect of bridging capital on cognitive outcomes can only be observed after some degree of pathology is observable. Put differently, social bridging may protect cognitive health only among those at high risk for cognitive decline.

Discussion

This study found positive relationships between bridging social capital with cognitive health and brain structure in the aging population. This is consistent with previous findings that weak ties were related to cognitive health (Pan and Chee 2020) and network diversity was related to brain structure (Molesworth et al. 2015).

The link between bridging social capital and cognitive health may be explained by the cognitive reserve hypothesis (Stern 2002), which argues that individual variations in cognitively stimulating environments (e.g., bridging social capital) across the life course can build up cognitive reserve and provide different degrees of protection against cognitive decline (Perry et al., 2021). Cognitive reserve protects individuals from brain atrophy through two potential pathways (Stern 2002; Valenzuela et al. 2012): (1) development of greater cognitive capacity prior to brain atrophy; (2) greater efficiency of the brain to compensate for neurodegeneration by recruiting differential brain networks or using alternative cognitive strategies. Sharing ties to a loosely connected groups of dissimilar others is likely to expose individuals to novel information and experiences that could build up cognitive reserve and delay cognitive decline (Granovetter 1973; Perry et al. 2018).

The link between bridging social capital and brain structure may be explained by a phenomenon called neuroplasticity (Cramer et al. 2011; Teter and Ashford 2002). Neuroplasticity is the ability of the nervous system in the brain to make adaptive changes in the face of positive environmental stimuli (e.g., bridging social capital) through growth and reorganization. These changes range from individual neurons making new connections, to systematic adjustments like cortical remapping. From a social network perspective, people with bridging social capital have more exposure to dissimilar and less familiar others, which requires an individual to be cognitively engaged during interactions (Mische and White 1998). Therefore, bridging social capital should constitute a form of positive environmental stimuli that helps maintain brain structure (Chapko et al. 2018; Molesworth et al. 2015).

Our findings also have important methodological implications. There have been multiple calls for empirical research on the measurement of bridging social capital in the field of health and egocentric network analysis (Van Der Gaag and Webber 2008; Villalonga-Olives and Kawachi 2015). In response, the current study used CFA to develop a latent bridging social capital construct that captures information on network structure, tie strength, and network composition simultaneously using six network measures – three measures of structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size. We share the view that bridging social capital is important, but also call attention to the inherent difficulty of measuring it, particularly in aging population with small and dense personal network. Despite evidence that unidimensional measures, such as structural holes, are predictive of cognitive health, our latent-variable models demonstrate that these have limitations. Because single measures of bridging social capital contain measurement error (Bollen 1989) and only capture one dimension of bridging social capital in networks, they tend to underestimate the effect size. In our research, the estimated impact of bridging social capital was larger in the latent-variable models for both cognitive health and brain structure. Consequently, using proxy measures may lead to false negative findings or may underestimate effect size. For example, the effect of structural holes on brain structure fell short of statistical significance, suggesting no association between bridging social capital and brain structure.

It is valuable to connect the concepts of structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size in the context of cognitive aging and bridging social capital. In taking a latent variable approach to measuring bridging social capital, we demonstrate that this social resource is complex and multifactorial, reflected in tie strength, network structure, and network composition. Bridging social capital is an unobservable construct that defies naïve measurement with a single proxy measure. Rather, a latent variable modeling approach that combines multiple collinear measures and accounts for measurement error is preferred, especially when the goal of a study is to examine the link between bridging social capital with cognitive health and brain structure.

Limitations and Future Studies

Given that older adults are likely to experience memory problems, there is a concern about older adults’ ability to provide accurate self-reported social network data. This issue is especially important in this study because 36% of the sample had mild cognitive impairment or early-stage dementia. By comparing network corroboration between respondents’ reports and study informants’ reports, our research team found that cognitively impaired older adults showed no difference in their ability to corroborate accounts of their social networks with their study informants, compared to cognitively normal older adults (Roth et al., 2020). This suggests that self-reported network data offer a reasonable account of the core network members in one’s life even in the early stages of dementia. Nevertheless, we attempted to mitigate this concern by dropping respondents with MoCA score &lt;10. It is also important to note that the wider distribution of cognitive function is useful in investigating the association between social networks and dementia. Although we do not anticipate that the basic conclusions of our study would change in a representative sample, this research should be replicated using a representative population of older adults.

Another limitation of this study was the cross-sectional nature of our data. Without longitudinal data, we cannot be sure about the causal order of the association between bridging social capital with cognitive health and brain structure. Social network contraction may be a response to health impairments (Cornwell 2009a) and it is likely that cognitive impairment leads to disruption in social function (Kotwal et al. 2016). In contrast, social interaction is a lifestyle factor that has been repeatedly documented to slow progression of dementia in clinical trials and prospective longitudinal studies (Kelly et al. 2017; Mortimer et al. 2012). In reality, both causal directions are probably operating. That is a reciprocal relation between social network and cognitive health is likely in effect over time (Li and Zhang 2015). Nevertheless, making conclusions about causality is inappropriate in this study.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that bridging social capital is useful in predicting cognitive health and hippocampal volume even in the small and dense personal networks of older adults. This finding provided much needed association between cognitive health and social interactions with diverse and weak ties. Further, we identified a latent variable of bridging social capital using multiple measures reflecting different dimensions of bridging social capital, namely structural holes, network diversity, weak ties, and network size. The latent variable of bridging social capital was related to cognitive health and brain structure, suggesting the robust link between bridging social capital, cognitive health, and brain structure. Finally, the latent measure showed improved performance over single measures of bridging social capital in the context of cognitive aging research.
