Introduction

Post-mortem analysis provides definitive diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases; however, only a few can be diagnosed during life.

Methods

This study employed statistical tools and machine learning to predict 17 neuropathologic lesions from a cohort of 6,518 individuals using 381 clinical features. The multisite data allowed validation of the model’s robustness by splitting train/test sets by clinical sites. A similar study was performed for predicting Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) neuropathologic change without specific comorbidities.

Results

Prediction results show high performance for certain lesions that match or exceed that of research annotation. Neurodegenerative comorbidities in addition to AD neuropathologic change resulted in compounded, but disproportionate, effects across cognitive domains as the comorbidity number increased.

Discussion

Certain clinical features could be strongly associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, others were lesion-specific, and some were divergent between lesions. Our approach could benefit clinical research, and genetic and biomarker research by enriching cohorts for desired lesions.

pmcBackground

While impressive progress has been made in biofluid biomarkers and molecular imaging to identify some components of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neuropathologic assessment of autopsy brain remains the only tool to determine comprehensively the presence and extent of the other common diseases that frequently contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia in older individuals[1]. Indeed, it now has been replicated in multiple cohorts that these diseases, which can occur in isolation but often are comorbid with AD, are critically important to the risk of dementia and are potential targets for preventive therapy[2]. In a clinical trial context, these comorbidities also could interfere with the purity of the AD cohort, undermining the adequacy of clinical trial design. As physicians and scientists await further progress in biomarkers and neuroimaging tools to provide intra vitam insight into these common diseases of the aging brain, there is a desperate need to develop alternative approaches to estimate the extent of brain comorbidities in individual research participants.

Research suggests that multiple features during life are associated with specific neuropathologic lesions that define AD and other common diseases of aging brain. For example, type 2 diabetes was linked to lower Thal and Braak stages[3]. As such, some studies have suggested no significant association or even significantly lower chance of ADNC in cases with type 2 diabetes[4-8]. A similar conclusion was found through genetic study with more than half of the shared SNPs between the two diseases having divergent risk alleles[9]. Non-amnestic cognitive impairment and fluctuating concentration/attention were associated with Lewy body disease (LEWY)[10,11]. LEWY may also result in a faster rate of cognitive and functional decline, particularly when comorbid with Alzheimer’s Disease neuropathologic change (ADNC)[12,13]. TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal lesions are associated with hippocampal/mesial temporal sclerosis (HIPSCL-SCL)[14,15], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis[16], as well as some forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)[17] and commonly are comorbid with ADNC[18]. These are but a few examples of many associations between features observed during life and brain autopsy findings.

Several groups have investigated the application of machine learning to identify neuropathologic lesions. Many of these incorporated imaging data[19-22] and have made advances in predicting lesions such as HIPSCL. In our particular study, we focused on the large National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset, which does not have comprehensive imaging data, to enable virtual neuropathologic research in the vast majority of NACC participants who did not volunteer for brain donation. Based on these past investigations, the present work aims to consolidate a wide range of clinical features and predict over 17 neuropathologic lesions using machine learning methods. Interpretation of the model would reveal clinical features that are critical for certain lesions. Applications of our approach may also include using predicted neuropathologic features to enrich cohort selection for clinical trials or provide predicted endophenotypes in large genetic, biomarker, and neuroimaging studies.

Method

Data Preprocessing

Data were from the NACC data freeze in March 2021 and included all NACC data on all individuals with a brain autopsy. The variable names for neuropathologic lesions come from NACC Neuropathology Form version 10. This study investigated the presence/absence, or low/high amount, of a total of 17 neuropathologic lesions with a summary of variable acronyms compared to NACC variable names and the binarization method described in Table 1. The binarization process allows easier interpretation of the model performance across all prediction tasks. The original assessment methods of these neuropathologic variables, as well as clinical ones, can be found in the NP annotated form, instructions for the neuropsych battery (C2) form, and more on the NACC documentation page[23]. The presence of ADNC was not readily available in NACC, but was derived from the other neuropathologic lesions using the following logic: (1) ADNC=1if(BRAA&gt;0)∩((NEUR&gt;0)∪(DIFF&gt;0))else0

This defines ADNC (&gt;0 in equation (1)) as the presence of these neuropathologic lesions in any amount, i.e., participants with a Braak stage more than 0 with either a density of diffuse plaques or neocortical neuritic plaques more than 0 were considered ADNC positive. From this definition, it should be noted that ADNC refers to the presence of any level of ADNC. We next define a subcase ADNClow as those with only low level of ADNC-related lesions: (2) ADNClow≡(ADNC=1)∩(BRAA&lt;III)∩(NEUR∈{None,Low})∩(DIFF∈{None,Low})

, and ADNChigh as those with only intermediate or high level of ADNC-related lesions: (3) ADNChigh≡(ADNC=1)∩(BRAA&gt;II)∩(NEUR∈{Inter.,Freq.})∩(DIFF∈{Inter.,Freq.})

Using Equations 1-3, we determined the presence or absence of ADNC and further dichotomized data into low and high, while recognizing that previous NACC versions can be difficult to align exactly. This is especially true for primary age-related tauopathy (PART), which at least in some cases are partially overlapping with our ADNC group. We did not include PART in our model because it is not a data entry field in NACC.

Apart from this, two NACC variables, NPHIPSCL and NPSCL, were combined to provide a single score (HIPSCL-SCL) for sclerosis of the mesial temporal lobe. pTDP-43 inclusions were scored in several brain regions and when in combination these are referred to as “TDPs”. Note that pTDP-43 in the spinal cord (NPTDPA in NACC Form 10 variable name) was excluded due to its extremely low prevalence.

For the prediction of clinically diagnosed AD without certain comorbidities, cases with none or low of the corresponding neuropathologic comorbidity are encoded as 1 because it is a desirable feature. Otherwise, the case is encoded as 0. Processing of the clinical features can be found in the Supplementary Methods.

Multitask Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) Model Predictions and Cross-site Evaluation

A multitask LSTM deep learning architecture was employed for both the investigation of neuropathologic change predictions and comorbidity predictions. The LSTM component of the model allows it to leverage longitudinal data by its capacity to handle inputs with variable numbers of visits[24,25]. The multitask prediction, i.e. predicting all 17 neuropathologic changes simultaneously, encourages the model to learn combined representations for all tasks, and hence leverages correlations among them to improve the model’s performance as previously shown in other fields of study[26]. Note that for the prediction of comorbidities, cases of ADNC without selected comorbidities were designated as a positive class, and the number of tasks was reduced to 13 as we did not consider the prediction of ADNC-related lesions alone (ADNC, DIFF, BRAA, NEUR).

The model was composed of an LSTM layer followed by two feed-forward layers, before splitting into different task-specific prediction heads, each with another two feed-forward layers. To account for data imbalance in some lesions, we implemented a recently developed class-weighted balance loss function in our deep learning algorithm to improve the prediction performance by accounting for less frequent instances[27]. We used NACC's prespecified mapping of variables across the different versions of NACC forms. Variables not included in earlier versions of NACC forms were treated as missing. Instances with missing labels, which include any of the “Not assessed”, “Not available”, or “Missing/unknown” labels in the NACC dataset dictionary, were excluded from the loss calculation of the task from which it was missing during training. In the test set, these instances were exempted from model performance evaluation. The model was optimized by adaptive moment estimation with decoupled weight decay regularization (AdamW) using default parameters[28]. The model was implemented using PyTorch 1.9.0, and the variable visit length was handled by using zero padding and PyTorch’s pack_padded_sequence to save computational time by automating batches of the same sequence sizes. Note that we have also tested other deep-learning models that explicitly takes into account irregular visit interval, such as tLSTM[29], however, no improvement over typical LSTM was observed. This is likely because the visit interval in NACC, albeit irregular, were only 1.2±0.6 years, well within the period that previous studies reported none-to-small changes in clinical measures from pathology development[2].

To evaluate model performance, we employed a 5-fold cross-validation scheme, where the data was split into train and test sets. The model was trained only on the train set and tested on the unseen data using the area under the receiver’s operating curve (AUROC) and precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as criteria. While our study did not focus on rare events, because there is class imbalance in many lesions, both AUROC and AUPRC were needed to comprehensively evaluate the model (AUROC tends to be optimistic with low number of positive classes, and vice versa for AUPRC). Because the NACC dataset comprises data from 37 sites, the test set samples were selected from sites that will not be included in the train set to ensure the model’s generalizability across sites. Specifically, the top ten sites with the highest number of cases were chosen to generate the final five test sets, each comprising two sites. We performed 5 iterations of cross-validation. In each iteration, we selected the test cases, which included all years of their visit history, based on site to ensure generalizability across all sites. No single visit year of any individual in the test set was used in the training. In each iteration, 2 of the 10 biggest sites by case numbers were used as the test set, and the rest were the training. Five percent of the training set was randomly selected as a validation set for model stopping during training. The test set size in each iteration was 574 (9%), 603 (9%), 659 (10%), 792 (12%), and 882 cases (14% of all cases). The lesion distribution in each iteration is shown in Fig. S1.

Results

Preliminary analyses showed correlations among clinical features of the same modalities and among some neuropathologic lesions

Figure 1A shows the overall approach of our study from the description of the NACC cohort across 37 sites to data splitting in a cross-site validation scheme. The selected NACC cohort had more male cases (54%) than female ones, both with similar age at the last visit, level of educational attainment, longitudinal visit number and frequency, and rate of ADNC. However, male cases tended to have a higher rate of cognitive impairment, likely due to other comorbidities. After removing features that are missing in more than 10% of the cases, the 381 clinical features (Fig. 1B, full list shown in Table. S1) of the cases in the training set (35 sites out of the 37 sites) were fed to the model to train to predict 17 neuropathologic lesions (Fig. 1C). Note that, the correlation network (Fig. 1B, see Supplementary Methods for details), where each node represents a feature and each edge signifies a strong correlation between the two, suggests strong correlations among clinical features within the same modality as seen by the proximity of their nodes. The model performance was then evaluated on the 2 unseen test sites. This cross-site validation process was repeated 5 times to obtain the average prediction performance. More details can be found in the method section.

All 6,518 individuals in the NACC dataset with any of the 17 selected neuropathologic lesions from the brain autopsy data were included (Fig. 1C). They each had between 1 to 15 clinical visits. The prevalence of the 17 lesions is presented in Fig. 1D. We dichotomized the pathologic lesions according to the method outlined in Table 1 to facilitate interpretation of the model performance across all 17 prediction tasks. ADNC and related neuropathologic changes were the most frequent, followed by arteriolosclerosis (ARTE), Lewy body disease (LEWY), and atherosclerosis (AVAS). Notably, cases with LEWY, HIPSCL-SCL, or particularly TDPs were more likely to have a diagnosis of dementia (Fig. 1E), in agreement with previous reports[30].

TDPs from different regions were highly correlated (Spearman’s R=0.48 to 0.78; Fig. 1C) with TDP-Neocortex having the lowest correlation with other TDPs, but when present, it was almost always comorbid with all other TDPs (Fig. S2A), consistent with findings of others[31]. Also agreeing with previous reports[15,32], TDPs also were correlated with HIPSCL-SCL (Spearman’s R=0.27 to 0.43; Fig. 1C). Seventy-six percent of the cases with HIPSCL-SCL have TDPs, and 35% vice versa (Fig. S2B). As expected, the presence of ADNC was moderately correlated (Spearman’s R from 0.54 to 0.65) with its three component scores, BRAA, DIFF, and NEUR, which also were weakly correlated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (AMY; Spearman’s R from 0.27 to 0.32) likely because both diseases shared amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition[33]. Note that among these three, NEUR (Spearman’s R=0.30) has the highest correlation to cognitive impairment, followed by BRAA (R=0.22) and DIFF (R=0.20).

Neuropathologic lesions commonly co-occurred. For example, using ADNC as the reference, about 35%-37% of the cases had at least LEWY, AMY, or TDPs comorbidity (Fig. 1F; Fig. S2B). Many studies have shown that comorbid ADNC and LEWY or ADNC and TDP are more common than expected by chance. For ADNC and LEWY this is likely because of shared risk factors, and the presentation of this combination of brain lesions is labeled diagnostically as Dementia with Lewy Bodies[33,34]. Comorbid ADNC with TDP also is widely reported and is an area of intense investigation[35,36].

Predictions show high performance for certain neuropathologic lesions

Clinical features from all longitudinal visits were fed to the multitask long-short term memory (LSTM) model. An LSTM model is a neural network architecture that exploits longitudinal patterns of the inputs to make predictions. Our LSTM model was constructed as a multitask network that trained and generated predictions of all neuropathologic lesions simultaneously while leveraging correlations among them to improve overall results (Fig. 1A). This paper primarily focused on lesions that are available in most cases, but included TDP-43 lesions because of high current interest, despite high missingness. In contrast, Thal phase, which also had high missingness, was not included because it correlated strongly to already included measures of ADNC as derived in (1) (ex. R=0.74 with DIFF). When Thal phase (THAL) was added into the existing model or substituted for DIFF, the result was similar performance as the original model for most lesions, but lowered performance for some important ones, including LEWY, HIPSCL-SCL, and TDP-43 (Fig. S3). This may be due to the multitask model having to balance THAL performance with other high missingness lesions.

The multitask LSTM model can predict all ADNC-related lesions (ADNC, BRAA, DIFF, NEUR) well with most AUROCs&gt;0.80 and AUPRCs&gt;0.90 (Fig. 2A). In comparison, previous similarity-based models using clinical features yielded an AUROC of 0.68 for ADNC[37,38]. A random guess would yield an AUROC of 0.50 and an AUPRC approximately equivalent to the prevalence, which is shown as patterned boxes in Fig. 2A. Approximating the odds ratio (OR) and Pearson’s R of the BRAA predictions based on the AUROC yielded an OR of 11.56 and R of 0.57[39,40]. These tend to be higher than previous reports for most domains of neuropsychiatric symptoms[41,42] or individual tests like MMSE or CDR[43,44] related to BRAA stages. Apart from these, the model also can predict LEWY (AUROC=0.75; AUPRC=0.56) and AVAS (AUROC=0.70; AUPRC=0.61) moderately well. Compared to previous studies, the LEWY performance was higher than using either cognitive fluctuations or visual hallucinations alone[45], but it should be noted that a higher AUROC of 0.85 was obtained previously in a small cohort using Hooper Visual Organization Test[46]. The higher AUROC could be due to the different tasks; others separated pure normal controls from pure LEWY, whereas we separated LEWY from any cases without LEWY.

Notably, the model also could predict TDPs and HIPSCL-SCL with good AUROCs although with lower AUPRC due to their low prevalence in the dataset. It should be stressed that the importance of the model is that it allows the prediction of neuropathologic features, e.g., HIPSCL-SCL (AUROC=0.74) that typically require extensive imaging analyses[47-50] or are clinically difficult to diagnose, e.g., TDP-43 lesions. Recent studies showed that clinical characteristics yielded ORs of 0.76 to 1.16[51] and neuropsychological tests yielded ORs of 2.60 to 3.50[52] for limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). In comparison, our approximated OR from the mean AUROCs among the four TDP NACC variables was 4.82, highlighting the benefits of our method that non-linearly combines multiple clinical and neuropsychological features. Additional analysis of the model performance when stratifying cases as LATE-TDP or FTLD-TDP showed that the model performed slightly better for LATE-TDP. Particularly, the model increased the precision of predicting LATE-TDP over random guess more than FTLD-TDP (Fig. S4).

The ROC and PRC for ADNC, LEWY, AVAS, TDP-Amygdala, and TDP-neocortex are shown in Fig. 2B. For comparison, the value of these metrics for ADNC and LEWY from clinicians’ diagnoses, i.e. AD dementia and dementia with Lewy body (DLB), were included as “x” marks. Our results showed that the model outperformed the clinical diagnosis, particularly in AUPRC, i.e. the x mark is well below (and to the left) of the LEWY’s AUPRC curve from the model.

Other lesions, such as HIPSCL-SCL, INF, ARTE, AMY, and WMR, also yielded interesting results, but due to limited space and focus, they will be excluded from further analysis. Modality-specific performance is also available in Fig. S5. Note that model performance did not change significantly when the interval between the last clinical evaluation and autopsy was limited to 1 yr, 2 yr, 3yr, or not limited for this dataset (Fig. S6; mean and standard deviation of time from the last visit to death shown in Fig. 1A). Moreover, due to the highly correlated nature of the clinical features, model performance remained similar even if clinical diagnosis features were not used as part of the model inputs (Fig. S7).

Each dot on the barplot in Fig. 2A represents the performance of a site, hence together also the variation among sites. We did not attempt to mitigate variability across sites because it may be intrinsic to the populations around the site; however, we did attempt to understand how population variability across sites may affect model performance. For example, we conducted an error analysis for ADNC prediction and found that the model performance decreases in sites with higher ratios of resilient cases (see Supplementary Methods and Fig. S8 for detail) meaning individuals with moderate or high levels of ADNC who were resilient to the clinical expression of cognitive impairment or dementia[53]. This is expected because by definition resilient cases are cognitively indistinguishable from normal controls.

Model reduction to top-k features reveals important clinical features

To identify the most important features that would allow the model to achieve the same performance as using all features, the top k number of features were selected in the training set for each lesion and combined to feed into the model (see Supplementary Methods for detail). After one-hot encoding of categorical features for feeding into a deep learning model, the original 381 features became 853. The performance of the interested lesions as a function of the top k features indicates that approximately only the top 25, 25, 15, and 10 one-hot encoded features were needed for the ADNC, LEWY, AVAS, and TDPs (Fig. 2C). Correlation-based feature selection was used due to its interpretation simplicity and stability. Note that the identified features may not be singularly the most important features due to the highly correlated nature of the clinical data. Other recently developed deep-learning explainability methods, such as integrated gradients[54], were also attempted but did not yield stable results, meaning that the attribution standard deviation was orders of magnitude greater than the mean absolute attribution. This could be due to some limitations, such as known problems with multicollinearity and identifying good attribution baselines in tabular data[55,56].

Visualization of these features in a heatmap shows that the top features can be stratified into 13 groups according to the cutoff from hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2D). Each of these clusters was either strongly correlated to a single domain of lesions, moderately strong across multiple lesions, or exhibiting diverging trends across lesions. Groups 1, 4, 7, and 8 were strongly correlated to ADNC that only mostly contained individuals diagnosed with AD dementia. Some of these features include APOE ε4, which was about 4-fold more likely with ADNC, and bvFTD diagnosis which was about 5-fold less likely with ADNC (Fig. 3A). This is congruent with literature reporting that AD is uncommon in cases with bvFTD diagnosis[56]. Cases with memory impairment as a predominant symptom or cognition as the first changed domain each had a 4-fold higher ADNC prevalence than those that did not (Fig. 3A).

Groups 3 and 5 were moderately correlated with all lesions except for AVAS. These were predominantly features related to cognitive impairment, including clinical dementia rating (CDR) or cognitive test performance, such as digit symbol and story recall (Fig. 3B). Group 6 showed mild negative correlations with ADNC, but mostly positively associated with TDPs, particularly in the neocortex. These were primarily FTLD and its mutation (Fig. 3C), executive function or language as the first sign of cognitive impairment, and personality change. Note that in NACC’s Uniform Data Set v3, “FTLD mutation” includes MAPT, PGRN, C9orf72, FUS, and Other[23]. In cases with personality changes, the prevalence of ADNC was reduced by half, whereas TDP-Neocortex increased 3-fold compared to cases without (Fig. 3D). This remained the case even for ADNC cases with no TDP-Neocortex (Fig. S9). Previous reports show that there were no changes in personality during the preclinical phase of AD, only at the onset and progression of dementia[53,59], suggesting that changes in personality could arise from comorbidities as dementia progresses. On the other hand, personality change was reported to be associated with FTLD-TDP[58].

Group 12 indicated features for LEWY only, which included a clinical diagnosis of DLB or PD, or visual hallucinations (Fig. 3E). Groups 9, 11, and 13 were strongly correlated with AVAS only, where cases with AVAS tended to have hypertension or stroke, older age (Fig. 3F), or abnormal hearing. Interestingly, living with partners or in a private residence was also associated with a lower likelihood of AVAS, perhaps suggesting that social interaction or a better diet may be environmental features that lower the risk of AVAS.

Higher comorbidity with ADNC leads to worse outcomes and could be domain-specific

Comorbidities signaled by multiple neuropathologic lesions can compound the effect on cognitive decline. Altogether, these neuropathologic features accounted for 51-84% of the variance in neuropsychological test scores, clinical dementia rating (CDR), and cognitive status. Individually, the variance explained by each test ranged from 2-83% with ADNC being the highest at 30-83% across tests (Table S2). Although using a different evaluation of cognitive tests, this is higher than previous reports of 22-36% of variance explained by ADNC[60,61]. This discrepancy may be due to the NACC dataset being highly enriched for participants with AD. With the age of the group controlled, individuals with a higher number of comorbidities tended to have worse performance in cognitive ratings and neuropsychological battery tests across all domains (Fig. 4A). This is consistent with previous studies from multiple community and population cohorts that showed at least additive and, in some cases, synergistic interaction among comorbidities and the risk of dementia[2,12].

We defined low or high ADNC and then examined the impact on ADNClow of additional lesions. These could be a more severe form of ADNC, i.e. ADNClow with high BRAA or ADNChigh, or other comorbidities. In ADNClow (ADNC cases with no or low BRAA, DIFF, or NEUR), a similar general trend can be observed where more comorbidities resulted in higher fold changes (Fig. 4B). The bubble heatmap also shows other notable findings. Generally, auditory attention and working memory (Digit Span) were invariable to the comorbidities added to ADNClow (Fig. 4B) as both the effect and −log10(Q) values were negligibly small across all combinations. In contrast, moderate effects were observed for other attention/executive measures (e.g., verbal fluency, Trail Making Test, and Digit Symbol). Global cognitive function (MMSE)/clinician rating (CDR), verbal learning and memory (Logical Memory Immediate and Delayed Recall), and clinician ratings of memory and orientation were most prominently affected by adding comorbidities to ADNClow.

Interestingly, ADNClow cases with higher stages of only BRAA or DIFF did not necessarily result in worse performance on any cognitive test (Fig. 4B row 1 and 2). In fact, as long as high-level pathologic changes were limited to only two of the three ADNC-related lesions, there was not much impact on any cognitive tests (Fig. 4B row 3, 5, and 6). However, once all three ADNC lesions were at an intermediate or high level (ADNChigh), then the impact became noticeable across most tests (excluded Digit Span) (Fig. 4B row 8), especially those for memory (Fig. 4C). Note that a subset of ADNChigh with only HIPSCL-SCL or MICR comorbidity also exhibited worse performance on verbal memory, but their performance on speed-attention-executive tasks was not significantly changed from ADNClow (Fig. 4B row 12; Fig. 4C). The same conclusion was reached even if the comparison basis was expanded to all ADNC cases except ADNChigh (n=131) versus ADNChigh with HIPSCL-SCL (Fig. S10). Notably, even without having ADNChigh, similar cognitive declines could also manifest in ADNClow cases with BRAA and LEWY comorbidities (Fig. 4B row 4).

Comorbidity Prediction Improves Building of ADNC Cohort without TDPs

The results above suggest that there could be varying clinical patterns in ADNC with different comorbidities. We next used a multitask LSTM model to classify whether an individual diagnosed with AD dementia did not have comorbid lesions in addition to ADNC. Best performing predictions were for ADNC cases without TDP-Amygdala, TDP-Hippocampus, or TDP-EC/ITC (Fig. 5A). For LEWY results, previous work Using logistic regression model reported an AUROC of 0.75 for the prediction of LEWY in their training set[62]. This is equivalent to our test set performance, suggesting superior performance from our model. A similar performance was achieved for separating LEWY from ADNC using the Hooper Visual Organization Test[46].However, by benchmarking against a clinical diagnosis of DLB, the model performed slightly worse than clinicians for classifying ADNC without LEWY (Fig. 5B).

Among TDP cases, TDP-Amygdala comorbidity with ADNC had the lowest performance (AUROC=0.61; AUPRC=0.76) and TDP-Neocortex was the highest (AUROC=0.67; AUPRC=0.95). An example of important features that isolate ADNC with and without TDP-Amygdala was the difficulty to pay attention (Fig. 5C). FTLD mutation remains the most significant feature that separates ADNC with and without TDP-Neocortex (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, TDP-Hippocampus and TDP-EC/ITC had the best improvement compared to random chance (+0.06 AUPRC), where the most correlated features for these two lesions classes were performance on memory tests and functional activity questionnaires. This may be useful for selecting subcohorts in clinical trials to improve their purity (Fig. 5D).

Discussion

Neurodegenerative diseases that cause dementia are clinicopathologic entities, meaning that they are defined by a complex and partially overlapping set of signs and symptoms as well as hallmark pathologic lesions. Indeed, the hallmark lesions identified at autopsy remain the gold standard evidence for and amount of a particular disease in the brain. Continued reliance on autopsy data is a major barrier to progress in clinical research into diseases that impair cognition and is the motivation for major efforts to develop disease-specific biomarkers. Unfortunately, except for AD, the development of such biomarkers has yet to be successful in research settings and none have yet to have a major impact in clinical settings. Moreover, the existing AD biomarkers have varying levels of invasiveness and price, casting some doubt on accessibility. This lack of insight into the disease(s) present in an individual’s brain is very likely undermining genetic and imaging cohort studies as well as clinical trials. Now that disease-specific therapies to prevent or treat some of the common causes of cognitive impairment are emerging[63,64], the implications of inadequate or inaccessible biomarkers cloud the future of precision medicine for people afflicted with cognitive impairment.

Our goal is to use neuropathologic data from the minority of NACC participants who volunteered for brain donation to predict neuropathologic features in those who did not volunteer for brain donation, thereby enabling future virtual pathologic research in genetic, biomarker, and imaging endophenotypes for the vast majority of NACC participants. We did not attempt predictive modeling using other clinico-pathologic datasets, such as NINDS common data elements, or other neuropathologic features not included in NACC, such as primary age-related tauopathy (PART), because these clinical and neuropathologic data were not collected or structured in the same way as NACC. We did include clinical diagnosis recognizing that this is not yet the “ground truth” for predicting neuropathologic lesions for neurodegenerative diseases and commonly is confounded by difficult-to-diagnose comorbidities that complicate dementia research that is based on clinical diagnosis alone. The performance of our NACC-specific model was validated instead by detecting previously well-established clinico-pathologic correlations and by using a cross-site validation scheme.

We tested the hypothesis that data routinely collected during life can be used to predict the presence of 17 different brain lesions. The data used was from the 6,518 NACC participants who had donated their brains for research. By training the multitask LSTM model and then testing it on completely non-overlapping sites, our results showed successful predictions of ADNC, BRAA, DIFF, NEUR, LEWY, AVAS, and TDPs with high AUROC and high AUPRC compared to chance. Cognitive test/rating results were critical for making the predictions. Some individual cognitive tests were more predictive for certain lesions than others, such as Part B of the Trail Making Test for ADNC, while others were not lesion-specific, such as the Digit Symbol test. Health information improved performance for specific lesions, such as personality change for TDPs, hallucinations for LEWY, or hypertension for AVAS. We performed model reduction, which resulted in a limited number of features necessary to achieve similar performance to using all clinical features and made the model available for public use (github.com/tpjoe/predicting_neuropathologic_changes).

We found that several measures of cognitive function, including global cognitive functioning, verbal learning and memory, working memory, and verbal fluency, worsened as the number of comorbidities increased, but the effects could be disproportionate across domains. Interestingly, adding any two high levels of AD-related lesions to ADNClow was not associated with lower cognitive test performance; however, if all three were present at a high level (ADNChigh), then the impact became significant compared to ADNClow. These results suggest that it is the pathophysiologic processes underlying the full repertoire of ADNC, rather than select lesions, that drive cognitive impairment as determined by neuropsychological tests. This contrasts with a diagnosis of dementia, which derives only in part from neuropsychological test results, and that is most closely associated with BRAA.

Another model for isolating ADNC from common comorbidities was developed, and achieved the highest performance in isolating ADNC from ADNC with TDPs, particularly TDP-Hippocampus and TDP-EC/ITC, where the most important features that separate ADNC from ADNC with these TDPs were age, memory test performance, and functional activity questionnaires, such as difficulty or needing help with paying attention.

Strengths of our study are that it used data from a large, multisite, publicly available database, and that we made our model publicly available to facilitate future research. There are several limitations to our study. First, our model is NACC-specific by design. Although NACC is large and our predictive model will enable future virtual neuropathology research for the vast majority of NACC participants who did not have a neuropathologic evaluation, its application is restricted to NACC participants, which only includes data from the United States. Future work will be required to identify the subset of ubiquitously collected and uniformly assessed clinical features that retain model performance to facilitate the portability of the model to non-NACC cohorts. Some recently recognized important neuropathologic features are not yet well represented in NACC, like TDP-43 lesions and Thal phasing, and these will need to be revisited as the NACC dataset grows. Some important neuropathologic diagnoses, like PART, are not included in the NACC database and these will need to be included in the model when the NACC database is revised. Finally, as is now well established, comorbidities existed in most cases in the dataset, likely complicating the interpretation of feature importance and limiting direct comparison of the prediction performance to other existing clinico-pathologic correlations.

Overall, we have shown that a set of clinical features can be used to predict neuropathologic lesions and, for some, their occurrence with ADNC. Our work highlights the most predictive features of each neuropathologic lesion instead of giving equal balance to most information in this multisite research database. Models that use data collected during life to enhance prediction of neuropathologic lesions may help clinicians and researchers enrich study cohorts and more accurately determine associations with neuroimaging, biomarker, and genetic features.

(A) Schematic diagram of the process starting from cohort (with description shown) to train/test splitting for cross-site validation. The subfigure also shows a schematic diagram of the multitask LSTM model that takes longitudinal clinical features as input and outputs a prediction of 17 neuropathologic changes for each individual. The 381 clinical features (Figure 1B, full list shown in Table S1) of the cases in the training set (35 sites out of the 37 sites) were fed to the model to train to predict 17 neuropathologic lesions (Figure 1C). Note that, the correlation network (Figure 1B, see Supplementary Methods for details), where each node represents a feature and each edge signifies a strong correlation between the two, suggests strong correlation among clinical features within the same modality as seen by the proximity of their nodes. The model performance was then evaluated on the two unseen test sites. This cross-site validation process was repeated 5 times to obtain the average prediction performance. More details can be found in the method section. (B) A correlation network with a t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) derived layout showing correlation of clinical features where each node is a clinical feature and edges represent the top 10% of Spearman’s correlation P-value among feature pairs. t-SNE is a nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm that took in all 381 clinical features as input and reduced the information into two dimensions, where similar features were put closer together, to allow feature visualization. 65 The node is colored by the modality of the features. Each modality is described along with the number of features within it. More correlated clinical features situate closer together. (C) The correlations among neuropathologic lesions indicate a strong correlation (Spearman’s) among pTDP-43 inclusions in multiple brain regions and a moderate correlation of pTDP-43 inclusions (TDPs) to HIPSCL-SCL, ARTE, and WMR.

(F) A Venn diagram displaying the number of cases with ADNC, LEWY, and AMY comorbidities.

FIGURE 2. Cross-site multitask model prediction indicates high performance for certain neuropathologic lesions and revealed a critical set of clinical features. (A) The cross-site LSTM model prediction performance was reported as the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) for all of the available lesions. Note that a random prediction would approximately yield an AUROC of 0.5 and AUPRC equivalent to the prevalence of that lesion (shown as gray patterned bars). (B) The ROC and PRC of the selected lesions, including ADNC, AVAS, LEWY, and TDPs. For comparison purposes in ADNC and LEWY, the “x” marks pinpoint sensitivity, specificity, and precision based on clinical diagnosis of AD dementia or dementia with Lewy body (DLB). (C) Model reduction by using only top-k clinical features and their resulting performance for the selected neuropathologic lesions (ADNC, AVAS, LEWY, and TDPs) to yield similar performance as using all clinical features, that is, the point where the AUROC started to plateau. (D) A heatmap of all top 70 clinical features for the lesions grouped into 13 different sections according to the cutoff on the hierarchical clustering shown in the red line.

FIGURE 3. Example of strong, shared, or diverging clinical features for neuropathologic lesions. (A) Apart from clinician diagnosis, examples of other uniquely strong ADNC-correlated features are the presence of APOE ε4 allele, absence of bvFTD diagnosis, impaired memory as a predominant symptom, and cognition as the first area of change. The numbers on bar graphs indicate fold count ratios between with or without lesions. (B) Examples of features are moderately correlated among all features except for AVAS. (C) FTLD hereditary mutation is the strongly correlated feature for the TDP-Neocortex. (D) The opposite trend of ADNC (without TDP-neocortex) vs TDP-neocortex (also shown in section 10 of Figure 3B), such as personality change, where the presence of personality change is negatively correlated to ADNC, but positively for TDPs. (E) Apart from clinician diagnosis of DLB, hallucination is a uniquely correlated feature to LEWY. (F) Strongly correlated features of only AVAS are hypertension and age.

FIGURE 4 Higher number of comorbidities worsens cognitive test performance and some combinations of comorbidities with ADNC result in significantly different degrees of change in symptoms. (A) Fold change in neuropsychological battery test performance and clinical dementia rating (CDR) as the number of comorbidity increases. The fold change is calculated from the difference in the mean score of the selected combination of lesions and the mean score of ADNClow divided by the mean score of ADNClow. Each dot represents a test or rating type. The comparison was controlled for age by only selecting cases within ± 1SD of the mean age of cases with only one neuropathologic lesion. (B) The fold change in ADNClow with different comorbidity combinations (with at least 15 cases) compared to cases with pure ADNClow (n = 42) of the same age range. The size of each bubble indicates the Q value from the Mann-Whitney U test, whereas the color intensity represents the fold change min-max normalized within each test type. The fold change number is written in each bubble with negative sign inverted, that is, positive numbers indicate worse performance. (C) An example of a significant change or no change in trail-making test B and CDR–Memory of ADNC cases with selected comorbidities compared to pure ADNClow.

FIGURE 5 Multitask LSTM model can improve ADNC cohort purity by predicting ADNC without selected comorbidities. (A) The cross-site LSTM model prediction AUROC and AUPRC for the prediction of clinical AD cases without each of the comorbidities (positive class). Only cases with clinically diagnosed AD dementia were considered. The patterned bars indicate the prevalence of AD dementia with each neuropathologic comorbidity. (B) The ROC and PRC of the interested comorbid lesions, including LEWY, HIPSCL-SCL, and TDPs. For comparison in LEWY comorbidity, the “x” marks pinpoint sensitivity, specificity, and precision based on LBD, the only clinically available diagnosis. (C) Top univariate features that best separate clinical AD cases without TDP-Amygdala or TDP-Neocortex comorbidity. (D) Cohort size versus positive predictive value (PPV) curve to visualize the performance of the model for purifying ADNC-focused cohorts.

Research in Context

Systematic review

The authors reviewed the literature using traditional approaches (e.g., PubMed and Google Scholar). Most of the previous reports were a univariate association of a clinical feature to a single neuropathologic lesion. The use of machine learning to combine clinical features, excluding imaging data, was uncommon and still using linear models that focused on a single lesion. These relevant citations are appropriately cited.

Interpretation

Our modeling led to the identification of a set of clinical features that were highly associated and, together, predictive for each neuropathologic lesion. These associations were consistent with clinico-pathologic associations already published by others and serve as independent validation of our predictive model.

Future Directions

The model was made publicly available for use in other studies. Future studies could leverage our approach to generate predicted neuropathologic features to guide selection for clinical trials or provide predicted endophenotypes in genetic, biomarker, and neuroimaging studies.
