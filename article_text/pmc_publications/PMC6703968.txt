Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasing health problem. It is a complex, progressive disease that consists of many factors affecting memory. Studies have shown that increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability initiates pathological changes in neuro-vascular network but the role of cerebrovascular dysfunction and its mediated mechanisms associated with memory reduction during TBI are still not well understood. Changes in BBB, inflammation, extravasation of blood plasma components, activation of neuroglia lead to neurodegeneration. Extravasated proteins such as amyloid-beta, fibrinogen, and cellular prion protein may form degradation resistant complexes that can lead to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. They also have the ability to activate astrocytes, and thus, can be involved in memory impairment. Understanding the triggering mechanisms and the places they originate in vasculature or in extravascular tissue may help to identify potential therapeutic targets to ameliorate memory reduction during TBI. The goal of this review is to discuss conceptual mechanisms that lead to short-term memory reduction during non-severe TBI considering distinction between vascular and non-vascular effects on neurons. Some aspects of these mechanisms need to be confirmed further. Therefore, we hope that the discussion presented bellow may lead to experiments that may clarify the triggering mechanisms of memory reduction after head trauma.

Graphical Abstract

Neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI), are accompanied with cognitive impairment originated from vascular or nonvascular effects. While consequences of physical trauma of brain tissue is considered, the main emphases are on effects triggered by vascular dysfunction. Extravascular formation of fibrinogen (Fg)-beta amyloid and Fg-cellular prion protein complexes through tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling can cause neurodegeneration leading to memory decline during TBI.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is a neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disease, results from injury caused by mechanical forces as a result of an object striking the head and/or from rapid acceleration and deceleration caused by vigorous head movement that lead to brain tissue deformation within the skull. These forces produce a primary injury that directly affect neurons, blood vessels and astrocytes, trigger early ionic, metabolic and neurotransmitter changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, free radical production, and initiate a cascade of secondary processes that result in complex cellular, inflammatory, neurochemical and metabolic alterations (Davis; Giza &amp; Hovda, 2001; Werner &amp; Engelhard, 2007). Secondary injury can develop within days or month or years after the primary injury and leads to inflammatory changes associated with impaired cerebral blood flow, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, edema, increased intracranial pressure, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, calcium influx, elevated oxidative stress, axonal injury and cell death (Davis; Giza &amp; Hovda, 2001; Werner &amp; Engelhard, 2007). Brain vasculature is the main factor that is involved in this process. It is known that the vascular tone of brain arterioles is chiefly regulated by signals derived from neurons, smaller arterioles, and astrocytes that encase much of the luminal surface of brain vessels (Filosa &amp; Iddings, 2013). On the other hand, abnormalities in small vessels affect neuronal function, which may also occur via astrocytes that are located between the vessels and neurons. Therefore, these effects we call vasculo-neuronal effects. Although there is an increasing evidence that vascular dysfunction can result in cognitive impairment during various pathologies (Gorelick Philip et al., 2011; Sagare et al., 2012; 2013; Murphy et al., 2016), the precise mechanisms of disruption of vasculo-neuronal interactions are still not clear.

In modern cognitive psychology there is an assumption that there are separate long- and short-term memory (LTM and STM, respectively) systems and STM (visual, spatial, and a phonological stores) is distinctly different from LTM (Norris, 2017). Impairment in STM is one of the major problems of people with head injury (Cernich et al., 2010). Transient long-term and longer lasting STM deficits occur during mild TBI (Gorman et al., 1993). STM impairments persist longer in patients with mild to moderate TBI (Chuah et al., 2004). The main goal of this article is to discuss STM reduction during mild to moderate TBI highlighting not so much molecular mechanisms but distinctions between the mechanisms originated in vasculature from those triggered in non-vascular tissue. We mainly consider conditions when changes in BBB permeability are caused by chronic inflammatory processes and not by mechanical rupture of vessels, which is typical for a severe TBI and is associated with hemorrhage. During TBI-induced inflammation, increased BBB permeability of non-ruptured vessels still causes extravasation of blood plasma high molecular weight proteins, for example albumin and fibrinogen (Fg) (Muradashvili et al., 2012b; Muradashvili &amp; Lominadze, 2013; Muradashvili et al., 2014a) and their deposition in sub-endothelial matrix (SEM) and interstitium (Lominadze et al., 2010; Muradashvili et al., 2014a; Muradashvili et al., 2017). These depositions can cause changes in astrocyte function and result in neurodegeneration and reduction in STM (visual and spatial memory) (Sahni et al., 2009; Muradashvili &amp; Lominadze, 2013; Muradashvili et al., 2017). Thus, there can be two sources that can contribute to neuronal dysfunction and/or neurodegeneration: a) vasculature, which includes all effects that are originated from blood vessels and b) cerebral extravascular tissue. Collectively, effects originated from these sources cause functional and morphological alterations that can alter balance of neurotransmitter homeostasis, synaptic connections, cause potential axonal degeneration and neuronal death and can lead to memory impairment (Sajja et al., 2016). Understanding of these processes that are triggered from vascular or non-vascular parts of the brain at the cellular and molecular level may provide clues to STM deficits during mild TBI.

In the central nervous system (CNS), information processing, including memory formation, was believed to be primarily a neuronal function. In recent years, however, considerable evidence has been accumulated that shows that astroglial cells, which comprise about 50% of brain play a critical role in memory processing through their interactions with neurons in the regulation of the cellular microenvironment, in neurotransmitter and neuromodulator recycling, energy metabolism and maintaining osmotic balance and optimal ionic conditions for neurons (Sajja et al., 2016). As astrocytes are the main connective components between the vessels and neurons, effects of astrocytes on STM changes may be determined by molecules extravasated from brain vessels due to an increased cerebrovascular permeability. The disruption of vascular wall integrity caused by inflammation subsequent to primary injury allows plasma proteins to enter CNS parenchyma. These proteins have the ability to activate astrocytes and microglia, which are the integral components of the neuro-vascular unit (NVU) (Chodobski et al., 2011; Muradashvili &amp; Lominadze, 2013) and may lead to neurodegeneration resulting in STM reduction. Similarly, inflammation-mediated activation of neurons can affect astrocyte function releasing vasoactive molecules (Filosa &amp; Iddings, 2013). Thus, both vascular and non-vascular effects involve astrocyte activation (e.g. retraction of processes and overexpression of inflammatory markers) and dysfunction (release of vasoactive and neurodegenerative signals) that affect vessels and neurons eventually resulting in neurodegeneration and memory reduction.

Cerebral Blood Flow

Although many patients with TBI appear to have recovered completely still maintain postconcussive symptoms such as deficits in cognitive and executive function and reduced cerebral blood flow (Satoshi et al., 2018). TBI impairs the capability of cerebral vessels to dilate (thus to decrease cerebrovascular resistance) when systemic blood pressure drops (Toth et al., 2016). Thus, it is possible that memory impairment during TBI could be in part due to reduced cerebrovascular autoregulation. Impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation is associated with increased production of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) (Armstead et al., 2013). In addition, ET-1 antagonizes NMDA receptor-mediated vasodilation (Armstead, 2001) leading to cerebral hypoperfusion. We have shown that increased blood content of Fg results in increased production of endothelial ET-1 (Sen et al., 2009). Therefore, since TBI is an inflammatory disease and blood level of Fg increases during inflammation in general (Ross, 1999) and during TBI in particular (Chhabra et al., 2010; Pahatouridis et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Muradashvili et al., 2015), enhanced binding of Fg to vascular endothelium and the resultant production of ET-1 can be one of the possible mechanisms of cerebral blood flow reduction during TBI. Thus, impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation and hypoperfusion can be triggering mechanisms of vascular origin that could result in neuronal dysfunction during TBI. However, neurons within the subcortical brain regions control local blood flow by releasing neurotransmitters and by causing constriction or dilation, thereby regulate local blood flow according to neuronal demand (Drake &amp; Iadecola, 2007; Cipolla, 2009). Since it is known that astrocytes can release vasoactive factors (Murphy et al., 1994), astrocytes along with neurons can also be involved in regulation of cerebral blood flow during TBI.

Endothelial cells/BBB

There is a growing evidence that disruption of BBB is the one of the most important factors of TBI consequences (Chodobski et al., 2011; Alves, 2014). BBB is formed by tightly connected cerebrovascular endothelial cells (ECs) and its normal function depends on paracrine interaction between the endothelium and astrocytes. BBB creates highly restricted environment to blood-borne factors (Chodobski et al., 2011). There is both immediate (due to tissue damage and acute inflammation) and delayed (mainly result of chronic inflammation) disruption of BBB during TBI. Endothelial dysfunction because of acute inflammation contributes to systemic complications after head injury (Villalba et al., 2017). The disruption of tight junctions and basement membrane causes increased paracellular permeability (Mehta &amp; Malik, 2006; Komarova &amp; Malik, 2010). It was shown that targeting endothelial ion transporters is neuroprotective after cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (O’Donnell, 2014). The authors clearly demonstrated that the secretion of Na+ from blood into brain is the driving force for increased brain water. Thus, changes in function of ion transporters can mainly affect water transport and by resulting in edema, may impair neuronal function making the effect of endothelial ion transporters on cognition of vascular origin.

Injury also causes oxidative stress, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of cell adhesion molecules on ECs, which promote an influx of inflammatory cells and blood-borne proteins into the brain parenchyma (Chodobski et al., 2011; Alves, 2014). Increased cerebrovascular permeability causes extravasation of plasma proteins resulting in vasogenic edema. Changes in cell metabolism also cause cytotoxic edema of ECs and astrocytes (Chodobski et al., 2011). On the other hand, later effects (14 days after injury) of mild to moderate TBI are systemic inflammation and the resultant increase in cerebrovascular permeability to blood proteins mainly via caveolar transcytosis (Muradashvili &amp; Lominadze, 2013; Muradashvili et al., 2015; Muradashvili et al., 2017). Combined, these vascular changes start the cascade, which leads to neurodegeneration and the resultant memory loss after head trauma. Most of the effects originated in ECs reach neurons via astrocytes. Since the impairment of BBB is a result of systemic inflammation, this process may take place in microvessels of the whole brain.

Glial cells

Effect of glial cells itself on memory reduction during TBI is a non-vascular event. However, their activation can be a result of both vascular and non-vascular origin. Some studies show that glial cells can be activated by cytokines produced locally after inflammation or by substances released by damaged endothelial and neuronal cells (Sofroniew &amp; Vinters, 2010). On the other hand, proteins that extravasate through vascular wall to the interstitium may also activate astroglial cells resulting in changes of their shape, retraction of processes, and function (Schachtrup et al., 2010; Muradashvili et al., 2017).

Microglia

Microglia have a variety of functions in the brain, including synaptic plasticity and CNS repair. Microglia rapidly become activated in response to CNS damage. Depending on the nature of the stimulus, microglia can take a number of activation states, which correspond to altered microglia morphology, gene expression and function. It has been reported that early microglia activation following traumatic head injury may contribute to the restoration of homeostasis in the brain (Kettenmann et al., 2013; Donat et al., 2017). On the other hand, if they remain chronically activated, such cells display a classically activated phenotype, releasing pro-inflammatory molecules, resulting in further tissue damage and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration and memory reduction (Kettenmann et al., 2013; Donat et al., 2017).

Astrocytes

There are strong interactions between astrocytes and neurons and it is known that astrocytes play an important role in learning and memory (Ota et al., 2013). Astrocytes can be considered part of BBB as they tightly surround brain microvessels. Therefore, they play significant role in regulation and maintenance of BBB (Abbott, 2002; Chodobski et al., 2011; Alves, 2014) and usually, together with vessels, considered as a part of gliovascular unit (Abbott, 2002). Their effects on neurons can be considered both as vascular and nonvascular nature (Bélanger et al., 2011).

Astrocytes have a key role in various functions of the CNS, including glutamate, ion and water homeostasis, defense against oxidative stress, energy storage (in the form of glycogen), tissue repair, and modulation of synaptic activity through release of gliotransmitters (Bélanger &amp; Magistretti, 2009). One of the best-characterized functions of astrocytes is the rapid removal of neurotransmitters released into the synaptic cleft to maintain neuronal excitability. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Overstimulation of glutamate receptors is highly toxic to neurons (a phenomenon called excitotoxicity). Glutamate uptake mainly occurs via the astrocyte-specific sodium-dependent high-affinity glutamate transporters glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (Bak et al., 2006).

Astrocytes have neuroprotective actions that occurs by enhancing the exchange of energy substrates between astrocytes and neurons (Bélanger et al., 2011). Astrocytes store energy in the form of glycogen derived from glucose that is uptaken through glucose transporter 1 (Magistretti, 2008; Bélanger et al., 2011). This can result in increased defense ability of astrocytes against the oxidative stress (Bliss et al., 2004; Shih et al., 2006). Furthermore, enhanced lactate shuttling between astrocytes and neurons via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) in astrocytes and MCT-2 in neurons may result in increased protection against neuronal excitotoxicity (Bliss et al., 2004; Pellerin et al., 2007; Bélanger et al., 2011). Under normal conditions, astrocytes are responsible for removal of excess glutamate. Several in vivo and in vitro studies show the importance of astrocytic glutamate uptake in preventing glutamate induced cytotoxicity (Rosenberg &amp; Aizenman, 1989; Bélanger &amp; Magistretti, 2009). Experiments demonstrated that inhibition of glutamate transporter 1 increases neurotoxicity (Tanaka et al., 1997).

Although astrocytes can increase release of their lactate during TBI, the possible benefit of this release may be questionable, since neurons reduce their ability of taking up the lactate depending on their level of damage (Lama et al., 2014). Glutamate-induced activation of glycolysis stimulates lactate production from glucose in astrocytes, with subsequent lactate transfer to neurons. The increase of glutamate release in the neuronal synapse following TBI stimulates astrocytic glycolysis and blood glucose uptake (Patet et al., 2016). Therefore, this process would be more efficient in places with good blood supply. Glutamate also activates intracellular Ca2+ elevation, which stimulates arachidonic acid and prostaglandin production that act on cerebral vessel tone to supply adequate nutrients (Attwell et al., 2010). Overall, considering the pivotal role of astrocytes in brain homeostasis and the strong metabolic interaction between astrocytes and neurons, it is possible, that astrocytic dysfunction might contribute to neurodegenerative processes (Bélanger &amp; Magistretti, 2009; Allaman et al., 2011) and thus memory reduction after brain injury.

After an insult, astrocytes become activated that is defined by their shape change and retraction of processes resulting in disconnect from vessels and neurons. Activation of astrocytes during TBI can be due to molecules coming from vasculature as well as form neuronal and glial cells (Sofroniew &amp; Vinters, 2010). Activated astrocytes release a wide array of mediators, including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, neurotrophic factors, chemokines, complement factors, and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Allaman et al., 2011; Bélanger et al., 2011). These processes cause alterations in astrocyte-neuronal interactions, which might lead to neuronal damage (Allaman et al., 2011). While astrocyte activation is initiated immediately upon injury, it is often sustained chronically which is linked to damaging neuronal homeostasis and memory deficits (Faden &amp; Loane, 2015). In addition, astrocyte reactivity or astrogliosis forms astrocyte scar which inhibits axonal regrowth as they secrete cell growth inhibitors, such as transforming growth factor-β, thus affecting long-term cognitive outcomes (Smith et al., 1997).

Astrocytes play an important role in synaptic transmission (Sofroniew &amp; Vinters, 2010), long term potentiation (LTP), synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Shleper et al., 2005; Henneberger et al., 2010; Ota et al., 2013). They release glutamate, ATP and cytokines that affect newly formed connections. The most important is regulation of glutamate. Astrocytes maintain neurotransmitter pool of glutamate and are able to synchronize its release with neuronal activity and subsequently regulate transmission of glutamate between neurons (Angulo et al., 2004; Amiri et al., 2012; Amiri et al., 2013). Astrocytic glutamate release activates presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and promotes increased excitatory communication between neurons (Jourdain et al., 2007). These NMDA receptors are also subjected to further regulation by endogenous concentrations of D-serine, which serves as a co-agonist, specifically in the hippocampal region, suggesting its potential importance in new (learning) memory (a type of STM) formation (Shleper et al., 2005; Henneberger et al., 2010). Postsynaptic glutamate receptors, particularly α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors depend on signaling by ATP synthesized in astrocytes (Ota et al., 2013). Cytokine signaling is also implicated in regulation of LTP and it is especially important in plasticity after injury (Ota et al., 2013). On the other hand, glucose that is derived from astrocytes is involved in LTM formation (Ng, 1997). It is also a source for glycogen (Bélanger et al., 2011), which is derived from lactate and also participates in memory consolidation (Steinman et al., 2016). Since these metabolic processes can be disrupted during TBI (Jalloh et al., 2015), it is possible this can lead to memory reduction.

The involvement of astrocytes in synaptic regulation or metabolic interaction with neurons can be considered as non-vascular effects. However, when astrocytes are activated and their function is changed by factors derived from both vasculature and brain parenchymal tissue, we can consider astrocyte-mediated memory reduction as both vascular and non-vascular origin.

Although it is known how astrocytes regulate the postsynaptic neuron and LTM formation, effect of astrocytes on activity of the presynaptic neurons should also be considered. Hippocampal astrocytes are able to detect synaptic activity at distinct locations via metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and increase intracellular Ca2+ levels for a prolonged time resulting in alteration of basal synaptic transmission (Di Castro et al., 2011). Calcium activity was also observed to be involved in neurotransmission. Synaptic transmission in neighboring synapses was reduced by blocking Ca2+ in astrocytes, suggesting the ability of astrocytes to modulate the activity of presynaptic neurons (Ota et al., 2013). It is known that presynaptic neurons are more involved in STM rather than in LTM formation and mild to moderate TBI induces STM reduction (Gorman et al., 1993) that persists longer in patients than changes in LTM (Chuah et al., 2004). Therefore, the effect of astrocytes discussed above can be a possible mechanism for STM reduction during mild TBI. Thus, as astrocytes locate between the vessels and neurons, practically any effect originated in vessels that results in astrocyte activation (e.g. retraction of processes or detachment from vessels) affects neurons leading to neurodegeneration and the resultant reduction in STM. The same is true if astrocytes are activated by effects originated from neurons. This would still result in neurodegeneration. As we mentioned above (in Endothelial cells/BBB), since the activation of astrocytes can be a result of systemic inflammation, it may not be restricted to regions involved in memory, but would occur throughout the brain wherever there is TBI-induced inflammation. In fact, it is very likely that similar impairments of non-memory related functions could occur in other brain regions due to activation of astrocytes.

Oligodendrocytes

Many of the late-onset pathological features of TBI are directly related to aberrant axonal functioning, and result in progressive atrophy of white matter tracts in the brain (Bramlett &amp; Dietrich, 2002). Injury-induced white matter degeneration has been found along with persistent inflammation (Johnson et al., 2013), myelin breakdown (Flygt et al., 2013), and the axonal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and caspase-3 (Chen et al., 2004). Oligodendrocytes play a major role in maintaining axonal health in the adult CNS, they provide support to axons with the production of the myelin sheath, which is vital for fast impulse conduction (Armstrong et al., 2016) and required for higher order brain functions like learning and memory formation (Dent et al., 2015; Sajja et al., 2016). These cells are extremely vulnerable to damage and death under pathological conditions such as TBI. Effects may exert through excitotoxicity from the uncontrolled release of glutamate and ATP (Palmer et al., 1993), oxidative injury (Thorburne &amp; Juurlink, 1996; Hsiao et al., 2013) and released cytokines (Jurewicz et al., 2005). Oligodendrocyte death causes demyelination, impairment of axonal conduction, and changes in synaptic plasticity and ultimately axonal death, which contribute to memory impairment (Armstrong et al., 2016; Sajja et al., 2016). Although these effects can be triggered by vascular dysfunction, changes in oligodendrocyte function mostly occur via direct impact and systemic inflammation.

Molecules involved in both vascular and non-vascular mediated memory reduction during TBI:

Amyloid

Trauma to the CNS is one of the most common risk factors that can initiate molecular cascades resulting in development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. TBI can be a predisposing factor for AD, and recurrent TBI in career boxers may cause a progressive memory disorder associated with AD-like brain pathology known as dementia pugilistica (DP), so called “boxer’s dementia” (Sundman et al., 2014). There is an epidemiological evidence that TBI may result in development of AD later in life (Schofield et al., 1997; Guo et al., 2000; Plassman et al., 2000; Fleminger et al., 2003), and some studies have shown that Aβ plaques also start to accumulate in brain during TBI within hours following injury (Johnson et al., 2010). The main pathophysiological link between TBI and AD is the production, accumulation and clearance of Aβ peptides (Johnson et al., 2010). In AD, the primary mechanism for production of Aβ peptides is transmembrane cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by α-, β-, and γ-secretases (Nunan &amp; Small, 2000; Selkoe &amp; Wolfe, 2000). Diffuse axonal injury which is one of the most common pathology of TBI-induced disruption of cytoskeletal elements causes impaired axonal APP transport and its accumulation (Xia, 2010), which can be converted to Aβ (Lambri et al., 2001; Gorrie et al., 2002; Reichard et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004). It has been shown that enzymes such as β-site APP-cleaving enzyme, presenilin-1 and caspase-3, necessary for Aβ cleavage also accumulate in axons during TBI (Chen et al., 2004). The abnormal concentration of these enzymes also increase the probability of Aβ formation in vicinity of the axonal membrane (Chen et al., 2004). Some studies showed that axonal lysis and breakdown is also a source of Aβ, which after expulsion accumulates in parenchyma and causes plaque formation (Smith et al., 1999; Chen et al., 2004). There is a possibility that increased APP production during TBI causes saturation of α-secretase processing pathway and increase in β-secretase processing resulting in Aβ accumulation (Gentleman et al., 1993; Graham et al., 1996). It seems that trauma creates a unique condition where all substrates that are necessary for Aβ formation coexist.

Accumulation of Aβ causes synaptic dysfunction, it can also bind to several receptors on neurons and elicit neurotoxicity (Kam et al., 2014; Rajmohan &amp; Reddy, 2017). Various studies have shown that accumulated Aβ reduces glutamatergic synaptic transmission strength and plasticity. This decreases number of AMPA receptors (Liu et al., 2010). In general, the overall expression level of NMDA receptors in AD is reduced (Hynd et al., 2004). It was suggested that this effect reflects compensatory reactions (Danysz &amp; Parsons, 2012). However, decreased levels of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) can be a result of Aβ accumulation (Shankar et al., 2007) leading to suppression of LTP (Chen et al., 2000). Aβ also causes gamma aminobutyric acid-ergic dysfunction, which may contribute to the development of aberrant synchrony in neural network (Li et al., 2016), disruption of cognitive functions (Palop &amp; Mucke, 2010) and memory reduction (Xia, 2010).

Although it is believed that Aβ is derived from brain tissue itself, there are various evidences that underline the vascular effect in amyloid deposition in brain. It is known that Aβ is generated in both brain and peripheral tissues and it is circulated in blood (Evin et al., 2003), where its level is correlated with increased risk of AD development (van Oijen et al., 2006; Graff-Radford et al., 2007; Schupf et al., 2008). Studies showed that blood-derived Aβ can enter the brain and induce neuronal dysfunction (Zlokovic, 2005; Bu et al., 2017). Transport of Aβ through BBB has major role in accumulation of Aβ in CNS (Deane et al., 2003). It regulates entry of blood derived Aβ in extracellular space (Zlokovic et al., 1993) and clears brain derived Aβ (Shibata et al., 2000). There is also an evidence that Aβ accumulation itself affects brain vasculature and changes function of NVU (Zlokovic, 2005). This suggests that Aβ can be involved in reduction of memory during TBI via mechanisms initiated from both vasculature and non-vascular tissue.

Tau protein

Tau proteins belong to brain microtubule-associated proteins. Normal tau binds to tubulin, promotes its assembly in microtubules and stabilizes it (Mietelska-Porowska et al., 2014). TBI is associated with increased tau protein phosphorylation (Kane et al., 2012; Walker &amp; Tesco, 2013). Hyperphosphorylated tau binds to normal tau proteins instead of tubulin, aggregates and forms neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (Iqbal et al., 2013; Mietelska-Porowska et al., 2014). The production of NFT is correlated with memory reduction and cognitive decline in AD (Wilcock &amp; Esiri, 1982; Guillozet et al., 2003; Roberson et al., 2007). Studies showed that the same tau epitopes accumulate in DP as a result of severe TBI (Hof et al., 1992; Rubenstein et al., 2017). Dysfunctional tau protein contributes to cytoskeletal collapse, impaired movement of anterograde and retrograde movement of proteins, compromises synaptic transmission and interneuronal signaling (Mietelska-Porowska et al., 2014). One mechanism of increased tau phosphorylation during TBI is activation of Calpain (Walker &amp; Tesco, 2013). Calpain is the protein that cleaves and activates number of kinases, including those involved in tau phosphorylation (Walker &amp; Tesco, 2013). TBI causes Aβ-PrPC-Fyn kinase activation, which also induces tau phosphorylation (Rubenstein et al., 2017). Fyn kinase is localized in postsynaptic density of the brain, which is the primary site of signal transduction and processing, and its activity is linked to synaptic function (Nygaard et al., 2014; Kaufman et al., 2015).

Tau protein by itself is a non-vascular part of the brain. Therefore, its involvement in memory reduction during TBI can be considered as non-vascular effect. However, the mechanisms and factors that induce tau phosphorylation and then NFT formation can be both vascular and non-vascular.

Prion

It has been indicated that cellular prion protein (PrPC) can have a greater role in memory reduction than Aβ (Chung et al., 2010; Gimbel et al., 2010). Studies have shown that PrPC is involved in TBI associated memory reduction (Rubenstein et al., 2017). PrPC is a cell surface, glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein, abundantly expressed in the nervous system: neurons, glial (Westergard et al., 2007) and endothelial (Starke et al., 2002) cells. Currently, PrPC has been implicated in several distinct cellular phenomena, such as neurogenesis and neural differentiation, as well as protection against both oxidative stress and apoptosis (Hetz et al.; Westergard et al., 2007). There is also a direct evidence implicating PrPC in synapse development and modulation. PrPC induces rapid polarization of hippocampal neurons in vitro and modulates synaptic transmission (Kanaani et al., 2005). Infusion of antibodies against PrPC impaired both STM and LTM (Coitinho et al., 2007). Since PrPC interactions seem to be essential to many biological phenomena related to cell signaling, neural plasticity and memory consolidation, it is not surprising that alterations in this protein should affect cognitive processes and result in memory reduction (Fischer et al., 2000; Coitinho et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2010).

It has been shown that PrPC functions as a high-affinity receptor for Aβo and is also required for Aβo inhibition of hippocampal LTP (Lauren et al., 2009). This suggests that PrPC is required for the pathological effects of Aβo, such as inhibition of synaptic plasticity (Lauren et al., 2009; Um et al., 2012; Zhou &amp; Liu, 2013). Some studies have shown that Fyn kinase plays an important role in linking the Aβo and PrPC interaction to disturbances in neuronal function (Um et al., 2012). The connection between Aβo- PrPC complexes at the cell surface and the intracellular Fyn kinase has been shown to require the mGluR5 (Um et al., 2013). Taken together, the extracellular Aβo triggers neuronal signal transduction from PrPC to mGluR5 to Fyn kinase (Um et al., 2012; Um et al., 2013; Kaufman et al., 2015). A reduction of Fyn kinase function alleviates AD-related phenotypes in transgenic mice and the Aβo-PrPC-Fyn pathway has been shown to be relevant to AD in humans (Chin et al., 2005; Kaufman et al., 2015). Fyn regulates glutamate receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity by phosphorylating NMDA-R (Trepanier et al., 2012; Lussier et al., 2015) that play an important role in learning and memory (Nakazawa et al., 2001; Massey et al., 2004; Prybylowski et al., 2005).

It was shown that PrPC participates in Aβ transcytosis across BBB (Pflanzner et al., 2012) and Aβ-mediated memory reduction during TBI (Gimbel et al., 2010). Increased extravascular deposition of PrPC in mouse brain during mild to moderate TBI was accompanied by STM reduction (Muradashvili et al., 2015). Combined, these results indicate that PrPC alone as well as its possible association with Aβ can have a role in memory reduction during inflammatory cerebrovascular diseases.

It has been shown that PrPC is increased in blood during TBI (Pham et al., 2015a; Pham et al., 2015b). Therefore, formation of PrPC aggregates in extravascular space during TBI can be a result of leaking of this plasma protein through the impaired vascular wall. Thus, we can classify PrPC-associated effects as vascular effects. On the other hand as it is also expressed on non-vascular parts of brain, it is possible that PrPC, which forms toxic aggregates during TBI can also be generated from these cells and its effects can be considered as non-vascular origin.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and tropomyosin receptor kinase B

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important mediator for neuronal survival, function, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory (Korte et al., 1995; Lu; Bramham &amp; Messaoudi, 2005; Bekinschtein et al., 2008; Cunha et al., 2010; Boots et al., 2017). BDNF is secreted in non-vascular part of the brain in cells as neurons (Leßmann &amp; Brigadski, 2009) and astrocytes (Fulmer et al., 2014) and can also be secreted from vascular ECs (Wang et al., 2006) as well. It is also found in blood (Klein et al., 2011). BDNF signaling is mediated by the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), also known as tyrosine receptor kinase B or by p75NTR-TrkB receptor heterodimers (Baxter et al., 1997; Minichiello, 2009). TrkB receptors have been found in axons, nerve terminals and dendritic spines (and to a lesser extent in the cell bodies) of glutamatergic pyramidal and granule cells in the rat hippocampus (Drake et al., 1999), as well as in the dendritic spines of neurons in the rat cerebral cortex (Aoki et al., 2000). TrkB receptors are expressed in astrocytes (Wang et al., 1998) and in cardiac microvascular ECs (Bai Xinlei et al., 2014).

BDNF and TrkB modulate synaptic transmission through both presynaptic and postsynaptic modifications (Poo, 2001; Tyler et al., 2002). Although it is known that TrkB is dysregulated during TBI (Michelle et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2017), there are some possible mechanisms of BDNF-TrkB mediated memory effect including postsynaptic activation of TrkB receptors inducing phosphorylation-mediated hyperactivation NMDA receptor and increase its opening probability (Levine et al., 1998). BDNF-TrkB can induce cation influx through canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels (Li et al.; Amaral &amp; Pozzo-Miller, 2007). In this case, activation of TrkB and phospholipase Cγ leads to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-dependent Ca2+store depletion, which activates influx of Ca2+ and Na+ through TRPC3, altering membrane potentials that might, in turn, facilitate synaptic Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated channels or NMDARs. The latter activates α-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II that leads to the induction and expression of LTP through positive regulation of NMDARs and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors, respectively. In addition, BDNF-TrkB modulates AMPAR expression and trafficking (Caldeira Margarida et al., 2007). These findings suggest that interaction between BDNF-TrkB and the synaptic machinery underline their effects on LTP and memory.

During moderate to severe TBI levels of extracellular glutamate are increased (Guerriero et al., 2015; Dorsett et al., 2017), leading to enhanced calcium influx through hyperactivation of NMDARs, resulting in calcium overload and neurodegeneration due to excitotoxicity (Hardingham, 2009). It is noteworthy to mention that contradictory effect of NMDARs can be explained by the classical bell-shaped curve model of the neuronal response to NMDA or glutamate contents: modest or physiological NMDAR activity can promote neuroprotection, whereas too little activation or hyperactivation of NMDAR promotes cell death (Hardingham, 2009). At synapses, the activation of NMDARs has been shown to promote release of BDNF (Kolarow et al., 2007; Marshall et al., 2017) . It is also known that stimulation of astrocytes by BDNF and interleukin-1 can cause TrkB-mediated nitric oxide production and neurodegeneration via formation of ROS (Colombo et al., 2012). This means that BDNF-TrkB mediated memory reduction during TBI can be a result of either changes in synaptic plasticity or neurodegeneration. Thus, the neuromodulating effects mediated by BDNF can be of both vascular and non-vascular origin.

Fibrinogen

High blood level of Fg, called hiperfibrinogenemia (HFg), is a marker of inflammation (Ross, 1999) and it can also a cause of inflammatory responses (Kerlin et al., 2004; Tyagi et al., 2008; Patibandla et al., 2009; Muradashvili et al., 2011; Muradashvili et al., 2012a). HFg (e.g. ≥ 4±0.1 mg/ml of plasma during inflammation vs.~2±0.1 mg/ml in normal plasma (Letcher et al., 1981)), accompanies inflammatory diseases such as stroke (D’Erasmo et al., 1993; del Zoppo et al., 2009), hypertension (Letcher et al., 1981; Lominadze et al., 1998), diabetes (Lee et al., 2007) and TBI (Chhabra et al., 2010; Pahatouridis et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Muradashvili et al., 2015). It has been found that blood content of Fg increases after local vascular injury (del Zoppo et al., 2009) and particularly after TBI (Chhabra et al., 2010; Pahatouridis et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Muradashvili et al., 2015). As HFg can lead to an increased cerebrovascular permeability (Muradashvili et al., 2016) it has been found to be associated with its increased deposition in extravascular space after cortical contusion injury in mice (Muradashvili et al., 2015; Muradashvili et al., 2017). At an elevated level, Fg itself can increase cerebrovascular permeability (Muradashvili et al., 2012a; Muradashvili et al., 2016) and present a significant destructive effect as it remains elevated for more than 20 days after inflammatory insult (Gabay &amp; Kushner, 1999).

Fg/fibrin-containing plaque formations are the hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases associated with memory impairment such as AD (Ahn et al., 2010), multiple sclerosis (Vos et al., 2005) and TBI (Johnson et al., 2010). A significant contribution of Fg in development of AD has been shown (Cortes-Canteli &amp; Strickland, 2009; Ahn et al., 2010; Cortes-Canteli et al., 2010). Fibrin deposits were found many years after head injury in humans (Hay et al., 2015; Jenkins et al., 2018). Gradual deposition of Fg accelerates neurovascular damage and promotes neuroinflammation (Paul et al., 2007; Hay et al., 2015).

Impaired memory, particularly STM, is one of the universal problems of people with the head injury (Cernich et al., 2010). Although Fg and Aβ (Cleary et al., 2005) plaque formation is the hallmark of AD (Cortes-Canteli &amp; Strickland, 2009; Ahn et al., 2010; Cortes-Canteli et al., 2010), mechanisms of its formation and deposition in SEM and extravascular space are not clear. It has been shown that Aβ mediates formation of clots with abnormal structure and resistance to fibrinolysis (Zamolodchikov &amp; Strickland, 2012). However, some studies showed that deposited Aβ alone has limited effect on memory (Chung et al., 2010; Gimbel et al., 2010). These results suggest that formation of Aβ complexes such as Fg-Aβ complex or Aβ-PrPC can have a greater effect on reduction of memory than deposition Aβ alone. This may be an explanation for recovery of STM within few months in majority of patients with mild TBI (Carroll et al., 2004). Even though, accumulated Aβ has neurotoxic effect it may still degrade eventually if it is not in a complex with Fg (Cortes-Canteli &amp; Strickland, 2009; Zamolodchikov &amp; Strickland, 2012).

The role of Fg in formation of the Fg-Aβ complex (Muradashvili et al., 2014b) can be a major indicator for reduction of STM (visual and spatial) during TBI (Muradashvili &amp; Lominadze, 2013). In addition, it has been shown that the immobilized Fg can be associated with PrPC forming a Fg-PrPC complex (Muradashvili et al., 2015; Muradashvili et al., 2016), which can be highly resistant to degradation (Ahn et al., 2010; Zamolodchikov &amp; Strickland, 2012) and could lead to formation of protein plaques. Increased formation of Fg-PrPC complex in mice during TBI was accompanied by reduction in STM (visual and spatial) (Muradashvili et al., 2015). As Fg deposits form mainly between vessels and astrocytes, Fg/fibrin-containing protein complex formations can only be initiated in the vasculo-astrocyte endfeet interface and therefore, these complexes do not have a direct interaction (at least initially) with neurons (Muradashvili et al., 2017). The presence of Fg in the extravascular space, and particularly between the vessel and astrocyte endfeet, causes vasculo-astrocyte physical and, apparently, functional uncoupling (Muradashvili et al., 2017). In turn, this vasculo-astrocyte uncoupling can cause neuronal degeneration and result in STM (visual and spatial) reduction seen in mice during mild to moderate TBI (Muradashvili et al., 2017). Therapeutically targeting enhanced cerebrovascular permeability to diminish the formation of the Fg/fibrin-containing complex seems to be appropriate step after inflammatory cerebrovascular diseases resulting in cognitive impairment. As Fg is synthesized only in hepatocytes and present in blood, it can be found in extravascular space only if it extravasates in brain parenchyma due to an increased vascular permeability (Muradashvili &amp; Lominadze, 2013). Therefore, we consider effects of Fg on memory loss during TBI as of vascular origin.

Based on above discussion, we think that memory recovery function can dependent on the severity of trauma as well as on brain region that was injured. Region of the brain damage can have some importance. For example, if hippocampus is affected by TBI formation of Fg-Ab complexes may occur there faster resulting in faster reduction in short-term memory. However, since TBI is an inflammatory disease, regardless of impacted region, Fg-Ab complex may eventually be formed in hippocampus.

Conclusion

Thus, TBI that is associated with STM reduction can be a result of vascular and non-vascular effects. Physical impact can directly affect vessels, neurons, and astroglia, which reside in vascular and neuronal interface and present a contact element between the two. Damage of vessels results in inflammatory responses such as in vascular reactivity, permeability, blood flow, and O2 exchange. As a result, overexpression and extravasation of blood proteins such as Fg, Aβ, PrPC, BDNF/TrkB and possibly other proteins occurs. In Addition, at elevated level Fg can itself increase vascular permeability. These changes affect function of astroglia, which in turn affect neuronal function. Direct damage of neurons results in overexpression of Aβ, PrPC, BDNF/TrkB, and Tau proteins resulting in synaptic changes and neurodegeneration causing reduction in memory. On other hand, changes in neuronal function affect astroglia, which alter vascular function and trigger effects in vasculature defined above. Trauma induced direct damage of astroglia affects both vessels and neurons resulting in changes defined for each (see above). Thus, physical damage and the resultant inflammation affects vessels, astroglia, and neurons resulting in neuronal degeneration and subsequently causing in short-term memory reduction (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Possible vascular and neuronal effects on short-term memory (STM) during traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Mild to moderate TBI triggers cascades of cellular and molecular changes, which directly and indirectly affect STM. The injury can directly damage neurons, vessels and astrocytes. It can also cause inflammation. Inflammatory mediators can affect neurons, activate astrocytes, increase cerebrovascular permeability, and cause extravasation of plasma proteins and their deposition in extravascular space leading to cascade of further inflammatory processes. These processes are interconnected and influence each other leading to STM impairment during TBI.

The diagram shows a possible functional interactions between effects originated from vessels, neurons and astrocytes during TBI. Thus, TBI-induced STM reduction can be a result of vascular and non-vascular effects. Damage of vessels results in inflammatory responses such as in vascular reactivity, permeability, blood flow, and O2 exchange. As a result, overexpression and extravasation of blood proteins such as Fg, Aβ, PrPC, BDNF/TrkB and possibly other proteins can occur. In Addition, at elevated level Fg can itself increase vascular permeability. These changes activate astrocytes and affect their function, in turn affecting neuronal function. Direct damage of neurons results in overexpression of Aβ, PrPC, BDNF/TrkB, and Tau proteins resulting in synaptic changes and neurodegeneration causing reduction in memory. On other hand, changes in neuronal function affect astrocytes. Activated astrocytes affect vascular function and trigger effects in vasculature defined above. Trauma-induced direct damage of astrocytes affects both vessels and neurons resulting in changes defined for each of them individually (see above). Thus, physical damage and the resultant inflammation affects vessels, astrocytes, and neurons resulting in neuronal degeneration and subsequently causing in STM reduction.
