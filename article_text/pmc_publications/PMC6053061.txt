Background

Positron emission tomography ligands are now available that bind to tau proteins in the brain, providing the exciting opportunity to assess the presence and distribution of tau in vivo in living patients.

Methods

This manuscript performed a systematic review of studies that have performed tau PET imaging in patients with parkinsonian disorders. Pubmed was searched up to November 2017, and the review included case reports and patient-control studies.

Results

Most tau-PET studies have utilized the [18F]AV-1451 ligand, with a few using the [11C]PBB3 and [18F]THK-5351 ligands. Elevated cortical tau-PET uptake has been observed in Parkinson’s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, presumed to be related to Alzheimer’s disease-related pathology. Mild patterns of tau-PET uptake have been observed in subcortical structures in progressive supranuclear palsy and subcortical structures and motor cortex in corticobasal syndrome, although discrepancy with autoradiographic studies that show lack of binding to 4-repeat tau and “off-target” binding observed in subcortical structures limits interpretation of these findings. Findings in frontotemporal dementia with tau mutations are variable, but elevated signal is most pronounced in mutations with deposition of both 3 and 4-repeat tau. Elevated tau-PET uptake has also been observed in multiple system atrophy, a synucleinopathy.

Conclusion

The value of the current generation of tau-PET ligands varies across Parkinsonian syndromes depending upon underlying variability in tau pathology and “off-target” binding. More work is needed to understand the biological basis of binding and more specific tau PET ligands are needed to study parkinsonian disorders.

INTRODUCTION

The recent development of positron emission tomography (PET) ligands that can bind to tau proteins in brain tissue have provided an exciting opportunity to assess the presence and distribution of tau pathology in patients during life. This is particularly valuable for patients with neurodegenerative diseases that are defined by the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau inclusions in the brain, i.e. tauopathies, but also for detecting mixed pathologies in a range of different neurodegenerative diseases. Primary tauopathies associated with parkinsonian syndromes include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and frontotemporal dementia with mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene. However, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that is characterized by both tau and beta-amyloid deposition can also occur in patients with parkinsonian syndromes and hence is also an important target for tau-PET imaging. Although these diseases are characterized by the presence of abnormal tau proteins, the specific tau isoforms, structure of the tau filaments, morphological characteristics of the tau inclusions and the distribution of tau pathology differ in each disease, as is detailed in Table 1. The ultimate hope is that tau-PET imaging could provide an early diagnostic biomarker of the presence of tau pathology and also provide biomarkers of disease progression which could be used as outcome measures in clinical treatment trials, particularly those assessing therapies that target tau.

A number of different tau-PET ligands have been developed1, most of which were originally developed to detect the hyperphosphorylated tau present in AD. Most of the clinical work performed so far has used the [18F]AV-1451 ligand (originally known as T807)2. Early studies showed that [18F]AV-1451 had greater selectivity for paired helical filament tau compared to beta-amyloid, and it was shown to have rapid uptake and washout, cross the blood-brain barrier and have minimal white matter binding in transgenic mice2. Two other ligands that also show high affinity for tau and have been used in clinical studies are the [18F]THK-53513 and [11C]PBB34 ligands. These ligands have shown strong binding to the tau pathology present in AD in autoradiographic studies5–8. This review will discuss findings from studies that have utilized these tau-PET ligands in patients clinically diagnosed with different parkinsonian disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), PSP syndromes, corticobasal syndrome, multiple system atrophy (MSA) and frontotemporal dementia associated with MAPT mutations. Autoradiographic studies relevant to each disease will be discussed in each section.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Literature was searched on PubMed for entries up until November 13th 2017 using search terms to capture tau PET studies (AV-1451, THK-5351, PBB3, PET) and the diseases of interest (Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, MAPT mutation, parkinsonism). Only studies published in English and that reported findings from tau PET imaging in humans were reviewed. A total of 28 manuscripts were identified in the search and fulfilled inclusion criteria (Table 2).

PARKINSON’S DISEASE AND RELATED DISORDERS

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremor, stiffness, slowness, impaired balance and shuffling gait. It is characterized neuropathologically by the deposition of alpha-synuclein-immunopositive Lewy neurites and Lewy bodies; and hence, at first glance, does not appear to be a useful target for tau-PET imaging. Autoradiographic studies have, indeed, consistently found no binding of [18F]AV-1451 to alpha-synuclein pathology in either Lewy body disease5–7 or PD7. However, patients with PD can develop cognitive impairment and dementia. Patients that develop dementia a year or more after the onset of motor symptoms are often diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), while those that develop dementia closer to the onset of motor symptoms, or before the onset of motor symptoms, are often diagnosed with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)9. Pathological studies have shown that co-existent AD pathology, characterized by both beta-amyloid and hyperphosphorylated 3R/4R tau deposition occurs in both PDD10–13 and DLB, occurring in up to 38% of PDD12 and 25% of DLB14 cases. In contrast, co-existent AD pathology is rare in PD in the absence of cognitive impairment10, 12, 14. Given the fact that the tau ligands show strong binding to the tau pathology present in AD5–8, tau-PET imaging provides a potentially valuable opportunity to detect the presence of AD-related tau pathology during life and to investigate the influence of tau pathology on disease course and patient outcomes.

Consistent with expectations from autopsy findings, tau-PET studies using [18F]AV-1451 have observed no tau uptake in the cortex or basal ganglia in patients with PD that do not have cognitive impairment15–17 (Table 2). However, it has been shown that PD patients have reduced [18F]AV-1451 uptake in the substantia nigra16, 17, a finding that has been interpreted as reflecting loss of neuromelanin due to the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons observed in PD. This hypothesis is supported by autoradiographic studies that have shown that [18F]AV-1451 binds to neuromelanin6.

In contrast, increased cortical tau-PET uptake has been observed in patients with PDD and DLB compared to healthy controls (Table 2). One study observed elevated [18F]AV-1451 uptake in inferior and lateral temporal gyri and precuneus in PD patients with cognitive impairment (PD-mild cognitive impairment and PDD) and DLB, although findings were more striking in DLB15. There was some evidence that the PD patients with cognitive impairment and DLB patients showed greater uptake in these regions compared to PD patients without cognitive impairment, although this was only observed when a partial volume correction was performed on the PET data. They also found that uptake in these regions correlated with general cognitive performance. Uptake in inferior and lateral temporal gyri and precuneus were also elevated in DLB compared to controls in another study; although that study found that the regions of greatest uptake in DLB were actually located in the occipital lobe18 (Figure 1). The finding of tau uptake in temporal and parietal regions fits well with the typical distribution of tau deposition at autopsy in AD19, although the finding of high occipital tau uptake may suggest that the distribution of tau pathology in DLB is atypical18, as an autopsy study has found20. However, the relationship between these tau-PET findings and beta-amyloid PET findings were variable. While one of these studies did observe a correlation between severity of tau uptake and severity of beta-amyloid deposition on PET18, the other did not15. Furthermore, both studies observed patients with elevated tau uptake that did not show elevated beta-amyloid uptake15, 18 (Figure 1), suggesting that tau can accumulate in the neocortex in the absence of beta-amyloid. This contrasts to findings in AD where beta-amyloid and tau are both typically elevated. The authors conclude that it is possible that in these cases tau deposition may precede beta-amyloid deposition18, or that soluble beta-amyloid oligomers and non-fibrillar amyloid in diffuse plaques could contribute to tau accumulation in these cases15. Another possibility is that the tau-PET findings may reflect off-target binding. A further difference between these findings and those observed in AD was in the severity of tau uptake which was markedly less than that observed in AD at the group-level, with only a small proportion of patients showing tau uptake in the range observed in AD patients18; some pathological studies have similarly observed a low proportion of PDD patients with AD pathology13. Furthermore, a recent study did not find any evidence of elevated tau uptake in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment with only one of nine patients showing any evidence for tau uptake16. These discrepancies across studies and unexpected findings regarding the relationship with beta-amyloid deposition, point to the need for further tau-PET studies using larger patient samples, and the critical need for autopsy studies to investigate the neuropathological underpinnings of elevated tau-PET signal in these PD spectrum disorders.

PARKINSON-PLUS SYNDROMES

Progressive supranuclear palsy syndromes

Progressive supranuclear palsy is a tauopathy associated with a predominance of 4-repeat (4R) tau isoforms21 (Table 1). The most commonly recognized clinical presentation of PSP is Richardson’s syndrome (PSP-RS) in which patients have early and notable gait and postural instability, frequent falls, and abnormal vertical eye movements (supranuclear gaze palsy)22–24. However, a number of other clinical presentations of PSP have been described24, including, PSP with predominant Parkinsonism (PSP-P)23, PSP with progressive gait freezing25, PSP with predominant frontal presentation26, PSP with a predominant speech/language disorder27, and PSP with predominant corticobasal syndrome28. Patients diagnosed clinically with PSP most commonly have an underlying PSP pathology29–33, although other pathologies observed include CBD and MSA. The probability that the underlying pathology will be PSP is higher for patients that present with the typical symptoms of PSP-RS31. Tau-PET imaging is particularly important in PSP as it is a pure tauopathy, concordance between syndrome and pathology is relatively good, and it tends to have a relatively young age at onset which minimizes the probability of other co-morbidities. Hence, patients with PSP are important targets for treatment trials testing tau modifying drugs. Given that PSP can present with a number of variant clinical syndromes, a diagnostic biomarker for PSP that can be identified early in the disease course is needed.

A number of studies have now assessed tau-PET imaging using the [18F]AV-1451 ligand in PSP patients, with the majority investigating patients clinically diagnosed with PSP-RS (Table 2). A very consistent message has emerged across group-level studies, with PSP-RS showing elevated uptake particularly in subcortical structures, including midbrain, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, thalamus, globus pallidus and striatum compared to controls34–38 (Figure 2). Two studies have found increased uptake in frontal regions, including premotor and precentral regions, although it has been observed predominantly in white matter and it was less striking that the uptake in subcortical regions36, 38. A few studies looked at how well tau in subcortical regions could differentiate PSP-RS from controls34, 37. The globus pallidus provided optimal differentiation in a couple of studies, with sensitivity and specificity of 93% in one study34, and 85% and 92% in the other36. The globus pallidus also performed well in one other study, although optimum differentiation was achieved with the thalamus37. These studies therefore suggest that subcortical regions have potential as useful diagnostic biomarkers in PSP. It should be noted, however, that studies have observed a large degree of overlap between PSP-RS patients and controls which makes diagnosis difficult at the individual-level. This is because off-target binding in controls is observed in many of the PSP-related regions (as discussed below). In fact, one study failed to observe any regions of increased [18F]AV-1451 uptake in a small PSP-RS cohort39.

Similar patterns of uptake in globus pallidus and midbrain in PSP-RS have been observed with [18F]THK-5351, with weaker evidence for cortical uptake40. One study using the [11C]PBB3 ligand has assessed a cohort of PSP-P patients41. Similar to the above studies, they identified elevated tau uptake in the putamen, midbrain and globus pallidus compared to controls. However, they did not identify any elevated uptake in dentate nucleus of the cerebellum or thalamus. While one could hypothesize that these differences may relate to the clinical syndrome, as has been observed with [18F]AV-145136, it is also possible that it may be due to the use of a different tau-PET ligand, especially since these regions were also not identified in the [18F]THK-5351 study40. Studies comparing [11C]PBB3, [18F]THK-5351 and [18F]AV-1451, and comparing PSP variants, will be needed to understand the implication of these findings.

There has also been some disagreement across studies in whether tau uptake in subcortical regions correlates with disease severity in PSP, with two studies observing correlations37, 38 and others not finding any correlations34–36. One positive study found correlations between the PSP rating scale42 and midbrain, thalamus, dentate nucleus, supplementary motor area and motor cortex38, and the other between PSP rating scale and the globus pallidus37. A relationship between tau-PET uptake and disease severity was also observed in PSP-P41. There is also some disagreement regarding whether uptake is related to age in PSP, with one study finding a positive correlation between age and uptake in the striatum37, and one finding no correlations with age34. Differences across studies may be due to clinical differences in the cohorts or the small samples assessed (most published studies have ~10 patients). Larger studies will be needed to better determine clinical and demographic relationships with tau uptake.

Thus far, it is clear that PSP is associated with patterns of tau uptake on PET imaging that are relatively consistent across studies. However, there are a number of issues regarding the uptake properties of [18F]AV-1451 that make interpretation of the findings in PSP patients difficult. First, autoradiographic studies have found no6, 7, 35, 37, 43, or minimal5, 8, 44, binding of [18F]AV-1451 to 4R tau. In addition, a study that assessed [18F]AV-1451 uptake in an autopsy-confirmed patient with PSP found no correlation between tau-PET uptake during life and tau burden in the brain at autopsy45. These results suggest that the affinity of the ligand to 4R tau may be lower than to AD tau, possibly related to differences in tau isoforms or structural differences in tau filaments (Table 1). Autoradiographic studies using the PBB3 and THK-5351 ligands have been more positive, with specific binding to 4R tau inclusions in PSP observed40, showing better performance than [18F]AV-14518. A second issue, is that studies using [18F]AV-1451 have shown off-target binding in healthy controls in many of the regions that are implicated in PSP, including the midbrain and basal ganglia5, with uptake in these regions appearing to increase with age34, 37. It has been hypothesized that [18F]AV-1451 may be binding to iron in the basal ganglia5, 46 or neuromelanin in the midbrain6. Binding in basal ganglia has also been observed in healthy control patients with [18F]THK-535147 and in patients with non-tau diseases using [11C]PBB341, although autoradiographic studies have shown that off-target binding in these regions is minimal with [11C]PBB38. Another issue that should be considered regarding [18F]THK-5351 is that recent studies have suggested that it binds to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), and hence that interpretation of PET findings using this ligand will be confounded by the high MAO-B availability across the brain48. MAO-B levels are affected by smoking49, and hence smoking status could also be a confound. There is some evidence that MAO-B may not be a confound in [18F]AV-1451 studies50, although more work needs to be done to evaluate this issue.

These studies, therefore, question whether the elevated tau uptake observed in the in vivo studies of PSP using [18F]AV-1451 reflect true tau deposition. However, this is still unclear and it may be too early to discount [18F]AV-1451 completely. First, the utility of autoradiographic studies has been questioned, with other PET ligands showing greater sensitivity in in vivo compared to in vitro studies51. Second, the patterns of tau uptake match well with the post-mortem distribution of pathology in PSP36 and match well with findings using the other tau ligands that show better performance in autoradiographic studies. Third, two autopsy studies have found good regional correlations between [18F]AV-1451 uptake during life and tau burden in CBD, another 4R tauopathy44, 52. One study has demonstrated that there is no neuromelanin in the basal ganglia of PSP patients35, suggesting at least that neuromelanin does not explain uptake in this region. It is possible that [18F]AV-1451 may be binding a very small fraction of the total 4R-tau, resulting in the low signal on PET and the lack of findings on autoradiographic studies. Tau burden in PSP is typically much lower than that observed in AD which shows striking findings on autoradiography. Further studies are clearly necessary in order to understand the origins of the elevated tau-PET signal in PSP. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the underlying mechanism, tau-PET imaging could still provide useful biomarkers in PSP if it performs well in differential diagnosis and if longitudinal measures correlate well with disease progression, akin to say a midbrain volumetric measurement. More work is needed to determine how well tau-PET performs compared to other more established biomarkers in PSP53.

Corticobasal syndrome

The term corticobasal syndrome describes a clinical syndrome that is characterized by progressive asymmetric cortical and extrapyramidal dysfunction, including ideomotor limb apraxia, cortical sensory loss, alien-limb phenomenon, and myoclonus54. The corticobasal syndrome is, however, pathologically heterogeneous and can be the presenting syndrome of a host of different pathologies including CBD, PSP, AD and FTLD-TDP55–5859. Pathological studies have shown that the most common pathology underlying corticobasal syndrome is CBD, followed by AD, then PSP and then FTLD-TDP33, 55, 60, 61. Studies typically utilize beta-amyloid PET imaging in order to identify corticobasal syndrome patients that likely have AD pathology; although little data it available on how well beta-amyloid PET results relate to autopsy findings of AD pathology in corticobasal syndrome. Therefore, tau-PET imaging has the potential to help investigate tau deposition related to CBD, but also to determine the relationship between beta-amyloid and tau deposition in corticobasal syndrome.

Group studies have found a relatively consistent pattern of tau uptake on PET imaging in corticobasal syndrome patients that do not show beta-amyloid deposition, and hence likely do not have AD pathology. These patients show tau uptake, albeit relatively mild, on [18F]AV-1451 and [18F]THK-5351 in precentral and postcentral cortex, superior frontal and parietal lobe, putamen and globus pallidus62–64 (Table 2). Uptake was observed in the grey matter of these regions, but also in the white matter underlying these regions, and patterns are typically asymmetric, showing the greatest involvement in the hemisphere contralateral to the affected limb62, 64. A similar pattern of uptake in neocortex and basal ganglia has been observed in a single patient scanned with [11C]PBB34. One study found evidence that [18F]AV-1451 uptake in pre and postcentral cortex correlated to motor severity, as measured by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale62, suggesting a relationship between tau uptake and disease progression. The weakness of many of these studies, however, is that the underlying pathology of these patients is unclear, other than ruling out AD due to negative beta-amyloid PET scans62–64. In fact, one study found tau-PET uptake in structures that typically show elevated tau levels in PSP, including thalamus, midbrain and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, suggesting the possibility of underlying PSP pathology in at least some of the patients62.

Tau-PET findings using the [18F]AV-1451 ligand have been reported in two patients that had autopsy confirmed CBD44, 52. One of these patients presented with a primary progressive apraxia of speech65, later developed agrammatic aphasia and clinical features of corticobasal syndrome, and showed elevated tau uptake in putamen, pallidum, thalamus, precentral cortex, rolandic operculum, supplementary motor area, and left Broca’s area44. The other patient presented with PSP-RS, later developed features of corticobasal syndrome, and showed elevated uptake in bilateral substantia nigra, globus pallidus, bilateral frontal and posterior temporal cortical regions along with midbrain and pons52. Patterns of uptake in these two patients overlapped to some degree with the patterns reported in corticobasal syndrome, with some regional differences that appear to be related to clinical differences between the patients. For example, involvement of the supplementary motor area and Broca’s area may be related to the speech and language difficulties in the first patient, as is the case with structural MRI66, and involvement of brainstem may be related to the PSP-RS in the second patient. Importantly, both of these studies also showed that the degree of regional tau-PET uptake across the brain correlated well with the regional distribution of tau pathology at autopsy in these two patients44, 52, suggesting that the tau-PET signal is reflecting underlying tau pathology in CBD. The fact that these correlations were observed despite autoradiographic studies finding little or no binding of [18F]AV-1451 to tau in CBD, may suggest that the ligand is binding a small fraction of the total 4R-tau burden, as is the case in PSP44.

Tau-PET uptake has been reported in four corticobasal syndrome patients that showed beta-amyloid deposition on PET scanning, across three studies2, 63, 64. Three of these four patients also showed elevated tau uptake in the range one would expect in AD increasing confidence in the presence of underlying AD pathology in these patients2, 64. Two of the three patients showed temporoparietal tau uptake in a pattern similar to AD64, and the other showed tau uptake in primary and association sensorimotor cortex more akin to the patterns reported in corticobasal syndrome2. However, one corticobasal syndrome patient with evidence for beta-amyloid deposition did not show a visually different pattern or degree of tau-PET uptake compared to four patients without beta-amyloid deposition in one study63. The reason for the discrepancy in topographic pattern of tau uptake across these presumed corticobasal syndrome-AD patients is unclear, and larger studies will be needed to help determine the relationship between AD pathology and patterns of tau-PET uptake in corticobasal syndrome.

A number of studies have looked to see how well regional patterns of tau-PET uptake correlate with regional patterns of grey matter atrophy or cortical thickness reduction in corticobasal syndrome. Generally, strong correlations have been observed between tau-PET and atrophy in patients that show beta-amyloid deposition2, 64. However, findings have been more variable in corticobasal syndrome patients that do not show beta-amyloid deposition, typically with only weak correlations observed44, 52, 64. We could hypothesize that this difference is likely related to the degree of tau-PET uptake; since cases with AD tend to show greater tau-PET uptake and atrophy, and hence better correlations between metrics. In fact, one study made the observation that patterns of atrophy in beta-amyloid negative corticobasal syndrome were much more striking than the patterns of tau-PET uptake64.

Multiple system atrophy

Multiple system atrophy is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized pathologically by alpha-synuclein deposits predominantly in oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions67. Patients present with a combination of cerebellar ataxia, autonomic symptoms, and features of parkinsonism, such as tremor, rigidity and problems with muscle coordination and gait68. Patients with the parkinsonian type (MSA-P) present with parkinsonism as the most prominent symptoms. Tau-PET imaging using the [18F]AV-1451 ligand has been reported in four patients with MSA-P, with all four showing elevated uptake in the putamen compared to controls69 (Table 2). However, given that autoradiographic studies have convincing demonstrated a lack of binding of [18F]AV-1451 to alpha-synuclein in multiple system atrophy5, 6, the authors conclude that uptake likely reflects off-target binding in this region. Tau-PET imaging has also been reported using the [11C]PBB3 ligand in one MSA-P patient41. This patient showed widespread increased uptake in the cortex and subcortical structures41. While intriguing given that MSA is not a tauopathy, the findings are consistent with an autoradiographic study that observed binding of [11C]PBB3 to glial cytoplasmic inclusions in MSA cases with severe pathology70. However, further work is clearly needed to understand the pathologic underpinnings of the tau-PET signal in MSA.

FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA WITH PARKINSONISM

Parkinsonism can occur in patients with frontotemporal dementia, particularly in patients with genetic mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene that is located on chromosome 1771. These patients usually present with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, characterized by changes in behavioral and personality, and parkinsonism at an early age of onset. Multiple pathogenic mutations in MAPT have been identified which have different neuropathological underpinnings72, with some mutations having a pure 4R tauopathy in the brain, some with a pure 3R tauopathy and others have a mixed 3R/4R tauopathy with tau aggregates showing similar confirmation and biochemical composition to neurofibrillary tangles in AD73–76 (Table 1). Autoradiographic results in frontotemporal dementia with MAPT mutations have been variable, likely related to variability across specific MAPT mutations (Table 1). Two autoradiographic studies have both found striking binding of [18F]AV-1451 to tau in cases with the R406W mutation that has both 3R and 4R tau isoforms5, 7. However, binding was absent to minimal in cases with the N279K and P301L mutations which are both associated with 4R tau5, 43. Of two cases with an exon 10+16 mutation, one showed binding to tau in the frontal and temporal lobes, and the other showed no binding7. The [11C]PBB3 ligand has also been shown to bind to tau in frontotemporal dementia cases with MAPT mutations characterized by 4R tau, and in those characterized by 3R tau deposition8. Patients with MAPT mutations typically show frontotemporal atrophy on MRI, with a particular focus on the temporal lobes77. The MAPT mutations provide a great target for tau-PET imaging, particularly as they are pure tauopathies and the familial nature allows assessments in presymptomatic disease stages.

Tau-PET imaging findings with the [18F]AV-1451 ligand have been reported in a handful of patients with MAPT mutations (Table 2). Two studies assessed patients with mutations that are characterized by deposition of both 3R and 4R tau, with one study reporting findings in one patient with the V337M mutation78 and the other reporting findings in three patients with the R406W mutation79. Elevated tau uptake in the temporal and frontal lobes and basal ganglia was associated with both of these MAPT mutations, matching patterns of atrophy and the pattern of tau deposition at autopsy in other V337M cases78. A positive correlation between regional tau-PET uptake and tau burden at autopsy in one of the R406W patients that died within two weeks of the PET scan also demonstrated that the [18F]AV-1451 findings likely reflect underlying tau79. The degree of tau-PET uptake in the R406W patients was also in the range expected in AD, perhaps reflecting the pathological similarities between these diseases.

Tau-PET findings using [18F]AV-1451 have also been reported in patients with mutations that are characterized by deposition of 4R hyperphosphorylated tau, namely the S305N, N279K and intron 10+16 mutations. Low levels of uptake were observed in two S305N patients and one N279K patient, with uptake mostly observed in the white matter5. However, elevated tau-PET uptake was observed in a patient with the intron 10+16 MAPT mutation80. Tau-PET uptake was observed in the inferior temporal lobe and temporal pole, although the degree of uptake was relatively mild compared to controls and appeared to focus in the white matter. The pathological explanation for the uptake in the white matter is currently unclear. Therefore, it appears as though tau-PET imaging may be a useful biomarker in MAPT mutations, although possibly only in those associated with 3R/4R tauopathies.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Little data is currently available to assess the value of tau-PET imaging to differentiate different parkinsonism syndromes. A couple of studies have compared PSP, a 4R tauopathy, with PD, a non-tauopathy, and shown that patients with PSP show greater [18F]AV-1451 uptake in the substantia nigra, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and dentate nucleus compared to patients with PD34, 36. The globus pallidus provided optimum separation of these diseases in both studies with sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% in one study34, and sensitivity of 84.8% and specificity of 92.3% in another multi-center study36. There is, therefore, some evidence that tau-PET could be useful to differentiate tauopathies from non-tauopathies, although the biological basis for the signal in PSP is unclear and it is uncertain whether tau-PET could be diagnostically useful when visually assessed in individual patients. Differences in tau uptake have also been observed between PSP-RS and corticobasal syndrome in one study, with corticobasal syndrome showing greater uptake on [18F]AV-1451 in the subcortical white matter underlying motor cortex64. However, while these early investigations seem promising much more work is needed to validate and investigate differences among parkinsonian disorders in larger studies, and it will be important to determine how well tau-PET performs compared to other imaging metrics.

It is clear that the patterns of tau-PET uptake in the pure 4R tauopathies of PSP and corticobasal syndrome differ from patterns reported in AD, with AD showing dramatically more uptake throughout the temporoparietal cortex than either PSP-RS35, 38 or corticobasal syndrome63, 64. Conversely, there is also evidence for differences in the opposite direction. Hence, PSP-RS patients have been shown to have greater uptake in the midbrain35, 38, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum38 and thalamus38 than AD, and corticobasal patients have been shown to have greater uptake in the motor cortex and basal ganglia than AD63, 64. These findings reflect the fact that subcortical structures and motor cortex are typically spared in AD. While the differential diagnosis of AD from these atypical parkinsonian disorders is not typically critical, these findings do demonstrate some disease specificity of tau-PET.

SUMMARY

A number of studies have been published over the last year assessing tau-PET imaging in patients with parkinsonian disorders, with the vast majority assessing the [18F]AV-1451 ligand. Some issues that should be considered (Table 2), however, is that many, if not all, of these early studies had relatively small patient cohorts. There were also some methodological differences between them, with most studies analyzing the tau-PET signal as a standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), although some analyzed quantitative dynamic imaging and binding potentials. The use of a cerebellar reference region was consistent across studies. A correction for the presence of atrophy using partial volume averaging was performed in some studies but not all; although most studies found relatively consistent findings both with and without partial volume correction. How these methodological differences influenced variability across studies is currently unclear and more work is needed to compare analysis techniques, compare diseases, as well as to compare across tau-PET ligands.

The general message that emerged from these studies is that tau-PET imaging using [18F]AV-1451 shows a striking signal in patients suspected of having underlying AD type tau, and milder signal in patients with 4R tauopathies such as PSP, corticobasal syndrome, and frontotemporal dementia with MAPT mutations. However, mildly elevated tau-PET signal was also observed in some alpha-synucleinopathies, including DLB and MSA-P. Many of these findings do not concur with autoradiographic studies and there are also limitations due to potential off-target binding, and hence it will be important for future work to help understand the nature of binding in these diseases. Given these limitations, there is a clear need for better and more specific tau PET ligands to study this group of disorders. New tau-PET ligands that may show higher affinity to 4R tau, and show fewer issues with off-target binding are currently being developed and may prove valuable in these parkinsonian disorders.

Figure 1 [18F]AV-1451 findings in dementia with Lewy bodies

Group-level patterns of tau-PET uptake in 19 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies compared to controls are shown in panel A. Elevated uptake is observed in the occipital lobe. These renders were kindly provided by Dr. Kantarci, Mayo Clinic, and modified from Kantarci et al. 201718. Panel B shows mild elevated cortical tau-PET uptake in a patient with Dementia with Lewy bodies that showed no beta-amyloid uptake on Pittsburgh Compound B PET imaging.

Figure 2 [18F]AV-1451 tau PET images in a healthy control and PSP-RS patient

Standard uptake value ratio images are shown for a 59 year old healthy control and a 64 year old PSP-RS patient. The PSP-RS patient shows elevated uptake in the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus and basal ganglia, with very mild uptake observed in white matter underlying the cortex.

Figure 3 [18F]AV-1451 tau PET images in corticobasal syndrome

The top panel shows standard uptake value ratio images for a 67 year old corticobasal syndrome patient that showed no beta-amyloid uptake on Pittsburgh Compound B PET imaging. This patient showed elevated uptake in premotor and motor cortices and the basal ganglia. The bottom panel shows standard uptake value ratio images for a 53 year old corticobasal syndrome patient that showed elevated beta-amyloid uptake on Pittsburgh Compound B PET imaging. This patient showed widespread and severe tau-PET uptake throughout the cortex, consistent with underlying Alzheimer’s disease pathology.

Box 1 Main messages of the review

Studies using tau-PET imaging ligands [18F]AV-1451, [18F]THK-5351 and [11C]PBB3 have been performed across a wide range of parkinsonian disorders over the last year.

Elevated tau uptake in temporal, parietal and occipital lobes has been observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease that have cognitive impairment and dementia with Lewy bodies, likely related to concomitant Alzheimer’s disease.

Progressive supranuclear palsy is associated with mild elevated tau uptake in subcortical structures, including midbrain, dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, thalamus and globus pallidus.

Patients with corticobasal syndrome with biomarker evidence for Alzheimer’s disease tend to show striking tau uptake in the range typically observed in Alzheimer’s disease; with milder tau uptake observed in motor cortex in corticobasal syndrome without biomarker evidence for Alzheimer’s disease.

Patients with frontotemporal dementia and mutations in the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) gene show variable results in tau-PET studies, with mutations associated with 3 and 4-repeat tau deposition tending to show high frontotemporal tau uptake, and mutations associated with 4-repeat tau showing less striking uptake often located in the white matter.

Elevated tau uptake has also been observed in multiple system atrophy, a synucleinopathy.

The results of these clinical tau-PET studies do not always agree with in vitro autoradiographic studies and more work is therefore needed to understand the biological substrate of elevated tau uptake in in vivo studies, particularly in the 4-repeat tauopathies and synucleinopathies

Given the limitations of the currently available ligands, there is a clear need for better and more specific tau PET ligands to study this group of disorders.
