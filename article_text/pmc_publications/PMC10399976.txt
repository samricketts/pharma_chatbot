Abnormal gait is a significant non-cognitive biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Micro-Doppler radar, a non-wearable technology, can capture human gait movements for potential early ADRD risk assessment. In this research, we propose to design STRIDE integrating micro-Doppler radar sensors with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. STRIDE embeds a new deep learning (DL) classification framework. As a proof of concept, we develop a “digital-twin” of STRIDE, consisting of a human walking simulation model and a micro-Doppler radar simulation model, to generate a gait signature dataset. Taking established human walking parameters, the walking model simulates individuals with ADRD under various conditions. The radar model based on electromagnetic scattering and the Doppler frequency shift model is employed to generate micro-Doppler signatures from different moving body parts (e.g., foot, limb, joint, torso, shoulder, etc.). A band-dependent DL framework is developed to predict ADRD risks. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of STRIDE for evaluating ADRD risk.

pmcI. Introduction

An estimated 6.5 million elderly people in the US currently have Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and the number is expected to increase to 13.8 million in 2050 [1]. Neurological changes of AD and AD-related dementia (ADRD) may occur 10–20 years before clinical symptoms arise [2]. Thus, there is a growing consensus that treatment should target the disease in the early phases, ideally before clinical symptoms manifest. This relies on screening and early detection services to recognize significant biomarkers.

Abnormal gait is prevalent in established dementia [3], human gaits shall be an effective bio-marker associated with progression from normal cognition, cognitive complaints, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia syndromes [4]–[9]. In addition, gait variability can be observed 10 years before clinical symptoms of ADRD [10]. Referenced as the “sixth vital sign” [11], gait parameters (e.g., speed, step/stride length, and step time/angle) have been quantitively investigated for their association with cognitive performance [12]. Gait parameters also have been employed as a marker to support diagnosis among healthy elderly, MCI, and AD patients [13]. Given their importance, gait-related sensors are becoming increasingly necessary to capture motions and assist ADRD early diagnosis.

Radar, a non-wearable sensor (NWS), has been demonstrated to be effective in capturing object movements remotely [14]–[17] and is also capable of detecting micro-motion (e.g. vitasigns) [18]. Unlike wearable sensors, NWS is not intrusive and does not require continuous wear by the elderly. Other NWS systems, based on optoelectronic sensors or camera-based visual image sequences [3], are subject to various issues. For example, it can be easily affected by the distance of the human subject from the sensor, variations in lighting, background complexity, deformations caused by human clothing, or some coverings on the human subject. Additionally, privacy concerns are often raised when camera-based sensors record plain images of the subject or environment. In several studies, micro-Doppler radar (MDR) is effective for capturing gait motion by utilizing the Doppler effect to only reflect movements [18]–[23].

Gait motions during walking are monitored by MDR and transformed into micro-Doppler signatures. These signatures are then represented on a time-frequency image such as a spectrogram. Gait features, then, are estimated for MCI recognition [24]–[26] and dementia diagnosis [27]. Typically, leg motions derived from upper and lower envelopes on a spectrogram are proven to be distinctive features [24]–[26]. Artificial Intelligence (AI), mostly Machine learning (ML), plays a critical role in bridging the gap between estimated gait parameters and cognitive impairment.

Admittedly, ML-based applications are effective in correlating gait parameters with dementia, and their prediction performances are promising. However, the potential of Deep Learning (DL), a prevalent research branch of AI, has yet to be fully explored for the evaluation of ADRD risk. Unlike ML, DL models the relationship between inputs and outputs and learns to identify effective features through end-to-end training [28]. Additionally, DL has shown outperformance over ML in radar sensing applications [23], [29]–[31].

In this study, we propose a systematic radar intelligence analysis for ADRD risk evaluation (STRIDE) with gait signature simulation and DL. The STRIDE integrates MDR sensors to capture human gait signatures and assess the level of gait impairment associated with ADRD risk levels, with the assistance of DL models. A large gait signature dataset is essential for implementing DL models. However, there is no publicly available gait data set related to ARRD risk evaluation, to the best of our knowledge. To conduct a pilot test of the concept, we develop the “digital-twin” of STRIDE including a human walking simulator, a MDR simulator to address the absence of gait data about dementia. This research has three contributions:

STRIDE, an integrated system for ADRD risk assessment with potential clinical utility is proposed;

To validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the system for ADRD studies, a “digital-twin” is designed and implemented for gait signature generation;

A novel DL framework, named band-dependent learning (BDL), is developed to automatically assess the ADRD risk. Observing band-dependent patterns in radar spectrogram, BDL-ResNet is designed to capture the information effectively by identifying the salient sub-bands along frequency and time ranges.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the details of “digital-twin” and BDL of STRIDE are provided followed by the experiments in Section III. The conclusion and future work are discussed in Section IV.

II. Automatic ADRD Risk Evaluation System – Radar Scenario, Gait Simulation, and Learning Model

An overview of STRIDE is illustrated in Fig. 1. STRIDE consists of (1) a human walking simulation model using the parameters collected from the literature; (2) a MDR simulation model to monitor animated human walking; and (3) a DL framework for ADRD risk assessment.

A. Human Walking Simulation Model

Human gait, which reflects the manner of human walking, has been studied for decades in biomedical engineering, sports medicine, physiotherapy, medical diagnosis, and rehabilitation [3], [32]–[34]. Human walk is a highly coordinated periodic movement involving the brain, muscles, nerves, joints, and bones [35], [36]. It has been observed that the gait features of individuals with memory and cognitive dysfunctions are different from those of normal people [33], [37]. And, the severity of dementia may correlate with the presence of gait abnormalities [38].

Clinical literature indicates that elderly individuals with dementia may exhibit lower walking speed, shorter step length, imbalanced steps, and longer stance phases compared to healthy elderly people [38]. In addition, individuals with severe abnormalities may walk with head and neck bent over, with drag, drop, or shuffle feet, or with irregular or jerky walking. Thus, analyzing gait features shall help capture and even predict possible cognitive decline. Despite the extensive literature on the use of gait features in supporting the diagnosis of memory and cognitive dysfunctions [4], [10], [39]–[44], existing gait datasets are limited to young, healthy individuals and collected in a clinical/laboratory setting. A large, publicly available dataset for gait abnormality analysis is currently lacking.

To address the challenge, we propose to develop a human walking simulation model for various ADRD risk levels. Human gait can be decomposed into periodic motions in a gait cycle. One cycle consists of two phases: the stance (or support) phase and the swing phase [35]. During the stance phase, the foot is on the ground with a heel strike and a toe-off. In the swing phase, the foot is lifted from the ground with acceleration or deceleration. Key parameters used to describe a complete walking gait include walking speed, step length, and stance time, with associated variances. The walking cycle is also divided into three durations: the duration of single support, the duration of balance, and the duration of double support characterized based on the contact of the feet with the ground [35].

We develop a simulated walking model based on the well-validated global walking model [45], [46]. Using the parameters collected from literature depicting elderly gait patterns (see Table 1), the human walking simulation model generates a large number of experimental human gait data with various spatial and temporal characteristics in the 3D space. The MATLAB source code is provided in [45].

The global walking model presents the gait motion by 3D trajectories of a walking human body over time. Specifically, one cycle of gait motion is described by 3 translations, and 14 rotations (4 body rotations and 10 body parts rotations). The translations and rotations depend on walking speed, which can be derived from biomechanical experimental data [45], [47]. Based on the translations and the rotations, twelve 3D translational trajectories are obtained. The positions of the 17 joint points at each time frame are derived from the 3D trajectories using the Euler angle rotation matrix [45]. The joint motions in the 3D space are used to deduce the movements of human body parts, such as head, torso, shoulders, arms, hips, legs, and feet. It is worth noting that the linear and angular kinematic parameters are further used to calculate radar returns caused by the walking motions (see Section II-B).

Table 1 summarizes the parameters used in the model under four different ADRD conditions. As aforementioned, a walking cycle consists of the duration of support, balance, and double support. These durations are related to the duration of walking cycle which is influenced by the height and the walking speed. They are used to derive the motion of the joints. In this study, we assume an elderly with height, from H=1.60m to 1.80m, and walking speed, V=0.6m/s [38]. According to [45], [47], we get the following parameters:

The relative speed is rescaled by the height of the leg, RV=V/(H/2)≈0.68 to 0.76;

For a normal walking cycle, the duration of a walking cycle is determined by Dc=1.346/Rv≈1.54s to 1.63s;

The duration of support is Ds=0.762*Dc−0.143≈1.02s to 1.09s;

The duration of balance is Db=0.248*Dc+0.143≈0.52s to 0.55s;

The duration of double support is Dds=0.252*Dc−0.143≈0.25s to 0.27s. Note, Dc=Ds+Db.

Compared to normal walking, the elderly abnormal walking has a longer duration of stance, i.e., 60%−75% of the duration of the walking cycle, leading to longer support duration. According to [38], we summarize the percentage of support duration Psd for each category in Table 1. Ds,Db, and Dds are given as following: (1) Ds=Psd(1+0.15*rand)*Dc,

(2) Db=Dc−Ds,

(3) Dds=0.25*Ds,

where rand is a random number within [0, 1].

B. Doppler Radar Simulation Model

MDR is effective in detecting micro-motions - humans periodically swing their arms and legs and move the body’s center of gravity up and down [35], [45]. The global walking speed can also be inferred from the motions captured by MDR [19]. MDR devices have been utilized to observe the walking process and produce corresponding micro-Doppler signatures for gait analysis [19], [21].

In our case, a Doppler radar simulation model is developed to detect walking motions on the virtual path [45]. The radar is located at the end of the path (e.g., X1=10m,Y1=0m, and Z1=1m) and the starting point of human walking is located at (X0=0,Y0=0, and Z0=0). Once the walking (Section II-A) starts, a frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar is simulated to periodically transmit and receive signals until the walking simulation ends.

According to [45], the Doppler frequency shift fD,k, induced by motions of human bodies during the walking process, is calculated as: (4) fD,k=−2fc/cvkcosθk,

where c is the wave propagation speed, fc is the radar carrier frequency, vk is the velocity of the k th body part, and θk is the corresponding line-of-sight angle between the radar and the k th body part. For the FMCW radar, the Doppler resolution and the range resolution are computed, respectively, by: (5) ΔfD=1/nTsw,

(6) ΔR=c/(2ΔB),

where n is the number of group sweeps,Tsw is the sweep time and ΔB is the bandwidth of the signal [45].

In this study, the bandwidth of the radar is 1.5GHz, the sweep time is 1.0ms, and the number of group sweeps is 512. Therefore, the simulated MDR has 0.1m. range resolution and 1.95GHz. Doppler resolution. The received signals are transformed into micro-Doppler signatures on a spectrogram through the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) [48].

C. Band-dependent Deep Learning Model for ADRD Risk Assessment

The spectrogram, which contains micro-Doppler signatures of walking (see Fig. 1), is a 1-channel time-frequency image. Recently, Deep learning (DL) has made great success in image studies including time-frequency images [23], [28], [49], [50]. Unlike the natural image, the spectrogram represents a signal in a view of both time and frequency. It shows the variation in the frequency domain and does not satisfy the translation invariance [51]. In addition, as frequency increases, the power of the reflected signal decreases. Therefore, considering a certain frequency range as a sub-band, time-frequency spectrogram often has band-dependent patterns observed.

Several studies have adopted convolutional networks on sub-bands by limiting the kernel sharing or customizing the kernel scale [50]–[53]. The issue with such an approach is it requires extensive computation and memory to run multiple network models in parallel. To dedicate one network model for each sub-band, [54] proposes a shared network and develops a band-level normalization to adjust the imbalanced scales between the sub-bands. However, in our study, such normalization may face serious challenges from the high-frequency band where the power of the noise is similar to that of the signal reflecting from the body parts such as feet and legs (see Fig. 3).

To address this issue, we propose a band-dependent learning (BDL) framework to divide the spectrogram and fuse the diverse representations of sub-bands. The framework leverages the generalization capabilities of vision models such as ResNet-18 [55] and separately identifies representations in each sub-band. The obtained representations (feature vectors) are then normalized to reduce the scale difference between sub-bands and selectively combined to balance the contribution of each sub-band using a learnable weight vector.

The workflow of the band-dependent learning framework is illustrated in Fig. 2. The input spectrogram is first equally partitioned into N non-overlapping sub-bands with the output feature vectors depicting the characteristics of the sub-bands. This way ensures that the features of each band are captured fairly. The feature vectors are then normalized to be on the unit hypersphere so that the scale difference between sub-bands can be mitigated. Next, the feature vectors are concatenated and multiplied by a learnable weight vector whose dimension corresponds to the number of the sub-bands. This vector is used to fuse the N feature vectors to adjust the contributions from the sub-bands on the final feature vector. Before the multiplication, the elements of the weight vector are mapped to [0, 1] by the sigmoid function. Hence, the elements of the weight vector are initialized to 0. The weighted feature vector is used in a classifier for the final prediction.

III. Experiments

The human walking simulator generates four types of walks for ADRD risks: Normal, Subtle Abnormality, Moderate Abnormality, and Severe Abnormality. The parameters are randomly selected within the ranges specified in Table 1. In this study, 2000 walks for each category are generated, resulting in a total of 8000 samples. These walking animations are presented on a simulated 10m walking path under the detection of the Doppler radar. −15dBm adaptive weight gaussian noise (AWGN) is added to the channel to mimic the real-world scenario. The radar records approximately a 4-second walking period and transforms all collected signals into MDR signatures on a spectrogram by STFT. For STFT, the number of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) points is 512 and there are 256 overlapped samples for each window. The Kaiser window with 256 points is employed. Each spectrogram thus has a 1-channel time-frequency image with 512 and 776 dimensions for the frequency and time domains, respectively.

Spectrograms are preprocessed by applying x=20*log10(x+1e−5) to each data point x. This function can magnify the low-power data points which might be the signatures of the foot and the leg. Fig. 3 displays example micro-Doppler signatures of the four ADRD risk levels under the noisy scenario. Most of the signatures appear in the positive frequency and a few in the negative frequency because human arms and hips periodically move forward and backward while walking. In addition, most of the signatures of the joint occur within −100,300Hz. The signatures of feet and legs which have faster moving speeds appear in the whole positive frequency. However, the signals are shadowed by the noises and become blurred in the high-frequency range.

To verify the performance of the ADRD risk assessment model (BDL-ResNet), the 8000 samples are divided into a training set (70%), a validation set (15%), and a test set (15%). For comparison, two DL models (GoogleNet [56] and ResNet-18 [55]) and two ML models [24], [27] are implemented as benchmarks. The DL models are fine-tuned on the training set and they tend to focus on the entire frequency domain for representation learning. Please note that the 1-channel spectrogram is replicated three times to fit the input requirement (3-channel) of the DL vision models. The two ML models extract gait-related features and use support vector machine (SVM) [24] and neural network (NN) [27] as the classifier, respectively.

For the parameter settings, the output from ResNet-18 is a 512-dimensional feature vector. The classifier of BDL-ResNet is a 512 by 4 one-layer fully connected network using the relu activation and the batch normalization. All experiments use the cross-entropy as the loss function and 64 as the batch size. For the weight vector, 2e−1 is employed for faster convergence. We set the learning rate to 1e−3 for all DL models and train them up to 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer [57]. The training process is early stopped based on the validation results. For the ML models, all settings are as specified in the original references.

To fully compare the performance of the algorithms, we use accuracy for overall evaluation. Precision and sensitivity are for class-wise evaluation. The metrics are defined as follows: (7) Accuracy=#ofcorrectpredictions/total#ofsamples,

(8) Precision=TP/(TP+FP),

(9) Sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN),

where TP,FP, and FN are true positive samples, false positive samples, and false negative samples. These three variables are evaluated in a class-specific manner [58].

First, to determine the number of sub-bands, N, we conduct experiments training the models using N from 2, 4, 8 to 16 and test them on the validation set for comparison. The accuracy results are summarized in Table 2. The validation results indicate that the model performs well for N being 8 and 16. We decide to set N to 8 considering the computation efficiency. The result that the accuracy increases with N also demonstrates the advantages of sub-band-based studies.

Next, BDL-ResNet (N=8) is compared with the other four algorithms in overall and class-wise evaluations on the test set. To evaluate the robustness of the method, the experiments are repeated 30 times. Please note that the data set is re-split and the models are reinitialized in each run. The means and standard deviations of the four metrics are calculated. We conduct the one-sided t-test using the results of the 30 runs. It can be concluded that BDL-ResNet is statistically greater than the competitor when p-value is less than 0.05.

As summarized in Table 3, BDL-ResNet significantly outperforms the other algorithms in terms of overall accuracy with at least 95% confidence. Both DL vision models provide competitive performance for ADRD risk evaluation, while ML_NN only achieves 74% overall accuracy. The BDL framework significantly improves the performance of ResNet according to the result (0.923±0.018vs.0.884±0.078, p=0.012). This improvement indicates the advantage of band-dependent learning, which reduces the impact of variability among frequencies and emphasizes the salient sub-bands.

The class-wise performance results are presented in Table 4. For the normal and subtle abnormality groups, our method performs the best with at least 95% confidence in terms of precision and is comparable to the best candidates for sensitivity. Specifically, for the normal group, BDL-ResNet outperforms ResNet-18 in precision (0.977±0.028vs.0.877±0.294, p=0.037) and sensitivity (0.996±0.009vs.0.861±0.307, p=0.011). For the subtle abnormal walking group, BDL-ResNet outperforms ResNet-18 in terms of precision (0.822±0.035vs.0.77±0.134, p=0.023) and obtains a comparable sensitivity result. This group is the most challenging to investigate and has the worst overall prediction performance among all four groups, but our method still outperforms ResNet-18 in categorizing subjects with subtle abnormalities, due to the benefits of the BDL framework. In addition, BDL-ResNet is statistically better than two ML models (0.750±0.002 and 0.577±0.027) in terms of precision to a large extent to detect the subtle abnormality. These results are desirable showing our method can better categorize normal walking with fewer “false alarms” and more accurately detect subtle abnormality (early stage).

For the severe abnormality groups, all algorithms have excellent performance. This indicates the power of deep learning in general to support the study. For the moderate abnormality group, it is interesting to observe our method exhibits comparable performance to other candidates. However, our method marginally underperforms in precision (0.920±0.072vs.0.942±0.013, p=0.945) and sensitivity (0.794±0.071vs.0.805±0.072, p=0.705) though no statistical conclusion can be drawn. It is our intention to improve our framework focusing on this group as the immediate next step.

To further shed light on the behavior of the model, we visualize the weights that the model places on each sub-band. Please note that the model uniformly splits the spectrogram into 8 sub-bands. Fig. 4 illustrates the weight values and the corresponding body parts whose signatures appear in each sub-band. The trained model gives high importance, 0.96 and 0.86, to the third sub-band and the fourth sub-band, respectively. The results indicate that the model underscores these two sub-bands which contain the signatures of all body parts. The third band contains the clear signatures of the legs’ movements, whereas, the fourth band contains the overlapping signatures of all body parts. The legs’ signatures strongly correlate to the walking dysfunction caused by ADRD [8]. The signatures in the fifth band have a lower importance rate (0.41), despite being related to movements of the feet and the legs. These signatures correspond to the duration of double support when both feet are in contact with the ground and the legs are together. Hence, the differences between categories are less discriminative in this sub-band. Although the first two sub-bands have the signatures of the feet and the legs, the power of the signatures is relatively low. Their shapes become blurred as they are shadowed by the noise. In addition, the last three bands are uninformative ranges (the last three bands), which have no micro-Doppler signature. The model can recognize these facts and pays nearly zero attention to those sub-bands. These results verify our proposed model and motivate our future work to interrogate the clinical implications focusing on the signatures from important sub-bands.

IV. Discussion

Referring to dementia-related gait parameters, the “digital-twin” can produce adequate gait signatures for four different ADRD risk levels to validate the concept of STRIDE. The ADRD risk assessment model is built upon the novel BDL framework, where the scale difference among sub-bands is normalized in a high-level feature space and the significant sub-band is augmented in the decision-making of the classifier. Benefiting from this advantage, BDL-ResNet demonstrates its superiority compared to the four SOTA models according to the results of the overall evaluation (accuracy), as well as the class-wise evaluations (precision and sensitivity). In addition, since the competitive performances on the normal and subtle abnormality groups, we conclude our method has great potential to be an early detection tool for ADRD assessment.

In future work, we plan to address the following limitations. First, it can be challenging to classify subjects of the subtle and moderate abnormality groups. We thus plan to include Focal Loss or sampling methods so the model would concentrate more on these easily miss-classified samples. Additionally, the number of sub-bands used in the framework is currently determined by the validation. We plan to develop a trainable band division model to adaptively divide the original spectrogram into several high inter- and low intra-difference sub-bands. It is also important to note that the simulation scenario of STRIDE is close to an empty experiment room with channel noise, which is not a realistic case. Interference from clutter and multi-subjects should be further included in the simulation to mimic a daily living scenario. Other than these factors, an elderly-specific human model is expected to analyze characteristics of elderly people, such as humpback and tremors. In addition, MDR sensors have been used in-bed monitoring for vital signs in the hospital. It is our intention to explore the applicability of STRIDE in a real living context and clinics for field testing. We plan to explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the trained DL model of STRIDE to real-world data.

V. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed STRIDE, systematic radar intelligence analysis for ADRD risk evaluation, as a potential clinical tool. To validate the concept, we developed a “digital-twin” of STRIDE and a novel DL framework focusing on frequency band-dependent learning ability. We generated a valid gait signature dataset categorized according to ADRD risk level and then conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DL model for ADRD risk assessment. Experimental results supported the effectiveness and feasibility of the system in terms of the quality of the ADRD risk assessment. In addition, we leveraged the learned weight vector for clinical interpretation.
