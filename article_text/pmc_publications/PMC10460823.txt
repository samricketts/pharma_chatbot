Objective.

To directly compare the effect of incident age 68+ traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the risk of diagnosis of clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the general population of older adults, and between male veterans and non-veterans; to assess how this effect changes with time since TBI.

Setting and Participants.

Community dwelling traditional Medicare beneficiaries age 68+ from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).

Design.

Fine-Gray models combined with inverse probability weighting were used to identify associations between incident TBI, post-TBI duration and TBI treatment intensity, with a diagnosis of clinical AD dementia. The study included 16,829 older adults followed over the 1991–2015 period. For analyses of veteran-specific risks 4,281 veteran males and 3,093 non-veteran males were identified. Analysis of veteran females was unfeasible due to the age-structure of the population. Information on occurrence(s) of TBI, and onset of AD and risk-related co-morbidities was constructed from individual-level HRS-linked Medicare claim records while demographic and socioeconomic risk-factors were based on the survey data.

Results.

Later life TBI was strongly associated with increased clinical AD risk in the full sample (pseudo-hazard ratio [HR]: 3.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.57–4.05) and in veteran/non-veteran males (HR: 5.31; CI: 3.42–7.94); especially those requiring high intensity/duration care (HR: 1.58; CI: 1.29–1.91). Effect magnitude decreased with time following TBI (HR: 0.72: CI: 0.68–0.80).

Conclusion.

Later life TBI was strongly associated with increased AD risk, especially in those requiring high intensity/duration care. Effect magnitude decreased with time following TBI. Univariate analysis showed no differences in AD risk between veterans and non-veterans, while the protective effect associated with veteran status in Fine-Gray models was largely due to differences in demographics, socioeconomics, and morbidity. Future longitudinal studies incorporating diagnostic procedures and documentation quantifying lifetime TBI events are necessary to uncover pathophysiological mediating and/or moderating mechanisms between TBI and AD.

pmcIntroduction

Although well-studied in high-profile groups such as career athletes1 and military personnel2–4, traumatic brain injury (TBI) is most common in older adults5–8. Late-life TBI is characterized by higher susceptibility to injury9,10 and worse post-injury outcomes8. However, these differential outcomes may be due to the higher levels of morbidity present in older individuals11, as counterfactual evidence supports the existence of good recovery trajectories in this population8. Epidemiologically, among older adults, the incidence of severe (e.g., requiring acute inpatient rehabilitation) TBI increases with age, with the highest rates found in the 80+ age group12. The condition’s pathology presents complex symptoms that require coordinated, often prolonged care by diverse healthcare providers13. A single episode of TBI is considered sufficient for the adverse effect14, and chronic pathologies following single vs multiple cases of TBI show many similarities14.

TBI is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias15–18, although dissenting opinions based on recent biologic studies question whether TBI causes AD-consistent pathologic changes and suggest that TBI, although associated with neurodegenerative processes, may not be associated with AD specifically19–21. Independent of the exact biological mechanism, the prevention of the consequences of dementia, of which AD is the most common pathologic cause22, poses the current challenge for the U.S. health system. In addition to the non-monetary burden this condition imposes on the affected individuals and their families, recent estimates place AD-associated costs at approximately $236 billion/year for formal and $216 billion/year for informal care providers23. No treatment is yet available to reverse the effects of AD-related neurodegeneration, and although the individual risk of AD onset may be decreasing24, the absolute number of people with these symptoms, as well as with notable risk-related traits, including old age and late-life TBI, are expected to increase5.

In this study, we assessed whether incident TBI after age 68 was associated with increased risk of clinical AD dementia in the general population; explored TBI as either a short-term or long-term25,26 risk factor by assessing the effect of post-TBI duration on clinical AD diagnosis; and directly compare AD risk associated with late-life TBI between male military veterans and non-veterans.

In our case, we interpret AD as the traditional clinical-pathological construct of “possible or probable AD”22 or “clinical AD dementia” rather than a more precise definition based on the presence of biologic markers27. This approach is both consistent with the historical nature of our data and reflects the fact that the majority of dementia pathologies in the brain of older adults are mixed in nature, with the relative share of mixed AD pathologies increasing with age22. Since the dementia-related burden is generated by symptoms rather than pathological mechanisms per se, this approach represents an acceptable aggregation.

Methods

Conduct of this study was approved by the University IRB.

Data on 25,881 Medicare-eligible individuals was drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and linked Medicare administrative-claims records for the 1991–2015 period. The baseline date was set at the maximum between the time an individual turned 68 or 3 years after first appearing in the Medicare enrollment files as a beneficiary with both Part A and Part B fee-for-service (FFS) coverage. Beneficiaries who spent more than 25% of their total time-series without FFS coverage, with a diagnosis of TBI/late effects of TBI, and/or clinical AD dementia (using both a strict International Classification of Disease 9th Edition [ICD-9] code-based definition of AD and a wider definition that included codes for other AD-related dementias [ADRD]) at baseline, or with missing data utilized survey-based variables were excluded.

The final sample size contained 16,829 (male and female) individuals followed until the onset of AD/ADRD, death, or censoring (December 31, 2015, or the last day of the last month with documented Medicare parts A and B FFS coverage).

Onset dates for AD/ADRD, TBI, and all other disease-related factors were constructed using previously validated algorithms based on the presence/absence of disease-specific ICD-9 codes28 (Supplementary Table S1). Demographic and socioeconomic variables drawn from the survey were defined at the interview time closest to the baseline date.

Our primary explanatory variables were the onset of the first new episode of TBI (not late effects) after age 68 and the dynamically changing length of time (in years) since that episode. We also included a proxy measure for intensity/duration of care defined as falling in the highest quartile by number of months between the earliest and latest date for healthcare claims pertaining to TBI/TBI late effects.

We corrected for both differences in baseline morbidity and for the dynamic onset (i.e., the effect enters the model at the exact age of onset) of AD-risk-related health conditions during follow-up. Baseline morbidity was assessed using a comorbidity index based on work by Elixhauser et. al.29 (excluding the following AD-risk-related conditions: uncomplicated hypertension, complicated hypertension, other neurological disorders, uncomplicated diabetes mellitus, complicated diabetes mellitus and depression). The index was calculated as the sum of the baseline indicators of all index conditions multiplied by their respective mortality coefficients derived from a supplementary Cox proportional hazards model for mortality using the entire 68+ HRS-Medicare population (see Supplementary Table S1 for ICD-9 definitions and Supplementary Table S2 for index coefficients).

Age, the most important risk factor for AD/ADRD onset, was used as a continuous timescale variable. That is, the likelihood was maximized for individuals with the same value of the timescale variable at a given follow-up time (e.g., all individuals [70, 71.25, 72.51, etc.] years old). Therefore, the effects of age in the model are accounted for non-parametrically.

We also included the following demographic and socioeconomic controls; for binary variables, the reference group is provided in parentheses: male gender (vs. female) ; Black, Hispanic or other race/ethnicity (vs. White); currently married (vs. not married for any reason); less than high-school or college education (vs. high-school/GED only); high or low economic status defined as being in the highest/lowest quartile by either wealth or income based on the entire HRS population (vs. 2nd and 3rd quartile); body-mass-index-based measures designating underweight or overweight/obese (vs. normal weight); and a linear indicator of baseline calendar time, the number of years before/after 2000, as a basic control for changes in technology and practice.

After examining the data, the overwhelming majority of veterans in the HRS were found to be male. Furthermore, male veterans (n=4,281) and non-veterans (n=3,093) differed significantly on many baseline variables (Table 1). Therefore, individual-level inverse-probability weighting (IPW) was employed using the reciprocal of the probability of being a veteran. The use of these weights ensures that the case (e.g., a male veteran) and control (e.g., male non-veteran) groups do not differ by the observed factors used in the pseudorandomization30. We used a logistic model with all study control variables as predictors for our pseudorandomization algorithm (Supplementary Table S3).

The standardized difference (Δs)31 was used to assess the inter-group differences before and after propensity-score matching. The standardized difference is not affected by differences in sample size and has the benefit of being relatable to two other measures of association, the Pearson correlation coefficient for continuous and the phi coefficient for dichotomous variables32,33. We used the criterion of |Δs|≤10% to judge whether inter-group differences were reduced to a level sufficient for further analysis. Based on this criterion, our pseudorandomization model successfully mitigated the differences between veteran and non-veteran males to comparable levels (Table 1).

We used the Fine-Gray34 competing risk model for the analysis. First, we used mortality as the only outcome (with no competing risk). This model ensured that our variables, especially those constructed from multiple measures, had the generally expected effects and that our pseudorandomization algorithm did not introduce any irregularities. We then estimated the competing-risk models for AD/ADRD risk. All analyses were repeated for three strata: i) the full unweighted sample (males and females); ii) the unweighted male-only sample; iii) the weighted male-only sample.

Results

The study-wide incidence of AD (the corresponding numbers for ADRD are provided in parentheses) in 68+ individuals was 10.4% (12.3%) for the full sample, 8.0% (9.8%) for veteran males and 8.1% (9.8%) for non-veteran males. AD (ADRD) occurred after a diagnosis of TBI occurring after age 68 in 2.4% (2.9%), 1.8% (2.2%) and 2.0% (2.4%) of each respective population. Incidence proportions of first-time TBI after age 68 were 10.2% for the full sample, 9.3% for veteran males and 8.6% for non-veteran males. Univariate analysis showed no differences in the means of these measures between veteran and non-veteran males and the associated standardized differences were below the |Δs|≤10% cut-off point even before IPW (Table 1).

Prior to IPW, veteran males were, on average, younger, less likely to be of Black, Hispanic or other race/ethnicity, and less likely to not have a high-school degree (and more likely to have a college degree). Veteran males were more likely to be married, be in the highest quartile by economic status (and less likely to be in the lowest quartile) and be in better overall health. After IPW all major differences between veteran and non-veteran males were mitigated (Table 1).

Analysis of mortality shows the expected effects for all explanatory variables (Table 2). Most notably, no association was observed between veteran status and mortality risk. TBI was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.99–2.37), but time since TBI (HR: 0.92; CI: 0.90–0.93) and having high-intensity treatment (HR: 0.40; CI: 0.32–0.50) were protective. Both the weighted and unweighted results for the male subgroup were wholly consistent with those obtained for the full sample.

TBI was associated with increased risk of AD in the full sample (pseudo-hazard ratio [pHR]: 3.22; CI: 2.57–4.05) and in veteran/non-veteran males before (pHR: 4.88; CI: 3.25–7.31) and after (pHR: 5.21; CI: 3.42–7.94) IPW. Time since the first TBI that occurred after age 68 decreased risk of AD by 17% per annum (pHR: 0.83; CI: 0.80–0.87) for the full sample, 24% per annum (pHR: 0.76; CI: 0.69–0.83) for veteran/non-veteran males prior to IPW and 28% per annum (pHR: 0.72: CI: 0.68–0.80) for veteran/non-veteran males after IPW. In contrast, TBI requiring intensive care increased risk of AD by 58% (pHR: 1.58; CI: 1.29–1.91), 44% (pHR: 1.44; CI: 1.05–1.99) and 51% (pHR: 1.51; CI: 1.08–2.12), respectively. When the broader definition of ADRD was used, only minor variation in the above effects was observed.

Prior to IPW, veteran status in males was protective. The associated pseudo-hazard ratios were lower (pHR: 0.80; CI: 0.68–0.94) in the full sample, lower (pHR: 0.76; CI: 0.63–0.91) in unweighted males and borderline (pHR: 0.85; CI: 0.72–1.00) in males after IPW. Of interest is the decline in significance of the effect after accounting for differences in demographic, socioeconomic and health-related characteristics between veterans and non-veterans, becoming insignificant when the wider definition of ADRD was used (pHR: 0.87; CI: 0.75–1.01). All other variables were included as controls and are therefore not discussed. However, the obtained effects were largely consistent with known AD risk factors.

Discussion

In this study, we confirm older-age TBI as a strong risk factor for clinical AD/ADRD diagnosis. However, we also observe that the strength of the effect diminishes with time. Using the results of the weighted AD model for veteran/non-veteran males as a benchmark, our results suggest that the increased risk of AD associated with TBI (pHR: 5.21) decreases with every passing year (pHR: 0.72) until the risk is mitigated about 5.02 years following the initial injury. If the TBI received high intensity/duration care (pHR: 1.51) the time period required for risk to be mitigated would increase to 6.28 years. This observation suggests that, at least for later-life TBI, the additional risk of AD/ADRD diagnosis is relatively short term.

Several studies have attempted to address the issue of the timeframe over which TBI leads to increased risk of AD/dementia. Fann et. al.35 analyzed a longitudinal dataset of 2.8 million individuals age 50+ from the Danish Civil Registration System with a mean follow-up of 9.89 years. TBI could have occurred at any age. They found that the association between TBI and dementia was highest within the first six months (HR: 4.06; CI: 3.79–4.34) and dropped thereafter, leveling out at about 4 years post-injury. Similar to our study, they found that for all individuals the HRs associated with TBI decreased with time since TBI, with the highest dementia risk associated with early-life TBI (age 10–20) rather than injuries sustained in later life. Similar findings were reported by Nordstrom et. al.26, who analyzed a dataset of approximately 500,000 Swedish individuals age 50+ based on the Swedish National Patient Registry with an average follow-up period of 15.3 years. They again found that although TBI showed a strong association with dementia within the first year of diagnosis (odds ratio [OR]: 2.69; CI: 3.40–3.99), the strength of this effect decreased over time, although still presenting significant additional risk (OR: 1.28; CI: 1.15–1.44) at 30 years since the initial injury. Like the Fann et al. study, Nordstrom and colleagues found that the TBI/dementia relationship was strongest in individuals diagnosed with dementia in early life (&lt;65 years).

Kornblith et. al.36 analyzed a subset of 599 male (188 veterans, 411 non-veterans) HRS respondents that completed a supplemental TBI lifetime-history questionnaire. In their study, the average age at interview for individuals reporting TBI was 67.86 years for veterans and 62.37 years for non-veterans, with the reported length of time since latest TBI equaling 37.11 and 33.89 years, respectively. This finding suggests that in our HRS-based study, elderly individuals age 68+ who had unobserved (in the Medicare records) TBI in earlier life, received the injury, on average, in their early 30s. This age is outside the range of highest risk suggested by Fann et al. and either past, or on the upper bound of early-life TBI-related risk estimated by Nordstrom and colleagues. The combined results of the above studies both provide support for the validity of our results and suggest an explanation for why some studies fail to find a relationship between TBI and dementia. For example, Grasset et. al.25 analyzed a subset of 2,718 HRS respondents (318 with TBI) over the 2000–2014 period who completed a TBI-exposure assessment in an initial 1992 interview. The study found no long-term association between a self-report of TBI in 1992 and dementia incidence/memory decline over the 2000–2014 period. In this case, the reported history of TBI would have been, consistent with Kornblith et al., an average of 30 years distant from a population designed to be 50+ in 1992 (note that the AHEAD study of much older individuals that would later be integrated into the HRS did not start until 1993). The follow-up would begin a full 8 years later, in an individual’s late 50s/early 60s. Given the timeframes involved, any risk imposed on this population by early-life TBI may have already depreciated by the time of the follow-up.

Our estimates of the study-wide prevalence of AD/ADRD in elderly Medicare beneficiaries age 68+ (10.4%/12.3%) are consistent with existing non-Medicare HRS-based estimates of the prevalence of dementia among older adults age 65+, which ranged from 8.8% in 2002 to 11.6% in 201237 as well as with estimates presented in other studies38,39. Although it was not possible to make all-gender comparisons of veterans and non-veterans directly, we were able to compare AD/ADRD prevalence between veteran and non-veteran males. We found that these differences were not statistically significant in univariate analysis (Table 2), and that the protective effect that veteran status demonstrated with respect to AD/ADRD risk in the survival-analysis portion of the study (Table 3) decreased in significance as differences in health, demographics and socioeconomic status between veterans and non-veterans was accounted for. Recent research does not directly address differences in dementia prevalence between comparable groups of veterans and civilians38. However, review of existing literature on veterans and civilians suggests that the rates of dementia in these populations may be similar37,38,40,41, and our study supports such an inference. Although Kornblith et. al.36 found that veterans demonstrated a significantly lower prevalence of early-life TBI but more than twice the prevalence of blast TBI; our findings suggest that once the increased risk of blast TBI likely associated with active military service ceases after discharge, and the demographic, socioeconomic and health-related differences between veterans and non-veterans are accounted for, there is no additional risk of TBI or AD/ADRD associated with veteran status.

Finally, of some interest are the findings surrounding our measure of treatment intensity/duration. This variable reflects the total number of months during which an individual received TBI-related care. This interval would include both individuals with multiple TBIs and those receiving multiple episodes of care for a single injury. The choice to not explicitly count the number of TBIs that occurred after age 68 was made due to the uncertainty involved in isolating when a new case of TBI occurs from the claims (especially when the claims are associated with an outpatient facility or a physician’s office rather than an inpatient stay) in a manner which would be equally valid for all possible cases. Receiving care intensity falling in the highest quartile was highly protective against mortality (Table 2), indicating that even though older adults with TBI are less likely to seek medical attention42 or be properly diagnosed43 the system may be capable of providing necessary care once a diagnosis is made. On the other hand, the effect of receiving intensive care on AD/ADRD risk is highly adverse, raising additional concerns for complex instances of a single TBI and/or multiple TBI episodes (the adverse effects of which have been well established). We note that part, but not all, of this additional risk could be due to self-determination: post-diagnosis older adults are more likely to receive head computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging.44 Consequently, the additional testing received over the course of active post-TBI care may also act to identify indications of AD/ADRD which would otherwise remain undiagnosed. Furthermore, by definition, individuals receiving high-intensity care are those that survived the immediate consequences of incident TBI, therefore some bias may be present in the reported estimates.

This work has a number of strengths. Our study is one of very few examining the risk of dementia onset after incident older-age TBI2,45 and directly comparing differences in older-life TBI/AD/ADRD rates and associated risks between veteran and civilian subgroups drawn from the same general population38. Using a combination of both survey and administrative-claims data, we were able to control for differences in a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic factors and, most vitally, for the presence of pre-TBI morbidity, which is strongly related to post-TBI outcomes8.

We also acknowledge a number of serious limitations. The nature of TBI occurring in older age46 often differs from that arising in the course of military duty, and, unlike the mostly male composition of the military in past generations, most older-life TBI patients are female8. Furthermore, the earliest possible theoretic age-time combination for an individual to be included in our study was age 68 in 1994, with the latest enrollee age 68 in 2014. These individuals would have reached age 18 in 1944 and 1964, respectively. This sample thus reduces the range of wars in which the veteran subgroup could have participated, and therefore our results may not accurately reflect injuries received during more-recent conflicts. Additionally, the presence of active wars during the lifetimes of the veterans included in this study may have introduced a survival bias, as veterans who died prior to age 68 were not available for inclusion. Due to the nature of our data, we were not able to ascertain whether TBI was associated with earlier onset AD/ADRD47,48 or to account for TBI severity (stratification of the TBI group using the Barell Matrix,49 for example, would have resulted in insufficient statistical power for use with our models). For similar reasons, we were unable to stratify our results by race/ethnicity. Only one source of claims data (Medicare) was available for this study. However, veterans also have access to the Veterans Affairs (VA) health system and these encounters are not observed. This could be particularly problematic as it may lead to a differential misclassification of the outcome by military exposure. However, since the study is focused on diagnoses that are usually made during a physician encounter (as opposed to an inpatient or outpatient procedure) and the rates of use of VA services reported by the HRS are lower in frequency than use of Medicare services, this limitation should not introduce an unacceptable level of bias. Finally, this study shares the general limitations associated with administrative-record use, including uncertainty surrounding the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD/ADRD. Indeed, the latter issue may be even more pertinent in the case of identifying TBI/AD/ADRD associations. Leaving aside the important question of whether TBI leads to AD/ADRD or a distinct TBI-related neurological disorder with similar symptoms, the short-term cognitive impairment resulting from a recent TBI may by itself introduce bias into a physician’s ability to ascertain AD/ADRD. Thereby, in a shorter time frame around a TBI, cognitive impairment imposed by the trauma may be misdiagnosed as AD/ADRD, with time, the TBI-related cognitive impairment likely improves thereby reducing the probability of an AD/ADRD diagnosis being recorded. Limitations such as these can only be overcome by the availability of more detailed neuroimaging data, both to the researcher and the bedside physician making the initial diagnosis.

Conclusion

In this study we found that although incident older-life TBI is strongly associated with clinical AD/ADRD diagnosis, the strength of this effect decreases with time. We found no differences in the study-wide risk of clinical AD/ADRD between veterans and non-veterans in univariate analysis and that any differences in risk over the course of survival analysis were likely due to differences in demographics, socioeconomics and morbidity between veterans and non-veterans at baseline rather than a reflection of a characteristic of membership in the veteran group. Our findings suggest that future longitudinal studies incorporating more complete documentation of TBI history are necessary to uncover pathophysiological mechanisms leading to increased risk of clinical AD/ADRD diagnosis. Furthermore, incorporation of diagnostic procedures (e.g., neuroimaging, blood biomarkers) and military documentation (e.g., personnel files, hospital-inpatient and health records) quantifying lifetime TBI events into claims/electronic health-record-based analysis will be invaluable in uncovering the pathophysiological mechanisms of closed and penetrating injuries mediating or moderating the development of AD/ADRD presentations.
