SUMMARY

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is the ability of neurons to exert compensatory changes in response to altered neural activity. How pathologically induced activity changes are intertwined with HSP mechanisms is unclear. We show that, in cholinergic neurons from Drosophila, beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 both induce an increase in spontaneous activity. In a transgenic line expressing Aβ42, we observe that this early increase in spontaneous activity is followed by a dramatic reduction in spontaneous events, a progression that has been suggested to occur in cholinergic brain regions of mammalian models of Alzheimer’s disease. We present evidence that the early enhancement in synaptic activity is mediated by the Drosophila α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and that, later, Aβ42-induced inhibition of synaptic events is a consequence of Dα7-dependent HSP mechanisms induced by earlier hyperactivity. Thus, while HSP may initially be an adaptive response, it may also drive maladaptive changes and downstream pathologies.

In Brief

In models of Alzheimer’s disease, Aβ peptides have been shown to induce both increases and decreases in neural activity. Hahm et al. present evidence that an early Aβ-induced enhancement in cholinergic activity, mediated by the α7 nAChR, triggers endogenous homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that result in downstream synaptic silencing.

Graphical Abstract


INTRODUCTION

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) is the ability of neurons to exert compensatory changes in synaptic strength in response to altered neural activity, thereby maintaining activity within an optimal range (Davis, 2006; Marder and Goaillard, 2006; Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008; Pozo and Goda, 2010; Turrigiano, 2008, 2011). HSP has been suggested to play a neuroprotective role during times of activity change, such as during development or during pathological conditions that alter neural activity. In models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), studies have shown that beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides have many effects, including the alteration of neural activity. Intriguingly, reported changes include both increases and decreases in neural activity. For example, many studies have shown that Aβ results in a decrease in synaptic activity (Hsia et al., 1999; Hsieh et al., 2006; Kamenetz et al., 2003; Oddo et al., 2003; Selkoe, 2002; Zhang et al., 2009), while other reports suggest that Aβ expression leads to increases in neuronal excitability (Brown et al., 2011; Busche et al., 2008, 2012; Davis et al., 2014; Hartley et al., 1999; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008; Minkeviciene et al., 2009; Palop et al., 2007). Some AD models have shown increases and decreases in spontaneous Ca2+ activity in different subpopulations of neurons in AD models (Busche et al., 2008, 2012; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008). While seemingly contradictory, opposing changes in activity might also be dynamically coupled.

Aβ has also been suggested to induce opposing changes in activity in cholinergic regions of the mammalian brain. Cholinergic activity has long been known to be reduced in AD, contributing to the cognitive decline of patients; this has been referred to as the “cholinergic hypothesis” (Bartus et al., 1982; Coyle et al., 1983; Small and Fodero, 2002; Terry and Buccafusco, 2003). Evidence, however, suggests that the decline in cholinergic signaling occurs at later stages and that cholinergic activity is actually enhanced at earlier stages of AD (Frölich, 2002; Nordberg, 2001; Small and Fodero, 2002), with increased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (DeKosky et al., 2002) and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Dineley et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2013). Numerous reports have shown that the Aβ1-42 species (Aβ42) directly binds the α7 nAChR (Søderman et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2000a, 2000b), leading to changes in its activity (reviewed in Lombardo and Maskos, 2015; Oz et al., 2013; Parri et al., 2011); interestingly, evidence points to Aβ42 both increasing and inhibiting α7 nAChRs. α7 nAChRs have also been shown to facilitate the Aβ-induced increase in acetylcholine esterase (AChE) (Fodero et al., 2004). Thus, cholinergic neurons in the mammalian brain appear to experience dynamic changes in activity, which may progress in a manner intertwined with, and dependent on, endogenous HSP mechanisms.

At the human neuromuscular junction (NMJ), myasthenia-gravis-affected endplates were shown to exhibit increased transmitter release (Cull-Candy et al., 1980), suggesting HSP at the diseased cholinergic NMJ. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that nAChRs may mediate HSP in multiple neurological conditions. Virtually all studies on synaptic homeostasis though have been performed on glutamatergic synapses (Davis, 2006; Marder and Goaillard, 2006; Nelson and Turrigiano, 2008; Pozo and Goda, 2010; Turrigiano, 2008, 2011). In our previous study, however, we used the predominantly cholinergic CNS of Drosophila as a model to examine whether nAChRs can also mediate a homeostatic response to prolonged inhibition of synaptic activity (Ping and Tsunoda, 2011). We found that the Drosophila α7 (Dα7) nAChR was selectively upregulated after cholinergic blockade, thereby increasing synaptic strength (Ping and Tsunoda, 2011). In a more recent study, HSP was also demonstrated to occur at the cholinergic NMJ of rodents (Wang etal., 2018).

In this report, we use a transgenic Drosophila line that overexpresses a secreted form of the human Aβ42 peptide as a model to examine the effects of Aβ42 on cholinergic synaptic function and to gain insight into the potential role of homeostatic mechanisms driving Aβ-induced adaptive and maladaptive changes in cholinergic activity. These flies exhibit many of the pathogenic hallmarks associated with AD (Finelli et al., 2004; Iijima et al., 2004, 2008; Ping et al., 2015). We show that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 induce an early enhancement in spontaneous cholinergic synaptic events and that this increased activity is followed by a subsequent reduction in spontaneous events, a progression that parallels what has been suggested to occur in cholinergic regions of mammalian AD models. Based on our data, we propose a model in which enhanced spontaneous synaptic transmission, which may be induced by either Aβ40 or Aβ42, triggers a Dα7-dependent homeostatic response, resulting in downstream synaptic inhibition.

RESULTS

Aβ42 Exerts an Early Increase in Cholinergic Synaptic Activity Followed by Downstream Synaptic Inhibition

To examine how Aβ42 affects cholinergic neuronal activity, we used a transgenic Drosophila line expressing human Aβ42 fused to an N-terminal rat pre-proenkephalin signal peptide that directs cleavage of the signal sequence and extracellular secretion of Aβ42 (Finelli et al., 2004), mimicking human Aβ42 accumulation in the extracellular space around neurons. This sequence was placed under the control of an upstream activating sequence (UAS), such that the UAS-GAL4 system in Drosophila (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) can be used for tissue-specific expression of the UAS-Aβ42 transgene (Iijima et al., 2008). Indeed, pan-neuronal expression of UAS-Aβ42 with the elav-GAL4 driver (genotype: elav-GAL4;UAS-Aβ42/+, also referred to as elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42) has been reported to induce extracellular amyloid deposits, age-dependent learning and locomotor defects, progressive neurodegeneration, and premature death (Finelli et al., 2004; Iijima et al., 2004, 2008; Ping etal., 2015). Since Drosophila central neurons are predominantly cholinergic, we use them as a model for how Aβ42 affects cholinergic synaptic activity.

We first investigated effects of Aβ42 in the aging brain. We recorded spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSCs) from a known neuronal type, the antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) in the intact Drosophila brain, at 0–2 days and 9–13 days after eclosion (AE). Flies were collected, aged at 25°C, and brains were acutely dissected in an ex vivo preparation for recording. sEPSCs included all spontaneous events recorded in voltage-clamp mode as a general gauge of neuronal activity. We found that spontaneous transmission was enhanced in elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 flies at 0–2 days AE with an average inter-event time of 2,439.60 ± 1,182.44 ms, compared to 5,579.67 ± 1,804.34 ms recorded from age-matched control brains (Figure 1). In contrast, at 9–13 days AE, neurons from elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 flies displayed a reduction in the frequency of spontaneous events, with inter-event times (2,161.49 ± 624.18 ms) 70% greater than age-matched wild-type flies (1,256.57 ± 263.68 ms) (Figure 1).

These opposing changes are intriguing because mammalian Aβ models have also been reported to exhibit both increases and decreases in spontaneous activity; however, little is known about how these opposing effects are induced and how they are related. Since previous studies using this transgenic line have shown that significant neuronal loss is not observed in Aβ42-expressing brains until 25 days AE (Iijima et al., 2004; Ping et al., 2015), the decrease in synaptic activity seen at 9–13 days AE may be due to synaptic dysfunction that precedes neuronal death. Since in vitro experimental conditions would allow for pharmacological as well as genetic manipulation, we tested whether similar activity changes could be observed in primary neurons cultured from the same genetic lines. We cultured neurons from the elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 transgenic line and examined changes in spontaneous synaptic events over days in vitro (DIV). These neurons are among the most well characterized neurons in Drosophila with respect to voltage-dependent channels and synaptic physiology (Lee and O’Dowd, 1999, 2000; Leung et al., 1989; Ping et al., 2011, 2015; Ping and Tsunoda, 2011; Tsunoda and Salkoff, 1995a, 1995b).

We compared sEPSCs from cultured neurons at 5 and 9 days DIV. We found that spontaneous events in Aβ42-expressing cultures were indeed differentially affected at 5 and 9 DIV compared to activity in age-matched control cultures. At 5 DIV, the frequency of spontaneous events was significantly increased in neurons from elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 cultures compared to wild-type. Inter-event times of sEPSCs in neurons from Aβ42-expressing cultures were reduced by 36% compared to control neurons, and amplitudes of spontaneous events were increased by 33% (Figure 2); waveforms of sEPSCs were similar (Figure 2D). In contrast, at 9 DIV, the frequency of spontaneous events in elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 neurons was significantly reduced, with inter-event times nearly four times greater than those recorded in wild-type (Figure 3A). Amplitudes of sEPSCs were reduced by 25% (Figure 3B). sEPSC waveforms from Aβ42-neurons also had faster decay times (control [Ctrl], 1.66 ± 0.11 ms; Aβ42, 1.08 ± 0.11 ms) and shorter half-width times (Ctrl, 1.91 ± 0.11 ms; Aβ42,1.39 ± 0.12 ms) (Figure 3D). Together, our results suggest that Aβ42 induces an early increase in spontaneous synaptic transmission that is followed by downstream inhibition of this activity and that primary neurons in culture exhibit this same progression of activity changes. Using primary neurons as a model, we set out to investigate the underlying mechanisms of how Aβ42-induced signaling defects progress over time.

Pre- and Postsynaptic Contributions to Early and Late Aβ42 Effects

To investigate whether the early Aβ42 enhancement in spontaneous synaptic events is induced pre- and/or postsynaptically, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in neurons from wild-type and elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 cultures at 5 DIV. mEPSCs were isolated as spontaneous tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive events, which are widely used as a measure of the postsynaptic response to single units of neurotransmitter; these events have also been defined in particular in Drosophila neurons (Lee and O’Dowd, 1999). We assayed mEPSC frequency and amplitude/shape kinetics as conventional indicators of a pre- and/or postsynaptic effect, respectively. We found that the frequency of mEPSCs was increased in neurons from Aβ42-expressing cultures compared to age-matched Ctrls (Figure 4A). Average inter-event time in neurons from Aβ42-expressing cultures (822.47 ± 29.98 ms) was reduced to 41% of inter-event times seen in wild-type neurons (1,983.54 ± 118.04 ms). Previously, we reported that Aβ42-expressing cultures do not exhibit any gross differences in health or growth/extension of neuronal processes (Ping et al., 2015), so we suggest that this increased frequency of events in Aβ42-neurons is more likely due to a change in presynaptic function. In contrast, mEPSC amplitudes recorded in neurons from Aβ42-expressing cultures (5.23 ± 0.29 pA) were not significantly different from those recorded in wild-type neurons (6.05 ± 0.43 pA) (Figure 4B). We further examined whether the kinetics of mEPSCs were altered by Aβ42 expression. We analyzed the rise time (10%–90%), decay time, half-width, charge transfer, and decay kinetics of mEPSCs. We found no significant difference in any of these measurements (Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, the Aβ42-induced increase in spontaneous activity observed at 5 DIV is likely due primarily to a presynaptic effect.

To further confirm these results, we generated a transgenic line in which the elav promoter is directly fused to the same human Aβ42 sequence containing an N-terminal rat pre-proenkephalin signal peptide; this transgene is referred to as elav-Aβ42. We found that neurons from elav-Aβ42 cultures also displayed a dramatic enhancement in mEPSC frequency at 5 DIV compared to age-matched Ctrls, with inter-event times (799.26 ± 32.24 ms) similar to those recorded from elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 neurons (822.47 ± 29.98 ms) (Figure 4A), with no differences in amplitude (Figure 4B). This second, independent transgenic line further confirms that the early Aβ42-induced increase in activity is enacted presynaptically.

At 9 DIV, we found that neurons from both Aβ42-expressing lines, elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 and elav-Aβ42, exhibit a significant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous events. To examine whether this inhibition is induced pre- and/or postsynaptically, we again analyzed mEPSCs for a change in frequency and/or amplitude/shape, respectively. The frequency of mEPSCs from either of the Aβ42-expressing lines was the most significantly altered, with average inter-event times of 1,373.52 ± 72.64 ms (elav-Aβ42) or 1,788.09 ± 78.71 ms (elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42), which were 40%−80% times greater than inter-event times of Ctrl neurons (989.51 ± 51.29 ms) (Figure 5A). These results suggest an underlying presynaptic change. mEPSCs from either of the Aβ42-expressing cultures showed no difference in amplitude when compared to age-matched Ctrl neurons (Figure 5B). Kinetic analyses of mEPSCs also showed no differences between 9 DIV Ctrl and Aβ42-expressing neurons for rise times, half-widths, or total charge transfer (Figure 5C). When decay kinetics, however, were fit with a double exponential equation, we found that the relative contribution of the fast component was decreased in Aβ42 neurons (Figure 5D), suggesting some (perhaps more minor) postsynaptic alteration.

The Dα7 nAChR Mediates Aβ42-Induced Hyperactivity

To investigate the mechanism underlying the Aβ42-induced increase in spontaneous synaptic events seen at 5 DIV, we first considered the Dα7 nAChR. Aβ42 has been shown to associate with the mammalian α7 nAChR (Søderman et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2000a, 2000b), inducing changes in receptor activity (reviewed in Lombardo and Maskos, 2015; Oz et al., 2013; Parri et al., 2011). In addition, α7 nAChRs have been shown to localize to presynaptic as well as postsynaptic sites (Duffy et al., 2009; Fabian-Fine etal., 2001; Jones etal., 2004; Jones and Wonnacott, 2004; Levy and Aoki, 2002; Lubin et al., 1999; Pakkanen et al., 2005). We first examined whether Aβ42 co-localizes in our preparation with Dα7 nAChRs. We used the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 transgene to drive expression of a UAS-Dα7-EGFP transgene. Aβ42 (500 nM) was applied to cultures soon after dissociation; at 5 DIV, cultures were fixed and immunostained for Aβ42 and Dα7-EGFP. We found that Aβ42 was localized both intra- and extracelluarly, often in puncta, to Dα7-EGFP positive membranes of neuronal somas and processes (Figure 6A).

We next tested whether acute exogenously applied Aβ42 could increase spontaneous synaptic activity similar to the early effects we observed in 5 DIV elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 neurons. We applied Aβ42 peptide to wild-type cultures at 5 DIV and examined whether there were any acute effects on the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events. Aβ42 peptide was prepared in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2(iso)-propanol (HFIP) to prevent aggregation. When ready, peptide was diluted in DMSO and allowed to oligomerize for 24 hr at 4°C. Peptide was then diluted further and added to culture media for 30 min. Media was then washed out and replaced with bath solution for recording; recordings were made over the next 60 min. We found that application of low concentrations of Aβ42 (2.5 nM) more than doubled the frequency of sEPSCs (average inter-event time: 1,21.11 ± 1.51 ms) compared to mock-treatment (average inter-event time: 255.13 ± 4.61 ms) (Figure 6B). For comparison, we examined Aβ40 and found that Aβ40 also induced an increase in sEPSC frequency (Figure 6B). Interestingly, when we tested higher concentrations of Aβ42/Aβ40 (10 nM), we found that Aβ42, but not Aβ40, greatly suppressed the frequency of spontaneous events, with an average inter-event time of 708.17 ± 48.6 ms (Figure 6B). Our results suggest that either Aβ40 or Aβ42 may induce an increase in cholinergic activity but that the local concentration of Aβ42 in particular may also contribute to differential effects on activity.

We then examined if the effects of Aβ42 were mediated by the Dα7 nAChR. To do this, we mock/Aβ42-treated cultures made from the Dα7 null mutant line, Dα7PΔEY6. In the absence of Dα7 nAChRs alone, the frequency of spontaneous events was greatly reduced, consistent with the idea that Dα7 nAChRs are a major contributor to synaptic function. We then tested whether low (2.5 nM) or high (10 nM) concentrations of Aβ42 were able to affect spontaneous synaptic events in the absence of Dα7 nAChRs. We found that 2.5 nM Aβ42 was unable to enhance the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events as in Ctrl neurons (Figure 6B), suggesting that Aβ42-induced increases in spontaneous activity are mediated by Dα7 nAChRs; in contrast, 10 nM Aβ42 further silenced spontaneous synaptic transmission even in the absence of Dα7 nAChRs (Figure 6B).

Early Enhancement of Cholinergic Activity Induces Synaptic Inhibition in Wild-Type Neurons

One possibility is that the early Aβ42-induced increase in synaptic activity at 5 DIV triggers endogenous HSP mechanisms that generate the suppression of spontaneous activity we see at 9 DIV. We first tested whether an increase in synaptic activity in wild-type neurons could indeed trigger HSP mechanisms that would result in a reduction of synaptic events. We used the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor ambenonium (Amb) to transiently increase cholinergic synaptic activity in wild-type cultures around 5 DIV. Amb (1 μM) was applied to the culture media of 4 DIV wild-type cultures, and then at 6 DIV, Amb was washed out and replaced with normal media; mock-treated cultures underwent the same mechanical wash and exchange of media/recording solution. Mock treatment was important, since disturbance to the cultures alone caused an increase in spontaneous events. At 9 DIV, we recorded sEPSCs from mock- and Amb-treated cultures. We found that if neurons were treated with Amb at 4–6 DIV, they indeed exhibited a reduction in the frequency of spontaneous events at 9 DIV, with inter-event times (12,227.07 ± 2,546.2 ms) that were 36 times greater than inter-event times recorded in mock-treated neurons (333.63 ± 6.33 ms) (Figure 7A). These results demonstrate that increasing cholinergic signaling, even transiently, can downregulate the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity seen days later.

Since our results suggested that Dα7 nAChRs mediate Aβ-induced enhancement of spontaneous activity (Figure 6), we next tested whether this Amb-induced response also requires Dα7 nAChRs. Similar to experiments with wild-type, we mock or Amb treated Dα7PΔEY6 null mutant cultures from 4 to 6 DIV and then recorded sEPSCs at 9 DIV. Mock-treated Dα7PΔEY6 mutant neurons again showed a reduced frequency of spontaneous events compared to mock-treated wild-type neurons, further confirming that a significant amount of synaptic activity is mediated by Dα7 nAChRs (Figures 6B and 7B). Amb-treated Dα7PΔEY6 neurons showed no activity-induced inhibition of spontaneous transmission and actually exhibited an increased frequency of events, with average inter-event times of 846.75 ± 33.88 ms and 663.20 ± 20.81 ms for mock- and Amb-treated Dα7PΔEY6 cultures, respectively (Figure 7B). These results indicate that the homeostatic response induced with Amb in wild-type neurons requires the Dα7 nAChR.

Early Aβ42-Induced Enhancement in Synaptic Activity Is a Prerequisite for the Later Inhibition of Spontaneous Synaptic Events

The silencing of synaptic events in wild-type neurons by early application of Amb suggests that an early Aβ42-induced increase in synaptic activity may be triggering endogenous HSP mechanisms that contribute to the downstream decline in synaptic transmission observed at 9 DIV in Aβ42-expressing cultures. To more directly test this, we set out to transiently inhibit the early increase in synaptic activity in elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 cultures, then test for later attenuation of spontaneous synaptic events. We used curare (1 μM) to block cholinergic activity during the time we had observed a clear increase in spontaneous activity in Aβ42-expressing cultures. Curare was added early to cultures (from 4 to 6 DIV) and then washed out; mock-treated cultures underwent the same mechanical perturbation. We then recorded sEPSCs at 9 DIV. We found that the frequency of sEPSCs from early curare-treated Aβ42-expressing cultures was not inhibited as it was in mock-treated Aβ42-expressing cultures; the average inter-event duration in mock-treated Aβ42-expressing cultures was 2,617.98 ± 394.46 ms, while early curare-treated cultures exhibited an average inter-event duration of only 230.28 ± 5.00 ms (Figure 7C). Indeed, early curare-treated neurons had an average inter-event duration that was similar to mock-treated Ctrl neurons (333.63 ± 6.33 ms; Figure 7A), demonstrating that blocking early cholinergic activity in Aβ42-expressing neurons restored the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events to wild-type levels at 9 DIV.

Early Transient Application of Aβ42 Is Sufficient to Induce Dα7-Dependent Synaptic Inhibition at Later Stages

Finally, we tested whether transient application of 2.5 nM Aβ42 to wild-type cultures at an early stage would be sufficient to induce later synaptic inhibition at 9 DIV. As shown in Figure 6B, acute application of 2.5 nM Aβ42 results in a significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events. We applied Aβ42 peptide (2.5 nM) to 4 DIV wild-type cultures for 40–60 min and then washed out the peptide and replaced with normal media. We then recorded sEPSCs 5 days later (at 9 DIV). Indeed, Aβ42-treated neurons displayed a dramatic reduction in frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity, with an average interevent time of 2,832.99 ± 300.78 ms, which was more than three times greater than the average inter-event times recorded in mock-treated neurons (830.84 ± 48.96 ms) (Figure 7D). These results suggest that an early, even transient exposure to Aβ42 is sufficient to induce synaptic silencing days later.

Since the acute Aβ42-induced increase in synaptic activity was abolished in Dα7PΔEY6 null mutants (Figure 6B), we next tested if the synaptic inhibition observed after early transient application of Aβ42 is dependent on Dα7 nAChRs. At 4 DIV, mock/Aβ42 (2.5 nM) treatment was transiently applied to Dα7PΔEY6 mutant neurons, similar to experiments run with wild-type neurons. At 9 DIV, we recorded sEPSCs. In contrast to wild-type neurons, the frequency of sEPSCs was not inhibited (Figure 7D). Inter-event times in Aβ42-treated Dα7PΔEY6 neurons (703.29 ± 35.44 ms) were actually slightly reduced compared to mock-treated Dα7PΔEY6 neurons (886.64 ± 51.41 ms) (Figure 7D). Altogether, our results support a model in which Aβ peptides induce an initial increase in cholinergic synaptic activity that is mediated by Dα7 nAChRs, and that it is this hyperactivity that underlies downstream synaptic silencing.

DISCUSSION

It is becoming increasingly clear that neural activity is altered in many AD models, with both increases and decreases in activity reported (Brown et al., 2011; Busche et al., 2008, 2012; Hartley et al., 1999; Hsia et al., 1999; Hsieh et al., 2006; Kamenetz et al., 2003; Kuchibhotla et al., 2008; Minkeviciene et al., 2009; Oddo et al., 2003; Palop et al., 2007; Selkoe, 2002; Zhang et al., 2009). Here, we examined the effect of human Aβ40 and Aβ42 on cholinergic neurons from Drosophila. Effects on cholinergic neurons are likely to be important, since cholinergic regions of the mammalian basal forebrain have long been known to be especially affected in AD (Arendt et al., 1988; Mufson et al., 1989a, 1989b; Mufson and Kordower, 1989; Oz et al., 2013; Whitehouse et al., 1981). We show that both Aβ40 and Aβ42 induce an increase in spontaneous synaptic events. In a transgenic model expressing Aβ42, early hyperactivity is followed by a dramatic reduction in the frequency of spontaneous events. To assay synaptic strength, mEPSCs were isolated as the subset of sEPSCs that represent post-synaptic responses to single units of neurotransmitter released. In vitro, mEPSC frequencies from Ctrl neurons increase overtime, likely due to growth/extension of neuronal processes and the formation of more synaptic contacts. In contrast, neuronal cultures expressing Aβ42 exhibit mEPSC frequencies higher than Ctrls at early times and dramatically reduced at later times. These results may be explained by an effect of Aβ42 either on the number of synaptic contacts or on presynaptic function and synaptic strength. Since Ctrl and Aβ42-expressing cultures are indistinguishable in their general growth over time (Ping et al., 2015), we suggest that Aβ42 more likely modulates presynaptic function. As discussed later, the potential target of Aβ42 in this scenario may be presynaptic Dα7 nAChRs.

The progression of opposing changes in spontaneous activity that we observe is interesting, because it parallels what has been suggested to occur in cholinergic brain regions of mammalian AD models (Albuquerque etal., 2009; DeKoskyetal., 2002; Dineley et al., 2001; Frölich, 2002; Nordberg, 2001; Small and Fodero, 2002). We use this model to investigate a potential homeostatic relationship between these changes. Roles for HSP in AD have been previously suggested. For example, it was proposed over a decade ago that Aβ-induced synaptic damage/loss may lead to a homeostatic increase in cholinergic signaling, manifested for example in increases in α7 nAChRs and ChAT (DeKosky et al., 2002; Dineley et al., 2002). This homeostatic response has been proposed to initially protect the system from cognitive decline (Hernandez et al., 2010; Pratt et al., 2011; Small, 2004, 2007) but eventually facilitate later neurodegeration (Small, 2004, 2008). More recently, studies have reported that synaptic scaling itself is impaired in mouse AD models (reviewed in Jang and Chung, 2016). In one study, neurons failed to undergo normal homeostatic changes that shift the relative thresholds of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) during development (Megill et al., 2015). In another study, PS1−/− mice displayed impaired synaptic scaling at excitatory synapses (Pratt et al., 2011).

In this study, we address the question of whether the opposing, and sequential, effects of Aβ42 on spontaneous cholinergic synaptic events are homeostatically related. We propose that HSP mechanisms drive the progression of Aβ-induced activity changes. We show that the synaptic inhibition ultimately exhibited in Drosophila neurons at later times can be mimicked or blocked by either increasing early synaptic activity in wild-type or inhibiting the early enhanced synaptic activity in Aβ42-expressing neurons, respectively. Thus, early Aβ-induced increases in activity may trigger endogenous HSP mechanisms that generate the synaptic inhibition associated with cognitive/motor dysfunction. A similar sequence may occur in hAPP transgenic mice, in which high levels of Aβ induced seizure-like activity in cortical and hippocampal neurons that were suggested to then induce synaptic inhibition via the enhancement of GABAergic signaling (Palop et al., 2007).

We find that Aβ42-induced enhancement in activity and the homeostatic response that generates the later synaptic inhibition both depend on the Dα7 nAChR. Interestingly, the mammalian α7 nAChR has been widely implicated in Aβ pathophysiology. For example, in mammalian Aβ models, studies have shown that learning impairment correlates well with an increase in α7 nAChRs (Dineley et al., 2002) and that knockout of the α7 nAChR either protected against (Dziewczapolski et al., 2009) or enhanced (Hernandez et al., 2010) learning and memory deficits. Given that α7 nAChRs have been shown to directly bind Aβ42 (Søderman et al., 2008; Tong et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2000a, 2000b) and have a high permeability to Ca2+ (Albuquerque et al., 2009; Bertrand et al., 1993; Castro and Albuquerque, 1995; Dougherty et al., 2003; Gotti et al., 2009; Séguéla et al., 1993), our data support a model in which Aβ42 directly acts on presynaptic Dα7 nAChRs, upregulating the frequency of neurotransmitter release. Indeed, mammalian α7 nAChRs have been reported to be key facilitators of Aβ-induced effects on presynaptic Ca2+ entry (Mehta et al., 2009; Tong et al., 2011), presynaptic release (Wu et al., 2007), and various types of synaptic plasticity including LTP and short-term depression (STD) (Gu et al., 2012; Gu and Yakel, 2011; Puzzo et al., 2008). We show that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are both capable of enhancing the frequency of spontaneous events and that Dα7 nAChRs are required for an activity-dependent homeostatic response, as well as the progression of Aβ42-induced effects on cholinergic activity, ultimately leading to synaptic silencing. Future studies will need to investigate the pathway by which early Dα7-dependent enhancement in synaptic transmission triggers a subsequent downregulation in presynaptic release.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Fly Stocks

w1118 or genetic background strains were used as Ctrl lines in this study. We used the previously generated mutant and transgenic lines UAS-Aβ42/CyO (Finelli et al., 2004; Iijima et al., 2004, 2008) and UAS-Dα7-EGFP and Dα7PΔEY6 (Fayyazuddin et al., 2006). For the elav-Aβ42 line, the human Aβ42 sequence fused to an N-terminal rat pre-proenkephalin signal peptide was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from the UAS-Aβ42 transgenic line (Finelli et al., 2004; Iijima et al., 2004,2008) using primers containing Not I and Asc 1 restriction sites and then subcloned into the pCaST-elavGAL4DBD transformation vector (kindly provided by Dr. F. Diao; Luan et al., 2006); in subcloning, the Aβ42 sequence replaced the GAL4DBD downstream of the elav promoter. The newly constructed pCaST-elav-Aβ42 was microinjected by Rainbow Transgenics (Camarillo, CA)with transposase into w1118 embryos. Transformants were identified, and transgenes were mapped and balanced by standard procedures.

Ex Vivo Preparation and Electrophysiological Recording from the Intact Adult Brain

Brains from flies aged at 25°C were removed from the fly head in recording saline containing 101 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM glucose, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, and 20.7 mM NaHCO3 (pH 7.2, 250 mOsm). Acutely dissected brains were incubated in Stem Cell Pro Accutase (GIBCO) for 5–10 min, to soften the connective tissue sheath surrounding the brain and then washed again in recording saline. Brains were then transferred to a glass-bottom chamber for physiological recording. In the recording chamber, the brain was held in place by a metal harp using a small-diameter glass pipette or fine forceps. Each brain was allowed to rest in continuously flowing oxygenated saline (95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide) for at least 10 min before recording. Oxygenated saline was supplied throughout the recording period. PNs were identified by eye using known anatomical landmarks and comparisons with brains expressing GFP-labeled PNs (GH146-GAL4&gt;&gt;GFP). All recordings were done at room temperature. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed with pipettes (8–12 MΩ) filled with internal solution containing 102 mM K-gluconate, 0.085 mM CaCl2,1.7 mM MgCl2, 17 mM NaCl, 0.94 mM EGTA, and 8.5 mM HEPES (pH 7.2, 235 mOsm). Recordings were made using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, Axon Digidata 1550, and pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices).

in Vitro Electrophysiological Experiments from Primary Neurons

For neuronal cultures, single embryos aged 5–6 hr (at room temperature) were dissociated in drop cultures of 20 μL culture medium, as previously described (Ping and Tsunoda, 2011; Tsunoda and Salkoff, 1995a, 1995b). Cultures were grown for up to 2 weeks in a humidified chamber at room temperature. Whole-cell recordings were performed in perforated patch-clamp configuration by adding 400–800 μg/mL Amphotericin-B (Sigma-Aldrich) in the pipette, as reported previously (Ping and Tsunoda, 2011; Ping et al., 2011). We used external solution containing 140 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM CaCl2, and 6 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.2). For mEPSC recordings, TTX (1 μM) was added to the external solution to block voltage-dependent Na+ channels. Electrodes were filled with internal solution containing 120 mM K-gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 4 mM ATP-Mg (pH 7.2). All recordings were performed at room temperature. Pipette resistances for all recordings were 10–25 MΩ. Gigaohm seals were obtained for whole-cell recordings. Data were acquired and analyzed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, Axon Digidata 1550, and pClamp 10 software. Recordings were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using a low-pass Bessel filter.

Analyses and Statistical Methods

sEPSC and mEPSC events in electrophysiological recordings were identified using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft), followed by manual verification by eye; inter-event times, amplitudes, and kinetics were analyzed using Mini Analysis. For event mEPSC amplitudes, events were grouped per cell, and average amplitudes were used across cells. For sEPSC amplitudes and all inter-event times, all events were analyzed together. Q-tests were used to identify outliers, and averaged data are presented as mean ± SEM, with number of events per cell noted; significance (*p &lt; 0.05) was determined using the Student’s t test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov 2-sample test. Presentation of graphs and representative traces utilized Origin (Microcal Software), Photoshop (Adobe), and lllustrator (Adobe).

Immunostaining Primary Cultures

Cultures were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, blocked (1% BSA or 5% goat serum, 0.1% saponin in PBS) for 30 min, and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Antibodies against the following proteins were used at the indicated concentrations: GFP, 1:500 (Torrey Pines Biolabs); Aβ42, 1:500 (6E10, Covance). After 4 washes (0.1% saponin in PBS, 5 min each), we incubated cultures with Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000–2,000; Life Technologies) at room temperature for 1 hr, washed them again, and then mounted them in p-phenylenediamine in 90% glycerol. We imaged Ctrl and treated cultures with a 60Δ oil-immersion objective using Zeiss Apotome technology to obtain optical sections. Images were acquired with Zen Blue (2012) software (Zeiss) and processed for figure using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

Aβ Peptide Preparation

Lyophilized synthetic human Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Anaspec) (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL HFIP to prevent aggregation, portioned into 10-μg aliquots, air-dried, and frozen at −80°C. When ready to use, an Aβ aliquot was thawed at room temperature for 30 min and then dissolved in 10 μL DMSO followed by 78.6 μL culture media, making a 25 μM solution. This solution was incubated at 4°C for 24 hr and then diluted to final concentration for use in experiments. This procedure was modeled after a protocol from Stine et al. (2003).

Note that mEPSCs from both elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 and w;elav-Aβ42 lines show increased activity with significantly reduced inter-event times (822.47 ± 29.98 ms and 799.26 ± 32.24 ms, respectively) compared to Ctrl (1,983.54 ± 118.04 ms); inter-event times between elav;Aβ42 and w;elav-Aβ42 were not significantly different (ns). *p &lt; 0.05 (Student’s t test).

(C) Analyses of rise times, decay times, half-widths, and charge transfer showed no difference between Ctrl and elav;Aβ42.

(D) mEPSC decay kinetics fit with a double exponential showed no differences in fast/slow time constants (tau1 and tau2) or the relative contribution of each to the decay (A1/(A1 + A2) for the fast component, and A2/(A1 + A2) for the slow component).

(E) Representative traces of each genotype shown. For Ctrl, n = 4,437 events from 13 cells; for elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42, n = 4,814 events from 8 cells; for w;elav-Aβ42, n = 3,950 from 11 cells. Scale bar, 50 ms/5 pA.

Note that mEPSCs from both elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 and w;elav-Aβ42 lines show decreased activity with significantly enhanced interevent times (1,788.09 ± 78.71 ms and 1,373.52 ± 72.64 ms, respectively) compared to Ctrl (989.51 ± 51.29 ms).

(C) Analyses of rise times, decay times, half-widths, and charge transfer showed a reduced decay time (90%–37%) in elav;Aβ42 neurons compared to age-matched Ctrl neurons.

(D) mEPSC decay kinetics fit with a double exponential showed no differences in fast or slow time constants (tau1 and tau2), but the relative contribution of the fast component (A1/(A1 + A2)) was reduced in elav;Aβ42 neurons, and the relative contribution of the slow component (A2/(A1 + A2)) was increased. This results in a sharpened current without a change in charge transfer.

Figure 6. Aβ42 Co-localizes with Dα7-EGFP in Neurons, and Acute Application of Aβ42 Induces a Dα7-Dependent Enhancement in Synaptic Activity in 5 DIV Neurons

(A) Primary elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Dα7-EGFP cultures were treated from 0 to 5 DIV with 500 nM Aβ42. Cultures were then fixed and immunostained for anti-GFP (green) and anti-Aβ42 (red). Shown are representative optical sections through typically round neuronal cell bodies that grow in small clusters (top) and neuronal processes; merged images show overlap (yellow) between Dα7-EGFP and Aβ42 localization in membrane of somas and processes. Scale bars, 2 μm.

(B) Representative spontaneous EPSCs and quantification of inter-event times are shown after mock or exogenous application of Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptide to Ctrl or Dα7PΔEY6 mutant (Dα7−/−) cultures at 5 DIV; Vm = −70 mV. In Ctrl neurons, 2.5 nM Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptide resulted in a decrease in inter-event time (93.67 ± 0.74 ms and 121.11 ± 1.51 ms, respectively; n = 6 cells) compared to mock-treated neurons (255.13 ± 4.61 ms; n = 9 cells). At higher concentration (10 nM), Aβ42, but not Aβ40, induced a significant increase in interevent time (708.17 ± 48.64 ms; n = 10 cells). In Dα7−/−, 2.5 nM Aβ42 failed to induce an increase in spontaneous activity (1,050.80 ± 41.01 ms; n = 8 cells) compared to mock-treated (948.32 ± 41.46 ms; n = 9 cells). *p &lt; 0.05 (Student’s t test) between indicated groups.

Figure 7. Increasing Early Cholinergic Activity Is Sufficient to Induce Synaptic Inhibition in Wild-Type, and Blocking Early Activity in Aβ42-Cultures Prevents the Development of Synaptic Inhibition

Representative spontaneous EPSCs (Vm = −70 mV) and quantification of inter-event times are shown (A–D).

(A) The acetylcholine esterase inhibitor, ambenonium (Amb; 1 μM), was applied to wild-type cultures from 4 to 6 DIV, and then sEPSCs were recorded at 9 DIV; mock-treated cultures underwent the same mechanical perturbations as Amb-treated cultures. sEPSCs in Amb-treated neurons exhibited a greatly reduced frequency, with increased inter-event times (12,227.07 ± 2546.88 ms; n = 7 cells) compared to mock treated (333.63 ± 6.33 ms; n = 8 cells).

(B) Cultures from the Dα7PΔEY6 null mutant were mock or Amb treated from 4 to 6 DIV; at 9 DIV, sEPSCs were recorded. Amb treatment did not increase interevent times as in wild-type; rather, a relative decrease in inter-event times was observed (mock treated, 846.75 ± 33.88 ms, n = 11 cells; Amb treated, 663.20 ± 20.81 ms, n = 10 cells).

(C) elav-GAL4&gt;&gt;UAS-Aβ42 (elav; Aβ42) cultures were treated with curare (20 μM) from 4 to 6 DIV to inhibit the increase in cholinergic activity induced by Aβ42. sEPSCs recorded at 9 DIV showed that curare-treated neurons did not exhibit the synaptic silencing induced in mock-treated elav;Aβ42 neurons (mock treated, 2,617.98 ± 394.46 ms, n = 8 cells; Aβ42-treated, 230.28 ± 5.00 ms, n = 9 cells).

(D) Aβ42 peptide at 2.5 nM, which was shown in Figure 6B to exhibit an increase in spontaneous activity (decreased inter-event times), was applied to Ctrl and Dα7PΔEY6 (Dα7−/−) mutant neurons at for 30–60 min at 4 DIV. sEPSCs were then recorded at 9 DIV. Aβ42 peptide application at 4 DIV induced significant synaptic depression at 9 DIV in wild-type neurons, with greatly enhanced inter-event times (mock exposure, 830.84 ± 48.96 ms, n = 13 cells; Aβ42-exposure, 2,832.99 ± 300.78 ms, n = 8 cells), but not in Dα7PΔEY6 mutant neurons (mock-exposure, 886.64 ± 51.41 ms, n = 8 cells; Aβ42-exposure, 703.29 ± 35.44 ms, n = 8 cells). Scale bar, 50 ms /5 pA.
