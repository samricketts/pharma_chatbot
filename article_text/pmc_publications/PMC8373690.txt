Importance:

Advance care planning (ACP), in which patients or their surrogates discuss goals and preferences for care with physicians, attorneys, friends and family, is an important approach to help align goals with actual treatment. ACP may be particularly valuable in patients with advanced serious illnesses such as Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) for whom surgery carries significant risks.

Objective:

To determine the frequency, timing, and factors associated with ACP billing in Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD undergoing non-trauma inpatient surgery.

Design:

This national cohort study analyses Medicare fee-for-service claims data from 2016-2017. All patients had a six-month lookback and follow-up period.

Setting:

National Medicare fee-for-service data

Participants:

All patients with ADRD, defined according to the Chronic Conditions Warehouse, undergoing inpatient surgery from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017.

Exposures:

Patient demographics, medical history, and procedural outcomes

Main Outcome:

ACP billing codes from six months before to six months after admission for inpatient surgery

Results:

This study included 299,957 patients with ADRD undergoing surgery. 21,754 (7.5%) had billed ACP within the 6-months before and after surgical admission. In a multivariable analysis, patients of white race, male sex, and residence in the Southern and Midwestern US were at the highest risk of not receiving ACP. Of all patients who received ACP, 5,960 (27.4%) did so before surgery while 12,658 (52.8%) received ACP after surgery. Timing of ACP after surgery was associated with an Elixhauser comorbidity index of three or higher (1.23, p=0.045) and major postoperative complication or death (OR 1.52, p&lt;0.0001).

Conclusions and Relevance:

Overall ACP billing code use is low among Medicare patients with ADRD undergoing surgery. Billed ACP appears to have a reactive pattern, occurring most commonly after surgery and in association with postoperative mortality and complications. Additional study is warranted to understand barriers to use.


Introduction

The alignment of care with patient preferences is central to healthcare. Such alignment is an ethical obligation for physicians, carries value for patients and their families who have interests in obtaining wanted treatment and avoiding unwanted treatment, and optimizes resource utilization. These issues are brought into high relief by surgery both because of the risk of complications and death and also because it can act as an inflection point in function and independence for patients. Advance care planning (ACP) – discussions between patients or their surrogates and physicians, other health care providers, attorneys, friends, and family to clarify patient goals and values to guide decision-making – is one approach to help facilitate this alignment. Engaging in ACP is associated with greater decisional satisfaction, reduced use of invasive measures at the end of life, and other benefits1,2.

Beginning January 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) began to reimburse clinicians to have ACP discussions with their patients and surrogates. Analyses of ACP using Medicare claims data are predicated on the treatment of ACP billing codes as substitutes for ACP itself. The authors acknowledge at the outset that the use of billing codes is an imperfect tool for gauging ACP occurrence. ACP may occur either outside of the clinician-patient relationship, or within it but not be captured by billing. Indeed, our own unpublished qualitative work has demonstrated that much ACP occurs in clinical settings without being billed3. Despite these limitations, because Medicare claims represent a standardized measure of ACP services in a very large and rich national dataset, it offers an advantage over previous studies that may have relied on small samples or non-standardized measures of ACP.

ACP may be particularly useful for patients with advanced serious illnesses, such as Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs), because of the higher impact of any healthcare decision. There is evidence, for example, to suggest worse outcomes after some surgeries in patients with ADRD4,5. Patterns of ACP implementation are incompletely understood, with implications for ADRD largely unexplored. Similarly, data on the timing of ACP relative to surgery are absent. On this basis, we sought to examine the frequency, timing, and clinical factors associated with ACP billing code use in fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD undergoing inpatient surgery.

Methods

Data sources and study population

This study was approved by the Mass General Brigham institutional review board; individual patient consent was waived. We examined a national sample of Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD at least 66 years old with continuous fee-for-service coverage from January 1, 2016 to death or December 31, 2017. Inpatient, outpatient, and carrier files were obtained for analysis. ADRD was defined using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes contained within the Chronic Conditions Warehouse definition of ADRD6. Inclusion in the analysis required at least one code in at least one inpatient, subacute nursing facility, home health agency, hospital outpatient, or carrier claim in the three years preceding analysis. Diagnosis related groups were used to identify all patients undergoing inpatient surgery from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 to allow for a 6-month lookback and follow-up period of all patients. Urgent, emergent, and elective surgeries were included and trauma was excluded. Only the first surgery within our study period was used for analysis. Each patient had an individualized observation window spanning 6 months prior to the date of surgical admission through 6 months after the date of surgical discharge.

Variables

ACP was identified using current procedural terminology codes 99497 and add-on code 99498. Only the first ACP code within each patient’s individualized observation window was used for analysis.

A list of major surgical complications was generated from an examination of existing lists with expert review7,8 (Supplementary Material S1).

Statistical Analysis

We performed two primary analyses: 1) to assess factors associated with the presence of ACP in the entire study population and 2) to assess factors associated with the timing of ACP among patients who had at least one ACP. We used univariate and multiple logistic regression models for both.

Results

We identified 2,124,989 unique Medicare beneficiaries who underwent surgery from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. Of these, 299,957 (14.1%) qualified as having an ADRD diagnosis. After exclusion of beneficiaries without continuous fee-for-service coverage and those younger than age 66 years, there remained 289,428 eligible patients. The mean age of the overall cohort was 81.9 years and 40.5% were male. 86.5% were white and 8.4% were black (Table 1). The cohort came principally from the South (43.3%) and Midwest (22.3%).

69.9% had an Elixhauser comorbidity score of 3 or higher, while only 12.9% had a score of 1 or less. Hypertension (74.8%), diabetes (31.6%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (22.8%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fewer than 3% had no indicated comorbidities aside from ADRD. Mortality was 24.1% within our study period.

21,754 (7.5%) of the overall cohort had ACP within our overall study period (Figure/Table 1). Of all ACP events, only 27.4% occurred prior to surgical admission. 14.4% occurred during surgical admission and 58.2% occurred after surgical admission. 81.7% of patients had a single ACP, 13.4% had two ACP events, while 4.9% had three or more ACP events within our study period. Of patients who experienced a major postoperative complication including death, 8.5% had ACP billing codes. Of these, 59.1% were after their surgical admission, while 25.2% were before.

After multivariable adjustment, female sex (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), patient age (1.01, 95% CI 1.01-1.01), and non-white race (for black OR 1.13, for other race OR 1.09), and an Elixhauser comorbidity index of at least 3 (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.19-1.44) were associated with an increased likelihood of any billed ACP encounter (Table 2). Relative to the Northeast, the South, Midwest, and Puerto Rico/US Virgin Islands were associated with reduced likelihood of receiving ACP. Most importantly, any complication, including death, within 6 months of surgical discharge was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving ACP (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.51-1.61). As a sensitivity analysis we repeated our analysis for only elective surgery. No variables changed significance and none of the changes in magnitudes of the odds ratios were clinically meaningful.

To examine factors associated with timing of ACP, we performed an analysis of only patients who received ACP. We found several factors associated with receipt of ACP after admission for surgery: older patient age (OR 1.004, 95% CI, 1.000-1.008) and an Elixhauser comorbidity index of at least 3 (OR 1.23, 95% CI, 1.00-1.50) (Supplementary Table S1). Major surgical complications, including death, within 6 months of discharge had the highest adjusted association with ACP after admission: OR 1.52 (95% CI, 1.41-4.63). Non-white, non-black race was associated with a decreased likelihood, OR 0.86 (95% CI, 0.76-0.98).

Discussion

Despite the fact that patients with ADRD undergoing surgery are an intrinsically high-risk population ideally suited for ACP, our data show that ACP billing code use is low. Previous studies confirm these low use rates, some showing less than 1% among Medicare beneficiaries9,10. A recent study from our group found an overall use of 6.3% among Medicare beneficiaries in 201711. Despite the marginally higher overall ACP rate of 7.5% in our current study, the overall use is still low given the vulnerable ADRD population that we examined.

White race, male sex, and residence within the South and Midwest were demographic features associated with the highest risk for failing to receive billed ACP. These data examining ACP in a national population of surgical patients with ADRD are novel, and reasons for these findings are unclear and will require additional study.

Our data also suggest that ACP is used largely reactively. Despite the potential value of ACP as a tool to help guide major healthcare decisions, only 27.4% occurred before surgical admission and 58.2% occurred afterwards. This reactive nature of ACP use is confirmed by the strong association between postoperative complications/death and both ACP overall and timing of ACP after surgery in separate adjusted analyses. In other words, patients who had complications, including mortality, were most likely to receive ACP, but these were most likely to occur after surgery rather than before.

Surgical decision-making for patients with ADRD may be both more difficult and more consequential than for those without ADRD. The difficulty may stem from the challenges patients face in articulating their own preferences, the presence of surrogates, and conflict between surrogates. These challenges may complicate the alignment of surgical decisions with patient goals. The consequences of decision-making may be more dramatic in that the risk for poor outcomes after surgery is higher compared to patients without ADRD. For example, the authors found that patients with ADRD had worse traditional (e.g. 90-day postoperative mortality) and patient-centered outcomes (e.g. risk of prolonged subacute nursing facility admissions) after inpatient vascular surgery compared to patients without ADRD4.

Our novel finding that ACP occurred most frequently after surgery is important for several reasons. First, ACP is a tool to align patient goals and healthcare. In patients with ADRD especially, who may have difficulty articulating preferences with disease progression, ACP is also a means of preserving patient autonomy. Second, ACP potentially improves resource utilization – for example, reduced intensity of care at the end of life11. All of these benefits, however, may be weakened by the timing of ACP after major surgery rather than before. This is because surgery itself is a resource-intensive event that may not have been consistent with patient goals and may itself further impair the articulation of these goals by patients. These data suggest that the effects of ACP should be considered in the context of ACP timing.

Given the established benefits of ACP it is clear that there is substantial room for improvement in both frequency and timing of conversations1,2. Although introduction of ACP billing codes and compensation was a tangible and helpful step, there are still formidable cultural and systems level barriers to use, which remain to be identified and overcome.

Our study has several limitations. First, as noted above, ACP may occur without corresponding billing and would not have been included in our study. Our group has an ongoing qualitative study addressing the factors underlying this phenomenon, and preliminary findings suggest a large proportion of ACP conversations are not captured with the billing codes. Additionally, our study period includes the period when ACP billing codes were first introduced, which would be expected to have initially low but growing rate of uptake. Nevertheless, we expect that the broad conclusions of our study remain valid. Specifically, that ACP is infrequently used, that certain subpopulations are at especially high risk for not receiving it, and that ACP is used principally reactively. Second, ADRD may not be completely captured in Medicare claims data. Multiple validation studies examining ICD-9 and -10 codes for ADRD have found high positive and negative predictive values and specificity12–15. Sensitivity, however, has been variable and lower. It is likely that our data may have missed mild cases of dementia. Third, although ACP is intended to increase goal-concordant care, our data does not evaluate this outcome. Our data also does not examine organizational and provider factors related to ACP. Such an analysis may provide important insights into the existing pattern of ACP that we demonstrated and provide clues to potential interventions. Our analysis of death included complications. We acknowledge that this inclusion may create bias given that ACP may impact timing of death and that likely death may impact timing of ACP. Last, given that our study was restricted to Medicare beneficiaries above 66 years, extrapolation to younger and non-Medicare patients should be done with caution.

Conclusions

ACP codes among Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD undergoing surgery are infrequently used. Certain subpopulations – white race, male sex, and residence in the Southern and Midwestern US – are at even higher risk for not receiving billed ACP. Billed ACP is usually used reactively with the majority occurring after surgery and occurrence is strongly associated with a major postoperative complication or death. Given the established benefits of ACP, additional study is warranted to understand and overcome barriers to use.

Key Points

In this national cohort study of 299,957 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with dementia undergoing surgery, only 7.5% had billing codes for advance care planning.

Only 27.4% of billed ACP occurred before surgery and was associated with non-white race, female sex, and postoperative complications and mortality.

Why does this paper matter?

Billed ACP occurs infrequently in this population of older patients with dementia undergoing surgery. Furthermore it is used reactively, occurring principally after surgery and in association with major postoperative complications. Reasons underlying these findings are unclear and warrant additional study.
