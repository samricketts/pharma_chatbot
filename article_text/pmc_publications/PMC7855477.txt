Objective:

Subtle deficits in several cognitive domains characterize the neuropsychological profile of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Assessment of preclinical individuals with genes causing autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a model for prodromal disease. We sought to sensitively evaluate attention and working memory using a computerized battery in non-demented persons carrying ADAD mutations.

Method:

A total of 71 non-demented Latinos at-risk for ADAD mutations were recruited [40 mutation carriers (MCs), 31 non-mutation carriers (NCs)] and completed a Spanish language chronometric battery of speeded decision and working memory tasks.

Results:

On two complex reaction time (RT) tasks involving decision-making and response inhibition, MCs exhibited slower RTs than NCs as they approached their anticipated age of dementia diagnosis. Education moderated these effects, but only in younger MCs. APOE ε4 status was not associated with age-related slowing among NCs or MCs on any of the tests.

Conclusions:

Our findings indicate MCs respond more slowly as they approach the age of dementia onset on tasks with greater demands on executive function. Our results also suggest these effects were not explained by APOE ε4 status independently of ADAD mutation status. Computerized reaction time tests can provide sensitive measures of the earliest cognitive changes in AD.

1.1 Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of Aβ derivatives of amyloid precursor protein in the form of extracellular plaques in limbic structures and in cerebral cortex (Bondi et al., 2009; Braak &amp; Braak, 1991; Vinters, 2015). Possibly as a result, and more directly related to cognitive deficits, are intracellular cytoskeletal abnormalities in the form of neurofibrillary tangles as well as neuronal and synaptic loss (Nelson et al., 2012). As more individuals survive into older age, a growing amount of research is targeting the earliest stages of behavioral and cognitive changes associated with the disease, when clinical interventions may be most effective (Thal, 1999; Vellas et al., 2013).

The clinical manifestations of AD are consistent with the disease’s neuropathology. Deficits in episodic memory are the most common and consistent cognitive difficulties to occur in early AD (Cullum et al., 1995; Greene et al., 1996). Although AD ultimately affects all areas of cognition, tandem deficits in semantic memory, abstract reasoning, executive function, attention, and visuospatial abilities have also been identified early in the disease (Butters et al., 1995; Castel et al., 2007; Salmon &amp; Bondi, 2009). Given that the neurodegenerative changes associated with AD begin long before clinical manifestations (Bateman et al., 2012; Bondi et al., 2009; Sperling et al., 2011), the identification of subtle cognitive changes occurring during this “prodromal” phase of the disease have become a focus for early detection and as potential markers of efficacy for intervention and prevention trials (Vellas et al., 2013). These changes have been detected 5 to 10 years prior to diagnosis of AD and have been used to help predict the development of the disease (Bateman et al., 2012; Ringman et al., 2005; Smith &amp; Bondi, 2008; Wilson et al., 2012). Besides subtle deficits in learning and memory, researchers have demonstrated that deficits in attention, processing speed, response inhibition, and other aspects of executive function may further characterize the neuropsychological profile seen in preclinical AD (Twamley et al., 2006).

There is convergent evidence that the ability to perform tasks of divided attention (Baddeley et al., 2001; Perry &amp; Hodges, 1999) and to suppress a prepotent response (Harrington et al., 2013) is diminished in early AD. Though this also appears to occur in the course of normal aging, most published studies show an enhancement of this deficit in AD (Castel et al., 2007; Collette et al., 2009; Hutchison et al., 2010). Furthermore, increased intra-individual reaction time variability in response inhibition or reversal tasks has been reported in late-onset AD (LOAD; (Christ et al., 2018; Duchek et al., 2009). As numerous conditions associated with aging other than AD can produce and compound cognitive difficulties, it can be challenging to differentiate the effects of AD pathology from other co-morbidities of aging. The assessment of relatively young and otherwise healthy individuals with fully penetrant autosomal dominant genes for young onset Alzheimer’s disease (ADAD) can provide a model of “pure” prodromal AD. Mutations in the genes coding for amyloid precursor protein (APP; Goate et al., 1991) and the presenilin-1 and −2 proteins (PSEN1 and PSEN2; (O’Hara et al., 1998; Schellenberg et al., 1992) are associated with the development of ADAD such that the presence of a mutation determines that the individual will develop the disease with essentially complete certainty. Additionally, given that the age of onset tends to be consistent within and between families with the same mutation (Murrell et al., 2006; Ryman et al., 2014), it is possible to estimate when mutation carriers will develop the disease.

In this study, our objective was to evaluate cognitive skills beyond episodic memory using computerized tasks in persons with these genetic alterations before clinical presentation of overt cognitive decline. We have previously shown that, in addition to episodic memory, executive function deficits as indicated by slowed performance on the Trails B test occur in preclinical ADAD (Ringman et al., 2005; Ringman et al., 2009). However, there is evidence that measures of intra-individual reaction time variability (IIV) may be superior predictors of neurocognitive impairment compared to simple processing speed measures in LOAD (Tales et al., 2012). In the current study we sought to examine attention and response reversal performance in IIV reaction time paradigms in prodromal ADAD. We hypothesized that preclinical ADAD mutation carriers would demonstrate worse performance than their non-mutation carrying kin.

2.1 Materials and Methods

2.1.1 Participants

Participants were non-demented persons of Latino origin known to be at 50% risk for inheriting pathogenic PSEN1 or APP mutations. This risk was by virtue of being the first-degree relatives of persons known to be affected in a family in whom such a mutation had been identified. Index patients were identified through clinical evaluations or through referral for research at the University of Southern California (USC), the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) or at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City (INNN). All participants underwent cognitive testing on the same laptop computer either at the INNN, at UCLA, in a private neurology clinic in Mexicali, Mexico, or in their homes. Complete data from 71 participants were available for four subtests.

Each participant’s age in relation to their estimated age of dementia onset was calculated. The age of onset of symptoms is fairly consistent within a family and mutation but more variable between families (Ryman et al., 2014). Therefore, an individual’s “adjusted age” can be calculated that estimates how many years from dementia diagnosis a given participant is based off the family’s mean age of onset (Ryman et al., 2014). For each family, a family-specific age of dementia diagnosis was calculated as the median age of dementia diagnosis for all affected persons in a family for whom this age was known. Each subject’s adjusted age is a function of this age minus the individual’s chronological age, such that negative adjusted ages indicate years younger than the individual’s expected age of dementia diagnosis.

The population represented 16 different families of whom 12 carried the A431E mutation in PSEN1, 1 the L235V mutation in PSEN1, 1 the G206A mutation in PSEN1, and 2 the V717I mutation in APP. Among the 12 families that carried the A431E PSEN1 mutation, the mean of the family-specific median age of dementia diagnosis varied from 37 to 47 years (Mean = 42.8±0.3). Among the total of 71 participants, 40 (56%) were ADAD mutation carriers (MCs) and 31 (44%) were non-carriers (NCs). The median age of dementia diagnosis for the families of origin of the participants ranged from 37 to 54 (Mean = 45.0±4.9) and adjusted ages ranged from −35 to 18 (Mean= −13.9±1.3) for the whole sample. Notably, the adjusted age range for MCs was more restricted (−35 to −1), given that MCs typically present with a clinically diagnosable dementia syndrome at the family’s median age of dementia diagnosis (i.e., when adjusted age = 0). MCs and NCs were comparable with regards to age, adjusted age, education level, gender, MMSE score, number of APOE ε4 alleles, mood, and health history (Table 1). Among MCs, 36 had PSEN1 mutations [29 with the A431E (Murrell et al., 2006; Yescas et al., 2006) and 7 with the L235V mutation (Janssen et al., 2003)] and 4 had the V717I APP mutation (Goate et al., 1991). In the MC group, only 2 individuals (5%) had MMSE scores below a cutoff of 24 (Anthony et al., 1982), suggesting mild cognitive dysfunction. There were no scores below the suggested cutoff for severe impairment (&lt;18; Black et al., 1999). None of the MMSE scores in the NC group fell below cutoffs suggestive of impairment.

All participants signed informed consent approved by Institutional Review Boards at either UCLA or the National Institute for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Mexico City or both.

2.1.2 Procedures

The Cognometer® (Cognitive Care, Inc., Newport Beach, CA, USA) is a chronometric computer program that has been validated in the examination of cognitive processing in adults (Bragin et al., 2005; Nathan et al., 2004; O’Hara et al., 2008; Polich &amp; Gloria, 2001) and has versions available in multiple languages. All 71 participants were administered 4 tests on the same laptop computer in Spanish. Practice trials were administered for each subtest:

1) Test 1, or Simple Reaction Time:

After a random delay of 500–1500 milliseconds (ms), a crosshair target appeared in the center of the screen. The participants responded by pressing the down-arrow key as fast as they could with their dominant hand after the target appeared. The stimulus remained visible for 750 ms, or until the participant responded.

2) Test 2, or Choice Reaction Time:

In this task participants were presented with two concentric squares. Subsequently, one of the sides on the outer square would become illuminated and participants were to press either the “up” (top), “down” (bottom), “left” or “right” arrow keys depending on which side of the square became illuminated. On a subset of trials, the inner circle would also become illuminated and when this occurred, participants were to press an additional marked key and hold it while pressing the appropriate arrow key.

3) Test 3, or Semantic Decision/Response Reversal (SD/RR) Test:

After a random delay of 1000–1200 ms, participants were presented with a word and a picture. If the word correctly described the picture (e.g. a picture of a chair and the Spanish word for chair), the participants were to press the right arrow key to indicate ‘‘yes.’’ If the word did not describe the picture, the participants were to press the left arrow key to indicate ‘‘no’’ (semantic decision, or “SD”). On a subset of trials, a reversal cue was also presented (a tone or the word, ‘‘REVERSE’’), in which case the participant was to reverse her or his answer and press the left arrow key for ‘‘yes’’ and the right arrow key for ‘‘no’’ (response reversal trials, or “RR”). The word and picture remained visible until the participant responded.

4) Test 4, or Serial Memory:

In this test of working memory, a series of individual shapes, objects, and portraits of people appeared on the screen. Participants were instructed to press the left arrow key (labeled “no”) if the picture had not appeared before in the series and the right arrow key (labeled “yes”) if the picture had been previously presented in the series.

For all tests, participants were instructed to respond as quickly as they could while maintaining accuracy. Participants’ performances were assessed in terms of: (1) mean reaction time (RT) in milliseconds (ms) of all trials (correct and incorrect); (2) error rate (the percentage of error trials relative to total trials); and (3) RT variability (SD of RT in msecs).

2.1.3 Genetic Testing

Participants underwent testing for the mutation for which they were known to be at-risk using either restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses or direct sequencing. Participants also underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping using standard techniques. While participants were not made aware of their genetic testing results, they were given the option of undergoing clinical genetic counseling and testing outside of the study. All but one individual were unaware of their genetic status at the time of the study.

2.1.4 Statistical Analyses

Reaction time data were checked for normality and outliers. Non-normal distributions were log-transformed, and outliers removed from subsequent analyses. Sample characteristics and demographics were compared using t-tests for continuous variables [e.g., age, MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) score] and with chi-square tests for categorical variables (e.g., sex, presence of the APOE ε4 allele). Multiple linear regression models were used to examine the effect of mutation status controlling for adjusted age and education on the mean reaction times for each of the four tests in the overall sample. In order to further examine within-group effects, similar multiple linear regression analyses were performed separately for mutation carriers (MCs) and non-carriers (NCs), testing for the effects of adjusted age and education. Next, using linear regression we tested for possible quadratic (i.e., curvilinear) relations between adjusted age and reaction time as well as errors. The purpose of this analysis was to further examine changes in reaction time and error rates as mutation carriers approached their expected age of dementia diagnosis (Ringman et al., 2005).

3.1 Results

Reaction time data for each of the four computerized tasks were not normally distributed and, therefore, were log-transformed. Outlier analyses using boxplot procedures showed 3 extreme values for Simple Reaction Time, 2 for Choice Reaction Time, 3 for Semantic Decision/Response Reversal, and 2 for Serial Memory. These were subsequently excluded from their relative task analyses.

3.1.1 Correlations

As shown in Table 2, all four of the reaction time tests were correlated with each other (Pearson’s r range 0.236 to 0.712, all ps&lt;0.05). Comparisons with several sample characteristics showed several significant correlations. Simple Reaction Time was not correlated with any of the characteristics (all ps&gt;0.05). Choice Reaction Time was correlated with adjusted age (p&lt;0.001), education (p=0.006), and global cognition as measured by the MMSE (p=0.001). The Semantic Decision/Response Reversal task was similarly associated with adjusted age (p=0.004), education (p=0.035), and MMSE (p&lt;0.001). The Serial Memory task was associated with adjusted age (p=0.017), gender (p=0.038), and MMSE (p=0.034). Notably, neither APOE ε4 status nor depressed mood (as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory) was correlated with any of the four tests (all ps&gt;0.05).

3.1.2 Group Comparisons

NCs and MCs did not differ on any of the demographic or clinical variables tested (Table 1). Group comparisons with t-tests demonstrated no significant differences between MCs and NCs on mean reaction times for any of the four tasks (Table 3). Moreover, error rates and variability were similar between the two groups. Linear regression models also did not reveal a main effect of mutation status on reaction time after controlling for age and education on any of the four tasks (all ps&gt;0.05; Table 4).

3.1.3 Reaction Time and Age

Linear regression models in the overall sample revealed an effect of adjusted age on all four tasks: Simple Reaction Time (F1,66=8.119, p=0.006, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.003, R2=0.110), Choice Reaction Time (F1,67=21.766, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.008, R2=0.245), Semantic Decision/Response Reversal (F1,66=5.154, p=0.026, 95% CI: 0.0004, 0.0064, R2=0.072), and Serial Memory (F1,67=4.655, p=0.035, 95% CI: 0.0001, 0.0038, R2=0.065). These effects remained after controlling for education and mutation status (see Table 4).

In order to examine non-linear trends in reaction time as mutation carriers approached their expected age of dementia diagnosis, we used within-group (i.e., NCs, MCs) independent linear regression models that compared models with and without inclusion of a quadratic term for adjusted age. These analyses revealed significant linear and nonlinear relationships between adjusted age and reaction times, especially on more complex tasks; a significant contribution of the quadratic term in MCs was found for both the Choice Reaction Time (Δadjusted R2=0.148, p=0.004) and the Semantic Decision/Response Reversal tasks (Δadjusted R2=0.261, p=0.001), suggesting a significant slowing of reaction times on these two tasks as MCs approached their expected age of dementia diagnosis (see Table 5). Consistent with the F-tests, the largest reductions in bias-corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) were observed in mutation carriers for the Choice Reaction Time task (linear AICc=−170.047, quadratic AICc=−177.16, Δi=7.069) and the Semantic Decision/Response Reversal task (linear AICc=−146.022, quadratic AICc=−156.764, Δi=10.742). These results suggest the model including the quadratic term is nearly 30 times more likely to be correct than the linear model for the Choice Reaction Time task; in the case of the Semantic Decision/Response Reversal task, the quadratic model is over 180 times more like to be correct than the linear model (Burnham et al., 2011). In NCs, a significant linear relationship with adjusted age was found only for Choice Reaction Time, such that NCs showed slowed reaction time with increasing age, with no significant quadratic relationship; no other relationships (linear or quadratic) were found for the remaining three tasks.

3.1.4 Reaction Time, Age, and Education

Linear regression models in the overall sample revealed an effect of education for only two of the four tasks: Choice Reaction Time (F1,67=6.912, p=0.011, 95% CI: −0.020, −0.003, R2=0.094) and Semantic Decision/Response Reversal (F1,66=5.778, p=0.019, 95% CI: −0.023, −0.002, R2=0.080). These effects remained after controlling for age and mutation status (see Table 4).

In within-group linear regression models, the effect of education after controlling for age was observed on Choice Reaction Time in MCs (t36=−4.309, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI: −0.035, −0.012, partial r2=0.340), but not in NCs (t27=−1.262, p=0.218, 95% CI: −0.015, 0.004, partial r2=0.056). Similarly, for Semantic Decision/Response Reversal, education was still associated with reaction time after controlling for age in MCs (t34=−2.560, p=0.015, 95% CI: −0.035, −0.004, partial r2=0.162), but not in NCs (t28=−1.168, p=0.252, 95% CI: −0.022, 0.006, partial r2=0.047). For illustrative purposes only given the small sample, we performed a median split of education and plotted the performance-by-age relationships on these two tasks for each group (Figure 1). Younger MCs with a high school education or higher (n=21) were generally faster on the Choice Reaction Time task than MCs without a high school degree (n=17); however, this protective effect of education was attenuated as MCs approached their expected age of diagnosis. In NCs, those without a high school education (n=12) demonstrated a flat slope across age relative to NCs with a high school education or higher (n=19). A similar pattern was observed on the Semantic Decision/Response Reversal task. In Figure 2, group-level effects of adjusted age are shown for each of the four tasks after controlling for education.

With the purpose of further examining these age- and education-related findings in the context of error rates, a percent efficiency score was calculated for both the Choice Reaction Time task and the Semantic Decision/Response Reversal task. Percent efficiency was calculated as a function of mean reaction time and variability controlling for error rate such that: % efficiency = [100*(Reaction Time – Reaction Time Variability)*Number of Trials]/[Reaction Time*(Number of Trials + Errors)]. This score was not normally distributed; therefore, it was log-transformed and outliers removed. Groups did not differ on percent efficiency for either task. In sample-wide regression analyses, neither adjusted age nor years of education was associated with percent efficiency for either task (all ps&gt;0.05). Within-group regression analyses revealed no significant effects of adjusted age or education on percent efficiency in NCs. In MCs, years of education, but not adjusted age, was associated with percent efficiency on the Choice Reaction Time task (t36=2.324, p=0.026, 95% CI: 0.0004, 0.0063, partial r2=0.134) as well as on the Semantic Decision/Response Reversal task (t36=2.048, p=0.048, 95% CI: 0.00004, 0.00851, partial r2=0.107) such that greater years of education were associated with greater efficiency.

4.1 Discussion

In our cross-sectional study of non-demented persons at 50% risk for inheriting pathogenic mutations causing autosomal dominant AD, we found that MCs performed more slowly than NCs as they approached the family-specific age of dementia diagnosis on both a non-verbal and a verbal two-step task that required a decision and an inhibition of a pre-potent response. In MCs, but not in NCs, education appeared to moderate reaction time on these tasks at younger ages, but this effect was attenuated as MCs approached the age of dementia diagnosis. Overall, MCs made no more errors and demonstrated no more variability than NCs; years of education alone was associated with greater percent efficiency, which accounted for errors and variability, in MCs but not in NCs. Prior work has demonstrated a similar slowing of reaction times on multiple tasks on the Cognometer® in community-dwelling carriers of the APOE ε4 genotype with a mean age of 75, suggesting potential sensitivity for identifying preclinical AD (O’Hara et al., 1998). Notably, we did not find an effect of the APOE ε4 allele on reaction time in our sample. Our results observed in persons with autosomal dominant AD mutations of young onset reflects the more powerful effect of such mutations relative to that of the APOE ε4 allele.

A prior study found that reaction time on simple, choice, or choice reaction time tests with distraction did not enhance dementia diagnosis beyond that provided by standard neuropsychological testing (Storandt &amp; Beaudreau, 2004). However, the distraction paradigm used in that study consisted of hearing a recording of a weather report in the background and therefore did not require a redirection of attention. When executive function has been more specifically probed, more substantial effects in early AD have been revealed. Slowing of performance on the Trails B task, a task requiring shifting between ascending numbers and letters, has long been known to be a sensitive indicator in early AD (Chen et al., 2000) and indeed we found it to be affected in preclinical ADAD in a population partially overlapping with the current study population (Ringman et al., 2005). Using the Simon task, Castel et al. (Castel et al., 2007) found that persons with very mild AD were slower and made more errors on trials when the stimulus direction was incongruent with the response direction. More recently, another study showed that error rate in response inhibition on the Stroop task was increased in very mild AD (Hutchison et al., 2010) and in AD biomarker positive asymptomatic individuals (Harrington et al., 2013). More closely in line with the measures used in the present study, Christ and colleagues (Christ et al., 2018) demonstrated superior sensitivity of IIV RT and accuracy-based IIV measures, compared to other non-IIV measures, in detecting underlying neuropathology in LOAD. While we did not find evidence for group differences in IIV RT, our findings of slowed reaction times, which were most evident in two-step tasks requiring reversal of a pre-potent response in ADAD MCs as they approach their age of dementia diagnosis, are consistent with these prior findings. Although IIV RT was did not significantly differ between groups, ranges in IIV RT values were qualitatively larger in MCs compared to NCs.

Our results indicate that non-mutation carrying controls perform more slowly when they must engage their working memory abilities compared to when they must only make simple decisions quickly. Similarly, mutation carriers exhibit this pattern of slowed performance during more challenging tasks. However, mutation carriers also exhibit a distinct pattern of reduced speed as they approach their expected age of dementia diagnosis at a rate greater than non-carriers. In addition, these individuals showed this pattern of slowing on more complex tasks requiring use of higher-order abilities, indicating that they have difficulty with consistently sustaining their attention when they must maintain information “on-line” while mentally manipulating that information. This finding is consistent with past research demonstrating that deficits in attention are seen in preclinical AD (Hutchison et al., 2010; Twamley et al., 2006).

The current study is not without limitations. Importantly, the neuropsychological battery employed over the duration of the data collection for the current study changed and therefore we do not have consistent measures against which to compare the sensitivity and specificity of our computerized testing for evaluating cognitive decline in preclinical ADAD. The small sample size limited our ability to directly test interactions and may have reduced our ability to detect group differences. Moreover, many subjects in our study were more than 15 years younger than the age of dementia onset in their family and therefore would not have been expected to manifest even subtle cognitive changes, again limiting our power to detect such changes. Lastly, although depressed mood was not associated with task performance, we cannot rule out the possible role of other mood factors (e.g. anxiety regarding their at-risk status) in task performance. However, all but one of our subjects were unaware of mutation carrier status, suggesting that if an effect of mood on performance was present, it would likely be due to direct effects of the mutation itself rather than being related to the individuals’ awareness of genetic status.

Despite the limited power to detect subtle changes, our results indicate small, but notable mutation-related differences in young adults long before disease onset. The nature and pattern of results in the current study suggest a reduction in performance that can be more closely linked to AD pathology compared to similar results in sporadic AD, results of which may be affected by other age-related factors. Our results also suggest a buffering effect of education in younger individuals with autosomal dominant AD mutations. In sporadic AD, the lack of sensitivity to early disease stages has been identified as a limitation of clinically available cognitive assessment measures, which typically use a traditional pen-and-paper format. For this reason, several efforts are being made to develop new tools or improve the sensitivity of existing tools. An example of the latter – the digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) – has shown effects of aging on time to completion and decision making latencies (Piers et al., 2017) that can be used as additional cognitive markers to differentiate amnestic mild cognitive impairment and mild AD from healthy aging (Müller et al., 2019). While our data do not suggest reaction time measures like the ones used in the current study should replace other assessment tools or be used alone, the current results add to a growing body of literature demonstrating the addition of such measures can enhance our diagnostic processes. Moreover, our findings are consistent with extant literature on the predictive nature of reduced processing speed (O’Hara et al., 2008) and speeded executive function measures (Chapman et al., 2010, 2011) in the progression to AD. When executive skills are engaged, there are group differences in speed, but not in accuracy. This highlights the utility of these tests in detecting changes that standard neuropsychological tests may not detect, as most rely on total accuracy rather than subtle changes in reaction time. Similarly, our findings suggest that reaction time, sustained attention, and executive skills should be targeted in cognitive assessments early in the course of AD.

Highlights:

This study examines cognitive abilities in preclinical autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (AD), allowing us to evaluate the earliest symptoms in this disease.

Our results suggest reaction time for complex tasks are associated with the earliest symptoms in AD.

These findings significantly add to the growing body of literature suggesting cognitive performance mediated by frontal lobe functioning should be targeted in cognitive assessments of early AD.
