Objective:

Given the association between essential tremor (ET) and higher rates of cognitive decline, assessing this decline is an important element of research and clinical care. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are two broad, brief measures that are widely used to monitor cognitive impairment in various neurological disorders. We sought to determine the relative ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline in elderly patients with ET.

Methods:

We administered a neuropsychological battery to an ET cohort every 18 months over 4.5 years. We defined the gold standard for change in cognition as the change in neuropsychological test scores over consecutive evaluations and applied the Reliable Change Method to detect meaningful increases/decreases in test scores. We performed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to quantify the area under the curve (AUC) and compare the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline.

Results:

The AUCs for the MoCA and the MMSE did not differ significantly at any interval nor when all intervals were pooled for analysis. Across all intervals, the abilities of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline were consistently poor.

Conclusions:

We found that the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline in ET patients over 18-month intervals is inadequate. Unchanged scores on the MoCA and the MMSE in ET over time should be approached with caution. We propose that these screening tools should be supplemented with additional neuropsychological tests.

pmcIntroduction

Essential tremor (ET) is a highly prevalent neurological disease with a worldwide prevalence of &gt;5.7% in adults aged 65 and older, thereby making it one of the most common neurological diseases.1 Historically conceptualized as kinetic tremor in the upper extremities without other neurological features, ET used to be regarded as monosymptomatic and benign.2 This conceptualization of ET has evolved over recent years as research has shifted focus to the existence of additional motor and nonmotor features.3–5 In fact, ET is not solely a motor disease. Numerous studies have found that ET is associated with cognitive dysfunction, particularly in tasks involving executive function, such as phonemic fluency, problem solving, and word list recall.6–8

The features of this cognitive dysfunction support the growing understanding that ET is a disorder of cerebellar dysregulation.5 Indeed, previous neuroimaging and behavioral studies have found that the cerebellum is involved in both cognitive and emotional processing,9–11 resulting in a “cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome” characterized in large part by executive dysfunction.12–17 More recently, the cognitive profile in ET has been shown to be similar to that of neurodegenerative diseases that affect subcortical white matter and basal ganglia structures,18–23 all of which are characterized primarily by executive dysfunction. However, there is growing evidence that ET can also be characterized by an amnestic deficit similar to what is seen in the context of hippocampal compromise (i.e., difficulty storing information into long-term memory).24 Thus, the notion that ET is primarily a dysexecutive syndrome may be an oversimplification. Indeed, it is increasingly clear that ET places individuals at risk for other neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, and that both cortical and subcortical regions outside of the cerebellum are involved.24

This cognitive dysfunction in ET is clinically relevant. Poorer cognitive performance has been linked to greater functional deficit, evident in lower Katz Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Lawton Instrumental (I) ADL scores.25 Moreover, several studies have found a higher prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in ET patients than in controls as well as a greater risk of developing dementia (relative risk = 1.64–1.89).5,7,26–29 To better understand the natural history of this cognitive dysfunction, particularly the decline, it is crucial to track the cognitive status of ET patients over time. A comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation would be an ideal means of tracking cognition over time. However, in the outpatient setting, such monitoring is typically performed via administration of cognitive screening tools, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)30 or the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).31

In comparison to the MMSE, the MoCA is recognized for its broader scope and greater complexity since its tasks cover various cognitive domains and are more demanding, for example the Delayed Recall word list learning/recall task.32 These enhancements may explain the MoCA’s higher sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI and dementia as well as monitoring cognitive change over time.32 Moreover, the MoCA is less susceptible to ceiling effects and thus, demonstrates superior psychometric properties in most clinical settings compared to the MMSE.33,34 Hence, the MoCA has been used to track cognitive changes in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)35 and Parkinson’s Disease (PD).36,37 By comparison, advantages of the MMSE include its shorter administration time and anecdotally, it appears less frustrating for patients with cognitive impairment to complete.31

A prior study compared the ability of the MoCA, the MMSE, and the Scales for Outcomes of Parkinson’s disease-cognition (SCOPA-Cog) to detect cognitive decline in a PD cohort, 44% of which had baseline PD-MCI. The study found that all three tests performed poorly.38 In the ET field, no research has been conducted to compare the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline. Yet, these screening tools are widely used in ET research and clinical settings.5,39,40 Moreover, both involve motor-based assessments,30,31 which may limit the use of these tests for ET patients due to interference from their tremors. Thus, it is even more imperative to determine whether these tests are well suited to monitor cognitive decline in ET patients. To address this gap, we studied a cohort of ET patients who completed recurring neuropsychological testing, including the MoCA and the MMSE, over time. Based on the differing compositions of the two screening tools, our a priori hypothesis was that the MoCA would be superior to the MMSE in detecting changes in global cognition in ET, which would suggest that the MoCA should be prioritized in research and clinical settings focused on tracking cognitive decline in ET patients.

Methods

Cognitive and Neurological Assessments

The Clinical-Pathological Study of Cognitive Impairment in Essential Tremor (COGNET), NINDS R01 NS0876736, is an ongoing, prospective, longitudinal study of cognition in a cohort of patients with chronic ET. In July 2014, the study began enrolling participants who met the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of ET; (2) ≥55 years old; (3) no previous medical history of brain surgery for the treatment of ET; and (4) willingness to enroll as future brain donors in the in the Essential Tremor Centralized Brain Repository.41 Study visits have taken place at 18-month intervals: baseline (T1); 18 months (T2); 36 months (T3); and 54 months (T4). During each in-person study visit, a trained research assistant administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, including the MoCA, the MMSE, and domain-specific neuropsychological assessments. The aim of the battery is to evaluate the performance of participants in the main cognitive domains: attention, language, visuospatial function, memory, and executive function.41 The battery was designed to include tests with little to no reliance on motor functioning so that ET participants with moderate to severe tremors would be minimally disadvantaged.41

For each domain, we selected three cognitive tests for analysis so that for the purposes of this manuscript there were 15 tests total. For the attention domain, Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Color Word Interference Color Naming test,42 Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV (WAIS-IV) Digit Span Backward,43 and Oral Symbol-Digit Modalities Test44 were used. Language was assessed by the 30-item Boston Naming Test,45 D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Fluency test,42 and the Multilingual Aphasia Examination: Token Test.46 Tests of visuospatial function were Benton Judgement of Line Orientation,47 Benton Facial Recognition Test,48 and WAIS IV Visual Puzzles.43 Memory was assessed by California Verbal Learning Test II Long Delay Free Recall test,49 Wechsler Memory Scale Revised: Logical Memory – Delayed,50 and Wechsler Memory Scale IV: Verbal Paired Associates Delayed Recall.51 Lastly, for the executive function domain, D-KEFS Sorting Test – Confirmed Correct Sorts,42 D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Category Switching test,42 and D-KEFS Color Word Interference Inhibition test were used.42

We also conducted an informant interview at every study visit. A close friend or family member would describe the participant’s activities of daily living and any behavioral changes.41 The research team then held a consensus meeting with our expert neuropsychologist (S.C.) and geriatric psychiatrist (E.D.H.) to assign cognitive diagnoses and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores52,53 based on the review of the neuropsychological testing, the informant interview, and the behavioral observations noted by the research assistant.

The three main categories for the cognitive diagnosis were normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia (D).41 Dementia required functional impairment defined as a CDR ≥1 and cognitive impairment (defined as performance &lt;−1.5 standard deviations) on ≥1 test in ≥2 cognitive domains. MCI was defined as a CDR of 0.5 and impairment on at least half of the MCI-designated tests in one domain (single domain MCI) or impairment on at least half of the tests in ≥2 domains (multi-domain MCI). As described in previous literature,41,54 MCI-designated tests were selected a priori based on: (1) relative purity of measurement for the construct under evaluation; (2) demonstrated utility of measures in previous studies; and (3) general availability of the measure to researchers who wish to replicate findings. For example, delayed recall on the CVLT-II list learning test is an MCI-designated test in the memory domain whereas Verbal Paired Associates is not considered an MCI-designated test.

Lastly, to assess tremor and confirm the ET diagnosis, the research team performed a detailed videotaped neurological examination at every study visit.41 The examination was reviewed by a senior movement disorders neurologist (E.D.L.) who rated tremor and confirmed diagnoses using reliable and valid diagnostic criteria for ET.55,56 This cornerstone in the study allows the motor phenotyping of the cohort to be consistent over time.41

Final Sample

The COGNET cohort consists of 234 participants. For this manuscript, we adopted the following inclusion criteria: Participants with (1) a minimum of two in-person evaluations including the MoCA and the MMSE, (2) a neurological diagnosis of ET in every interval, and (3) a cognitive diagnosis of NC or MCI at baseline. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, many T4 evaluations were administered remotely by telephone or using virtual platforms. Since the changes in the administration affected various tests, including the MoCA, we deemed it necessary to restrict the analysis to in-person visits.

In total, 78 participants were ineligible for analysis. These included 33 participants who completed only one cognitive evaluation. Of these 33 participants, 18 died before their second evaluation, 7 discontinued their participation, and 8 were excluded from future follow-up due to a neurological diagnosis upon video examination review (7 dystonia and 1 functional tremor). Thirty-one participants received additional or different diagnoses from ET in one or more study visits (e.g., PD or dystonia). Eleven participants had baseline dementia, which we excluded due to our interest in cognitive decline starting from NC or MCI. Additionally, three participants had a cognitive diagnosis complicated by substance abuse, stroke, or head trauma. As a result, the final sample included 156 out of 234 participants with chronic ET (tremor duration = 38.5 ± 21.4 years).

From T1 to T2, 156 cases were available (Table 1). The following interval, T2 to T3, included 133 cases. Sixty-four cases were analyzed in the final interval, T3 to T4.

Statistical Analysis

We used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26, and data are presented in Tables 1 – 5 and Figure 1. We defined the gold standard for cognitive change as the change observed in neuropsychological test scores over evaluations occurring 18 months apart. Depending on the magnitude and frequency of change in test scores, participants were labeled as changed or unchanged for each 18-month interval, using the Reliable Change Method as outlined by Faust-Socher et al.38 The Reliable Change Index (RCI), which is a metric that aims to estimate the probability that a change in score would arise by chance, is the difference between the change in score for the individual and the change in score for the whole cohort divided by the standard deviation of the change in score for the whole cohort. The RCI was calculated using the following equation: RCI=([X2−X1]−[M2−M1])/SEDwhereX1=individualbaselinescore,X2=theindividualfollow-upscoreM1=normativemeanbaselinesscoreM2=normativemeanfollow-upscoreSED=standarderrorofthedifference,SED=(2*SEM2)½SEM=standarderrorofmeasurement,SEM=SD([1−r]½)SD=pre-testSDr=reliabilitycoefficient

Following Hensel et al, the test-retest reliability of each test was analyzed by computing non-parametric correlation coefficients (Spearman Rho).57

As a deviation from Faust-Socher et al, we defined reliable change as an RCI less than −1.65 or greater than 1.65, meaning that the observed change does not lie within the 90% CI for change. Based on the RCI value, reliable change was deemed present or absent for each completed neuropsychological test at every interval (T1 to T2, T2 to T3, and T3 to T4). If a participant obtained an RCI greater than 1.65 on a minimum of 2 tests, then that participant met the gold standard for global change in cognition and would be classified as “improved.” A participant with an RCI less than −1.65 on a minimum of 2 tests also met the gold standard for global change in cognition, but in this case, would be considered “declined.” Since our aim was to identify meaningful cognitive decline, we analyzed only those participants who “declined.” Participants who “improved” were categorized as unchanged for the following analyses.

To compare the diagnostic capability of the MoCA and the MMSE, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted. ROC curves were determined for each interval of the longitudinal study. The resulting ROC curves illustrated the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity at all possible cutoff values for the change in MoCA and MMSE scores. The area under the curve (AUC) represents the overall ability of the screening test to discriminate between two outcomes: the absence or presence of cognitive decline (Table 3). In this case, a greater AUC corresponds to a greater ability to detect cognitive decline. Pairs of observations consisted of the change in score on the MoCA or MMSE and the RCI classification for global cognitive decline at that same interval. Using the method of Delong et al., AUCs of the MoCA and MMSE for each interval were then compared.58 Additionally, the positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated at all thresholds for the decline in MoCA and MMSE scores.

As an exploratory measure, we developed an alternative classification system for cognitive decline using the cognitive diagnosis assigned at each evaluation.41 Cognitive decline was deemed present if a participant’s diagnosis changed from either NC to MCI, MCI to Dementia, or NC to Dementia (Table 5). We conducted another ROC analysis using the change in the cognitive diagnosis classification and the change in the MoCA or the MMSE score.

Results

General

The time elapsed between evaluations was as follows: 1.50 ± 0.19 years (T1 to T2), 1.50 ± 0.23 years (T2 to T3), and 1.69 ± 0.27 years (T3 to T4). In total, 353 case observations were included in this analysis. Baseline characteristics of the 156 participants with chronic ET are shown (Table 1). Additionally, summary data for the MoCA, the MMSE, and each neuropsychological test at every interval can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Frequency of Decline in Global Cognition

For the T1 to T2 interval, there were 27 of 156 (17.3%) cases with a decline in global cognition (Table 2). Twenty of 133 (15.0%) cases declined in global cognition for the T2 to T3 interval, while 12 of 64 (18.8%) cases declined for the T3 to T4 interval. Across all intervals, there were 59 of 353 (16.7%) observations of cognitive decline.

Change in Global Cognition

The AUCs of the MoCA and MMSE did not differ significantly at any interval (Table 3). Similarly, when all case observations across intervals were pooled for analysis, the AUCs did not differ significantly (Table 3 and Figure 1). According to guidelines established by Carter et al., these AUCs, which were all below 0.70, indicate that both the MoCA and the MMSE are poor tests.59

This poor performance is further reflected in the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA and the MMSE at various thresholds of decline. The MoCA had its highest sensitivity of 70.0% at the T2 to T3 interval, though it was accompanied by a low specificity of 42.5% at a threshold of 1-point decline. For the MMSE, the highest sensitivity was 66.7% while the corresponding specificity was 62.7% at a threshold of 1-point decline at the T3 to T4 interval (Supplementary Table 2).

Change in the Cognitive Diagnosis

For the T1 to T2 interval, 17 of 156 (10.9%) cases had cognitive diagnoses that changed for the worse. For the T2 to T3 interval, 19 out of 133 (14.3%) cases experienced a decline in the cognitive diagnosis and for T3 to T4, 11 out of 64 (17.2%) cases (Table 4).

The AUCs did not differ significantly for the change in the cognitive diagnosis at any interval (Table 5). Across intervals, the performance of both the MoCA and MMSE ranged from poor to fair.59 During the T1 to T2 interval, the MoCA achieved its highest sensitivity (90.9%) at a threshold of 1-point decline, yet the corresponding specificity was 56.6%. The MMSE’s highest sensitivity (80.0%) occurred during the T3 to T4 interval and was accompanied by a specificity of 63.0% at a threshold of 1-point decline (Supplementary Table 3).

Discussion

It is crucial to determine the level of cognitive function in ET patients. Current evidence suggests that the MoCA, which is considered more sensitive and specific, is superior to the MMSE in detecting MCI and dementia in the general population.32 Also administered serially, these brief tests are widely used to track changes in cognition over time in a myriad of cohorts with various neurological diseases32,35–37 Thus, it is essential to assess their ability to detect cognitive decline in ET patients.

Following Faust-Socher et al., we established neuropsychological testing as a standard measure of comparison and added the change in the cognitive diagnosis as an alternative approach to the method.38 Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that the MoCA was not significantly better than the MMSE at adequately detecting changes in cognition over 18-month intervals in ET patients. Both tests demonstrated a poor to fair ability to detect cognitive decline. Moreover, the sensitivities of the MoCA and the MMSE were generally low, and there was a tradeoff between high sensitivity and appropriate specificity.

This pattern of inadequacy was also noted by Faust-Socher et al. They conducted this analysis in a cohort of PD patients, 44% of which classified as PD-MCI at baseline, more than double the 17% of baseline ET-MCI in our cohort. Despite the higher prevalence of baseline MCI and greater likelihood of cognitive decline, they found no significant differences among the AUCs of the SCOPA-Cog, the MoCA, and the MMSE and a maximum sensitivity of 71% at a threshold of 1-point change on the SCOPA-Cog. Like us, they concluded that these screening tests performed poorly in detecting cognitive decline.38 Additionally, there have been other studies of the detection of cognitive decline in the PD population, though the results are conflicting. A 3-year longitudinal study developed a linear mixed effects model over time that found a significant decline in MMSE scores (baseline: 26.9 ± 2.8) but not MoCA scores (baseline: 23.5 ± 4.4).36 By contrast, a study of early PD patients observed that MoCA scores (baseline: 24.9 ± 3.5) but not MMSE scores (baseline: 27.3 ± 2.2) declined significantly.60 In further favor of the MoCA, a 30-month prospective study compared the changes in the mean MoCA (baseline: 24.6 ± 4.2) and MMSE scores (baseline: 28.2 ± 2.3) and found that the MoCA was more sensitive, particularly for PD patients with cognitive impairment.61

While the cognitive deficits in ET may be less severe than those in PD, they are still elements of the disease that require proper attention and treatment. A previous study that compared non-demented ET and PD patients to healthy controls found that the ET and PD groups shared similar cognitive profiles.62 Both groups performed more poorly than the control group in functions involving attention, executive function, and memory.62 Moreover, the COGNET study calculated an average annual conversion rate from ET-MCI to ET-D of 12.5%.63 This estimate is high compared to the range for the general population, which is 2.6%−6.3%,64–66 but lies within the range for PD, which is 7.6%−15.5%.67–70 Furthermore, a recent study indicated that both ET-MCI and ET-Dementia were associated with a substantial increase in risk of mortality.71 Thus, cognitive decline is clearly a greater burden in ET than in the general population. Though perhaps milder compared to cognitive decline in PD, if anything, this is further reason for utilizing more comprehensive testing in ET patients since, as the current study suggests, less severe decline may be more difficult to detect with brief cognitive screening tools.

Given the variability in performance across multiple studies, it is evident that judging the presence or absence of cognitive decline should not rely solely on screening tools, such as the MoCA and the MMSE. This raises the question: what is the ideal cognitive evaluation for monitoring ET patients over time? Current evidence suggests that a more detailed neuropsychological battery covering multiple cognitive domains is a more robust practice. Indeed, Weinstein et al. compared the ability of a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to that of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect MCI in older adults with a history of major depressive disorder in remission, MCI, or both. Having found 103 (23.8%) discrepancies out of which 91 (88.3%) cases demonstrated greater impairment in the neuropsychological evaluation, they concluded that the neuropsychological evaluation was superior in identifying cases of cognitive impairment.72

However, we realize the MoCA and the MMSE have their advantages in clinical settings, especially when it comes to their relative brevity. Thus, it would be beneficial to develop a brief test battery tailored to tracking cognitive decline, particularly at its early stages, in the ET population. Given the specific features of this decline, which have been noted in prior literature,6–8,24 such a battery would include tests designed to detect deficits in executive function and memory. Indeed, Cersonsky et al. found that the five tests most sensitive in detecting ET patients with CDR 0.5 covered the executive function and memory domains.73 Two of these tests, VFT Category Switching and CW Inhibition, would be strong contenders for such a battery since they are relatively brief, as participants have 60 and 180 seconds, respectively, to complete them.42

Alternatively, the cerebellar cognitive affective/Schmahmann syndrome scale (CCAS)74 could serve as the new screening tool for ET patients given the cerebellar dysregulation that has been discovered in ET.5 This test involves 10 items that measure semantic fluency, phonemic fluency, category switching, digit span forward and backward, cube draw and cube copy, delayed verbal recall, similarities, go/no-go, and evaluation of neuropsychiatric domains. Taking approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete, this test has demonstrated utility in assessing patients with cerebellar disorders.74 Future studies could assess whether this test would also be useful in the ET population.

Beyond neuropsychological testing, it is also important to consider the concerns expressed by caregivers and family members since patients developing dementia may have reduced awareness of cognitive decline.75 Moreover, in ET, a higher caregiver burden has been associated not with tremor symptoms but with non-tremor symptoms, including decreasing cognition and the perception of suffering in the ET patient.76 Clearly, it is imperative that both the ET patient and the caregiver receive the proper support and counseling in the face of cognitive decline.

Though not the aim of our study, also of note is the proportion of participants who demonstrated significant improvements in the neuropsychological test scores over time, which Faust-Socher et al. similarly noted in their PD cohort.38 These improvements have also been found in other longitudinal studies, including one of older adults with MCI or normal cognition.57,77,78 This phenomenon may be explained by practice effects since our ET cohort was administered the same version of each neuropsychological test at every evaluation. However, the influence of practice effects was likely minimized since testing occurred every 1.5 years.

Another consideration is our definition of meaningful cognitive improvement as an RCI cutoff of +1.65 on a minimum of two tests. While this cutoff has been used in previous studies, there is no general consensus on an appropriate cutoff for determining significant improvement in cognition.79–81 Faust-Socher et al. employed a higher cutoff of +1.96.38 Our cutoff of +1.65 may not have been high enough, leading to an inflated number of participants who classified as improved. This appears to be the case upon comparing the proportion of participants who classified as improved across all intervals via the RCI method (16.4%) versus the cognitive diagnosis method (3.4%). Regardless, these improvements were not the focus of our analysis. Our findings do not reflect the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive improvement.

We must acknowledge that there are some limitations to our study. First, the study design did not include a control group, which may have limited our ability to study the features of cognitive decline that are unique to the ET population. Second, due to the administration of the phone and virtual visit, many evaluations had to be excluded, making the analysis less powered, particularly for the T3 to T4 interval. Additionally, some cases with cognitive decline were not followed for subsequent evaluations because of death or discontinued participation. Thus, due to the stringent inclusion criteria or circumstances beyond our control, some cases that likely would have qualified for cognitive decline were not included in the analysis, creating a potential source of selection bias.

We also recognize that our alternate definition of cognitive decline via the change in the cognitive diagnosis may be considered a weakness since the MoCA and the MMSE scores are used to make the cognitive diagnosis. In other words, this exploratory analysis may be somewhat circular. However, compared to the other neuropsychological tests in our battery and the CDR score, the MoCA and the MMSE are minor components in determining the appropriate cognitive diagnosis. We also acknowledge that the inclusion of the Multilingual Aphasia Examination: Token Test may have been a limitation since its scores are typically not normally distributed. However, we repeated our analysis without the Token Test for the first and second intervals and found no significant change in our results. The AUCs of the MoCA and the MMSE at both intervals were not significantly different from each other (p’s &gt; 0.05), and their ability to detect cognitive ranged from poor to fair, which is what we established originally.

Finally, we acknowledge our deviation from the methods of Faust-Socher et al. in utilizing a 90% CI rather than a 95% CI. We chose a 90% CI given the nature of our ET cohort, which was inherently different from the PD cohort of Faust-Socher et al. The current ET cohort was relatively cognitively intact. In fact, only 17% of our ET cohort was classified as having baseline MCI compared to 44% of the PD cohort. This difference mirrors prior literature, which has found that the cognitive profile in ET differs from that in PD. Specifically, there is more severe impairment in PD and the conversion rate from MCI to dementia is higher in PD than in ET.8,62 Thus, we believed it would be more appropriate to use a 90% CI since it allowed us to capture slightly less severe cognitive decline, which is more characteristic in ET, thereby maximizing our ability to detect cognitive decline in our cohort. Still, despite this methodological deviation, our findings aligned with the results of Faust-Socher et al. One final point is that 90% CIs for reliable change are widely used in the literature, with a recent review reporting that this is the most common choice for CI width.57,82,83 Thus, we believe that our decision to use a 90% CI for our study is well-grounded in both the specifics of our sample and the practices of the RCI field.

In the face of these potential limitations, the study possessed considerable strengths. Following Faust-Socher et al., we employed the RCI method as a novel definition of change in cognition in an ET cohort, which to our knowledge, has not been explored in the past.38 Additionally, our alternate definition for cognitive decline, the change in the cognitive diagnosis over time, may render the analysis more robust since the cognitive diagnosis incorporates additional elements beyond neuropsychological testing, such as the CDR score, feedback from an informant, and behavioral observations from the research assistant. Another strength was the ET cohort from the COGNET study used in this analysis. The cohort consists of patients with chronic ET who have been followed longitudinally at regular intervals for nearly 5 years. Additionally, each participant has been carefully assigned an ET diagnosis by a movement disorders neurologist and a cognitive diagnosis by expert neuropsychologists.

Additionally, the COGNET study is ongoing. By the end of the study, many participants will have been followed for 7.5 years, at which point this comparison of the MoCA and the MMSE may be revisited and may provide more insight given the longer period of follow-up. Future studies could also apply the RCI method differently. Instead of calculating the RCI for each neuropsychological test over time, a composite cognitive score could be developed. The ability of the MoCA and the MMSE could then be compared to the RCIs of this composite score.

In conclusion, using neuropsychological testing and the assigned cognitive diagnosis as separate gold standards, we found that the ability of the MoCA and the MMSE to detect cognitive decline in ET patients over 18-month intervals is inadequate. Unchanged scores on the MoCA and the MMSE in ET over time should be approached with caution, as they cannot definitively rule out the possibility of cognitive decline. To enhance the tracking of cognitive decline in ET research and clinical practice, we propose that these screening tools should be supplemented with additional neuropsychological tests that address the specific cognitive concerns associated with ET.

Figure 1. ROC curves for the change in MoCA and MMSE scores at all intervals using change in global cognition as gold standard. A greater area under the curve (AUC) corresponds to a greater overall accuracy in detecting cognitive decline. The AUCs, which were 0.65 for the change in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score and 0.63 for that of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), did not differ significantly (p = 0.68), suggesting that neither test is superior.
