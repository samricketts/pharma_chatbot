Tau protein not only plays many important biological functions, but also associates with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is still a challenge to identify atomic structure of full-length tau proteins due to their lengthy and disordered characteristics, and the factor that there are no crystal structures of full-length tau proteins available. We performed multi- and large-scale of molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length tau monomer (the 2N4R isoform, 441 residues) in aqueous solution under biological conditions with coarse-grained and all-atom force fields. The obtained atomic structures produced radius of gyration and chemical shifts are in excellent agreement with experiment. The generated monomer structure ensemble would be very useful for further studying the oligomerization mechanism and discovering tau oligomerization inhibitors, which are important events in the AD drug development.

pmc1. INTRODUCTION

It has been over a century since Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was discovered, but a cure of this costly and challenging disease is still not available.1–3 The primary diagnostic pathological hallmarks of AD are insoluble objects, extracellular plaques of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of tau protein.4–6 Tau is a neuron-specific microtubule-associated protein (MAP). In a healthy neuron, tau binds to microtubules and regulates microtubule stability. It is generally believed that tau aggregation is initiated by post translational modifications on tau and the subsequent dissociation from microtubules, followed by conformational change to form NFTs and threads.4,5 Recent evidence has shown that compared to insoluble fibrils, soluble tau oligomers, formed in the early stage of aggregation, are the most toxic forms of tau aggregates which also include large pre-fibrillary and mature fibrillary structures.5,7 Tau oligomers cause neuronal damage, leading to neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury.8 Thus, understanding the tau oligomerization mechanisms and then identifying inhibitors of this pathogenic procedure would be a valid avenue to develop effective therapeutics for AD.9 However, the molecular mechanisms of tau oligomerization remain unclear, because it is still a challenge to identify atomic structure of full-length tau proteins due to their lengthy and disordered characteristics.

How exact the full-length tau adopts its conformations in solution remains controversial. Tau belongs to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) which are highly soluble and dynamic, with a low propensity to aggregate spontaneously in vitro.10 Therefore, under physiological conditions tau protein do not keep a stable ordered 3-dimensional (3D) architecture. Instead, it exhibits conformational diversity and adaptability, consisting a conformational ensemble. But a few studies suggested that tau adopt specific folded conformations like global hairpin folding11 as a soluble protein.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has proven to be an extremely powerful tool to complement experimental approaches on investigations of the structural and dynamic properties of biological systems at the microscopic level. However, due to the lack of crystal structure as reasonable starting conformation and the tremendous system size, it would be difficult to set up the simulation system and expensive to carry out MD simulations of full-length tau protein in explicit solvent. To date MD simulation studies on tau protein mostly focused on the fragments of tau instead of the full-length tau.12–24 Recently, simulation studies on tau have moved from very short fibril-nucleating cores, such as 275VQIINK280 and 306VQIVYK311 hexapeptide motifs, to longer fragments of tau such as K18 (130 residues covering the microtubule-binding domains).25, 26 During the preparation and reviewing process of this manuscript, several related publications emerged, including newly developed coarse-grained model on IDPs27,28 and algorithms/toolkits to generate structures ensembles of IDPs including K18 and tau from fragment libraries.29,30

Six different, tissue-specific tau isoforms have been found in the central nervous system (CNS) of adult human brains which are produced by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10 among the 16 exons of the MAPT gene.31 The isoforms are marked and named based on the number (0, 1, or 2) of presented 29-amino acid inserts (N) near the N-terminal end, and the number (3 or 4) of residual repeats (R) composed of 31 residues in the microtubule-binding domain near the C-terminus. These six tau isoforms are: 0N3R (352 residues), 1N3R (381 residues), 2N3R (410 residues), 0N4R (383 residues), 1N4R (412 residues), and 2N4R (441 residues). The 3R isoform is expressed mainly during the early development stage of the brain and the 4R isoform is expressed later in adulthood.32,33 Among these isoforms, 2N4R (also termed as hTau40) is the longest one.

It’s of great interests to perform molecular dynamics simulations on full-length tau protein to investigate the structural and dynamic features. However, a prominent hurdle is to obtain a good 3D model as the initial conformation. To date there is no crystal structure of full-length tau monomer in solution available. The related crystal structures deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) are almost all about aggregated tau fragments (Figure 1 and Table S1). The AlphaFold protein structure database34 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/) provides nearly 1 million proteins’ 3D structures predicted with an artificial intelligence method, which achieved the top-ranked performance with unprecedented accuracy during the CASP14 contest of blind prediction.35 We downloaded the predicted structure of human tau (gene: MAPT; source: homo sapiens; UniProt: P10636) from AlphaFold database. However, this structure is for the canonical sequence of tau (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636#P10636-1), which is also named as isoform PNS-tau or Big-tau. This isoform is expressed with a large additional exon (termed 4a) that doubles the size of the protein (758 residues) compared to the aforementioned six developmentally expressed isoforms.36 By removing the extra residues in the predicted structure of isoform PNS-tau from AlphaFold database, we obtained an initial conformation of 2N4R tau (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P10636#P10636-8) for the following MD simulations (Figure S1).

Another difficulty of simulating full-length tau protein is its large size and the demanding computational resources. The core of a MD simulation is the adopted mathematical model of intra- and inter-molecular interactions, termed force-field (FF). In a classical all-atom (AA) FF, a simulated particle represents an atom, while in a coarse-grained (CG) FF, a particle usually represents a group of atoms.37–39 MD simulations with CG FFs (CG-MD) can efficiently handle larger biomolecular systems in relatively longer time scale compared to MD simulations with AA FFs (AA-MD), because of reduced number of particles and interactions, smoother potential energy surfaces, and hence larger time steps. However, CG-MD has limitations in providing structural details at atomistic level. Therefore, it is a feasible and effective strategy to apply CG-MD first to sample more conformational space in an affordable time and cost, and then switch to AA-MD to obtain atomistic-resolution detail. In order to ascertain enough sampling, multiple individual MD runs can be conducted. Such a multi- and large-scale strategy is designed to overcome the hurdles of simulating the full-length tau protein, i.e., the lack of crystal structure as an accurate initial conformation, the lengthy size, and the disordered nature.

In this paper, we report our CG-MD and AA-MD simulation studies on the full-length tau protein in solution. The adopted CG FF is SIRAH2.0,40,41 which was recently developed and successfully used to model many large biomolecular systems,42,43 including IDPs.44,45 The adopted AA FF is Amber FF14SB.46 We have obtained structural features of full-length tau protein in well agreement with experimental results as described below. Our results have laid a good foundation for further investigations of tau oligomerization mechanism and rational design of inhibitors of this procedure as a cure for AD and other tauopathies.

2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1. The Radius of Gyration from Typical CG-MD Snapshots Agrees with Experiment.

Cluster analysis47 was carried out on the trajectory of the beginning 200-ns CG-MD, and representative snapshots were extracted as new initial conformations of in total 10 independent production CG-MD runs, and each run lasted 4.5 μs. By the time t = 2.5 μs, six of ten trajectories maintained the radius of gyration (ROG) above 6.0 nm during most of the simulation time, one trajectory had ROG fluctuated between 5.5 nm and 6.5 nm, whereas the ROG of other three trajectories gradually reduced down to ~4.7 nm (Figure 2A). Since then, more and more trajectories trend to compact. By the time t = 4.5 μs, two trajectories maintained ROG around 7.0 nm, two trajectories have ROG fluctuate around 6.0 nm, while the rest six trajectories shrink to ROG around 4.5 nm. The ROG of all ten CG-MD trajectories are within the ROG distribution range (around 3 to 11 nm) measured by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),48 but such shrinking behavior over long simulation time demonstrates the well-known difficulty of reproducing the delicate balance between protein-protein interaction and protein-water interaction for IDPs. Therefore, it is a realistic protocol to pick up CG-MD snapshots with ROG values close to the peak of experimental ROG distribution as starting conformations of the next AA-MD simulations. Based on the cluster analysis on the ten trajectories of first 2.5 μs (in total 25.0 μs), the frame numbers of the top two clusters account 17 % and 16 % of all snapshots, respectively, and their averaged ROG are 6.70 nm and 6.42 nm, respectively, which are very close to the averaged experimental observations (6.5 – 6.7 nm) with SAXS.48–50 From these top two clusters of CG-MD snapshots, 10 frames were extracted and back-mapped to AA representations as the initial conformations of the following-up AA-MD simulations. Based on the cluster analysis on the ten trajectories of all 4.5 μs (in total 45.0 μs), the frame number of the top cluster account 19 % of all snapshots, and the average ROG is 6.53 nm, again agree well with the experimental ROG.

2.2. The Radius of Gyration and Chemical Shifts from Typical AA-MD Runs Are Consistent with Experiment.

Ten individual AA-MD simulation runs were carried out starting from representative CG-MD snapshots as described above, and each run lasted 200 ns. The ROG of the 10 AA-MD trajectories is presented in Figure 2B. By the time t = 100 ns, six of the 10 trajectories maintained ROG above 6.0 nm, whereas the other four trajectories had their ROG gradually reduced to as low as ~5.0–5.5 nm. By the time t = 200 ns, one trajectory ROG increases to above 7.0 nm, two trajectory ROG drops from ~6.0 nm to ~5.5 nm. In general, the ROG evolutions of CG-MD and AA-MD are similar. Again, the shrinking and compacting behaviors of part trajectories are likely due to the limitation of adopted force fields in accurately and fully reproducing the delicate balance between protein-protein and protein-water interaction. Recently Pietrek et al. carried out AA-MD simulation of another IDP, α-synuclein (140 residues), with the Amber99SB*-ILDN-q force field and observed the same shrinking trend.51 With 100 ns simulation time, the averaged ROG of 20 trajectories of α-synuclein dropped from ~4.0 nm (slightly above the experimental value) to ~3.3 nm.51 One trajectory was further extended to 2 μs and the corresponding ROG reduced to ~2.0 nm.51 Any imbalance in the force field could be amplified over the extension of simulation time. In such scenarios, multiple trajectories with appropriate shorter simulation time may generate better representative and meaningful conformations than a single longer trajectory. Hence in this study we stopped all AA-MD simulations at t = 200 ns, and picked five trajectories which maintained ROG &gt; 6.0 nm during most of time for post-analysis. But it is of note that recent time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of single trapped tau protein in solution exhibited conspicuously bimodal distribution of anisotropy, indicating a more compact conformation family and a less compact conformation family.52–54 As to the five trajectories with ROG maintained above 6.0 nm at most of the simulation time, the averaged ROG is 6.61 nm, which is in excellent agreement with experimental values of 6.5 – 6.7 nm.48–50

These five AA-MD trajectories were further analyzed by calculating the chemical shifts of the N atoms in backbone. Chemical shifts measured by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are very useful to decipher the structure properties of proteins. Of note, it is still a major bottleneck to obtain a complete assignment of the backbone resonance of tau protein in solution due to its large molecular size and intrinsically disordered characteristics. To date, searching with the keyword “tau” in the Biological Magnetic Resonance (BMRB) data bank (https://bmrb.io/) would only return one record (BMRB Entry 50701, BMRB Entry DOI:10.13018/BMR50701) about the chemical shift data of free monomeric full-length tau protein. Other ~20 records returned are related to other states of tau fragments, such as filamentous/fibrillized tau fragments, phosphorylated or mutated tau fragments, tau fragments binding to another protein, etc. The deposition date of BMRB Entry 50701 is 2021-01-07, although it recommends a citation of published work in 2010.55 This entry provides 362 backbone 15N chemical shifts among the 441 residues of the monomeric wild full-length 2N4R tau, which is a perfect target to validate the structure trajectories from our AA-MD simulations. Chemical shifts of the backbone 15N were calculated using the program SPARTA+, which was based on artificial neural networking and trained on a large carefully pruned database of high-resolution X-ray structures.56 The root mean squared error (RMSE) between the calculated and experimental 15N chemical shifts for the aforementioned five AA-MD trajectories with well-maintained ROG drops from 1.88 parts per million (ppm) at t = 0 ns to 1.48 ppm at t = 60 ns. Since then, the instant RMSE (averaged over a short period around time t) slightly increases and fluctuates around 1.64 ppm, and the cumulative RMSE (averaged from 0 ns to time t) keeps at 1.49 ppm (Figure S2). The decrease of instant RMSE during the beginning 60 ns demonstrates the benefit of sampling brought by reliable simulation algorithms and FFs. The increase of instant RMSE implies that the effect of FF inaccuracy was amplified over time, supporting our point that multiple independent MD runs with appropriate time length could be a better protocol than fewer and longer runs in cases of simulating IDPs. The stable cumulative RMSE shows that the benefit of longer sampling has not be overwhelmed by the detriment of FF inaccuracy during the 200-ns simulation time. For comparison, the benchmark error of SPARTA+ is 2.45 ppm for 15N.56 Figure 3A shows the scatter plot of calculated backbone 15N chemical shifts from the aforementioned AA-MD trajectories versus the experimental values. The profiles of calculated 15N chemical shifts minus the experimental values along the residue sequence are shown in Figure S3 for each of the aforementioned AA-MD trajectory (panels A to E) and for their combination (panel F). The Pearson’s coefficient R is 0.93, which demonstrates an excellent agreement. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first MD simulation of full-length tau protein in solution verified with the experimental NMR 15N chemical shifts data. Comparing to the broad range of ~22 ppm for the experimental 15N chemical shifts data (minimum value 106.67 ppm, maximum value 128.99 ppm, standard deviation 4.70 ppm), the experimental backbone 1H(N) chemical shifts reported in BMRB Entry 50701 have an extremely narrow range of &lt; 1.0 ppm (minimum value 7.64 ppm, maximum value 8.60 ppm, standard deviation 0.15 ppm), and therefore it may not be an ideal target to compare. Nevertheless, we calculated the backbone 1H(N) chemical shifts and compared to corresponding experimental data: the RMSE is 0.19 ppm, and the Pearson’s coefficient R is 0.43. For comparison, the benchmark error of SPARTA+ is 0.49 ppm for 1H(N).56

Beside the accuracy of absolute chemical shift values, the deviations from statistical average values of random coil chemical shifts, which are usually called the secondary chemical shifts, are also a good indicator of local secondary structures.57 Mukrasch et al. reported the Cα secondary chemical shifts (ΔδCα) of full-length tau in figures,58 but unfortunately the raw data are not available. Nevertheless, we calculated ΔδCα with SPARTA+ and presented the result in Figure S4 in Supporting Information. Our result produced the overall features of Cα secondary chemical shifts along the full-length tau backbone comparing to the result by Mukrasch et al. (Fig. 5 in Ref 58). Specifically, the hexapeptide motif PHF6 (306VQIVYK311) consistently exhibits negative ΔδCα values indicating high beta-sheet content; but the ΔδCα values for the PHF6* (275VQIINK280) motif are not always negative as expected.

2.3. Global Fold Landscape of Full-Length Tau in Solution.

Figures 3B, 3C and 3D show three representative conformations of full-length tau in solution based on cluster analysis of the aforementioned five AA-MD trajectories with well-maintained ROG. The typical global structure of paired helical filaments (PHFs)59 of tau filaments was not found. The root mean squared fluctuations (RMSFs) of the residues calculated against the averaged structure in individual AA-MD trajectories are around 10 – 20 Å (Figure 4), which are ten folds larger than RMSFs of typical well-folded proteins and demonstrate the intrinsically disordered nature of tau. While the largely unfolded feature demonstrates the general disordered state which is a result of its high content of charged and hydrophilic residues, short-lived local compaction and folding do occur especially in the N1N2 domain and the microtubule-binding repeats. We calculated the secondary structure propensity of each residue using the program STRIDE60,61 on the aforementioned five AA-MD trajectories with well-maintained ROG (Figure 5A). There is a high propensity of helix structure at the C-terminus. This is partially due to the existence of the alpha helix in the predicted structure from the AlphaFold Protein Data Base as the starting conformation, and this helix remained during the CG-MD and AA-MD. Such an existence of helix structure at the C-terminus is reasonable because NMR experiments supported the preference for alpha-helical structure at this region.58,62,63 Mukrasch et al. observed the preference for alpha-helical structure at residues 428–437 for 25% of time. The over stability of helix structure for the hydrophobic C-terminal segment in our simulations compared to Mukrasch’s study may due to the limitation of adopted force field, but it is of note that other experimental and theoretical studies support stable helix structure of the same segment. For example, Esposito et al. applied 1H 2D NMR spectroscopy on the segment 423–441 of tau and obtained typical NMR evidence which is in consistent with an alpha-helix structure.62 Inputting the amino acid sequence of tau 2N4R into the website of JPred4 (https://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/), which is a protein secondary structure prediction server based on the JNet algorithm,64 returns a prediction result that the C-terminal segment 430–437 should be a helix with highest JNet reliability of prediction accuracy (9 out of the range from 0 to 9).

For other residues, the dynamic and local secondary structure elements exist with a low propensity, with a noticeable probability of ß-strands in the repeat domain R1-R’, which is the core of tau assembly. The experimentally observed β-like local conformations58 at 305–315 (in R3), 336–345 (in R4), and 351–357 (in R4) are also sampled by our simulation with close population sizes, but the similar β-strand populations at 256–262 (in R1) and 274–284 (in R2) are smaller in simulation than experiment. Also, the populations of β-structure content in other regions observed by experiment48 are either much smaller (86–92 in N2, 161–166 in P1) or not detectable (224–230 in P2) in simulation.

Previous studies indicated that the P301 residue in tau fragment K18 have a considerable fraction of turn conformers while its mutations favor more extended structures.29,30 By analysis with STRIDE, our simulated AA-MD trajectories averagely contain 7.6% population of turn structure at P301, with one trajectory has the highest propensity of 22.5% (Figure S5). Measurement of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and J-couplings on construct K18 of tau indicates turns for K254, N285, and S316.22 Our analysis with STRIDE on five AA-MD trajectories revealed a good agreement with experiment: the propensities of turns at K254, N285, and S316, are averagely 71.8%, 33.3%, and 90.6%, respectively.

Figure 5B and 5C shows the averaged Cα-Cα distances and corresponding standard deviations in the five AA-MD trajectories with well-maintained ROG. The profiles of NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE)28,58 for the same set of AA-MD trajectories are calculated with the program DEER-PREdict65 and shown in Figure S6, which capture the overall disordered and flexible nature of tau in solution, but the calculated intensity ratios are almost equal to one at positions far away from labelled residues indicates that the sampled structures are globally more extended than experiment, probably due to the fact that our post-analysis is performed over the chosen trajectories which maintain ROG &gt; 6.0 and excludes the more compact trajectories. With cluster analysis of AA-MD trajectories, we obtained representative structures of 2N4R tau conformations, which refers to the wild form of full-length tau protein monomer. These representative structures will be extremely useful for series of following-up studies, e.g., the effects of post translationally modifications (phosphorylation, mutation, truncation, etc.) on tau structures, the interactions between tau protein and other important bio-molecules (such as microtubule), the mechanism and inhibition of tau oligomerization, etc.

2.4. AA-MD of Full-Length Tau Monomer in Solution Revealed Different Structure Features with the Crystal Structures of Aggregated Tau Fragments.

Plenty of crystal structures of aggregated tau fragments exhibit several common patterns of tau single filament fold (mainly in the microtubule-binding domain) in vivo and in vitro, such as the Alzheimer’s disease Tau fold (PDB 6HRE), Pick’s disease Tau fold (6GX5), chronic traumatic encephalopathy Tau fold (6NWP), “snake” fold (6QJH), “twister” fold (6QJM), and “jagged” fold (6QJP).66 We applied 20-ns constrained AA-MD on the seven crystal structures, and calculated the RMSE of 15N chemical shifts of residues in these structures versus the corresponding ones from experimental NMR data for 2N4R monomer in solution. For comparison, we also calculated the RMSE of 15N chemical shifts of corresponding residues from our normal unrestrained AA-MD of full-length tau. As demonstrated in Table 1, the RMSEs of restrained MD simulations of the crystal structures are all higher than those of corresponding residues in normal MD simulation of full-length tau monomer in solution. This result indicates that the local structures from our normal AA-MD simulation of full-length tau protein should be closer to real scenarios of tau monomer in solution than the crystal structures of tau fragment single filaments (Figure 6).

3. CONCLUSIONS

We carried out a series of coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and all-atom (AA) MD simulations on the full-length tau protein (2N4R isoform, 441 residues) in solution, and obtained radius of gyration and chemical shifts fully consistent with the experiment data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD simulation study of full-length tau protein validated by comparing calculated and experimental chemical shifts. The revealed global and local structure features of tau monomer in solution are different from the tau single filaments in crystal structures. This study paves the way to further investigations of the interactions between tau protein and other important bio-molecules (such as microtubules), post-translational modifications of tau, tau oligomerization mechanism, and eventually rational design of tau oligomerization inhibitors which is a prospectively effective therapeutic solution for AD.

4. COMPUTATIONAL METHODS

A CG or AA version of full-length 2N4R tau protein was put in the middle of a truncated octahedron simulation box, solvated with explicit CG or AA version of water and 0.15 M concentration of Na+ and Cl− ions. The minimum distance between any particle/atom of protein and the box edges was 15 Å for CG-MD and 12 Å for AA-MD. All of the protein, ions and water in CG-MD were described with the SIRAH2.0 FF.41 As to AA-MD, the protein was described with the Amber FF14SB protein force field,46 water was treated by TIP3P water model,67 and the parameters of ions were from Joung &amp; Cheatham.68,69 Conventional MD simulations were carried out using AMBER18 biomolecular simulation package.70 The topologies were prepared with the ANTECHAMBER module in AMBER suite.71 The minimization and equilibration steps were performed with the parallel central processing units (CPU) version of MD module (pmemd.MPI) in AMBER18, and the production steps were conducted with the graphic processing unit (GPU)-accelerated module (pmemd.CUDA).72,73 The isothermal–isobaric ensemble (NPT) with the periodic boundary condition was applied to all simulations, with pressure P = 1 atm. and temperature T = 300 K. The time step was 20 fs for CG-MD and 1 fs for AA-MD. The cut-off distance for non-bonded van der Waals interaction was set to 12 Å for CG-MD and 10 Å for AA-MD.
