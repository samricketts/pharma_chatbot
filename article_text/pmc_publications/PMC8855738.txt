Introduction:

The goal was to investigate effects of APOE-TOMM40-’523 haplotypes on cognitive decline in non-demented non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB), and determine whether effects differ from non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).

Methods:

The impact of zero to two copies of the ‘523-Short variant (S; poly-T alleles &lt; 20) within apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype on a composite measure of global cognition and five domains was examined.

Results:

In NHB with ε3/ε3 (N = 294), ‘523-S/S was associated with faster decline in global cognition (β = −0.048, P = 0.017), episodic memory (β = −0.05, P = 0.031), and visuospatial ability (β = −0.037, P = 0.034) relative to those without ‘523-S. For NHB ε4+ (N = 182), ‘523-S/S had slower decline in global cognition (β = 0.047, P = 0.042) and visuospatial ability (β = 0.07, P = 0.0005) relative to ‘523-S non-carriers. NHB ε4+ with ‘523-S also had a slower rate of decline than NHWs ε4+ with ‘523-S.

Discussion:

‘523-S/S has a different effect on cognitive decline among NHB dependent on APOE allele. Differences in the effect of ε4-’523-S in NHB may explain prior mixed findings on ε4 and decline in this population.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Carriage of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 alleles influences rates of cognitive decline in older, non-Hispanic White (NHW) adults free of dementia.1,2 For individuals who self-identify as non-Hispanic Black (NHB), literature has been mixed with some studies suggesting ε4 has a weaker effect on cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk,3–6 while others suggest no difference.7,8 Alleles of the APOE genotype are in linkage disequilibrium with the length of poly-T repeats at the rs10524523 (‘523) locus of the translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane-40 kD (TOMM40) gene in NHW, such that ε3 is linked with both ‘523-Short (S, ≤19 T-alleles) and ‘523-very long (VL, ≥30 T-alleles), whereas ε4 is only linked with ‘523-long (L, 20–29 T-alleles).9–11 Interestingly, this pattern differs among NHB. While ε3 is linked with ‘523-S and ‘523-VL as it is in NHW, the ε4 allele can be linked with ‘523-S, ‘523-L, or ‘523-VL.12,13 Thus, NHB that are ε4+ have far more heterogeneity in APOE-TOMM40 poly-T haplotypes than their NHW ε4+ counterparts.

This study expands our previous work in NHW, which showed that ε3-’523-S was associated with faster cognitive decline relative to non-’523-S, consistent with another report.14,15 We also showed that ε4-’523-L had a stronger effect on AD risk than other ε4-’523 haplotypes in NHB.16 Given the presence of heterogeneity in NHB APOE-’523 haplotypes, it is critical to explore these haplotypes with cognitive decline in NHBs. We hypothesized that consistent with prior reports, ‘523-S would be related to faster cognitive decline among ε3/ε3 carriers, but among NHB-ε4 carriers, ‘523-S would be protective against cognitive decline.

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Participants

Data come from 2267 participants in three longitudinal community-based studies of aging and dementia with identical data collection, facilitating merging of the datasets and increasing power to examine associations across racial groups. Participants for this study were from the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), the Religious Orders Study (ROS), or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). MARS started in 2004 and is a longitudinal study of risk factors for cognitive decline in community-dwelling Blacks aged 65 years or older from the Chicago metropolitan area.17 ROS started in 1993 and is a clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging and AD in older persons from across the United States.18 Rush MAP started in 1997 and is a clinical-pathologic cohort study of risk factors for common chronic conditions of old age in older persons from northeastern Illinois.19 Participants were included in a single analytic sample if they self-identified as NHW or NHB (n = 3958), non-demented at baseline (n = 3749), and had APOE and TOMM40 genotyping available (n = 2595). The mean years of follow-up in NHB was 7.3 years (standard deviation [SD] = 4.0) and NHW had 8.9 years (SD = 5.4). All studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rush University Medical Center. Written informed consent was acquired from each participant.

2.2 | Genotyping

APOE alleles were directly genotyped using polymorphisms rs429358 and rs7412, and TOMM40 ‘523 alleles from rs10524523 using DNA from peripheral blood or post mortem brain tissue as previously described.14,20 Participants were classified as ε4 carriers (ε4+) if at least one or more ε4 alleles was present (ε3/ε4, ε4/ε4) or ε4− if no ε4 alleles were present (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε3/ε3). ε2/ε4 carriers were excluded from the analysis given that their risk for disease is unclear (n = 29 NHB; n = 38 NHW). ‘523 variants were classified based on poly-T length as previously defined10: ≤ 19 T’s = Short (S), 20–29 T’s = Long (L), and ≥ 30 T’s = very long (VL). A subset of participants who were ε3/ε4 heterozygotes also had strand-specific (phased) haplotype data, which was used to directly observe APOE-’523 haplotype distribution.

2.3 | Cognitive assessments

Nineteen neurocognitive tests were administered to participants at baseline and each follow-up visit. Raw scores from the 19 cognitive tests were z-transformed using the baseline mean and SD of the combined cohorts, and averaged to compute a global composite measure. Subsets of the 19 tests were then used to derive scores for the five cognitive domains, including episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability, based in part on a previous factor analysis.21 The cognitive domains and individual tests included episodic memory (Word List Memory, Recall, and Recognition from Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease [CERAD], Immediate and Delayed Recall of the East Boston Story and Logical Memory), semantic memory (Boston Naming Test, Verbal Fluency from CERAD, and a reading test), working memory (Digit Span Forward, Digit Span Backward, and Digit Ordering), visuospatial ability (Line Orientation and Progressive Matrices), and processing speed (Digit Symbol, Number Comparison, and two indices [color and name reading] from the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test).

2.4 | Other covariates

Demographic covariates were from the baseline evaluation. Participants self-reported their race using categories from the 1990 US Census. Ethnicity (Latino, yes/no) and sex (male, female) were self-reported. Age was based on date of birth to date of the baseline cognitive assessment. Education was measured in years of formal schooling completed.

2.5 | Statistical analysis

Demographic differences between racial groups (NHB, NHW) were assessed with a t test (continuous variables) or a chi-squared test (categorical variables). Analyses were first run in the full sample, and then in a sample of NHB and NHW matched as a sensitivity analysis. Mahalanobis distance was used to match NHW participants (N = 718) to NHB participants (N = 341) according to the pre-selected variables of age, education, sex, and follow-up time. Follow-up time was included because the NHB participants had shorter follow-up times than the NHW participants.

To assess if ‘523 genotype was associated with cognitive decline, linear mixed models (LMMs) included the interaction of time from baseline with 0, 1, or 2 copies of the ‘523-S genotype. We examined pairwise contrasts (0 vs. 1 ‘523-S; 0 vs. 2 ‘523-S; 1 vs. 2 ‘523-S). ‘523 genotype was dichotomized if the aforementioned group sizes were less than 30 participants: two copies of ‘523-S versus 1 or 0 copies of ‘523-S. Models were first conducted separately in NHB and NHW groups, within ε4+ and ε4− groups (yielding a total of four primary models: NHB ε4−, NHB ε4+, NHW ε4−, and NHW ε4+). To determine whether ‘523 genotype was different between NHB and NHW participants, we additionally conducted LMMs with both groups and added a three-way interaction between time x ‘523 genotype x race (in ε4− and ε4+ groups separately). All models included a random intercept and slope, and covariates for age, education, and sex, as well as the interaction between these covariates with time from baseline. Finally, LMMs were repeated additionally controlling for ε4+ (ε4/ε4 vs. ε3/ε4) within ε4 models to ensure effects were not driven primarily by a dose effect of ε4. All analyses were performed using R v3.4.1.

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Demographics

On average, NHB were younger, more likely to have at least one ε4 allele, and more likely to be female compared to NHW. NHB also had a shorter period of follow-up length and fewer years of education relative to NHW. In secondary analyses, we matched the two groups on these demographic characteristics and created a smaller cohort of NHB and NHW for sensitivity analyses (Table 1).

3.2 | APOE-TOMM40 ‘523 haplotypes

Examination of poly-T length by APOE allele in NHB and NHW revealed a similar distribution to previous reports.13 Specifically, in NHW ε3 was associated with two clusters of T length: one with a peak at 16 T’s (range = 15–17) corresponding to S and a cluster with a peak at 34 T’s (range = 30–39) corresponding to VL (Figure 1A). In NHW, ε4 was associated with two clusters of T-alleles within the L range (one cluster had a peak at 22 and the other cluster had a peak at 28 T’s, range = 27–29; Figure 1B). For NHB, ε3 was associated with three clusters of T alleles: one with a peak at 16 T’s corresponding to S, a second peak around 33 T’s corresponding to VL (range = 30–37), and a very infrequent third peak around 48 T’s (range = 46–53; Figure 1C). ε4 was also associated with three clusters of T-alleles in NHB: the first cluster had a peak at 15 T’s corresponding to S (range = 15–16), the second cluster had a peak at 22 T’s corresponding to L (range = 21–22), and the third cluster had a peak at 33 T’s corresponding most closely to VL (range = 28–33; Figure 1D).

3.3 | ‘523 variation and decline in global cognition

In NHB that are ε3/ε3, approximately 90% (N = 265) have the ‘523-S length, which we hypothesized to have a greater risk for decline compared to those with ε3/ε3 that did not have ‘523-S (N = 29 [10%], Table 1). We observed that two copies of ‘523-S (‘523-S/S) was associated with a faster rate of decline in global cognition compared to ε3/ε3 without an S in NHB (β = −0.048, standard error [SE] = 0.02, P = 0.017) but not compared to those with only one ‘523-S. There was a significant effect of ‘523 genotype for global cognition at baseline, such that ‘523-S/S was associated with worse cognition than those without ‘523-S (β = −0.178, SE = 0.088, P = 0.044). Even after including baseline cognition as an additional covariate, ‘523-S/S was still associated with faster global cognitive decline compared to the group without ‘523-S (β = −0.045, SE = 0.021, P = 0.027).

Given that the ε3/ε3, NHB group without ‘523-S had only 29 participants, we subsequently repeated the analysis combining the one S and no S into one group (referred to as non-S/S, n = 146). Comparing ‘523-S/S with the non-S/S group for NHB, the effect of ‘523-S/S was reduced but remained significant for global cognition (β = −0.023, SE = 0.012, P = 0.047; Table 2). To determine whether the association of ‘523-S/S with global cognitive decline was different from that observed in NHW, we performed subsequent analyses in a secondary analysis with NHB and NHW matched on key demographics. The effect of ‘523-S/S compared to non-S/S on global cognition for the matched NHW group was only trend level (global cognition: β = −0.019, SE = 0.01, P = 0.056). An additional analysis adding the three-way interaction of time, haplotype, and race (time x ‘523-S/S status x race [NHB or NHW]) was completed to determine whether any racial group differences were observed with ‘523-S/S and cognitive decline. The three-way interaction was not significant (β = 0.011, SE = 0.02, P = 0.547), suggesting that ‘523-S/S is associated with similar rates of cognitive decline across both NHB and NHW (Figure 2 A–C).

Among the NHB ε4+ group, 74% had the ‘523-S length (Table 1). ε4+ without ‘523-S was associated with a faster rate of global cognitive decline compared to ‘523-S/S (β = −0.047, SE = 0.023, P = 0.042; Table 3). The rate of decline did not differ between ‘523-S/S and only one ‘523-S. Given that ε4/ε4 poses a greater risk for AD than ε3/ε4, we repeated this analysis additionally controlling for ε4 genotype (ε4/ε4 vs. ε3/ε4). The effect of ε4+ without ‘523-S on global cognitive decline remained unchanged (β = −0.045, SE = 0.023, P = 0.048). Interestingly, the effect of ε4/ε4 versus ε3/ε4 on cognitive decline was not significant (β = −0.026, SE = 0.022, P = 0.23).

To determine whether the association of ‘523-S/S in ε4+ with cognitive decline for NHB was different from ε4+ in NHW, we performed secondary analyses in a matched NHB and NHW sample. Considering that all ε4 alleles are associated with ‘523-L in NHW, the NHW ε4+ group was treated as a single group. Compared to NHW ε4 carriers, NHB ε4 carriers with ‘523-S/S and ‘523-one S had significantly slower decline in global cognition (‘523-S/S vs. NHW, β = 0.068, SE = 0.023, P = 0.014; ‘523-one S vs. NHW: β = 0.072, SE = 0.02, P = 0.0003; Figure 3A). NHB without ‘523-S was not significantly different from NHW (β = 0.024, SE = 0.025, P = 0.33). These results remained when excluding NHW ε4+ non-S carriers (‘523-S/S vs. NHW, β = 0.074, SE = 0.028, P = 0.0092; ‘523-one S vs. NHW: β = 0.075, SE = 0.02, P = 0.0004).

3.4 | ‘523 variation and decline across five cognitive domains in ε3/ε3

The LMMs were repeated in five individual cognitive domains to determine whether there was a selective effect of ‘523 genotype. In NHB ε3/ε3 carriers, we observed that two copies of ‘523-S (‘523-S/S) were associated with a faster rate of decline in episodic memory and visuospatial ability compared to those without ‘523-S (episodic memory: β = −0.05, SE = 0.023, P = 0.031; visuospatial ability: β = − 0.037, SE = 0.017, P = 0.034) but not compared to those with only one ‘523-S. Repeating the analysis combining the one S and no S into one group (referred to as non-S/S, n = 146), we observed that the effect of ‘523-S/S was no longer significant for episodic memory (β = −0.016, SE = 0.24, P = 0.24) or visuospatial ability (β = − 0.018, SE = 0.011, P = 0.095; Table 2), suggesting a dose-dependent genetic effect of ‘523-S on episodic memory and visuospatial ability in NHB.

To determine whether the association of ‘523-S/S with decline in episodic memory and visuospatial ability was different from that observed in NHW, we performed secondary analyses in a matched NHB and NHW sample. The effect of ‘523-S/S compared to non-S/S on episodic memory in the matched NHW group was almost identical to the full NHW group; however, the significance was only trend level (β = −0.022, SE = 0.012, P = 0.067). The effect was no longer significant for visuospatial ability (β = −0.011, SE = 0.01, P = 0.196). An additional analysis adding an interaction term that included race (time x ‘523-S/S status x race [NHB or NHW]) was conducted to determine whether any racial group differences were observed for ‘523-S/S with cognitive decline in these two domains. No significant difference between ‘523-S/S and racial groups was observed (episodic memory: β = 0.0004, SE = 0.022, P = 0.982; visuospatial ability: β = −0.01, SE = 0.015, P = 0.455; Figure 2).

3.5 | ‘523 variation and decline across five cognitive domains in ε4 carriers

In NHB ε4+, participants without ‘523-S had a faster decline in visuospatial ability compared to ε4+ ‘523-S/S (β = −0.07, SE = 0.02, P = 0.0005; Table 3). The rate of decline did not differ between ‘523-S/S and those with only one ‘523-S. Additionally controlling for ε4 genotype (ε4/ε4 vs. ε3/ε4) did not change the results, suggesting that the effect was not confounded by the number of ε4 alleles (visuospatial ability: β = −0.069, SE = 0.02, P = 0.0006).

To determine whether the association of ‘523-S/S in ε4+ with cognitive decline was different from ε4+ in NHW, we performed secondary analyses in a matched NHB and NHW sample. Compared to NHW ε4 carriers, NHB ε4 carriers with ‘523-S/S and ‘523-one S had significantly slower decline in visuospatial ability (‘523-S/S vs. NHW, β = 0.065, SE = 0.023, P = 0.0048; ‘523-one S vs. NHW: β = 0.051, SE = 0.016, P = 0.0021) compared to non-’523-S carriers (Figure 3B). NHB without ‘523-S was not significantly different from NHW (visuospatial ability: β = −0.01, SE = 0.021, P = 0.614).

4 | DISCUSSION

The role of APOE ε4 has been well established for cognitive decline in dementia-free NHWs and NHBs.1–4,8,22 The role of TOMM40 ‘523, however, has been controversial. This is largely due to the fact that TOMM40 and APOE are in linkage disequilibrium precluding assessment of statistically independent effects.23 This is particularly true for disentangling the effect of TOMM40 and APOE in NHW, because the ε4 allele is almost always linked to ‘523-L. Consistent with this linkage, it is often reported that ‘523 variation provides no additional information for AD risk beyond that of ε4, while mixed results are observed regarding any independent effect of ‘523 in ε3/ε3 carriers.14–16,24–30 However, like most research on genetic markers of AD, these studies were performed in predominantly NHW populations, limiting the generalizability of findings. Considering little work has been done to investigate APOE-’523 haplotypes in NHBs, we aimed to determine whether different APOE-’523 haplotypes were associated with cognitive decline in NHB participants and to determine whether this effect was different relative to NHW participants. We first confirmed that TOMM40 ‘523 T-length stratified by APOE genotype was more heterogeneous in NHB relative to NHW, similar to previous studies.12,13 Our investigation of APOE-’523 haplotypes with cognitive decline suggested ‘523 variation differentially influenced ε4-related cognitive decline between NHB and NHW participants. For NHB ε4 carriers, ‘523-S was protective against cognitive decline (i.e., not having an S allele was related to faster cognitive decline), and this effect was also significantly different from that of NHW ε4 carriers (who are a homogenous group relative to ‘523). For ε3/ε3 carriers, for which ‘523 variability exists in both NHW and NHB, ‘523-S was associated with faster cognitive decline across both NHW and NHB groups.

In NHW, previous reports of ε3-’523 haplotype and cognition have suggested that ‘523-S promotes faster cognitive decline,14,15,30 with only one study suggesting ‘523-S is protective against decline.31 Within ROS and MAP, Yu et al.14 originally found that NHW with ‘523-S/S had faster decline relative to ‘523-S/VL and ‘523-VL/VL for global cognition, primarily due to episodic and semantic memory. Our study, using expanded datasets (more participants, longer follow-up length) described in Yu et al., also observed NHW with ‘523-S/S was associated with increased decline in global cognition and episodic memory relative to ‘523-S non-carriers. We expanded these analyses to include the NHB participants from ROS/MAP and MARS. Our results in NHB ε3/ε3 carriers are consistent with the previous studies in NHW such that NHB with the ‘523-S/S variant had faster decline relative to those without a ‘523-S in global cognition, episodic memory, and visuospatial ability. The effect of ‘523-S in NHB was not different from that in NHW, except for the addition of an effect in visuospatial ability. This observation is in line with our hypothesis that, considering the APOE ε3-’523 distribution is similar between the two racial groups, we expected to see a similar effect of ‘523-S on cognitive decline.

To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the association of ‘523 variants and cognition in ε4 carriers within individuals who self-identify as NHB. Roughly 74% of NHB participants that would typically be classified as ε4 positive, or high risk for AD, were protected against decline in global cognition and visuospatial ability if they carried at least one copy of ‘523-S. Studies investigating the effect of ε4 on cognitive decline in NHB before the stages of dementia have been mixed,3,4,7,22,32 and our findings implicate ‘523 variants as a potential reason for the discrepant results. For example, the number of NHB ε4 participants carrying at least one copy of ‘523-S may reduce the overall effect of the ε4 group on cognitive decline. Alternatively, NHB ε4 groups that largely have no copies of ‘523-S could cause an overall stronger ε4 effect on cognitive decline. Interestingly, a previous study using the same Rush cohorts used in this study showed the rate of cognitive decline for ε4 carriers was not different from non-ε4 carriers in NHB for semantic memory, working memory, and visuospatial ability.4 This further supports ‘523-S as protective against cognitive decline in ε4 carriers. Relative to NHW ε4 carriers, who do not typically carry a copy of ‘523-S, NHB ε4 carriers who had at least one copy of ‘523-S also had significantly slower rates of cognitive decline. Few studies directly investigated the differential effect of ε4 on cognitive decline between NHB and NHW but have predominantly suggested the effect of ε4 on cognitive decline is reduced in NHB, and is not statistically different between the racial groups.7,33 Our findings further implicate ‘523-S as a protective marker for cognitive decline and may be why previous reports have not found a difference between the two groups. If true, we would expect to see that NHB ε4 carriers without a copy of ‘523-S have similar decline relative to NHW ε4 without ‘523-S. Indeed, there was no difference in the effect on cognitive decline between NHB ε4 carriers without ‘523-S and NHW ε4 carriers. This also supports our previous hypothesis that the lack of effect on cognitive decline in the ε4 group as a whole may be due to those individuals carrying a copy of ‘523-S.

The biological basis of the differential effects of ‘523-S in ε4+ compared to ε3/ε3 is uncertain. A systematic review of TOMM40 ‘523 studies suggested that the identity of the TOMM40 poly-T risk allele depends on the phenotype being evaluated, ages of the study participants at the time of assessment, and context of the APOE genotypes.34 There is evidence to suggest that ‘523 variants may influence the integrity of AD-specific brain regions. Previous evidence suggests ε3/ε3-’523-VL carriers exhibited higher levels of tau pathology35 and ‘523-L and ‘523-VL were associated with thinner entorhinal cortices relative to ‘523-S in non-ε4 carriers only.27 Decreased gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate and precuneus,25 regions known to be affected early in AD, were also observed in ε3/ε3-’523-VL carriers; however, a later study suggests this effect may be observed only in those who had a positive family history of AD.15 Another possible mechanism is protein expression. TOMM40 lies just upstream of APOE, providing the possibility that APOE mRNA and protein expression are modulated by an extended APOE-TOMM40 haplotype.36 Future work across diverse populations is needed to better understand the biological mechanism of ‘523.

Limitations for this study include sample size and differences in population characteristics. There were fewer NHB participants than NHW, and the NHB group was younger, had fewer years of education, and shorter follow-up length. To address these potential limitations, we repeated analyses in matched NHB and NHW groups and observed nearly identical beta effects on cognitive decline. Although matched groups with smaller sample sizes were ultimately used for this study, the power to detect effects may have been limited.

In conclusion, this study suggests that the ‘523-S genotype has differential effects of cognitive decline as a function of APOE genotype, in non-demented NHB participants. The ε4-’523-S haplotype may help define a protected group in the NHB population that is different than the NHW population. These findings highlight the importance of investigations assessing genetic variants across ethnically/racially diverse populations.

HIGHLIGHTS

We assessed the impact of APOE-TOMM40 ‘523 haplotypes on cognition in Blacks.

Blacks with APOE3/3 and the ‘523-Short/Short genotype had worse cognitive decline.

Blacks with APOE4 and ‘523-Short/Short genotype had better cognition over time.

Racial group differences in APOE4 may be due to ‘523 genotype.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: We searched PubMed for articles on apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane-40 (TOMM40) in older adults who identified as Black or White. These publications are appropriately cited.

Interpretation: Our analyses suggest that the TOMM40 ‘523-Short genotype has differential effects on cognitive decline as a function of APOE genotype in Black participants. The effect of ‘523-Short in Black APOE ε4 carriers may define a protected group that is different from the White population.

Future directions: A larger sample size is warranted for future studies to better understand how the lesser common APOE and TOMM40 haplotypes impact cognitive decline.
