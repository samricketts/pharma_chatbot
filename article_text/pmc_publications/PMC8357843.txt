Objectives:

Inadequate financial and health literacy presents a formidable public health and economic challenge in old age. This study investigated declining financial and health literacy in relation to decision making performance, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing.

Design:

Longitudinal study

Setting:

A community-based cohort in Northeastern Illinois, USA

Participants:

1,046 older adults who were free of dementia at baseline and underwent annual clinical and literacy assessments.

Measurements:

Financial and health literacy, decision making, scam susceptibility, and psychological wellbeing were assessed using validated instruments. Linear mixed effects models estimated person-specific rates of change in financial and health literacy, and multivariable regression analyses examined the associations of declining literacy with subsequent levels of decision making, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing.

Results:

The mean age was 81 years and 76% were female. Over up to 10 years of annual follow-ups, the average financial and health literacy score dropped 1 percentage point a year. Substantial variability in decline was observed between participants. Faster decline in financial and health literacy was associated with poorer decision making, higher scam susceptibility, and lower psychological wellbeing. Notably, these associations were above and beyond the baseline literacy level and persisted even after controlling for cognition.

Conclusions:

Most community-dwelling older adults experience decline in financial and health literacy over time, but decline is not inevitable. Declining literacy is related to poorer decision making, greater scam susceptibility and lower wellbeing. These findings suggest that efforts to mitigate declining financial and health literacy may promote independence and wellbeing in old age.

pmcOBJECTIVE

Financial and health literacy, the acquisition, processing and utilization of financial and health information to facilitate effective decisions (1), is of particular importance to successful aging in modern society. Every day, thousands of older Americans are confronted with a series of financial and healthcare challenges ranging from planning for retirement, making investment decisions, to choosing Medicare coverage and signing up for healthcare services. Alarming data have shown that older adults are highly vulnerable to poor financial and health literacy (2). In a nationally representative survey of older Americans, a significant proportion of respondents failed to understand basic concepts of compound interest, inflation or mutual funds (3). Older adults also lack financial sophistication in areas such as risk diversification, asset valuation, portfolio choice and investment fees (4). Similarly, many older adults lack the fundamental health literacy necessary to maneuver the current healthcare environment. The high prevalence of inadequate health literacy is not only confined to older patients in public hospital settings (5), but is also widely observed among older community residents (6). In a previous American Medical Association report (7), approximately a third of English-speaking and separately over a half of Spanish-speaking Medicare enrollees in managed care facilities had inadequate or only marginal health literacy.

Low financial and health literacy have major implications for the overall wellbeing of older adults. In particular, older persons with poor financial and health literacy tend to make suboptimal financial and healthcare decisions (8–11) and are more susceptible to financial scams (12, 13). Further, low financial and health literacy is also associated with poor mental health. Prior studies reported that individuals with inadequate health literacy have worse mental health functioning, and that older adults with lower financial and health literacy tend to have more depressive symptoms and are more emotionally isolated (14, 15). Notably, research on the impacts of financial and health literacy to date has relied almost exclusively on cross-sectional data. Emerging evidence suggests that financial and health literacy is not static and may change across the lifespan. One study reported that financial literacy deteriorates after age 60 (16) and a study on the life-cycle pattern of financial mistakes suggests that financial literacy and decision making likely follow an inverse U-shape pattern that peaks in middle-age (17). Decline in health literacy among aging populations has been reported as well (18). With financial and health literacy declining in old age, it raises an important question on whether the consequences of inadequate financial and health literacy in old age are driven primarily by starting levels of literacy, age-related decline in literacy, or both.

To address this knowledge gap, we present a conceptual model of declining financial and health literacy and its impacts in old age (Supplementary Materials). Briefly, we hypothesize that starting levels (i.e. financial and health literacy accumulated through earlier life experiences) and rates of decline (i.e. age-related deterioration in literacy) vary across individuals, and both are important determinants of adverse outcomes. Older adults with lower level of financial and literacy and/or faster declining literacy tend to make poorer financial and health decisions, are more vulnerable to financial fraud and scams, and have lower wellbeing. Importantly, this model was built upon overwhelming cross-sectional findings that link poor financial and health literacy to adverse outcomes as well as prior evidence of declining literacy in old age. The relationships presented in the model are in general consistent with and complementary to prior theoretical frameworks on various causal pathways that link literacy to financial and health outcomes (19–22). In the current work, we test our conceptual model by leveraging data from over 1,000 community-dwelling older adults with an average 80 years of age. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which declining financial and health literacy are associated with subsequent decision making performance, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing, above and beyond the effects of starting level of literacy.

METHODS

Study participants

The present study included 1,046 older persons from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). MAP, started in 1997, is an ongoing cohort study of common chronic conditions of aging that include (but are not limited to) Alzheimer’s and other dementias, motor impairment and Parkinsonism, as well as physical frailty and disability (23). The study recruits older residents throughout northeastern Illinois of the United States, and participants primarily come from continuous care retirement communities and subsidized housing facilities. A decision making substudy was introduced in 2010. As of May 31, 2020, 1,698 MAP participants were alive and active since the start of the decision making substudy. 214 were ineligible for the substudy due to reasons such as moving out of the geographical area, language barriers, or severe sensory impairment. Of the remaining 1,484, 1,277 (86.1%) had completed the baseline literacy assessment. In order to estimate person-specific change in financial and health literacy over time, the analyses were restricted to participants with at least 2 literacy assessments (N=1,088). We further excluded participants who were demented by the baseline literacy assessment (N=42), resulting in an analytic sample size of 1,046. Participants were followed annually for up to 10 years (Mean: 4.8 years, SD: 2.9). In examining the associations of declining literacy with adverse outcomes, approximately 5% of the total sample were excluded from the regression analyses due to incomplete data for income or outcome measure.

Both the MAP parent study and the decision making substudy were approved by an institutional review board of the Rush University Medical Center. Participants signed informed consents and agreed to annual home visits that include detailed clinical evaluation as well as a full decision making battery.

Financial and health literacy

Details on financial and health literacy assessment were described previously (24). Financial literacy was assessed via 23 items adapted from the Health and Retirement Study. In brief, 12 items assessed financial and institutional knowledge, 8 items assessed numeracy, and the remaining 3 items assessed the skill that combines both financial knowledge and numeracy in the context of investment returns. The financial literacy score was the percentage of the 23 items that were answered correctly.

Health literacy was assessed via 9 items that measure knowledge of health information and concepts. The questions were tailored to aging population and focused specifically on Medicare, following prescription instruction, flu vaccination, leading causes of heart disease and stroke, and determining drug risk. Similar to financial literacy, the health literacy score was the percentage of the 9 items that were answered correctly. The present study used a composite score to examine the change in financial and health literacy over time, which is the average of financial and health literacy scores (Supplementary Methods). Higher scores indicate higher financial and health literacy.

Financial and health decision making

A 12-item version of the Decision Making Assessment Tool (25) assessed financial and health decision making in older adults, as previously described (26). The instrument is designed to simulate real world situations in choosing mutual funds (financial decision making) and HMO plans (health decision making). Specifically, for financial decision making, tables with information about different mutual funds were presented to the participants, followed by 6 questions that range from simple understanding of the information presented to more challenging problems that require integrating multiple information. The assessment of health decision making follows a similar structure. Tables with information about various HMO plans were presented, and participants were asked 6 questions of varying difficulty level. Each correct answer is scored 1 point, and the number of correct answers was tallied to obtain a total financial and health decision making score. The total score can range between 0 and 12, and higher scores indicate higher financial and health decision making ability.

Scam susceptibility

Scam susceptibility was assessed by averaging participants’ responses to five statements that indicate vulnerability to scams according to findings from the AARP and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Risk Meter (27). Specifically, participants rated, on a 7-point Likert scale, their likelihood of (1) answering and (2) ending a phone call from a stranger/telemarketer; (3) listening to sales pitches from a telemarketer; and whether they agree on the statement that (4) if something sounds too good to be true, it usually is, and (5) older persons are often targeted by scammers. Higher average ratings across the 5 items indicate greater scam susceptibility.

Psychological wellbeing

An 18-item instrument was adapted from Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well Being (28), as previously described (29). Participants rated, on a 7-point Likert scale, their agreement to each item. Six different aspects of psychological wellbeing were assessed, which include self-acceptance, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, positive relations with others, and personal growth. Item-specific ratings were averaged to obtain an overall wellbeing measure, and higher scores indicate higher psychological wellbeing.

Cognition

Cognition was assessed using 19 tests which cover five primary domains of episodic memory, sematic memory, working memory, perceptual speed and visuospatial ability (30, 31). To reduce random variability and potential floor and ceiling artifacts in individual tests, raw scores of each test were first standardized using baseline mean and SD of the MAP cohort, and then averaged across the 19 tests to obtain a global cognitive score. Higher scores indicate higher cognition. Additional information on the cognitive tests, as well as clinical diagnoses of dementia and mild cognitive impairment are provided (Supplementary Materials).

Statistical analysis

To investigate longitudinal change in financial and health literacy, we fit a linear mixed effects model with annual financial and health literacy scores as the longitudinal outcome. Time in years since baseline was the predictor, and the corresponding coefficient estimates the mean annual rate of change in financial and health literacy (i.e. the mean slope). The random slopes from the model estimated the deviation of individual slopes of change from the mean slope. As a result, these random slopes represent adjusted person-specific rates of change in financial and health literacy.

To examine the influence of change in financial and health literacy on the measures of decision making, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing, we fit a series of linear regression models. In these models, the slopes of change in financial and health literacy, estimated using the data from baseline up until the last decision making assessment, was the primary predictor. The measures of financial and health decision making, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing at the last assessment were the continuous outcomes. Each outcome was modelled separately. All the regression models were controlled for age, sex, education, income, as well as the baseline level of financial and health literacy. For ease of comparison, the magnitude of the association was contextualized as the difference in SD of an outcome measure with every 1SD increase or decrease of a predictor.

Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS software 9.4 on the Linux platform. As the analyses involve 3 primary outcomes, statistical significance for the primary analyses was determined at α level of 0.015 after correction for multiple testing.

RESULTS

Financial and health literacy declines in old age

Characteristics of the study participants are described (Table 1). At baseline, approximately 70% of the financial and health questions were answered correctly on average. We examined the longitudinal trajectory of financial and health literacy using annual literacy scores from baseline up until the last assessment. Consistent with previous reports (32, 33), we observed a decline in financial and health literacy over time. On average, the financial and health literacy score dropped about 1 percentage point each year (Mean slope estimate: −0.82, Standard error [SE]: 0.07, t1045: −12.03, p&lt;.001). Notably, the model revealed substantial person-to-person variation in decline (Random slopes variance: 1.70, SE: 0.20, Z: 8.55, p&lt;.001). It is evident from the data that, while most participants (N=873, 83.5%) experienced decline in financial and health literacy, others (N=173, 16.5%) managed to maintain their literacy level during the follow-up (Figure 1).

Older participants (Spearman r: −0.37, N=1,046, p&lt;.001) with lower income (Spearman r: 0.23, N=1,009, p&lt;.001) or fewer years of education (Spearman r: 0.24, N=1,046, p&lt;.001) showed faster decline in financial and health literacy. Female participants declined faster than male participants (t456.6: −4.89, p&lt;.001), as did participants with mild cognitive impairment at baseline (t535.2: −11.02, p&lt;.001).

Declining financial and health literacy and decision making performance

To examine the association of declining literacy with financial and health decision making, we regressed the total decision making scores on the slopes of preceding change in the financial and health literacy score. In the model adjusted for demographics (i.e. age, sex, education, and income), lower baseline level of financial and health literacy was associated with poorer decision making years later (Table 2). In the same model, faster decline in financial and health literacy was also associated with poorer decision making. Specifically, with 1SD of additional decline in the financial and health literacy score, the decision making score was 0.33SD lower (Figure 2A). By comparison, 1SD lower in the baseline level of financial and health literacy score (i.e. approximate 14 percentage points) corresponds to 0.21SD lower in the decision making score; and 1SD of additional years of age (i.e. approximate 7 years) corresponds to 0.24SD lower in the decision making score. Together, these results suggest that the strength of association of declining literacy with the subsequent level of decision making is stronger than baseline literacy or even age. The domain-specific results were similar (Supplementary Results).

Cognitive health is strongly associated with both financial and health literacy as well as decision making (34–37). Thus, to assess whether the association of declining literacy and decision making is robust against traditionally measured cognition, we augmented the regression model by further controlling for the global cognitive score derived from 19 cognitive tests. As expected, higher global cognitive score was associated with higher decision making score. Importantly, however, the association of declining literacy with decision making persisted even after controlling for cognition, suggesting that the impact of declining literacy is relatively independent of cognition (Table 2).

Declining financial and health literacy and scam susceptibility

Next, we examined declining financial and health literacy in association with scam susceptibility. Multivariable regression analysis suggested that participants with lower baseline level of financial and health literacy and separately faster decline in literacy were more susceptible to scams (Table 3). With 1SD of additional decline in the financial and health literacy score, the scam susceptibility score was 0.34SD higher (Figure 2B). By contrast, the strength of association for baseline literacy level was approximately half of that for declining literacy, such that 1SD lower in the baseline literacy score corresponds to 0.17SD higher in the scam susceptibility score, again suggesting that the association was stronger for declining literacy than level.

Similar to the result for financial and health decision making, the association of declining literacy with scam susceptibility persisted after the model was controlled for cognition. Further, during the annual follow-ups into the decision making substudy, approximately 13% of the participants had developed dementia. To account for potential recall bias in the scam susceptibility measure among the demented people, we reanalyzed the data by restricting to participants who were free of dementia throughout the study period. In this subsample (N=906), declining literacy remained associated with greater scam susceptibility (B: −0.341, SE: 0.039, t862: −8.86, p&lt;.001).

Declining financial and health literacy and psychological wellbeing

Finally, we examined the association of declining financial and health literacy with psychological wellbeing. After controlling for demographics, we did not observe an association of baseline literacy level with psychological wellbeing; however, participants with faster decline in financial and health literacy exhibited lower psychological wellbeing (Table 4). With 1SD of additional decline in the literacy score, the overall psychological wellbeing score was 0.19SD lower (Figure 2C). In a model that was further controlled for the global cognitive score, the regression coefficient for declining literacy was attenuated by approximately a half but remained nominally significant. A similar association was observed in the subset of participants who had not developed dementia since the decision making baseline (B: 0.088, SE: 0.029, t863: 3.02, p=.003). Separate analysis on each of the 6 domains of psychological wellbeing suggested that declining literacy was strongly associated with all domains except purpose in life (Supplementary Results).

CONCLUSIONS

Financial and health literacy is an important determinant of independence and wellbeing across the lifespan but is particularly critical in old age. Cross-sectional studies have reported associations of financial and health literacy with cognition, disability, mental health (15), as well as decision making ability (24, 38). Financial and health literacy is also an important correlate of scam susceptibility (12). Of note, these studies have not examined the degree to which declining literacy may have longer term impacts on these outcomes. In the present study, we first demonstrated that financial and health literacy declines over time among community-dwelling older adults. Second, we presented for the first time evidence that declining financial and health literacy is associated with subsequent decision making performance, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing. These new findings extend prior research on the impact of financial and health literacy in several important ways.

First, our finding greatly extends a very limited literature on change in financial and health literacy in old age. It is hypothesized that domain-specific literacy may improve with educational programs or decline with progression of age-related pathologic processes (39). Yet prior evidence of change in literacy relies heavily on either cross-sectional data on persons of different age groups or differences in performance between only two time points (2, 18). Repeated measures of financial and health literacy assessment on the same individuals are required to robustly estimate longitudinal change in financial and health literacy and document whether there is truly an age-related decline in literacy. The present study leveraged data from over 1,000 older residents with up to 11 (and a mean of 5) annual literacy assessments. Two patterns of change emerged. An average older person declined 1 percentage point a year in the total literacy score, and this result depicts a general trend of decline in financial and health literacy among community-living older adults. Separately, the rate of change varied substantially from person to person. Not everyone experienced declining financial and health literacy and a small proportion were able to maintain their literacy level over the course of follow-ups. Older age, female, lower income, fewer years of education and impaired cognition at baseline were correlated with faster decline in financial and health literacy. These results are consistent with a previous report from a smaller sample with less follow-ups (32). Future studies are needed to identify modifiable determinants of declining financial and health literacy.

Second, the present study expands prior work on the impact of domain-specific literacy to include a critically important mental health outcome, psychological wellbeing. Wellbeing is a multidimensional construct that refers to the sense that one is striving, emotionally connected and balanced, and generally functioning well mentally. Wellbeing is related to multiple psychological and health outcomes in old age yet has not been a focus of literacy studies (40). Here, we showed that declining literacy is not only related to lower wellbeing in general, but specifically the tendency to have lower self-acceptance, lack of self-determination, feeling easily overwhelmed, having difficulty maintaining positive relationships, and limited focus on personal growth. This greatly expands our understanding of the health consequences of declining literacy and suggests that it affects domains of functioning not previously considered. Older adults already face many challenges to their psychological health (e.g., disease-related, loss of friends and family), and we show that declining literacy presents an additional source of distress. Fortunately, unlike many other challenges, literacy is modifiable. Thus, efforts to prevent or reduce declining literacy in old age may confer meaningful psychological benefit.

Third, this study disentangles the influence of longitudinal decline in financial and health literacy from that of starting level of literacy. While cross-sectional data are crucial in evaluating the impact of financial and health literacy on important outcomes, an important limitation is that the level and change are confounded. Financial and health literacy is strongly influenced by life experience factors such as education, occupation and contextual factors like systemic racism and sexism, and these factors greatly influence the level of performance at a single point in time. Thus, the wide individual differences observed in financial and health literacy could simply be reflective of a longstanding and preexisting discrepancy between different demographics, rather than an age-related deterioration. However, with aging, human beings are increasingly exposed to various diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and stroke) that degrade many functional abilities including financial and health literacy. Of note, the capacity for tolerating these disease insults differs between persons. Varying abilities of tolerating disease pathology may result in person-specific rates of decline in literacy and further contribute to individual differences in financial and health literacy in late life. Indeed, our results show that the association of declining financial and health literacy with subsequent outcomes was above and beyond the starting level of literacy. More importantly, judging by the regression coefficients, the strength of associations with all three outcomes (i.e. financial and health decision making, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing) are stronger for decline than level, suggesting that it is actually the aging-related decline in literacy that has the most potent impact on key outcomes. These results highlight the importance of capturing and possibly reversing age-related decline in financial and health literacy.

Inadequate financial and health literacy in old age presents a formidable economic and public health challenge. Boomers are the most vulnerable age group that can suffer from unrecoverable financial loss and severe health consequences due to poor literacy and decision making. While possessing the vast majority of financial resources, older adults unfortunately lack the flexibility to bounce back from financial setbacks and are least protected by financial regulations (17). Various diseases common in old age impair cognitive and physical functions and further worsen the situation health-wise. By showing that declining financial and health literacy impacts a variety of adverse outcomes, yet that decline is not ubiquitous and potentially preventable or reversible, the present study has several important real-world implications. First, it demonstrates that the impact of financial and health literacy is not confined to the starting level accumulated throughout the life-span; rather, change in literacy over time is a more important determinant of decision making and other wellbeing outcomes in old age. Second, the associations of declining literacy persisted even after controlling for cognition, which supports the concept that domain-specific literacy is a higher order brain function distinct from memory or other traditionally measured cognitive abilities. In this context, declining financial and health literacy may represent a novel harbinger of adverse outcomes, and regular monitoring of financial and health literacy could serve as a useful tool to identify individuals at risk of impending impairment in decision making and other abilities. The result further suggests that interventions aimed to maintain or improve literacy may be beneficial for behavioral economic and psychological outcomes regardless of individuals’ level of cognitive performance. Third, the present study highlights the potential of health and financial literacy as a primary target of prevention against poor decision making or loss of overall wellbeing, both of which have critical adverse effects.

The present study underscores the critical need for efforts to maintain or even improve financial and health literacy among older persons. Evidence suggests that educational programs (e.g. eHealth literacy intervention) that are designed to boost understanding of financial and healthcare concepts are well received by recipients and have positive effects on real-life financial and healthcare actions taken by older adults (41). Importantly, our findings suggest that the benefits of such interventions also may extend to the psychological domain. Thus, targeted efforts to increase both the availability and usability of literacy interventions for older adults hold the potential to offer considerable public health benefit and should be prioritized.

Strengths and limitations are discussed. By embedding annual decision making assessments into an ongoing epidemiologic cohort study of well-characterized community-dwelling older persons that has a high rate of follow-up, it allows us to robustly estimate the longitudinal change in financial and health literacy. The analytic approach specifically targets the rate of change in financial and health literacy that precedes the outcomes of interest. This temporal relationship between the predictor and the outcomes facilitates the investigation on the consequences of declining literacy. The instruments used for testing financial and health literacy, decision making, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing have been validated in various publications. Limitations include that MAP is a voluntary cohort which limits the generalizability of our findings. Over 90 percent of the participants in the present study are non-Latino whites. Annual decision making assessments have been expanded to a separate cohort of older African Americans in 2017. As data mature, we will be able to examine whether the same associations can be replicated in the minority population.

Figure 1 illustrates the longitudinal profiles of change in financial and health literacy for 100 (approximate 10%) older adults randomly selected from our study sample. The left panel is a spaghetti plot that shows the actual data, where each wiggly line traces annual total literacy scores (y-axis) observed over the years since baseline (x-axis) for a particular participant. For this same group of participants, the right panel shows individual slopes of change in total literacy scores (gray) as well as the mean slope (black), estimated from a linear mixed effects model. Figure 1 reveals two key features of change in financial and health literacy. A negative mean slope suggests that on average literacy declines over time in old age. The difference in person-specific slopes suggests that rates of change vary and decline is not inevitable. Some older adults show faster decline, some slower decline, while a small proportion managed to maintain their literacy level over the years.

Figure 2 illustrates the associations of declining financial and health literacy with financial and health decision making, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing, after controlling for demographics and the baseline literacy level. Each panel is a partial residual plot with corresponding regression line and 95% confidence band. Blue circles are adjusted person-specific slopes of change in the total literacy score plotted against total decision making score (A), scam susceptibility rating (B) and overall psychological wellbeing score (C). The covariates of age, sex, education, income and the baseline total literacy score are regressed out.

Cognitive score is the average of individual scores for 19 cognitive tests after standardization. A score of 0 represents the mean baseline cognition of the cohort, and each unit approximates 1 standard deviation of the baseline cognition of the cohort.

Mild cognitive impairment: each participant underwent annual clinical evaluations including detailed cognitive assessments and neurologic examinations. A diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is rendered if a person has cognitive impairment as determined by neuropsychological testing but does not meet the criteria for dementia diagnosis by the clinician.

Highlights

What is the primary question addressed by this study?

How financial and health literacy decline over time in old age, and what is the relationship of declining literacy with subsequent decision making performance, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing?

What is the main finding of this study?

Most community-dwelling older adults experienced decline in financial and health literacy over time, but the decline is not inevitable. Faster decline in literacy was associated with poorer decision making, greater scam susceptibility and lower psychological wellbeing, above and beyond the starting level of literacy.

What is the meaning of the finding?

Efforts to mitigate declining financial and health literacy may promote independence and wellbeing in old age.
