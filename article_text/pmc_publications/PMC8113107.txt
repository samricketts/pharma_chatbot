Introduction:

A variety of transgenic and knock-in mice that express mutant alleles of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been used to model the effects of amyloid-beta (Aβ) on circuit function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however phenotypes described in these mice may be affected by expression of mutant APP or proteolytic cleavage products independent of Aβ. In addition, the effects of mutant APP expression are attributed to elevated expression of the amyloidogenic, 42-amino acid-long species of Aβ (Aβ42) associated with amyloid plaque accumulation in AD, though elevated concentrations of Aβ40, an Aβ species produced with normal synaptic activity, may also affect neural function.

Methods:

To explore the effects of elevated expression of Aβ on synaptic function in vivo, we assessed visual system plasticity in transgenic mice that express and secrete Aβ throughout the brain in the absence of APP overexpression. Transgenic mice that express either Aβ40 or Aβ42 were assayed for their ability to appropriately demonstrate ocular dominance plasticity following monocular deprivation.

Results:

Using two complementary approaches to measure the plastic response to monocular deprivation, we find that male and female mice that express either 40- or 42-amino acid–long Aβ species demonstrate a plasticity defect comparable to that elicited in transgenic mice that express mutant alleles of APP and Presenilin 1 (APP/PS1 mice).

Conclusions:

These data support the hypothesis that mutant APP-driven plasticity impairment in mouse models of AD is mediated by production and accumulation of Aβ. Moreover, these findings suggest that soluble species of Aβ are capable of modulating synaptic plasticity, likely independent of any aggregation. These findings may have implications for the role of soluble species of Aβ in both development and disease settings.

1. Introduction

A characteristic pathologic finding in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in amyloid plaques. A causative role for this pathology in the cognitive impairment of AD is supported by its presence in early onset forms of the disease caused by genetic alterations that increase expression of APP or its processing to form Aβ (Bentahir et al., 2006; Goate et al., 1991; Kumar-Singh et al., 2006; Nilsberth et al., 2001; Prasher et al., 1998; Rovelet-Lecrux et al., 2006; Tanzi et al., 1987). A large number of mouse models that overexpress mutant alleles of APP with or without mutant alleles of PSEN1 develop amyloid plaques and demonstrate cognitive defects (reviewed by Webster et al., 2014). In vitro models support a role for soluble Aβ species in altering synaptic physiology and causing plasticity impairment (Hartley et al., 1999; Puzzo and Arancio, 2006; Shankar et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004), and in vivo models also demonstrate learning deficits in advance of plaque accumulation (D’Amelio et al., 2011; Hsia et al., 1999; Oddo et al., 2003; Richardson et al., 2003). Mice expressing mutant alleles of APP and PS1 demonstrate a defect in basic visual system plasticity at one-month of age, further supporting the hypothesis that soluble Aβ species disrupt circuit plasticity in vivo (William et al., 2012).

One complication in interpreting plasticity phenotypes in APP-expressing AD models is the possibility that overexpression of mutant APP or APP cleavage products aside from Aβ may contribute to or cause synaptic dysfunction in these mice. The extracellular domain of APP has been implicated in synaptic pruning via interaction with Death Receptor 6 (Nikolaev et al., 2009; Olsen et al., 2014). The beta secretase-cleaved, C-terminal fragment of APP, β-CTF, has been implicated in endosomal compartment dysfunction caused by APP trisomy in Down syndrome model mice (Choi et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2010). The gamma secretase-cleaved intracellular domain of APP, AICD, has been implicated in regulation of gene transcription (Cao and Sudhof, 2001; Kimberly et al., 2001). Thus, mutation of or overexpression of APP leads to increased concentrations of Aβ, but not without the expression of a number of potentially active proteins.

The predominant form of Aβ identified in amyloid plaques is a 42 amino acid-long species, termed Aβ42 (Roher et al., 1993). A 40-amino acid long, far less amyloidogenic form is produced normally in the brain and by cells expressing APP in vitro (Haass et al., 1992; Jarrett et al., 1993; Seubert et al., 1992; Shoji et al., 1992). The association between Aβ42 and AD pathology raises the possibility that the longer form of the protein elicits a toxicity not conferred by Aβ40. Alternatively, both species may have similar effects on synaptic function and the functional difference between the two proteins may relate more to the propensity for Aβ42 to aggregate. This question cannot be addressed in APP-expressing mice, which demonstrate elevated expression of both Aβ40 and Aβ42.

To assess the effect on synaptic plasticity of chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of Aβ, we assessed plasticity in transgenic mice (BRI-Aβ42 and BRI-Aβ40 mice) that express Aβ through a heterologous fusion to the transmembrane protein BRI, positioning the coding sequence of Aβ distal to an extracellular proteolytic cleavage site that results in constitutive expression and secretion of Aβ throughout the brain (McGowan et al., 2005). The plasticity paradigm that we employed is ocular dominance plasticity (ODP), a shift in visual cortical responsiveness to loss of input from one eye that results in weakening of responses to deprived eye stimulation and strengthening of responses to nondeprived eye stimulation. We find that mice engineered to express Aβ42 demonstrate a defect in plasticity similar to that present in APP/PS1 mice (William et al., 2012), consistent with the hypothesis that APP overexpression impairs plasticity through production of Aβ. In addition, we find a similar phenotype in mice that express Aβ40, suggesting that elevated expression of either species of Aβ is capable of impairing plasticity. These data support the hypotheses that Aβ mediates synaptic dysfunction secondary to transgenic expression of mutant APP, and that Aβ42 and Aβ40 have similar effects on synaptic plasticity in vivo. Thus, in a physiological setting, overt aggregation of Aβ species is not necessary to confer a marked neurobiological phenotype.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Mice

BRI-Aβ40 (B6.Cg-Tg(Prnp-ITM2B/APP695*40)1Emcg/J) and BRI-Aβ42 (B6;C3-Tg(Prnp-ITM2B/APP695*42)A12Emcg) mice were obtained from the laboratory of Todd Golde. APP/PS1 (B6;C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. Male and female mice were used in all experiments. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with United States National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Massachusetts General Hospital and the New York University School of Medicine.

2.2. Tissue homogenization and Aβ quantitation

Fresh cortex was dissected from harvested brains and homogenized in TBS with protease inhibitor (Roche) using a Teflon homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 260,000 × g at 4°C for 30 minutes and the supernatants were collected for Aβ quantitation. Human/Rat βAmyloid ELISA kits were used to quantify concentrations of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in homogenates (kits 294–64701 and 292–64501, respectively; Wako). Averages of concentrations per group are reported with standard deviations.

2.3. Surgery

Monocular deprivation (MD), via unilateral lid suture, was performed on P27–P29 transgenic and non-transgenic mice. Four days after MD, each mouse then underwent deprived eye enucleation, 12–15 hour light deprivation and a 30-minute period of vision in the home cage for Arc induction, as described in William et al. (2012). For optical imaging studies using a separate cohort of mice, P23–P25 mice underwent reinforced thin skull preparation with steel headpost implantation for head fixation during awake imaging. Reinforced thin skull preparation was performed as described in Drew et al. (2010). Following recovery from surgery and restraint training, mice underwent pre-MD optical imaging and contralateral lid suture (MD) at P27–29. After 6 days, the sutured lid was reopened and post-MD imaging performed. All surgeries and subsequent analyses were performed blind to genotype.

2.4. Arc in situ hybridization and analysis

As described in William et al., 2017 (2017). Briefly, in situ hybridization with an antisense probe to the Arc gene was performed on 10 μm coronal primary visual cortical sections. Stained sections were imaged using bright field microscopy and the region of responsive cortex was subsequently quantified on image analysis. Specifically, signal intensity was quantified linearly across a rectangular region of interest spanning layer 2/3 of the visual cortex ipsilateral to the non-deprived eye, encompassing the full Arc-positive domain. A plot is generated within the region of interest representing the signal intensity along the y-axis, which is perpendicular to the pial surface, for each position along the x-axis across the selected area of cortex. The width of responsive cortex was then defined as the span over which the plotted signal intensity exceeds half maximum. Measurements from individual sections were used in averages across groups and averages are reported with standard deviations. At least 5 sections were included per mouse. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (NIH). Statistical analyses of domain widths were performed using Excel (Microsoft) and Statview (SAS group). Analyses were performed blind to genotype.

2.5. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals

Imaging was performed through a reinforced, thin skull preparation in experimental mice head fixed while positioned above a turntable to allow for walking or running ad libitum during imaging. Autofluorescence produced by 470 nm light was measured through a green/red emission filter (long pass, 500nm cutoff). Images were collected with an exposure time of 450 ms at 2 Hz through a 2x objective (numerical aperture= 0.14) on a BX50 microscope (Olympus) equipped with a cooled CCD camera. Mice were presented with an upward drifting grating (0.03 cycles/degree, 2 Hz) occupying a 16° area of the visual field to the right of the vertical midline, 20° above the horizontal meridian. Stimulus was presented to left or right eye for 5 seconds, followed by 20 seconds of blank screen at mean luminance. Sets of 30 repetitions of stimulus followed by a blank screen are performed in succession to each eye, alternating between the two eyes after each set for a total of 60 repetitions per eye.

Optical imaging analysis.

Visual cortical responses are measured as two changes in autofluorescence that correlate with cortical activity: an initial autofluorescence signal that occurs during visual stimulation that corresponds to flavoprotein oxidation by increased cortical activity (Tohmi et al., 2009) that is then followed by a slower dip in intrinsic light reflectance caused by the hemodynamic response to cortical activity (Schuett et al., 2002). Trial data are averaged for each frame of the set of trials corresponding to stimulation of each eye and the response to a stimulus was computed as the peak of the change in fluorescence (dF/F) between the average of 3 frames recorded during the first 0.5–1.5 seconds following stimulus onset and the average of 20 frames recorded from 9 seconds to 19 seconds following stimulus onset. For presentation of imaging analyses, the signs of the data are inverted to allow larger values to represent stronger signals. Imaging analyses were performed using FIJI software (NIH). For additional description of imaging parameters and analysis, please see William et al (2017). Averages of data across animals are reported with standard error.

3. Results

3.1. Expression of TBS-soluble Aβ in one-month-old transgenic cortex

One month of age is a time point corresponding to a critical period at which the cortex most robustly responds to monocular visual challenge (Gordon and Stryker, 1996). To quantify the amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 produced in the one-month-old cortices of BRI-Aβ42 and BRI-Aβ40 mice, ELISAs were performed. Analysis of TBS-soluble cortical homogenates reveals that both strains of mice demonstrate elevated concentrations of Aβ compared to their nontransgenic litter mates. BRI-Aβ40 mice demonstrate a 4-fold increase in expression of Aβ40 (Table 1; p=2.14 × 10−6; 6 mice per group, t-test) and BRI-Aβ42 mice demonstrate a nearly equivalent 4.6-fold increase in Aβ42 concentration compared to nontransgenic littermates (Table 1; p=1.13 × 10−7, n=6 nontransgenic mice and n=7 BRI-Aβ42 transgenic mice, t-test). BRI-Aβ42 mice also show a 50% increase in Aβ40 expression compared to littermate mice (p=0.0060). By comparison, at this age, APP/PS1 mice have a 2.36-fold higher concentration of Aβ40 than BRI-Aβ40 mice (APP/PS1 cortical [Aβ40], 1.97 ± 0.64 pmol/g, n=3 APP/PS1 mice; compared to BRI-Aβ42 cortex, p= 0.003, t-test) and a similar concentration of Aβ42 to that of BRI-Aβ42 mice (APP/PS1 cortical [Aβ42], 0.430 ± 0.022 pmol/g; compared to BRI-Aβ42 cortex, p=0.09, t-test). Thus, one-month-old BRI-Aβ42 and BRI-Aβ40 mice demonstrate elevated concentrations of cortical, TBS-soluble Aβ.

3.2. Plasticity impairment in Aβ42-expressing transgenic mice

To assess the ability of Aβ42 to impair synaptic function in vivo, BRI-Aβ42 mice underwent OD plasticity testing. The loss of input from one eye typically elicits two changes in cortical responsiveness, an expansion in the area of the visual cortex responsive to the ipsilateral, nondeprived eye, as well as a shift in the magnitude of responses to each eye such that the cortex demonstrates weaker responses to the deprived eye and stronger responses to the nondeprived eye. To measure the width of the visual cortex responsive to stimulation of the nondeprived eye, visual stimulation is used to upregulate expression of the immediate early gene Arc in responsive visual cortical neurons (Figure 1 A–D; Tagawa et al., 2005). In the absence of MD, BRI-Aβ42 transgenic and nontransgenic litter mates demonstrate similar patterns of Arc expression (width of nontransgenic Arc+ domain, 863 ± 70 μm, n=8 mice; width of BRI-Aβ42 Arc+ domain, 883 ± 58 μm, n=8 mice; p= 0.095, t-test; Fig. 1 A, B, and E). Following 4-day MD, a significant expansion in the responsive domain occurs in nontransgenic mice (post-MD nontransgenic Arc+ domain width, 1106 ± 69 μm; compared to unchallenged, p=1.07 × 10−46; Fig. 1A, C, and E). BRI-Aβ42 transgenic mice fail to demonstrate this expansion (post-MD Arc+ domain width, 896 ± 92 μm; compared to unchallenged, p=0.33, t-test; Fig. 1 B–E), consistent with a defect in OD plasticity. A significant interaction is present between genotype and challenge (p&lt;0.001; two-way ANOVA), consistent with a defect in OD plasticity. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals was used to measure cortical responses to presentation of a binocular visual field stimulus to each eye before and after a 6-day period of MD. Prior to MD, nontransgenic and transgenic mice demonstrate similar responses to stimulation of each eye (Fig. 2A; nontransgenic ipsilateral response, dF/F at the peak of signal, 3.8 ± 0.5 × 10−3; BRI-Aβ42 ipsilateral response, 4.5 ± 0.4 × 10−3; p=0.34; nontransgenic contralateral response, 6.2 ± 0.6 × 10−3 ; BRI-Aβ42 ipsilateral response, 5.7 ± 0.6 × 10−3; p=0.34; nontransgenic ODI, 0.24 ± 0.06; BRI-Aβ42 ODI, 0.12 ± 0.04; p=0.1, t-tests). Following MD, nontransgenic mice demonstrate weakening of responses to the deprived eye contralateral to the imaged cortex and strengthening of responses to the ipsilateral, nondeprived eye resulting in a shift in the ocular dominance index (nontransgenic ODI post-MD, −0.21 ± 0.08; p=0.001, paired t-test). BRI-Aβ42 mice demonstrate weakening of responses to the deprived eye similar to nontransgenic mice; however, transgenic mice also show significant weakening of responses to the nondeprived eye (transgenic post-MD ipsilateral response, 3.6 ± 0.1 × 10−3; p=0.046, paired t-test). As a result, the ocular dominance shift that occurs in nontransgenic mice does not occur in BRI-Aβ42 transgenic mice (Fig. 2 B and C; BRI-Aβ42 transgenic ODI post-MD, 0.01 ± 0.05; p=0.07, paired t-test). A significant interaction is present between genotype and the shift in ODI post challenge, consistent with a defect in ODP (p=0.0033, two-way ANOVA). Using two different approaches, BRI-Aβ42 mice demonstrate defects in OD plasticity.

3.3. Plasticity impairment in Aβ40-expressing transgenic mice

The plasticity defect present in mice exposed to elevated concentrations of Aβ42 prompted an analysis of whether similar defects may arise from exposure to elevated concentrations of Aβ40. BRI-Aβ40 transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates demonstrate similar patterns of Arc expression when reared normally (Fig. 3A, B and E; BRI-Aβ40 Arc+ domain width, 877 ± 50 μm; nontransgenic Arc+ domain width, 883 ± 50 μm; p= 0.53, t-test). Following a 4-day period of MD, the expansion in the width of the cortex responsive to the ipsilateral, nondeprived eye that occurs in nontransgenic mice (post-4d MD Arc+ width, 1071 ± 117 μm; compared to unchallenged, p=7.7 × 10−19, t-test) fails to occur in BRI-Aβ40 transgenic mice (Fig. 3D and E; BRI-Aβ40 Arc+ domain width post 4d MD, 897 ± 85 μm; p=0.10, t-test). Comparing the changes that occur following MD in BRI-Aβ40 and nontransgenic mice, a significant interaction is present between transgene expression and challenge (p&lt;0.0001, two-way ANOVA). Baseline responses are similar between BRI-Aβ40 and nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4A nontransgenic ipsilateral response, 4.6 ± 0.4 × 10−3; BRI-Aβ40 ipsilateral response, 4.6 ± 0.4 × 10−3; p=0.96; nontransgenic contralateral response, 6.5 ± 0.5 × 10−3; BRI-Aβ40 ipsilateral response, 6.2 ± 0.6 × 10−3; p=0.71; nontransgenic ODI, 0.16 ± 0.06; BRI-Aβ42 ODI, 0.13 ± 0.08; p=0.76, t-tests). Following a 6-day period of MD, nontransgenic and BRI-Aβ40 transgenic mice demonstrate weakening of responses to deprived eye stimulation (Fig. 4A; nontransgenic contralateral eye response post-MD, 3.8 ± 0.5 × 10−3; p= 0.02, paired t-test, n=6 mice; BRI-Aβ40 contralateral eye response post-MD, 3.66 ± 0.2; p=0.014, paired t-test, n=7).

Significant strengthening of responses to stimulation of the nondeprived eye is observed in nontransgenic mice (ipsilateral response pre-MD, 4.7 ± 0.4 × 10−3; post-MD, 5.7 ± 0.6 × 10−3; p=0.044, paired t-test). In contrast, BRI-Aβ40 transgenic mice demonstrate weakening of responses to the nondeprived eye following MD (ipsilateral response pre-MD, 4.6 ± 0.4 × 10−3; post-MD, 3.2 ± 0.2 × 10−3; p=0.014, paired t-test). Moreover, the shift in ODI that occurs in nontransgenic mice (Fig. 4B and C; ODI pre-MD, 0.16 ± 0.06; post-MD, −0.2 ± 0.07; p=0.017, paired t-test) fails to occur in BRI-Aβ40 transgenic mice (BRI-Aβ40 ODI pre-MD, 0.13 ± 0.08; ODI post-MD, 0.07 ± 0.04; p=0.54, paired t-test; compared to nontransgenic pre- and post-MD data, p=0.024, two-way ANOVA), consistent with a defect in ODP similar to that seen in BRI-Aβ42 mice. These data suggest that chronic increases in the concentration of Aβ40 or Aβ42 are capable of impairing visual cortical circuit plasticity.

4. Discussion

4.1. Visual plasticity defects in Aβ-expressing transgenic mice

Using the visual system as a model circuit, we found cortical plasticity defects in two transgenic models of Aβ exposure. Defects were present in both the areal expansion of the cortex responsive to the nondeprived eye as well as in strengthening of responses to stimulation of the nondeprived eye following MD. These phenotypes are similar to visual system defects observed in APPswe and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (William et al., 2012), suggesting that transgenic expression of Aβ is sufficient to phenocopy the effects of transgenic expression of a mutant allele of APP. Since APPswe mice express a higher percentage of Aβ40, and APP/PS1 mice express a higher percentage of Aβ42, these observations suggest that the developmental plasticity consequences of over-expression of Aβ may not be sensitive to the specific Aβ species. Thus, in addition to confirming the presence of this phenotype in two additional Aβ-expressing transgenic lines, which importantly do not have the potential confounds of APP over-expression, these data support the hypotheses that 1) chronic elevation of Aβ levels can disrupt cortical plasticity in vivo, and 2) that the extent to which the Aβ peptide is aggregation prone (i.e. Aβ 40 vs Aβ 42) does not impact this phenotype.

As a well characterized immediate early gene, Arc has been used as a reporter of neural activity in studies of neuronal activity in various AD mouse models (Dickey et al., 2004; Grinevich et al., 2009; Palop et al., 2005; Wegenast-Braun et al., 2009). While some of these studies report decreased Arc expression at baseline or following a stimulus expected to increase the gene’s expression, increased expression of Arc using a transgenic reporter has also been described. The increases and decreases in expression of the protein in different populations of neurons in different experimental paradigms and in different mutant-APP-expressing mouse models likely reflect differences in the activity of those populations of neurons in each of those contexts, rather than a direct effect of Amyloid-beta exposure on expression of Arc.

Classically thought to be a plastic response restricted to visual cortical neurons, ODP has been demonstrated in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons, many of which weaken responsiveness to the deprived eye and strengthen responses to stimulation of the nondeprived eye (Jaepel et al., 2017). Whether LGN ODP occurs simultaneously with the cortical plastic response or plays a required role in cortical plasticity has not been demonstrated, but the possibility remains that the ODP defects observed in BRI-Aβ mice may be mediated in part by an effect of Aβ on LGN plasticity.

4.2. Weakening of responses to nondeprived eye stimulation following MD in BRI-Aβ mice

In assessing the magnitude of cortical responses before and after MD, we find that BRI-Aβ42 and BRI-Aβ40 mice demonstrate weakening of responses to nondeprived eye input instead of the expected strengthening that we see in nontransgenic mice. These findings are consistent with hippocampal physiologic studies demonstrating a lower threshold for activity-dependent synaptic weakening or long term depression (LTD), in additional to blockade of long term potentiation of synapses (Hartley et al., 1999; Shankar et al., 2008; Walsh et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2004). A lower threshold for induction of LTD has been demonstrated in the APP/PS1 visual cortex (Kim et al., 2013b), suggesting a physiologic correlate for the circuit level plasticity defects that we observe in BRI-Aβ and APP/PS1 mice. To the extent that a loss of input from one eye can model the changes in circuit activity caused by injury, our findings also support the possibility that elevated concentrations of Aβ promote or exacerbate synaptic weakening caused by concomitant pathologies in the aged brain, including vascular disease, infarct, or neurodegenerative pathology.

4.3. Plasticity defects in transgenic mice lacking behavioral impairment at older ages

The deficits in synaptic plasticity we have characterized in one-month-old BRI-Aβ40 and BRI-Aβ42 mice are consistent with basic defects in plasticity caused by elevated exposure of visual circuit neurons to elevated concentrations of Aβ. These transgenic strains have undergone cognitive testing at 12 months of age and were not found to demonstrate significant impairment in behavioral assays that revealed deficits in APP-expressing transgenic mice (Kim et al., 2013a). Assessment of ODP may be a more sensitive assay of abnormalities in synaptic function than behavioral phenotypes mediated by more complex, distributed neural circuits that may be subject to compensatory adaptation over the lives of experimental mice. It is possible that full length mutant APP and other APP cleavage products in addition to Aβ contribute to impairment in APP-expressing models. The β-secretase cleaved transmembrane fragment of APP, β-carboxy terminal fragment (β-CTF) has been proposed to contribute to endosomal compartment dysfunction in Down syndrome (DS; Jiang et al., 2010), raising the possibility that other APP metabolites also contribute to neuronal dysfunction in APP-expressing transgenic mice as well as in DS. The processing of APP to produce Aβ may result in the production of Aβ aggregates with distinct conformations that are more potent disruptors of synaptic function than Aβ produced by BRI-Aβ transgene expression. Soluble monomeric Aβ40 has been demonstrated to disrupt short term plasticity in vitro (Fogel et al., 2014), suggesting that plasticity can be impaired directly by Aβ species. Spatial differences in Aβ concentration may also explain differences in cognitive performance between BRI-Aβ and APP-expressing transgenic mice.

4.4. Effect of Aβ40 expression on circuit plasticity

The phenotypes we observe are present in mice that express either Aβ40 or Aβ42, suggesting that elevated concentrations of either species are capable of disrupting synaptic function. Generation of Aβ40 in the normal brain is regulated by synaptic activity (Brody et al., 2008; Kamenetz et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2011), suggesting that the protein plays a normal role in regulation of synaptic function. A number of studies have provided support for a role for Aβ40 in regulation of presynaptic function and elevations in endogenous mouse Aβ levels have been demonstrated to disrupt short term plasticity via dysregulation of this presynaptic function that requires interaction with full length APP (Abramov et al., 2009; Fogel et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017). Aβ may also interact with a number of receptors capable of transducing postsynaptic signals that promote synaptic weakening (Smith and Strittmatter, 2017).

5. Conclusions

Our data suggest that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are similarly able to modulate synaptic function. Our data suggest that even modest elevations in Aβ concentration are capable of disrupting plasticity in vivo. We speculate that the aggregation of Aβ in AD disrupts a concentration-sensitive, normal function of Aβ. Our data support the hypothesis that a better understanding of the normal function(s) of Aβ in the brain will be critical for the design of targeted therapies to prevent or to ameliorate cognitive impairment in AD patients.
