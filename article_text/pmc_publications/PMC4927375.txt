vascular cognitive impairment

Introduction

Cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions are very common in older people, and accumulate with age. Cerebrovascular lesions can directly reduce cognitive status: vascular dementia is the second most-common cause of clinical dementia after AD. In addition, cerebrovascular lesions worsen the impact of AD and other dementia pathologies, and may contribute to AD aetiology. This spectrum is reflected in the concept of Vascular contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID)1.

There are numerous vascular pathologies underlying VCID2–4. The most prevalent is cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), or arteriolosclerosis, in small arteries (outer diameter up to ~ 200µm) that supply deep nuclei and deep white matter areas in the human brain2, 3, 5, 6. Parenchymal lesions associated with SVD vasculopathy are small focal infarcts (“lacunes”), diffuse white matter lesions (WML), and microhemorrhages3, 4, 6. Other VCID-related vascular pathologies include microatheroma, venous collagenosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)1, 3, 6.

The limitations of animal models for VCID are well-known1, 7, 8. Experimental species differ from humans in terms of lifespan, relative white matter abundance, large artery dimensions (Figure 1) and in size and morphology of deep penetrating arteries (Figure 2). Nevertheless, animal paradigms provide valuable insights into mechanisms, progression and possible therapies in VCID. All experimental use of animals for human health-related research carries ethical responsibilities, and must be governed by internationally-agreed Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines). Here we update a previous systematic review of VCID-relevant models8 (Online Supplement, please see http://stroke.ahajournals.org) and summarize instructive examples (Table 1).

Hypoperfusion: rats and mice

Bilateral surgical ligation of the common carotid arteries (2VO) in rats remains the most frequently-used model8 (see Online Supplement). Bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) in mice, using metal coils to narrow the arteries by 50%, produces a less-severe, chronic global hypoperfusion29, 30. BCAS mice develop some white-matter damage, increased BBB permeability and cognitive impairment29, 31. F18-FDG-PET indicates a decrease in hippocampal glucose utilization 6 months post-BCAS. In the radial maze and Barnes maze tasks, working memory was impaired at 30 days. Impaired reference memory was also detected at 5–6 months post-surgery8, 9.

After six months of stenosis the animals display significantly (30%) reduced fractional anisotropy on diffusion tensor imaging in white matter areas9. Histologically, they exhibit thickened basement membrane collagen IV (relative to one month post-BCAS and sham-operated animals)9 and hippocampal atrophy with pyknotic and apoptotic cells from 6–8 months post-surgery29. An unexpected finding in BCAS mice is the incidence at six months of subcortical haemorrhagic lesions, detected on MRI and confirmed histologically9. The haemorrhagic lesions, and an astroglial response with unusual distribution of aquaporin-4, suggest a pathological process additional to global hypoperfusion9, 30.

In order to produce more gradual CBF reduction, ameroid micro-constrictor cuffs filled with casein (which swells on absorbing water) are placed around the carotid arteries of rats10. In rats gradual bilateral occlusion (2VGO) over 2–3 days leads to comparable CBF reduction and white matter damage, with lower mortality and hippocampal neuronal death, relative to the standard 2VO rat model8, 10. 2VGO in hypertensive (SHR) rats produced a gradual reduction in global CBF (to 68% of baseline values, after 7 days) and cognitive impairment in the Y-maze12. Mice with an ameroid constrictor placed on one common carotid artery and a microcoil causing 50% stenosis on the other (“ACAS” mice) exhibit subcortical infarcts in addition to diffuse white matter damage11. ACAS mice exhibited gradual reduction of CBF over 28 days, and multiple infarct damage in subcortical regions ipsilateral to the ameroid constrictor cuff, observed in 81% of the mice11. At day 28 post-surgery, ACAS mice showed significant decrease in spatial working memory11.

Hypoperfusion: baboons

In adult baboons (Papio anubis; age 12 years or more) occluding one vertebral and both internal carotid arteries (termed three vessel occlusion; 3VO), led to a severe hypoperfusion state13. Activation of microglia was marked at 3 days post-occlusion, and plasma extravasation at 7–14 days, both being resolved by 28 days. From 7 days post-occlusion these animals developed progressive white matter pallor and vacuolation in the corpus callosum, deep subcortical and periventricular white matter areas, with some demyelination, up to sacrifice at 28 days13. While a primate surgical model poses substantial logistic challenges, data from a human-like experimental species with extensive white matter are uniquely valuable7, 32, 33. For VCID-relevant research, it is notable that ageing baboons exhibit both β-amyloid and tau neuropathology.

Hypoperfusion paradigms in relation to clinical SVD and VCID

Regional CBF in white-matter is universally low across species (figure 1). This is generally considered to explain the white matter predilection for diffuse hypoperfusion lesions. In human brain the deep subcortical white matter is supplied by the distal fields of deep penetrating medullary arteries (length 50 mm or more) arising from the leptomeningeal branches of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Thus, even under normal circumstances this deep white matter is subject to relatively low perfusion pressure. Though there are some anastomoses between these vessels34, an episode of profound global hypoperfusion (eg. acute ICA occlusion) causes white matter infarcts in a characteristic deep or internal borderzone distribution35. Experimental induction of abnormally-low perfusion pressure in an animal (e.g. 2VO or 3VO models) would be expected to cause ischaemic white matter damage with a similar pattern.

A caveat is that pathogenesis of WML in these hypoperfusion models is very different from human SVD. The majority of WML and lacunes in humans are thought to arise as a direct result of local small vessel wall changes3 not from embolic events or episodes of global hypoperfusion. Hence, while experimental proximal large vessel occlusion will cause white matter changes, the distribution of lesions is likely to be more confined and stereotyped, and other features contributing to the local milieu in chronic hypertensive arteriopathy, such as blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, are likely to be different in such models, or absent. Further, any vascular adaptions such as ischaemic preconditioning36 are unlikely, except where occlusion is more gradual (e.g. 2VGO).

Hypertensive rodents with co-morbidities

Spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats (SHRSP) develop severe hypertension from 9–12 weeks of age and typically exhibit stroke lesions at 9–12 months, with 90% mortality by 12 months of age8. Stroke lesions are frequently haemorrhagic in nature and are unpredictable in timing, severity, location and behavioural outcome. In the absence of co-morbidities, stroke-free SHRSP exhibit little white matter change on MRI or histologically14, 37, 38. In SHRSP subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCCAo), then a combination of low-protein, high salt diet (so-called “Japanese permissive diet”, JPD) and NaCl (1%w/v)-supplemented drinking water, diffuse WML were seen on MRI14. These were accompanied by impaired performance in the Morris water maze (MWM). Histologically there was loss of myelin, signs of inflammatory response and matrix metalloproteinase-mediated BBB disruption14. While mature oligodendrocytes were depleted in white matter of SHRSP, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells paradoxically increased in density14, 37. The WML were accompanied by hypoperfusion, determined by arterial spin labelling MRI, and reduced brain tissue pO2 measured by electron paramagnetic resonance15. Hypoxia-induced HIF-1, activating MMP-2, may be the pathway for BBB disruption. The antibiotic minocycline has both anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activity. Young SHRSP were treated with this drug (50mg/kg ip, every 2 days) for 9 weeks, following the UCCAo surgery and transfer to JPD. Minocycline-treated animals showed an impressive protection from WML on MRI, modest improvement in the MWM, and increased lifespan, relative to vehicle-treated animals16.

While SHRSP develop severe hypertension, milder chronic hypertension is induced by supplementing drinking water with the NOS-inhibitor L-NAME39, or chronic infusion of angiotensin II by minipump40. Mice receiving a “sub-pressor” infusion of angiotensin II develop mild hypertension (MABP 90 mmHg, relative to 70 mmHg in saline-infused controls)40. In addition to vascular actions, sub-pressor concentrations of the hypertensive agent may have direct effects on neural organization and metabolism.

Hyperhomocysteinemia in mice and rats

Elevated plasma concentration of the non-essential amino acid homocysteine, termed hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCy), is a risk factor for VCID41. In wildtype mice a diet deficient in three B-vitamins (B6, B9-folate and B12) resulted in HHCy within 10 weeks, accompanied by reduced capillary density in brain tissue and impaired performance in MWM17. The same dietary regime also exacerbated cognitive impairment in APP transgenic mice18.

Maintaining wildtype mice for 12 weeks on a diet enriched for the HCy precursor methionine, in addition to B6/B9/B12-defficiency, resulted in plasma [homocysteine] in the range 70–90 µmol/l19 classified as “moderate” HHCy in mice19, 41 (physiological range for plasma [homocysteine] in healthy mice and humans: 5–10 µmol/l). These mice exhibited cognitive impairment on the two-day radial arm water maze, increased metalloproteinase (MMP2, MMP9) activity in brain tissue and small focal cerebral haemorrhages19. The methionine-enriched, B6/B9/B12-defficient diet was also applied to dual mutant APP/PS1 mice20. In these animals, cerebral microhemorrhages (evident on MRI and histology) were accompanied by redistribution of β-amyloid deposits from brain parenchyma to the microvasculature20.

In rats B9-folate deficiency alone was sufficient to induce HHCy and cognitive impairment, and to reduce cerebral blood volume and reactivity measured by absolute, non-invasive near infra-red spectroscopy42. While the molecular mechanism of HHCy-induced VCID is unclear, the locus of pathology appears to be vascular rather than neuronal41.

Animal models of Blood-brain barrier dysfunction

Pdgfr−/− mice deficient in pericytes, the contractile cells that ensheath capillary vessels, showed progressive BBB breakdown from one month of age, with increasing extravasation of plasma proteins in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. This was accompanied by reduced capillary density and age-dependent reduction in baseline CBF and response to a vasogenic stimulus (whisker twitch)43. By 16 months of age the mice exhibited pronounced neuronal loss within the hippocampus, accompanied by impaired performance in a simple assay of learning (novel object recognition task)43.

APOE genotype is a risk factor for sporadic AD. The APOE ε4 allele increases risk, possibly via a toxic effect of the APOE ε4 gene product, or via loss of physiological APOE function. In an elegant series of target replacement (TR) studies, mice lacking native ApoE expressed the human alleles APOE 2, 3 or 4, under an astrocyte-specific promoter. TR mice carrying only the APOE ε4 allele (like ApoE−/− null mice) exhibited enhanced BBB permeability that was evident by two weeks of postnatal age25, 26. This was dependent on MMP9 activity, induced via the pro-inflammatory cytokine cyclophilin-A25. None of these changes was evident in APOE2 or APOE3 TR mice. APOE4 TR mice exhibited worse spatial memory relative to age-matched APOE3 TR animals at older ages (12, 24 months) but also in young adulthood (3 months)27, 28.

Regional CBF was much reduced in the APOE4 TR or ApoE−/− null animals at 9 months of age. CBF could be restored and was at normal levels in double knockout animals, lacking ApoE as well as the gene for cyclophilin-A25. These well-defined transgenic animal systems allow specific biochemical pathways to be explored. The gene product of APOE3 binds to the membrane transporter LRP1, and this supresses the harmful effects of cyclophilin-A on MMP9 activation and BBB breach25. These experiments also suggest that the harmful effect of APOE4 is loss of function, rather than a toxic action of the APOE4 gene product. A functional APOE and LRP1 transport system stimulates clearance of amyloid peptides and possibly other brain parenchymal debris. Further, when APOE4 TR mice are crossed to the APP transgenic mouse models of amyloid deposition, CAA is significantly increased, suggesting a potential role for ApoE4 in the vascular accumulation of amyloid44.

Another molecular participant in β-amyloid clearance from brain tissue is PICALM, a phosphoinositide binding protein associated with clathrin that is required for endocytosis and internalisation of cell surface receptors. PICALM interacts with endothelial LRP1 to mediate β-amyloid clearance from brain tissue45. Heterozygous Picalm+/− mice, expressing sub-physiological levels of PICALM protein in brain endothelium, exhibited increased β-amyloid neuropathology and some cognitive impairment, assessed with measures of nest-building and burrowing45. PICALM has emerged as a candidate in genome wide association studies (GWAS) for AD, suggesting a key role in the pathogenesis of AD and dementia46.

CADASIL and CARASIL mice

CADASIL and CARASIL are rare monogenic forms of SVD, leading to early-onset VCID. In CADASIL the underlying gene is NOTCH3 and in CARASIL the gene is HTRA1.

Notch3R169C transgenic mice have 4-fold overexpression of CADASIL-associated mutant Notch3. These mice exhibit defective CBF reactivity from 5 months of age, reduced CBF from 12 months and progressive WML from 18 months21. The main WML were microvacuoles within the myelin sheath, suggested to reflect defective ion-water homeostasis24. There was no apparent loss of oligodendrocyte density and axons were intact24. The extracellular matrix proteins vitronectin and TIMP-3 accumulated in the vascular GOM deposits that are characteristic of CADASIL. Double-transgenic mice that express CADASIL-causing Notch3 mutations, in addition to being heterozygous null for vitronectin, exhibit rescue from WML at 12 to 20 months of age, but not rescue of impaired CBF. Stroke lesions have not been reported for these mice (up to age 24 months). Another transgenic strain has recently been reported22, carrying the human genomic NOTCH3 sequence. Knock-in Notch3Arg170Cys mouse models, with a mutation in the endogenous Notch3 gene23, developed a CADASIL-like vessel pathology and, in addition, some incidence of parenchymal lesions (from 20 months of age)23. Micro-infarcts, micro-haemorrhages and behavioural motor deficits were seen in a minority (up to 12%) of these mutant mice up to age 13 months23.

HTRA1 encodes a secreted serine protease that is involved in TGFβ signalling. CARASIL-causing mutations result in loss of HtrA1 activity. Brain tissue from Htra1−/− null mice, and fibroblasts from CARASIL patients, exhibited reduced TGFβ signalling and dysregulation of an extracellular TGFβ-binding protein (LTPB-1) that is a novel HtrA1 target47. In brain tissue from Htra1 null mice, LTBP1 levels were augmented and TGFβ signalling depressed47.

Discussion

Co-morbid models

Greater understanding of interactions between risk factors, genotype and specific vascular lesions (Figure 3) may come from animals with multiple pathologies and/or co-morbidities. Examples are hypertensive rats with JPD diet and brain hypoperfusion14, 16, or diet-induced HHCy combined with AD pathology20. In AD molecular understanding is more advanced than in VCID and transgenic AD models are well-established. VCID-AD overlap and interaction may therefore be explored using vascular challenges combined with brain-injected Aβ peptides48 or in APP transgenic animals30.

Larger Species

Larger animals (primates, dogs, sheep, swine) have longer natural life span than rodents, and offer valuable data relevant to the human brain gyrencephalic anatomy, abundant white-matter and arterial morphology (Figure 2), even though cohort sizes may necessarily be limited13, 33. They can be subjected to VCID-relevant risk factors (old age, hypertension, high-fat diet, physical exercise status). Rhesus macaques 20–30 years of age are considered analogous to older people 60–90 years of age33. Quantitative MRI of these animals shows a highly significant reduction in white matter volume with increasing age33. In old dogs a cognitive dysfunction syndrome, featuring some aspects of VCID, has been described49. Experimental sheep models have recently been developed to simulate acute ischemic stroke50, 51. Sophisticated cognitive testing paradigms are available for primates32, 52. By contrast, cognitive paradigms for large domestic species are currently rudimentary53, 54.

A very small species: Zebrafish

Perturbation of FOXC1 (which encodes a forkhead-like transcription factor) in Danio rerio led to cerebral haemorrhages55. FOXC1. GWAS studies suggested possible linkage of the FOXC1 locus with SVD phenotype (white matter hyperintensities). Suppression of FOXC1 also affected PDGF signalling and CNS development55. The zebrafish offers a rapid screening platform for genetic alterations.

Summary

Animal models have great potential to increase our understanding of specific vessel pathologies, how these cause parenchymal lesions, how known risk factors influence vessel and parenchymal changes, and the mechanisms that link them all to VCID (Figure 3).

For example, transgenic animals permit well-controlled testing of molecular hypotheses regarding a functional pathway, such as ApoE-mediated clearance25, 26, 43, 45. “CADASIL mice” carrying Notch3 mutations combine a known molecular cause with biologically-appropriate vessel pathology and parenchymal lesions reminiscent of human SVD21–24. The risk factor HHCy is induced by dietary manipulation in rodents, which exhibit vessel fibrosis, microhaemorrhages and cognitive deficits17–20. HHCy mice and rats offer a valuable platform for identifying the currently-unknown molecular targets of HHCy-related brain disease41. Diffuse WML can be induced in rodents following chronic hypoperfusion9–12 and also in SHRSP with dietary and surgical co-morbidities14, 16, in both conditions with some concomitant cognitive deficit. As noted, the vascular pathology in these animals is likely to differ from human VCID (Figure 3).

There are several directions for future progress. In our view experimental species with closer metabolic and immunological similarity to humans (primates, larger domestic species) will make pre-clinical testing of interventions more translational. Given the multi-factorial nature of the VCID spectrum, co-morbid animals may also accelerate discovery biology for VCID treatments. While the models discussed here clearly do not reflect the full pathogenic pathway of human disease (Figure 3) they represent a pragmatic test-bed for interventions11, 12, 16. VCID is a broad concept1, and there is no one “optimal VCID model”. We hope that this review will assist selection of experimental models most relevant to the aspect of VCID under study.

Numerous risk factors, some of which are listed, impact on vessel and parenchymal changes, and also on the mechanisms that link these to each other and to VCID. In addition, rare monogenic mutations are causal, including NOTCH3, HTRA1 and COL4A1/COL4A2 (the genes encoding collagen-α1IV and collagen-α2IV).
