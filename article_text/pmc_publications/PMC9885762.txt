Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) poses substantial health challenges among an aging population. One of the primary challenges in studying ADRD is that biological processes underlying these ailments begin decades prior to diagnosis. Previous studies indicate a relationship between ADRD and air pollution exposure to both fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) but are limited in their interpretation because they consider exposure measurements at a single time point. Our retrospective cohort study considered 27 + million Medicare enrollees in the United States followed up to 17 years and matched with highly accurate annual air pollution exposure measurements for PM2.5, NO2, and summer ozone. We applied distributed lag models and estimated the lagged associations between air pollution and odds of first hospitalization with ADRD. We found significantly increased odds due to overall PM2.5 and NO2 exposure and time-lagged exposure 10 and 8 years prior to admission, respectively. Furthermore, we found the connection between air pollution exposure and increased odds of first hospitalization with ADRD exists at air pollution levels below current National Ambient Air Quality Standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency, with the steepest increase in odds occurring at low concentrations of PM2.5. Our findings are the first to show that air pollution exposures from as many as 10 years prior to the admission are related to increased odds of hospitalizations with ADRD. As there are no clear treatments available for ADRD, identifying modifiable risk factors such as air pollution exposure may make significant contributions towards prevention or delayed disease progression.


pmc1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) encompass a range of neurodegenerative diseases that pose substantial health challenges among an aging population. In 2010, nearly 5 million individuals aged 65 + in the United States were diagnosed with ADRD and this number is expected to triple by 2050 (Hebert et al., 2013). One of the primary challenges in studying ADRD is that biological processes underlying these ailments likely begin decades prior to diagnosis (Sperling et al., 2011). Because early disease diagnosis and treatment has not yet reached maturity, identifying early modifiable risk factors including exposure to air pollution, may provide a path towards prevention or delay of disease progression.

There are several plausible biological mechanisms connecting air pollution exposure with the development or expedited onset of neurological diseases. The pathway begins with pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which when inhaled can enter the bloodstream and cross the blood–brain barrier (Power et al., 2016); here, PM2.5 has been shown to interact with the central nervous system creating reactive oxidative species and inflammation (Riva et al., 2011; Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2004). Similarly, ultrafine particles, often associated with traffic related pollution, can directly translocate to the brain through the olfactory bulb inducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, which have been shown to play a role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Zhu et al., 2004; Schwartz and Deczkowska, 2016; Oberdörster et al., 2004; Li et al., 2003). Both human and animal studies have shown that air pollution leads to atherosclerosis, elevated blood inflammatory biomarkers, and oxidative stress, which may accelerate hospital admission for several neurological diseases (Jayaraj et al., 2017; Araujo et al., 2008). Importantly, and in line with our study, biomarkers for dementia-related cognitive decline are detectable decades prior to diagnosis, which provides biological plausibility for setting a decade-long relevant exposure period of study (Power et al., 2016; Jack et al., 2013).

Epidemiological studies have previously explored the relationship between air pollution and ADRD. There is evidence that PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure is associated with an increased risk of first ADRD hospital admission (Shi et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021). Traffic related air pollution has also been linked to dementia incidence (Oudin et al., 2016). A meta-analysis identified 66 related papers and found substantial evidence between increased PM2.5 exposure and cognitive decline, but inconclusive evidence for other pollutants such as PM10, NO2, and nitrogen oxides (Weuve et al., 2021). The aforementioned studies indicate relationships between air pollution exposure and ADRD, but are limited in interpretation because they consider exposure measurements at a single time point against a disease that develops over decades. Whether long-term exposure to increased air pollution accelerates the time between early biological indicators and later physiological symptoms of ADRD is an open question.

In this paper we applied distributed lag models (DLMs) to incorporate the assumption that exposure effects are distributed across an extended period of time (Schwartz et al., 2000). In contrast to using a single time-point estimate of exposure, the DLM utilizes repeated measurements of exposure over time to determine periods of susceptibility to air pollution exposure. In addition, the DLM allows for linear (Zanobetti et al., 2000) or nonlinear (Gasparrini et al., 2010; Mork and Wilson, 2022), exposure–response functions at each time point. The resulting distributed lag estimates help us understand and quantify the immediate, delayed, and overall burden of air pollution exposure on pressing issues in public health.

Our work aims to rectify the omission of time-lagged exposure effects that coincide with the multi-year time-period from initial biological markers of ADRD to moderate or severe disease. We leverage a national longitudinal cohort of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) beneficiaries continuously enrolled in year 2000 and followed for up to 17 years. In addition, we match highly accurate air pollution exposure predictions for PM2.5, NO2, and summer ozone at each individual’s ZIP-code of residence, updated annually (Di et al., 2019; Requia et al., 2020; Di et al., 2020). Our analysis then estimates the time-lagged relationships between each pollutant and odds of first hospitalization with ADRD and identifies periods of susceptibility during a decade of air pollution exposure.

2. Methods

2.1. Population and outcome

We considered a retrospective cohort of Medicare FFS beneficiaries enrolled by or before Jan. 1, 2000, followed until December 31st, 2016, and residing in the continental United States (i.e., all states plus Washington D.C., excluding Alaska and Hawaii or other non-state territories). Medicare FFS beneficiaries include all adults in the United States age 65 and older who do not purchase private insurance supplements—in 2010 FFS beneficiaries accounted for approximately 76 % of the overall Medicare population (Neuman and Jacobson, 2018). For each individual we extracted all associated hospital inpatient events recorded in Medicare Part A MedPAR files. In addition, from the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary files (MBSF) we obtain annually updated information regarding postal ZIP-code, age, race, sex, an indicator of Medicaid eligibility and date of death for each enrollee. To ensure we had at least 10 years of historical exposure data, we restricted our analysis to individuals who had not had a hospitalization with ADRD, died, or purchased a private Medicare Advantage supplement between Jan. 1, 2000 and Dec. 31, 2009. We define the time span encompassing 2000–2009 as the lead-up period and 2010–2016 as the study period. For each individual in our final study cohort, we updated data annually during the study period through the year they had their first hospitalization with ADRD, died, or were censored by leaving Medicare FFS. See Fig. 1 for a diagram of the study design. This study was done under a protocol approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Written informed consent of individuals was not required due to the nature of the study.

The outcome of interest is the first hospitalization with ADRD billing codes. Our administrative dataset does not allow us to capture the onset of ADRD, which may occur decades prior (Jack et al., 2013). A hospitalization with ADRD is classified using the first 10 billing codes for each hospital admission where codes follow the International Classification of Disease (ICD, including revisions ICD-9 and ICD-10). We identified a hospitalization with ADRD if the ICD codes match those outlined in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse algorithm for ADRD (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, February 2002). See Supplemental Materials for additional details regarding ICD diagnosis codes. Since our study inclusion criteria restricts the study to individuals without such an event during the lead- up period (10 years) we have high confidence that our study identifies the first recorded hospitalization with ADRD.

2.2. Exposure data and covariates

We obtained daily exposure predictions for PM2.5, NO2 and June through August (summer) 8-hour daily maximum ozone on a high resolution 1 km2 grid. The exposure predictions come from a well validated ensemble learning approach and achieve a cross-validated R2 of 0.89, 0.84, and 0.86 for PM2.5, NO2, and summer ozone, respectively; technical details of the exposure prediction models have been previously published (Di et al., 2019; Requia et al., 2020; Di et al., 2020). We calculated annual exposures for each ZIP-code by averaging daily exposures from all grid centroids within the ZIP-code boundaries. During each year of the study period, we assigned an annual exposure history for every remaining individual spanning the previous 10 years and matched at their historical ZIP-code(s) of residence. For example, an individual in our study cohort in 2010 was assigned an exposure history for years 2000–2009; if that same individual remained in the study cohort in 2016 they were assigned an exposure history for 2006–2015.

Using an individual’s ZIP-code of residence, we linked additional neighborhood level demographic and socioeconomic variables derived from the 2000 and 2010 US Census and annual American Community Survey. Demographic variables include population density, percent of individuals who identify as Black or Hispanic, and percent of adults who graduated high school. Socioeconomic variables include median home price to income ratio (PIR), percent owner occupied housing, and percent living below federal poverty level.

2.3. Statistical analysis

We analyzed the association between air pollution and yearly indicator of first hospitalization with ADRD with a discrete time logistic model to accommodate the time-varying exposure history and confounding variables (Richardson, 2010). Specifically, for individual i observed in year t, consider the vector of individual and neighborhood confounder variables xit and a vector of lagged exposures measurements wit=[wi(t−1),⋯,wi(t−10)]′ (i.e., the exposure history recorded during the years t−1,⋯,t−10). We say that individual i has probability P(Yit=1|xit,wit,t) of first hospitalization with ADRD in follow-up year t. The log-odds can be modeled via (1) log{P(Yit=1|xit,wit,t)1−P(Yit=1|xit,wit,t)}=αt+xit′β+f(wit)

where αt is the baseline odds for year t, β is a vector of regression coefficients and f(⋅) represents a DLM for the exposure effect. We estimated effects for each of the three exposures with a separate model. Covariates xit included all previously described neighborhood level covariates, along with individual level variables: sex, Medicaid eligibility, age in year t (included as a quadratic effect to account for a potentially nonlinear association), race (Black, Hispanic, White, or other), and an intercept for US state of residence during year t to account for spatial confounding not captured through local ZIP-code covariates. Additional details in Supplemental Materials.

Motivated by the assumption that exposure effects are distributed across a lagged period of exposure we incorporated a constrained DLM with an additive effect for each year of exposure, f(wit)=∑l=110g(wi(t−l),l) where g(wi(t−l),l) represents the exposure–response function due to exposure wt−l, l years prior to t. We considered both linear and nonlinear exposure–response functions. The DLM imposed a smoothness constraint in g across time using natural splines with 3 degrees of freedom (df) and knots on a natural log scale across lagged time periods. The knot placement allows recent exposure effects to change more quickly than effects at longer lagged periods. For the nonlinear exposure–response function we used a cross basis, combining the smoothness across time as previously described and a natural spline basis on exposure concentration with 5 df and knots at evenly spaced percentiles of wit (Gasparrini et al., 2010). We interpreted the linear effects as an odds ratio (OR) by comparing a change in exposure levels from Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) recommended by the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, 2021). to the US Environmental Protection Agency National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (Environmental Protection, 2021). A change from AGQ to NAAQS amounted to increases of 7 μg/m3 PM2.5, 43 ppb NO2, and 10 ppb Summer ozone. We calculated nonlinear OR at preselected percentiles of exposure as well as AQG and NAAQS, compared to the 0.5 percentile of exposure.

We adjusted for the competing risk of censoring due to death using stabilized inverse probability weights that an individual is still alive (Yazdi et al., 2019), denoted by IPWcr. To calculate IPWcr we first estimated (1) replacing Yit with a binary indicator of death in year t given by Zit = 1. That is, we fit (2) log{P(Zit=1|xit,wit,t)1−P(Zit=1|xit,wit,t)}=αt∗+xit′β∗+f∗(wit)

where αt∗, β∗ and f∗(⋅) are synonymous with (1) but for the outcome of death. Using the fitted probabilities from (2) we calculate IPWcr=P(Zit|wit,t)/P(Zit=0|xit,wit,t), where the numerator is modeled without confounders, which helps to stabilize the weights by bringing them closer to 1. We assume non-death censoring to be independent of the exposures.

Our analysis of the relationship between multi-year air pollution exposure and risk of first hospitalization with ADRD was limited to individuals with complete exposure histories and confounder data (e.g., no missing data). All analyses were performed using R software version 4.0.2 (R Core Team, 2021). with packages mgcv and dlnm; code to reproduce all analyses is available at https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/AirPollution_DistributedLag_ADRD.

Additionally, we performed a sex-stratified analysis and report the relationships between lagged measures of air pollution and odds of first hospitalization for ADRD among female and male Medicare FFS beneficiaries.

2.4. Sensitivity analyses

We completed sensitivity analyses to test the assumptions laid out in this paper. First, we estimated (1) using a single year of exposure history to compare to results from past research which does not consider repeated measurements of exposure and time-lagged effects. Second, we estimated the linear exposure–response DLM using only 5 years of past exposure data to determine the sensitivity of lagged effects to the length of exposure history used. For consistency in smoothness in the 5-year analysis we used a spline basis with 2 degrees of freedom. Third, we included as potential confounders county-specific smoking rate and average body mass index along with ZIP-code-specific summer and winter average maximum temperature and humidity. The smoking rate and body mass index were compiled from the 1999 through 2012 Centers for Disease Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and extrapolated using a rolling average method for the years 2013 through 2016 when this measure was not available. Fourth, we estimated the linear exposure–response DLM using the regression tree method of Mork and Wilson (2022), which avoids the smoothness assumption imposed by splines in the constrained DLM and is more precise in identifying periods of susceptibility. For this alternate DLM approach, we used a random 25 % sample of the final study cohort and compared periods of susceptibility as well as overall effects to our primary analysis. Complete details of our sensitivity analyses can be found in Supplemental Materials.

3. Results

Our study period consisted of 8,507,437 individuals (average age 82.2 in year 2010) with a total of 42,288,065 person-years of data (Fig. 1). During the study period, 1,447,815 individuals experienced their first hospitalization with ADRD event (average age at hospitalization 86.4) and 3,106,560 died (average age at death 86.6). Demographics of the cohort at the beginning of the study period (2010) are given in Table 1. The majority were White, female, not eligible for Medicaid and aged 75 to 79.

Exposure distributions of average annual exposure concentration during the lead-up and study periods for individuals in our study cohort are given in Table 2. The median annual average exposure for PM2.5, NO2 and summer ozone was 10.60 μg/m3, 18.26 ppb and 46.68 ppb, respectively; these levels fell below NAAQS for each pollutant. On the other hand, the 10th percentile of PM2.5 and 25th percentile of NO2 exposures (6.70 μg/m3 and 12.06 ppb, respectively) were above the more stringent AQG recommendations.

The distributed lag relationship between exposure to PM2.5 during the prior decade and increased odds of hospitalization with ADRD was ‘J’-shaped. Specifically, the distributed lag odds ratio (Fig. 2) was 1.08 (95 % CI: [1.07, 1.09]) 1 year prior to admission for a 7 μg/m3 increase (AQG to NAAQS) in PM2.5. The estimated distributed lag ORs decrease to null during 5 to 8 years prior and then increased in years 9 and 10. Complete numerical results of distributed lag effects are given in Supplemental Materials. The cumulative OR (Fig. 3), or OR due to increasing PM2.5 exposure by 7 μg/m3 throughout the past decade, was 1.232 (95 % CI: [1.221,1.243]). Fig. 4 shows how the distributed lag ORs change at various percentiles of PM2.5 exposure (relative to the 0.5 percentile, 2.93 μg/m3) as estimated by the distributed lag model with nonlinear exposure–response function. The nonlinear distributed lag effects overall follow a similar shape to the linear distributed lag effects. We found that the distributed lag ORs at the 10th percentile of PM2.5 exposure were similar or lower compared to lagged ORs at higher levels of exposure. Fig. 5 shows the cumulative ORs from the nonlinear distributed lag model which gives evidence of a sublinear relationship between PM2.5 exposure and first hospitalization with ADRD where the OR increases quickly at lower levels of PM2.5 exposure (i.e., has a steeper slope) and does not change much above the NAAQS exposure standard (12 μg/m3). A person exposed to 5 μg/m3 PM2.5 (the AQG recommendation) over the past decade would have an OR of 1.24 (95 % CI: [1.22, 1.26]) for first hospitalization with ADRD during a given year, whereas someone exposed to 12 μg/m3 PM2.5 (NAAQS) over the past decade would have an OR of 1.72 (95 % CI: [1.68, 1.77]).

The distributed lag relationship between NO2 over the past decade and first hospitalization with ADRD (Fig. 2) found an OR of 1.08 (95 % CI: [1.06, 1.09]) due to the immediate year prior exposure then decreasing to near null at 8 years prior and dropping below 1 in years 9 and 10, for a 43 ppb increase in average NO2 concentration each year. The cumulative OR (Fig. 3) based on the linear effect estimates for increasing NO2 exposure from AQG to NAAQS was 1.392 (95 % CI: [1.374,1.410]). Fig. 4 shows the nonlinear distributed lag function ORs estimated at several percentiles of NO2 exposure concentration (relative to the 0.5 percentile, 3.93 ppb). The nonlinear distributed lag effects give evidence of an increasing association with first hospitalization with ADRD across the range of exposure, especially due to exposure 1 to 6 years prior. The cumulative effects from the nonlinear distributed lag model (Fig. 5) gives evidence of a linear exposure–response relationship where the OR increases across the range of exposure-concentration. A person exposed to AQG levels of NO2 (10 ppb) over the past decade has an OR of 1.204 (95 % CI: [1.181,1.227]), while exposure to the 90th percentile of exposure gives an OR of 1.455 (95 % CI: [1.421,1.490]). We do not make inference at the NAAQS within the nonlinear exposure–response because this exposure-concentration is above the range of the observed exposure in our sample.

Although the distributed lag model relating summer ozone and first hospitalization with ADRD found lagged ORs with confidence intervals below and above 1 (Fig. 2) the cumulative OR (Fig. 3), 1.002 (95 % CI: [0.998,1.005]), was not significantly different from 1. The nonlinear distributed lag function for summer ozone (Fig. 4) replicated these findings and the cumulative ORs (Fig. 5) showed no effect for exposure concentrations between the 10th and 90th percentiles. The ozone concentration described by NAAQS was above the range of annual average exposures observed in our analysis.

Our additional analysis for female- and male-specific lagged relationship found similar patterns for the linear distributed lag model (see Supplement for complete details). In particular, in females we see a slightly increased OR across all lags for PM2.5 exposure. With respect to NO2, the OR is higher for males for exposure 1–2 years prior and lower thereafter. The summer ozone lagged relationships are similar. The cumulative OR for both increased PM2.5 and NO2 exposure over the past decade is higher for females.

The sensitivity analyses (see Supplemental Materials for complete details) were consistent with results from our primary analyses and past studies. Repeating our main analysis using only a 5-year exposure history found similar lagged relationships during the previous five years as in the main analysis and similar cumulative relationships. While this additional analysis conveys similar information regarding the total relationship with air pollution, the 10-year exposure history used in the main analysis allows a more complete picture of the exposure-lag-response function and better corresponds to the pathology of how exposure may impact disease progression (Power et al., 2016). The results from our main analysis were robust to the inclusion of additional ecological risk factors and meteorological confounders. The alternate DLM method found similar periods of susceptibility and cumulative effect estimates for pollution exposure during the prior decade. For PM2.5 the treed DLM found that increased exposure 1 to 2 years prior to admission had an OR above 1 for first hospitalization with ADRD and the OR remained near null for longer lagged exposure periods. For NO2, our sensitivity distributed lag analysis had an additional near null period of effect during years 2–4. The OR of lagged summer ozone exposure during the past decade oscillated slightly above and below 1 in the sensitivity analysis. Limiting the analysis to a single exposure measurement 1 year prior to admission, we found an OR of 1.18 (95 % CI: [1.164,1.204]) for PM2.5, 1.36 (95 % CI: [1.345,1.378]) for NO2 and 1.01 (95 % CI: [1.011,1.017]) for summer ozone when comparing an exposure concentration increase from AQG to NAAQS.

4. Discussion

We present the first study to estimate the association between lagged effects of pollution exposure over 10 years and an ADRD-related outcome using the largest available national database including all individuals age 65 + in the United States. We identified increased odds of first hospitalization with ADRD due to increased PM2.5 exposure from 1 to −5 and 8–10 years prior and due to increased NO2 exposure over the past 8 years. Additionally, exposure above the 0.5 percentile of PM2.5 and NO2 over the past decade had a lagged association with increased odds of first hospitalization with ADRD. Our analysis found significantly increased risks for first hospitalization with ADRD even at low levels (e. g., 10th percentile) of PM2.5 and NO2 exposure concentrations. Moreover, the nonlinear exposure–response for PM2.5 indicates a sublinear relationship where harmful effects of exposure increase most rapidly at low levels of pollution.

For exposure to PM2.5, the period of near null effect 6–7 years prior followed by another positive effect is reminiscent of harvesting (Zanobetti et al., 2000; Schwartz, 2000), where hospitalizations for high-risk individuals are advanced in time due to the effects of pollution exposure leading to a temporary depletion of the risk pool. Although harvesting is most commonly referenced with respect to short-term acute effects, the long-term progression of ADRD make this a plausible explanation. The estimated ORs from the distributed lag nonlinear model lends additional support to the harvesting hypothesis as exposure at the 10th percentile of PM2.5 concentration does not deplete the risk pool as quickly and the effects taper off across the previous decade. In contrast, associations at higher exposure concentrations exhibit harvesting as the lagged effects during the first few years are more severe.

No previous study has considered time lagged effects of air pollution and hospitalization with ADRD. However, our sensitivity analysis with a single time point of exposure (1-year prior) was comparable to previous research. Results from Shi et al. (2020), found an increase in annual average PM2.5 corresponded with a hazard ratio of 1.19 for first hospitalization with ADRD (adjusted to be on the same scale as our linear effect estimates). In a multi-pollutant model Shi et al. (2021), found that an increase in 5-year average PM2.5, NO2, and summer ozone was associated with hazard ratios (adjusted for comparison) of 1.14, 1.07, and 0.98 respectively. Although the logistic model in our study gives odds ratios to quantify the associations while the aforementioned studies estimate hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazard models, the parameter estimates are comparable when the event rate (i.e., hospitalization with ADRD) is slow (Abbott, 1985).

Our outcome of hospitalization with ADRD is not the same as onset of ADRD, which may occur decades prior to any formal diagnosis. The first hospitalization outcome may be a proxy of more severe symptoms or comorbidities coinciding with ADRD. Therefore, our results can be interpreted as increased air pollution exposure during the previous decade is related to exacerbation of disease. In terms of risk prevention strategies, reducing air pollution standards to recommended AQG may relate to reduced hospitalizations related to ADRD over the next 1–5 years for PM2.5 and up to 8 years for NO2. However, the nonlinear models indicate the relationships between air pollution and hospitalization with ADRD exists even at low levels of air pollution and further reduction beyond AQG may be necessary for larger health benefits. Additionally, more work can be done to identify the specific components of PM2.5 that may be most harmful to the brain by exacerbating neurological disorders.

Our study has several limitations. First, the average age of first hospitalization with ADRD was similar during the lead-up (85.8) and study periods (86.4), but the average age of death during the study period was higher (86.6 compared to 81.8 during the lead-up period) which may indicate the inferential population was healthier than the average Medicare FFS population. Second, the 10-year lead-up period gives us high confidence we are capturing the first hospitalization with ADRD, but we are not able to draw conclusions for earlier-onset ADRD hospitalizations before age 75. Third, spline-constrained distributed lag models are known to over-smooth, leading to an over-generalization of periods of susceptibility (Mork and Wilson, 2022). We applied an alternate distributed lag method to a subset of the data (see Supplemental Materials) and found similar cumulative ORs and periods of susceptibility. Changes in the effect size and periods of susceptibility in our sensitivity analyses may be partially due to a smaller sample and therefore lower power to detect effects. Fourth, the daily exposure assessment at ZIP-codes used to approximate the average annual exposure may not be representative of individual exposure and has the potential for measurement error. However, the exposure models showed excellent predictive accuracy and any measurement error is likely independent of disease status resulting in potential bias towards the null (Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2014; Josey et al., 2022). Fifth, Medicare Part A inpatient hospitalization files do not include individual-level behavior data such as smoking and alcohol consumption, obesity, genetic factors, or occupational data that may confound the outcome or mediate the exposure effect. We did adjust for multiple neighborhood-level variables—both demographic and socioeconomic—that may serve as a surrogate for other unmeasured individual-level risks. Additionally, previous work has shown that absence of individual covariates in air pollution epidemiology did not impact the results (Makar et al., 2017; Di et al., 2017). Sixth, hospital billing codes classifying ADRD may be susceptible to misclassification (Festa et al., 2022). A recent study showed the CCW algorithm applied to Medicare parts A and B data had a 92.3 % specificity and 56.8 % sensitivity in identifying patients with ADRD (McCarthy et al., 2022). Because our dataset only includes part A claims we believe our outcome will have similar specificity but lower sensitivity, resulting in potential bias towards the null (Taylor et al., 2002). Future work that includes Medicare parts B (outpatient) and D (prescriptions) could provide a more rigorous validation criteria for disease classification in Medicare claims (Jain et al., 2021; Moura et al., 2021). Finally, the present analysis is observational and the results can only be interpreted as an association, which may not be generalizable beyond the geographic boundaries of our cohort. However, the biological mechanisms of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation provides a pathway for the effect of air pollution on ADRD and future work incorporating causal inference methodologies could strengthen an argument for causality.

The strengths of this study give us a high degree of confidence in the reported results. We used the largest available national US cohort dataset and incorporated a longitudinal study design with over a decade of well validated historical exposure predictions at each individual’s ZIP-code of residence. We controlled for a range of individual and neighborhood covariates and allowed for state-specific baseline hospitalization rates to account for spatial differences in the rate of hospitalization with ADRD not captured by the local confounders. Our analysis adjusted for competing risk of censoring by death, which has been directly linked as an effect of long-term air pollution exposure (Wu et al., 2020). However, we note results without the competing risk adjustment were similar. Our study design incorporated knowledge that ADRD develops over many years and considers the potential delayed effects of air pollution exposure. The study characteristics contrast past studies on ADRD where small samples limit the ability to detect relationships with ambient pollution exposures or exposure is measured only once prior to the outcome of interest. Nevertheless, the relationships with air pollution found in our results are consistent with prior national cohort studies on hospitalization with ADRD (Shi et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021).

Our paper presents the first analysis to consider lagged effects of air pollution for hospitalization with ADRD and adds evidence quantifying a detrimental relationship between air pollution and ADRD. If we consider hospitalization a proxy for moderate or severe disease, then our results argue that air pollution exposure from up to a decade prior may be related to an acceleration of the progression from early biological markers towards more serious symptoms of ADRD. Considering disease etiology for ADRD, which has been shown to develop over a timespan of decades, the lagged exposure effects in our study suggests that air pollution plays a more sinister role throughout life with respect to ADRD.

Fig. 1. Diagram of study design. Each line represents the follow-up for an individual with historical exposure-concentration levels (y-axis) until the first year (x-axis) of a hospitalization with ADRD (shown by A), death (shown by D), or censoring event (shown by C). Individuals are followed during the lead-up period to construct a minimum 10-year exposure history and our analysis considered all individuals who made it to the beginning of the study period.

Fig. 2. Distributed lag odd ratios (y-axis) with 95% confidence intervals (shaded area) from one to ten prior years (x-axis) due to a change from AQG to NAAQS levels (Table 2) in each pollutant. See Supplemental Materials Table S2 for numerical table of estimates.

Fig. 3. Cumulative odds ratios for each pollutant with 95% confidence intervals. Cumulative ORs are calculated by summing the distributed lag estimates over the entire exposure time span.

Fig. 4. Distributed lag nonlinear effect estimates at five different percentiles (line type and color, exposure-concentration percentiles given in Table 2). The odds ratio (y-axis) at each percentile is shown at one to ten prior years of exposure (x-axis) for each pollutant (panels). Connecting the lines in increasing percentile at each lag represents the shape of the exposure–response (see Supplemental Materials). Odds ratios relative to 0.5 percentile of exposure concentration.

Fig. 5. Cumulative odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals at five different exposure concentration percentiles, AQG, and NAAQS (Table 2) for each of three pollutants (panels) from the distributed lag model with nonlinear exposure–response. Cumulative ORs are calculated by summing across time the distributed lag nonlinear effects taken at the corresponding exposure concentration. See Supplemental Materials Table S3 for numerical estimates.
