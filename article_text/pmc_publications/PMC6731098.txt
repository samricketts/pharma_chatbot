Objective

This research aimed to determine whether qualitative analyses of different types of intrusion errors on a verbal cognitive task were useful in detecting subtle cognitive impairment in preclinical stages prior to the progression to dementia.

Method

Different types of intrusion errors on the Loewenstein-Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) were compared across 160 individuals diagnosed as Cognitively Normal (CN), amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), or dementia. The sample included Hispanics and non-Hispanic European Americans.

Results

Across diagnostic groups, the most common type of intrusion error were actual words presented from a competing word list under conditions eliciting proactive semantic interference (PSI) and retroactive semantic interference (RSI), followed by intrusions that represented one of three overlapping semantic categories but none of the targets from List A or B. Unrelated intrusions rarely occurred. These Competing List intrusions (CLI) and Semantically Related intrusions (SRI) differentiated between aMCI and CN participants. Further, these intrusion errors were related to brain amyloid load, indicating their importance as potential primary markers of AD-related neurodegeneration. Ethnicity effects were not seen across the types of intrusion errors.

Conclusions

Two types of intrusion errors (CLI and SRI) showed differences between the CN and aMCI groups, with the aMCI group evidencing a higher rate of these intrusion errors compared to the CN group. These results support previous literature about the LASSI-L’s sensitivity at the earliest stages of abnormal aging.

MCI
Memory

One of the early features of the amnestic presentation of Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) appears to be an increased susceptibility to Proactive Semantic Interference (PSI) effects in memory tasks, when old learning interferes with new learning (See Brooks &amp; Loewenstein, 2010). Retroactive Semantic interference (RSI) effects, in which new learning interferes with older information, have also been found but with less prevalence among participants with suspected memory deficits (Loewenstein et al., 2004). It has been suggested that an increased vulnerability to PSI for items related to a semantically similar competing target list could aid in the differentiation between cognitively normal individuals and those with aMCI or mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Crocco, Curiel, Acevedo, Czaja, &amp; Loewenstein, 2014; Borella et al., 2017).

Borella et al. (2017) evaluated individuals using a memory test consisting of two sets of words, allowing for the accumulation of PSI. These researchers reported that participants with MCI had increased PSI associated with lower recall of words on the second list and concluded that an increased demand in tasks with high semantic interference resulted in greater difficulty in inhibiting irrelevant information (Borella et al., 2017).

Besides using the number of correct items to characterize PSI, Borella et al. (2017) also tested resistance to PSI using the number of intrusion errors made on the same memory task. Fuld, Katzman, Davies, and Terry (1982) defined intrusion errors as incorrect responses from a previous test or procedure. As expected, Borella et al. (2017) also found a higher rate of intrusion errors in the MCI group compared to controls. They suggested that intrusion errors occurred because of the MCI group’s inability to inhibit words that were useful earlier on the test but should have lost relevance as the task progressed.

Loewenstein et al. (2004) used the Semantic Interference Test (SIT), a paradigm using common household objects in two separate bags which participants had to identify first by touch followed by sight, and complete subsequent recall trials. This study found that participants with mild AD showed more PSI effects, followed by the MCI group, and lastly, the controls. On the other hand, RSI effects were similar for MCI and mild AD patients, however these groups showed more susceptibility to RSI than cognitively normal controls. It was therefore concluded that PSI may be more severe than RSI, and that the level of both effects corresponds to the severity of the underlying neurological disease. The authors further suggested that greater susceptibility to PSI might reflect impartial encoding of to-be-remembered targets or difficulties in inhibitory mechanisms. Other research has supported deficits in the quality of initial encoding as a reason behind increased PSI (Rouleau, Imbault, Laframboise, &amp; Bedard, 2001).

Intrusion errors

Besides analyzing various aspects of inhibition to determine the level of decline, another promising analysis is to examine the qualitative nature of the intrusion errors made during tests such as those described above. Measures that add a distractor trial between recall trials demonstrated that patients with mild AD have an increased susceptibility to intrusion errors, suggesting an incomplete processing of words, such as remembering words that were not originally presented but belong to the same semantic category (Loewenstein et al., 2004). Indeed, increased semantic intrusion errors occurred with the highest frequency on list-learning tests (Loewenstein et al., 1991; Schram, Rubert, &amp; Loewenstein, 1995), and differentiated MCI patients from those with mild AD (Loewenstein et al., 1991).

Crocco, Curiel, Acevedo, Czaja, and Loewenstein (2014) used the Loewenstein Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L) with a sample of normal elderly, aMCI, and probable AD participants. Results indicated that most intrusion errors were words from the competing list, followed by semantically related items not found on either word list. Furthermore, participants with aMCI and dementia made more intrusion errors than controls, and a greater number of errors occurred on cued recall rather than free recall, suggesting that employing the same semantic cue at both acquisition and retrieval activated the semantic network and caused increased difficulties with source memory and inhibitory responses (Loewenstein, Curiel, Duara, &amp; Buschke, 2018).

Other tests of semantically related items, such as the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 1987) have shown sensitivity distinguishing MCI from normal aging (Greenaway et al., 2006). The CVLT includes two lists belonging to four categories along with free and cued recall trials, and has been used to observe intrusion errors and explore their relationship with AD. This measure, in combination with the Wechsler Memory Scale-III Logical Memory, Story A (Abikoff, 1987), is sensitive in differentiating MCI from normal aging (Rabin et al., 2009).

Besides examining the number of correctly recalled items on the CVLT, intrusion errors on this test are a significant predictor of the risk for conversion to AD (Bondi, Salmon, Galasko, Thomas, &amp; Thal, 1999), and may predict progression from cognitively normal to MCI, and from cognitively normal to AD after controlling for demographic characteristics, depression, genetic susceptibility, and other factors (Thomas et al., 2018). This suggests that the cognitive changes that lead to intrusion errors may appear before the deficits that can be observed in the total scores derived from neuropsychological measures.

The current study

Most studies concerning the diagnostic criteria for MCI focus on total scores or the number of errors on neuropsychological tests. This research proposes a qualitative analysis of intrusion errors on a verbal cognitive task in normal and abnormal aging. We aimed to determine whether this analysis was useful in detecting subtle cognitive impairment in the preclinical stages of dementia. Despite the evidence that intrusions in tests of memory interference are early manifestations of AD (Thomas et al., 2018), there have not been any studies, to our knowledge, that have examined the occurrence of different types of intrusion errors across conditions that are susceptible to PSI and RSI in older adults with aMCI. In this study, intrusion errors made on the LASSI-L were divided into three categories: Competing List intrusions (CLI), Semantically Related intrusions (SRI), and Unrelated intrusions (UI). These intrusion errors were compared across free and cued recall trials of the LASSI-L. Because investigations involving free and cued recall have found that cued recall performance is superior to that of free recall (Watkins &amp; Thomson, 1973), we wanted to explore whether this memory advantage was also associated to fewer intrusion errors. A unique aspect of this investigation was to assess the diagnostic validity of intrusion errors with underlying neurodegenerative disease by correlating these errors with amyloid load, a valid biomarker of AD (Landau, Horng, Jagust, &amp; the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2018; Rowe &amp; Villemagne, 2013). Demonstrated that frPSI is associated with increased amyloid load in AD-prone regions (Loewenstein et al., 2016).

We hypothesized that the types of intrusion errors would differ across diagnostic groups. We predicted that the Cognitively Normal (CN) group would have the lowest number of intrusion errors, followed by the aMCI group, and lastly, the dementia group, which was expected to present the highest number of intrusion errors. We also hypothesized that across all groups, CLI and SRI would be the most common errors and could differentiate between CN and aMCI participants.

As our sample included Hispanics and non-Hispanics (European Americans), we conducted further analyses considering whether their ethnic background was related to the types of intrusion errors made. This is particularly important considering that Hispanic elderly adults typically perform worse on cognitive tests (Uzzell, Ponton, &amp; Ardila, 2007) and are reported to suffer from higher rates of AD compared to non-Hispanics (Burke et al., 2018).

Method

Participants

Participants were recruited from the Memory Disorders Center at the Wien Center for Alzheimer’s Disease and Memory Disorders at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Florida. The sample included 160 participants (97 female), whose mean age was 71.96 (SD = 7.76). The present project was part of the ¡Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), an ongoing longitudinal Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study (Mount Sinai Medical Center-IRB) in which participants are tested with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. The current study used data obtained during the baseline evaluation.

Participants were subdivided into three groups: CN, aMCI, and dementia. The sample consisted of 50 CN, 81 aMCI, and 29 dementia participants. The CN group did not report memory deficits or impairment in daily function. This group had a Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR; Morris, 1993) of 0, and did not show indications of cognitive decline upon clinical interview. The CN group had standard scores on neuropsychological measures less than 1 SD below expected levels related to age, education, and culturally related norms on the following measures: a) Delayed Recall of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R; Brandt, 1991), b) Delayed Recall of the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) story passage (Beekly et al., 2007); c) Category and Phonemic Fluency (Benton &amp; Hamsher, 1976), d) Block Design of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 1997), and e) Trail-Making Test B (TMT-B; Reitan &amp; Wolfson, 1986).

The aMCI group had memory complaints confirmed by a reliable collateral informant, no impairment in their daily life activities, and had scores on the HVLT-R (Brandt, 1991) or NACC story delayed recall (Beekly et al., 2007) of 1.5 SD or greater below what is expected using the same normative data listed for the CN group. Other non-memory measures (such as the TMT- B and Category Fluency) could demonstrate 1.5 SD or greater above or below the mean, but a memory deficit had to be established. This group had a CDR of 0.5 and met the criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder diagnosis according to the Diagnostics and Statistical Manual and Mental Disorders (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013).

Individuals with dementia had a CDR of 1.0, scores more than 1.5 SD below the mean on memory and non-memory measures, and reported impairments in daily life, assessed by the Functional Activities Questionnaire (Pfeffer, Kuroski, Harrah, Chance, &amp; Filos, 1982). This group also met criteria for a major neurocognitive disorder and clinically, they all met the criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 2011). Twenty-five participants with dementia met criteria for probable AD dementia with evidence of the AD pathophysiological processes, including cortical atrophy and abnormal concentrations of brain amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein deposition. Four participants in this group did not show positive biomarkers for AD. In all cases, clinical diagnosis was made by consensus between a neurologist, a neuropsychologist, and a psychiatrist, after analyzing neuropsychological tests, interviewing study partners, and observing MRI and PET scans.

Participants showing motor or sensory deficits, literacy levels at or below a sixth-grade level, psychiatric disorders, or those with major depressive disorder were excluded. Additionally, those taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or antipsychotics were excluded. Individuals born in countries other than the United States or those who were not immigrants from Latin American countries were also excluded.

We compared demographic variables between groups using univariate General Linear Models (GLM). Age, gender, and testing language did not vary significantly across the three groups, p &gt; .05, while Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975) scores did (see Tables 1 and 2). Years of education also differed significantly between the three diagnostic groups, F(2,157) = 3.50, p = .033, ηp2 = .04. Therefore, education was included as a covariate in all subsequent analyses. In terms of ethnicity, 101 participants reported being of Hispanic origin, and 59 reported being non-Hispanic of European American origin.

Materials and Procedures

Participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation which assessed different cognitive domains: verbal memory was measured using the LASSI-L (Curiel et al., 2013), HVLT-R (Brandt, 1991), the Craft Story (Craft et al., 1996), and Logical Memory (Abikoff et al., 1987); confrontation naming was tested with the Multilingual Naming Test (Gollan, Weissberger, Runnqvist, Montoya, &amp; Cera, 2012); visuospatial cognitive functioning was evaluated with the Benson Figure Drawing (Possin, Laluz, Alcantar, Miller, &amp; Kramer, 2011) and WAIS-IV Block Design (Wechsler, 2014); overall cognition was estimated using the MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005); executive functioning was appraised through the Stroop Task (Stroop, 1935; Trenerry, Crosson, DeBoe, &amp; Leber 1989), TMT A and B (Corrigan &amp; Hinkeldey, 1987; Reitan, 1958; Reitan &amp; Wolfson, 1993), and finally, verbal fluency was assessed with Category and Phonemic fluency (Benton &amp; Hamsher, 1976).

The memory test analyzed in the current study is part of this neuropsychological battery; other tests will not be analyzed in the present study. Additionally, the LASSI-L was not used for diagnostic purposes.

Loewenstein Acevedo Scales of Semantic Interference and Learning (LASSI-L)

Participants are tasked with remembering two lists with 15 words each, all of which are fruits, musical instruments, or articles of clothing (see Figure 1 for administration procedure and Appendix A for LASSI-L words). The words are presented one at a time on cards and are read by the participants. Participants are made aware of the semantic categories, which helps facilitate and guide their learning. Once all 15 words from the first list (List A) have been presented, there is a free recall trial, followed by cued recall trials for each of the three categories (i.e., fruits, musical instruments, and articles of clothing). List A is presented again, and an additional cued recall trial for each category is conducted. A second list of words (List B) from the same semantic categories is subsequently presented. This is followed by a free recall trial and three cued recall trials (one per category). Lastly, List B is presented for a second time, with another round of cued recall trials. At this point, the participant is asked to think back to List A, and a free recall and cued recall trials are conducted. Participants are allowed 60 seconds during free recall trials, and 20 seconds for each semantic category during cued recall trials. After 20 minutes, there is a delayed free recall of both lists.

Previous analyses of the LASSI-L have demonstrated its sensitivity in differentiating between aMCI and CN participants (Loewenstein et al., 2016). In addition, this test can identify PSI and RSI effects. The LASSI-L has been found to have adequate test-retest reliability (r = .60 to r = .89) among aMCI and early dementia, in addition, high discriminative and concurrent validity were reported (Crocco et al., 2014). Noteworthy, the LASSI-L has shown cross-cultural sensitivity in the diagnosis of CN and aMCI Hispanic older adults (Curiel et al., 2017).

While the LASSI-L uses a paradigm like other semantic verbal memory tests such as the CVLT-II (Delis, Kramer, Kaplan, &amp; Ober, 2000) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Rey, 1941), the greatest difference is in allowing the participants to read the words aloud (as opposed to being presented with these aurally). Reading the words was designed to help with the acquisition of the to-be-remembered targets by using multimodal encoding (visual and auditory). This is commonly done in widely used instruments with the elderly, such as the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD; Morris et al., 1993). Additionally, the LASSI-L differs from the CVLT-II and the RAVLT in that the participant is provided with category cues at both the initial encoding and retrieval stages which fosters better encoding of the initial 15 targets and leads to semantic intrusions (Loewenstein et al., 2018).

Procedure

Participants were administered a neuropsychological battery which included the LASSI-L. In addition to this, blood tests, a short physical examination, and a clinician interview to corroborate the patients’ memory complaints were conducted. Some participants were tested for brain amyloid load with PET scans.

Quantifying intrusion errors on the LASSI-L

Intrusion errors on the LASSI-L were divided into three categories: CLI, SRI, and UI and can be found on Appendix B. Words recalled belonging to the non-target list were classified as CLI, but were only possible after the presentation of List B. When only List A had been presented, errors could only be categorized as SRI or UI. That is, if an error during the initial recall of List A was a word from List B, it was not considered a CLI, as List B had yet to be presented. For the rest of the trials, words from the non-target list were counted as CLI. Words related to the categories that appeared on the LASSI-L (i.e., a fruit, musical instrument, or an article of clothing) were categorized as SRI due to their semantic similarity. Lastly, an intrusion error consisting of words that do not belong to the three categories (fruits, musical instruments, or articles of clothing), for example, the word “blue”, would be classified as an UI, as it has no apparent similarity to the semantic categories used. Two independent judges categorized intrusion errors to ensure reliability. These judges were blind to the participants’ diagnoses.

The classification of intrusion errors was partly based on results from Rouleau et al. (2001) that nonrelated intrusions occurred more often in AD compared with Parkinson’s disease and dementia with prominent frontal lobe semiology, and between mild AD and mild MCI (Loewenstein et al., 1991). Additionally, the most common intrusion errors reported were words from the non-target list or words from the same semantic category. More importantly, as described above, Crocco et al. (2014) reported that most intrusion errors on the LASSI-L were from the non-target list and occurred often in all groups (including normal elderly individuals), followed by SRI made by aMCI and AD participants. Therefore, because the neuropsychological test and the sample used in Crocco et al.’s (2014) study and the current study were similar, this influenced our decision to include these two types of errors. Previous studies have outlined several types of intrusion errors (Rouleau et al., 2001; Loewenstein et al., 1991), however, to reduce the overlap in the error categories (ensuring a word could not belong to more than one category) and to strengthen the analysis, three categories were used (i.e., CLI, SRI and UI). Lastly, while categorizing the intrusion errors, we observed that all fit into these three categories.

Amyloid imaging

To quantify amyloid load from the PET scans obtained from some participants, the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) was employed to co-register the PET image to the aforementioned MRI T1 image. The Florbetaben PET scans, including the outline of the skull, were co-registered linearly (i.e., trilinear interpolation) with 12 degrees of freedom onto the T1 image from the MRI scan. Such a registration process ensured that the PET image had the same accurate segmentation and parcellation as in the MRI. Thus, mean uptake in counts for each of the FreeSurfer defined regions were calculated and global Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) was calculated by averaging cortical uptake in the frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, occipital, and anterior and posterior cingulate regions, normalized to mean gray matter counts in the cerebellum. SUVR values were normalized to the mean cerebellar gray matter, which has minimal amyloid load in AD (Curiel et al., 2018). The typical mean SUVR cut-off for amyloid positivity is 1.42 (Bullich et al., 2017). From our sample, 116 individuals (37 CN, 55 aMCI, and 24 dementia) had this data available, and within this subsample, the mean SUVR ranged from 1.0470 to 2.2299 (SD = .29), with 50 individuals at or above the threshold of 1.42.

Statistical Analyses

Differences were initially analyzed using ANCOVAs with education as a covariate. However, as education was non-significant (all ps &gt; .05), it was removed from all analyses. Results are reported using ANOVAs. Corrections for multiple comparisons were done and the p-values were set to .003 for the analyses of number and type of intrusion error (16 comparisons). For the analyses of free and cued recall trials (14 comparisons), the p-value was set to .004. Additionally, due to the unequal variance of the groups, post hoc analyses were performed using Tamhane’s T2 statistic.

Number of intrusion errors

To explore differences in the number of total intrusion errors across the three diagnostic groups, a three-way ANOVA was conducted.

Type of intrusion errors

One-way Univariate ANOVAs were conducted to compare each type of intrusion error and diagnostic group.

Free and cued recall trials

To examine differences between the types of intrusion errors made during free and cued recall trials, Repeated Measures ANOVAs were conducted for each diagnostic group and with the number of CLI and SRI made on free versus cued recall trials. These analyses were done for the two PSI conditions (Free B1 and Cued B1) and the two RSI conditions (Free A2 and Cued A3). Additionally, we calculated two scores to better understand overall differences in intrusion errors across the diagnostic groups in free compared to cued recall, a) the difference between the number of intrusion errors on Free A1 and Cued A1, and b) the difference between intrusion errors on Free B1 and Cued B1.

Ethnicity and intrusion errors

Due to the characteristics of the sample, differences in the number and type of intrusion errors made between European American and Hispanic individuals were examined. To analyze the number of intrusion errors, a 3X2 GLM was conducted, with the between-subjects factors as the three diagnostic groups and the two ethnic groups. A similar GLM was performed to evaluate differences in the types of intrusion errors (all three types) as the within-subjects factor. As some individuals of Hispanic origin chose to be tested in English, the variable of language of evaluation was also included. In this case, the total number of intrusion errors made in each language across the diagnostic groups were compared only within the Hispanic group using a 3X2 GLM.

Amyloid and intrusion errors

We used a series of Pearson Product Moment correlation coefficients to study the associations between amyloid load and the types of intrusion errors within a subsample of our participants who had PET scans available (n = 116).

The Levene statistic indicated unequal variance in the analyses of the number of intrusion errors, the types of intrusion errors, and when comparing differences in cued and free recall across the diagnostic groups. In these cases, Welch’s ANOVAs were conducted, and all results remained equal.

Results

Total Intrusion Errors

Table 3 displays the means and standard deviations of the correct scores in each LASSI-L subtest and the percentage of intrusion errors out of the total responses within each trial across diagnostic groups. An ANOVA followed by a post hoc indicated that for all types of intrusion errors, the dementia group made the greatest number (M = 24.66, SD = 14.29), followed by the aMCI group (M = 22.16, SD = 16.28), and finally, the CN group (M = 11.78, SD = 8.66; Table 4). Overall, the groups differed from each other in the total number of intrusion errors, F(2,157) = 11.09, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = 12. Post hoc analyses revealed that these differences were significant between the CN and aMCI groups, p &lt; .001, and between the CN and dementia groups, p &lt; .001. The comparison between the aMCI and dementia groups was not significant.

Types of Intrusion Errors

The Univariate ANOVA (Table 4) revealed differences in the number of CLI across groups, p &lt; .001, with the post hoc indicating significant differences only between the CN and aMCI groups, p &lt; .001. The CN group had the lowest number of CLI, followed by the dementia group, and finally, the aMCI group.

Semantically Related Intrusions SRI also differed across diagnostic groups, p &lt; .001. Post hoc results indicated significant differences between the CN and aMCI groups, p = .001, and CN and dementia groups, p &lt; .001. The CN group had the lowest number of SRI, followed by the aMCI, and lastly, the dementia group.

The Unrelated Intrusions (UI) analysis was not significant (See Figure 2).

Intrusion Errors on Free versus Cued recall

The following analyses of the types of intrusion errors on free compared with cued recall trials only included CLI and SRI; no differences in UI were found across groups (Table 6).

Proactive semantic interference intrusion errors

On trials evaluating PSI (Free B1 and Cued B1) significant differences were found in the number of CLI made by all groups, with a higher number of CLI on Cued B1 compared to Free B1: CN: F(1,49) = 45.64,p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .48; aMCI: F(1,80) = 88.17, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = 52; and dementia: F(1,28) = 20.22, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .42.

For the CN group, the number of SRI did not differ across trials. In the aMCI and the dementia groups, a greater number of SRI were made on Cued B1 than on Free B1, F(1,80) = 9.73, p = .003, ηp2 = 11, and F(1,28) = 16.16, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .37, respectively.

Retroactive semantic interference intrusion errors

In all groups, an increase of CLI was found on Cued A3 compared with Free A2; CN, F(1,49) = 17.38,p &lt; .001, ηp2 = 26; aMCI, F(1,80) = 56.69, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = 42; and dementia, F(1,28) = 70.33, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = .72.

The number of SRI did not increase significantly for any of the diagnostic groups in these trials.

When comparing the difference scores in the total number of intrusion errors in free versus cued recall trials, no significant differences emerged when comparing Cued A1 and Free A1, or Cued B1 and Free B1 (Table 5).

Ethnic Group

The main effect of ethnic group was not significant F(1,154) = .72, p = .40, ηp2 = 005. Similarly, the interaction of ethnic group with diagnostic group did not reveal any differences in the total number of intrusion errors, F(1,154) = .16, p = .86, ηp2 = 002. The interaction between the types of intrusion errors with ethnic and diagnostic group was not significant.

Some Hispanic individuals (n = 28) preferred to be evaluated in English, therefore, this variable was included in the analyses. The main effect of language of evaluation did not reach significance. The interaction of testing language and diagnostic group did not reach significance, either.

Amyloid Load and Intrusion Errors

The subsample of individuals with available amyloid load data included 37 CN, 55 aMCI, and 24 dementia participants. Amyloid levels differed significantly across the three diagnostic groups, F(2,113) = 19.39, p &lt; .001, ηp2 = 26. The CN group had the lowest mean SUVR, followed the aMCI group, and lastly, the dementia group (See Table 7).

The analyses exploring the relationship between global SUVR and the intrusion errors revealed significant correlations (Table 8). CLI, SRI, and UI showed significant positive correlations to global SUVR values, with the highest correlation between global SUVR with SRI, r = .45, p &lt; .001. Lastly, the total number of intrusion errors on the LASSI-L also correlated positively to amyloid load (p &lt; .001).

Discussion

The present study examined intrusion errors on a verbal memory test (LASSI-L) to determine whether these could yield additional information about cognitive status in cognitively normal and in individuals suffering from memory decline due to abnormal aging. We used the total number of intrusion errors and classified these into three types: CLI, SRI, and UI. These variables were compared across three diagnostic groups: CN, aMCI, and dementia. Comparisons were also made across free and cued recall trials on the LASSI-L and the total and the types of intrusion errors on each type of recall. As the sample included European Americans and Hispanics, we conducted additional analyses exploring whether the number and type of intrusion error would vary across these ethnic groups and the preferred language of evaluation in the Hispanic group. Finally, the intrusion errors produced by a subsample of individuals from the three diagnostic groups were correlated to a measure of amyloid load to determine their clinical validity.

Total Intrusion Errors

The dementia group exhibited the highest number of intrusion errors, followed by the aMCI group, and lastly, the CN group. The overall model indicated that the CN and aMCI groups, and the CN and dementia groups, differed significantly in the types of intrusion errors made. These results are consistent with previous research showing that these errors in memory association tasks may distinguish normal from abnormal aging (Libon et al., 2011; Greenaway et al., 2006; Schmid, Taylor, Foldi, Berres, Monsch, 2013)

Types of Intrusion Errors

Upon comparison of the total number of the three categories of intrusion errors, we found that CLI occurred most often, followed by SRI, and lastly, UI.

Competing list intrusions

As expected, the CN group had the lowest number of CLI. An unexpected result was that the aMCI group made more CLI than the dementia group, although this was not statistically significant. It is possible that the deficits in the semantic networks corresponding to the LASSI-L categories in the dementia group hindered their ability to memorize words from either list, so upon recall, they resorted to other types of intrusions, (i.e., words not found on either list; SRI and UI), consistent with previous research indicating that UI occur in dementia (Schram et al., 1995). Possibly, as the aMCI group may retain their ability to encode and remember words, their errors are a result of their inability to maintain List A and List B separate during recall.

Semantically related intrusions

The results from the analysis of SRI revealed a different trend from the one found in CLI, in which the CN group made a fewer number, followed by the aMCI group, and lastly, the dementia group. This finding suggests that semantic errors are associated with the severity of cognitive decline in dementia and supports the idea that the pattern of verbal recall by dementia patients reflects deficits in semantic knowledge and lexical access (Davis, Price, Kaplan, &amp; Libon, 2002). It seems that individuals with dementia are impaired at successfully storing words from either word list. SRI can occur from the inability to inhibit words that are part of the semantic categories used on the LASSI-L (i.e., fruits, musical instruments, and articles of clothing). It seems that upon recall, the impaired groups, particularly the dementia group, were unable to inhibit the retrieval of words belonging to the same semantic category as the LASSI-L words.

Unrelated intrusions

The UI analysis revealed that the number of UI made by the sample was low, but it is important to note that these intrusion errors still occurred across groups even though they did not differ significantly. Vallet et al. (2017) showed that AD patients made significantly more intrusion errors on an episodic memory task compared to normal adults. Intrusion errors were defined in this study as the recall or recognition of an item never presented to the participant in the encoding phase. Although the authors do not specify how many of these intrusions were semantically related to the target words, it is possible that many of them are similar to our UI. Therefore, future research should explore whether individuals who make any UI might have an underlying deficit and might progress to aMCI or dementia at an accelerated rate.

Within our sample, that two types of intrusion errors (CLI and SRI) successfully distinguished between CN and aMCI samples, with the aMCI group having a higher frequency of these compared to the CN group. The dementia group differed only from the CN group in the number of SRI. Our results support previous findings indicating that deficits in the semantic network organization are observed in dementia and aMCI (Mascali et al., 2018; Vogel, Johannsen, Stokholm, &amp; Jorgensen, 2014). These are manifested with different types of intrusions. Impaired semantic networks may result not only in UI, but also SRI. For instance, during testing, when the cue ‘fruits’ is provided, this category may extend in weakened semantic networks to include other food-related words (e.g., vegetables). As our sample included clinically-diagnosed AD patients, their increase in SRI and CLI can be assumed to reflect AD-related deficits.

Intrusion Errors on Free versus Cued Recall

Analyses were conducted to examine variations in the types and the total number of intrusion errors that occurred within groups on cued versus free recall trials on the LASSI-L. When only examining the total difference in cued compared with the corresponding free recall trials, we did not find significant differences across the diagnostic groups. However, a more detailed analysis including the three types of intrusion errors resulted in group differences.

Across all three diagnostic groups, the number of CLI increased on cued recall compared to free recall trials. It appears that the cueing provided on Cued B1 and Cued A3 leads to an increase in intrusion errors from the non-target list (i.e., CLI), even among the CN group. This finding can suggest that the ability to keep word lists separate is hindered by semantic cues. The cueing on tests of verbal memory is expected to aid in the correct recall of words, with a failure to benefit from the cueing procedure being characteristic of AD (Carlesimo, Perri, &amp; Caltagirone, 2011). However, it seems that when participants are asked to activate a semantic category, that is, all the fruits from List B, they are simultaneously recalling fruits from List A. Similar results indicating more intrusion errors on cued than on free recall trials on the LASSI-L have been previously found (Crocco et al., 2014).

From these results, it can be concluded that the distinguishing factor between CN and aMCI in terms of the types of intrusion errors made on cued versus free recall trials is the increase of SRI by the aMCI group on trials sensitive to PSI. While both groups increased their overall frequency of intrusion errors on cued recall trials, only the aMCI group added words that were not on either list. It is evident that the deterioration of the semantic networks may begin in aMCI, and upon cueing, the impaired network is activated and results in the increased occurrence of SRI. SRI did not differ significantly between Free A2 and Cued A3 in the aMCI or in the dementia group, however, the number was higher in the cued recall trial than on the free recall trial. It seems that conditions sensitive to PSI are better at detecting impairments in sematic networks compared with RSI conditions. We also found that examining the total number of intrusion errors on free compared with cued recall by itself was not sufficient to find group differences. This suggests that the distinguishing factor across the diagnostic groups relates to the types of intrusion errors, not the total number when comparing free and cued recall trials, at least in the LASSI-L. UI did not differ significantly when compared across free and cued recall trials.

Ethnic Group

As these data are being collected in South Florida, the sample is culturally diverse, including both European Americans and individuals from multiple Spanish-speaking countries. This provided us with the unique opportunity to investigate whether the number and types of intrusion errors differed as a function of an individual’s self-reported ethnic background. The analyses did not reveal any differences between European Americans and Hispanics across diagnostic groups. Furthermore, as some Hispanics preferred to be evaluated in English, testing language was additionally added to the analysis and indicated no significant differences. Considering the LASSI-L is validated for use with Hispanic older adults (Curiel et al., 2017), these findings are not surprising. However, they successfully demonstrated the strength of this paradigm when used in a culturally heterogeneous sample of Hispanics and non- Hispanics, which is relevant in South Florida.

Amyloid load and Intrusion Errors

Significant positive correlations emerged between the total number of intrusion errors and amyloid load, as well as between each of the three types of intrusion errors and amyloid load. The strongest positive correlations were found between amyloid load with the total number of intrusion errors on the LASSI-L, and with the number of SRI. These correlations suggest that deficits in the semantic networks typically associated with more advanced stages of neurodegenerative diseases which lead to the production of SRI are related to mean SUVR.

Limitations and future directions

The categories of intrusion errors used were sufficient in classifying all intrusion errors made by the sample on the LASSI-L, however, there is a level of ambiguity in this classification; certain words could be interpreted as phonemically related (sounding like words from the test; e.g., lemon), or as belonging to a superordinate category (e.g., recalling the word ‘fruits’). Future research may benefit by adding additional categories for greater detail about the types of intrusion errors.

The dementia group included individuals who met criteria for clinical AD, and the majority had evidence of AD brain pathophysiological processes, increasing the validity of an AD etiology (McKhann et al, 2011). However, four individuals did not show positive AD-related biomarkers. The results from the dementia sample may be therefore generalized to the profile of AD patients, however, these results should be interpreted with caution and verified with a larger sample comprised exclusively of AD individuals. Other studies (Rouleau et al., 2001) compared intrusion errors in AD patients compared with individuals with dementia with frontal lobe semiology (FD) and non-demented Parkinson’s patients (PD). Their results suggest that unrelated intrusion errors occurred more often in AD and FD patients compared with PD patients. Our AD sample did not differ in the number of UI relative to the other groups, a discrepancy which may be explained by the nature of the tests used. The Rouleau et al. (2001) study used the RAVLT, which includes five recall trials of the first list, and only one trial of the second list. The LASSI-L provides an equal number of learning trials for both lists. Therefore, it is possible that the low rate of UI in our study was masked by a greater number of CLI and SRI. Furthermore, when comparing AD and Semantic Dementia SD patients, Vallet et al. (2017) found that intrusion errors (any word that was not part of the target items) only occurred in the AD sample. However, these intrusion errors could include those we classified as SRI or UI, therefore, the typical patterns of errors in an AD sample still require further examination and a more objective definition of what qualifies as an UI.

Differences in the number of individuals belonging to each diagnostic and ethnic group, as well as the overrepresentation of females are a limitation to the generalizability of these results. The sample included fewer cases of dementia than any other diagnostic group. Additionally, 63% of the sample was Hispanic. Therefore, the results of the dementia group and the ethnicity analyses should be interpreted with caution and should be confirmed with a larger sample.

The LASSI-L is validated and shows high sensitivity in detecting early cognitive changes (Curiel et al., 2013; Crocco et al., 2014). Nonetheless, results should be compared with other verbal memory tests that have been administered to larger samples and include recognition trials. Russo et al. (2017) reported that including recognition trials on verbal memory tests was a strong predictor of conversion from aMCI and AD over two years. Therefore, including tests which can evaluate the participants’ discriminability can provide additional information regarding conversion to AD.

While the LASSI-L was translated to Spanish by proficient Spanish speakers and has been validated for use in the diagnosing of aMCI with a sample of Hispanic individuals, certain items have more than one translation, and this varies across and within countries. For example, the word ‘banana’ was translated to ‘banana’, however, Spanish speakers from several Latin American countries refer to this as ‘banano’, ‘guineo’, ‘cambur’, or ‘plátano’. This issue occurs with other words such as ‘medias’, ‘fresa’, ‘piña’, ‘chaqueta’, ‘cinturón’, ‘pantalón’, ‘naranja’, ‘melocotón’ and ‘armónica’, which are also known as ‘calcetines’, ‘frutilla’, ‘ananas’, ‘chamarra’ or ‘cazadora’, ‘correa’ or ‘cinto’, ‘pantalones’, ‘china’, ‘durazno’ or ‘albaricoque’ and ‘dulzaina’ or ‘sinfonía’, respectively. Although these variations occurred infrequently in our sample, a test designed for Spanish speakers would ideally include words that are more universal across regions and countries to minimize the production of synonymous words that would be considered incorrect.

Lastly, during the administration of the LASSI-L, participants were not corrected when intrusion errors were made. The same errors were therefore often repeated across trials, even after a second presentation of the words. These perseverations may reflect a different mechanism than deficits in the inhibitory process. Davis, Price, Kaplan, and Libon (2002) analyzed these perseverative errors and concluded that, compared with patients with Ischaemic Vascular Dementia, dementia patients made repeated intrusion errors across trials more often. The researchers suggest that these perseverations might be unique to the amnestic presentation of dementia. Future research should quantify perseverations of intrusion errors to explore this type of error.

Our sample included European Americans and Hispanics, however, specific linguistic variables, such as language proficiency, age of acquisition, and levels of bilingualism were not examined. It is possible that the interaction of these factors could play a role in mediating the number and type of intrusions, and therefore, this should be further explored.

Conclusions

CLI and SRI showed differences between the CN and aMCI groups, with the aMCI group evidencing a higher rate of these intrusion errors compared with the CN group. These findings add to the existing literature about the LASSI-L’s sensitivity at the earliest stages of abnormal aging, which have been supported by imaging results (Crocco et al., 2014, 2018).

Another contribution of the current study was obtained when comparing intrusion errors on free and cued recall trials; differences only emerged when analyzing the types of intrusion errors, not the total intrusion errors. CLI and SRI occurred more often during cued recall trials than free recall trials, and only the aMCI group increased the number of SRI during Cued B1 (sensitive to PSI), perhaps signaling deficient semantic networks. Furthermore, amyloid load was positively correlated to all types of intrusion errors, particularly to SRI. Our results are consistent with previous analyses using the LASSI-L with a sample of Hispanic individuals, suggesting that this test is valid with Spanish speaking individuals, regardless of the chosen language of evaluation.

Public Significance Statements

This paper contributes to the understanding of the characteristics of memory decline during normal and abnormal aging.

Analyses of the types of intrusion errors in a word list interference task are presented in English and Spanish speakers.

The analyses presented in this manuscript, particularly semantically related intrusions, could help clinicians differentiate between amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment and normal aging.
