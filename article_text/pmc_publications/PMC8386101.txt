Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Here we describe the application of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) for the characterization of the interactions between tau and polyphosphate, an intracellular polymer that accelerates tau aggregation. We describe the design of tau constructs, purification and fluorescent labeling of tau, and details of acquisition and analysis of smFRET data. The protocols provided here outline an approach that may be applied to the study of other intrinsically disordered proteins and their binding partners.

1 Introduction

It is estimated that &gt;40% of the mammalian proteome can be classified as being entirely intrinsically disordered or containing disordered domains [1]. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are generally enriched in charged and polar residues, with relatively low fractions of hydrophobic residues, and do not form stable secondary or tertiary structures in isolation [2]. Despite their lack of stable structure, IDPs are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including signaling pathways [3] and membraneless organelles [4], as well as being implicated in a number of diseases [5]. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a powerful approach for characterizing heterogenous conformational states of IDPs. FRET is the non-radiative transfer of energy via a dipole-dipole mechanism from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore [6]. The efficiency of transfer, ETeff, is strongly dependent on the distance between the fluorophores [7]. When both fluorophores are placed on the same protein, it serves as a useful probe of conformational changes as a function of measurement conditions. Intramolecular smFRET has been used to gain insight into unfolded states of globular proteins [8], the role of disorder in allosteric regulation [9], conformational states of disordered proteins involved in phase separation [10], and high affinity interactions of disordered proteins in complexes [11].

Tau is an intrinsically disordered microtubule-associated protein that is implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies [12]. While fibrillar aggregates of tau are the hallmark of these diseases, the molecular mechanisms relevant to the initiation of tau aggregation are not well understood. Tau does not aggregate readily in vitro, and as such, aggregation is often studied in the presence of anionic molecules such as heparin, arachidonic acid, or polyphosphate [13–16]. The low protein concentrations (~pM) used in diffusion-based smFRET measurements disfavor aggregation, making intramolecular smFRET particularly useful for characterizing domain-specific conformational changes relevant to tau aggregation in the monomer protein.

3 Methods

3.1 PEG-PLL

Dissolve PLL hydrobromide in a 50 mM borate buffer (pH 8.5) to make 2.5 mL of a 40 mg/mL solution; vortex for 30 min.

Rinse a 0.22 μm filter with borate buffer and filter the PLL solution. Add the PLL solution to 250 mg mPEG-SPA-2 kDa powder to a final PEG concentration of 100 mg/mL.

Vortex the solution and incubate it in the dark for 6 h at room temperature.

Place the solution in 7 kDa MW dialysis tubing and dialyze overnight against 2 L of water. The PEG-PLL solution will increase in volume 4–6× during dialysis.

Aliquot the PEG-PLL for storage at −20 °C.

3.2 smFRET Standards

Dissolve the DNA to 2 μM in 100 μL of oligo hybridization buffer in a microcentrifuge tube.

Cover the tube in aluminum foil to prevent exposure to light.

Heat approximately 1 L of water until boiling; then remove from the heat.

Submerge the DNA reaction in the water and leave to cool overnight with stirring.

Aliquot the reaction and store at 4 °C for regular use or −20 °C for long-term storage.

3.3 Design of Tau Constructs for smFRET Measurements

Tau has four main functional domains (Fig. 3): the N-terminal domain (NTD: with inserts N1 and N2), the proline rich region (PRR), the microtubule binding region (MTBR: with three or four conserved repeat sequences, R1, R2, R3 and R4), and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Tau is found as six naturally occurring isoforms resulting from alternative splicing of the two N-terminal inserts (0 N, 1 N and 2 N) and the second repeat, R2, of the MTBR (3R vs. 4R).

Because IDPs like tau often exhibit domain-specific, non-cooperative behavior, a single set of labeling sites may not be sufficient to capture all relevant conformational changes [13, 17, 22]. To address this challenge, our strategy is to label the protein at multiple sets of independent and overlapping sites. This allows us to probe tau domains within the context of the full-length protein. To illustrate, in the full-length protein we place labels at positions spanning the MTBR as well as spanning the PRR-MTBR (Fig. 3) to determine the relationship between the two domains. We may also probe the properties of these domains in isolation in order to understand the impact of flanking regions on their properties, e.g., a fragment consisting only of the MTBR or of the PRR-MTBR (Fig. 3) [18].

3.3.1 Introduction of Cysteines for Labeling

Unless they are to be used for labeling, native cysteines at residues 291 and 322 in the tau isoforms containing all four repeats are mutated to serine using site-directed mutagenesis.

Pairs of cysteines residues are introduced by site-directed mutagenesis to span the different domains of interest (see Notes 5 and 6). To illustrate, we mutated residues Q244 and E372 (Fig. 3) to cysteines to incorporate fluorophores, which allow for probing the MTBR.

3.3.2 Creation of Tau Isoforms and Fragments

To investigate the behavior of the isolated domains, fragments are cloned from the full-length tau plasmid.

For both isoforms and fragments, the construct plasmids are made by deleting the necessary nucleotides from the full-length plasmid.

3.4 Tau Expression and Purification

Transform tau into BL21 cells. Add ~50–100 ng of plasmid to 50 μL of cells and incubate on ice for 30 min. Heat shock the cells at 42 °C for 45 s and incubate on ice for 2 min. Add 450 μL of LB media and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Pipette ~100 μL onto a LB/agar/ampicillin plates and spread evenly with sterile spreader. Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.

Select a single colony for inoculation of a 5 mL starter culture (LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin final concentration added just prior to growth). Incubate the starter culture overnight and then add it to a larger volume of LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The volume of the LB cultures for protein expression varies; typically, 1 L is used for full-length constructs, while 0.5 L is used for fragments.

Incubate the large volume LB culture for ~4 h at 37 °C with shaking to reach OD = 0.4–0.6 at 600 nm. Add IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce protein expression. Let the culture continue to grow with shaking either 4 h at 37 °C or overnight at 16 °C (see Note 7).

Pellet the cells and resuspend the pellet in 30 mL Lysis Buffer per 1 L of LB. Lysed cells can be stored at −80 °C until needed.

Thaw the sample and sonicate on ice for 100 s with a 1 s pulse followed by 2 s of rest at a maximum power of ~35 W.

Centrifuge the cells at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the pellet.

Filter the supernatant with a 0.22 μm filter to remove any residual cell debris. For full-length tau, all of the following steps should be carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated to minimize degradation of the protein (see Note 8).

Remove excess buffer from the nickel affinity column resin, and mix with filtered supernatant in a 50 mL conical tube. Incubate for 45–60 min with gentle mixing.

Pour the resin into a 10 mL volume column, and allow it to settle and drain excess solution; wash the column with 5 mL additional Buffer A.

Step-elute the protein in ~15 mL Buffer B, collecting all 15 mL.

Concentrate the 15 mL sample to ~2 mL and buffer exchange into Buffer A (~30 mL buffer total) using an Amicon centrifugal filter unit with the appropriate cut off (10 kDa for full-length and 3 kDa for fragments) to reduce the imidazole concentration (see Note 9).

To cleave the His-tag, add DTT to a final concentration of 1 mM, followed by ~1 mg/mL TEV protease. Incubate overnight at 4 °C or for 3–4 h at room temperature with gentle shaking.

Remove DTT by buffer exchange with a total volume ~30 mL into Buffer A using an Amicon filter unit.

As in step 8, incubate with the nickel affinity column material equilibrated in Buffer A for 45–60 min with gentle shaking.

Pour the resin into the column and collect the column flow-through, which will contain the cleaved tau; uncleaved tau, cleaved His-tag, and TEV protease will all be retained on the column beads. Rinse the conical tube with an additional ~5 mL buffer. Add this to the column bed and collect with original flow-through.

Concentrate the protein sample to ~1 mL and buffer exchange into Buffer C with a total volume of ~30 mL using an Amicon filter unit (see Note 10).

Remove all remaining contaminants by passing the protein over a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 size exclusion column.

Detect and analyze the purity of the protein through SDS-PAGE of the fractions collected from the size exclusion column (see Note 11).

Concentrate the protein to ~2 mL, and buffer exchange the pure protein into FRET buffer with a total volume of ~30 mL. Either label the protein immediately (Subheading 3.5) or aliquot it and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80 °C (see Note 12).

Determine the yield of the protein by absorbance at 280 nm (see Notes 13 and 14).

3.5 Labeling Tau for smFRET Measurements

Starting with the protein from step 19 of Subheading 3.4, add DTT to a final concentration of 1 mM at room temperature and incubate for ~30 min.

Add ~10 mL Labeling Buffer and then concentrate the sample in an Amicon filter unit to a final volume of ~500 μL. The tau concentration should be around 100 μM (see Note 15).

Transfer the protein to a small, clean glass vial (2 mL vial with a flat bottom); and add the donor dye, Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide, at a 2:1 protein:dye ratio. Cover with aluminum foil to protect the sample from light, and incubate for 1 h at room temperature with stirring.

Add the acceptor dye, Alexa Fluor 594 maleimide, to 5× molar excess of the protein, cover with foil, and move to 4 °C. Continue incubation with stirring overnight.

Remove the GdnHCl and some of the unreacted dye by buffer exchange with ~15 mL FRET Buffer using an Amicon filter unit. Concentrate the sample to 500 μL.

Remove any remaining unreacted dye by passing the solution over two coupled HiTrap Desalting Columns equilibrated with FRET buffer. Coupling the desating columns results in better separation of the labeled protein from unreacted dye. Labeled tau elutes between 2.5 and 3 mL.

Flash freeze ~30 μL aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store at −80 °C. (see Notes 16 through 20).

3.6 Preparation of Coverslips

Measurements are made in Nunc Lab-Tek eight-well chambered borosilicate coverslips.

Dilute the PEG-PLL in Millipore water. We generally use a 1:40 dilution of the preparation described in Subheading 3.1.

Treat the coverslips for 1 min in a plasma cleaner on high.

Immediately add 300 μL of the diluted PEG-PLL into each well, and let incubate overnight at room temperature.

The following morning, rinse the coverslips 8–10 times with Millipore water.

Fill the chambers with water and incubate for ~3 h to overnight. Chambers should be stored filled with water until they are needed for measurements. (see Notes 21 and 22).

Replace the water in one well with 200–250 μL of the appropriate sample for measurements, leaving remaining wells filled with water until needed for measurement.

3.7 Checking Alignment by Measuring Diffusion Times of Fluorescent Standards

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) can be used to measure the diffusion time of fluorescently labeled molecules [19]. The diffusion time is very sensitive to the instrument settings, including alignment of the lasers, fibers/pinholes, and filter. As such, measuring the diffusion time of a well-characterized fluorescent sample on a daily basis is a robust means of ensuring that the instrument is aligned and all components are functioning. We use Alexa 488 hydrazide and eGFP at 20 nM as reference fluorophores for this purpose (see Note 23). The 50 μm aperture optical fibers are used to couple the fluorescence emission to the avalanche photo diode detectors for FCS measurements (Fig. 1).

Adjust the laser power to 5 μW just prior to entering the microscope.

Collect ten measurements of 10 s each of the reference fluorescence standards. The autocorrelation curves are generated by the digital correlator.

Average the ten autocorrelation curves and fit the average curve, G(τ), to Eq. 1 which describes diffusion in three-dimensions of a single fluorescent species: (1) G(τ)=1N×11+ττD×11+s2ττD

where N is the average number of molecules in the focal volume, s is the ratio of radial to axial dimensions of the focused laser, τ is the time axis, and τD is the translational diffusion time of the fluorescent molecule.

The fit parameters N and τD and the counts-per-molecule (total intensity signal of the sample divided by N) should fall within the standard deviation of the over-time values of these parameters.

3.8 Calibrate Instrument with smFRET Standards

Following alignment, smFRET positive controls that span a range of ETeff values are measured to ensure day-to-day reproducibility of smFRET measurements. We use fluorescently labeled double-stranded DNA (Subheadings 2.1.2 and 3.2). The 100 μm aperture optical fibers are used to couple the fluorescence emission to the avalanche photo diode detectors for all smFRET measurements.

Adjust the laser power to 30 μW prior to entering the microscope.

Dilute the smFRET standard to ~30 pM in 250 μL of FRET buffer.

Collect a 10 min (1 ms bin size) intensity trace.

From this trace, calculate ETeff values, plot as a histogram, and fit as described below in Subheading 3.10. For any given day, the peak ETeff value from fitting the histogram should fall within the standard deviation of the over-time peak ETeff values.

3.9 SmFRET Measurements of Tau

Collect a 1 min intensity trace (1 ms bin size) of the buffer. This serves as a measure of the background intensity for the sample. Under ideal circumstances, analysis of this trace as described below (Subheading 3.10) should show that no FRET events were recorded (Fig. 2).

Add ~25–50 pM labeled tau to the measurement well. This is on the order of two 1000× dilutions of the thawed tau aliquots from Subheading 3.5.

Mix by pipetting 3–4 times.

Collect a 1 min intensity trace (1 ms bins size). Analyze the trace as described in Subheading 3.8. We typically expect 100–300 FRET events per minute. Even after only 1 min, analysis should show two peaks in the ETeff histogram: (a) one that has an average ETeff = 0, corresponding to events from protein with two donor fluorophores or a donor fluorophore and an inactive acceptor fluorophore; and (b) a second peak that corresponds to tau with an active donor and active acceptor.

If the analyzed data looks as described in step 4, collect a time trace of 30–60 min (Fig. 2) (see Notes 24 and 25).

3.10 Analysis of smFRET Data

As described in Subheading 3.9, intensity traces are collected in 1 ms time bins. Apply a minimum photon-per-event threshold to discriminate between signal and noise [20]. This can be done empirically, by increasing the threshold value until no events are detected in the background measurements (Subheading 3.9, step 1). Alternatively, it can be done by comparing the number of events obtained from photon traces of buffer in the absence and presence of tau over a range of threshold values, selecting a threshold value that gives the highest ratio of protein:buffer events [20]. For our measurements, we sum the photons in the donor and acceptor channels before applying a threshold. For the measurement conditions described here, we typically use a threshold between 30 and 50 photons/bin; all bins with fewer than the threshold number of photons are removed from the data set for further analysis.

Using the filtered data set, the ETeff for each time-bin is calculated as: (2) ETeff=(Ia−Ba)−β(Id−Bd)((Ia−Ba)−β(Id−Bd))+γ((Id−Bd)+β(Id−Bd))

where Ia and Id are the intensities in the acceptor and donor channels, respectively; Ba and Bd are the average background intensities of the acceptor and donor channels, respectively, measured in Subheading 3.9, step 1; β is the bleed-through of donor fluorescence into the acceptor channel and γ corrects for the difference in quantum yields of the fluorophores and quantum efficiencies of the detectors. (see Notes 26 and 27).

Plot the resultant ETeff values as a histogram. As described in step 4 of Subheading 3.9, histograms will always consist of two peaks, one corresponding to the ETeff = 0 peak and the other corresponding to tau labeled with both a donor and an acceptor. Fit the histograms with a sum of two Gaussian distributions to determine the peak ETeff values and the widths using Eq. 3. (3) y=A1w1π/2e−2(x−x1w1)2+A2w2π/2e−2(x−x2w2)2

where An is the integrated area under the peak, wn is the standard deviation and xn is the center of the peak.

3.11 SmFRET Measurements with polyP or Other Aggregation Inducers

Dilute polyP to 250 μM to 1 mM in Phosphate Buffer and add the appropriate volume to a measurement well (see Note 28).

Measure a 1 min intensity trace of the polyP solution. Analyze this trace as described above in Subheading 3.10 using a threshold determined for buffer in the absence of polyP as a starting point. Ideally, this analysis should not yield any events that exceed the threshold (see Note 29).

Add labeled tau, pipette 3–4 times to mix and repeat steps 4–5 from Subheading 3.9.

Depending on the goal of the experiments, it may be desirable to carry out measurements over a range of polyP concentrations. Often, we make comparative measurements between tau isoforms or for different labeling positions under “saturating” conditions, meaning that adding more polyP does not cause additional changes to the ETeff histograms (Fig. 4). The concentration of polyP that results in “saturation” may differ for different chain lengths of polyP, for different tau isoforms or fragments or even for labeling positions reporting on different tau domains. These measurements may result in an additional peak in the histogram plots. As described above, in addition to the ETeff = 0 and tau in buffer peaks, there will be a peak due to tau with polyP bound (Fig. 3 and 4). If this is the case, an additional Gaussian distribution should be included in the fitting protocol (see Note 30).

Similar measurements can be carried out with other aggregation inducers such as heparin [13], RNA or lipid vesicles or with any binding partner.

4 Notes

Recombinant eGFP is also available commercially from various suppliers.

We have used polyP provided by Prof. U. Jakob (University of Michigan) through Dr. T Shiba (RegeneTiss, Japan). Commerical sources are available (Kerafast).

The average chain lengths are determined through polyP gel electrophoresis based on the negative staining method of Smith and Morrissey [21]. The polyP concentration can be determined using a Toluidine blue assay against a phosphorous standard curve.

We order fluorescently labeled ssDNA from IDT. An example sequence for our 10mer standard is as shown here: 3′-CGG ATC TCG G-Alexa 488-5′.

3′-CCG AGA TCC G-Alexa 594-5′.

The fluorophore can be placed at either the 3′ or the 5′ end, so long as the complimentary strand has the label at the same end. Site-directed mutagenesis can be carried out by Overlap Extension PCR or whole plasmid, single-round PCR [23]. We use QuikChange Site-Directed mutagenesis kits, which employ the second method of mutagenesis.

A smFRET measurement of the protein alone should result in a single (other than the ETeff = 0 peak), shot-noise limited peak in the ETeff histogram. Significant broadening or deviation from the expected peak position may mean that one or both of the fluorophores is interacting non-randomly with the protein. In this case, different labeling positions or fluorophores should be evaluated.

Tau fragments (i.e., the MTBR or PRR) are generally expressed at 37 °C for 4 h, while the full-length protein is expressed overnight at 16 °C. Full-length tau can be grown at 37 °C with a decrease in the final yield due to increased protein degradation.

Tau fragments express at a higher yield and are less prone to degradation than the full-length constructs. If desired, purification of the fragments may be carried out at room temperature without a significant loss of yield or purity.

To maximize the yield of the protein, rinse the membranes of the Amicon concentrators, collecting the rinse buffer, following use. This removes some of the protein that has adsorbed to the membranes.

Tau can precipitate if the sample is concentrated too much at this stage, so care should be taken to not concentrate the sample to the point of precipitation. Typically, we aim for a volume of ~1 mL, although this varies depending on the yield of the purification.

As is true for many IDPs, tau runs at a larger molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE gels than its actual molecular weight. For example, the MTBR construct, which is 176 residues long and has a molecular weight = 18.4 kDa, runs at ~25 kDa on a 4–12% acrylamide gel.

Repeated freeze-thawing tau may compromise its integrity and is therefore not recommended. Aliquot the protein in convenient volumes for a single set of planned experiments.

The molar extinction coefficient for full-length tau is 7450 cm−1 M−1. The MTBR fragment has a molar extinction coefficient of 1490 cm−1 M−1. The extinction coefficients can be calculated using ProtParam or any similar protein sequence tools. For IDPs lacking any aromatic residues, we have found that a Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay works well for quantification.

Our yield at this stage is approximately 2–5 mg of tau per 0.5–1 L growth.

While a higher concentration of tau (~100 μM as recommended above) generally results in a higher labeling efficiency, concentrations as low as ~40 μM have been used successfully.

Labeling as described here does not allow for site-specific conjugation of the donor and acceptor fluorophores to the cysteines. More precisely, labeled proteins will be a mix of donor at site A, acceptor at site B; donor at site B, acceptor at site A; donor at sites A and B; acceptor at sites A and B. If site-specific conjugation of the fluorophores is desired, then a combination of a cysteine and an unnatural amino acid provide orthogonal chemical reactivities that can achieve this [24].

Pairs of donor-acceptor dye are chosen to best cover the expected distance between the two probes or to match the requirements of the instrument, i.e., available laser excitation wavelengths. Alexa 488 and Alexa 594 have a theoretical Ro = 60Å; however, the actual R0 is dependent upon the quantum yield and emission of the donor fluorophore. Therefore, R0 may be sensitive to the labeling positions, solution conditions, etc., and should be experimentally determined for each labeled protein construct if accurate distance calculations are desired [25].

Because tau adsorbs to the walls of the microcentrifuge tubes used for storage, maintaining the protein at a high concentration during storage and until use minimizes loss. We generally avoid diluting the protein below ~1–2 μM prior to addition to the measurement chambers.

The labeled protein should be subjected to a functional assay to ensure that the labels do not significantly perturb its properties. For tau, aggregation of the labeled protein measured by light scattering [26], Thioflavin T fluorescence [27] or anisotropy of the acceptor fluorophore [28] and compared to unlabeled protein under the same conditions is a reasonable proxy for a functional assay.

Mass spectrometry is a useful approach for ensuring that a majority of the protein samples have two fluorophores conjugated.

Coverslips may be stored filled with water for approximately one week. Some tau variants are more likely to adsorb to the Nunc chamber surfaces than other.

Inhomogeneities in the PEG-PLL coating of the coverslips can result in inconsistent measurements or ETeff histograms that do not show evidence of distinct populations or loss of signal due to protein adsorption or precipitation. There may be well-to-well variability of the PEG-PLL coating and in some cases simply making a fresh sample in a new well will resolve issues. Alternatively, unlabeled tau can be used to passivate the sample chambers before the addition of labeled tau and/or polyP. However, this may complicate measurements where precise protein concentrations are required.

Any bright fluorophore that fits a single-component diffusion equation (Eq. 1) that can be excited by the donor fluorophore laser can be used as an alignment standard for FCS. A few examples include other Alexa Fluor dyes and rhodamine 6 G.

The number of events of the measurement should be monitored as a function of time. If there is significant loss of events, this usually reflects precipitation of the protein or adsorption to the sample chamber. A slight decrease in the number of events over time may be expected, especially for samples containing binding partners. A loss of ~20% is not problematic, if analysis of events collected early in the run and those collected later in the run yield comparable results. A measurement should be aborted if peaks are not distinguishable and the histogrammed data appears relatively featureless from ETeff = 0–1.

In assessing our data, we often compare peak ETeff values obtained by fitting the histograms as described here. However, if one wishes to calculate distances based on the peak ETeff values, there are a number of polymer models appropriate for IDPs that may be solved numerically for this purpose [29].

β corrects for fluorescence from the donor fluorophore that is detected by the acceptor photodiode. We typically determine this on a daily basis. Use a 20 nM solution of Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide; collect a 60 s intensity trace in both the donor and acceptor detectors. Calculate β as (4) β=IaIa+Id

where Ia = intensity of acceptor channel and Id = intensity of donor channel. For our instrument, typical values of β vary between 6% and 8% of the sum of intensities from both channels. However, β remains fairly stable for a system that does not undergo major realignments.

γ accounts for differences in the quantum yields of the donor and the acceptor fluorophores, the use of bandpass filters that select only a portion of emitted photons and differences in the quantum efficiencies of the detectors: (5) γ=naϕandϕd

where na and nd are the detection efficiency of the acceptor and donor detectors, respectively, and øa and ød are the quantum yield of acceptor and donor fluorophores, respectively [30]. We typically determine γ every 3–4 months. To do so, make stock concentrations of Alexa Fluor 488 hydrazide and Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide with equal absorbances at the wavelength of donor excitation (488 nm for our example). Make serial dilutions of each dye solution. Dilute the initial solutions equally—the acceptor sample will be much more concentrated than the donor sample, as its fluorescence when excited at the donor wavelength is much less. Measure fluorescence intensities of the dyes on the smFRET instrument using low laser power, as these solutions are much higher concentration (μM) than those used for smFRET. Plot of the intensities of the Alexa 594 fluorescence on the y-axis versus the Alexa 488 fluorescence on the x axis. The slope of a straight line fit to this data is γ. Values of γ will be dependent upon the exact components of the instrument; on our systems, typical values of γ are from 1 to 1.4.

PolyP samples should only be subjected to a few freeze-thaw cycles. Therefore it is useful to have many aliquots of polyP at concentrations convenient for only one or two sets of measurements.

Some binding partners increase the background signal over buffer and a higher threshold may be required.

For labeling positions, which give rise to low peak ETeff values (&lt;0.2), it may not be possible to distinguish events arising from donor-acceptor labeled protein from the ETeff = 0 peak using an instrument as described here (Fig. 4). Alternating laser excitation (ALEX) [31, 32] or pulsed interleaving excitation (PIE) [33] uses a second laser to directly excite the acceptor fluorophore. Measurements are made with switching between the donor and acceptor excitation lasers and correlating the detected photons with the appropriate excitation pulse. This allows for discrimination of true low ETeff events from donor-acceptor labeled protein (which will have a signal when directly excited by the acceptor laser) and ETeff = 0 events from donor-only labeled protein (which will not have a signal when excited by the acceptor laser).

Fig. 1 Schematic of components of an smFRET instrument. The cartoon of the focused laser with all parts labeled shows a donor-acceptor labeled molecule diffusing through it, giving rise to a “burst” of photons in both the donor (green) and acceptor (red) channels as shown in the time trace below it. Representative traces of a donor-labeled-only sample (bursts in the detector channel only) and an acceptor-labeled-only sample (no bursts detected) are also illustrated on the time trace

Fig. 2 Examples of photon traces of 1 min background (a) and protein (b) measurements with 1 ms time binds. Data are shown with the donor photon counts (green) stacked on top of the acceptor photon counts (red) so that the total photon counts per 1 ms time bin can be read from the plot. The dashed lines indicate the intensity threshold for a burst, 30 photons in the sum of the donor and acceptor channels, to qualify as a FRET event. The intensity traces are analyzed, and the ETeff values are plotted as histograms after 1 (c), 10 (d), and 60 (e) minutes of data collection. The number of events in each histogram is indicated

Fig. 3 Schematic of tau with functional domains marked (a). SmFRET histograms of tau constructs in the absence (dark gray, dashed lines) and presence (light gray, solid lines) of saturating concentrations of polyP of chain length 300. The left-hand column shows probes of different domains in the same construct: NTD (b), PRR and MTBR (c), and CTD (d). The right-hand column shows probes of the same domain—the MTBR—in different constructs: full-length tau (e), a fragment with part of the PRR and the MTBR (f), and the isolated MTBR (g).

Fig. 4 Titration of polyP of chain length 300 into tau. With increasing polyP concentration (as indicated), the low ETeff peak corresponding to tau in buffer shrinks, concurrent with the appearance of a higher ETeff peak from tau with polyP bound. These plots illustrate the challenges of accurately measuring low ETeff events arising from donor-acceptor labeled protein from the artifactual ETeff = 0 peak. The area under the peaks was used to calculate an apparent KD ≈ 0.4 μM. The data for the histograms marked with an asterisk were acquired in PIE-FRET (see Note 30) to eliminate the ETeff = 0 peak. The red lines are the Gaussian fits for each peak (see Subheading 3.10, step 3). (Figure adapted with permission from [17])
