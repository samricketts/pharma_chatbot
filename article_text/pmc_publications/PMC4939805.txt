Purpose of review

There has been recent debate about the lack of compelling scientific evidence on the efficacy of cognitive interventions. The goal of this paper is to review the current state of cognitive interventions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), present emerging mechanisms, and discuss the role of imaging in designing effective intervention strategies.

Recent findings

Cognitive interventions appear to be promising in AD and PD. Though feasibility has been shown in mild cognitive impairment, early AD, mild to moderate PD; studies to investigate long term efficacy and mechanisms underlying these interventions are still needed.

Summary

There is a need to conduct scientifically rigorous studies to validate the efficacy of cognitive intervention trials. Future studies will greatly benefit from including longitudinal imaging in their study design. Imaging can be used to demonstrate the efficacy and mechanisms by measuring brain changes over the intervention period. Imaging can also be used to determine biological and disease-related factors that may influence the treatment response i.e. the effect modifiers. Consideration of effect modifiers will allow us to measure the treatment response in biomarkers and cognition with greater sensitivity and also aid in designing trials that will lead to better patient outcomes.

Introduction

The world population is aging at an accelerated rate. With increasing life expectancy, more people will be diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). These diseases are characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain that are tied into specific clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits. Cognitive Deficits in AD: The primary pathological causes of AD are neuritic plaques composed of β-amyloid fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (1). These pathologies cause neurodegeneration typically but not always beginning in the medial temporal lobes. Though early cognitive deficits are related to memory; decline is seen in all cognitive domains as the disease progresses (2–4). Cognitive Deficits in PD: The primary pathological causes of PD are Lewy bodies which are mainly composed of alpha-synuclein (5). Though PD is primarily characterized by progressive worsening of motor symptoms, cognitive impairment, executive dysfunction in particular, is a common aspect (6–8). In those with PD progressing to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (typically multi-domain non-amnestic) and dementia, visuospatial, working memory, language, and learning and recall deficits are additionally observed (9).

Observational studies in AD and PD have provided evidence that non-pharmacological or behavioural changes are associated with better disease courses (10). While there is emerging evidence that cognitive interventions may provide neuroprotective, neurorestorative, and secondary prevention benefits, there has been debate about the lack of compelling scientific evidence backing their effectiveness (11–15). The goal of this work is to review the current state of cognitive interventions in AD and PD, present emerging mechanisms, and discuss the role of imaging in designing intervention trials.

Cognitive Interventions: Existing Literature and Emerging Mechanisms

Cognitive interventions can be divided into cognitive stimulation, cognitive training, and cognitive rehabilitation. Cognitive stimulation engages participants in a range of general activities and discussions; and is commonly conducted in groups. It aims at general enhancement of cognitive and social functioning. Cognitive training focuses on guided practice on a set of tasks that reflect particular cognitive functions, such as memory, attention or problem-solving or offers instruction and practice of mnemonic approaches such as the method of loci or visual imagery (i.e. strategy training). Cognitive rehabilitation intends to identify and address the individuals needs and goals, which may require strategies for taking in new information or compensatory methods such as using memory aids (13).

This section reviews the existing literature on cognitive interventions in AD and PD and possible mechanisms. In addition to cognitive intervention studies, we have included literature from the field of cognitive reserve (CR) which is often used to explain the inter-subject variability in cognitive performance in the face of brain pathology (16). Cognitive intervention is suggested to increase an individual’s CR (16) and therefore mechanistic interpretations associated with higher vs. lower CR are generalizable to mechanisms invoked through cognitive interventions.

Cognitive Interventions in AD

Cognitive stimulation consistently improves global cognition, primarily in individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia (15, 17). These benefits appear to be over and above any medication effects and remained evident at three months follow-up. Significant benefits were also noted for quality of life and well-being, and on clinical staff ratings of communication and social interaction. No effects were found for mood, activities of daily living or challenging behaviour (15, 17) (Table 1). However, cognitive training did not result in any statistically significant effects in any domain for early stages of AD (12, 13). Cognitive rehabilitation may be promising for self-rated competence and satisfaction in performing meaningful personal goals, memory capacity and general quality of life in AD patients (12). For general quality of life, these effects persisted six months after the intervention (12). However, the authors stated that more studies are required to obtain definitive evidence (Table 1). In MCI, cognitive training resulted in small benefits for episodic memory and other cognitive functions (18, 19), although there is debate about these effects (14). A recent review concluded that computerized-cognitive training (CCT) may be promising for improving attention and executive functions, and reducing depressive symptoms and anxiety (20). Yet, another recent review concluded that there is not enough evidence to support CCT alone for improvement or maintenance of cognitive function in MCI or AD (21). Cognitive stimulation has been less intensively studied in MCI. Wenisch and colleagues (22) found small benefits for an associative memory paradigm but more studies are needed for definite evidence. Cognitive rehabilitation (14) may be beneficial for subjective measures of cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms (23), while a current review suggested that objective effects on specific cognitive domains were inconsistent across studies (Table 1) (24).

Underlying Mechanisms

In AD, studies in transgenic mice with environmental enrichment have found alteration in behavioral, cellular and molecular aspects of pathogenesis (25). Mice raised with social, physical, and cognitive stimulation showed protection against cognitive impairment, decreased brain β-amyloid deposition, and increased hippocampal synaptic immunoreactivity (26). However, the literature in humans based on CR studies is inconsistent. No effect of CR has been found on the underlying AD pathology (27–29) and CR is also suggested to lower the degree of AD pathologies (30–32). Though the effect of cognitive intervention on AD pathology may be minimal, measuring amyloid and tau levels using CSF and PET imaging during the course of the cognitive interventions will be important in answering this debated question.

There is sufficient evidence to support that brain structure and function differ with CR (33–35). Since plasticity is fundamental to the pathophysiology of AD (36), the possible mechanisms invoked by cognitive interventions may be through brain structure and function (37). Though there is some evidence of transient increase in gray matter with cognitive interventions, there are no studies that have shown the long term maintenance of these neuronal increases (38, 39). Change in neural activity is more common than volumetric increases after cognitive training (39–41). This change can be either activation of new regions, or decreases/increases in neural activity in task related structures (39, 42). Alterations of activity following cognitive training may reflect flexibility in deployment of resources due to strategy change rather than a manifestation of plasticity resulting in an increase in intrinsic neural or cognitive capacity (43). To provide compelling scientific evidence for efficacy of cognitive interventions, measuring brain changes is fundamental in long term trials (44).

Cognitive Interventions in Parkinson’s disease

Despite their clinical efficacy for motor symptoms, anti-parkinsonian medications can negatively impact cognition and behavior (45). Cognitive interventions that provide clinical benefit without detrimental side effects are therefore needed to mitigate disabling non-motor symptoms. Few studies have examined the effects of cognitive intervention in PD and have primarily used cognitive training (Table 1). The combination of cognitive interventions with physical therapies for PD makes it hard to discern the effect of cognitive intervention alone. Cognitive performance was improved on tests of attention, information processing speed, executive functions, semantic verbal fluency, and visuospatial abilities in PD patients who received CCT (46, 47) compared to PD control patients, and in some cases changes were maintained at 6-month follow-up (47). Another study examining the effects of CCT focusing on processing speed in individuals with different subtypes of MCI (48) found that the single-domain, non-amnestic MCI subtype (common in PD) showed the greatest improvement compared to other subtypes or controls and these changes were maintained over 5 years. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of cognitive training in patients with mild to moderate PD (49) found only 7 studies using repeated practice on cognitively challenging tasks of computerized or paper-and-pencil approaches for at least 4 hours. Large and statistically significant effect sizes were found for working memory, processing speed, and executive functioning, but effects sizes were small to negligible and non-significant for memory, attention, visuospatial abilities, depression, quality of life, and activities of daily living.

Underlying Mechanisms

Similar to AD, the mechanism of action maybe through brain structure and function. A recent study by Nombela et al. (50) compared the performance of PD patients and healthy controls on a measure of attention and executive functioning during fMRI and found that performance during “post-treatment” scanning showed that only the PD patients who received training showed improvement on the task (vs. untrained PD and controls), and there were corresponding alterations in brain activation in primarily frontal and parietal areas.

In addition, dopamine levels probably play an important role in PD. Variations in the dopamine (DA) transporter gene (DAT1) appear to be the key in regulating striatal DA availability (51). Some investigators have assessed performance gains across several sessions of working memory training to examine the influence of the DAT1 polymorphism on plasticity (52). Young adults assessed with a cognitive test battery before receiving 20–25 sessions of CCT over 4 weeks on 7 working memory tasks and was found to have improved performance, with larger gains observed in DAT1 9/10-repeat carriers than DAT1 10-repeat carriers. Given the above assumption, larger training gains in DAT 9/10-repeat carriers may be related to lower striatal DAT availability resulting in higher extracellular DA and more active dopaminergic pathways. In normal aging, age-related differences in presynaptic binding potential for the DA transporter as well as postsynaptic receptor densities account for significant portions of the age-related variation in executive functioning, episodic memory, and information processing speed (53–55), and these associations are seen in striatal as well as extrastriatal DA markers (56, 57). Studies have demonstrated that cognitive training may enhance performance on tasks demanding executive functioning in healthy older adults (58, 59) and that executive plasticity is associated with striatal increases of neural activity (60). Working memory underlies executive functioning (61) (i.e., higher-order abilities that underlie skills necessary for performing daily activities and commonly affected in PD). Changes in the basal ganglia and executive-control network, that is, dorsolateral frontal and parietal neocortices, as well as changes in DA receptor density, have been noted following cognitive intervention in non-PD individuals (62).

Role of Imaging in Cognitive Intervention Trials

1. Demonstrating Efficacy and Mechanisms

The key mechanisms of action and efficacy may be demonstrated by measuring the slower rate of brain shrinkage (due to pathology) in individuals undergoing cognitive training vs. those who are not. Additionally, positive neuroplasticity changes in the structural and functional connectivity of the brain (i.e. increased synaptic strengths and synaptogenesis (63)) have been suggested and are supported by CR imaging studies. Several MRI acquisitions can be useful in measuring intervention-related brain structural and functional changes: a) Structural MRI: Recently published methodologies utilize high dimensional normalization between serial MRI scans and require smaller sample sizes to see trajectory changes (64–67). We hypothesize that an effective cognitive intervention may slow the progression of age- and pathology-related atrophy in disease-specific signature regions. b) Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI): White matter plasticity due to long-term practice effects (e.g. professional musicians, early blindness, car racing) (68–71) has been demonstrated using DTI. We hypothesize that cognitive interventions may be successful in attenuating the rapid decline in fractional anisotropy and diffusivity increases seen in AD and PD subjects (72, 73). c) Functional MRI (fMRI): Exercise-induced functional plasticity in large-scale systems in the aging brain over 12 months has been measured (74). In addition to task fMRI, task-free MRI can aid in measuring local and global functional plasticity changes (75, 76). However, the relatively high variability of the method needs to be considered (77). d) Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL): ASL, a perfusion imaging technique, can detect changes in cerebral perfusion with good accuracy (78, 79) and will be useful in capturing intervention related neuronal changes (80–82).

2. Effect Modifiers: Sample Enrichment, Stratification, and Intervention Optimization

Effect modifiers are the main biological and disease-related factors that may influence the treatment response in cognitive intervention trials. Therefore, determining the effect modifiers using molecular, structural, and functional imaging before the start of the intervention would greatly improve the intervention practicability. Increasing age and baseline cognitive status significantly influences the response to cognitive interventions (83, 84). Education levels may also have a significant impact on the response (34). The recent emergence of amyloid imaging in AD has shown that individuals with higher levels of amyloid show diminished practice effects (85, 86), suggesting greater strength of trials in amyloid positive individuals. Another study in individuals with subjective memory impairment predicted response to cognitive training by hippocampal volume (87). They found that larger pre-training hippocampal volumes were related to better verbal delayed recall one week after cognitive training. Further, hippocampal subfield volumetry suggested that the effects on long-term verbal memory change were selective for the left CA2/3 and CA4/DG, which both play a role in episodic memory (87). Effect modifiers impact the overall learning seen in individuals undergoing cognitive training.

Imaging biomarkers can facilitate stratification of patients and/or intervention optimization based on phenotype or genotype. Moreover, enrichment strategies for recruitment to the intervention (that is, including only those most likely to benefit) can improve the response rate. A classic example is the A4 trial where only amyloid positive individuals are recruited to the anti-amyloid treatment trial (88). An example in the context of cognitive intervention is the idea that targeting different memory systems (e.g. episodic memory vs. working memory) will optimize effects for different memory subtypes and in different patient groups. There is definitely a link between a treatment-induced change in the biomarker and the desired clinical outcome measure, as well as a link between the treatment-induced changes in the biomarker and disease process. Therefore, accounting for effect modifiers will aid in measuring the treatment response in biomarkers and cognition with greater sensitivity and designing trials that will lead to better patient outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS

There is a need to conduct scientifically rigorous studies to validate the efficacy of cognitive intervention trials. The availability of imaging technologies for evaluating molecular, structural, and functional imaging changes in the brain has provided us with a unique opportunity to design rigorous cognitive intervention trials. Imaging can play a key role in demonstrating the efficacy and mechanisms underlying cognitive intervention trials. Additionally, imaging can be used to determine effect modifiers and thus improve treatment response through sample enrichment, stratification, and intervention optimization.
