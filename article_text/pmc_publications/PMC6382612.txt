Importance:

Dementia is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but there is little data on dementia treatment patterns or the concomitant use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ACHEI) and anticholinergic medications (ACH), a frank prescribing error.

Objective:

To determine the prevalence of dementia treatment and to quantify and characterize inappropriate administration of a high-potency ACH (ACHhigh) drug and an ACHEI among persons with PD.

Design, Setting and Participants:

This cross-sectional analysis included participants in the U.S. Medicare Prescription Program in 2014 diagnosed with Parkinson Disease.

Main Outcomes/Measures:

Our primary outcomes were (1) prescription fill for a dementia drug (2) concomitant prescription fills for an ACHEI and an ACHhigh drug. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regression models determined the extent to which patient characteristics and comorbid conditions were associated with dementia treatment or with an ACHhigh-ACHEI event.

Results:

268,407 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD met inclusion criteria; 73,093 (27.2%) were prescribed at least one anti-dementia medication. The commonest medication was donepezil (n=46,027; 63.0% of users) followed by memantine (n=30,578, 41.8%), rivastigmine (n=19,278, 26.4%).

Compared to whites, dementia medications were more likely to be prescribed to Blacks (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–1.38) and Hispanics (AOR 1.28, 95%CI 1.22–1.35) and less likely to be prescribed to Native Americans (AOR 0.62, 95%CI 0.51–0.74). Women were less likely to be prescribed a dementia medication (AOR 0.85, 95%CI 0.84–0.87, compared to men).

Of the 64,017 PD patients receiving an ACHEI, 44.5% (n=28,495) had at least one ACHhigh-ACHEI event. Hispanics (AOR 1.11, 95%CI 1.00–1.23) and women (AOR 1.30, 95%CI 1.25–1.35) had greater odds of this ‘never event’. There was statistically significant clustering in the prevalence of this prescribing error (Moran’s I = 0.24; p &lt; 0.001), with clusters of high ACHhigh-ACHEI prevalence in the Southern and Midwestern United States.

Conclusions and Relevance:

Dementia medication use varies by race and sex among persons with PD. Potentially inappropriate prescribing is common among PD patients being treated for cognitive impairment, and varies substantially by race, sex and geography. These data provide national and local targets for improving care quality and outcomes for persons with PD.

Introduction

Among persons with Parkinson disease (PD), cognitive impairment is a major driver of loss of independence, nursing home placement, and health care costs.1–3 One in four PD patients have objective cognitive impairment at the time of diagnosis,4 and the prevalence of dementia in PD (PD+D) reaches 80–90% by twelve years after diagnosis.5 Whereas the literature on the incidence of cognitive impairment in PD is extensive, there is no national data on dementia medication use among U.S. PD patients, and little data on dementia drug use in women or minorities with PD.

While large scale data on dementia medication use is necessary to define the clinical scope of the problem of dementia in PD, identifying patterns of ineffective dementia medication use or reversible contributors to cognitive dysfunction has the potential to reduce symptom burden and alter the clinical trajectory of PD. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACHEIs) improve cognition by increasing cholinergic activity, and include the most widely used dementia drug in the world, donepezil,6 as well as rivastigmine7,8 and galantamine.9,10 Drugs which block cholinergic transmission/ have anticholinergic (ACH) activity, are prescribed by all clinical specialties, and include some of the most commonly used drugs in the United States such as oxybutynin, paroxetine, and diphenhydramine. In the general adult population, ACH medication use is associated with worse performance on cognitive testing,11,12 increased risk of dementia,13–16 falls,17 worsened health related quality of life,18 and increased health service utilization.19 PD patients may be even more vulnerable to the adverse effects of ACH drugs due to disease-related disruption of central cholinergic pathways.20

Co-administration of a drug with high ACH activity and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor represents a frank prescribing error, because these drugs have opposing pharmacological effects. In PD patients, who bear additional risks of cognitive impairment and vulnerability to ACH effects, co-prescribing of an ACHEI and a high potency ACH can be considered a ‘never event’, as it is a medication error likely to cause or sustain disability. There are no data on the occurrence of this prescribing error in the PD population. To address these gaps in knowledge, our study objectives were 1) to describe dementia treatment patterns and 2) to determine the extent to which simultaneous use of ACHEI and drugs with strong ACH activity occurs among individuals diagnosed with PD in the United States. To provide initial data for community based or local policy initiatives aimed at reducing avoidable outcomes, we also examined the geographic variation in potentially inappropriate prescribing to PD patients.

Methods

This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Human Research Protections Office and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Patient consent was not required.

Dataset.

The Medicare program is the primary insurer for 97% of the U.S. population ages 65 and above, and provides inpatient, outpatient and prescription coverage.21 Research Identifiable Files (RIFs) contain individual level data that can be linked across datasets and over time using a beneficiary identification code. Carrier RIFs contain diagnoses and procedures from physician encounters documented using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology codes. The Beneficiary Summary File contains Medicare enrollment/eligibility information, demographic variables, the beneficiary’s postal code, and indicator variables for 27 common chronic medical conditions derived using validated algorithms.21 Prescription Drug Event RIFs contain outpatient prescription drug claims for beneficiaries receiving prescription benefits through the Medicare program, and include drug name, strength, dose, quantity, dispense date and days’ supply. This study utilized data from the 2014 Carrier, Beneficiary Summary and Prescription Drug files.

Inclusion Criteria.

We included Medicare beneficiaries who had 12 consecutive months of inpatient, outpatient and prescription drug coverage in 2014. We identified individuals diagnosed with PD as those having at least two outpatient encounter diagnoses for PD (ICD-9=“332.0”). We then excluded individuals with diagnostic codes for other parkinsonian syndromes (e.g. 333.0 = other diseases of the basal ganglia).

Prescription Drug Identification.

Prescription claims were queried for all drugs with a Food and Drug Administration indication for dementia. Persons with at least one prescription claim for donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine or memantine were defined as taking a dementia drug, and underwent query of all other medications received in that year. Individuals taking donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine were further categorized as taking an ACHEI.

Anticholinergic Medication Classification.

Several methods exist for ranking relative ACH activity; there is no gold standard. The anticholinergic cognitive burden scale (ACB)11 ranks anticholinergic medications in terms of their effects on cognition. Drugs with possible anticholinergic effects (in vitro assays) were given a score of 1. Drugs with established and clinically relevant cognitive anticholinergic effects were given a score of either 2 or 3, based on the drug’s blood-brain barrier permeability (Supplemental Table 1).22

Individual risk/benefit assessments may justify the use of low or mid potency ACH drugs in persons with PD or with PD and dementia, particularly in the absence of evidence that use of such agents impacts the clinical trajectory of PD. It is more difficult to defend concurrent use of a high potency ACH drug simultaneously with an ACHEI, considering that all high potency ACH drugs have low- ACH potency, non-anticholinergic and non-drug alternatives.23 Thus, our primary analyses focused on high-potency ACH drugs..

Study Outcomes.

The primary study outcomes were dementia drug use (yes/no), dementia drug (specific medication), and simultaneous exposure to a high potency ACH drug and ACHEI, hereafter referred to as an ACHhigh-ACHEI event. Drug claims were queried to identify the drugs of interest, and the fill date and days’ supply variables were used to calculate the potential boundaries of exposure for each drug.

Covariables.

We extracted demographic, clinical, and geographical data to use as covariables. Demographic variables were race/ethnicity, age and sex. The presence of atrial fibrillation, dementia, depression, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, COPD, CHF, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease and stroke/transient ischemic attack was determined for each subject, using annual chronic disease indicators. The residential postal code was used to assign each beneficiary to a Hospital Referral Region (HRR), a geographical unit which denotes local health care markets utilized by Medicare beneficiaries for tertiary medical care. 24

Statistical Analysis.

We calculated the prevalence of dementia drug use in our PD sample and described dementia drug use according to demographic and comorbid disease variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were built to determine which demographic and comorbid variables were associated with dementia drug use or with an ACHhigh-ACHEI event. We produced choropleth maps of the prevalence of ACHhigh-ACHEI events in the United States across HRRs, using STATA™ v.15. Finally, SpaceStat™ (Biomedware, Michigan, USA) was used to test for non-random spatial variation in HRR-level rates of ACHhigh-ACHEI events.

Results

Baseline Characteristics.

As displayed in Table 1, 268 407 persons met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of individuals in our sample were identified as White (n=232 831, 86.7%), followed distantly by Black (n=14 629, 5.5%), Asian (n= 7115, 2.7%), Hispanic (n=7176, 2.7%) and Native American (n=874, 0.3%). Women comprised close to half of the PD cases in our sample, an observation which deserves further discussion. Table 1 reports the proportion of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD that is female, not the prevalence of PD among female Medicare beneficiaries. We have previously demonstrated that PD is more prevalent among men compared to women in the Medicare population, 25 consistent with other studies which have demonstrated a sex difference in PD risk. 26 Older women outnumber older men in the United States (60% of persons ages 65+ and 67% of persons ages 85+ are female); this status quo impacts the absolute number of female PD cases. Thus, our finding of somewhat similar numbers of male and female PD cases is wholly consistent with a disease affecting a population (older adults) in which the higher risk group (males) has lower absolute numbers and/or a lower relative survival. The proportion of PD cases in our sample increased with age.

Dementia Drug Use in PD.

As displayed in Table 2, 73 093 (27.2%) of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD in our study sample filled at least one prescription for dementia medication in 2014. Among those taking a dementia medication, the most commonly prescribed medication was donepezil (n=46 027; 63.0% of users) followed by memantine (n=30 578, 41.8%), rivastigmine (n=19 278, 26.4% of users). Galantamine use was uncommon (&lt;3%). Having at least one prescription fill was the basis for our study exposure, but multiple prescription fills may suggest a committed management practice. Excluding individuals who had their first ACHEI fill in December (as refills in 2015 could not be detected), 90.2%, 87.5%, and 88.9% of donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine prescriptions, respectively, were refilled at least once.

Dementia medication use was positively associated with Black (AOR, 95%CI: 1.33, 1.28–1.38) and Hispanic (AOR, 95%CI:1.28, 1.22–1.35) race/ethnicity, and was negatively associated with Native American (AOR, 95%CI: 0.62, 0.51–0.74) and other/unknown (AOR, 95%CI: 0.84, 0.78–0.90) race/ethnicity, as compared to whites. Female sex was associated with lower odds of dementia medication use (AOR, 95%CI: 0.85, 0.84–0.87). Dementia drug use positively associated with age. Medical diagnoses associated with dementia drug prescriptions included dementia (AOR 7.33, 95%CI: 7.18–7.48), depression (AOR 1.80, 95%CI: 1.77–1.83), Hip/Pelvic fracture (AOR 1.26, 95%CI: 1.20–1.33), and stroke/TIA (AOR 1.29, 95%CI: 1.26–1.33). COPD, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension were weakly associated with dementia drug use (Table 3).

Advanced Therapy.

Memantine is FDA indicated for treatment of moderate and advanced dementia. Memantine use increased with age, which is not surprising, but also varied by race and sex. Sixty-one percent of Hispanic PD patients being treated for dementia were prescribed memantine, more than White (47.1%) Black (48.5%), Asian (49.4%) and Native American (43.1%) PD patients receiving dementia drugs. Compared to whites, Hispanic ethnicity was associated with greater adjusted odds of receiving memantine (AOR, 95%CI: 1.42, 1.31–1.53). Female sex was associated with slightly greater odds of memantine use (AOR, 95%CI: 1.08, 1.05–1.11).

Dual Therapy.

Almost two-thirds (66.4%, n=48 527) of study subjects were prescribed only one dementia drug over the 12-month observation period, most frequently donepezil (n = 28 815, 39.4%) followed by rivastigmine (n= 10 636, 14.6%). Dual dementia drug therapy, indicated by concurrent prescription fills for memantine and an ACHEI, was prescribed to 26.7% of the study sample, most often donepezil + memantine (n = 13 987) followed by rivastigmine + memantine (n=5 549). Compared to whites, Black (AOR 1.22, 1.13–1.31) PD patients had greater adjusted odds of receiving combination therapy with donepezil and memantine. Hispanics had greater odds of both donepezil + memantine (AOR 1.14, 1.03–1.26) and rivastigmine + memantine (AOR 1.38, 1.22–1.57). Galantamine + memantine use was too infrequent to generate valid statistical models. The odds of dual therapy increased with age. Sex differences in dual therapy were minimal (Supplemental Table 2).

Concurrent Anticholinergic- ACHEI Use.

Over eighty percent (n=52 069) of the 64 017 PD patients being treated for dementia with an ACHEI had at least one ACH-ACHEI co-prescribing event; 68.0%, (n=43554) had a concurrent prescription fill with a low potency anticholinergic, 7.6% (n=4892) had a concurrent fill with a mid- potency anticholinergic, and 44.5% (n=28495) had at least one concurrent prescription fill with a high potency anticholinergic (Table 2). Considering the possibility that there was intention to stop the ACH drug (such as verbal or written communication to the patient) that was not reflected in claims data, we determined how frequently sequential ACH-ACHEI events occurred. A sequential ACH-ACHEI event was defined as a second concurrent filling of a high potency ACH and ACHEI (donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine), occurring immediately after the first. We allowed for switching between one high potency ACH drug to another, as our exposure of interest was concurrent exposure to an ACHEI and high potency ACH drug over multiple fill cycles. We found sequential ACH-ACHEI fills were common- 84.9% of persons who filled a prescription for donepezil + a high ACH drug had at least one successive ACHhigh-donepezil event, 84.1% of ACHhigh-rivastigmine events occurred more than once as well.

As shown in Table 4, regression models that adjusted for demographic characteristics and comorbid diseases found that Blacks were less likely to be co-prescribed ACHEIs and high-potency anticholinergics (AOR 0.83, 95%CI 0.77–0.89) relative to Whites. Conversely, Hispanics (AOR 1.11, 95%CI 1.00–1.23) and women (AOR 1.30, 95%CI 1.25–1.35) had greater odds of this ‘never event’. Concurrent high-potency ACH-ACHEI prescribing negatively associated with age. Concurrent high-potency ACH-ACHEI prescribing was associated with comorbid depression (AOR 1.62, 95%CI 1.57–1.68), COPD (AOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.03–1.17), hypertension (AOR 1.13, 95%CI 1.09–1.19), chronic kidney disease (AOR 1.08, 95%CI, 1.03–1.12), diabetes (AOR 1.07, 95%CI 1.03–1.11), and heart failure (AOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02–1.11). Concomitant high potency ACH and ACHEI use was not associated with comorbid cerebrovascular events, ischemic heart disease, or hyperlipidemia.

Geographical Variation in PD ‘never events’.

There was wide geographic variation in concurrent ACHhigh-ACHEI prescribing among Medicare beneficiaries with PD across HRRs, from as low as 17.4% to as high as 72.4%. As shown in Figure 1, the prevalence of this ‘never event’ demonstrated significant spatial clustering (Moran’s I = 0.24; P &lt; 0.001). Clusters of high inappropriate prescribing were found in the Southern and Midwestern United States, and clusters of low inappropriate prescribing were present in the Northwest and Northeast United States.

Discussion

An understudied threat to our ability to identify comprehensive and consistent drivers of cognitive decline and dementia in PD is bias from non-PD cognitive impairment, that is, disturbance or decline in cognition or performance on cognitive testing due to factors other than PD progression. If random, such factors may mask the benefit of a neuroprotective medication, if systematic, spurious associations may be found, invalid risk factors for dementia or biomarkers associated with dementia may be identified. Of great concern are preventable or reversible contributors to cognitive dysfunction, such as medication side effects.

In this study, we examined prescribing patterns related to cognitive impairment in PD from a public health perspective. Our primary findings are (1) there are demographic differences in dementia drug choice and (2) inappropriate cholinergic drug combinations, which can potentially impact patient and research outcomes, are frequently prescribed to Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with PD. These data call into question whether there are unique PD trajectories across demographic groups, and suggests there may be contributors to cognitive impairment in PD that can be addressed at the population level.

We found that dementia treatment among PD patients is prevalent, consistent with the rising tide of dementia in the United States27 and previous studies of dementia in PD.5,28 We also found racial differences in the likelihood of receiving dementia drugs. Black and Hispanic persons with PD were more often prescribed dementia drugs compared to Whites. Hispanics were prescribed memantine, a drug primarily indicated for severe disease (alone or in conjunction with an ACHEI), more frequently than individuals of other races. There are many possible explanations for these observations. Black Medicare beneficiaries with PD are at greater risk of both vascular dementia29 and AD30 than Whites. Thus, the observed increased odds of dementia medication use among blacks may be due to coexisting vascular dementia, PD+D, or a mixed neurocognitive profile (e.g. PD+AD). The preferential use of memantine among individuals with Hispanic ethnicity may suggest that Hispanics have a more severe form of dementia, present later in the disease course, or have greater intolerance of ACHEIs. Alternatively, lower cross-cultural validity of cognitive testing may result in over-estimations of dementia severity in some Hispanics,31 particularly in individuals for whom English is a second language. Implicit provider bias may drive differences in prescribing, or magnify health disparities.32 Longitudinal studies of cognitive profiles among racial and ethnic groups with PD are needed to better understand the contributions of multiple potential factors on dementia treatment in PD.

Women with PD were less likely than men to be treated for dementia, even though women have a higher risk of clinical dementia, due to the unrelated increased risk of AD in females.33 Dementia in women may be more sensitive to effect modification by comorbid disease treatment.34 Cognitive impairment may be under-recognized or under-treated in women, who are more likely to develop visuoconstructional deficits rather than impairments in activities of daily living, and are less likely to receive specialist care.35,36 As with ethnic minorities, sex-specific studies in PD are needed.

ACHEI-ACH use

Concurrent prescribing of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and a high potency anticholinergic medication, which should be a “never event,” was disturbingly common. Up to 45% of PD patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia filled a prescription for a medication that could further worsen their cognitive impairment in the course of a single year, assuming that the high potency anticholinergic did not produce the cognitive impairment. We also identified several high-risk groups, which represent targets for immediate focus. Women and Hispanics, who often receive lower quality care and decreased access to care,37–39 are more subject to this prescribing error. Our findings are disturbing, but not unique to the PD population, as suggested by studies of prescribing error in antiretroviral therapy40 and antipsychotic therapy.41 Research designed to understand the drivers of potentially unsafe concurrent use and define group-specific effects of drug-drug interactions may be needed to improve cognitive outcomes for all PD patients.

Comorbid diseases were associated with potentially inappropriate prescribing. In particular, depression was associated with 62% higher odds of potentially inappropriate drug combinations. Several antidepressant medications, including tricyclic antidepressants and paroxetine, are classified as high potency anticholinergic drugs. Alternatively, depressed mood and apathy are symptoms associated with cognitive decline, particularly in PD,42 and are important to treat appropriately. Older adults frequently have multiple treatable medical diagnoses for which clinical guidelines recommend intermittent or chronic drug therapy. Thus, comorbid condition guidelines may provide initial intervention targets for reducing inappropriate prescribing in PD. Future studies will include conditions not included in the CMS chronic conditions dataset that are particularly relevant to PD patients, such as urinary dysfunction.

We found wide geographical variation in potentially inappropriate prescribing for PD in the U.S., ranging from 17.4% along the coasts to as high as 72.4% in the rural South. These geographical variances may by influenced by local prescribing habits, or reflect differential access to neurologic care.36, 43 Future studies will examine provider and practice factors impacting prescribing habits such as specialty, gender, PD patient volume, and care fragmentation. Regardless, our identification of geographic disparities in prescribing safety calls into question whether geography-based multidisciplinary interventions designed to improve provider education and patient outcomes, similar to the Parkinson-NET approach used in the Netherlands,44 would be effective in the United States.

Limitations

Our dataset represents a national sample of US adults over 65 years of age with a diagnosis of Parkinson disease and provides previously unreported data on inappropriate prescribing in this vulnerable patient population. However, some important limitations should be noted. We obtained claims data from a single year, which may not reflect current practice. Our current data do not allow us to deeply examine the potential influences of prescriber specialty and practice characteristics on the odds of dementia drug use and ACHEI-ACH events, nor could we examine additional factors which may impact prescription filling such as patient out-of-pocket costs. These types of data are important for designing scalable interventions to reduce ineffective prescribing events.

Dementia drug use can be considered an indicator of cognitive impairment, but is not an inclusive indicator of a dementia diagnosis. Thus, our drug use estimates do not reflect the prevalence of dementia among persons with PD. Non-drug options may be pursued at any stage of dementia, for various reasons, including intolerance or response to non-medical therapy. Additionally, our study design could not examine patient groups for which dementia drug use would be perceived as futile. Nursing home residents, and individuals with proximately terminal conditions (e.g. end stage heart failure, metastatic cancer) may have appropriate simplification of their medication regimens, which would prioritize weaning medications with modest benefit observed over a long time period (like dementia medications). Off-label use of rivastigmine for freezing of gait 45 or REM behavior disorder 46 has limited evidence support, but may have occurred nonetheless. Drug prescribing errors are possible, and cannot be traced in these data. All of these factors could influence our overall and demographic subgroup estimates of dementia drug use.

Some medications on the anticholinergic cognitive burden scale list are available without a prescription. We were unable to examine these medications in our prescription claim based study, thus our anticholinergic drug data may underestimate actual use. Future studies which include over the counter drug use (among other potential effect modifiers) will examine the relationships between total anticholinergic burden or chronic anticholinergic exposure and clinical and research outcomes in PD patients.

Conclusion

In this study, we identified unique patterns of dementia drug use among individuals with PD, along with racial, sex, and geographic disparities in potentially inappropriate prescribing habits. This nationwide assessment of dementia treatment in PD in the United States identifies areas of particular concern for targeted study and intervention. To evaluate whether anticholinergic drug exposure has a causal role in clinical dementia in PD, it may be best to take a clinical trial approach in future studies, in which high potency anticholinergic medications are replaced with lower potency alternatives, and the change in cognitive testing and cognitive trajectory are measured. Such an approach will allow us to calculate ACH drug safety in terms that are easily understood, such as number needed to harm. Additionally, pragmatic approaches to provider education may lessen negative patient outcomes in future.
