Background.

Epidemiological studies have shown that Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are seen more frequently with asthma, especially with greater asthma severity or exacerbation frequency.

Objective.

To examine the changes in brain structure that may underlie this phenomenon, we examined diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and blood-based biomarkers of AD (p-Tau181), neurodegeneration (NfL) and glial activation (GFAP).

Methods.

dMRI data were obtained in 111 individuals with asthma, ranging in disease severity from mild to severe, and 135 healthy controls. Regression analyses were used to test the relationships between asthma severity and neuroimaging measures, as well as AD pathology, neurodegeneration and glial activation, indexed by plasma p-Tau181, NfL and GFAP respectively. Additional relationships were tested with cognitive function.

Results.

Asthma participants had widespread and large magnitude differences in several dMRI metrics, which were indicative of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and robustly associated with GFAP and to a lesser extent, with NfL. The AD biomarker p-Tau181 was only minimally associated with neuroimaging outcomes. Further, asthma severity was associated with deleterious changes in neuroimaging outcomes, which in turn, were associated with slower processing speed, a test of cognitive performance.

Conclusion.

These data suggest that asthma, particularly when severe, is associated with characteristics of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and may be a potential risk factor for neural injury and cognitive dysfunction. The results suggest a need to determine how asthma may affect brain health and whether treatment directed toward characteristics of asthma associated with these risks can mitigate these effects.

Capsule Summary:

Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration contribute to impaired brain health and cognitive decline. Here, we present evidence that these processes are observed in asthma, which may represent a modifiable risk factor.

pmcIntroduction

Airway inflammation is a pathogenic characteristic of asthma and contributes to its symptoms, susceptibility to exacerbations, airway remodeling, and serves as a primary target for effective therapy. Moreover, the effects of airway inflammation may not be restricted to the airways and systemic manifestations can occur. Peters et al. found metabolic dysfunction and increased serum concentrations of IL-6, primarily in a subgroup with severe asthma(1). Our understanding of the systemic effects of asthma are currently limited and their scope is likely under-appreciated; for example, the possibility that airway inflammation may contribute to impaired brain health, beyond the widely recognized and clinically important associations with depression, has generated interest but limited study. However, the potential importance and impact of asthma on brain health is emphasized by population-based studies which, though limited, found an increased risk for dementia in asthma(2–4) that was amplified in patients with frequent or severe exacerbations(5). These associations are further supported by animal studies showing that neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes result from airway inflammation(6,7).

Although systemic effects associated with asthma suggest inflammatory injury to peripheral tissue, evidence of inflammatory injury in non-pulmonary target organs, such as the brain, is currently lacking. We previously demonstrated that an allergen-provoked eosinophilic airway inflammatory response was associated with changes in brain function(8,9). However, studies to assess whether asthma may also be associated with more fundamental changes in brain health have not been reported. To explore relationships between asthma and brain health, new developments in both neuroimaging and blood-based biomarker measurements make it feasible to identify neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes with high degrees of sensitivity. Using these neuroimaging and biofluid analytic approaches, we conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, case-control analysis, to determine whether brain white matter microstructural changes exist in asthma and are associated with serological determinants of altered brain health. Our exploratory analyses represent an initial effort to evaluate the novel hypothesis that asthma is a risk factor for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, which may exist despite an absence of concurrent cognitive deficits. Longitudinal studies will be essential in establishing whether asthma confers an increase in risk for progression to clinically important manifestations of white matter deterioration and result in functional impairment. Nevertheless, our initial findings are a necessary first step in demonstrating that altered brain microstructure is found in asthma. Further, these data will be directive in clarifying phenotype(s) of disease that may confer the greatest risk, and in identifying potential therapeutic targets to prevent deleterious impacts of asthma on brain health.

Methods

Participants.

Our analyses included 111 (57% female) participants with asthma and 135 (59% female) non-asthmatic healthy controls, ranging in age from 18–73 years. All asthma patients had a physician’s diagnosis of asthma and stable disease control for at least 4 weeks prior to study in order to ensure safety in the conduct of the enrolled protocols (see below) and to avoid recent use of interventions which may affect baseline airway inflammation and concurrent neuroimaging measures. Neuroimaging data were analyzed retrospectively from participants who took part in previous University of Wisconsin Asthma Research studies, for which MRI scans had been acquired. At enrollment measurements of lung function, peripheral blood eosinophils (EOS), and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were made, along with a review of current medications and an assessment of disease control.

The asthma population evaluated represents a diverse group of participants with disease severity ranging from mild to severe. Twenty-five participants were recruited based on their participation in the University of Wisconsin Severe Asthma Research Project and met European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society (ATS) Workshop(10) criteria for severe asthma at the time of enrollment. Sixty-seven participants were recruited for a behavioral intervention study (reported elsewhere) and had evidence of persistent airway inflammation, as defined by FeNO ≥ 30 ppb, blood eosinophil count ≥ 150, or sputum eosinophils ≥ 2%, and had a minimum pre-albuterol baseline FEV1 of 60% at enrollment. Finally, nineteen participants were recruited for a protocol to investigate neuroimmune interactions in asthma (reported elsewhere); these participants had a baseline FEV1 of 70% or greater, with a 12% reversibility or PC20 response to methacholine &lt; 16.0 mg/ml and were not using inhaled corticosteroid medications.

Non-asthma healthy controls were recruited from the Madison, WI area as part of the behavioral intervention study (mentioned above) and were required to be free of an asthma diagnosis, symptoms compatible with asthma, and medications used to treat asthma. While none had assessment of pulmonary function or bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine, all control participants were in good health and had no history of lung disease.

Across groups, participants were excluded for incompatibility with the MRI environment, current smoking, pregnancy, history of neurological disorder, traumatic brain injury, psychotic disorders, and all were cognitively normal. Recruitment information and complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in supplementary materials. Though the data reported here were acquired in the context of 3 separate studies, all data were collected contemporaneously, using the same equipment, scan protocols, processing pipelines, and personnel.

Lung function assessment and measures of inflammation

Lung function was measured according to ATS standards(11). As biomarkers for airway inflammation(12), FeNO was measured following ATS guidelines(13) (NIOX System; Aerocrine, Solna, Sweden) and a peripheral blood eosinophil (EOS) count (cells/uL) was obtained. In addition, participants completed the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) at enrollment(14).

Principal components analysis was used to create a composite score of asthma burden from five separate measures: FEV1 percent predicted, ACQ-6 (ACQ score excluding FEV1), FeNO, EOS, and a medication score (see supplemental information). This resulted in two orthogonal components: an asthma severity score comprised of ACQ-6, FEV1, and medication score, and a Type (T)2 inflammation score comprised of FeNO and EOS. Details of this analysis and the relationships among the five measures and two derived scores are described in supplementary material.

Brain imaging

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data, a validated, non-invasive tool to examine regional microstructural alterations in the brain(15), were acquired on a 3 Tesla General Electric MR750 Discovery scanner. Acquisition parameters are detailed in supplementary material. Each scan was reviewed by a neuroradiologist and participants with anatomical abnormalities were excluded (5 asthma, 5 control). Images underwent standard pre-processing procedures. Motion artifacts were visually assessed using in-house processing pipelines. Diffusion tensors (DTI) were estimated at each voxel and quantitative maps of fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, radial and axial diffusivity were derived(16). DMRI data were also fit to the three-compartment neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) tissue model(17), using the AMICO-NODDI algorithm(18), to provide estimates of neurite density index, orientation dispersion index, and free water volume fractions. In white matter, these DTI and NODDI metrics inform the density, organization, and integrity of myelinated axons, which are critical for efficient brain network connectivity and when sufficiently compromised, gives rise to a wide variety of neurological disorders. DTI and NODDI parameter maps were aligned with a population-specific template and smoothed using a 4mm full-width-at-half-max Gaussian filter. See supplementary material for full processing methods.

Glial activation, Neurodegeneration, and AD Biomarker Measures

Blood samples for measurement of plasma biomarkers were acquired from asthma patients only, under baseline conditions, and stored at −80°C until analysis. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was measured to assess neuroinflammation, neurofilament light chain (NfL) was measured to assess neurodegeneration, and p-Tau181 was measured to assess AD-specific pathology. Biomarker concentrations were measured using ultra-sensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) technology on an HD-X instrument (Quanterix, Billerica, MA). Plasma GFAP concentration was measured using the GFAP Discovery Kit, plasma NfL concentration was measured using the NF-light Advantage Kit, and p-Tau181 concentration was measured using the pTau-181 Advantage Kit, according to manufacturer instructions (Quanterix, Billerica, MA). All measurements were performed in one round of experiments, using one batch of reagents by laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical data. Mean intra-assay coefficients of variation (SD) were 6.63% (5.57%) for GFAP, 4.72% (3.45%) for NfL, and 5.13% (4.70%) for p-Tau181.

Processing speed as an index of cognitive function

Reaction time (RT) in an asthma variant of the Stroop Task(19) was used to assess processing speed. Processing speed, as indexed by mean RT, is a widely accepted indicator of global cognitive function and has been previously applied in dementia and AD research(20,21), but is not an indicator of dementia per se. Here, processing speed was used to assess the functional consequences associated with dMRI alterations. Briefly, participants were asked to identify the color of letters spelling asthma-specific, negative, and neutral words with a button press during the collection of neuroimaging data (for details see (9)). RT was averaged for trials with correct responses only, within-subject, across valence conditions.

Data analysis

Whole-brain voxel-wise group differences (Asthma vs. Control) in the neuroimaging metrics were tested with Permutation Analysis of Linear Models(22,23) (PALM) using tail acceleration and 500 permutations(24). PALM enables joint inference over multiple dMRI metrics, known as Non-Parametric Combination (NPC), while also providing inference on the separate contribution of each metric(22). Joint inference of group differences was assessed with NPC and Fisher’s combining function across seven dMRI metrics: FA, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity, neurite density index, orientation dispersion index, and free water volume fractions, while differences in individual metrics were also evaluated. Within the asthma group only, a similar whole-brain approach was used to investigate the association between dMRI metrics and asthma severity, T2 inflammation, and plasma biomarkers. The relationships among asthma severity, T2 inflammation, and plasma biomarkers were assessed using linear regression, with age as a covariate. Group differences in processing speed were tested using linear regression with group and age regressed on mean RT. Group differences in the relationship between processing speed and dMRI were examined using a voxel-wise approach in PALM, as described above.

Voxel-wise analyses were restricted to white matter using a tissue-specific mask, and age, sex, and total head motion were included as nuisance covariates. Voxels showing significant group differences in dMRI metrics, or significant associations with regressors of interest were identified in the omnibus test, using threshold-free cluster enhancement and family-wise error correction to control inflation of type I error. Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.

Results

Participants

Asthma and control groups did not differ in their distribution of sex, but the control group was significantly older (M = 43.9 [25–66] years) than the asthma group (M = 39.8 [18–73] years; t = 2.2, p = .03).

Neuroimaging results

Widespread and large magnitude differences in white matter microstructure were present between asthma and controls (corrected p &lt; .05; Fig 1). After controlling for age, sex, and motion during collection of neuroimaging data, significant differences were observed in nearly every individual dMRI metric. When dMRI metrics were evaluated in relationship to asthma severity, deterioration in myelinated axons (mean and radial diffusivity) was more profound in the presence of severe disease (corrected p &lt; .05; Fig 2). This deterioration was observed in multiple brain regions that include fiber bundles of the corticospinal tract, external capsule, inferior longitudinal fasciculi, superior longitudinal fasciculi, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi — tracts previously implicated in cognitive decline(25,26). In contrast, markers for T2 inflammation (FeNO and EOS) showed no significant associations with any of the dMRI metrics.

Relationship of dMRI metrics to plasma biomarkers

The association between deterioration in myelinated axons and GFAP was widespread and observed across dMRI metrics (Fig 3A). In comparison, the association between NfL and white matter microstructure (Fig 3B) was relatively circumscribed, localized primarily in the corona radiata and internal capsule, a fiber bundle that connects the cerebral cortex to mid-brain and brainstem. The relationship between white matter microstructure and p-Tau181 was limited to a very small region of cerebellar white matter, where a higher p-Tau181 concentration was associated with lower mean diffusivity. There were no regions in the cerebral cortex where p-Tau181 was associated with dMRI.

Relationships of plasma biomarkers to phenotypic aspects of asthma

Plasma GFAP concentration was positively associated with asthma severity (t = 2.7, p = .008; Fig 4), controlling for age, such that a one unit increase in asthma severity is associated with a 7.9 unit increase in GFAP. GFAP was not associated with T2 inflammation (t = −.33, p = .74). Plasma NfL concentration was not associated with asthma severity or T2 inflammation (ps &gt; .05). Similarly, plasma p-tau181 concentration was unrelated to asthma severity and T2 score (ps &gt; .1), respectively).

Relationship of dMRI metrics to processing speed

While a robust group difference in processing speed was not found (t = 1.8, p = .07) a marginal difference was present. In addition, significant group differences were observed in the slope of the relationship between processing speed and white matter microstructure, in tracts that mirrored those showing an association with asthma severity. This group difference in slopes was such that the deleterious effect of white matter microstructural change on processing speed was greater for participants with asthma (Fig. 5) and was present in multiple dMRI metrics.

Discussion

Using newly developed blood-based biomarkers of glial activation and neurodegeneration, in addition to sensitive neuroimaging measures, we found that asthma was associated with significant deleterious alterations in white matter, resembling in extent and magnitude, those observed in neurodegenerative diseases. The striking differences in dMRI metrics were greater among participants with more severe asthma. Moreover, the deleterious nature of the white matter alterations was corroborated by their association with plasma concentrations of GFAP and to a lesser degree, NfL, suggesting that asthma is associated with glial activation and neurodegenerative processes, independent of normal aging, with potentially important, but subtle, consequences for cognitive function.

Asthma severity was also an important factor in relationship to brain imaging findings. A relationship between asthma severity and altered brain microstructure was present in the same white matter regions that differed between asthma and controls. Given that these regions appear to be vulnerable to glial activation, we speculate that asthma-associated inflammation provokes central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, contributing to the vulnerability of these brain regions and eventual cognitive impairment. Prior work has shown that AD-associated glial activation influences large-scale brain network connectivity, which in turn is associated with cognitive deficits(27). The superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, in particular, connect cortical brain regions that are adversely affected by AD and subserve memory netoworks(28–30). Alterations in these pathways have also been shown to precede the development of dementia symptoms and to correlate with cerebrospinal fluid markers of microglia activation and AD pathology(31).

Increased expression of GFAP is a characteristic that defines reactive astrocytes(32). Indeed, together with NfL – a marker of axonal damage, GFAP has been used as an indicator of disease severity and progression in several neurodegenerative diseases(33–37). The presence of reactive astrocytes is an important indicator of neuroinflammation. Though astrocytes are essential in supporting brain health, they can lose their supportive functions, as well as cause the degeneration of neurons, an increase in microvascular permeability, and an amplification of the inflammatory state directly, and via their interactions with microglia when they become reactive during CNS injury(38–40). Though neuroinflammation and neural injury have been identified in animal models of asthma(7,41), we report for the first time that these processes are also observed with asthma.

While the relationship between brain microstructure and GFAP was evident throughout the brain, the relationship with NfL was largely confined to the internal capsule. The internal capsule has been shown to be vulnerable to microvascular injury and increased arterial stiffness(42), which are apparent in asthma, even in children(43–45). Alterations in internal capsule integrity are found across numerous disorders of cognition and emotion, including depression(46,47) and ADRD(48,49), and correlate with symptom expression and degree of functional impairment. While cerebrovascular measures were not considered in our study, they deserve further research in the context of asthma, particularly given prior findings that altered subcortical white matter tracts contribute to cognitive impairment in vascular dementia(50).

To assess, in part, whether airway inflammation may instigate or exacerbate neural injury, we examined FeNO and EOS as surrogate markers of T2 inflammation in asthma. We did not observe a significant association between these proxies for T2 inflammation and white matter microstructure or plasma biomarkers of neural injury. However, determinations of T2 inflammation were obtained with 44% of participants on medications to reduce airway inflammation, which could obscure fluctuations in airway inflammation that might have cumulatively impacted the brain over time. Futhermore, in an exploratory analysis, we assessed the relationship between markers of T2 inflammation and dMRI in participants using only rescue medication (N = 62). Though insufficiently powered to reach significance, several regions of the brain showed associations in the expected direction at an uncorrected threshold of p &lt; .01. Nonetheless, our analysis captured a truncated range of airway inflammation. Therefore, a more accurate assessment of the impact of underlying airway inflammation on neural injury will require further study and an expanded assessment of the expression of inflammatory pathways, including Th17 activation and IL-17 generation, particularly among asthma patients with more pronounced and persistent airway inflammation or in proximity to an exacerbation.

The importance of peripheral inflammation to altered brain health is underscored by findings in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), which is also associated with increased prevalence of dementia that has been found to be abrogated by the recent introduction of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment(51), This suggests that chronic systemic inflammation contributes to neuropathology and dementia and can be attenuated by inhibiting the actions of a key inflammatory mediator, TNF-α. TNF-α expression is increased in asthma, and further increased following an experimental allergen challenge(52) and during naturally occurring exacerbations(53). Similarly, the T17 immune response has a synergistic relationship with the T2 response in the pathogenicity of asthma(54,55). Moreover, TH17 cells traffic to the brain(56,57) and have been shown to play a role in neurodegeneration(58,59). Thus, a more expansive examination of inflammatory pathways and their interactions will be necessary to more fully and precisely establish the pathogenic pathways of inflammation associated with altered brain health in asthma.

The diagnosis of dementia is uncommon before 65 years of age, but the pathological processes that underlie its development and clinical expression are set in motion long before cognitive decline occurs – perhaps even early in life(60–64). To put our findings into a clinical perspective, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are commonly observed processes in neurodegenerative diseases, and are closely associated with the clinical phenotype of dementia(65). Further, neuroinflammation likely accelerates the onset of dementia symptoms(66,67). Yet, the contribution of the white matter microstructural changes reported here to the eventual development of dementia remains speculative. In contrast to GFAP and NfL, p-Tau181, which is a specific marker of AD, was not associated with cortical neuroimaging metrics in asthma, suggesting either that asthma may not be associated with AD pathology specifically, or that AD pathology was not measurable in our cohort, which was cognitively unimpaired and relatively young (median age = 37.5 y), compared to typical studies of dementia.

The functional relevance of the brain alterations reported here is supported by an association with processing speed, a widely used index of cognitive function that correlates highly with performance on a broad range of more targeted cognitive tasks(20). Slower processing speed in asthma participants was associated with poorer white matter integrity in the tracts discussed above, in addition to the corticospinal tract, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and forceps major, indicative perhaps, of an accelerated decline in cognitive function in asthma when white matter microstructure is compromised. These observations corroborate prior research that demonstrates the importance of these tracts in processing speed(68–70) and deterioration in processing speed in neurodegenerative diseases(71,72). Nonetheless, processing speed represents only a single functional outcome and limits the conclusions we can draw regarding the implications of the white matter microstructural changes reported here for functional impairment. A more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function and longitudinal evaluation will ultimately be required to determine whether these changes lead to increased risk of dementia.

A number of other factors may contribute to the observed brain changes, including effects of inflammation on the vasculature. Asthma exacerbations increase airway inflammation and airflow obstruction, sometimes resulting in hypoxia. The availability of historical data on the frequency and severity of asthma exacerbations in our participants was too sparse to support meaningful inference of these outcomes as contributors to neurodegeneration. Sleep deficit is also associated with neural injury, and often coexists with asthma(73). We examined group differences in self-reported sleep quality as well as relationships between sleep quality and white matter microstructure in those with sleep quality data available (see ​Fig E2 in the Online Repository available at www.jacionline.org). We found no evidence that sleep disruption accounted for our observed effects.

The influence of treatment must also be considered. The mitigating effects of anti-TNF-α in RA(51) suggest that treatment to suppress underlying peripheral inflammation may be neuroprotective. Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids diminish airway and peripheral markers of T2 inflammation(74). Our observations suggest that, despite ongoing treatment with ICS, brain microstructural changes were present raising the possibility that inflammatory factors not susceptible to corticosteroid regulation contribute to alteration in brain health. Although adverse effects of asthma medications may contribute to changes in brain structure, these associations are variable and infrequent(7,75–79). There is some evidence that Montelukast – a leukotriene receptor antagonist – is neuroprotective(76,80,81) and can slow age-related cognitive decline(80,82). Prolonged oral corticosteroid use, on the other hand, has been associated with reduced grey matter volume of the amygdala and hippocampus, a global reduction in white matter volume, and reduced cognitive performance in cross-sectional studies(83–85). Nonetheless, the only prospective study found equivocal effects on cognitive performance and no change in hippocampal volume(86).

A few limitations of the study deserve mention. First, the analyses were retrospective, though the number of participants studied was large (n=111) and represented a broad spectrum of disease severity. Given the case-controlled nature of our analyses, these results will need to be replicated in an independent sample. Second, the scope of the functional consequences and clinical import of the white matter deterioration that we observed has not yet been established. Plasma p-tau181 concentration was unrelated to cortical white matter microstructure, suggesting that at least at the time of assessment, there was no evidence to indicate pathology specific to AD. Indeed, at recruitment, all participants were cognitively normal. Moreover, plasma for biomarker analysis was only acquired from participants with asthma, limiting the support that these measures can provide in interpreting group differences. Thus, additional research, including longitudinal study, is needed to definitively determine if the brain microstructural changes we observed contribute meaningfully to cognitive deficits and, in the long-term, to the development of dementia. Finally, our findings are descriptive and cannot yet establish the underlying mechanisms or inflammatory profile associated with these white matter structural changes. This need is a critical focus for future research; for therapeutic mitigation to be effective, a more precise understanding of the pathways involved will be required. Nonetheless, we believe our findings are of potential clinical significance and reveal another important consequence of systemic inflammation in asthma.

The potential public health impact of our findings is considerable. More than 5 million people in the U.S currently live with ADRD, a prevalence that nearly doubles every two decades(87). The current lack of effective treatments for neurodegenerative disease makes identification of early risk factors a promising approach for potential interventions to delay onset, slow progression, or prevent these neural injuries and the risk for dementia that they confer, and is a major research priority(88). With increasing incidences of both chronic inflammatory diseases(89,90) and dementia(87), it will be critical to determine if persistent or poorly controlled airway inflammation in asthma is capable of provoking an inflammatory response in the brain, to either initiate or exacerbate neurodegenerative processes and eventually lead to impairment in cognitive function. Consequently, our findings invite the possibility that efforts designed to improve disease control by more effectively controlling airway inflammation will decrease or delay risks for neurodegeneration and dementia. Addressing this possibility is important and highly relevant to the large population of asthma patients who may be at risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment and will be a focus for future research.

Figure 4: Relationship between plasma GFAP and asthma severity

Scatter plot displaying the relationship between plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) concentration and asthma severity, with variance accounted for by age removed from both variables (B = 7.9; t = 2.7, p = .008).

Figure 5: Reduced white matter integrity is associated with a deficit in processing speed in participants with asthma, but not in non-asthma healthy controls.

(A) Representative sagittal slice of a standard white matter template displaying voxels where the relationship between reaction time (RT) in the Stroop task and neurite density is significantly more negative for the asthma group compared to the control group. Image thresholded at a corrected p &lt; .05 (B) Scatter plot displaying the relationship between individual neurite density, averaged over the whole-brain analysis cluster shown in (A) and individual mean RT for each group, with variance accounted for by age and sex removed from both variables. Participants with asthma are shown in blue; non-asthma participants are shown in violet. Neurite density showed the strongest interaction between group and RT and was thus chosen as a representative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) metric for plotting purposes, but this effect was observed across multiple DWI metrics.

Key Messages

Brain white matter showed evidence of structural deterioration in individuals with asthma, relative to an age and sex-matched group of healthy controls, which was more pronounced with more severe disease.

Relationships with blood-based biomarkers suggest that brain white matter changes observed in participants with asthma are neuroinflammatory and/or neurodegenerative in nature.

While this sample was cognitively normal, a relationship with cognitive processing speed suggests that changes to brain white matter may confer greater functional consequences for individuals with asthma.
