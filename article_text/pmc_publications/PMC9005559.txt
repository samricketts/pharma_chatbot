African Americans experience a significantly greater burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to non-Hispanic White Americans. Raising awareness and increasing knowledge of AD within African American communities is an important step towards addressing these disparities. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two approaches to sharing AD knowledge with community residents. Using a quasi-experimental design, African American participants were recruited through community partners and local resources in two comparable neighborhoods in Duval County, Florida, which formed the intervention and the comparison groups for this study. The identical 40-minute educational lecture was provided to both groups. In the intervention community, the lecture was followed by focus group sessions modeled after the Dementia Friendly America toolkit. In the comparison community, the lecture was followed by a social event where participants could interact informally with the speaker and dementia outreach staff. A brief quantitative survey assessing AD knowledge was administered to participants in both groups before the education session, immediately after the lecture, and two months later. Results indicate that both groups improved their knowledge scores at immediate post-test. Scores for both groups declined at two-month follow-up, but the comparison group’s scores declined more precipitously than the intervention group’s scores (p=0.0.21). These results suggest that conducting focus groups and interviews following a lecture on AD may help better retain AD knowledge over time.

pmcIntroduction

Dementia is a general term attributed to a decline in memory or other thinking abilities severe enough to interfere with an individual’s personal, interpersonal, professional, or social life [1]. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among older adults and disproportionately burdens African Americans compared to all other major ethnic/racial groups in the US [1–3]. Studies report that African Americans are at twice the risk of incident AD or AD-related disorders as compared to non-Hispanic Whites [1,3] but are significantly underrepresented in AD clinical trials [4,5], raising concern regarding whether new therapies will be equally effective for all individuals.

An important step to address AD disparities among African Americans is to raise awareness and knowledge of dementia within predominantly African American communities. Several organizations provide AD outreach and education specific to African American communities, including African Americans Against Alzheimer’s and the Alzheimer’s Association. These organizations utilize a variety of methods, including educational lectures, support groups, performing arts, and resource fairs [6,7]. Private groups and programs across the United States also help educate African Americans about AD. In Los Angeles, California, BrainWorks helps to improve AD literacy among African American community-dwelling adults [8]. In Newark, New Jersey, the Rutgers University-Newark African-American Brain Health Initiative holds several annual health educational events including “lunch ‘n’ learns” to educate the African American community on brain health [9]. Moreover, several large programs across the US designated by the National Institute on Aging as Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers provide dementia outreach specific to African Americans, but also Hispanics, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, and Asians [10].

Traditionally, dementia outreach has involved medical experts and scientists presenting dementia-related topics to community audiences; however, the impact of such models on acquisition and maintenance of new knowledge of AD at the community level is not well understood [5]. The objective of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of two approaches following the delivery of AD information to community-dwelling African Americans.

Dementia Friendly Outreach Model

The Dementia Friendly America program, based on the global dementia friendly communities movement, represents a community-level outreach model where individuals from all sectors of society – including people with AD, formal and informal care partners, residents, health professionals, businesses, government, faith-based organizations, and community groups – come together to support people living with dementia and their caregivers [11]. It is a place in which people with dementia and their care partners “are empowered, supported, and included in society, understand their rights, and recognize their full potential” [12, p.10]. Its main objectives are to have an impact on the lived experiences of people with AD through awareness raising (to consequentially reduce associated stigma), participation and support [13].

In the United States (US), Minnesota has been leading the dementia friendly efforts since 2011 through its statewide collaboration, ACT on Alzheimer’s [14]. The collaboration developed the Dementia Friendly Communities Toolkit [15] to help communities across the US to adopt dementia friendly initiatives through a rigorous and structured community-based participatory research approach [16]. In Florida, the Department of Elder Affairs adopted the Dementia Care and Cure Initiative in 2015 to encourage cities across the state to adopt dementia friendly efforts [17]. Currently, 16 communities in Florida are working toward this goal [17].

The first phase of the dementia friendly model is to conduct a needs assessment through quantitative (surveys) and qualitative research methods (focus groups and interviews) to better understand the needs of the community. There have been few applications of this model specifically with and for African American populations in the US. Studies that have conducted this first step of the process have focused on developing dementia friendly churches [18–20]. Considering that people with AD also have the right to feel respected, included and supported in the environments where they live [12], we were interested in broader environments, such as neighborhoods.

The literature suggests that receptivity and ownership of new information within African American communities is facilitated when community members work in partnership with the individuals or organizations providing the message [21]. The dementia friendly model embodies this concept of partnership by engaging community members to understand, review, and prioritize goals in achieving a more “dementia friendly” community. This partnership continues through the development, implementation, and evaluation of the community chosen goals, and offers opportunities for investigators and healthcare providers to develop mutual trust and respect with the community.

Research Questions

The current study sought to evaluate the impact of the dementia friendly model of community engagement on the acquisition and retention of AD-related knowledge, as compared to a more traditional approach of delivering community education. We hypothesized that the collaborative framework of the dementia friendly approach to AD awareness, primarily through conducting focus groups and interviews, would facilitate long-term internalization and retention of AD knowledge by community members to a greater degree than an outreach model in which a community lecture was followed immediately by an informal reception where participants have an opportunity to interact informally with the speaker and outreach staff.

Methods

Setting

Duval County in Northeast Florida is divided into six health zones based on geography and resident demographics. Health Zone 1 is located in and around the urban core and experiences the highest degree of health disparities in all of Duval County. The area is predominantly African American, has a high poverty rate and low high school graduation rate, in addition to poor health outcomes [22]. Two neighborhoods in Health Zone 1 were selected for this study: one for the intervention group and one for the comparison group. As shown in Table 1, the two neighborhoods had comparable numbers of older African American residents. The neighborhoods were in close proximity to each other (approximately 3 miles away) and the locations where the study took place (i.e., a senior center and a middle school) were well known and easily accessible to community members.

Participant Recruitment

Participants from both neighborhoods were recruited through local resources and community partners that have existing relationships with the institution where the study investigators are affiliated. Community partners included city senior centers, community health &amp; wellness centers, recreation centers, health-disparities programs, and faith-based organizations. Key volunteers, known as “project champions” were identified within the intervention and comparison communities to assist in recruiting community members to participate in the study. Methods of recruitment included posting and distribution of flyers and word of mouth through phone calls and text messages.

Study Design

This study used a quasi-experimental design with an intervention and comparison group. (See Figure 1.) Both the intervention and comparison groups attended identical 40-minute presentations delivered by study investigators covering basic facts regarding dementia and AD. The presentation covered issues related to warning signs, risk factors, prevalence data, and differential causes of dementia, as well as healthy brain aging tips. All groups were asked to complete a survey of AD knowledge before the presentation began, and again immediately following the presentation. Each group then participated in a second hour of programming. The intervention group was divided into focus group sessions in which study personnel engaged participants in a structured discussion on the ways in which their community was meeting and not meeting the needs of people with dementia. In contrast, the comparison group engaged in a catered social hour where they could mingle with study personnel and ask questions at their discretion.

Two months after the dementia presentation, participants returned for a second meeting at their respective locations. Before the meeting began, participants completed the knowledge survey again.

Intervention Condition.

A total of 103 community stakeholders participated in the intervention condition. Of these, 94 completed the pre-test and immediate post-test AD knowledge survey, 48 of whom completed the survey again two months later. Participants in the intervention group included community residents with AD, current and former family care partners of people living with AD, professional caregivers of people living with AD, active and retired local healthcare providers, faith leaders, business community members, civic leaders, and neighborhood residents. Sector-based questionnaires were obtained from the Dementia Friendly America Toolkit [23] and reviewed by the African American Community Advisory Board of the Mayo Clinic ADRC, who guided modification of content and language to optimize use in the local community of interest.

Comparison Condition.

A total of 78 community stakeholders attended presentations in the comparison condition. Of these, 76 completed the pre-test and immediate post-test AD knowledge survey, 48 of whom returned two months later to complete the survey again. Similar to the intervention group, participants in the comparison condition included neighborhood residents with dementia, caregivers of people with AD, faith leaders, business owners, and community members.

Measures

Knowledge of AD.

Seven true or false questions from the Alzheimer’s Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) [24] were adapted to assess participants’ knowledge of AD. The ADKS has adequate reliability (test-retest correlation = .81 and internal consistency reliability = .71). The questions included in this study were reviewed by a community advisory board comprised of African American stakeholders from various sectors across the city of Jacksonville. Advisors suggested alternative wording to some items, to promote better understanding and increase response rates of participants. The final version of the scale used in the study contained the following questions: (1) “Alzheimer’s disease is only one of several types of dementia”; (2) “Trouble handling money or paying bills is a common early sign of Alzheimer’s”; (3) “Mental exercise can prevent Alzheimer’s disease”; (4) “African Americans are at greater risk of getting Alzheimer’s than other folks”; (5) “It’s helpful to point out when someone with Alzheimer’s is repeating themselves”; (6) “Memory loss from Alzheimer’s disease is a normal part of getting old”; and (7) “Alzheimer’s disease cannot be cured”. The responses to each question were summed to create a raw score from 0 (no correct responses) to 7 (all correct responses).

Perceived understanding.

An item was added to the ADKS asking participants to rate their own self-reported level of understanding of AD using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Excellent to Poor.

Analytical Sample

A total of 168 participants took part in the study at baseline: 93 (55%) of participants were in the intervention group, while 75 (45%) were in the comparison group. We retained a total of 96 participants who had complete data at baseline, immediate post-test, and at the two-month follow-up. We excluded participants who reported having dementia (n=11) due to the impact of their disease on retention of information over time. We also excluded those with perfect scores at baseline (n=8), as potential for them to benefit from the information provided in the educational presentation was limited. The final analytical sample consisted of 77 participants: 40 participants in the intervention group and 37 in the comparison group. For both the intervention and the comparison groups, characteristics (i.e., age, gender, education, caregiver status and pre-test scores) of participants who did not complete follow-up were not statistically different from participants who returned two months later.

Data Analysis

All analyses were performed using R version 3.6.2 [25]. Data were descriptively summarized separately for the two study groups (intervention and comparison). Numeric variables were summarized with the sample mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables were summarized with the frequency and percentage of participants. We explored differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups using Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables, Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordered categorical variables, and independent sample t-tests for numeric variables. Changes in knowledge scores within groups from pre- to post-intervention were investigated using paired sample t-tests. Confidence intervals were obtained corresponding to both types of t-test. The primary analysis required estimation of the differences in knowledge scores from pre- to post-intervention. So as to adjust for baseline variables in the two groups we used linear regression for this analysis. Specifically, the response variable was the change in knowledge score from pre- to post, and the independent variables were group (1 = intervention, 0 = control), pre-intervention knowledge score, age, and caregiver status (1 = yes, 0 = no). The estimated coefficient of the binary ‘group’ variable represented the difference in changes between the two groups. Confidence intervals for the coefficient were obtained along with the result of the test of the null hypothesis that the true value was zero, i.e. no difference between groups. The same regression analysis was conducted for the time periods of pre- to 2 months post-testing, and from immediate post-testing to 2 months post-testing. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Participant characteristics are presented in Table 2. The type of participants significantly differed by study condition. The majority of participants in the intervention group were AD care partners (60%), while the majority of participants in the comparison group were community residents (78%). Participants in the intervention group were also significantly younger than those in the comparison group (mean of 64.9 vs. 73.5, t(75) = −3.60, p&lt;0.001). However, participants in the two groups were similar with respect to other variables. Caregiver status (care partner vs. other) and age were used as covariates in the primary analyses. The majority of participants believed that they had a “Good” or “Fair” understanding of AD. The two groups had comparable knowledge scores at baseline.

Table 3 shows the AD knowledge means at pre-test and each post-test time point by study condition. No significant difference in AD knowledge was observed between the intervention group (M= 4.50, SD =1.20) and comparison group (M=4.24, SD=1.26) at baseline pre-test (t(75) =0.92, P=0.362). At immediate post-test, both the intervention group and the comparison group improved their scores (M= 5.80, SD=1.11 vs. M=5.35, SD=1.14, respectively), but there was again no statistically significant difference between groups (t(75) =1.75, P=.08). At two-month post-testing, both groups declined in their knowledge scores, but the comparison group declined more precipitously, yielding a significant group mean difference (t(75) =2.36, P=0.021). Subsequent analyses revealed that the main effect at two-month post-testing was not due to group differences in age or caregiver status (i.e., caregiver vs. non-caregiver).

Intra-group comparisons across the three time points are presented in Table 4 and confirm that scores obtained by the intervention group at two-month follow-up remained significantly higher than scores obtained at pre-test (t(39) =4.23, p&lt;0.001). Follow-up scores were not significantly different from scores obtained at immediate post-test (t(39) = −1.92, p=0.062). In contrast, scores obtained by the comparison group at two-month follow-up were no longer significantly different from baseline pre-test knowledge (t(36) =1.74, p=0.91) and were significantly lower than scores obtained at immediate post-test (t(36) = −2.78, p = 0.009).

Discussion

The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of two different approaches to dementia outreach in an African American community. Specifically, a traditional model of providing an educational lecture series was compared to a novel model of applying the Dementia Friendly America toolkit to assess their relative impact on retention of AD-related knowledge over time. The results of this study confirm our hypothesis that the collaborative framework of the dementia friendly approach (i.e., conducting focus groups and interviews following an identical lecture on AD), may help community-dwelling individuals better retain newly encountered AD knowledge over time.

Both models of outreach resulted in similar improvements in AD knowledge immediately following the same presentation of information. If data collection had ended at this point, one might conclude that the time, effort, and resources required to engage community participants in subsequent focus groups may not be necessary. However, by implementing a longer-term follow-up evaluation we have demonstrated that the investment of time and resources into active engagement and discussion following a dementia education presentation may have the tangible benefit of better consolidating the information that was presented. This investment represents an effective option for investigators and community outreach coordinators to provide dementia education to African Americans that will be sustained over time.

The findings of this study are tempered by some methodologic and statistical limitations that may have influenced our outcomes. From a statistical perspective, individual level randomization of participants was not possible for the community-level group-based intervention under study. As such, groups were not comparable with regard to age or proportion of people who identified as having been a caregiver for a loved one with dementia. Although these group mean differences were managed statistically, the study findings would be more robust if participant responses within in each group had been entirely independent. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of unanticipated and unmeasured differences between the communities in the study as potential contributing factors to the observed statistical differences in knowledge retention.

Educating the community on AD is an important step in addressing existing dementia-related health disparities among African Americans. Education is also important to reducing stigma about AD, promoting the quality of life of people with AD and their care partners, and encouraging African Americans to enroll in AD clinical trials [26,27]. Promoting the long-term retention of important dementia-related information through community engagement as demonstrated with the dementia friendly community model applied in this study can be an important tool in the journey to greater health equity.

Although this study employed formal focus groups, it is possible that encouraging active information processing via less formal or effortful methods could yield similar results in long-term retention of dementia-related health information among African American community residents. For example, audience members could be asked to complete a brief post-test quiz together in break out groups, after which the presenter could encourage groups to share and explain their answers. Alternatively, to embody the Dementia Friendly America theme of encouraging communities to better understand the challenges faced by those with dementia, it may be helpful to personalize information during key points of an educational presentation. For example, audience members could be encouraged to think of a specific older person they know (or used to know) and consider how the information being presented might apply to that person. Additional study of these and related strategies to strengthen exposure and facilitate processing of information can further advance the development of innovative, effective, and economical methods to increase retention and utilization of information provided through dementia outreach in African American communities.
