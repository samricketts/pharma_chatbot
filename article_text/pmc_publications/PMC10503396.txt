Since brain network organization is essentially governed by the harmonic waves derived from the Eigen-system of the underlying Laplacian matrix, discovering the harmonic-based alterations provides a new window to understand the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a unified reference space. However, current reference (common harmonic waves) estimation studies over the individual harmonic waves are often sensitive to outliers, which are obtained by averaging the heterogenous individual brain networks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel manifold learning approach to identify a set of outlier-immunized common harmonic waves. The backbone of our framework is calculating the geometric median of all individual harmonic waves on the Stiefel manifold, instead of Fréchet mean, thus improving the robustness of learned common harmonic waves to the outliers. A manifold optimization scheme with theoretically guaranteed convergence is tailored to solve our method. The experimental results on synthetic data and real data demonstrate that the common harmonic waves learned by our approach are not only more robust to the outliers than the state-of-the-art methods, but also provide a putative imaging biomarker to predict the early stage of AD.

pmcI. Introduction

ALZHEIMER’S disease (AD), characterized by memory loss and cognitive abnormalities, is one of the most common forms of dementia [1], [2]. The World Alzheimer Report 2018 [3] reported that there are 50 million people all the world lived with dementia. As a result, the sustainable development of society is affected. More importantly, the neuropathological mechanism of AD is still unknown, and no treatment has been developed to reverse or stop the progression of AD [4], [5]. Therefore, an increasing number of studies have turned their attention to predicting AD at an early stage so that appropriate interventions can be used to slow down its progression [6]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a mid-prodromal period of memory impairment that is often considered a transitional state from a healthy individual to an individual with AD [7]. The accurate identification of MCI patients who will progress to AD is essential to exert possible therapeutic interventions to delay this progression. However, the early prediction of AD remains a difficult challenge, since MCI exhibits substantial individual heterogeneity and mild symptoms.

Abnormal connectivity between distinct brain regions manifests much earlier than the emergence of the earliest symptoms of AD; thus, accurately identifying brain network changes facilitates the early prediction of AD [8]. The rapid development of noninvasive neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques allows us to capture multimodal brain images from the same samples, providing an efficient, feasible, and noninvasive way to investigate structural brain connectivity in vivo, which is consisted of the number of white matter fiber connections between underlying regions of interest (ROIs) [9], [10].

Due to the high dimensionality of brain connectome data, it is a common practice to analyze node-wise graph variables such as local clustering coefficient, centrality, efficiency, modularity and small-worldness, instead of using whole-brain connectivity information. For instance, He et al. [11] found increased clustering coefficient and shortest paths in AD, implying an abnormal small-world property; Yao et al. [12] found the greatest clustering coefficient and the longest absolute path length in AD; Tijms et al. [13] found decreased small-world index in AD; Pereira et al. [14] found that all patient groups exhibited increased path length, reduced transitivity, and increased modularity, and the patient group showed decreased small-world index. By doing so, however, it becomes difficult to discover topological patterns which is an essential aspect of network analyses [15]. Furthermore, brain network changes have been proven to be correlated with the underlying structural pathology [16]. In addition, the unique propagation patterns in existing large-scale brain networks mainly drive the abnormal deposition of AD pathologies [17], [18], [19], [20]. There are an increasing number of brain network analyses focusing on investigating the attributes of brain networks [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].

Recently, many studies have applied the graph Laplacian operator to the adjacency matrix of each individual brain for the purpose of studying the spreading process of neuropathological events of neurodegenerative diseases [26], [27], [28]. The eigensystem of the underlying Laplacian matrix, which is referred to as harmonic waves in this paper, reveals the propagation property of the brain network [29], [30], [31] (shown in the left part of Fig. 1). Combined with the orthogonality of harmonic waves, it is possible to distinguish different clinical cohorts by examining alterations based on harmonic waves. In summary, common harmonic waves obtained by unifying individual eigensystems are required to achieve classification. Although treating the high-dimensional brain networks as regular matrices and applying Euclidean algebra to them to obtain the average brain network is straightforward, such an approach destroys the essential network topological structure of the resulting group-mean brain network (demonstrated in the upper right of Fig. 1). Since each eigensystem of the brain network is an orthogonal matrix, which is considered to be a point on the Stiefel manifold, it provides the possibility to estimate the common harmonic waves by finding the manifold center of all those individual eigensystems on the Stiefel manifold, as illustrated in the lower part in Fig. 1. To this end, the manifold analysis methods are proposed to solve the eigensystem on the manifold. For example, Huang et al. [32] proposed polynomial expansion method of the Laplace-Beltrami operator to obtain the eigensystem and use it to solve heat diffusion on a manifold. Chen et al. [33] proposed a manifold-based harmonic network analysis approach to identify a set of region-adaptive harmonic wavelets that represent the common network topology across individuals.

However, the methods mentioned above ignore the influence of outliers. The outliers in brain network data will severely affect the estimation of manifold centrality. A straightforward solution is outlier deletion; however, this approach is not appropriate for the analysis of a few brain network samples [34]. In this regard, Chen et al. [35] proposed the estimation of the common harmonic waves by calculating the Fréchet mean, where each single harmonic wave represents a unique brain network neuropathological burden spreading pattern. Unfortunately, the Fréchet mean is sensitive to outliers since any point located on the manifold is dragged to infinity without bound. Therefore, designing an outlier-immunized center estimator to identify the common harmonic waves on a Stiefel manifold remains unsolved.

To address this challenge, instead of using a rigid averaging operation on Euclidean space, as demonstrated in Fig. 1, we propose a novel manifold harmonic learning approach to derive outlier-immunized common harmonic waves for each individual wave on a Stiefel manifold. Our method aims to calculate the geometric median of the population harmonic waves, which is formulated as an optimization problem to find manifold centers by minimizing the geodesic distance across all individual waves on the Stiefel manifold. Numerical schemes are designed to iteratively solve the minimization problem on the manifold, and its convergence is theoretically proven. We show that the geometric median is a robust estimator of centrality and thus avoids outlier corruption. After obtaining the common harmonic waves of the network population, we assess its statistical performance on both synthetic data and ADNI neuroimaging data. Extensive experiments on synthetic data have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves superior identification accuracy in estimating the common harmonic waves containing an increased number of brain network outliers. For real data, our manifold learning approach achieves higher discriminatory power than the other comparative methods in distinguishing cognitively normal (CN), early-stage mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and late-stage mild cognitive impairment (LMCI). Finally, we identify a set of neuroimaging biomarkers derived from the significant common harmonic waves that are highly associated with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, a clinical test to measure cognitive impairment. Our study provides three main contributions:

We develop a novel manifold learning approach to estimate outlier-immunized common harmonic waves by calculating the geometric median, which shows better robustness to outliers than arithmetic mean or Fréchet mean in constructing the group mean.

A specialized manifold optimization algorithm for our proposed method is designed to ensure that the optimal numerical solution is obtained. Its theoretical proof of convergence is elaborated.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher diagnostic performance than other baseline methods but also identifies a new neuroimaging biomarker to predict the risk of progressing AD at the preclinical phase.

The organization of this article is as follows. The proposed method and its theoretical convergent-guaranteed numerical scheme are introduced in Section II. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and ADNI neuroimaging data are presented in Section III. A further discussion of the proposed method and experimental results is proposed in Section IV. The conclusion is given in Section V.

II. Method

The problem statement and mathematical modeling for estimating the outlier-immunized common harmonic waves is first explained in Section II-A. Then, the common harmonic wave optimization scheme is presented in Section II-B. Finally, the application of harmonic wave analysis is given in Section II-C. The notation is summarized in Table I.

A. Problem Statement and Mathematical Modeling

Generally, we adopt a graph representation 𝒢=(V,ε,W) to encode a complex brain network, where V={vi∣i∈1,…N} is the node set, and N stands for the number of nodes. Edge set ε={eij∣vi,vj} represents the set of all possible connections between nodes. The weighted adjacency matrix W=[wi,j]N×N∈RN×N is used to store the connection strength between node i and node j.

The individual harmonic waves Φ∈RN×P, which is the eigensystem of the Laplacian matrix, can be solved by the following minimization [35]: (1) minΦ∈RN×PTr(ΦTLΦ)s.t.ΦTΦ=IP

where Tr(⋅) stands for the trace norm and IP∈RP×P is the identity matrix. A symmetry graph Laplacian matrix can be obtained by L=D−W, where D is the diagonal matrix. Each diagonal element D(i,i)=∑j=1Nwij in matrix D is represented as the summation of the connection strength between node i and its connected nodes. Note that the individual harmonic waves Φ={φ1,φ2,…,φP} are sorted column by column from low to high frequency {λp∣p=1,…,P,λ1≤λ2≤⋯≤λP} [36], showing that as the eigenvalue increases, the harmonic wave exhibits faster oscillatory patterns. We only reserve the top P(P&lt;N) harmonic waves for each brain network, since the higher frequency harmonic waves tend to be sensitive to potential noise. Assuming that a set of individual harmonic waves Φ is an orthogonal matrix of N×P, Φ derived from a single brain network is reasonable to be treated as an instance on the Stiefel manifold [37].

Given the m brain network 𝒢s(s=1,…,m), the individual harmonic waves Φs can be optimized based on the energy function in (1). Our goal is to estimate the common harmonic waves Ψ by unifying the individual eigensystems from individual harmonic waves {Φs∣s=1,…,m}. Specifically, we estimated the common harmonics by finding the Fréchet mean, which has the shortest l2-norm geodesic distances to all observation points residing on the Stiefel manifold. Since Fréchet mean has been shown to be susceptible to outliers [34], we adopted a geometric median estimator to address this impact. This estimator can be used to effectively reduce the influence of outliers by calculating the l1-norm geodesic distance instead of the l2-norm geodesic distances. Therefore, the geometric median can be obtained by minimizing the summation of the l1-norm geodesic distances to all individual harmonic waves {Φs}, (2) arg minΨ∑s=1md(Φs,Ψ)=arg minΨ∑s=1mP−Tr(ΦsTΨ)

where d(⋅) represents the l1-norm geodesic distance, which is approximated by d(Φs,Ψ)=P−Tr(ΦsTΨ) [35]. As a result, by combining (1) and (2), the objective function is formulated as: (3) min{Φs},Ψ∑s=1m{Tr(ΦsTLsΨs)+βP−Tr(ΦsTΨ)}s.t.∀s:ΦsTΦs=IP

where β is a scalar balancing of two terms in (3). The first term is used to ensure that each individual harmonic wave Φs retains the topological structure of its own brain network. The second term ensures that the estimated common harmonic waves Ψ have the shortest geodesic distance summation to all individual harmonic waves {Φs}. The orthogonal constraint term can guarantee that all adjusted individual harmonic wave {Φs} is still located on the Stiefel manifold.

B. Numerical Scheme

We propose using the gradient descent method under the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework on the manifold [35] to solve the problem. Rewriting the constrained problem as an unconstrained minimization problem, the Lagrangian function is obtained as follows: (4) min{Φs},Ψ∑s=1mFΦs,Ψ=min{Φs},Ψ∑s=1m{Tr(ΦsTLsΦs)}{+βP−Tr(ΦsTΨ)+Tr(ΛsT(ΦsTΦs−IP))}

where Λs is the Lagrangian matrix.

We solve the Lagrangian function in (4) by the following two steps.

Step 1: Optimize all individual harmonic waves {Φs} by fixing the common harmonic waves Ψ:

Since each individual harmonic wave Φs is independent, we can optimize each individual harmonic wave Φs separately by simplifying (4) as: (5) minΦsFΦs=minΦs{Tr(ΦsTLsΨs)+βP−Tr(ΦsTΨ)+Tr(ΛsT(ΦsTΦs−IP))}

By setting the gradient ∇F to zero, we obtain: (6) ∂FΦs∂Φs=2LsΦs−βINΨ2(P−Tr(ΦsTΨ))+2ΦsΛsT=0

Since the objective function (5) is nonconvex and the Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) condition (6) with the square root term as the denominator is hard to solve, we adopt the following method [38], [39] to solve (5).

By introducing a specific Lagrangian multiplier θ for the third item, we obtain a partial Lagrangian relaxation (PLR, fθ(Φs)) form for the energy function (5): (7) minΦs{Tr(LsΦsΦsT)+{βTr(IP−ΦsTΨ)+θ(P−Tr(ΦsTΦs))}s.t.(INΦsΦsTIP)≻¯0

By choosing appropriate Lagrangian multiplier θ [40], fθ(Φs) is a convex conic program problem that can be easily solved by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm [41], [42]. The procedure of optimizing individual harmonic waves Φs includes the following four steps:

Initialize the parameters i=1, H=100.

Update θi←θmin+(i−1)θmax−θminH, i=1,…,H

Apply the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to obtain an optimal solution Φs∗ of the Lagrangian function fθi(Φs) regarding θi.

Iteratively perform steps (2)-(3) until the {Φs∗}TΦs∗=IP constraint is satisfied.

Step 2: Optimize common harmonic waves Ψ while fixing all individual harmonic waves {Φs}:

Given all adjusted individual harmonic waves {Φs}, estimating the common harmonic waves Ψ falls into solving the geometric median on the Stiefel manifold. The objective function of solving common harmonic waves Ψ becomes: (8) minΨFΨ=minΨ∑s=1md(Φs,Ψ)=minΨ∑s=1mP−Tr(ΦsTΨ)

Therefore, we can adopt the Weiszfeld algorithm [43] to efficiently solve the problem in (8) by alternately performing the following two steps until convergence:

Given the k-th estimated manifold center Ψ(k) (purple circle in Fig. 2), the gradient of the energy function d(Φs,Ψ(k)) at Ψ(k) on the Stiefel manifold can be calculated as ∇Ψ(k)d(Φs,Ψ(k))∈𝒯Ψ(k)ℳ, where 𝒯Ψ(k)ℳ is the tangent plane at Ψ(k) (shown as the green flat plane in Fig. 2). Therefore, we can obtain the manifold gradient ∇Ψ(k)d(Φs,Ψ(k))=(Ψ(k)ΦsTΨ(k)−Φs)∕P−Tr(ΦsTΨ(k)) by [43] (blue solid arrow in Fig. 2). Finally, the mean tangent ΔΨ(k+1)∈𝒯Ψ(k)ℳ (red triangle in Fig. 2) is: (9) ΔΨ(k+1)=−∇Ψ(k)∑s=1md(Φs,Ψ(k))=−∑s=1mΨ(k)ΦsTΨ(k)−ΦsP−Tr(ΦsTΨ(k))

Map ΔΨ(k+1) back to the Stiefel manifold by the Riemannian exponential map in (10) to obtain the updated manifold center (red circle in Fig. 2). (10) Ψ(k+1)=expΨ(k)(γΔΨ(k+1))

It is worth noting that our proposed method penalizes the tangent vectors of outlier in the optimization process, as shown by the black solid arrow in Fig. 2, because they have a larger distance to the underlying manifold center. This property makes our proposed method more robust to outlier influence than other approaches. Finally, the entire optimization scheme is summarized in the algorithm 1. We also discuss the parameter tuning, computational complexity analysis, and convergen analysis of our proposed method in section IV.

C. Harmonic Waves Analysis

Empirical biomarkers (e.g., amyloid or tau deposition) are typically applied to predict early-stage AD in the traditional neuroimaging studies. Those empirical biomarkers can always be denoted as a column vector f∈RN for each subject. Nowadays, manifold harmonic analysis is proposed to identify the harmonic-based alterations, which are related to the propagation pathways of neuropathological burdens. Therefore, the outlier-immunized common harmonic waves Ψ learned by our proposed method can be used to develop a new neuroimaging biomarker for each instance f by: (11) E(ψp)=∣〈f,ψp〉∣2

Using the physics concept of harmonics, each E(ψp) presents the harmonic energy propagating the neuropathology burden f through the underlying harmonic wave ψp. In Section III-C2, we demonstrate that our proposed new neuroimaging biomarkers achieve enhanced performance in group stratification than existing empirical biomarkers.

III. Experiments and Results

To evaluate the performance of our proposed harmonic analysis method, we compare the common harmonic waves optimized by our approach with the benchmark and the other groups of harmonic waves generated by the following methods: 1) Traditional method Ψo: directly using the empirical biomarkers for classification; 2) Arithmetic mean Ψa: simply averaging individual eigenvectors; 3) Pseudo manifold mean Ψp: applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to the Laplacian matrix of the average adjacency matrix [30]; 4) Polynomial approximation Ψc: the polynomial approximation of the average of Laplace-Beltrami operator [32]; 5) Fréchet mean Ψf: estimating the Fréchet mean of all individual harmonic waves [35]. In addition, we refer to our method as the geometric median Ψg.

In our experimental setting, we first measure the performance of our manifold learning method in estimating the common harmonic waves in terms of outliers in Sections III-B1 and III-B2. Then, the replicability of our learned common harmonic waves is evaluated in Section III-C1. Next, the diagnostic ability of our proposed new neuroimaging biomarkers in classifying CN, EMCI and LMCI subjects is investigated in Section III-C2. Furthermore, the outlier-immunized common harmonic waves are applied to discover harmonic-based alterations (significant neuroimaging biomarkers) in Section III-C3. Finally, we apply the general linear model (GLM) to evaluate the association between significant neuroimaging biomarkers and MMSE score in Section III-C4.

A. Image Acquisition and Data Preprocessing

We have collected neuroimaging data in the ADNI database, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1-weighted MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images from 94 subjects. First, according to a Desctrieux atlas [44], we parcellate the cortical surface into 148 cortical regions based T1-weighted MRI images. Second, a 148×148 anatomical connectivity matrix is produced by applying surface seed-based probabilistic fiber tractography on the DTI images. Finally, the structural brain network is derived from the anatomical connectivity matrix, where the weight of the anatomical connectivity is defined by the number of fibers linking two brain regions normalized by the total number of fibers in the whole brain [44]. The outlier-immunized common harmonic waves Ψ are estimated by applying our proposed harmonic learning approach on above neuroimaging data. After obtaining the common harmonic waves Ψ, there are another three ADNI datasets selected for group comparison. The imaging modalities of those three datasets are amyloid-PET, tau-PET and FDG-PET respectively, and the statistical information is in Table II. For PET imaging data, the cortical surface was parcellated into 148 structural brain regions, thus the standard update value ratio (SUVR) for each region is assembled into the column vector f.

B. Experiments on Synthetic Data

1) Evaluating the Accuracy of Common Harmonic Waves:

Here, we are interested in evaluating the accuracy of identifying manifold centers vias different methods, including the arithmetic mean Ψa, the Fréchet mean Ψf, and our geometric median Ψg. In this context, we generate a series of low-dimensional synthetic data by the following steps. We randomly synthesize fifteen three-dimensional orthonormal matrices as individual harmonic waves (in blue in Fig. 3) and two matrices as outliers (in yellow in Fig. 3), which can be represented as the points located on the Stiefel manifold (shown in Fig. 3(e)). Specifically, we first provide the ground truth (identity matrix), which is displayed in green in Fig. 3(a). Then, the orthonormal matrices are obtained by rotating the identify matrix with a given rotation axis and angles. The rotation angles are sampled from the Gaussian distribution with mean μ = 0 and standard deviation ξ = π/15.

Since the adjacency matrices are not provided in synthetic data, the pseudo manifold mean Ψp is not appropriate for comparison here. Consequently, the manifold centers (common harmonic waves) evaluated via the arithmetic mean Ψa, the Fréchet mean Ψf, and our geometric median Ψg from above-mentioned seventeen orthonormal matrices (including two outliers) are exhibited in Fig. 3(b), (c) and (d), respectively. It is apparent that 1) the geometric median Ψg is much closer to the ground truth than the other manifold center estimation methods; 2) the arithmetic mean Ψa is outside the Stiefel manifold, indicating that the arithmetic mean is no longer an orthogonal matrix; and 3) the geometric median can quickly converge to the potential manifold center and be more robust to the outlier issue than the Fréchet mean, as illustrated in the purple (Fréchet mean) and red (geometric median) convergence trajectories in Fig. 3(e).

2) Evaluating the Robustness to Outliers:

In this section, to further evaluate the performance of our method on the outlier issue, we construct an experiment to estimate the accuracy of the manifold center estimation by gradually increasing outliers. Specifically, we repeat the following procedure 100 times: 1) we generate 100 three-dimensional orthonormal matrices (including t% random outliers) based on the processing steps described in Section III-B1; 2) we apply our method and Ψf to these orthonormal matrices to estimate the manifold center; we calculate the accuracy by calculating the l1-norm geodesic distance between the estimated center and ground truth. Finally, the accuracy (mean and standard deviation) for estimating the manifold center with a proportion of outliers ranging from 0.02 to 0.35 is plotted in Fig. 4.

The experimental results demonstrate that 1) the l1-norm geodesic distance between the manifold center detected by our geometric median and ground truth is significantly smaller (p &lt; 0.0001) than that of the Fréchet mean, indicating that our method outperforms the Fréchet mean in identifying manifold centers; 2) with the increase in the outliers, the accuracy of the Fréchet mean drops sharply, while our method can maintain a high accuracy, indicating that our method has better robustness than the Fréchet mean in terms of outliers.

C. Experiments on the ADNI Dataset

1) Evaluating the Replicability of Common Harmonic Waves:

In this experiment, we construct a reproducible experiment to evaluate the stability of our proposed method in discovering common harmonic waves. Specifically, we generate 100 test/retest datasets by the following resample procedure: 1) we select 60 brain networks from the total 94 brain networks as a common group and 20 subjects from the remaining 34 subjects for subsequent analysis; 2) we divide the 20 subjects into two specific groups, where each group includes 10 subjects; 3) we combine the common group and two specific groups to form two paired cohorts, each with 70 subjects. Finally, we evaluate the common harmonic waves by the proposed method on these two datasets independently. Since two cohorts have more than 80%(10/70) overlapped brain networks, we can assume that similar common harmonic waves should be obtained by applying our method to these two cohorts. In this context, we evaluate replicability by testing whether each element in the harmonic matrix was significantly different (p &lt; 0.01) via the paired t-test. Since each specific brain region corresponds to a row in the harmonic matrix, we count the number of elements that fail the replicability test at each row and map them to the cortical surface, as shown in Fig. 5.

From the experimental results, we observe that 1) the pseudo manifold mean Ψp achieves the worst replicability performance; 2) geometric median Ψg has a smaller number of brain regions that fail the replicability test than the Fréchet mean Ψf, indicating that geometric median has enhanced performance in replicability; 3) the arithmetic mean Ψa achieves similar replicability performance as our method, however, the orthogonality of arithmetic mean is often not guaranteed, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(b). Such nonorthogonality of the arithmetic mean will destroy the topological structure of the brain network, thereby affecting the classification performance, which will be demonstrated in Section III-C2; 4) though the polynomial approximation Ψc shows equivalent replicability as our method, the replicability of the left brain part of the polynomial approximation Ψc is far from the right brain part. Compared with the pseudo manifold mean Ψp, the polynomial approximation Ψc greatly improves the replicability, which indicates that the polynomial approximation has a promoting effect on replicability.

2) Evaluating the Diagnostic Performance of Common Harmonic Waves:

In this section, we estimate the diagnostic potential of our proposed neuroimaging biomarkers in CN, EMCI, and LMCI stratification. Since the traditional neuroimaging analysis methods widely use the region-wise SUVR score calculated from PET imaging data to predict the early-stage AD, these empirical biomarkers can serve as benchmark to measure our neuroimaging biomarkers. In addition, the harmonic features extracted by the arithmetic mean Ψa, the pseudo manifold mean Ψp, the Fréchet mean Ψf, and the polynomial approximation Ψc are also compared with our proposed method in this experiment. Specifically, the linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained independently using the empirical biomarkers and neuroimaging biomarkers as input. Then, we can obtain the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and area under the precision-recall (AUPR) curve scores using 10-fold cross-validation.

The Fig. 6 shows the classification results of different neuroimaging biomarkers and empirical biomarkers on three group comparisons (CN/EMCI, EMCI/LMCI, and CN/LMCI) in PET imaging data. It is clear that 1) the neuroimaging biomarkers based on geometric median Ψf achieve the best classification performance (highest AUROC and AUPR scores) over all other methods for three different PET imaging data, where star ‘*’ or ‘**’ indicates that our results are significantly better than those of the compared methods with p &lt; 0.1 or p &lt; 0.01 based on the between-area correlation; 2) the Stiefel means, including the Fréchet mean Ψf and the geometric median Ψg, outperform other means estimated in Euclidean space; 3) the performance of polynomial approximation Ψc is similar as the Fréchet mean Ψf, but it is still secondary to our approach; and 4) the AUROC and AUPR scores on FDG-PET data are lower than the other two PET imaging data (amyloid-PET and tau-PET). This is mainly because the FDG energy differences among CN, EMCI and LMCI are too small to influence the classification performance, which will be shown in Fig. 7. However, our proposed neuroimaging biomarkers still achieve higher classification accuracy than other methods and outperform the empirical biomarkers, indicating the great potential of applying our outlier-immunized common harmonic waves in the early diagnosis of AD.

3) Identifying Harmonic-Based Alterations on PET Imaging Data:

Given the outlier-immunized common harmonic waves Ψg estimated by our proposed method, the new neuroimaging biomarkers can be extracted by (11). Since their effective classification ability has been validated in Section III-C2, we further investigate the harmonic-based alterations (significant neuroimaging biomarkers) that are related with the development and progression of AD.

For amyloid data, the total harmonic energy for each instance is firstly calculated via E=∑p=1PE(ψp), and then the total energy boxplot for the CN, EMCI and LMCI patient groups is shown in Fig. 7(a), where the total energy of the LMCI group is significantly higher (p &lt; 10−4) than that of the CN and EMCI groups. However, we cannot find a significant total energy difference (p = 0.0369 &gt; 0.01) between the CN and EMCI patient groups. Moreover, we visualize the distribution of total harmonic energy in Fig. 7(b), with similar findings as the boxplot. Second, we measure the average energy of each harmonic wave for CN and LMCI group, as shown in the second and first layers in Fig. 7(c). Additionally, the corresponding Fisher score JF is calculated to express the energy difference magnitude for each harmonic wave, which is illustrated in the third layer in Fig. 7(c), where the common harmonic waves showing the significant energy difference (p &lt; 0.01) are tagged with star ‘★’ Furthermore, the energy difference between CN and LMCI at each harmonic wave is shown in Fig. 7(d). For the tau-PET imaging data, the total energy distribution and harmonic-specific energy difference are similar to the results of amyloid data, as shown in Fig. 7(e)-(h). These results demonstrate that the deposition of amyloid peptides and aggregation of tau tangles are associated with the progression of AD. In comparison, for the FDG-PET modality, we observe that the CN group has a significantly higher total energy (p &lt; 0.01) than the LMCI group, while there is no significant total energy difference for the CN/EMCI and EMCI/LMCI comparisons (shown in Fig. 7(i)-(l)). These results show that the harmonic energy level of FDG can reflect the neurodegeneration of AD development. These significant harmonic waves (significant neuroimaging biomarkers) may play important roles in identifying the spreading of pathological burdens across brain networks.

4) Discovering Association Between Clinical Indicators and Significant Neuroimaging Biomarkers:

As described in Section III-C3, some significant neuroimaging biomarkers based on our outlier-immunized common harmonic waves are detected via the t-test on PET imaging data, as shown in Fig. 7(c), (g) and (k). Therefore, we are interested in further research on whether there is a significant association between clinical indicators and our significant neuroimaging biomarkers In this experiment, theGLMis applied to predict the MMSE score using our neuroimaging biomarkers. We select the top 4 significant harmonic waves of each modality forGLManalyses and plot the statistical results in Fig. 8. It is clear that (1) the neuroimaging biomarkers based or the first common harmonic wave ψ1 manifest a significant association (p &lt; 10−6) with the MMSE score on amyloid, tau and FDG data (shown in Fig. 8(a), (h) and (i)). Since the first common harmonic wave is a constant vector, its corresponding neuroimaging biomarker E(ψ1) represents the summation of the SUVR score. These results support the evidence that amyloid deposition, tau aggregation, and FDG levels are hallmarks of AD, which can be used for AD study; (2) The significan neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid-PET (in the top of Fig. 8) anc tau-PET (in the middle of Fig. 8) are negatively correlated with MMSE scores, while the significant neuroimaging biomarkers of FDG-PET (in the bottom of Fig. 8) are positively associated with MMSE scores, which is consistent with the findings in Section III-C3. These results indicate the potential of the new neuroimaging biomarkers identified by our outlier-immunized common harmonic waves in predicting early AD cognitive decline.

IV. Discussion

A. Parameter Pruning

Our proposed method for estimating outlier-immunized common harmonic waves exists three parameters: the harmonic dimension parameter P, the hyperparameter β and the optimized parameter H.

As mentioned in Section II-A, since the higher frequency harmonic waves tend to be sensitive to potential noise, we determine to use only the smallest P eigenvectors ΦsP instead of the whole eigenvectors Φs. According to the reconstruction loss calculated by matrix norm between original Laplacian matrix Ls and the reconstructed Laplacian matrix L^sP=(ΦsP)TΛPΦsP with ΛP as the diagonal matrix of the first P eigen-value of the Laplacian matrix Ls, the dimension P is determined, which is located at the stable point such that the reduction in reconstruction loss is marginal as P increases.

In terms of hyperparameter selection, the grid search method is applied to select the optimal β based on the classification accuracy of real data.

As we have discussed before, the main point of our algorithm is to find an appropriate θ for our solution, θ is more accurate if we have a bigger H, but when we select an oversize H, the time we cost will be too much, and the solution seems to be non-sensitive. Therefore, we determine the parameter by grid search method, we choose H from 10 to 150 with the interval of 10, and identify the optimal H based on the convergence performance of the algorithm.

Finally, we fix the harmonic dimension P=60, the optimal parameter β=0.1 and H=100 in all our experiments.

B. Computational Complexity Analysis

The complexity of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm in algorithm 1 is highly related to that of SVD decomposition and matrix multiplication. In SVD decomposition, U and V are (N×N) and (P×P) matrices, respectively. Constructing these matrices has a time complexity of O(N3), while matrix multiplication has the same time complexity of O(N3). In the whole algorithm, the maximal iteration number is H, and the number of samples is m; therefore, optimizing algorithm 1 has the time complexity of O(mHnN3), where n is the iteration number of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Compared with the other methods, such as the interior-point solver SEDUMI, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm has the lowest time complexity [41], [42]. The inner loop of the algorithm 1 provides all updated individual harmonic waves {Φs} for the external loop of the algorithm 1; thus, the whole algorithm 1 has a time complexity of O(KmHnN3) with K as the iteration number of the algorithm 1.

C. Convergence Analysis

As stated in Section II-B, the numerical scheme is divided into two steps. First, all the individual harmonic waves {Φs} are solved by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. By selecting a series of discrete θ, the objective function (7) is convergent according to Lemma 1 and Lemma 2 in Appendix A. For the set of different θ, we can obtain the convergent solution as proved in Lemma 3 in Appendix A. Second, we adopt the Weiszfeld algorithm to solve common harmonic waves Ψ. Lemma 5 in Appendix A provides a detailed proof of the convergence of the objective function (8). Finally, we can prove that the whole algorithm is convergent, as shown in Theorem 6 in Appendix A.

D. Evaluation of Computational Efficiency and Accuracy

For the sake of studying the computational efficiency and accuracy of different neuroimaging biomarkers, we conduct an experiment examining the computational time and classification accuracy of those existing works with best performance values, arithmetic mean Φa, pseudo manifold mean Φp, polynomial approximation Φc, Fréchet mean Φf and geometric median Φg on synthesized data. The synthesized data is generated by adding the gaussian distribution on the first-given two kinds of 148 × 1 vector, which can be regarded as two different categories. Notably, the outlier is the point that far away from those normal synthesized data. The results are shown in Table III. Those results show that 1) the computational efficiency of Φa and Φp have a significant superiority than the others; 2) the geometric median Φg has achieved the best classification, the Fréchet mean Φf take the second, and the geometric median Φg has the least effect from the outliers, which indicates the robustness of our proposed approach to outliers.

E. Limitations and Future Work

Several limitations of the proposed method should be mentioned. (1) Computational cost: Although the proposed numerical scheme can theoretically guarantee convergence, it is computationally challenging to have large node numbers in the brain network analysis. In our future work, we plan to develop an effective optimization scheme to decrease the computational complexity while maintaining convergence. Such a method will be more reliable and reproducible for increasingly large brain networks. (2) Small samples: Compared to other methods, the experimental results demonstrate the enhanced performance of our estimated outlier-immunized common harmonic waves in the early AD diagnosis. However, our previously proposed common harmonic waves estimation method is still biased. This is mainly because estimating the common harmonic waves with a small number of brain networks in a high-dimensional manifold space is a challenging issue. Therefore, we will collect more brain networks to confirm the unbiased common harmonic waves estimation in the future. (3) Global nature of harmonic waves: Same as the Fourier bases, the common harmonic waves can be used as bases to project the brain signal to the frequency domain for the classification of AD. However, the global nature makes common harmonic waves impossible to discover disease-related brain regions and characterize the local neuropathological burdens propagation patterns. We have made some efforts in terms of harmonic localization [33], [45], however, these methods are still sensitive to outlier contamination. Thus, we will develop our proposed method into the localized common harmonic waves estimation version, which will be more powerful for brain network analysis.

V. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a manifold learning method to estimate outlier-immunized common harmonic waves on the Stiefel manifold. Specifically, we measure the common harmonic waves as the geometric median of all individual harmonic waves. The outlier-immunized common harmonic waves offer a new window to discover the harmonic-based alterations related to AD propagation patterns and develop a new neuroimaging biomarker for forecasting early AD. We have demonstrated that our proposed method is more robust than other comparative approaches in dealing with outliers in synthetic data. In the extensive experiments on the ADNI dataset, our manifold learning approach achieves more consistent and reasonable results than existing methods that simply apply Euclidean operations on brain networks. In our future work, we plan to apply our outlier-immunized common harmonic waves to explore the potential pathogenic mechanism of other neurological disorders.

Appendix A

Lemma 1: When θ≥θmax=λmax−β162NP, fθ(Φs) is a concave program, and only if θ≤θmin=λmin−βP8N(ν)3, fθ(Φs) is a convex conic program.

Proof: When θ≥θmax, ∇fθ(Φs)≺¯0, ∇2fθ(Φs)≺¯0; when θ≤θmin, ∇fθ(Φs)≻¯0, ∇2fθ(Φs)≻¯0. ∇fθ(Φs) and ∇2fθ(Φs) are shown as: (12) ∇fθ(Φs)=2(L−θIN)Φs−βΨ2P−Tr(ΦsTΨ)∇2fθ(Φs)=2(L−θIN)−βPIN4n(P−Tr(ΦsTΨ))3

Consequently, fθ(Φs) is a strictly concave function in terms of Φs when θ≥θmax, and fθ(Φs) is a strictly convex function in terms of Φs when θ≤θmin.■

Lemma 2: The extreme point set of {Φs∈RN×P∣ΦsTΦs≺¯IP} is {Φs∈RN×P∣IP≻¯ΦsTΦs,Tr(ΦsTΦ)=P}

Proof: Let Xs be an extreme point of {Φs∈RN×P∣ΦsTΦs≺¯IP}. The singular value decomposition of Xs is Xs=∑j=1PσjUjVjT, where 0≤σ1≤σ2≤⋯≤σP≤1. Thus, XsTXs=∑j=1Pσj2VjVjT and Tr(XsTXs)=∑j=1Pσj2.

Supposing that σ1&lt;1, we define Y=(2σ1−1)U1V1T+∑j=2PσjUjVjT,Z=U1V1T+∑j=2PσjUjVjT

Then, we have Y≠Z,X=12Y+12Z, and YTY=(2σ1−1)2V1V1T+∑j=2Pσj2VjVjT≺¯∑j=2PVjVjT=IPZTZ=V1V1T+∑j=2Pσj2VjVjT≺¯∑j=2PVjVjT=IP

Therefore, Xs is not the extreme point, and the contradiction proves that σ1=σ2=⋯=σP=1, which completes the proof.■

Lemma 3: The algorithm in Step 1 of Section II-B terminates in at most H iterations.

Proof: For the H-th iteration, θH=θmax; thus, fθH(Φs) in the H-th iteration is a strictly concave function in terms of Φs.

Suppose Φs1TΦs1≺¯IP and Φs∗TΦs∗=IP; thus, Φs∗−Φs1≠0 and fθH(Φs1+α(Φs∗−Φs1)) is strictly concave with respect to the optimal step size α, estimated via line search strategy.

In addition, we have ∇fθH(Φs1)TΦs∗=arg minΦTΦ≺¯IPTr(∇fθH(Φs1)TΦ)≤∇fθH(Φs1)TΦs1

Thus, we conclude that dfθH(Φs1+α(Φs∗−Φs1))dα∣α=0=Tr(∇fθH(Φs1)T(Φs∗−Φs1))≤0

Therefore, fθH(Φs1+α(Φs∗−Φs1)) is strictly decreasing when 0≤α≤1. Consequently, when we take the optimal step size α∗=1, the optimal solution Φst=Φst−1+α∗(Φst−1∗−Φst−1)=Φst−1∗ and hence ΦstTΦst=Ip, which is the convergence criterion. Consequently, the algorithm in Step 1 of Section II-B terminates in at most H iterations.■

Theorem 4: The algorithm in Step 1 of Section II-B is convergent.

Proof: The dual question of solving the objective function (5) is maxθminΦsTΦ≺¯IPfθ(Φs).

Specifically, for any θ1&lt;θ2&lt;⋯&lt;θi&lt;⋯≤θmin, fθ2(Φs2∗)=Tr(LsΦs2∗Φs2∗T)+βTr(IP−Φs2∗TΨ)+θ2(P−Tr(Φs2∗TΦs2∗))&gt;Tr(LsΦs2∗Φs2∗T)+βTr(IP−Φs2∗TΨ)+θ1(P−Tr(Φs2∗TΦs2∗))≥minIP≻¯ΦsTΦsTr(LsΦsΦsT)+βTr(IP−ΦsTΨ)+θ2(P−Tr(ΦsTΦs))=fθ2(Φs2∗)

where Φsi∗ is the optimal solution of minΦsTΦ≺¯IPfθi(Φs), so fθi(Φsi∗) is a strictly increasing function with respect to θ, and fθ1(Φs1∗)&lt;fθ2(Φs2∗)&lt;⋯&lt;fθi(Φsi∗). Therefore, the dual question has no optimal solution when θ&lt;θmin.

In addition, fθ(Φs) is a concave program when θ≥θmax in Lemma 1. Then, for θmax≤θ1&lt;θ2&lt;⋯&lt;θi, the global minimizers of {fθ1(Φs),fθ2(Φs),…,fθi(Φs)} are all attained at an extreme point of the feasible region {Φs∈RN×P∣IP≻¯ΦsTΦs,Tr(ΦsTΦ)=P} in Lemma 2; thus, the optimal values of {fθ1(Φs),fθ2(Φs),…,fθn(Φs)} are all the same as the objective function (5). Therefore, when θ≥θmax, there are infinitely many optimal solutions.

Therefore, these results suggest a continuous method to solve the dual question by obtaining the optimal solution of maxθfθ(Φs∗) for the increasing sequence {θi}∈[θmin,θmax].

Combining Lemma 3, we know that the optimal solution of maxθfθ(Φs∗) appears at most H iterations; therefore, the algorithm in Step 1 of Section II-B is convergent.■

Lemma 5: The numerical scheme using the Weiszfeld updating is as follows: (13) Ψ(k+1)=expΨ(k)(−∑s=1m∇Ψ(k)FΨ)=expΨ(k)=(−∑s=1m(Ψ(k)ΦsTΨ(k)−Φs)(P−Tr(ΦsTΨ(k))))

in solving: (14) FΨ=arg minΨ∑s=1md(Φs,Ψ)=arg minΨ∑s=1mP−Tr(ΦsTΨ)

is convergent.

Proof: For the points Ψ, Φ1, Φ2,…,Φs in the convex set of Stiefel manifold ℳ, we use d(Φ1,Φ2) to denote the geodesic distance between the two points Φ1 and Φ2 on the Stiefel manifold. The k-th iterations in the Weiszfeld algorithm: FΨ(k)=∑s=1md(Ψ(k),Φs)

The corresponding function is defined on the tangent plane: F~Ψ~(k)=∑s=1md(Ψ~(k),Φ~s)

(Ψ~(k+1), Φ~s) is manifold point (Ψ(k+1), Φs) corresponding to the tangent plane point at Ψ(k). Note that −∇ΨFΨ&lt;0, and the exponential map is locally diffeomorphic onto a neighborhood of Ψ(k); therefore: (15) F~Ψ~(k+1)≤F~Ψ~(k)=FΨ(k)

The distance between two points on a positively curved manifold is smaller than the distance between their projections on the tangent plane according to Toponogov’s theorem. This implies: FΨ(k+1)≤F~Ψ~(k+1)≤FΨ(k)

The last inequality is from (15). because the objective function (14) is continuous, the objective function (14) is convergent.■

Theorem 6: The Algorithm 1 is convergent.

Proof: In Theorem 4, we show that Step 1 in Section II-B is convergent, and the convergence of Step 2 in Section II-B is proven in Lemma 5; therefore, it is easy to conclude that the Algorithm 1 is convergent.■

Fig. 1. The traditional methods (blue arrow) identify the average brain network as a standard reference by calculating the arithmetic mean of all adjacency matrices on Euclidean space, which destroy the topological property of brain network. However, our manifold learning method (red arrow) estimates the outlier-immunized common harmonic waves on the Stiefel manifold by calculating the geometric median of all individual harmonic waves (yellow circle), which not only respects the brain network topology but is also insensitive to outliers (gray circle).

Fig. 2. Illustration of optimizing common harmonic waves. Individual harmonic waves {Φs} (yellow circle), an outlier (black circle), and k-th estimated common harmonic waves Ψ(k) (purple circle) are resided on the Stiefel manifold ℳ(N,P) (blue surface). The corresponding projected points (triangles) of individual harmonic waves {Φs} are on the tangent plane 𝒯Ψ(k) (green flat plane) of kth manifold center Ψ(k). The mean tangent (red triangle) is obtained by combining all gradient directions (solid arrow). Finally, map the mean tangent back to the updated manifold center Ψ(k+1) (red circle) on the Stiefel manifold.
