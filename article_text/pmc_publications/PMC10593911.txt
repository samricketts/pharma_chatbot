INTRODUCTION:

We investigated the link between locus coeruleus (LC) pathology and cerebral microangiopathy in two large neuropathology datasets.

METHODS:

We included data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database (n=2197) and Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP; n=1637). Generalized estimating equations and logistic regression were used to examine associations between LC hypopigmentation and presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or arteriolosclerosis, correcting for age at death, sex, cortical AD pathology, antemortem cognitive status, and presence of vascular and genetic risk factors.

RESULTS:

LC hypopigmentation was associated with a higher odds of overall CAA in the NACC dataset, leptomeningeal CAA in the ROSMAP dataset, and arteriolosclerosis in both datasets.

DISCUSSION:

LC pathology is associated with cerebral microangiopathy, independent of cortical AD pathology. LC degeneration could potentially contribute to the pathways relating vascular pathology to AD. Future studies of the LC-norepinephrine system on cerebrovascular health are warranted.

pmcBackground

The locus coeruleus (LC) forms the main source of norepinephrine (NE) production in the brain and contributes to a wide range of higher cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, arousal, and long-term memory consolidation and retrieval 1–4. The LC is involved early in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 5–7. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in LC neurons could be one of the first neuropathological changes in AD, preceding the classical AD hallmarks of neocortical accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles 6, 8, 9. Neuropathological work using unbiased stereology demonstrated that starting from Braak stage 0, the average LC volume shrinks by 8.4% with each Braak stage, and neuronal loss becomes evident after Braak stage III 10, 11. Furthermore, several autopsy and MR-imaging studies demonstrated strong associations between LC integrity and cognition in the context of underlying AD pathology 12–15. Because of its apparent clinical importance and early involvement in AD, the LC has received considerable attention as a potential biomarker and target for early disease-modifying interventions 14, 16.

The LC is located close to the fourth ventricle in the pontine tegmentum and innervates the entire central nervous system, but with limited projections to the striatum 17, 18. Many LC neurons are rich in neuromelanin pigment, a by-product of NE synthesis, which gives the LC its characteristic color and name (i.e., blue spot). Besides its neuromodulatory effects, the LC-NE system also highly innervates the cerebrovasculature, mainly through axonal varicosities which provide bulk NE release to reach intracortical penetrating arterioles and capillaries 19. Through its binding to various adrenergic receptors, NE largely acts as a vasoconstrictor and is involved in the regulation of cerebral blood flow and neurovascular coupling, but also plays an important role in the maintenance of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity 20–23. Interestingly, animal studies suggest that damage to the long LC axonal projections to the cortex can cause structural and functional BBB damage, and also endothelial damage, vascular remodeling, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) 24, 25. In addition, recent human post-mortem work discovered that arteriolosclerosis in the brainstem was associated with increased tau deposition in LC neurons 26. Together, these studies suggest that LC pathology in AD might be associated with cerebral microangiopathy.

Many studies have established a mechanistic link between cerebral microangiopathy and AD pathology, and vascular alterations have been postulated to be involved early in the AD disease process, though the exact pathways underlying this association are an active area of research27–29. Based on the available above-mentioned evidence, it can be hypothesized that degeneration of the LC-NE system could be an important contributor in explaining the relationship between AD and cerebral microangiopathy. So far, the association between LC degeneration and cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) in the context of neurodegenerative disease has received very little attention. We aimed to address this knowledge gap by associating LC degeneration to cerebral microangiopathy in two large human autopsy cohorts including individuals who were cognitively normal and cognitively impaired at time of death. We first explored associations between LC hypopigmentation (as a proxy for LC degeneration) and CAA and arteriolosclerosis (as measures of cerebral microangiopathy) while correcting for classical AD pathology in the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset 30. Subsequently, we aimed to validate our results in a second independent dataset from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) 31. Investigating the link between LC pathology and cSVD could have important implications for future prevention trials targeting the LC-NE system.

Methods

NACC dataset

Data was obtained from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) database (http://alz.washington.edu/), which combines data from NIA-funded Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) in the United States. The ADRCs contribute clinical, cognitive, and diagnostic data from participants who were evaluated longitudinally since September 2005 in the Uniform Data Set (UDS). A subset of UDS participants underwent genetic and/or neuropathological examination. The UDS and Neuropathology data set have been described in detail previously30, 32. Informed consent was obtained from all NACC participants or informants, and the study was approved by the local institutional review boards at each institution. This analysis included data from 2197 participants from 31 ADRCs for whom data was entered into the UDS form from 2005 through February 2020, and for whom the rating of LC hypopigmentation was available within the v10 neuropathology form. We selected all participants with a diagnosis of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD dementia at their last clinical visit before autopsy, or who had AD pathology at autopsy (defined as Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) score of intermediate or high according to the NIA-AA recommendations 33). The median time interval between the last visit and death was 11 months (interquartile range, 6 to 28). The dataset included 309 persons with a diagnosis of normal cognition, 203 persons with mild cognitive impairment, and 1665 persons with dementia. In addition, 20 individuals who were cognitively impaired but who did not fulfill the criteria for MCI were included, all of whom had intermediate or high ADNC scores at autopsy.

ROSMAP dataset

Data was obtained from two ongoing longitudinal clinical-pathological studies, including the Religious Orders Study (ROS) which started in 1994, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) which started in 1997 31, 34, 35. The ROS includes older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers aged 65 years and older from across the United States. The MAP includes persons aged 65 and older from continuous care retirement communities and senior subsidized housing facilities around the Chicago metropolitan area. Participants were eligible to participate in each study if they did not have a known diagnosis of dementia and agreed to annual detailed clinical evaluation and donation of brain, spinal cord, and muscle after death. The studies were both approved by an Institutional Review Board of the Rush University Medical Center. Both informed consent and a repository consent, as well as an Anatomic Gift Act were obtained from each participant. These analyses included data from 1637 participants for whom data was included in the ROSMAP dataset through February 2021 and for whom neuropathologic assessment, including LC hypopigmentation, was available. Clinical evaluation was performed each year by a clinician (neurologist, geriatrician, or geriatric nurse practitioner). At the time of death, a final clinical diagnosis was established by a neurologist who was blinded to neuropathology data based on all available clinical data. All participants had a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI) (n=533), MCI (n=386), or AD dementia (n=718).

Neuropathological measures

NACC

Neuropathological evaluations were conducted by individual ADRCs, using similar but nonidentical diagnostic approaches as outlined in the NACC Neuropathology Data Set Form 30. CAA, arteriolosclerosis, and LC hypopigmentation were graded semi-quantitatively (none, mild, moderate, severe). Thal phase for amyloid-β plaques (A score), Braak stage for neurofibrillary degeneration (B score)) and density of neocortical neuritic plaques (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) score) (C score) were assessed, and AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) was determined according to the NIA-AA recommendations.33 Presence of TDP-43 pathology was defined as presence of phosphorylated TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions extending beyond the amygdala versus absence of TDP-43 pathology or TDP-43 pathology in amygdala only 36. Presence of Lewy body pathology was dichotomized as absent or present (any brain region).

ROSMAP

The ROS and MAP studies share a common core of neuropathological data. CAA pathology was evaluated in four neocortical regions: midfrontal, mid-temporal, parietal, and calcarine cortices. Paraffin-embedded sections were immunostained for amyloid-β using monoclonal anti-human antibodies (4G8, 1:9000, Covance Labs, Madison, WI; or 6F/3D, 1:50, Dako North America Inc, Carpinteria, CA; or 10D5, 1:600; Elan Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA). For each tissue block, meningeal and parenchymal vessels were assessed for amyloid-β deposition and scored from 0 to 4 (0=no deposition; 1=scattered segmental but no circumferential deposition; 2=circumferential deposition up to 10 vessels; 3=circumferential deposition up to 75% of the region; 4=circumferential deposition over 75% of the total region). Overall CAA score for each region was the maximum of the meningeal and parenchymal CAA scores. Scores were averaged across regions and summarized as a continuous measure of CAA pathology. For the semiquantitative summary, CAA scores were classified into a 4-level severity rating using cutoffs determined by a neuropathologist (none, average across regions=0; mild, average across regions&lt;1.5; moderate, average across regions 1.5 to 2.5; severe, average across regions&gt;2.5) 37. Arteriolosclerosis was defined as histological evidence including intimal deterioration, smooth muscle degeneration, and fibrohyalinotic thickening of arterioles with consequent narrowing of the vascular lumen. The vessels of the anterior basal ganglia were evaluated with a semiquantitative grading system from 0 (none) to 7 (occluded). These levels were recoded into a semi-quantitative score (none, mild, moderate, severe) 38. LC hypopigmentation was rated macroscopically and semi-quantitatively as present, possible, or not present. Based on the CERAD semiquantitative measure of neuritic plaques and Braak stage, a neuropathologic AD diagnosis was made by NIA-Reagan (no AD, possible AD, probable AD, definite AD) 11, 39–41. Bielschowsky silver stain was used to assess Braak stage for neurofibrillary degeneration 11, 39. TDP-43 pathology was assessed on paraffin-embedded brain tissue sections with immunohistochemistry in 8 brain regions (amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus CA1, hippocampus dentate gyrus, anterior temporal pole cortex, midtemporal cortex, orbital frontal cortex, midfrontal cortex) using phosphorylated monoclonal TAR5P-1D3 (pS409/410; 1:100, Ascenion, Munich, Germany or MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) TDP-43 antibody. Presence of TDP-43 pathology was dichotomized as 0 (no TDP-43 pathology or TDP-43 pathology in amygdala only) or 1 (TDP-43 pathology extending beyond amygdala) 36. Lewy body pathology was assessed on paraffin-embedded brain tissue sections from midfrontal, midtemporal, inferior parietal, anterior cingulate, entorhinal cortices, amygdala, and midbrain with immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein (1:50; Zymed). The presence of Lewy body disease was assessed using modified McKeith criteria 42. Here, we dichotomized presence of Lewy body pathology as not present versus present (nigral-predominant, limbic-type, or neocortical-type) 43.

In a subset of 160 MAP participants, LC neuronal density and tangle density (per square millimeter) were evaluated using immunohistochemistry with a monoclonal anti-human tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) antibody (1:750, Immunostar, Hudson, WI) and an hyperphosphorylated tau antibody (clone AT8, 1:2000, Thermo-Scientific, Rockford, IL), respectively, each bilaterally at two levels of the LC (rostral and main body) 13, 44. Transverse blocks of fixed tissue were taken at the rostral levels of the LC and the body of the LC. Tissue blocks were embedded in paraffin and 6μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to survey the region of interest. TH-stained sections were used to outline the LC region of interest with Stereo Investigator Program software (MBF Biosciences, Williston, VT) attached to an Olympus BX60 microscope with a motorized stage. Sections missing more than 50% of the LC were excluded. Neuronal density was measured bilaterally at both levels of the LC, and immunostained neurons having nuclei were counted at a magnification of 400x. All neurons counted were divided by the area of the region to obtain the neuron density/μm2 (figure 1). LC tangle density was assessed using computer-assisted sampling 45.

Genetic and vascular risk factors

NACC

APOE genotyping was performed either independently by the ADRC, the Alzheimer’s Genetics Consortium, or the National Centralized Repository for AD. History of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus (absent or present, any type) was clinician-reported.

ROSMAP

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood or frozen post-mortem brain tissue, and genotyping was performed at Polymorphic DNA Technologies (Alameda, CA) by investigators blinded to all clinical and pathologic data 46. History of hypertension was documented based on self-reports. History of hypercholesterolemia was defined as total cholesterol level in blood samples of 240mg/dL or higher at any study visit. Total cholesterol level was measured with a lipid panel performed by Quest Diagnostics. History of diabetes mellitus was documented based on self-reports or the use of diabetes medication by the participant.

Statistical analyses

All analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 3.6.3.), all tests were two-tailed, and α&lt;0.05 was applied 47. LC hypopigmentation was dichotomized as present (moderate or severe in the NACC dataset; maybe or present in the ROSMAP dataset) vs absent (none or mild in the NACC dataset; absent in the ROSMAP dataset). CAA severity and arteriolosclerosis were dichotomized as present (mild, moderate, or severe in both the NACC and ROSMAP datasets) or absent (none in both the NACC and ROSMAP datasets). Leptomeningeal and cortical CAA were dichotomized as present (sum score of four tissue blocks &gt; 0) or absent (sum score of four tissue blocks = 0) in the ROSMAP dataset. Group differences were assessed with student’s t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or Pearson’s Chi-squared tests where appropriate.

First, we assessed the association between LC hypopigmentation and presence of CAA and arteriolosclerosis in the NACC dataset. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) for logistic regression were used with presence of LC hypopigmentation as independent variable, and presence of CAA or arteriolosclerosis as dependent variable. Analyses were corrected for age at death, sex, severity of amyloid-β pathology (Thal stage), Braak stage, clinical diagnosis (dichotomized as cognitive impairment vs. NCI), and presence of vascular (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus) or genetic (presence of at least one APOE ε4 allele vs no ε4 allele) risk factors. Cases with missing data on any of the variables of interest or covariates were excluded. Because of relatively high numbers of missing data in the vascular risk factor variables, the analyses were repeated without the vascular risk factors as covariates. Post-hoc, we added presence of TDP-43 pathology or presence of Lewy body pathology as covariates to the models to evaluate the potential influence of these comorbid pathologies on the main results. We assumed a logit link function for binary outcome with an exchangeable correlation structure to account for within-center correlation, using the package “gee”.

Next, we performed similar analyses in the ROSMAP dataset. Binary logistic regression models were used with presence of LC hypopigmentation as independent variable, and presence of CAA or arteriolosclerosis as dependent variable. Analyses were corrected for age at death, sex, severity of AD neuritic plaque pathology, Braak stage, clinical diagnosis (dichotomized as cognitive impairment vs. NCI), and presence of vascular (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus) or genetic (presence of at least one APOE ε4 allele vs no ε4 allele) risk factors. Because Thal stage was not available in the ROSMAP dataset, we used the CERAD score as a measure of AD neuritic plaque pathology. In addition, we corrected for study (ROS vs MAP) to account for potential study-related differences. Cases with missing data on any of the variables of interest or covariates were excluded. The analyses were again repeated without the vascular risk factors as covariates due to high numbers of missing data for the variable hypercholesterolemia. Post-hoc, we added presence of TDP-43 pathology or presence of Lewy body pathology as covariates to the models to evaluate the potential influence of these comorbid pathologies on the main results. In addition, we repeated our analysis on the association of LC hypopigmentation and presence of CAA within each brain region separately (i.e., presence of CAA in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe) to assess for potential differences between anatomical locations. We applied a general linear model with binomial distribution and logit link using the package “stats”. Post-hoc, we repeated the analysis with leptomeningeal and cortical CAA as dependent variable separately.

Finally, we assessed whether local histologic measures of LC integrity, including neuronal density and tangle density, were associated with CAA and arteriolosclerosis presence in a subset of the MAP study. Binary logistic regression models were used with LC neuronal density or LC tangle density as independent variable, and CAA or arteriolosclerosis presence as dependent variable. Analyses were corrected for age at death, sex, severity of AD neuritic plaque pathology (CERAD score), Braak stage, clinical diagnosis, presence of vascular risk factors, and APOE genotype. Post-hoc, we added presence of TDP-43 pathology or Lewy body pathology to the model to assess their potential contribution, and we repeated our analysis for presence of CAA within each brain region separately (i.e., presence of CAA in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobe) to assess for potential differences between anatomical locations. Cases with missing data on any of the variables of interest or covariates were excluded. We applied a general linear model with binomial distribution and logit link using the package “stats”.

Results

Locus coeruleus hypopigmentation and cerebral microangiopathy in the NACC dataset

The NACC dataset included 2197 persons, including 1263 individuals without LC hypopigmentation (57%) and 934 (43%) with LC hypopigmentation. Table 1 shows the group characteristics of persons with and without LC hypopigmentation. Persons with LC hypopigmentation were significantly younger at the time of death (median 79 vs 87 years, p&lt;0.001), less likely to be female (46% vs 53%, p&lt;0.001), more likely to have a higher Braak and Thal stage (both p&lt;0.001), more likely to have TDP-43 pathology (33% vs 26%, p=0.012) and Lewy body pathology (52% vs 24%, p&lt;0.001), less likely to have a history of hypertension (43% vs 60%, p&lt;0.001) and diabetes mellitus (9% vs 15%, p=0.002), and more likely to have at least one APOE ε4 allele (57% vs 41%, p&lt;0.001), impaired cognition (95% vs 79%, p&lt;0.001), CAA (79% vs 60%, p&lt;0.001), and arteriolosclerosis (89% vs 79%, p&lt;0.001) compared to persons without LC hypopigmentation. No group differences were found for the presence of hypercholesterolemia.

In univariable analyses, persons with CAA were more likely to have LC hypopigmentation compared to persons without CAA (50% vs 27%, χ2=96.366, p&lt;0.001), and persons with arteriolosclerosis were more likely to have LC hypopigmentation compared to persons without arteriolosclerosis (44% vs 27%, χ2=37.064, p&lt;0.001) (figure 2A).

GEE parameter estimates of the multivariable logistic regression models predicting presence of CAA or arteriolosclerosis are displayed in table 2. LC hypopigmentation was associated with higher odds of both CAA (B (SE) = 0.426 (0.170); OR [95% CI] = 1.531 [1.098; 2.134]) and arteriolosclerosis (B (SE) = 0.348 (0.177); OR [95% CI] = 1.416 [1.001; 2.002]). This result did not change when we repeated the analyses without correcting for vascular risk factors (supplemental table 1) or when we added presence of Lewy body pathology to the model (supplemental table 1b). When we added presence of TDP-43 pathology to the model the sample size was reduced by approximately 50% due to missing data, and the association between LC hypopigmentation and both CAA and arteriolosclerosis was no longer statistically significant (supplemental table 1a).

Locus coeruleus hypopigmentation and cerebral microangiopathy in the ROSMAP dataset

The ROSMAP dataset included 1637 persons, including 971 individuals without LC hypopigmentation (59%) and 666 individuals with LC hypopigmentation (41%). Persons with LC hypopigmentation had a significantly higher Braak stage (p&lt;0.001) and were more likely to have TDP-43 pathology (39% vs 31%, p&lt;0.001), Lewy body pathology (34% vs 16%, p&lt;0.001), at least one APOE ε4 allele (29% vs 23%, p=0.006), impaired cognition (73% vs 64%, p&lt;0.001), and arteriolosclerosis (72% vs 61%, p&lt;0.001), compared to persons without LC hypopigmentation (table 1). No group differences were found for age at death, sex, CERAD score, the presence of vascular risk factors, or the presence of CAA.

In univariable analyses there was no difference in the likelihood of having LC hypopigmentation between persons with and without CAA (42% vs 38%, χ2=1.482, p=0.224). Persons with arteriolosclerosis were more likely to have LC hypopigmentation compared to persons without arteriolosclerosis (45% vs 33%, χ2=23.106, p&lt;0.001) (figure 2B).

Parameter estimates of the multivariable models predicting presence of CAA or arteriolosclerosis are displayed in table 3. LC hypopigmentation was associated with a higher odds of arteriolosclerosis (B (SE) = 0.392 (0.137); OR [95% CI] = 1.481 [1.134; 1.939]) but not of CAA (B (SE) = 0.196 (0.167); OR [95% CI] = 1.217 [0.876; 1.695]). This result did not change when we repeated the analyses without correcting for vascular risk factors (supplemental table 2) or when adding presence of TDP-43 pathology (supplemental table 2a) or Lewy body pathology (supplemental table 2b) to the model. When we repeated the analysis for presence of CAA in each brain region separately (i.e, frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) the results did not change (results not shown).

Post-hoc, we repeated the analyses for leptomeningeal and cortical CAA separately as dependent variables. In univariable analyses, persons with cortical CAA were more likely to have LC hypopigmentation compared to persons without cortical CAA (43% vs 38%, χ2=3.908, p=0.048). A trend was present for persons with leptomeningeal CAA being more likely to have LC hypopigmentation compared to persons without leptomeningeal CAA (44% vs 37%) (χ2=3.806, p=0.051). Parameter estimates of the multivariable models predicting presence of leptomeningeal and cortical CAA are displayed in supplemental table 3. LC hypopigmentation was significantly associated with presence of leptomeningeal CAA (B (SE) = 0.443 (0.194); OR [95% CI] = 1.557 [1.068; 2.285]) but not with cortical CAA (B (SE) = 0.128 (0.142); OR [95% CI] = 1.137 [0.861; 1.502]).

Local measures of LC integrity and cerebral microangiopathy in the MAP dataset

In 160 MAP participants data was available on local histological measures of LC integrity, including 66 persons with normal cognition (41%), 53 persons with mild cognitive impairment (33%), and 41 persons with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dementia (26%) at the time of death. Summary characteristics are shown in supplemental table 4. In univariable analyses, no differences in LC tangle or neuronal density were found between cases with and without cerebral microangiopathy, although a trend for higher tangle density was present in persons with arteriolosclerosis compared with persons without arteriolosclerosis (U=1930, p=0.054) (figure 3). In multivariable analyses, LC tangle density was associated with greater odds of presence of arteriolosclerosis (B (SE) = 0.549 (0.186); OR [95% CI] = 1.731 [1.250; 2.591]) (table 4). No significant associations were found between LC neuronal density and arteriolosclerosis, or between LC tangle or neuronal density and CAA (supplemental tables 5 and 6). The results did not change when adding presence of TDP-43 pathology or Lewy body pathology to the model, or when repeating the analysis for CAA presence in each region (i.e., frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital) separately (results not shown).

Discussion

Exploring associations between LC neuropathology and cerebral microangiopathy could lead to new insights into potential causes and/or consequences of degeneration of the LC-NE system, which is important considering the promising therapeutic value of the LC for AD, and the involvement of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology. In the present study, we discovered a consistent association between LC hypopigmentation and the presence of arteriolosclerosis across the large NACC neuropathology dataset, and the ROSMAP cohort studies. The presence of LC hypopigmentation was associated with a 42-48% greater odds (based on tables 2 and 3) of having arteriolosclerosis, independent of AD-pathology, clinical diagnosis, APOE ε4 carriership or vascular risk factors. In addition, higher LC tangle density, but not neuronal density, was associated with the presence of arteriolosclerosis in a subset of persons from MAP. We also found an independent association between LC hypopigmentation and likelihood of presence of CAA in the NACC dataset, and a positive association between LC hypopigmentation and leptomeningeal CAA in ROSMAP.

Our findings are consistent with one recent human post-mortem study that demonstrated a positive association between pontine arteriolosclerosis severity and tau pathology in the LC 26. This finding suggests that arteriolosclerosis might be linked to AD in an early disease phase, as pretangles in the LC precede local neurodegeneration 10, 14. In contrast to earlier work we did not find a relationship between arteriolosclerosis and LC neuron number 26. However, it should be noted that in the present work LC neurons were defined through TH-staining (and not neuromelanin-positivity), while in the earlier study both TH-positive and/or neuromelanin-positive LC neurons were counted. One possibility is that the association between arteriolosclerosis and LC pathology is specific to neuromelanin-bearing neurons, which is in line with our study finding an association between LC hypopigmentation and arteriolosclerosis 48. Neuromelanin slowly accumulates in the LC with age and plays a controversial neuroprotective role 49, 50. On the one hand, neuromelanin chelates heavy metals, thereby diminishing their toxic effects on neurons. On the other hand, with increasing age, accumulation of heavy metals in neurons can result in a neurodegenerative response in which heavy metals are released into the extracellular space, inducing a cascade of neuroinflammation and further neurodegeneration16, 49. Intriguingly, it has been hypothesized that LC neurons are particularly sensitive to volume loss caused by the uptake of toxic compounds from the cerebrovasculature, because of the extensive exposure of the LC axons to the circulatory system 51. Especially in the context of BBB leakage, which is both a feature of cSVD and AD 52–54, axonal uptake of toxic blood constituents at the level of the cortex, including heavy metals, could contribute to LC neurodegeneration, which could in turn further exacerbate BBB disruption, inducing a vicious cycle.

In the NACC dataset LC hypopigmentation was associated with the presence of CAA, and in ROSMAP we found a significant association between LC hypopigmentation and leptomeningeal CAA, but not cortical CAA. Since the LC-NE system innervates the cortical arterioles and capillaries, and not the leptomeningeal vessels, the latter finding was unexpected 21, 55. A potential explanation could be that the leptomeningeal vessels are the first to be affected in CAA, and downstream deposition of amyloid-β in the vascular wall could be the result of impaired clearance of amyloid-β by cortical vessels 56. Interestingly, previous work has suggested that NE might play a significant role in regulating brain clearance 57, and this finding is in line with a more recent animal study showing that damage to the LC-NE system triggered the development of CAA pathology 24. Another potential explanation for the lack of a robust association between overall CAA and LC hypopigmentation in our analyses is the difference in distribution of APOE ε4 carriership between both cohorts.

The addition of TDP-43 as covariate in the analyses in the NACC datase made the significant associations between LC hypopigmentation and both CAA and arteriolosclerosis disappear. However, it should be noted that the sample size in these post-hoc analyses was approximately half of the original sample size (n~400 vs n~800) because of many cases with missing data on TDP-43 pathology. Moreover, presence of TDP-43 pathology was not a significant predictor in these models. Therefore, we suspect that the disappearance of the significant association between LC hypopigmentation and cerebral microangiopathy in the models with TDP-43 pathology is related to the large reduction in statistical power. The addition of TDP-43 pathology to our analyses in the ROSMAP dataset did not impact the results (fewer data on TDP-43 presence were missing in this cohort), nor did the addition of Lewy body pathology to the models in both cohorts.

Our findings raise the possibility that strategies aimed at LC neuroprotection may have beneficial effects on cerebrovascular health, or conversely, that targeting microvascular health might be a way to preserve LC neuronal integrity. In the same line of thought, an older animal study has shown that LC innervation of cortical vessels is important for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity in the context of hypertension 58, and accumulating evidence suggests that management of vascular risk factors indeed forms a successful strategy to lower the risk of AD type dementia 59. Future studies are needed to provide further insights into the interplay between degeneration of the LC-NE system and cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology. Until recently, LC integrity could only be studied ex vivo due to a lack of in vivo assessment methods, but over the past years the development of novel in vivo MRI techniques for the measurement of LC integrity has opened up new opportunities to study LC degeneration in AD in vivo 14, 60–62. Longitudinal tracking of LC integrity and MRI markers of cSVD and BBB leakage could lead to important insights into the directionality of the relationship between LC degeneration and cerebral microangiopathy, as can experimental animal studies. Establising the directionality of this relationship is an important step to consider before clinical intervention studies can be initiated. Furthermore, investigating LC integrity in patient groups with CAA and arteriolosclerosis could lead to new insights into the role of LC degeneration in these conditions. In addition, pure forms of cSVD, such as hereditary Dutch-type CAA and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoaraiosis (CADASIL), could be studied to explore associations between LC integrity and cSVD in the absence of significant AD pathology 63, 64

A major strength of the present study is the use of two independent large human neuropathology datasets, which allowed us to, at least in part, replicate the results that we initially found in the NACC dataset in a second independent dataset from the ROSMAP cohort studies. Furthermore, we were able to assess different postmortem measures of LC integrity (i.e., LC hypopigmentation, LC tangle density, and LC neuronal density) in ROSMAP, providing a more in-depth view of our analyses. Further, ROSMAP enjoys very high follow-up and autopsy rates minimizing bias due to loss to follow-up or autopsy. However, this study also has limitations. The NACC dataset is not a population-based study, and therefore subject to enrollment bias. Further, NACC has low follow-up and autopsy rates. While the ROSMAP is community-based rather than clinic based, this dataset is also not entirely representative of the general population because dementia was an exclusion criterion at enrollment, and survival-bias might have played a role because only individuals &gt;65 years were included. Further subtle bias may have been introduced by the requirement of agreement to organ donation. In the NACC dataset, nonuniform data collection could potentially lead to bias 30. We attempted to account for within-center correlations by applying GEE models in our statistical analyses. It should be noted that in the ROSMAP study arteriolosclerosis was measured in the basal ganglia, an area which has more limited LC-NE projections 17. Nonetheless, we suspect that presence of arteriolosclerosis in the basal ganglia is representative for overall arteriolosclerosis burden in the rest of the brain. In addition, the middle and rostral regions of the LC, which project to the cortex, are generally more vulnerable to AD-related degeneration compared with the caudal part of the LC, which projects to the cerebellum and spinal cord 65. While the assessment of tangle density and neuronal density in the MAP subset of the ROSMAP study was performed in the middle and rostral LC regions, the location of the LC section along the rostral-caudal axis for hypopigmentation ratings was unknown in both cohorts. Future studies should explore regional associations between LC degeneration along the rostral-caudal axis and cerebral microangiopathy. Another limitation of the study which could have led to bias is missing data, but upon repeating our main analyses excluding variables with many missing values, the results did not change. Finally, the semi-quantitative nature of the assessment of the histopathological measures is a limitation in this study. Assessment of LC neurodegeneration and severity of cerebral microangiopathy on a continuous/quantitative instead of semi-quantitative scale and a more extensive regional assessment linked to the LC projection areas are important considerations for future studies.

Conclusion

In conclusion, LC degeneration measures were consistently associated with the presence of arteriolosclerosis in two large neuropathology cohorts, independent of other potential contributors, including cortical AD pathology, clinical diagnosis and vascular risk factors. Furthermore, LC hypopigmentation was related to the presence of CAA in both datasets, though these results were less consistent. Our findings suggest that targeting the LC may have beneficial microvascular effects, and conversely, that protection of the cerebrovasculature may form a promising strategy to protect the LC.

Research in context

Systematic review: The authors reviewed the literature using traditional (e.g., PubMed) sources. While the literature on the association between LC pathology and microvascular pathology is limited, we found a few preclinical studies suggesting that LC degeneration and microvascular pathology are closely related. These relevant citations are appropriately cited.

Interpretation: Our findings demonstrate that LC pathology is associated with cerebral microangiopathy, independent of cortical AD pathology.

Future directions: Further insights into the interplay between degeneration of the LC-norepinephrine system and cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD pathophysiology are needed. The development of novel in vivo MRI techniques for the measurement of LC integrity has opened up new opportunities to study LC degeneration in AD in vivo. Longitudinal tracking of LC integrity and MRI markers of cSVD and BBB leakage could lead to important insights into the directionality of the relationship between LC degeneration and cerebral microangiopathy.

Highlights

We associated LC pathology and cerebral microangiopathy in 2 large autopsy datasets

LC hypopigmentation was consistently related to arteriolosclerosis in both datasets

LC hypopigmentation was related to CAA presence in the NACC dataset

LC hypopigmentation was related to leptomeningeal CAA in the ROSMAP dataset

LC degeneration may play a role in the pathways relating vascular pathology to AD
