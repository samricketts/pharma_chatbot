Tau, a microtubule-associated protein promotes assembly and stability of microtubules which is related to axoplasmic flow and critical neuronal activities upon physiological conditions. Under neurodegenerative condition such as in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), tau-microtubule binding dynamics and equilibrium are severely affected due to its aberrant post-translational modifications including acetylation and hyperphosphorylation. This event results in its conformational changes to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) after aggregation in the cytosol. The formation of NFT is more strongly correlated with cognitive decline than the distribution of senile plaque, which is formed by polymorphous beta-amyloid (Ax) protein deposits, another pathological hallmark of AD. In neurodegenerative conditions, other than AD, the disease manifestation is correlated with mutations of the MAPT gene. In Primary age-related tauopathy (PART), which is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals, tau deposition is directly correlated with cognitive deficits even in the absence of Aβ deposition. Thus, tauopathy has been considered as an essential hallmark in neurodegeneration and normal brain aging. In this review, we highlighted the recent progress about the tauopathies in the light of its posttranslational modifications and its implication in AD and the aged brain.


Introduction:

The Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for more than 50–60% of all the dementia cases and 50% of all individuals of 85 years and above, dies due to the AD (Qiu, Kivipelto et al. 2009, Bekris, Yu et al. 2010, Vinters 2015, Graham, Bonito-Oliva et al. 2017). The two well established diagnostic hallmarks of the AD are extracellular Aβ senile plaque deposition and intracellular Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation (Jellinger and Attems 2007, Vinters 2015, Graham, Bonito-Oliva et al. 2017). The overproduction of Aβ peptide from a transmembrane protein Amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential action of beta and gamma-secretase eventually leads to the formation of Aβ plaques. On the other hand, hyperphosphorylation of a microtubule-associated protein Tau on its serine or threonine residues enhances its intracellular deposition that ultimately leads to form Neurofibrillary Tangle (NFT) (Lee, Balin et al. 1991, Goedert, Spillantini, et al. 1992, Vinters 2015, Graham, Bonito-Oliva, et al. 2017). The aberrant hyperphosphorylation of tau disrupts its binding ability to microtubule (MT) thereby affecting MT stability and axoplasmic transports (Petrucelli, Dickson et al. 2004, Kosik and Shimura 2005, Poppek, Keck et al. 2006, Dickey, Kamal et al. 2007, Green, Steffan et al. 2008) (Bramblett, Goedert et al. 1993, Iqbal, Zaidi et al. 1994, Stoothoff and Johnson 2005). Tau-related pathology or tauopathy is not only involved in AD (Mattson 2004, Goedert and Spillantini 2006, Ballatore, Lee, et al. 2007, Spires-Jones, Stoothoff, et al. 2009), but also found to be an integrated part of several neurodegenerative conditions such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), Pick’s disease, dementia pugilistica, frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) (Spillantini and Goedert 2013) as well as of primary age-related tauopathy in normal aging process (Crary, Trojanowski et al. 2014).

The cognitive impairment was found to be the most common outcome of AD patients, and severity of cognitive impairment have been found to be more strongly correlated with the NFT deposition compare to that of the Aβ load in AD brain (Arriagada, Growdon, et al. 1992, Bierer, Hof, et al. 1995). Consistent with this finding, it was shown that Aβ directly triggers tau protein phosphorylation and aggregation; if once NFT is formed, Aβ clearance cannot improve the cognitive decline (Oddo, Billings, et al. 2004); however, the removal of tau can improve the cognitive function even after Aβ burden remains to be constant or increased (Chesser, Pritchard, et al. 2013, Simic, Babic Leko, et al. 2016, Wang, Jin et al. 2018, Xin, Tan et al. 2018). Thus, Tau aggregation is considered as the more critical causal mediator of cognitive dysfunction over Aβ.

Aging is considered the most critical risk factor for almost all neurodegenerative diseases. An increasing number of studies suggest that the underlying cause and symptoms of healthy aging and age-related disorders are overlapping in various cases. Albeit many investigations have identified the underlying molecular mechanisms, but these do not suffice to combat the neurodegenerative diseases due to its multifactorial complex and progressive nature. In this review, we will focus on how tauopathy both in the degenerative and aging process takes a vital role to play in the progression of neurological abnormalities. Also, we will emphasize the importance of two prominent posttranslational modifications of tau such as phosphorylation, and acetylation that significantly contribute to the disease progression.

The potential role of Aβ in hyperphosphorylation of tau, tauopathy and associated cognitive dysfunction:

Two groundbreaking studies in 2001 had given convincing evidence that Aβ burden in AD brain directly instigates tau aggregation by enhancing its phosphorylation (Gotz, Chen et al. 2001, Lewis, Dickson, et al. 2001). It was further confirmed in a study where Aβ infusion to P301L tau transgenic mice, which carries a transgene encoding human tau with four microtubule-binding repeat domains, triggers NFT formation (Gotz, Chen, et al. 2001). As a part of the mechanism it was shown that Aβ oligomers could induce phosphorylation of tau by mostly activating the cJun kinase or AKT- GSK3beta signaling pathway (Ma, Yang, et al. 2009, Tokutake, Kasuga, et al. 2012, Li, Braunstein, et al. 2016). The recent investigation further strengthened the fact that neuritic amyloid plaques trigger the pathological conversion of tau in an AD mouse model (Li, Braunstein, et al. 2016). Consistent with these studies another group has documented that tau aggregation and subsequent neurofibrillary degeneration was shown to be increased in JNPL3/Tg2576 double transgenic mice without an increase in Aβ load (Lewis, Dickson, et al. 2001). Supporting the in vivo finding; it was shown that tau phosphorylation at ser-202 and ser-396/ser-404 residues in rat hippocampal and human cortical neurons induced by Aβ fibrils, remains as either soluble or amorphous-aggregated form. (Busciglio, Lorenzo, et al. 1995). Hyperphosphorylation of tau ultimately leads to its aggregation, mislocalization, and accumulation instead of its proteasomal degradation that leads to neurofibrillary degeneration (Blurton-Jones and Laferla 2006) (Qiu, Kivipelto, et al. 2009, Bekris, Yu et al. 2010, Vinters 2015, Graham, Bonito-Oliva, et al. 2017).

For decades, the neurotoxic effects of Aβ and tau had been established separately until recently it has been found that in many cases Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive deficit are primarily mediated by tau protein (Mucke and Selkoe 2012) (Huber, Yee, et al. 2018), and Aβ-induced cytotoxicity is absent in tau null background (Rapoport, Dawson et al. 2002, Nussbaum, Schilling et al. 2012). Similarly, another independent study has shown that early intervention of Aβ accumulation can prevent pTau development via the proteasomal degradation machinery (Oddo, Billings et al. 2004, Iaccarino, Singer, et al. 2016). Consistent with this finding, another study shows that gamma frequency entrainment can lower initial load of Aβ and modified microglial population through the reduction of Tau phosphorylation in mice model of tauopathy where tau P301S mutant form of human microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) was overexpressed constitutively (Iaccarino, Singer et al. 2016). Therefore, it can be convincingly concluded that tau aggregation could be independent of Aβ load; however, a question remains unanswered whether tau phosphorylation is enough to induce cognitive dysfunction independent of Aβ.

A substantial number of efforts have been made to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for how tau phosphorylation contributes to cognitive dysfunctions. One of the remarkable studies has shown that tau can mediate the Aβ-induced learning and memory deficits by inducing an imbalance in the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory neurons in the brain by modulating a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Fyn kinase (Roberson, Scearce-Levie, et al. 2007, Roberson, Halabisky, et al. 2011). This notion was further confirmed by the fact that depletion of tau can prevent the synergistic effect of Aβ and Fyn on synaptic, network and cognitive impairment (Roberson, Scearce-Levie et al. 2007, Roberson, Halabisky, et al. 2011). Recently an elegant study provides a direct mechanism how phosphorylated, and mislocalized tau can induce synaptic dysfunction which underlies impairment of cognitive function. Synaptic strength depends primarily on NMDA receptor activation which is known to regulate by PSD95-Fyn-NMDA receptor complex at the postsynaptic site (Chabrier, Blurton-Jones, et al. 2012). PSD95, a membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK), is the major scaffolding protein in the excitatory postsynaptic density (PSD) and a potent regulator of synaptic strength, while Fyn physically associates with Tau, and can phosphorylate tyrosine residues near the amino terminus(Lee, Newman, et al. 1998, Lee, Thangavel et al. 2004) (Chabrier, Blurton-Jones et al. 2012). Tau can be hyperphosphorylated upon NMDA receptor activation through a signaling cascade that is also activated by Afi. Thus, it can be anticipated that hyperphosphorylation of tau will affect the complex formation among PSD95-Fyn-NMDA receptor complex at the postsynaptic site that will, in turn, attenuate synaptic functions. Therefore, Fyn has been linking the two critical pathologies in AD uniquely and merit it to be considered as an attractive target for AD therapeutics. However, Fyn is a challenging target, with broad expression throughout the body and significant homology with other members of the Src family kinases, which may lead to unintended off-target effects. A phase 2a proof-of-concept clinical trial in patients with AD is currently underway, providing critical first data on the potential effectiveness of targeting Fyn in AD (Nygaard, van Dyck, et al. 2014, Nygaard 2018).

Other studies have shown that Aβ can induce cognitive dysfunction by impairing axonal transport (Vossel, Zhang, et al. 2010), dendritic function (Ittner, Ke et al. 2010) and long-term potentiation (Roberson, Halabisky et al. 2011, Shipton, Leitz et al. 2011), which are independent of the activity of Fyn kinase but dependent on Tau. Targeting tau either by chemical treatment or immunotherapy have been shown to improve cognitive function even though the Aβ levels continue to increase suggests that Tau can directly regulate cognitive dysfunction (Castillo-Carranza, Guerrero-Munoz, et al. 2015) with the severity of AD. It was shown that tau immunotherapy could reduce Aβ burden to facilitate cognitive function (Castillo-Carranza, Guerrero-Munoz, et al. 2015); further reemphasizes the fact that tau phosphorylation is much more relevant for cognitive dysfunction compared to an increase in Aβ levels.

Molecular mechanisms underlying post-translational modifications of tau and their correlations to tauopathy:

Tau undergoes a myriad of various posttranslational modifications, such as acetylation (Cohen, Guo et al. 2011), nitration (Horiguchi, Uryu et al. 2003), glycation (Ledesma, Bonay et al. 1995), O-glycosylation (Arnold, Johnson et al. 1996), ubiquitination (Cripps, Thomas et al. 2006), SUMOylation (Dorval and Fraser 2006), cross-linking by transglutaminase (Wilhelmus, Grunberg et al. 2009), isomerization (Miyasaka, Watanabe et al. 2005), conformational alteration and proteolytic cleavage (Gamblin, Chen et al. 2003) in addition to phosphorylation. Although, the exact function for all these post-translational modifications of tau during neurodegeneration has not been fully understood; it was found that modulating these post-translational modifications of tau affect the phosphorylation level of tau and tauopathy. In fact, most of the post-translational modifications of tau functions as the precursors of tau phosphorylation and modulation of their levels can impact the tauopathy. Therefore, these posttranslational modifications of tau offered an attractive target to reduce tauopathy other than either eliminating the phosphorylation or inducing the dephosphorylation of tau. Among these modifications, acetylation of Tau has been found to be most clinically relevant and shown to have significant influence on phosphorylation level of tau (Alonso, Zaidi et al. 1994, Alonso, Grundke-Iqbal et al. 1996, Wang, Grundke-Iqbal et al. 1996, Alonso, Grundke-Iqbal et al. 1997, Alonso, Zaidi et al. 2001, Wang, Grundke-Iqbal et al. 2007). Therefore, in this review, we will mostly highlight the current literature regarding the phosphorylation and acetylation of tau in tauopathy with the progression of AD.

Phosphorylation of Tau in AD:

Under physiological condition, tau can be phosphorylated in both in WT and hAPP transgenic mice on 63 sites in both the cases (Morris, Knudsen, et al. 2015). However, the AD brain contains 2–3 fold higher hyperphosphorylated tau (6–8 mol P/mole of tau protein) compared to that of a healthy brain(2–3 mol P/ mole of tau protein) (Kopke, Tung, et al. 1993). The mass spectrometry analysis revealed that there are at least 40 serine/threonine and two tyrosine sites for phosphorylation in PHF form of tau (Hasegawa, Morishima-Kawashima, et al. 1992, Morishima-Kawashima, Hasegawa, et al. 1995, Hanger, Betts, et al. 1998).

Further studies revealed that hyperphosphorylation of tau is the net effect of the interplay between several kinases and phosphatases. Tau is phosphorylated mainly by several prolines directed protein kinases (PDPKs) mostly on serine/threonine residues followed by a proline residue. Important tau PDPKs are glycogen synthase kinase-3beta(GSK-3beta), Cyclin-dependent like kinase-5(CDK5) and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) (Arioka, Tsukamoto et al. 1993, Morishima-Kawashima, Hasegawa, et al. 1995, Woods, Cohen et al. 2001, Liu, Liang et al. 2008). Apart from the PDPKs, several non-PDPKs like calcium/calmodulin-activated protein kinase II (CaMK II), microtubule affinity regulated kinase 110 (MARK p110), protein kinase A (PKA) and casein kinase 1 (CK1) can also phosphorylate tau (Baudier and Cole 1988, Ledesma, Correas et al. 1992, Singh, Grundke-Iqbal, et al. 1996, Singh, Zaidi, et al. 1996, Drewes, Ebneth, et al. 1997, Sironi, Yen, et al. 1998). The dephosphorylation of tau is mainly regulated by PP2A that accounts for ~70% of total tau phosphatase activity in the central nervous system (Bennecib, Gong, et al. 2000, Gong, Lidsky, et al. 2000, Liu, Grundke-Iqbal, et al. 2005).

Tau acetylation in AD

Acetylation of tau recently has got special attention as a potent regulatory post-translational modification which is implicated in several tauopathies including AD pathology (Min, Cho et al. 2010, Cohen, Guo et al. 2011, Cook, Stankowski et al. 2014, Min, Chen et al. 2015, Hettinger and Cirrito 2016). An NMR analysis using recombinant hTau has shown that each molecule of tau can be acetylated on an average six lysine residues (Kamah, Huvent, et al. 2014). Particular interest in tau acetylation is lying in the fact that, acetylation of tau can trigger tau aggregation through its hyperphosphorylation as it has been found in AD, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy and in tau transgenic mice models of tauopathies (Cohen, Guo et al. 2011, Irwin, Cohen et al. 2012). This study indicates the pivotal upstream regulation of tau acetylation over tau hyperphosphorylation. Thus, in that case, targeting acetylation despite phosphorylation of tau might be a more effective strategy to combat the disease root-cause and outcome.

First identification of tau acetylation and its implication with neurodegeneration came in 2010 by Li Gan and his group (Min, Cho et al. 2010). They have found multiple tau acetylation sites including three putative lysines 163,174 and 180 residues which prevent tau ubiquitination and therefore tau turn over. In this study, authors have drawn clear evidence of lysine acetyltransferase, p300 mediated tau acetylation promotes phospho-tau aggregation, and this can be blocked by deacetylation of tau by SIRT1 deacetylase (Min, Cho et al. 2010). In the subsequent year, Cohen et al. further confirmed that Lysine 280 acetylation in the MT-binding domain of tau causes impairment in tau-MT affinity and aggregation of the gain of function tau toxic species (Cohen, Guo, et al. 2011). The particular importance of acetylation of Lysine 280 residue in critical events in tauopathy was further strengthened (Irwin, Cohen, et al. 2012). Li Gan and his group further identified another novel acetylation site, Lysine 174 which is also acetylated by p300 and acetylation on Lysine174 is a potent tau modification that leads to its aggregation and cognitive deficits (Min, Chen et al. 2015). Through a recent study by Tracy et, al, they have demonstrated for the first time that acetylated tau is linked with synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline through postsynaptic KIBRA signaling pathway, actin signaling, and AMPA receptor trafficking. They have created acetylated mimic tau by mutating K274 and K281 sites with glutamine which showed a higher level of misfolded tau aggregation along with long-term hippocampal potentiation (Tracy, Sohn, et al. 2016).

Moreover, it has been well demonstrated that overexpression of mutant tau at lysine 280 that mimics acetylated tau in a Drosophila transgenic species augments the phosphorylation at S262 and T212/S214 of tau (Gorsky, Burnouf et al. 2016). Interestingly tau has been found to have intrinsic acetyltransferase activity as well. It can be autoacetylated through cysteine residues at C291 and C322 position (Cohen, Friedmann, et al. 2013). However, what exactly causes tau autoacetylation remains to be elusive. Most of the putative lysine residues for acetylation in the microtubule-binding domain can also be ubiquitinated implying that acetylation prevents the ubiquitination and thus proteasomal degradation and clearance of tau in pathological conditions (Min, Cho et al. 2010, Morris, Knudsen, et al. 2015).

The extent of acetylation of tau has been found to be modified by several acetyltransferases and deacetylases in AD condition. Previously it mentioned that p300 or CBP acetyltransferases could acetylate tau and deacetylated by SIRT1 (Min, Cho et al. 2010). In contrast, a negative correlation between SIRT1 and Tau has also been identified. In this study, it was shown that pseudo acetylation on tau prevents the phosphorylation level of tau and can mitigate Aβ-mediated toxicity (Gorsky, Burnouf, et al. 2017).

However, a missing mechanistic link between Aβ to acetylated tau in AD condition demands further investigation. In this context, very recently we reported a novel upstream mechanism that regulates tau acetylation status upon exposure to Aβ which straightforwardly connects Aβ with tau acetylation (Sen, Saha, et al. 2018). Nitrosative stress has previously been implicated in the synaptic loss, neuron death in neurodegenerative conditions including AD (Nakamura and Lipton 2009, Gu, Nakamura et al. 2010, Nakamura and Lipton 2013) where nitrosylation of proteins takes place (Sen and Snyder 2010). In this literature, we reported that Aβ-induced NO production nitrosylate GAPDH which in turn promote the acetylation and activation of p300 acetyltransferase which further acetylates tau protein (Sen, Saha, et al. 2018) (Figure 1). Also, nitrosylated GAPDH inactivated the deacetylase, SIRT1 by nitrosylation enhancing the possibility of more tau acetylation. So, our study presents the nitrosylated GAPDH as a double-edged sword and a very potent regulator of tau acetylation upon Aβ induction.

Oxidative stress and Tauopathy:

An increase in oxidative stress is a characteristic feature of AD. Recent studies have substantiated that tauopathies have been associated with oxidative stress markers and neuronal damage both in vitro and in vivo. Intracellular ROS is mainly produced in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), peroxisomes and endoplasmic reticulum (Abou-Sleiman, Muqit, et al. 2006). ROS attacks the cellular macromolecules like DNA, RNA, membrane lipids and proteins. Oxidative stress markers are closely associated with Aβ deposition in AD brain, Pick’s disease as well as corticobasal degeneration (CBD) patients (Castellani, Smith, et al. 1995). In other tauopathies, such as Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorder and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), several lipid peroxidation markers, namely, malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were generated due to ROS (Odetti, Garibaldi et al. 2000, Cantuti-Castelvetri, Keller-McGandy et al. 2002, Martinez, Carmona et al. 2008). Other studies have shown that fatty acid oxidation product also can induce the NFT formation in AD condition (Patil and Chan 2005).

The direct evidence of oxidative stress and impairment of tau function was shown in a study where overexpression of wild-type tau in N2a neuroblastoma cells confers greater susceptibility to oxidative stress and manifests the toxicity through impairment of microtubule-associated peroxisome transportation (Stamer, Vogel, et al. 2002). These studies raised the possibility that oxidative stress may have a direct influence on Tauopathies. Indeed, it was demonstrated that the oxidative damage induced tau phosphorylation which leads to its aggregation (Ledesma, Bonay, et al. 1994, Yan, Chen, et al. 1994, Perez, Cuadros, et al. 2000, Reynolds, Lukas, et al. 2006). In a chronic oxidative stress model where M17 neuroblastoma cells were treated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), resulted in an increase in the level of phosphorylated tau in concomitant with an inhibition of glutathione synthesis (Su, Wang, et al. 2010). Further studies revealed that ROS induced by 1,2-diacetyl benzene (DAB; a neurotoxic metabolite of 1,2-diethyl benzene) cause hyperphosphorylation of tau by activating GSK-3β in the hippocampus that leads to impaired memory in mice (Lovell, Xiong et al. 2004). In another study, where Tau was overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, tau was shown to be phosphorylated at ser396, ser404, and Thr231 residues after induction of oxidative stress by treatment with H2O2 (Chiara, Gambalunga, et al. 2012). Consistent with this finding, a recent study demonstrates that sodium orthovanadate, which is commonly used to induce oxidative stress, causes an augmentation in hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser396 significantly; however, it was decreased upon resveratrol treatment in rat hippocampal slices (Jhang, Park, et al. 2017). Resveratrol is known to function as an activator of a protein deacetylase SIRT1(Borra, Smith et al. 2005, Mohar and Malik 2012), which can reduce the oxidative stress by promoting the level of antioxidants through activation of several transcription factors such as Foxo3a (Giannakou and Partridge 2004, Daitoku, Sakamaki et al. 2011). Considering that GSK-3β or JNK/p38kinse are major kinases to phosphorylate Tau, it was shown that inhibiting GSK-3β or JNK/p38kinse can improve streptozotocin-induced oxidative stress and cognitive impairment by reducing tau phosphorylation and tauopathy (Guo, Sun, et al. 2017).

Furthermore, oxidative stress has been found to be a critical regulator in tau-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila where ROS is the vital element that causes tau phosphorylation through p38-MAPK pathway activation (Dias-Santagata, Fulga, et al. 2007). Apart from the activation of kinases responsible for tau phosphorylation induced by oxidative stress, there are several pieces of evidence where the level of a dephosphorylating enzyme of tau, such as PP2A activity was decreased upon the oxidatively stressed condition (Zhang, Yang, et al. 2014). This data suggests that oxidative stress triggers tau hyperphosphorylation both by activating kinases and deactivating phosphatases with the severity of AD.

Since tau acetylation is upstream of tau phosphorylation; it opens an excellent scope of investigation on whether oxidative stress can directly modulate tau acetylation or not. In this respect we would like to hypothesize that oxidative stress might have some direct effect on p300/CBP acetyltransferase mediated tau acetylation because elsewhere it has been reported that p300/CBP interacts and acetylates its various substrates in the presence of ROS (Dansen, Smits, et al. 2009, Sun, Chin, et al. 2009, Jain, Wei, et al. 2012). Oxidative stress has been shown to affect the deacetylating activity of SIRT1(Salminen, Kaarniranta, et al. 2013), which is critical for the regulation of tau acetylation and subsequent tau phosphorylation. Thus, it might also be worth investigating whether oxidative stress induced SIRT1 inactivation has any direct role on tau acetylation and therefore abnormal aggregation.

Tauopathies in neurodegenerative disorders other than AD: a perspective from genetic manipulation:

Implications of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases other than AD has started to explore in late 1980, and the first evidence was observed in the study reported by Dr. Pollock and his associates. In this study, it was shown that filamentous aggregates in Tau are common in Pick’s disease which is under the group of disorders known as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (Pollock, Mirra, et al. 1986). Further characterization of these diseases it was revealed that tau was hyperphosphorylated without any significant pathology of either Aβ and α-synuclein. The subsequent molecular, biochemical studies provide insight into the tau hyperphosphorylation, and it was shown that all six tau isoforms were present in sarkosyl extracts in equal ratios of R3 and R4 isoforms which were composed of typical tau triplets of 60, 64 and 69 kDa, and additional minor bands of 72/74 kDa. Eventually, this characteristic pattern of tau phosphorylation was evidenced in frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Niemann-Pick disease type C, Down syndrome and dementia pugilistica (Sergeant, Delacourte et al. 2005). In other neurodegenerative disorders, such as PSP (Flament, Delacourte et al. 1991), corticobasal degeneration (CBD; (Ksiezak-Reding, Morgan et al. 1994), argyrophilic grain disease (AgD; (Simic 2002)), and some cases of FTDP-17, sarkosyl extracts revealed that tau protein was separated as doublets of 64 and 69 kDa, which is a typical feature of class II tauopathies where isoforms with 4R predominates. On the other hand, the Pick’s disease is characterized by the presence of pathological tau doublets of 60 and 64 kDa and contain mainly 3R tau isoforms (class III tauopathy) whereas in myotonic dystrophy type I (DM1) or Steinert’s disease a major insoluble tau band of 60 kDa, and minor 64 and 69 kDa bands have been identified (Delacourte, Robitaille et al. 1996, Buee, Bussiere et al. 2000, Jovanov-Milosevic, Petrovic et al. 2012, Jadhav, Cubinkova et al. 2015). Despite having all the characterization of Tau, the direct relevance of tau dysfunction and filament formation in these diseases has not been shown yet.

Further genetic studies shed some light into this relevancy, and it was reported that autosomal dominantly inherited form of FTD with parkinsonism and amyotrophy (disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex, DDPAC) is in the same chromosome 17q21.2 region where MAPT gene is present(Wilhelmsen, Lynch et al. 1994). Consistent with this finding, another group has shown that the genetic defect in MSTD (multiple system tauopathy with presenile dementia) mapped to chromosome 17q21–22 (Murrell, Koller, et al. 1997), where MAPT gene is present. MSTD is characterized by the presence of 4R tau and solubility of tau was dependent on its isoforms. More specifically, it was shown that increased splicing of exon 10 of the MAPT gene might be the cause of familial MSTD (Foster, Wilhelmsen, et al. 1997). Sequencing results found that conversion of a guanine (G) to adenine (A) transition at position +3 of the intron following exon 10 is critical to segregate the disease (Spillantini, Murrell et al. 1998). However, tauopathy is not dependent only one mutations; other independent studies have shown that two exonic mutations (P301L and V337M) (Poorkaj, Bird, et al. 1998), or missense mutations (G272V, P301L, and R406W) in exon 10 significantly contributes to the tauopathy (Hutton, Lendon, et al. 1998). Reversing these mutations was able to reduce the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly (Hasegawa, Smith, et al. 1998, Hong, Zhukareva, et al. 1998); suggesting that these mutations directly contribute to the tauopathy. Considering that these mutations in the MAPT gene can significantly contribute to the tauopathy independent of Aβ changes; these mutations can be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases other than AD.

Tauopathy in healthy brain aging:

Tau deposition is also typical in the aged brain, specifically, in primary age-related tauopathy (PART) (Bouras, Hof et al. 1993, Ikeda, Kondo et al. 1993, Bancher and Jellinger 1994, Itoh, Yamada et al. 1996, Jellinger and Attems 2007, Crary, Trojanowski et al. 2014). Clinically, PART can be either correlated or associated with other neurodegenerative conditions such as tangle predominant senile dementia (TPSD), tangle only dementia, preferential development of NFT without senile plaques, or senile dementia of the neurofibrillary tangle type (SD-NFT) (Crary, Trojanowski et al. 2014). Even though PART is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals and universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, the diagnosis of PART in the aged patient remains challenging. However, identifying the association between tauopathy with PART opens the possibility of using tau imaging as a diagnostic tool to detect PART in the clinical settings.

Several efforts have been made to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism to establish a correlation between common aging mechanisms with tau deposition. Among them, an alteration in the kinase activity of Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has been shown to have a significant effect on aging. Because, the reduced signaling of mTOR kinase and inhibition by rapamycin have been demonstrated to extend the lifespan of yeast, worms, and flies (Schieke and Finkel 2006, Harrison, Strong, et al. 2009, Bishop, Lu et al. 2010). As a part of the mechanism, it was shown that inhibition of mTOR leads to an increase in autophagy which can reduce protein aggregation and tauopathies in neurodegenerative condition (Ravikumar, Vacher, et al. 2004, Bishop, Lu et al. 2010). Secondly, in the healthy aging brain, impairment of proteasomal degradation machinery leads to unwanted protein aggregates, and this phenomenon also gives a link between aging process with tau accumulation (Fischer, van Dijk, et al. 2009). Thirdly, aging leads to either downregulate or inactivates a protein deacetylase, SIRT1, which is essential to reduce oxidative stress and maintain the level of neurotrophic factors such as BDNF to keep the brain healthy (Rogina and Helfand 2004, Boily, Seifert et al. 2008, Mair and Dillin 2008). In AD, an inactivation of SIRT1 results in an induction of acetylation of Tau which serves as a precursor for tau phosphorylation and tauopathy. Thus, we cannot rule the possibility that inactivation of SIRT1 in the aged brain, specifically in PART, will result in an increase in acetylation of Tau and pathology associated with Tau.

Conclusion

Although substantial progress has been made to understand the pathological aspects of tau phosphorylation in several preclinical models of neurodegenerative disorders, targeting tau phosphorylation to improve cognitive deficiencies remains abortive. Thus, identification of novel post-translational modification of Tau such as tau acetylation which occurs well ahead of tau phosphorylation provides a unique opportunity to address the tau phosphorylation. Specifically, tau acetylation at K280 has the most promising target to treat the tauopathy because of its direct correlation with tau phosphorylation. However, it is not clear whether tau acetylation can directly affect oxidative stress or neuroinflammation independent of tau phosphorylation. Also, reducing tau acetylation is clinically challenging because Tau acetylation depends on activation and inactivation of an acetyltransferase p300 and a protein deacetylase SIRT1. Both proteins have several substrates other than Tau, and these substrates are functionally relevant to numerous physiological aspects in a cell. Thus, attenuating their activities may result in adverse effects instead of providing neuroprotection. Therefore, it would be much more meaningful to attenuate the aberrant activation of p300 and SIRT1. Our recent study offers an insight where nitrosylation of GAPDH has been shown to be responsible for both aberrant activation of p300 and inactivation of SIRT1. Also, blocking GAPDH-nitrosylation using Omigapil, which is being tested for patients of muscular dystrophy have shown promising results to prevent tau acetylation. In the future, much more studies are needed to specifically target the Tau acetylation which contributes to the pathology upon activation of neurological disorders including AD or the aged brain.

Figure 1: Upon induction of amyloid beta, Nitrosylated GAPDH activates an acetyltransferase p300 via direct interaction. On the other hand, it inactivates a deacetylase, SIRT1 by nitrosylates SIRT1 through transnitrosylation reaction. As a result, the level of Tau acetylation remains elevated and accumulation of acetylated tau leads to tau phosphorylation and NFT in AD.

Highlights:

Accumulation of amyloid beta is a potential driver of tauopathy.

Other Post-translation modification of Tau such as acetylation regulates tauopathy.

Oxidative stress and tauopathy are functioning through feed forward loop.

Tauopathy in the aged brain is functionally different than AD brain.
