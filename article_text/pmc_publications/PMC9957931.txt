Background:

Injuries are a leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits among older adults, and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) may be at particular risk. We compared injury-related ED use among assisted living (AL) residents with and without ADRD and assessed differences in the risk of injury-related ED visits among individuals with ADRD residing in ALs with memory care designation vs. general AL.

Methods:

Using Medicare claims, we identified a cohort of fee-for-service beneficiaries who lived in AL in 2018 and resided in one of 20 states with site-specific information on memory care designation (n=116,754). Outcomes included all injury-related ED visits and injury-related ED visits resulting in hospitalization in calendar year 2018. We fit multilevel models of the association between ADRD and outcomes, adjusting for resident demographic characteristics and chronic conditions, license type characteristics, and AL characteristics, with random intercepts at the AL and license type levels. Among residents with ADRD, we examined whether memory care licensure was associated with injury-related ED visits.

Results:

The adjusted risk of injury-related ED use during the year was 20.1% (95% CI: 19.6%, 20.6%) for residents with ADRD compared to 16.1% for residents without ADRD (95% CI: 15.7%, 16.5%; p&lt;0.001). The adjusted risk of injury-related ED use ending in hospitalization was 4.9% (95% CI: 4.6%, 5.1%) for AL residents with ADRD and 3.9% for residents without ADRD (95% CI: 3.8%, 4.1%; p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences in injury-related ED visits between residents with ADRD in ALs with memory care designation and residents in general AL.

Conclusions:

Injury-related ED visits are common among AL residents with ADRD and residents in memory care, but residents in memory care AL experienced similar risks of injury as those in general AL. Further research should identify modifiable factors that can prevent injury among AL residents with ADRD.

pmcIntroduction

Injuries are a leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits among older adults.1 Although most injuries are related to falls, older adults also experience injuries from medication errors, accidents, and abuse.2 Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are prone to sensory overload and are at risk of delirium in the hospital.3,4 Research in nursing homes and the community demonstrates that individuals with ADRD have a higher risk of injury than individuals without ADRD.2,5,6 Systematic investigation is needed to understand whether ADRD is associated with injury-related ED visits in assisted living (AL), where over one-third of residents have ADRD.7 ALs are staffed 24 hours daily and provide meals but do not provide around-the-clock nursing care like a nursing home. ALs have homelike features and are regulated by states rather than the federal government.8 Understanding injury risk for individuals with ADRD in AL can help inform safe models for care in this understudied setting that constitutes over half of all long-term care beds.8

Further, while memory care AL is associated with lower risk of long-term nursing home admission and hospitalization,9 research has not examined whether memory care is protective against injuries, which is important to understand given that memory care AL costs 29% more on average than general AL.10 Regulations for memory care ALs vary by state; however, many contain provisions regarding training and building design,11 which are features associated with reduced falls among nursing home residents.13 This study examined the association between ADRD and injury-related ED visits among AL residents and whether injury-related ED visits differed among residents with ADRD who lived in ALs with vs. without memory care licensure.

Methods

Data

Using an established methodology, we identified a sample of Medicare beneficiaries residing in ALs with 25+ beds in Medicare enrollment data by their 9-digit ZIP codes.14 AL ZIP codes and bed size came from a national registry of ALs collected from state licensing agencies. Data on resident demographic characteristics came from the Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File (MBSF); the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) segment contained beneficiaries’ chronic conditions. We used the inpatient Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files and the outpatient Medicare claims to obtain ED visits. AL license type characteristics included state regulations and whether the AL was licensed to provide memory care. The Residential History File provided information regarding hospital and nursing home stays using a combination of nursing home Minimum Data Set assessments, Medicare claims, and the OASIS data15; we used this file to exclude individuals who were in another health setting on December 31st of 2017.

Sample Selection

We created a sample of individuals who resided in 25+ bed ALs within the United States on December 31st, 2017. Minnesota and Connecticut license agencies rather than physical locations; therefore, we excluded residents from these states. We excluded beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage in 2017 or 2018, whose chronic condition and claims data are incomplete and residents in ALs with less than 10 people in them whom we could identify using Medicare claims. In our sub-analysis, we limited to residents with ADRD in 20 states that had a memory care designation or certification, and for which we were able to obtain information on which ALs had those designations in 2018 (see Table S1).

Measures

We identified individuals with ADRD using the CCW flag. This flag identifies, within a 3 year lookback period, individuals who had at least one home health, inpatient, outpatient, carrier or skilled nursing facility claim with one of 22 ICD-10 codes pertaining to dementia.16,17 Memory care is defined as an AL with a state license, certification, or designation to provide care for residents with ADRD.9 We classified whether an ED visit represented an injury using the New York University algorithm18,19 (please see the supplementary material, most frequent injuries are in Supplementary Table S2).We classified injuries into 2 separate outcomes: the first was any injury-related ED use regardless of whether it ended in a hospitalization within the calendar year 2018. The second was any injury-related hospitalization within the calendar year 2018. ALs have varying thresholds for ED transfer following a resident injury.20 Therefore, we examined both outcomes to explore whether the relationships were robust when only considering the most severe injuries (i.e., those that resulted in a hospitalization). ED stays that ended in observation stays were categorized as any injury-related ED use. If the observation stay ended in a hospital admission, it was also included in the injury-related hospitalization category.

We adjusted for chronic conditions associated with injurious falls, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, coronary disease (acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, or ischemic heart disease), stroke, and osteoporosis.21,22 We also incorporated a count of 18 chronic conditions used to measure multimorbidity among Medicare beneficiaries (see footnote in Table 1).23 Models were also adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, Hispanic, and other), and dual-enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid. At the AL level, we adjusted for the percent of residents with ADRD and AL bed size. The specificity of regulations pertaining to direct care staff is associated with reduced risk of hospitalization.24 We used a dataset of regulations for each type of licensed setting that was constructed using the LexisNexis legal database (350 license types in total).12We categorized the regulations on a scale of 0 being the least specific (no requirements) and 3 being the most specific (requirements for a specific number or ratio of staff) (See Table S3 for examples).24

Analysis

We described the characteristics of AL residents who had injury-related ED utilization during the year, comparing residents with and without ADRD. Using multilevel linear probability models, we examined the relationship between ADRD and injury-related ED use, adjusting for AL and resident characteristics. Random intercepts were included at the license type and AL levels. We used estimates from the linear probability models to make two predicted probabilities for each person, based on their health status and other attributes: one prediction assigning their exposure to 0 (i.e., no ADRD diagnosis) and a second prediction assigning it to 1 (i.e., ADRD diagnosis). The predicted values were averaged across all of the AL residents in each exposure category to yield two mean predicted ED risks. Estimates represent the risk-adjusted risks of ED visits for exposed and unexposed that take into account differences between groups in comorbidities and demographics. We calculated standard errors of the estimates using the delta method. We then examined the relationship between memory care licensure and injury-related ED use among the subset of AL residents with ADRD, adjusting for the same covariates as the first model. As sensitivity analyses, we analyzed mixed effects negative binomial models with random intercepts at the license type and AL levels, using the number of injury-related ED visits during the year as outcome measures and adjusting for the same covariates. Data analysis was conducted using STATA 17. Additional information about the data and methods used for these analyses can be found in the Brown Digital Repository (https://doi.org/10.26300/mk49-z508)

Results

Our final sample included 116,754 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who resided in 3,165 ALs in 2018, 29% of whom had ADRD (Table 1). Of residents in memory care, 31% had ADRD. 33,811 AL residents with ADRD were included in the subanalysis. Residents with ADRD were older on average than residents without ADRD and were more likely to be diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, coronary disease, and other chronic conditions.

Figure 1 shows the adjusted predictive margins of the relationship between ADRD and injury-related ED use within the year. The adjusted risk of injury-related ED use was 20.1% (95% CI: 19.6%, 20.6%) for AL residents with ADRD compared to 16.1% for residents without ADRD (95% CI: 15.7%, 16.5% ; p&lt;0.001). This translates to a 24.8% higher relative risk of injury-related ED use for residents with ADRD compared to residents without ADRD. The adjusted risk of injury-related ED use that ended in a hospitalization was 4.9% (95% CI: 4.6%, 5.1%) for AL residents with ADRD and 3.9%(95% CI: 3.8%, 4.1%) for AL residents without ADRD (p&lt;0.001), representing a 25.6% higher risk (See Supplementary Table S4). Residents with ADRD also experienced a higher adjusted number of injuries (Table S5).

In Figure 2, we display the adjusted predictive margins of the relationship between memory care licensure and injury-related ED use within the year. There was not a statistically significant relationship between memory care licensure and injury-related ED utilization. Among residents with ADRD, those living in memory care-licensed ALs had an adjusted risk of injury-related ED use of 22.7%, compared with 22.8% for residents in AL without memory care (p=0.68). Adjusted rates of injury-related ED visits resulting in hospitalization also did not differ significantly between residents with ADRD living in AL with memory care (5.8%) vs. without memory care (5.7%), p=0.801 Table S6).The adjusted number of injuries did not vary between memory care and non-memory care ALs (Table S7).

Discussion

Our study found that AL residents with ADRD experienced a 24.8% higher risk of injury-related ED use when compared to residents without ADRD. Individuals with ADRD experience reduced strength and impaired balance, which can increase the risk of falls; they also experience changes in behavior (e.g., wandering).25 Individuals with ADRD are also more likely to be victims of abuse and resident-to-resident aggression.26

Transfer protocols of ALs and states may play a role in the high risk of injury-related ED use observed in our study. Although 20.1% of residents with ADRD experienced an injury-related ED visit during the year, only 4.9% were subsequently admitted to inpatient care. Some ALs have policies that necessitate the transfer of residents to EDs after any injury despite its severity;20 this may be related to a lack of RNs who are qualified to perform an assessment to determine whether a transfer to the ED is necessary.27 RN staffing is associated with reduced hospitalizations in nursing homes.28 Arkansas requires that an AL transfer to an “appropriate medical facility” after an illness or accident.”29 Transfer protocols may be especially salient for residents with ADRD, who may have an impaired ability to communicate about their health after an injury.30

We did not find a statistically significant relationship between memory care licensure and injury-related ED utilization. Because we were not able to observe the progression of ADRD or severity of symptoms, we cannot rule out that residents in memory care may be more prone to falls, but higher staff levels or training may offset the risks. States vary in the number and specificity of their regulations for memory care ALs,11 which may contribute to our null findings.

Our study has limitations. We used the CCW flag to identify individuals with ADRD, which likely resulted in some false-positive and false negative classifications of dementia in our sample.17 The CCW also does not have a measure of dementia severity. We included ALs with 25+ beds where we had information about memory care licensure. Our results may not be generalizable to smaller ALs or ALs in other states. In some states, a memory care designation may apply to a unit or a wing within an AL; only 5 states in our study required the whole building to be licensed for memory care.12 We likely included some residents with ADRD who resided in a portion of the AL that was not licensed as memory care; this underidentification would bias our findings toward the null. We did not include Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, who may have systematically different risks of injury-related ED use compared to traditional Medicare beneficiaries. Finally, our study was descriptive. Future research can explore various factors such as medication use, staffing rates, and hospice utilization that may influence differential risk of injuries or transfer decisions among AL residents with ADRD.

Conclusions

This study found that AL residents with ADRD were particularly vulnerable to injury-related ED visits, regardless of whether they resided in memory care or general AL. More information is needed about regulations and practices in AL that can reduce the risk of injury.
