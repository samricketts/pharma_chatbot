Objective:

To assess the effects of the common functional polymorphisms Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) val66met and Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) val158met on the cognitive, neuropsychiatric, motor symptoms, and MRI findings in participants with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) syndromes.

Methods:

The Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) val66met and the Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) val158met polymorphisms were genotyped in 174 participants with FTLD syndromes including frontotemporal dementia (FTD), primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Grey matter volumes, the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Wechsler Memory Scale, and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were compared between allele groups.

Results:

The BDNF met allele at position 66 was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms [F(1, 136)=9.50, p=0.002]. The COMT val allele at position 158 was associated with impairment of executive function [F(1, 76)=6.14, p=0.015] and decreased bilateral volume of the head of the caudate among FTLD patients (uncorrected voxel-level threshold of p &lt; 0.001). Neither polymorphism had a significant effect on motor function.

Conclusions:

These findings suggest that common functional polymorphisms likely contribute to the phenotypic variability seen in patients with FTLD syndromes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to implicate BDNF polymorphisms in depressive symptoms in FTLD. Our results also support an association between COMT polymorphisms and degeneration patterns and cognition in FTLD.

Introduction

A range of phenotypes from behavior and language symptoms to motor neuron disease can be observed in patients with Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), even across patients with the same pathogenic mutation {1}. There is accumulating evidence that functional polymorphisms, including in Transmembrane protein 106b (TMEM106B) {2}, Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) {3}, and the dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) {4}, effect phenotype in FTLD-spectrum disorders. In this study, we assess the effects of common functional polymorphisms in two genes, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), on clinical and MRI findings in patients with FTD and CBS.

BDNF is a member of the “neurotrophin” family of neuron growth factors {5}. BDNF contains a functional polymorphism (rs6265) that results in a valine vs. methionine at codon 66, termed the val66met polymorphism. The met allele is associated with decreased BDNF activity {6}. BDNF is involved in hippocampus-mediated learning and long term potentiation (LTP) {7–10}. BDNF appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease (HD) {11}, Major Depressive Disorder {12, 13}, and the recovery of executive function after brain injury {14}. BDNF genotype appears to affect the volume of several brain regions in healthy subjects including the hippocampus, lateral temporal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and cingulate {15, 16}.

COMT regulates dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by converting released dopamine to 3-methoxytyramine {17–19}. COMT has a common functional methionine (met) for valine (val) substitution at codon 158, referred to as the val158met polymorphism (rs4680). The enzyme in individuals with the met/met genotype has three to four times lower activity than that in individuals with the val/val genotype {20}. Thus, individuals with the met allele have greater amounts of available dopamine. Individuals with the met allele demonstrate superior performance on tests of frontal cognitive function in an allele dose-dependent fashion {21–29}. COMT genotype appears to affect the symptom presentation of Alzheimer’s disease {30}, schizophrenia {26, 31, 32}, ADHD {33}, and brain injury {34}. COMT genotype has also been shown to affect grey matter volume in dopamine (DA) -innervated brain regions in patients with dementia, including FTLD-spectrum illnesses {3}. Studies show that functional polymorphisms in the DRD4 gene that reduce DA tone are associated with greater degeneration of brain regions with high DA receptor density, and increased apathy in FTD patients, {4} suggesting that changes in DA may impact both neurodegeneration and symptoms in FTLD syndromes.

In the current study, we assess the effects of the BDNF val66met and the COMT val158met polymorphisms on cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor symptoms and regional brain volumes on MRI in 174 patients with FTLD-spectrum illness. Based on prior findings in healthy controls and in patients with dementia, we hypothesized that the BDNF met allele would be associated with memory dysfunction and that the COMT val allele would be associated with executive and motor dysfunction.

Materials &amp; Methods

Patients

174 patients were genotyped: 82 with behavioral variant Frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 19 with nonfluent variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (nfvPPA), 4 with semantic variant PPA (svPPA), 5 with Frontotemporal dementia – Motor neuron disease (FTD-MND), and 64 with Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS). Subjects were seen as part of an ongoing research study on FTLD-spectrum illnesses in the Cognitive Neuroscience Section of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the NIH, Bethesda, MD. They were either self-referred or referred by outside clinicians. Patients arrived at the NIH with a caregiver and were diagnosed by an evaluation by a neurologist (E.M.W.), psychiatrist (E.D.H), and neuropsychologist (J.G.) by standard clinical criteria {35–37}. The subjects also met updated criteria for probable bvFTD {38}. The updated terminology is used in this report. The subjects and caregivers spent 9 days participating in extensive neuropsychological and imaging studies. Approximately 6% of our patient cohort had an autosomal dominant mutation know to result in FTD including mutations in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72 {39}. The remainder of our patients had sporadic illness. While most of the patients have not yet come to autopsy, those CBS patients that have demonstrated roughly equal AD (7 patients) and CBD (8 patients) pathological diagnoses

We required all subjects to have an assigned research durable power of attorney prior to admission to the protocol and the assigned individuals gave written informed consent for the study. The patients gave assent for the study. All aspects of the study and the consent procedure were approved by the NINDS Institutional Review Board. Demographic and clinical data on the patients is presented in Table 1.

Genotyping

Peripheral blood samples were collected from patients in 5 ml EDTA tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood as recommended by the manufacturer (Wizard kit, Promega). After quality assessment and quantification using NanoDrop ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA), 10 ng of DNA samples were genotyped in 5 μl TaqMan genotyping assay as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and probes for SNPs rs4680 in COMT gene and rs6265 in BDNF gene were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The assays were run on an ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The genotyping results were analyzed using the SDS software version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems). For quality control, 10% were repeated for the genotyping assay, and the results were 100% concordant.

Cognitive, behavioral, and motor analyses

We assessed a broad range of cognition, including all of the neuropsychological tests examined in {40}: The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) {41}, The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS-2) {42}, and the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III) {43}. We assessed neuropsychiatric symptoms with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) {44}. The same subtests were analyzed in the present study as in {40}. In pilot testing, many of our patients had trouble understanding some of the more difficult D-KEFS tests and so of the nine D-KEFS tests, only five were administered and analyzed: Trail Making, Verbal Fluency, Sorting, Twenty Questions, and the Tower test. All primary scaled measures of the D-KEFS tests (excluding measures that are derived from primary measures) were used in the factor analysis. The sample size and ratio of subjects to variables satisfies guidelines for principle components analysis {45}. To assess motor function, we analyzed the mean number of taps on the Finger Tapping Test {46} and number of pegs placed on the Grooved Pegboard Test for dominant and non-dominant hands and the Composite Standard Score on the Test of Oral and Limb Apraxia (TOLA) {47}.

Statistics:

To explore the relationship between allele dosage and symptoms, we used an ANOVA to compare the scores on our cognitive and behavioral symptoms between our subjects with and without a BDNF met or COMT val allele dosage. For primary analyses to test our hypotheses that COMT val alleles would be associated with worsened executive and motor function and BDNF met alleles would be associated with worsened memory, composite scores for memory, executive and motor function were compared followed by subsequent test of the subtests that comprised the composite score If the ANOVA for the composite measure was not significant when corrected for multiple comparisons of the composite measures, we did not continue to subtest analyses. The composite scores were calculated as follows: the mean of the D-KEFS factor scores (executive), the mean of the WMS-III standardized scores (memory), and the mean of z-scores of the Finger Tapping, Grooved Pegboard, and TOLA scores (Table 1). To obtain summary scores for the D-KEFS, we performed the same factor analysis (a principal components analysis using Varimax with Kaiser normalization) on the D-KEFS sub-scores as specified in {37}. To explore components of the composite scores, we performed subsequent correlations between the number of COMT val and BDNF met alleles (termed the allele dosage -- 0, 1, or 2 per subject) and measures of cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms.

Imaging

A 1.5-T GE MRI scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) and standard quadrature head coil were used to obtain all images. A T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo sequence was used to generate 124 contiguous 1.5-mm-thick axial slices (repetition time = 6.1 msec; echo time = min full; flip angle = 20°; field of view = 240 mm; 124 slices, slices’ thickness 1.5 mm; matrix size = 256 × 256 × 124). VBM analysis of the data was performed with SPM8 and followed the principles outlined by Ridgway et al. {48}. Except as noted below, all default SPM options were used. Images were segmented into gray matter, white matter, and CSF. Spatial normalization, segmentation, and modulation are processed using a unified segmentation algorithm {49}. This algorithm simultaneously calculates image registration, tissue classification, and bias correction using our participants’ structural MR images combined with the tissue probability maps provided in SPM. The segmented and modulated normalized gray matter images were smoothed with a 8 mm full width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. An explicit mask encompassing the entire brain was used in the analyses to control for background signal outside the brain. This mask was downloaded from the SPM Anatomic Automatic Labeling toolbox (www.cyceron.fr/freeware). A 0.05 explicit absolute threshold for masking was used in the SPM second-level model interface {50}. Total intracranial volume was calculated in SPM8 from the unsmoothed, modulated gray matter, white matter, and CSF images from each patient and used as a nuisance variable to account for the possible effect of varying brain volumes.

Two sets of imaging analyses were performed. First, two whole brain ANOVAs were performed in SPM comparing 2 to 0 copies of the COMT val and BDNF met alleles on grey matter volumes. Clusters surviving an uncorrected threshold of p&lt;0.001 and a cluster size of 30 voxels were considered significant {3}. Second, the Marsbar toolbox was used to create ROIs from clusters found to be significant on the whole brain analysis, as in {3}. Mean grey matter intensity values were extracted from these ROIs and used for correlations with our cognitive and behavioral measures.

Results

Demographics

We examined a total of 174 participants with FTLD-spectrum illnesses. Table 1 summarizes the results of our analysis of the relationship between COMT val and BDNF met allele dosage and composite cognitive, behavioral, and motor measures in FTLD patients as well as demographic data for the cohort. There were no statistically significant differences in the demographics of FTD and PPA vs. CBS groups (data not shown). Therefore, in analyzing the effect of BDNF and COMT polymorphisms, these groups were combined. There was no effect of BDNF or COMT polymorphism on age of onset or other demographic variables (Table 1).

Cognitive, behavioral, and motor analyses

In the principal components analysis, the measures of the correlation between the variables were good, indicating that a principle components analysis is appropriate (the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure was 0.83 and Barlett’s Test of Sphericity had a χ2 of 1337.71, df 190, p &lt; 0.001). Five components had an eigen value greater than 1.0 accounting for 75.5% of the total value. Each of the five components corresponded to a single D-KEFS test, i.e. each of the subtests were significantly loaded (absolute value greater than 0.70 on the rotated component matrix) with only one D-KEFS test. There was a significant effect of the COMT val allele on our composite executive function measure, F(1, 76)=6.14, p=0.015, but no significant effect of the COMT val allele on the memory or motor composite measures. Correlations between the D-KEFS subtests and allele dosage revealed that the significant effect of COMT on executive function was due to its effect on the Sorting test (r=0.22, two-tailed p=0.049, corresponding to a Cohen’s d of 0.45 and a r2 of 0.05). None of the other correlations between the D-KEFS subtest factor scores and COMT or BDNF allele dosage were significant. There was a significant effect, surviving correction for multiple comparisons, of the BDNF met allele only on depressive symptoms as measured by the NPI, F(1, 136)=9.50, p=0.002 (Table 1). The BDNF met allele did not have a significant effect on the composite motor measure.

Imaging

Two versus zero BDNF alleles did not have a significant effect on grey matter volume in the whole brain analysis. A COMT val dosage of 2 was significantly associated with reduced grey matter volume in the bilateral caudate nuclei compared to a dose of 0 (Figure 1). Within the areas found to have significantly reduced grey matter volume, grey matter density was negatively correlated with Verbal Fluency and Sorting subtests of the D-KEFS, with the conceptualization subscale of the MDRS-2, and visual memory on the WMS-III. Grey matter density in the right and left caudate was also negatively correlated with the total NPI and several of the NPI subscales including agitation, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, and motor behavior (Table 2).

Discussion

In patients with FTD and CBS, a greater number of met alleles at position 66 of BDNF was associated with more depressive symptoms, and more val alleles at position 158 of COMT was associated with poorer performance on the D-KEFS Sorting task, a test of executive function. We did not find an effect of either polymorphism on motor function. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown associations between the COMT val158met and DRD4 polymorphisms and executive function {15, 29} and the BDNF val66met polymorphism and depression {12, 13}. However, this is the first time that BDNF polymorphisms have been implicated in the clinical presentation of FTLD illnesses. Unexpectedly, the effect is that a greater number of BDNF met alleles is associated with decreased depression. This is the opposite direction from the direction that has been observed in most previous studies in neurologically-intact participants {51, 52}, although it is the same direction we observed in our previous study on recovery of executive function after TBI {14}. As can be seen in Table 2, the anatomic association between depression and caudate grey matter density is also the opposite direction of the associations with most of the other neuropsychiatric symptoms, i.e., greater grey matter density is associated with greater depression. However, these results agree with previous findings that suggest that damage to certain brain structures and regions can be protective against internalizing psychiatric symptoms including depression and anxiety {53–56}. Our subsequent analyses showing an association between our cognitive and behavioral measures and the grey matter density in the caudate nuclei further supports the relationship between COMT genotype and phenotypic presentation in FTLD (Table 2).

The effect size of BDNF allele dosage on depression, as well as the COMT allele dosage on the Sorting test in FTLD patients, is medium (Cohen’s d=0.45), accounting for approximately 5% of the variance. This is similar to the amount of variance accounted for by the BDNF val66met polymorphism on executive function in the recovery from acute brain injury (6%) {14}. But it is considerably larger than the effects of both of these polymorphisms in healthy subjects {3, 12, 57}. This may suggest that these polymorphisms play a larger role in the setting of brain dysfunction than in cognition in healthy subjects.

In our MRI analysis, we found that having two val alleles at codon 158 of COMT was associated with decreased grey matter volumes only in the bilateral caudate nucleus (Figure 1) compared to zero val alleles. In Gennatas et al. (2012) {3}, the authors also found grey matter volume changes associated with increasing COMT val dose in DA-innervated brain regions including the striatum in patients with dementia, including FTLD. In both studies, associations were observed between cognitive measures, behavioral measures, and grey matter density within DA-innervated brain regions (Table 2). Thus, we can assert with greater confidence the conclusions that were reached by Gennatas et al.: Increased synaptic DA catabolism associated with the COMT val allele appears to promote neurodegeneration within DA-innervated brain areas. However, Gennatas et al. found this in several brain structures, while we found a significant association only in the bilateral caudate. This difference could be, in part, due to differences in our patient groups. Gennatas et al., included patients with Alzheimer’s disease, bvFTD, and semantic dementia in their study; whereas this study is limited to patients with FTLD-spectrum illnesses. Also, our patient group included individuals with CBS, who have more disease involvement of the basal ganglia than other FTLD patients {58}.

The specificity we found of the volume loss related to COMT genotype for the caudate is striking (Figure 1). The caudate is heavily DA-innervated {59}, and the caudate and putamen receive extensive afferent projections from the cerebral cortex {60}. In CBS, the caudate and putamen show significant tau deposition, but so do several other structures including primary motor cortex and the subthalamic nucleus {61}. Asall FTLD disorders involve significant cortical degeneration of areas that project to the basal ganglia, one might expect that the caudate, as a major target of those projections, could be particularly affected. Indeed, there is animal evidence that the caudate is more vulnerable to DA depletion than other structures in the basal ganglia {59}.

Alzheimer’s disease appears to selectively target the cholinergic neurotransmitter system and most available treatments for this illness increase available acetylcholine. The brain areas affected in FTD receive extensive dopaminergic and serotonergic projections {62}. However, it has not been known if this is an anatomical coincidence, i.e., the disease process targets the frontal and anterior temporal lobes and these just happen to receive dopaminergic and serotonergic projections, or whether these neurotransmitter systems influence the tropism and progression of the illness. The current and related studies {3, 4} suggest that the DA system can affect the presentation of the illness and that DA-innervated areas may be particularly vulnerable.

Together, the findings of this study suggest that COMT and BDNF polymorphisms may explain, in part, the phenotypic variability of FTD and CBS. Further, the results from this and other studies underline the importance of DA balance in FTLD and support the trial of medications augmenting dopamine in patients with FTD. Indeed, clinical trials of COMT inhibition in FTLD patients are underway (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00604591).
