pmc1. Introduction

The Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) haplotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer‟s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and reduced brain activity both at rest and during task performance (Agosta et al., 2012; Corder et al., 1993; Farrer et al., 1997; McKenna, Koo, Killiany, &amp; Initiative, 2016). Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is used to examine spontaneous changes over time in the amount of deoxygenated vs. oxygenated blood used to meet metabolic demand, a proxy for neural activity at baseline with no task (Ma et al., 2016). These spontaneous fluctuations are highly correlated within and across certain brain regions, resulting in consistent neural networks (Damoiseaux et al., 2006). Less neural network strength (i.e., functional connectivity or coupling) distinguishes patients with AD from cognitively unimpaired controls, and adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who later convert to AD from those who remain stable (Binnewijzend et al., 2012; Sorg et al., 2007). Further, older unimpaired adults with APOE ε4 show less neural connectivity in the absence of amyloid deposition (Sheline et al., 2010). There are also some studies focusing on the association and interaction between APOE / TOMM40 and biomarkers (amyloid, tau or brain microstructure) (Siddarth et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2020), and the interaction between amyloid and APOE would be seen as targets of AD‟s prevention and/or treatment (Serrano-Pozo, Das, &amp; Hyman, 2021; Wisniewski &amp; Drummond, 2020). However, fMRI network activity has been used for detecting early AD-related cognitive impairment (Greicius, Srivastava, Reiss, &amp; Menon, 2004; Z. Liu et al., 2012; Rombouts, Barkhof, Goekoop, Stam, &amp; Scheltens, 2005) because it is sensitive and cheap (de Vos et al., 2018; Teipel et al., 2017).

The most common network examined is the Default Mode Network (DMN), which is vulnerable to AD (Buckner et al., 2009). This network robustly shows progressively less activity in adults who are at-risk or have MCI or AD. DMN consists of bilateral angular gyri, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex in the parietal lobe; anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices in the frontal lobe; hippocampus; and thalamus (Binnewijzend et al., 2012). All of these areas show less glucose metabolism across the AD continuum. Yet, many other networks exist that regulate executive function, emotion regulation, memory recognition, association, and other behaviors or internal processes relevant to AD. Thus, we explored a comprehensive set of 21 neural networks determined in the UK Biobank (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018; Sudlow et al., 2015), a robust sample utilizing tens of thousands of scans.

Likewise, in genomics the APOE ε4 haplotype receives the majority of attention in AD, despite the other two APOE haplogroups. Specifically, it is unclear how the protective APOE ε2 allele (Corder et al., 1994) and “neutral risk” ε3 allele differ with regard to activity in these non-DMN networks, particularly in the context of other AD risk factors such as age and sex. Most especially, it is worthwhile to consider that genes surrounding the APOE gene on Chromosome 19 may also be relevant to detecting early hypoactivation in these networks. For example, Kulminski and colleagues discovered that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found on the APOE, TOMM40, and APOC1 genes work in concert to increase the risk of AD (Kulminski, Philipp, Loika, He, &amp; Culminskaya, 2020). While several of these genes are in moderate linkage disequilibrium with APOE, at-risk genotypes may nonetheless impact neural network function. This would be critically important for early detection of participants who will eventually go on to develop AD.

In particular, Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 40kD (TOMM40) is a nuclear-encoded gene that facilitates the import of nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins, a process critical for cellular bioenergetics (Humphries et al., 2005). Many studies have shown that a G vs. A SNP on rs2075650 (‘650) increases the risk for normal cognitive decline and also AD (Bagnoli et al., 2013; Omoumi et al., 2014; Valant et al., 2012). Other TOMM40 genotypes suggest that the ‘650 variant may also be related to neural network activity. For example, Evidence of rsfMRI characteristics suggested that the TOMM40 rs157581 SNP polymorphism could be associated with spontaneous regional brain activity (X. Liu et al., 2014). Specifically, TOMM40 rs157581-G AD carriers would have some brain functional connectivity decreased, and in their in the bilateral temporal, the low-frequency fluctuation amplitude also reduced (Xiao et al., 2019).

It is still open to debate whether these associations merely reflect LD with APOE (Davies et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2007). These studies only covaried the number of APOE ε4 alleles, however, and so a more careful consideration of the 3 APOE haplogroups and a larger sample may unravel the association with neural network strength. APOE stratification may also uncover synergistic effects with TOMM40. For example, it may be that APOE ε4 shows independent relationships itself, in conjunction with TOMM40 ‘650, or possibly both depending on the phenotype. It may be easier to disentangle such effects using neural networks sensitive to AD vs. normal aging, rather than cognition or other biomarkers that appear much later in the disease process.

Accordingly, using genetic and rsfMRI data from the UK Biobank cohort, we tested the following associations on neural network strength at rest: 1) the main effects of the APOE haplotypes and interactions with sex and age; 2) the main effects of TOMM40 ‘650 polymorphism and interactions with sex and age, among all participants; and 3) TOMM40 ‘650 polymorphism main effects and interactions with sex and age stratified by APOE. This study will clarify how APOE and TOMM40 risk variation influences early neural markers of AD, which in turn could improve precision medicine for disease treatment.

2. Methods

2.1. Cohort and Participants

The UK Biobank cohort includes a half million participants, aged 40 to 70 years at baseline recruitment, from 22 assessment centers located in the United Kingdom (Sudlow et al., 2015). There was a uniform lag for all participants between enrollment and measurement. The current study examined a sub-cohort of 8,222 participants with genomics, MRI, and demographics data. Participants completed informed consent prior to baseline examination. The cohort used for the current analyses is strictly British Europeans, as outlined by Bycroft and colleagues (Bycroft et al., 2018), due to racial and ethnic differences observed for the APOE haplotypes (Farrer et al., 1997). Participants with central nervous system disorders, cerebrovascular diseases, and any of the dementias were also excluded from the sample (see Supplementary Figure 1).

2.2. Genotyping

For TOMM40, genotype data for the SNP ‘650 were extracted for analyses using PLINK version 1.90 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/). TOMM40 ‘650 status was coded as those who were non-G carriers (AA homozygotes) versus G-carriers (GA and GG). TOMM40 ‘650 was in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p = 0.6976), indicating that frequency counts for these genotypes were in line with the general population. For APOE haplotype, a similar process was used for SNPs rs429358 and rs7412. Participants were categorized as having ε2, ε3, or ε4 isoforms. Participants classified as APOE ε2/ε4 were excluded from analyses. Linkage disequilibrium was also tested between rs2075650 and the APOE SNPs rs429358(R2=.546) and rs7412 (R2=.012).

2.3. Resting State fMRI – Acquisition and Processing

Participants were scanned at one of three sites in Reading, Newcastle, or Manchester on a Siemens Skyra 3T unit with a 32-channel RF receiver head coil (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) (Miller et al., 2016). Baseline MRI visits began in 2014 and longitudinal data collection is ongoing (Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018). Participants were instructed to simply focus on a crosshair with eyes open and not think about anything specifically. Scan duration was 6 minutes and 10 seconds, to acquire 490 images with the following acquisition parameters: TR = 735ms; TE = 39ms; 2.4 × 2.4 × 2.4mm voxel resolution; 88 × 88 × 64 matrix, multiband factor = 8, in-plane acceleration factor = 1, flip angle 52°. Preprocessing and quality control measures are described in UK Biobank white papers (https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf). Briefly, using FSL tools, the 4D dataset was motion-corrected, grand-mean intensity normalized, high-pass temporal filtered (with sigma = 50.0s), and EPI and GDC unwarped and denoised (using ICA+FIX processing). Group Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis through FMRIB‟s MELODIC were then used to derive 21 spatially orthogonal, non-noise, distinctive Independent Components (ICs) that represent resting neural networks (Kapogiannis, Reiter, Willette, &amp; Mattson, 2013). Each participant has a Z-score for a given IC, representing the degree of activation relative to the group mean. An expert (AAW) then viewed the activation maps and described the neural networks (see Supplementary Table 1).

2.4. Covariates

For main effect and interaction analyses of APOE or TOMM40 ‘650 genotype, covariates included factors that may protect or weaken neural network strength such as sex, age at recruitment, social class, education level, and family history of AD. Social class was categorically derived from gross annual household income between 2008 and 2014 as “lower class” (&lt;£18,000), “middle class” (£18,000-£51,999), and “upper class” (£52 000 to &gt; £100,000). Education level was categorized as: college or higher qualifications (3); post-secondary or vocational (2); secondary (1); and none of the above (0).

2.5. Statistical Analysis

Multiple linear regression equations were modeled using R, version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Programming, Vienna, Austria) and SPSS 26 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Initial analyses tested the main effect of APOE haplotype (ε2, ε3, ε4) on all 21 neural networks, followed by interactions with age in years and sex. The ε3 allele group was set as the reference group. ANCOVA was used in follow-up tests to examine differences among APOE groups. Next, we examined the main effect of TOMM40 ‘650 G carriage and interactions with age in years and sex. APOE was added to the TOMM40 models as a covariate and recoded as a dichotomous variable based on whether the participant carried ε4 or not. These analyses were conducted across all participants.

Finally, TOMM40 ‘650 G carriage analyses were repeated, but now separately in each of the APOE haplogroups (ε2 = ε2/ ε2, ε2/ ε3; ε3= ε3/ ε3; ε4= ε3/ ε4, ε4/ ε4) with regard for age and sex. As we and others show, there is moderate genetic linkage disequilibrium between TOMM40 ‘650 and one of the major APOE SNPs, rs429358, but not APOE rs7412 (Corder et al., 1993; Deelen et al., 2011; Farrer et al., 1997; Potkin et al., 2009). However, to date, most studies of TOMM40 have covaried the number of APOE ε4 alleles, which may overlook effects of the ‘650 SNP. To examine if independent (Elias-Sonnenschein et al., 2013; Omoumi et al., 2014), dependent (Soyal et al., 2020), or synergistic (Ferencz, Karlsson, &amp; Kalpouzos, 2012; Moon et al., 2015) gene x gene effects manifest, it is more appropriate to test TOMM40 ‘650 when stratified by APOE ε2, ε3, or ε4 carriage.

ANCOVA was used in follow-up tests to examine differences between ‘650 G vs. non-G carriers. To address Power, sensitivity analyses were conducted for each set of studies using GPower 3.1 (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009). Significant effects (ps&lt;.05) were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Scheffe method because the groups have unequal sample sizes. Family-wise Alpha was set at p=0.05. Estimated marginal means were calculated using emmeans (Lenth, Singmann, Love, Buerkner, &amp; Herve, 2020). The figures were produced using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2019) and SPSS 26.

2.6. Corrections for Multiple Comparisons

A total of 21 neural networks were examined, requiring multiple comparison correction to avoid false positives. For each predictor of interest (i.e., APOE haplotype, TOMM40 genotype), a series of Type I error correction techniques were utilized. First, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) omnibus test was conducted. If the omnibus was significant, follow-up models were completed with a family-wise error rate of .05 (Hummel &amp; Sligo, 1971). If the omnibus MANCOVA was not significant (p&gt;.05), a Holm-Bonferroni correction was applied as described in previous work (Willette, Modanlo, Kapogiannis, &amp; Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging, 2015).

3. Results

3.1. Descriptive Statistics

The sample included 8,222 participants. Demographic and clinical data are presented in Table 1. The average age of participants was 55 years (SD = 7.47) and approximately 52% were women. Most participants had a college or higher qualification. Slightly more than half participants reported incomes of between £18,000 - £51,999 (i.e., “middle class”).

3.2. APOE Only - Main Effects and Interactions

In contrast with ε3 carriers, ε4 carriers as expected had significant less network strength in executive function, memory retrieval, memory storage, motor planning, posterior default mode, and language processing networks (see Figure 1 and Table 2). Conversely, ε2 carriers when compared to ε3 carriers had more neural activity only in a network composed of posterior DMN. No age, sex, or exploratory age by sex interactions were observed with APOE ε4 carriers for any resting state network.

3.3. TOMM40 ‘650 Only - Main Effects and Interactions

For main effects, ‘650 G-allele carriage was associated with more network strength only in an auditory and language comprehension network (see Table 3; Figure 2, left panel). Those APOE ε4 vs. non-ε4 carriers had less activity in this auditory/language network and posterior DMN (Figure 2, right panel). Based on a ‘650 Carriage by Sex interaction for the auditory/language network (p=.0453, G carrier vs. non-carrier), G-carrier men had more network strength (Mdiff=.072, SE=.023, p=.020), but G-carrier women did not (Mdiff=.007, SE=.022, p&gt;0.10). No other two-way or exploratory 3-way interactions were present.

3.4. TOMM40 ‘650 Stratified by APOE Haplotype – Main Effects and Interactions

There were no main effects or 2-way interactions with sex or age for any APOE haplogroup. Among APOE ε4 carriers, every neural network showed robust 3-way interactions between TOMM40 ‘650 G carriage, sex, and age (all p&lt;.001) (Table 4). Figure 3 illustrates an example with DMN, where the relationship between age in years and network strength is modified by sex and TOMM40 ‘650. For TOMM40 ‘650 non-G carriers, per year of age, older women but not men showed less network strength. By contrast, among both sexes identically, TOMM40 ‘650 G carriers showed less network strength per year of age. There were no 3-way TOMM40 ‘650 x age x sex interactions present among APOE ε4 non-carriers.

4. Discussion

This study examined main effects and interactions among different APOE or TOMM40 ‘650 genotypes alone, and analyzed TOMM40 when stratified by APOE ε2, ε3, or ε4. As expected, APOE ε itself was related to less activity in several resting state networks relevant to AD, including memory consolidation, central executive function, and the posterior portion of default mode network (Sheline et al., 2010). While normative aging affects the whole brain, the posterior DMN is the most sensitive network in patients with AD (Klaassens et al., 2017). Similar work has established the role of APOE ε4 in worse episodic memory(Kerchner et al., 2014). Although lower executive function was observed in non-APOE ε4 carriers(Wolk, Dickerson, &amp; Initiative, 2010), the ε4 carriers demonstrated more rapid executive function decline in community-dwelling older adults (Reas et al., 2019). Cortical auditory processing has also been deemed a relevant biomarker for preclinical AD, but not with APOE ε4 (Tuwaig et al., 2017).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine independent, dependent, and synergistic associations between TOMM40 ‘650, APOE, and resting state neural networks. TOMM40 ‘650 G carriage by itself, after covarying APOE, appears to specifically influence auditory and language comprehension network processing. These processes encompass the Wernicke‟s area, prefrontal and subcortical brain regions, demonstrating the large magnitude of this network (Tomasi &amp; Volkow, 2012). Aside from memory, progressive language impairment can be a feature of AD (Verma &amp; Howard, 2012). Unexpectedly, the ‘650 G risk allele was related to more network strength, specifically for men but not women. Another UK Biobank Study also observed that men had more functional connectivity between unimodal sensory and motor cortices (Ritchie et al., 2018). Cavedo et al. suggested that compared with women, older adult men could have lower resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (Cavedo et al., 2018). Therefore, men with the high-risk G-allele could be showing increased activity as some sort of compensatory strategy specific to language processing. While we did observe sex effects across all neural networks, sex alone is not enough to distinguish individual brain resting state patterns (Weis et al., 2020).

When examining TOMM40 ‘650 associations stratified by APOE genotype, age and sex appeared to uncover key gene x gene interactions for the APOE ε4 risk group. While it has been well documented that older age drives reduced neural network strength (Buckner et al., 2005), this did not hold true for men without the ‘650 G allele in our study. It is unclear why only men may be affected. Nonetheless, modulation of APOE ε4 by TOMM40 ‘650 may help to elucidate why APOE ε4 carriage shows phenotypic variation among middle-aged to early aged adults.

There are notable limitations to address. Since our sample was comprised of British Europeans, our results may not be generalized to other ethnic/racial groups. While TOMM40 ‘650 polymorphisms contribute similarly to AD in White and Asian populations (Huang et al., 2016), future analyses with more diverse cohorts will be needed to examine modulation by race or ethnicity. While follow-up MRI scans are being conducted by UK Biobank, existing data are cross-sectional and correlational. Thus, causality cannot be implied. Despite the limitations outlined, there are strengths to note. We used a large sample to determine genetic effects on resting state neural networks, which is an early marker of AD pathology. A total of 21 networks were examined rather than focusing solely on the DMN. Finally, we tested interactions with age and sex, which provided further insight about how TOMM40 ‘650 G-carrier status impacts men and women differently.

Taken together, our study results indicated that TOMM40 rs’650 genotype impacts neural network strength among middle-aged to older adults. The current study may reflect that more neural networks are vulnerable to APOE ε4 than the TOMM40 polymorphism, but that ‘650 G-carriage nonetheless can strongly influence how sex and age are related to network strength. Assessment of functional neural network strength at multiple time points may uncover changes with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Novel AD genetic risk factors without LD to APOE should also be examined with resting state network strength as an outcome, as aforementioned studies besides the current study have demonstrated its utility (Binnewijzend et al., 2012; Sorg et al., 2007).

Bolded text denotes p&lt;.001 for fit lines of sub-groups. Beta values are mean ±standard deviation. Only neural networks with significant TOMM40 ‘650 x age x sex interactions (p&lt;.001) are reported.

Highlights

Sex modifies the relationship between TOMM40 ‘650 and network strength

interactions between ‘650, sex, and age were in APOE4 carriers‟ neural networks

Older ‘650 G and APOE4 carriers showed less neural network connectivity
