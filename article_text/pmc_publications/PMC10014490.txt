Recently, Duff et al. (2021) developed and initially validated two new recognition subtests for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) in a cohort of older adults who were cognitively intact or classified as amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The current paper extends that validation by comparing the recall and recognition subtests of the RBANS, including the existing and recently developed scores, to three commonly used biomarkers in AD in an expanded sample from the initial validation. One hundred fifty-four older adults (65 intact, 46 MCI, 43 AD) were administered the RBANS, which included the recently developed subtests for Story Recognition and Figure Recognition (hits, false positives, total correct), as part of a study on memory and biomarkers. Participants also completed magnetic resonance imaging to obtain hippocampal volumes, positron emission tomography to obtain amyloid plaque deposition, and a blood draw to obtain APOE ε4 status. Whereas correlations between recall scores and biomarkers tended to be moderate (average r = ±0.48), these correlations were comparable across the three recognition total scores (average r = ±0.42), but tended to be lower for recognition hits (average r = ±0.28) and false positives (average r = ±0.38). These results further validate the existing and recently developed recognition scores on the RBANS as providing useful information about brain and genetic pathology in older adults with intact and impaired cognitive functioning.

pmcMemory testing is a critical part of assessment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its potential precursor state of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Within memory tests, differences between delayed recall and recognition can aid in distinguishing primary impairments in encoding and retention of new information from difficulties in spontaneous retrieval. Characterizing these patterns is crucial to differentiating between what have been heuristically understood as “cortical” dementias, like AD, and “subcortical,” conditions like dementia due to Huntington’s or Parkinson’s disease (Salmon &amp; Bondi, 2009; Salmon &amp; Filoteo, 2007)1. Specifically, whereas a decreased learning slope over initial learning trials (e.g., several presentations of a word-list) and impaired free recall following a delay can characterize many forms of dementia, impairments in the ability to differentiate previously encountered material from novel distractors distinguishes the memory retention deficit that typifies AD from the retrieval deficit exemplified in prototypical subcortical dementias and other non-amnestic conditions (Bondi et al., 2017; Harciarek &amp; Jodzio, 2005; Tierney et al., 2001).

Moreover, combined memory scores, which include both recall and recognition memory, have excellent sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing AD from normal aging (Weissberger et al., 2017), and show promise for predicting conversion from amnestic MCI to AD (Russo et al., 2017). Studies have also established higher rates of false positives errors and poorer recognition discriminability in individuals with AD relative to subcortical dementias (Brandt et al., 1992; Delis et al., 1991; Hildebrandt et al., 2009), and in MCI relative to cognitively intact older adults (Greenaway et al., 2006). These findings likely reflect the fact that, in yes/no recognition testing, MCI and AD participants often perform comparably to intact groups with regard to recognition hits, but commit an elevated number of false positive errors (L. R. Clark et al., 2012; Greenaway et al., 2006; Libon et al., 2011), making the latter a more sensitive measure of AD-related impairments and pathology. Indeed, some authors have even suggested that elevated false positives in AD may reflect the adverse effects of amyloid plaque deposition on the quality of memory encoding (see: Hildebrandt et al., 2009). Overall, characterizing the properties and broader correlates of recall and recognition memory testing is an important issue in neuropsychological assessment of memory dysfunction in possible AD.

The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Randolph, 1998) is a widely-used battery of brief neuropsychological tests, with demonstrated utility in assessing a variety of disorders, including neurodegenerative conditions. Many studies have demonstrated the utility of various RBANS scores for identifying cognitive impairments in individuals with various conditions, including AD and amnestic MCI (J. H. Clark et al., 2010; Duff et al., 2008; Karantzoulis et al., 2013), traumatic brain injury (McKay et al., 2008), Huntington’s disease (Duff, Beglinger, et al., 2010), Parkinson’s disease (Beatty et al., 2003), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (Duff, McDermott, et al., 2019), schizophrenia (Zhang et al., 2015), and end-stage liver disease (Mooney et al., 2007), among others. A number of studies have also established the utility of RBANS scores for documenting change over time in individuals in various disorders (Beglinger et al., 2010; Duff, Randolph, et al., 2019; Hammers et al., 2020; Rinehardt et al., 2010). Most relevant to the current study is that the diagnostic accuracy of the RBANS has good differentiation of individuals with AD from community-dwelling seniors (Duff et al., 2008), with memory measures being especially successful in distinguishing amnestic MCI or AD from cognitively intact individuals or other disorders (J. H. Clark et al., 2010; Duff, Hobson, et al., 2010; Karantzoulis et al., 2013; McDermott &amp; DeFilippis, 2010).

Notwithstanding these strengths, one limitation of the RBANS has been the relative lack of recognition subtests to assess memory dysfunction (Randolph, 2012). Specifically, although the RBANS provides multiple formats for assessing immediate and delayed memory—List Learning and Recall, Story Memory and Recall, and Figure Copy and Recall—until recently, recognition testing was only available for the word list material. To address this limitation, Duff and colleagues (2021) developed and presented an initial validation of two novel subtests to assess Story Recognition and Figure Recognition. In comparing performance between cognitively-intact older adults and those with either amnestic MCI or mild AD, results were consistent with expectations, such that intact participants had higher recognition total scores and hits, and fewer false positives, than the two impaired groups across both subtests. For Story Recognition, MCI participants also had higher total scores than AD participants, but similar numbers of hits and false positive errors. For Figure Recognition, MCI participants performed comparably to AD participants across all three measures. Correlations generally indicated large associations between recognition scores and recall scores for the same material (e.g., correlating List Recall with List Recognition Total Scores, etc.), as well as across all combinations of recall and recognition scores (most rs ~.50-.85: Brydges, 2019; Gignac &amp; Szodorai, 2016). Finally, secondary analyses of internal consistency for the new subtests indicated adequate reliability for Story Recognition (Cronbach’s alpha = .78), but lower reliability for Figure Recognition (Cronbach’s alpha = .58; Duff, Suhrie, Dalley, et al., 2021).

Building on these initial findings, a further step toward supporting the use of these new recognition subtests in AD diagnosis and research would be to examine their associations with common AD biomarkers, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele status, hippocampal volumes, and cerebral amyloid plaque levels. A number of studies have examined biomarker correlates of the RBANS Total Score and Delayed Memory Index, which both include contributions from List Recognition. Those studies have found the expected pattern of results, with smaller overall brain or hippocampal volumes (England et al., 2014; Ottoy et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2011; Teng et al., 2019), and greater amyloid deposition (Duff et al., 2013; Hammers et al., 2017; Ottoy et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2019), being associated with poorer performance in individuals across the AD spectrum. A recent study extended these results by additionally examining APOE status, along with amyloid plaque deposition and hippocampal volumes, across all RBANS Indexes and subtests in a sample of intact older adults and those with MCI and AD (Duff, Suhrie, Hammers, et al., 2021). In examining correlations across the full sample, results indicated associations in the expected direction for nearly all RBANS scores. Most notably, there were strong inverse relations for amyloid deposition and the Immediate and Delayed Memory Indexes (and their constituent subtests), followed by moderate-to-large associations between memory scores and hippocampal volumes, and smaller correlations between memory scores and APOE status. Correlations for List Recognition in particular ranged from large to moderate across measures of cerebral amyloid, hippocampal volume, and APOE status, respectively. Nevertheless, no study has yet examined biomarker correlates of the latest Story and Figure Recognitions subtests for the RBANS. Therefore, this study aimed to further validate these novel subtests by examining their associations with common AD biomarkers in the form of cerebral amyloid, hippocampal volumes, and APOE status. Consistent with prior research, we hypothesized inverse relationships between recognition memory performance and amyloid plaque deposition and APOE ε4 carrier status, and positive relationships with hippocampal volumes. Establishing associations between these novel recognition memory tasks and AD biomarkers would further validate them as additional measures for use in research and clinical assessment of MCI and AD.

Methods

Participants

One hundred fifty-four older adults participated in the current study. They were recruited via independent living facilities, senior centers, and from a cognitive disorders clinic, as part of a larger study on neuropsychological and biomarker correlates of cognitive change in AD. Inclusion criteria required participants to be 65 years-old or older, and to have a collateral source able to comment on their level of daily function. Participants diagnosed with AD were required to have a legally authorized representative who was able to provide informed consent. There were no requirements pertaining to handedness, reading level, or level of education. The full study sample was comprised of 65 cognitively intact older adults, 46 individuals with MCI, and 43 individuals with AD. Overall, the sample predominantly identified as female (57.1%), white/non-Hispanic (98.7%), and was highly educated (mean = 16.06 years, SD = 2.49). Table 1 lists demographic information for the sample according to group status.

Procedure

All participants or their authorized representatives provided written informed consent prior to participation, and all study procedures were approved by the local IRB. After obtaining participant consent/assent, participants were administered a neuropsychological battery to confirm group status and assess current cognitive functioning. Approximately one week later participants returned for an MRI of the brain. Several weeks later, participants returned for PET amyloid imaging and a blood draw to determine APOE ε4 status. Participants were compensated for their time.

Group Classification

Using the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) criteria, participants were classified as cognitively intact, amnestic MCI, or AD. Specifically, participants were classified as MCI if they scored between 24-30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975), earned a raw score ≤8 on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory II delayed recall Paragraph A (Wechsler, 1987), and had greater than or equal to 16 years of education (or scored ≤4 with 8-15 years education, or ≤2 with 0-7 years education), and had an overall Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 0.5 (Morris, 1993). Participants were classified as having probable AD if they met these same education-adjusted criteria for Logical Memory II, and scored between 20-26 on the MMSE and had a CDR rating of 0.5 or 1. Participants performing above these cut-offs were classified as intact.

Exclusion criteria for the study included any history of the following: major stroke; diagnosed neurological illness other than AD; head injury resulting in a loss of consciousness ≥ 30 minutes; current or past major psychiatric illness; history of substance abuse; current use of antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medications; a Geriatric Depression Scale score greater than 6 (15-item version); or any allergies, sensory/motor issues; or other conditions that would prevent completion of study procedures (e.g., metal implants that preclude MRI, sensory impairments that would preclude participation in the cognitive assessments). To help ensure that no individuals with non-AD pathologies were included among the MCI and AD groups, medical records were reviewed. Any individuals showing documented evidence of non-AD pathologies (e.g., parkinsonism, reports of fluctuating cognition), and/or neuropsychological evidence of primary impairments in non-memory domains (e.g., language, processing speed, executive functioning) were excluded from the study.

RBANS and Recognition Memory Testing

During the initial visit, participants were also administered the full RBANS according to standardized procedures. Immediately following the delayed recall subtests for the respective material, participants were also administered the novel Story Recognition and Figure Recognition subtests as recently described by Duff, Suhrie, Dalley et al. (2021). In brief, the Story Recognition subtest requires participants to identify previous story elements and correctly discriminate them from distractors. The subtest involves a total of 10 valid story elements and 10 randomly interspersed distractors, and generates scores for Total Correct, Hits, and False Positive Errors. In the Figure Recognition subtest, participants are shown 10 Figure Recall drawing and placement elements amidst 10 distractors on 3” x 5” cards in a flip booklet. Each figure element is presented without the surrounding context of the larger figure. As with Story Recognition, scores are generated for Total Correct, Hits, and False Positives Errors.

MRI

Structural brain MRIs were obtained via a 3.0 T Siemens Prisma scanner using a 64-channel head coil. An MP2RAGE sequence was used (TR = 5000, TE = 2.93, sagittal acquisition) with a resolution of 1 mm3. All scans were screened for motion and other artifacts and were processed on a single workstation running FreeSurfer version 6.0 https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/. The automated FreeSurfer parcellation pipeline (Fischl et al., 2002, 2004; see details in: Fischl &amp; Dale, 2000) was used to extract left and right hippocampal volumes, which were normalized by estimated total intracranial volume, and summed to produce an overall hippocampal volume value. All segmentations were manually reviewed prior to statistical analyses. Due to poor segmentation in some participants, hippocampal data were not available for three individuals with MCI and 14 with AD, resulting in a maximum sample size of 134 for analyses involving hippocampal volumes.

Amyloid Imaging

Amyloid imaging was performed using 18F-Flutemetamol which is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for PET imaging of the brain to estimate beta-amyloid neuritic plaque density in adult patients with cognitive impairment. 18F-Flutemetamol was produced under PET cGMP standards and conducted under an approved FDA Investigational New Drug application (IND). Twenty minutes of emission imaging was performed 90 minutes after the injection of approximately 185 mBq (5 mCi) of 18F-Flutemetamol. A GE Discovery PET/CT 710 (GE Healthcare) was used in this study. This PET/CT scanner has full width at half-maximum spatial resolution of 5.0 mm and excellent performance characteristics (Sunderland &amp; Christian, 2015; Yester et al., 2014). Volumes of interest were automatically generated by using the CortexID Suite analysis software (GE Healthcare). 18F-Flutemetamol binding was analyzed using a regional semi-quantitative technique described by Vandenberghe (2010) and refined by Thurfjell et al. (2014). The CortexID Suite software generates semi-quantitative, regional (prefrontal, anterior cingulate, precuneus/posterior cingulate, parietal, mesial temporal, lateral temporal, occipital, sensorimotor, cerebellar grey matter, and whole cerebellum) standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) normalized to the pons. A composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in the cerebral cortex was generated automatically and normalized to the pons using the CortexID Suite software (Lundqvist et al., 2013).

APOE status

APOE status was determined by means of a blood draw. Samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence monitoring via hybridization probes to assess APOE genotyping. For purposes of the present analyses, participants were classified as being APOE ε4 positive if they were either heterozygous or homozygous for the ε4 allele, or negative if they were non-carriers.

Data Analysis

As preliminary analyses, we first examined group differences in demographic factors (age, sex, education, etc.), using one-way ANOVAs for continuous variables and Pearson chi-squared tests for categorical variables. These analyses revealed a group difference in age (with AD participants being older than intact or MCI participants), and a trend toward a difference in education (higher among intact than MCI participants; see Table 1). As such, group differences in overall RBANS performance at the Index score level, amyloid plaque deposition, and hippocampal volumes were examined via ANCOVAs which controlled for the influence of age and education. Group differences in APOE status were assessed via a logistic regression analysis that controlled for these same variables. We also controlled for the influence of age and education in ANCOVAs testing for group differences in performance on all RBANS memory variables (from both the original List Recall and Recognition, and Story and Figure Recall subtests; plus the novel Story and Figure Recognition subtest variables).

To assess the primary aims of the study, we conducted partial Pearson’s correlations (controlling for age and education) of the associations between all RBANS memory variables with the continuous biomarkers of global amyloid plaque deposition and total hippocampal volumes. Point bi-serial correlations are a special case of Pearson’s r, which was used to examine correlations involving the dichotomous variable of APOE ε4 status. Given the large number of statistical tests, multiple comparisons were controlled for in all primary analyses of correlations and post-hoc tests via the false-discovery rate (FDR) procedure (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995).

To explore the relative strength of associations between RBANS recall and recognition indices and biomarkers, we also compared the correlations for the core recall and recognition measures of interest via the test of the difference between dependent correlations with one variable in common (Lee &amp; Preacher, 2013). These analyses used the standard bivariate correlations for the relevant variables. Finally, to begin clarifying the relations between RBANS memory test performance and AD biomarkers in healthy aging and within the different levels of AD severity, we also conducted secondary analyses of the within-group associations between all RBANS memory variables and AD biomarkers. Given the limited size of each sample and the need to preserve degrees of freedom, these analyses also employed bivariate rather than partial correlations. For all analyses, we used the maximum sample size available. Out of the full sample of N = 154, one participant was missing data for List Recognition hits and false positives, three participants were missing data for amyloid deposition and APOE status, and nine participants were missing data from the novel Story and Figure Recognition subtests (in addition to those missing hippocampal volumes). The respective sample sizes for each analysis are indicated in the tables below.

Results

Preliminary Analyses

As indicated in Table 1, the groups differed with respect to age (F(2,154) = 6.62, p = . 002), such that individuals with AD were, on average, three years older than those with MCI (p = .013) and approximately four years older than intact participants (p &lt; .001), while intact and MCI participants did not differ from one another (p = .372). The sample was relatively highly educated as a whole (mean years education = 16.06). Although the groups did not statistically differ with regard to level of education, intact participants had more years of education on average (F(2, 154) = 3.02, p = .052), especially relative to MCI participants. The groups did not differ with regard to sex, race, or ethnicity (all p-values &gt; .30). In terms of overall performance on the RBANS, the groups differed in the expected fashion across the five primary Index scores of Immediate Memory, Visuospatial/Constructional, Language, Attention, and Delayed Memory, as well as the Total Score (see Table 1). With the exception of the Visuospatial/Constructional Index, on which MCI and AD participants performed comparably (p = .14), pairwise comparisons indicated that intact participants consistently outperformed participants with MCI, who consistently outperformed participants with AD (all p-values &lt; .02, uncorrected).

As shown in Table 2, the groups differed across all of the memory subscales of the RBANS, including both the original and the newly developed recognition memory indices (all p-values &lt; .001). All but two pairwise comparisons were significant at p = .029 or lower (FDR-corrected), with the exceptions being comparisons between MCI and AD participants on List Recall scores and Figure Recognition hits. Likewise, the groups differed significantly across all three biomarkers (Table 1). Beginning with global amyloid plaque levels (F(4,151) = 60.93, p &lt; . 001), participants with MCI and AD had higher levels of brain amyloid than cognitively intact individuals (both p &lt; .001), but did not differ from one another (p = .995). The same was true of hippocampal volumes (F(4, 134) = 21.24, p &lt; . 001), such that intact participants had larger volumes than individuals with either MCI or AD (p &lt; .001), who did not differ from each other (p = .15). For APOE status, the groups also differed (Χ2 (4) = 31.48, p &lt; .001), such that there were fewer APOE ε4 positive individuals in the intact group than either the MCI or AD groups (p &lt;. 001), while the MCI and AD groups again did not differ from each other (p = .253). A separate set of ANCOVA’s controlling for participants’ number of ε4 alleles (not shown) confirmed that the small number of homozygotes in the sample were not driving these effects (n = 14 participants in total; 8 AD, 5 MCI, and 1 intact).

Primary Analyses

Turning to the principle study question, correlation analyses revealed significant associations across nearly all pairwise comparisons of AD biomarkers and recognition memory indices, with the two exceptions of Story and Figure Recognition Hits and APOE status (see Table 3). Of note, 30 out of the 36 correlations assessed remained significant at p &lt; .001 (FDR-corrected), indicating robust relationships between memory scores and biomarkers in the present sample. In general, relationships tended to be strongest for associations with amyloid plaque deposition and hippocampal volume relative to APOE status, and for recall and recognition total scores relative to correlations with recognition hits and false positives.

In examining average correlations across recall and recognition scores (respectively), and across the three biomarkers, Recall and Recognition total scores showed comparable relationships with biomarkers (average r = ± .48 for Recall, r = ± .42 for Recognition total scores), though average correlations across the three biomarkers were smaller for Recognition hits (average r = ± .28) and false positives (average r = ± .38). To better quantify the difference between recall and recognition total scores, the test of the difference between dependent correlations was then calculated for these measures (based on the standard bivariate correlations), for each of the three types of memory stimulus material (List, Story, Figure). As shown in Table 4, correlations with the three biomarkers did not significantly differ for List and Story material (though the relation between Story Recall and amyloid plaque deposition levels would exceed that for Story Recognition using a one-tailed test; p = .035). Relations between biomarker and figure memory performance behaved somewhat differently, demonstrating stronger relations between Figure Recall and amyloid levels and hippocampal volumes than those obtained for Figure Recognition. In examining average (unsigned) correlations across memory scales in each of the three biomarkers separately, effects were numerically largest for amyloid plaque levels (average r = ± .44), followed by hippocampal volumes (average r = ± .40) and APOE status (average r = ± .33). Formal tests of these differences in the bivariate correlations via the test of dependent correlations with one variable in common were not significant (range of z-scores: 0.27-1.39, range of p-values: 0.78-0.17).

Secondary Analyses

Finally, to begin clarifying patterns of associations between RBANS memory subtest scores and common AD biomarkers across the continuum of AD severity, we repeated the above correlations, but examined them separately within each group. The results are shown in Table 5. In contrast to the results in the full sample, most associations were small and not significant (uncorrected). The exceptions included a negative relationship between List Recall scores and amyloid levels in AD participants (r(34) = −.42, p &lt; .05), a negative correlation between Story Recognition total scores and APOE status in MCI (r(35) = −.33, p &lt;. 05), a positive correlation between Story Recognition false positive errors and APOE status in MCI (r(35) = .49, p &lt;. 01), and a positive relationship between List Recognition false positive errors and global amyloid plaque deposition in MCI (r(35) = .33, p &lt; .05). Insofar as each of the three groups exhibited a positive correlation of a similar size between List Recognition false positives and amyloid plaque levels, this latter effect appears to be among the more consistent effects across the three groups.

Discussion

This study sought to evaluate associations between two recently-developed recognition subtests for the RBANS (Story Recognition and Figure Recognition) and common AD biomarkers in the form of global brain amyloid plaque deposition, bilateral hippocampal volumes, and APOE ε4 allele carrier status, across the spectrum of AD severity. Consistent with prior studies using a smaller sample of this same cohort (Duff, Suhrie, Dalley, et al., 2021; Duff, Suhrie, Hammers, et al., 2021), the three groups differed in the expected direction on most RBANS scores and biomarkers.

On the main study question of the relationship of RBANS memory subtests to AD biomarkers, correlation analyses in the full sample indicated significant associations between nearly all RBANS memory subtests and the three biomarkers. Thus, the findings were consistent with hypotheses, and previous results from the earlier, smaller sub-sample from this dataset (Duff, Suhrie, Hammers, et al., 2021), indicating inverse relationships between memory performance amyloid plaque deposition levels and APOE status, and positive relations with hippocampal volumes. Recall and recognition total scores tended to show the strongest relations to biomarkers relative to recognition hits and false positives. When associations with these two types of memory tasks were explicitly compared, recognition and recall measures showed comparably-sized relations to all three biomarkers for the list material, and to hippocampal volumes and APOE status for the story information. Story Recall scores tended to be related more strongly to amyloid plaque deposition levels than Story Recognition total scores. In contrast, Figure Recall scores showed significantly stronger associations to amyloid plaque levels and hippocampal volumes than Figure Recognition total scores, although the two were comparable in terms of their relations to APOE status. When correlations were averaged across memory subscales within each individual biomarker, associations tended to be strongest for amyloid plaque levels and hippocampal volumes, followed by APOE status.

In examining patterns of associations within each type of stimulus material, Table 3 suggests that recognition total and recall scores often showed comparably-sized relations to biomarkers, at least for list and story material. For example, for list information, correlations were comparable across the three biomarkers, as well as for correlations with hippocampal volumes for story information. Recognition false positives also showed comparably-sized effects to that of recall and recognition total scores in several instances, as evidenced by similar effect sizes for correlations between amyloid plaque and APOE status and list information, and for APOE status and story information. As noted in the Introduction, the presence of relatively strong effects for recognition false positives may be attributable to the tendency of individuals with amnestic MCI and AD to produce an elevated number of false positives (Delis et al., 1991; Hildebrandt et al., 2009), thereby driving the associations with biomarkers.

In contrast, recognition hits typically showed the lowest associations with biomarkers across memory subscales. This may reflect the same processes as those responsible for the relative sensitivity of false positive errors, albeit with a different psychometric impact. That is, because individuals with MCI and AD exhibit a “yea-saying” bias during recognition testing (Brandt et al., 1992; Delis et al., 1991; Hildebrandt et al., 2009), this will decrease between-subject variability in hits in the sample as a whole, while still differentiating groups on false positives. Associations between Story Recognition hits and hippocampal volumes may be something of an exception in this respect, possibly reflecting the increased contextual structure afforded by the Story Memory task, which may depend to a greater degree on associative functions supported by medial temporal lobe structures (Manns et al., 2003; Stark &amp; Squire, 2001). Finally, Figure Recognition measures represented an exception to the overall pattern of results, generally showing smaller relations to biomarkers than recall scores. Potential explanations for this include the lower reliability of this measure relative to the other recognition subscales (Duff, Suhrie, Dalley, et al., 2021), and perhaps also greater demands on executive functions during the (incidental) encoding during Figure Recall (e.g., akin to the Rey Complex Figure Test; Somerville et al., 2000; Stern et al., 1994), relative to List Learning and Story Memory.

Results for the within-group correlations with biomarkers diverged from those in the full sample in generally being weaker and non-significant. Such a pattern is to be expected given the smaller size of each sub-sample, and their lower within-group variability, both of which likely reduced statistical power to detect those effects. As such, the associations that were observed should be considered preliminary and bear replication in follow-up studies. Perhaps the most consistent of these was the positive association between amyloid plaque levels and List Recognition false positives, which reached significance (uncorrected) in MCI participants, but was nevertheless in the same direction and of a similar size in intact and AD participants. Other effects that bear further investigation from the within-group analyses include the inverse relation between amyloid plaque and List Recall scores in AD, and the relations between APOE status and Story Recognition total scores and between APOE and Story Recognition false positives in MCI.

Stepping back, the present results are highly consistent with the broader literature on biomarker correlates of memory functioning in AD, in confirming the inverse relations between RBANS memory performance and amyloid levels and APOE status, and positive relations with hippocampal volumes (Duff, Suhrie, Hammers, et al., 2021; England et al., 2014; Ottoy et al., 2019; Teng et al., 2019). The present findings extend those previous studies by comprehensively examining the sensitivity of the RBANS memory subtests and their derived measures to common AD biomarkers, including the novel Story and Figure Recognition tasks. The overall findings of robust and typically moderate-to-large associations between amyloid plaque levels, hippocampal volumes, the number of APOE ε4 alleles, and RBANS recall and recognition memory indices supports their broader application in research and clinical practice.

Of particular relevance to this special issue, are the recent studies showing the utility of recognition memory indices in predicting conversion from amnestic MCI to AD (De Simone et al., 2019; Russo et al., 2017), in differentiating individuals with MCI who do and do not have biomarker evidence of incipient AD (Goldstein et al., 2019), and in distinguishing AD from other dementias (e.g., behavioral variant FTD; van den Berg et al., 2020). As such, the present results support use of the original and novel RBANS memory scales in research aimed identifying individuals at-risk for development of AD. For example, it may be possible to develop regression equations to predict individual patients’ biomarker profiles on the basis of their RBANS memory performance. Such algorithms could be important for improving screening and study outcomes in clinical trials for AD, and potentially ultimately in clinical practice. Finally, the present results also support further study into the properties and clinical utility of the RBANS Story and Figure Recognition memory indices in non-AD populations, such as subcortical dementias, traumatic brain injury, autoimmune conditions, and others.

There are a number of limitations of the current study that should also be noted. First, although the overall sample is relatively large for a study of its kind, some analyses were limited due to missing data for some subtests or biomarker variables. This is especially challenging in relation to the MRI data that could not be included for some MCI and AD patients due to excessive cerebral volume loss and/or excessive head movement during MRI scanning. Unfortunately, this may have biased estimates for some correlations with hippocampal volumes, and specifically in the direction of underestimating those effects. That is, because participants with poor volume segmentations had to be specifically excluded from those analyses for quality control, the remaining sample may be less representative of the general population of MCI and AD individuals with regard to hippocampal volumes. The second main limitation of the study is the limited demographic diversity of the current sample, which may hinder the generalizability of the results to the broader population of older adults. Participants in the present study were generally college-educated and almost exclusively white, non-Hispanic older adults. As is becoming increasingly recognized, in order to reduce health disparities in AD diagnosis and care, it is crucial to improve recruitment and retention of ethnic and racial minority individuals and other historically-underrepresented groups in AD research (Gilmore-Bykovskyi et al., 2019). Finally, although the present study provided a unique opportunity to examine correlations between a novel set of RBANS memory scales and well-established AD biomarkers, additional work is necessary to characterize the relations of these scales to other biomarkers, such as sub-regional amyloid plaque deposition values (e.g., in medial temporal cortex), and global and regional measures of tau-based radiotracers. Notwithstanding these limitations, the present findings provide clear evidence for the sensitivity of the RBANS memory scales and novel recognition measures to AD biomarkers, supporting their use in future AD research and practice.

1 Although the cortical-subcortical distinction among dementia syndromes continues to be useful clinically and pedagogically in neuropsychology (Lezak et al., 2012; D. Loring, 2015; Smith &amp; Butts, 2018), in actuality, contemporary neuroimaging studies have established the involvement of large-scale brain networks in most neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., see: Badhwar et al., 2017; Gratwicke et al., 2015; Tartaglia et al., 2011; Teipel et al., 2016).
