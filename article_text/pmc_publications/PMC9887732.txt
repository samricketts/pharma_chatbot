Herein, we report a new series of divalent 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole bifunctional chelators (BFCs) with high affinity for amyloid β aggregates and favorable lipophilicity for blood–brain barrier penetration. The addition of an alkyl carboxylate ester pendant arm offers high binding affinity toward Cu(II). The novel BFCs form stable 64Cu-radiolabeled complexes and exhibit promising partition coefficient (logD) values of 1.05–1.85. Among the five compounds tested, the 64Cu-YW-15 complex exhibits significant staining of amyloid β plaques in ex vivo autoradiography studies. In addition, biodistribution studies show that 64Cu-YW-15-Me exhibits moderate brain uptake (0.69 ± 0.08 %ID/g) in wild type mice.

Graphical Abstract


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. The formation of extracellular amyloid plaques in the brain, caused by accumulation of misfolded amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, is a primary hallmark of AD progression.1–4 As a characteristic biomarker of AD, amyloid plaques have been used as a standard diagnostic target for decades. Effective measurement of amyloid plaque burden in patient brains could be an asset for early diagnosis of AD.5–7

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging technique that allows for noninvasive evaluation of amyloid plaque burden in the brain by utilizing imaging agents that contain positron-emitting radioisotopes.6,8 Amyloid imaging probes that utilize short lived radionuclides such as 11C (t1/2 = 20 min) and 18F (t1/2 = 110 min) including 18F-florbetaben have been investigated extensively and applied in the clinic.9–14 However, these radioisotopes are attached to target agents via covalent bonding, which normally requires special reaction conditions and equipment.15 Incorporating a radiometal rapidly into an imaging agent can be a convenient alternative. Several high-affinity ligands such as diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone (ATSM), 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodo-decane (cyclen), and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives have been developed as molecular imaging agents that utilize radiotracers such as 64Cu (t1/2 = 12.7 h).16–20

Our research group has previously reported TACN-based Aβ-targeting bifunctional chelators (BFCs) for potential 64Cu PET imaging applications21–27 and recently for 68Ga PET imaging of Aβ deposits on blood vessels in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).28 We have reported 64Cu complexes with moderate to good blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability over 1 %ID/g,22,23 in comparison to 4.77 %ID/g that was measured for FDA-approved radiotracer 18F-florbetaben.14 These BFCs and their Cu complexes have shown midnanomolar affinity for amyloid plaques,22,24,25 in comparison to the 6.7 nM Ki of 18F-florbetaben.14 We have also previously reported BFCs with high stability constants for their Cu complexes, approaching values similar to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA),21,26,27,29 thus indicating that the class of TACN-based BFCs is promising in the development of 64Cu PET imaging agents for AD.

Despite the promise of these complexes, further optimization of at least one of the three properties described above is required for each ligand system prior to further investigation. We consider that careful optimization of the previously developed BFCs can have major impacts on their properties. A broad comparison of how specific structural changes aimed at optimizing a single property impacts the other properties would serve as a guide for ligand optimization in the future.

Herein, we report a series of BFCs containing two Aβ-targeting fragments and a TACN macrocyclic ligand, along with novel derivatives containing carboxylate ester arms to increase their lipophilicity and improve BBB permeability.30 In addition, the BFCs YW-15 and YW-18 are analyzed for the first time as ligands of copper for the labeling of amyloid plaques, which is different than their utilization as 68Ga ligands to image CAA.28 Along with the previously reported TACN-based ligands,26–28 the analysis of the current BFCs provides a deeper understanding of the impact of ligand structural modifications onto the changes in amyloid affinity, lipophilicity, metal complex stability, biodistribution profile, and ultimately in vivo applications.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Design and Synthesis of BFCs.

The BFCs discussed herein were generated using a synthetic route based on a Mannich reaction between 2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-benzothiazole and TACN in the presence of paraformaldehyde (Figure 1). A second identical Aβ-binding fragment was added to the BFC framework to improve the affinity for the amyloid plaques. In BFCs YW-15-Me and YW-15-iPr, alkyl substituents were added to the TACN backbone, in contrast to the parent secondary amine derivative YW-15,28 while in BFCs YW-18-Me and YW-18-tBu, a pendant carboxylate arm was added via reactions with methyl and tert-butyl bromoacetate, respectively, to increase the metal chelation ability of the corresponding BFC. Hydrolysis of YW-18-tBu in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid generates YW-18, a carboxylic acid-containing BFC that should act as the strongest metal chelator among this series. Relevant to this work, BFCs YW-15 and YW-18 have recently been employed by our groups in the development of 68Ga complexes for potential PET imaging of amyloid plaques deposited to blood vessels in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).28

Fluorescence Imaging of Amyloid Plaques in 5xFAD Mouse Brain Sections.

Ex vivo staining and imaging of 5xFAD mouse brain sections was conducted to evaluate the affinity of the BFCs toward Aβ species. Brain sections were collected from 9 to 11 month old 5xFAD mice, which have developed amyloid pathology found in AD.31,32 An appreciable amount of fluorescence staining was observed upon incubation of the brain sections for 30 min with 50 μM solutions of BFCs and Cu(II) complexes, as demonstrated by the fluorescence images of YW-15-Me and YW-18-Me (Figure 2). The specific staining of amyloid plaques was confirmed by staining with 2 μM Congo Red (CR), a commonly used amyloid-binding fluorescent dye (Figure 2).33,34 Fluorescence images of YW-15,28 YW-15-iPr, and YW-18 also show that these BFCs specifically bind to amyloid plaques by co-staining with Congo Red and a significant degree of fluorescence colocalization (Figure S3).

To confirm the specific staining of Aβ plaques by BFCs and their Cu(II) complexes, the fluorescent dye AF 594-labeled antibody HJ3.4 was utilized for staining. This AF594-conjugated HJ3.4 antibody (AF594-HJ3.4) could bind to a wide range of Aβ species.23,35–39 Solutions of 50 μM of BFCs and their Cu(II) complexes were used to treat 6 to 11 month old 5xFAD mouse brain sections. A heavy load of Aβ-plaque emission signal by AF594-HJ3.4 showed favorable colocalization with the BFCs and their Cu(II) complexes, as suggested by the calculated Pearson’s coefficients. An especially favorable colocalization was observed for BFCs YW-15-Me and YW-18-Me and their Cu(II) complexes (Figure 3), while a slightly reduced colocalization was observed for BFCs YW-15-iPr and YW-18-tBu (Figure S4). The extent of colocalization for AF594-HJ3.4 antibody is greater than that for CR, indicating that these BFCs bind to a wide range of soluble and insoluble Aβ species.

Quantification of BFC Affinity for Amyloid Plaques.

Thioflavin T (ThT) competition assays were utilized to determine the binding affinity of the BFCs containing two amyloid-targeting fragments toward synthetic amyloid plaques (Figure S5). An increase in fluorescence at 485 nm following excitation at 435 nm corresponds to increased concentration of ThT-associated amyloid plaques; decreased fluorescence indicates an increase in ligand association with amyloid plaques, from which the ThT has been displaced. YW-15, YW-18, and YW-18-Me were observed to have Ki values in the mid nM range at 290, 550, and 860 nM, respectively. YW-15-Me and YW-15-iPr were observed to have Ki values in the low μM range, both at 1.3 μM (Table 1). Overall, the ligands have moderate to high affinity for amyloid plaques, indicating potential for use as amyloid PET tracers.

Determination of Lipophilicity by LogD.

LogD values were measured to predict the blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability of BFCs. The determination of logD values of BFCs was conducted by fluorescence intensity measurement using conditions described in the experimental section (see Supporting Information). All BFCs other than YW-18 have logD values around or over 1.2 (Table 2), suggesting that these compounds have the potential to penetrate the BBB.40,41 A lower logD was obtained for the carboxylic acid YW-18, due to its increased hydrophilicity. Finally, since YW-18-tBu does not exhibit a higher logD value than YW-18-Me and its molecular weight is higher, the YW-18-tBu BFC was not used in any subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies.

Stability Constants with Metal Ions by pH-Spectrophotometric Titration.

The presence of several acidic and basic functional groups in each BFC prompted the determination of their acidity constants (pKa) by UV–vis spectrophotometric titrations. Titration of YW-15 from pH 3 to 11 revealed several changes in the spectrum, including the disappearance of a 325 nm band and the appearance of a 375 nm shoulder with an isosbestic point at 350 nm (Figure 4). As the pH of the solution decreases, the 325 nm band continues to disappear with a shifted isosbestic point at 333 nm until the λmax of the spectrum shifts to a 362 nm band at high pH. Titration of YW-18 from pH 3 to 11 revealed similar changes in the spectrum with several notable differences (Figure 4). The titration initially revealed a very similar disappearance of a 325 nm band, with a 360 nm shoulder appearing and isosbestic point at 350 nm. As the solution becomes more basic, the shoulder at 375 nm disappears, while the 325 nm band remains steady until the shoulder has disappeared. The 325 nm band gradually shifts to a new λmax of 360 nm, where the band stabilizes at high pH. Titrations of YW-15-Me, YW-15-iPr, and YW-18-Me were conducted from pH 3 to 11 and revealed similar changes in the spectrum (Figure S7). The best fit of the data revealed 4 pKa values for each ligand (Table 3), calculated by HypSpec (Protonic Software, UK) and confirmed by monitoring changes in wavelengths of known species as a function of pH. Based on previously reported acidity constants for phenols and amines, pKa1–3 were assigned to deprotonation of the TACN amine groups, and pKa4 was assigned to deprotonation of the phenol.21,29 Acidity constants for the thiazole and carboxylic acid were not determined; these groups are expected to be acidic, and therefore the acidity constants are likely located outside the pH range of the performed titrations. Species distribution plots (Figure 4) were created based the calculated pKa values to show the % formation of each species of the ligand.

Quantification of the metal chelation ability of the BFCs was performed by spectrophotometric titration of the ligands in the presence of equimolar amounts of Cu(II). Titration of YW-15 pre-mixed with Cu(II) from pH 3 to 11 exhibits a gradual decrease in the 325 nm peak, which gradually stabilizes at an absorbance of approximately 0.25, before gradually shifting to a new λmax of 345 nm, where the peak stabilizes at high pH (Figure 5). Titration of YW-18 in the presence of an equimolar amount of Cu(II) from pH 3 to 11 exhibits a gradual decrease in a 325 nm peak and appearance of a 420 nm shoulder with an isosbestic point at 350 nm. As the solution becomes more basic, the λmax of the 325 nm peak gradually shifts to 375 nm, where the absorbance continues to decrease before stabilizing at high pH (Figure 5). Titrations of Cu-YW-15-Me, Cu-YW-15-iPr, and Cu-YW-18-Me reveal similar trends as observed in Cu-YW-15 (Figure S8). The best fit of the data revealed 2logK values for each ligand (Table 4), calculated by HypSpec (Protonic Software, UK) and confirmed by monitoring changes in wavelengths of known species as a function of pH.

The calculated stability constants reveal that the Cu(II) complex of monoprotonated YW-18 is approximately six orders of magnitude more stable than that of YW-15 (Table 4). We expect this is due to the presence of an additional metal-chelation carboxylate arm. Excitingly, the calculated stability constants of the complexes reveal similar stability to complexes known to have high copper affinity such as H3nota and the previously published 64Cu-based multifunctional complex CuL,1 which contains an ATSM ligand fragment (Table 4).29,42 By comparison, YW-15-iPr exhibits a more complicated speciation than the other BFCs, as the Jobs plot reveals the likely formation of a 2:1 ligand:Cu2+ complex (Figure S6). An additional titration of YW-15-iPr was conducted with a ratio of 2:1 ligand:Cu2+ (Figure S9), and the stability constants obtained from this titration indicate the presence of a CuL2 complex (Table S1), thus confirming that the aqueous coordination chemistry of YW-15-iPr is more complicated than for the other BFCs.43

Due to the presence of multiple Cu:L complexes present at physiological pH (Figure 5), an alternative method was employed to compare the chelating ability of the BFCs described herein. The pCu (pCu = −log[Cufree]) of each complex at a given pH allows for comparison of the amount of noncoordinated copper (Cufree) present in solution, where higher pCu values indicate lower concentrations of Cufree and therefore more copper coordinated by the BFCs and a higher Cu-BFC complex stability. Overall, the YW-18-based ligands have higher pCu values, closer to reported values of H3nota, and therefore higher Cu-BFC complex stability at neutral pHs than the YW-15-based ligands was expected based on the YW-18-based ligands containing an additional metal-chelating arm (Table 5).

Antioxidant Capacity of BFCs.

The Cu2+-induced antioxidant capacity (CIAC) assays were conducted to probe whether the BFCs described herein can control the undesired property of Cu2+ ions to promote a radical reaction under reducing conditions.25,43 CIAC assays measure radical formation by monitoring the presence of ascorbate in solution following addition of an oxidizing agent. Utilization of this assay with Cu2+ as an oxidizing agent gives insight into stability and redox potential of the complexes by measuring the consumption by oxidation of ascorbate. Smaller amounts of ascorbate consumption indicate that complexation has shifted the redox potential of the Cu2+, preventing the metal from oxidizing ascorbate. Ascorbate remaining in solution also indicates the stability of the complex, preventing the Cu2+ from returning to solution and oxidizing ascorbate. Each ligand studied indicated some ability to prevent radical formation, with ligands YW-15, YW-15-Me, YW-18, and YW-18-Me showing greater than 90% ascorbate remaining in solution after 20 min (Figure 6). By comparison, YW-15-iPr showed a lesser ability to prevent radical formation at higher concentrations, with approximately 60% of ascorbate remaining in solution after 20 min. At lower concentrations, the antioxidant capacity of the ligands is significantly reduced, with less than 20% of ascorbate remaining in solution after 20 min for all ligands. These results indicate that ligand YW-15-iPr has the lowest ability to prevent Cu2+-induced oxidative stress when complexed with Cu(II), suggesting poor potential for use as a PET tracer. However, the ability of other ligands tested to prevent the inducement of such oxidative stress indicates that they should not be eliminated from consideration as 64Cu-based PET tracers.

EPR Spectra of Copper Complexes.

To further characterize the Cu-BFC complexes, their X-band EPR spectra were recorded in frozen glasses at 77 K. The Cu2+ complexes were prepared immediately before the EPR experiment by reacting ligand with 0.8 equiv CuCl2. The EPR spectrum of Cu-YW-15-Me in a 1:3 (v:v) MeCN:PrCN glass reveals a pseudoaxial pattern with three different g values: gz = 2.240, Az(Cu) = 162 G, gy = 2.057, and gx = 2.032 (Figure 7). The EPR spectra of Cu-YW-15, Cu-YW-15-iPr, Cu-YW-18, Cu-YW-18-Me, and Cu-YW-18-tBu were obtained the same way and exhibit similar EPR patterns as Cu-YW-15-Me (Table 6, Figure S11).43 Each complex exhibits an EPR pattern characteristic of a mononuclear Cu2+ complex, indicating the stability and inaptitude toward dimerization of these Cu complexes in solution.

Radiolabeling of BFCs.

The radiolabeling of compounds YW-15, YW-15-Me, YW-18, and YW-18-tBu was performed using 64CuCl2 and employing conditions described in the Supporting Information. The BFCs were readily labeled with 64Cu under mild conditions. Quality control assays were conducted using HPLC and/or TLC; HPLC retention times were observed in the range of 10.5–11.2 min for the 64Cu-radiolabeled complexes (Figure S13). All radiochemical purities were &gt;95% within minutes at 95 °C, with specific activities of 100 Ci/mmol or greater. Therefore, all radiolabeled complexes were used directly without further purification.

One important factor of diagnostic agents for AD is the ability to penetrate the BBB. The octanol/PBS partition coefficient values logD were determined for 64Cu-radiolabeled BFCs (Table 7). A decreasing trend of logD values with less bulky alkyl groups was observed. Gratifyingly, the obtained logD values for 64Cu-radiolabeled complexes, with the exception of YW-15-iPr, are promising, in the range of 1.29–1.85, which suggests their potential ability to cross the BBB via passive diffusion.41 Interestingly, the 64Cu complex of YW-18, which contains two phenol groups and one carboxylic acid group, has a positive logD value of 1.34 ± 0.03 and thus is likely to cross the BBB. The hydrophilicity of the carboxylic acid group is normally not favorable for BBB permeability, yet in this case, we propose that solution one of the two phenol groups is deprotonated to become a phenolate, forming a neutral Cu(II) complex along with the carboxylic acid group in YW-18 and therefore is beneficial for BBB penetration. Interestingly, this correlates well with the logD values of 1.24 and 1.66 obtained for the 68Ga(III) complexes of YW-15 and YW-18, respectively,28 vs the values of 1.43 and 1.34 for the corresponding 64Cu(II) complexes reported herein (Table 7), further supporting that the phenol groups could become deprotonated to accommodate that charge of the chelated metal ion and thus lead to lipophilic metal complexes that have the potential to cross the BBB, especially for the dicationic 64Cu(II) ion.

For all BFCs other than YW-15-iPr, the logD values of the complexes were observed to be greater than the logD of the BFC itself. While the molecular weights of the ligands are greater than those of the BFCs and higher than optimal molecular weight ranges for BBB permeability, previously reported ligands with similar molecular weights have exhibited good BBB permeability.22,23 We propose that the logD of the Cu-YW-15-iPr complex is lower than the logD of the ligand due to a more complex species distribution, as shown above for the species distribution titrations. Additionally, the logD of the Cu-YW-18-tBu complex was observed to be only marginally higher than that of the Cu-YW-18-Me complex, and thus it was not employed in subsequent biodistribution studies.

Overall, all the tested BFCs have desirable logD values (ideally larger than 1), and thus we proceeded with their further characterization, including autoradiography and biodistribution studies.

Autoradiography Studies.

Ex vivo autoradiography studies using brain sections from 11 month old 5xFAD and aged-matched WT mice were conducted to determine the specific binding of the 64Cu-labeled BFCs to the amyloid plaques. The brain sections were stained, washed, and imaged as described in the Supporting Information. Unfortunately, YW-15-Me and YW-18-tBu exhibit appreciable background intensity (Figure 8A, first row and Figure 8B, red), indicating nonspecific binding. In the case of 5xFAD mouse brain sections, we observed an increased autoradiography intensity for all complexes (Figure 8A, second row and Figure 8B, blue), with YW-18-tBu exhibiting the highest overall intensity, while YW-15, YW-18, and YW-18-Me exhibit the largest fold increase (~4) for 5xFAD vs WT brain sections (Figure 8B).

The specific binding to amyloid plaques of the radiolabeled BFCs was further confirmed by blocking the brain sections with a nonradioactive blocking agent B1 (Figure S14), and a remarkable decrease in autoradiography intensity was observed (Figure 8A, third row and Figure 8B, green).

Biodistribution Studies.

Encouraged by the promising in vitro studies, in vivo biodistribution experiments were performed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of 64Cu-radiolabeled BFCs, using normal CD-1 and Tg2576 mice as described in the Supporting Information. The retention and accumulation of the 64Cu-radiolabeled YW-15, YW-15-Me, and YW-18 complexes in selected organs of CD-1 mice were evaluated at 2, 60, and 240 min after tracer administration (Figure 9, Table 8). Ligands YW-15, YW-15-Me, and YW-18 were chosen for biodistribution studies to assess how changes to the ligand N-substituent impact the in vivo properties of the corresponding complexes. In WT mice, YW-15, YW-15-Me, and YW-18 showed moderate brain uptake at 2 min post-injection, followed by rapid washout. (Figure 9, Table 8). 64Cu-YW-15 showed a brain uptake of 0.26 ± 0.13% ID/g at 2 min post-injection, which dropped to ~0.04 ± 0.01 %ID/g at 60 and 240 min post-injection, 64Cu-YW-15-Me showed the brain uptake of 0.47 ± 0.12 %ID/g at 2 min post-injection which dropped to ~0.15 %ID/g 60 and 240 min post-injection, and 64Cu-YW-18 showed brain uptake of 0.33 ± 0.12 %ID/g at 2 min post-injection, which then dropped to ~0.01% ID/g at 60 and 240 min post-injection (Figure 9, Table 8). Interestingly, 64Cu-YW-15-Me has the highest %ID/g in the brain at each time point, although it has neither the lowest nor the highest molecular weight of the three similarly lipophilic complexes studied. This indicates factors outside lipophilicity and molecular weight impact the biodistribution profile of these complexes. The brain to blood ratio results (Figure 10) suggest that the retention of 64Cu complexes in the brain slightly increases with time, possibly due to their favorable lipophilicity.

Overall, these biodistribution studies suggest that the 64Cu-radiolabeled TACN-based complexes can cross the BBB and thus could serve as a PET imaging agents for detecting Aβ plaque burden in vivo following further optimization of blood–brain-barrier permeability. Importantly, the rapid clearance from the brain of WT mice indicate that this radiolabeled BFC does not release 64Cu ions in the brain to an appreciable extent and thus should not lead to a significant background PET signal in healthy controls.

CONCLUSIONS

Reported herein is a series of bifunctional chelators (BFCs) consisting of two Aβ-binding fragments and a TACN metal-chelating fragment. These BFCs exhibit remarkable labeling of Aβ species in ex vivo 5xFAD mouse brain section staining. Interestingly, in comparison with the previously published BFCs, the inclusion of an additional Aβ-binding fragment has minimal impact on the binding affinity toward Aβ plaques, which remained in the 100 nM range.26 For comparison, the Ki of 18F-Florbetaben, an FDA-approved PET imaging agent used in AD diagnosis, is 6.7 nM,14 indicating that further optimization of the amyloid-targeting fragment of these complexes would be beneficial. While the inclusion of additional Aβ-binding fragments did not increase the affinity for Aβ plaques as anticipated, a desirable impact of increased BFC lipophilicity was observed, making them more favorable for BBB penetration. The increased lipophilicity is maintained for the corresponding 64Cu complexes, which have slightly higher logD values than previously published complexes with one Aβ-binding fragment and one carboxylate ester arm26 and significantly higher logD values than previously published complexes with one Aβ-binding fragment and two carboxylate ester arms.27

The BFCs were additionally modified by incorporation of N-alkyl or N-carboxylate methyl ester arms on the TACN backbone. Changes of the N-alkyl substituent from hydrogen to methyl to isopropyl decreased the logD of the overall complexes, likely due to the bulky alkyl substituents interfering with ability of the phenols to be involved in coordination to the Cu center. This indicates that inclusion of larger alkyl groups has little to no benefit on the lipophilicity of these complexes, while alkyl groups larger than methyl may not be beneficial due to the detrimental effect on Cu2+ binding affinity. In addition, a minimal benefit to the lipophilicity of the complexes was observed upon changes to the N-methyl ester substituents, while negative impacts on the Cu2+ complex stability of the BFCs were observed upon alkylation of the carboxylic acid with a methyl or tert-butyl ester group. Interestingly, the pCu values of the alkyl esters were similar to values for the BFCs containing N-alkyl arms. Cu-YW-18 has the highest pCu value of all BFCs described herein, similar pCu values for the previously reported ligand with two carboxylic acids, and closer to the pCu value reported for H3nota, a strong chelator of Cu2+.27,29 Taken together these results indicate that carboxylate ester arms had minimal impact on Cu2+ complex stability, but carboxylic acid substituents increase Cu2+ complex stability. However, the inclusion of more than one carboxylic acid substituent did not further increase the stability of the Cu2+ complex stability. Encouragingly, the Cu2+ complexes of BFCs with carboxylic acid substituents did not show significantly decreased lipophilicity, as assessed by logD or brain uptake in biodistribution studies,27 indicating that their presence does not negatively impact BBB penetrability.

Of the complexes investigated herein, 64Cu-YW-15-Me showed the most promising brain uptake in CD-1 mice, with a maximum %ID/g of 0.47 ± 0.12 at 2 min post-injection and with minor increases in brain/blood ratios from 2 min to 4 h, indicating minimal complex retention in the brain. 64Cu-based imaging agents reported in the literature vary in brain uptake values from approximately 0.3 %ID/g in some cyclen systems to approximately 0.75–2.5 %ID/g in some ATSM systems, with the BFCs described herein more closely resemble the moderate brain uptake of the cyclen systems.20 The BFCs described herein and their 64Cu complexes, when compared to previously published compounds,26,27 point toward the need of further development of TACN-based ligands, with one amyloid-targeting fragment to limit the overall molecular weight, a small N-substituent such as hydrogen or methyl, and a carboxylic acid arm to increase the 64Cu complex stability. This indicates a direction for the optimization of 64Cu-TACN-based ligand to optimize BBB penetrability and increase the affinity for amyloid plaques, prior to use for in vivo PET imaging applications.
