Purpose:

In vivo measurement of the spatial distribution of neurofibrillary tangle pathology is critical for early diagnosis and disease monitoring in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Methods:

Forty-nine participants were scanned with 18F-PI-2620 PET to examine the distribution of this novel PET ligand throughout the course of AD: 36 older healthy controls (HC) (age range 61 to 86), 11 beta-amyloid+ (Aβ+) participants with cognitive impairment (CI; clinical diagnosis of either mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia, age range 57 to 86), and 2 participants with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA, age 66 and 78). Group differences in brain regions relevant in AD (medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral parietal cortex) were examined using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) normalized to the inferior gray matter of the cerebellum.

Results:

SUVRs in target regions were relatively stable 60 to 90 minutes post-injection, with the exception of very high binders who continued to show increases over time. Robust elevations in 18F-PI-2620 were observed between HC and Aβ+ CI across all AD regions. Within the HC group, older age was associated with subtle elevations in target regions. Mildly elevated focal uptake was observed in the anterior temporal pole in one svPPA patient.

Conclusion:

Preliminary results suggest strong differences in the medial temporal lobe and cortical regions known to be impacted in AD using 18F-PI-2620 in patients along the AD trajectory. This work confirms that 18F-PI-2620 holds promise as a tool to visualize Tau aggregations in AD.

neurofibrillary tangles

BACKGROUND

Aggregations of beta-amyloid (Aβ) into extracellular plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau into intracellular neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[1]. The ability to assess Aβ plaques in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) has been available for over a decade, whereas tau PET ligands have become available only recently. 18F-Flortaucipir (previously known as 1SF-T807 and 18F-AV1451) was the first promising tau PET ligand with initial publications beginning in 2013 [2], with recent work showing correspondence between in vivo imaging and postmortem tau aggregations within the same participants [3]. In a short time period, this ligand has been applied widely in research studies, showing robust group differences between older healthy controls and cognitively impaired patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia [4, 5], early signal among older healthy controls (HC) that predicts future memory decline [6–8], and spatial patterns of uptake that align with brain networks selectively impaired in atypical clinical presentations of AD [9].

The ability to measure tau aggregation accurately holds particular promise as a biomarker for AD, given that tau deposits are known to be proximal to clinical deficits [10], and the majority of Aβ induced toxicity is thought to be mediated by tau accumulation [11]. There are currently a handful of promising tau PET ligands under investigation. Although initial work with tau PET has provided important insights into the potential of this tool to improve our understanding of AD and provide a means to assess disease modifying therapies, a number of uncertainties remain such as the degree to which off-target signal contaminates target signal across various tau PET ligands. We therefore applied the novel tau PET tracer 18F-PI-2620 [12, 13] across the spectrum of AD and in older healthy controls. 18F-PI-2620 has shown initial promise in detecting tau aggregates in patients with AD [12, 14, 15], as well as high selectivity for 3R/4R tau aggregates [13]. Die overall goal was to provide a comprehensive overview of the spatial pattern and magnitude of signal with this novel tau ligand in regions relevant to AD.

METHODS

Participants:

Forty-nine participants were recruited into this study and underwent an 18F-PI-2620 Tau PET-MR scan. Older normal controls were recruited through an ongoing study of normal aging (the Stanford Aging and Memory Study, SAMS). SAMS is an NIH-funded imaging-biofluid observational cohort study of normal aging that began enrolling in 2014 (age 60+). All healthy controls (HC) recruited through SAMS were classified as clinically normal at a clinical consensus meeting by a panel of neurologists and neuropsychologists. Patients with cognitive impairment (CI; either a clinical diagnosis of MCI or AD dementia) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) were recruited through the Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) or the Stanford Center for Memory Disorders. All CI patients diagnosed clinically with MCI or AD dementia were confirmed to have biomarker evidence of AD using pre-existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amyloid PET data. To assess global cognition Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was available for all HC, whereas the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was available for all patients with MCI or AD dementia (with the exception of one atypical AD case who was too severe to complete the MoCA, and a MCI case that had MMSE instead of the MoCA).

The study protocol was approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants (or their legal representatives) provided written informed consent.

Data Acquisition

18F-PI-2620 was synthesized at the Stanford Cyclotron facility at the Richard M. Lucas Center for Imaging using a previously published protocol [13]. Precursor was provided by Life Molecular Imaging to make 18F-PI-2620. In brief, 18F-PI-2620 was prepared via a two-step synthetic route including radiofluorination and hydrolysis using an automated radiosynthesis platform (GE TRACERlab FX N). PI-2620 precursor solution (2.0 mg in 0.8 mL anhydrous DMSO) was added into azeotropically dried 18F/K222/K2CO3 complex, heated to 150 °C for 15 min, and the crude product was purified on semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The 18F-PI-2620 fraction was formulated in 0.9% sodium chloride injection (USP) containing no more than 10% ethanol and 10 mg of ascorbic acid. 18F-PI-2620 was obtained with 9.62 ± 3.27% radiochemical yield (decay corrected), 99% radiochemical purity and molar activity of 138.95 ± 68.20 GBq μmol–l. The range of injected activities were 173.54 to 354.02 MBq, and the average injected activity was 204.65 ± 41.80 MBq. The broad range of injected doses reflects a study protocol change (the study began with an injection of 300 MBq, but was decreased to 185 MBq after further data showed that high image quality was maintained with a lower injection of 185 MBq).

PET Scanning was completed at the Richard M. Lucas Center for Imaging, using a simultaneous time-of-flight (TOF) enabled PET/MRI scanner (Signa 3 tesla, GE Healthcare), with high sensitivity (23.3 cps/kBq1). Following a 5-10mCi injection of 18F-PI-2620 into an antecubital vein, all subjects had data collected 60 to 90 minutes post-injection, and 39 of 49 participants had emission data collected at injection (with a break between 30 and 50 minutes post-injection). The 10 subjects missing early dynamic data were all healthy control participants.

PET images were reconstructed using TOF optimized subset expectation maximization (TOF-OSEM) with 3 iterations, 28 subsets and voxel size 2.78x1.17x 1.17mm. Corrections were applied for detector deadtime, scatter, randoms, detector normalization and radioisotope decay. Attenuation correction was performed with zero-TE (ZTE) MR imaging for MR attenuation correction (MRAC), which allows direct visualization of bone within the head [16]. PET data were reconstructed into the following frames: 15 second frames for 0 to 5 minutes post-injection, 1 minute frames for 5 to 30 minutes, and then 5 minute frames for 30-100 minutes post-injection. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were computed by normalizing to participant weight and injected dose.

Image Processing

PET image processing was performed using FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki). Specifically, PET frames were realigned with FSL’s FLIRT, using the 5-minute PET frame closest to the acquisition of the high resolution T1 SPGR as the reference frame (ensuring optimal coregistration between PET and the simultaneously collected structural MRI data). We focused on summed data corresponding to 60 to 90 minutes post-injection, but first examined SUVR values extracted from individual 5-minute frames as a function of post-injection time. We examined regions of interest known to be impacted in the course of AD according to Braak Staging as well as work with other tau PET tracers, which corresponds to the medial temporal lobe (an average across entorhinal, hippocampus, and amygdala), posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral parietal cortex [4, 17]. Voxelwise SUVR data was examined across diagnostic groups at both the group level and also at the individual participant level to enable exploration of patterns of uptake. Group level maps were created by spatially normalizing each participant’s structural MRI scan to the MNI template [18] using a non-linear transformation (FSL FNIRT), and then applying those transformation parameters to the corresponding voxelwise SUVR PET data. Spatially normalized PET data were then averaged within diagnostic group. For examination of individual level voxelwise SUVR PET data, images were displayed in each participant’s native space.

Structural MRI Processing

MRI data was collected simultaneously with the PET data. In the current analysis, we used a high resolution Tl-weighted spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) scan (TR/TE/TI=7.664/3.09/400ms, flip angle=11, 1.2x1.1x1. 1mm) scan to define regions of interest (ROI) in each participant’s native space using the FreeSurfer software packages[19], version 6.0 (http://surfer.nim.mgh.harvard.edu/). In brief, structural images were bias field corrected, intensity normalized, and skull stripped using a watershed algorithm. These images underwent a white matter-based segmentation, grey/white matter and pial surfaces were defined, and topology correction was applied to these reconstructed surfaces. Subcortical and cortical ROIs spanning the entire brain were defined in each subject’s native space. A single trained operator (TT) visually confirmed resulting surface output and made manual edits and/or added control points when ROI mis-labeling occurred. A bilateral gray matter cerebellum ROI from the subcortical aseg FreeSurfer atlas [20] was extracted for each participant and edited manually to remove the superior portion, given known issues with off-target binding in this region (Supplemental Figure 1). The gray matter inferior cerebellum ROI was used as a reference region by normalizing the summed PET data by the mean value in this region. We focused on three bilateral target ROIs from the resulting aseg and aparc atlases [20, 21] defined on each subject’s FreeSurfer processed MRI data: medial temporal lobe (combining entorhinal, hippocampus, and amygdala ROIs); posterior cingulate (isthmus cingulate and posterior cingulate), and lateral parietal cortex (inferior parietal, superior parietal, and supramarginal).

Statistical Analysis

Demographic group differences were examined using Spearman’s Rank correlation coefficients for continuous variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for categorical variables. Diagnostic differences for regional SUVRs were determined with non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, using the contrast of HC versus CI (MCI and AD dementia). Associations between age and regional SUVRs with the HC group was assessed using Spearman’s Rank correlation coefficients.

RESULTS

Participants

Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences in age between HC and CI groups (p=0.87). Three of six AD dementia patients and one of five MCI had atypical clinical presentations consistent with posterior cortical atrophy (N=4), whereas the remaining seven patients with cognitive impairment had amnestic presentations [22]. Given known differences in tau binding magnitude and spatial distribution between amnestic and non-amnestic presentations of AD [9], subsequent analyses displayed the four atypical CI patients separately.

Stability Across Post-injection Window

SUV during the late acquisition period were low in the inferior cerebellum (Figure 1A), did not significantly differ across HC and CI groups when examining 60-90 minutes post-injection (Figure 1B; W = 253, p= 0.17) and did not show significant correlations with age within the HC group (Figure 1C; rho=0.02, p=0.90). This pattern suggests this region may be a suitable reference region for simplified semi-quantitative analysis of 18F-PI2620 and was used to derive SUVRs.

Mean values for AD relevant target regions in bilateral MTL, posterior cingulate, and lateral parietal cortex were extracted and divided by the mean signal within the inferior cerebellum to derive SUVRs for each frame within each participant. Given that many participants had PET data that extended before 60 minutes and/or after 90 minutes post-injection, all available data were plotted to enable visualization over SUVRs over time across all participants (Figure 2). SUVRs corresponding to the late acquisition were consistently elevated in the MTL in the CI group compared to the majority of HC participants. Further, four HC participants showed SUVR values in the MTL that were consistent with values observed in the CI group. Cortical regions showed more heterogeneity within the CI group, with only some of these participants showing elevated signal in the posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortex. Conversely, all four atypical CI participants showed robust uptake in these cortical regions. In general, elevations in SUVR were stable between 60 and 90 minutes post-injection, with the exception of two atypical CI participants with very high binding.

A notable distinction across regions is the range of SUVR values (Figure 2). In particular, SUVRs from the MTL showed the most restricted range, with maximal values in CI participants around 2.5 and some early elevated signal within a subset of HC participants. In contrast, mean SUVR values greater than 3.5 were present in the posterior cingulate and SUVR values greater than 5 were present in the lateral parietal cortex for two atypical CI participants. Further, SUVRs that exceeded 3 continued to show elevations at higher post-injection windows. Relatively stable SUVRs were observed for moderate binders (SUVR&lt;3) during the examined time window across the MTL and cortical ROIs.

Differences across the AD spectrum

Voxelwise SUVR maps corresponding to 60 to 90 minutes post-injection were created and averaged within diagnostic group to enable qualitative examination of the pattern of F-PI-2620 uptake. These average maps showed little uptake in HC, other than off target binding in retina, substantia nigra, and venous sinuses (Figure 3A). Elevations were observed in the MTL and across multiple cortical association areas in the amnestic CI group (Figure 3B), and robust elevations were present throughout posterior association cortices in atypical AD (Figure 3C).

The ROI analysis revealed significantly elevated SUVRs in the CI group compared to the HC group for MTL (W=18; p&lt;0.0001), posterior cingulate (W=55; p=0.00014), and lateral parietal (W=33; p&lt;0.0001; Figure 4). This elevation remained significant across all regions after removing the four atypical CI participants (MTL: W=9, p&lt;0.0001; posterior cingulate: W=55, p=0.018; lateral parietal: W=33, p=0.0012). Within the HC group, age was positively associated with SUVRs across all ROIs (MTL: rho=0.43, p=0.0089; posterior cingulate: rho=0.37, p=0.028; lateral parietal: rho=0.40, p=0.016).

Voxelwise SUVR data corresponding to 60 to 90 minutes post-injection for individual participants are shown for a subset of individual HC (Figure 5). Consistent with the group level average (Figure 3A), there was generally low uptake across HC participants, with some evidence of early medial temporal signal in a subset of cases, and off target binding in retina, substantia nigra, venous sinuses, and choroid plexus (Figure 5C–D). Individuals among the typical CI group showed consistent involvement in the MTL, and variable levels of cortical uptake across participants (Figure 6). Levels of cortical involvement generally tracked with disease severity, with severe cases showing more extensive cortical uptake (Figure 6A) and mild cases showing signal that was restricted to the MTL (Figure 6B). The atypical CI group showed robust elevations throughout posterior association cortices with relative sparing of the medial temporal lobe and frontal cortices across all individual atypical patients (Figure 7).

Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA)

Focal uptake was observed in the anterior temporal pole for one of two patients with svPPA. The younger svPPA patient did not show evidence of elevations that colocalized with atrophy in the anterior temporal lobe (Figure 8A). However, the older svPPA case did show slightly elevated uptake spanning the lateral and anterior temporal lobe (Figure 8B). In general, this off-target binding was associated with SUVR values less than 2.

DISCUSSION

Overall, we found elevated tau PET signal using 18F-PI-2620 in the context of AD. Specifically, signal in the MTL and posterior cortical association areas were elevated in typical Aβ+ amnestic MCI and AD dementia, as well as in atypical non-amnestic clinical presentations of AD. Examination across individual participants showed prominent heterogeneity throughout cortex within amnestic presentations of AD that tended to track with disease severity, whereas elevated signal in the MTL was more consistently present in this group. We found some evidence for slightly elevated values in the temporal lobe of semantic variant PPA, suggesting some low level contributions of off-target binding for 18F-PI-2620. SUVRs normalized to the inferior cerebellum were generally stable 60 to 90 minutes post-injection, but continued to increase in very high binders (with SUVRs&gt;3). This work is the first to report the pattern and magnitude of 18F-PI-2620 tau PET across a broad spectrum of ages and clinical diagnoses, and highlights the promise of this novel second-generation tau PET ligand to measure tau aggregates throughout the course of AD.

There is an urgent need to develop and study disease-specific markers in AD. In recent years, rapid development has been made on in vivo measurements of Aβ and tau imaging markers, with increasing applications present in the research setting. This movement in the field is reflected in the recent National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) research criteria for AD, which promotes a biological definition of the disease by categorizing individuals across Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegenerative dimensions (“A-T-N”) [23]. Although Aβ PET measures have been available for over a decade [24], tau PET ligands have only recently been integrated with multiple different PET ligands currently under investigation [25]. The ability to measure tau aggregation accurately holds particular promise as a biomarker for AD, given that tau deposits are known to be more proximal to clinical deficits as compared to Aβ plaques [10], and the majority of Aβ-induced toxicity is thought to be mediated by tau accumulation [11]. Further, the field has seen a string of failures in clinical trials of anti-Aβ approaches [26, 27], and there is some hope that targeting tau may be a more effective strategy [28]. Given that the amount and pattern of tau pathology varies across patients diagnosed clinically with Alzheimer’s disease dementia [5], the ability to screen for the presence of Aβ and tau pathology would also assist in the design and enrollment of clinical trials. Thus, although the incorporation of tau PET into the research setting is a recent advancement, there is strong agreement in the field of the importance of this modality for in vivo assessment of tau in humans.

Promising tau PET ligands have been available for over 5 years, including 18F-AV1451 [2], 18F-GTP1 [29], 1SF-R06958948 [30], and more recently 18F-MK6240 [31] as well as 18F-PI-2620 [12, 13]. Initial work examining tau PET has provided important insights and is largely consistent with expected patterns of tangle deposition established in post-mortem studies [32, 33], large group level differences between healthy controls and patients with AD [4, 5, 34], as well as early focal signal in older, Aβ-positive controls (“preclinical AD”) that is associated with subtle memory changes [6, 35]. However, there is evidence of off-target binding that may contaminate relevant signal in target regions. For instance, F-AV1451, which is the most extensively studied ligand to date, demonstrates off-target binding in the choroid plexus, which is adjacent to the hippocampus and therefore compromises the ability to measure tau uptake in this key AD region [36]. Off-target binding has also been observed in the basal ganglia, which may imply off-target binding to iron accumulation or possibly focal neuronal injury such as small infarcts and white matter disease [36, 37]. It remains unclear whether these sources of off-target binding will impact the ability to use tau PET as a diagnostic tool in certain situations. Given these uncertainties, it is important for the field to apply novel tau ligands and evaluate their utility as they become available.

To this end, we explored 18F-PI-2620 PET across a broad range of ages and clinical presentations. This work builds off recent work exploring 18F-PI-2620 in 10 healthy controls and 12 AD patients[12, 13]. However, this work was limited by a younger age in the healthy control group (mean age of 59 years compared to 69 years in the AD group), which may exaggerate diagnostic differences and minimize off-target binding. Specifically, our dataset of forty-nine participants spanned older healthy controls between age 61 to 86, Aβ+ MCI, Aβ+ patients with clinical AD dementia, as well as semantic variant PPA. Given multiple reports showing differences in tau PET magnitude between typical and atypical AD [9, 32], we additionally separated our patients with clinical impairment into typical amnestic and atypical non-amnestic groups based on these clinical features. Overall, we found elevations in 18F-PI-2620 Tau PET across the spectrum of AD in regions known to be impacted in AD (medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate, and lateral parietal). Specifically, we found group differences between healthy controls and clinically impaired groups (Aβ+ MCI and Aβ+ AD dementia). When examining the clinically impaired group, we found a more robust posterior signal in atypical AD patients that presented clinically with features of posterior cortical atrophy. Our typical amnestic MCI and AD patients showed heterogeneity in cortex, with some individuals showing clear tau PET signal in multiple association cortices and some patients showing little signal beyond the MTL. Given our small sample of patients with clinical impairment, we were not able to examine the primary drivers of this heterogeneity. However, previous tau PET studies have shown that tau PET signal may be reduced in older versus younger participants [5, 32, 34], perhaps due to contributions of various age-related etiologies that are common in older patients and may be drivers of clinical impairment (such as vascular insults, and TDP-43 pathology) [38]. It is also likely that variation in tau PET varies across disease severity [4, 5], as we did tend to see that less impaired patients showed restricted signal when examining individual participants. Off-target binding was observed in retina, substantia nigra, venous sinuses across most participants. Low levels of choroid plexus off target binding was noticed across some participants. The basal ganglia did not show any evidence of off-target binding, which is a common site of off-target binding across other tracers [36]. Larger datasets with 18F-PI-2620 PET will be needed to understand the factors that best predict the extent of uptake among Aβ+ MCI and AD participants in target regions, as well as the prevalence and magnitude of off target binding.

Examination of two cases with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) provided evidence of subtle off-target binding in the anterior temporal lobe in one case. This uptake suggests binding related to degeneration independent of tau aggregations, given that svPPA is most likely associated with TDP-43 pathology [39]. The pattern of focal subtle uptake in patients with TDP-43 has been reported in previous studies with 18F-AV1451[16, 40, 41]. In the absence of a head to head comparison, it is not possible to determine whether the magnitude of this specific source of off-target binding varies across PET ligands.

Overall, our study is the first to comprehensively examine 18F-PI-2620 across a broad spectrum of aging and individuals on the AD spectrum. Our results highlight the utility of this tracer in detecting tau aggregates in AD. Larger studies will be necessary to determine whether the sources of off-target binding will impair the ability of 18F-PI-2620 to measure tau pathology throughout the course of disease, especially regarding longitudinal estimates of change and the ability to detect early signal within the medial temporal lobe that is expected to emerge among healthy older adults. Additionally, further work is needed to explore potential reference regions as well as the optimal time acquisition period for data acquisition.
