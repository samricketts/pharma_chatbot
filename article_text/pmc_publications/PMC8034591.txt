As a hot topic in brain disease prognosis, predicting clinical measures of subjects based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data helps assess the stage of pathology and predict future development of the disease. Due to incomplete clinical labels/scores, previous learning-based studies often simply discard subjects without ground-truth scores. This would result in limited training data for learning reliable and robust models. Also, existing methods focus only on using hand-crafted features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume) of MRI data, and these features may not be well coordinated with prediction models. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised Densely-connected Neural Network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first extract multi-scale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images, and then develop a weakly-supervised densely-connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects (even those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training. Experimental results on 1,469 subjects from both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently predict future clinical measures of subjects.

I. INTRODUCTION

AS the most sensitive imaging test of the head (particularly the brain) in routine clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows physicians to evaluate medical conditions of the brain and determine the presence of certain diseases. Currently, MRI has been widely used in computeraided diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [1–6]. In particular, structural MRI provides a non-invasive solution to potentially identify abnormal structural changes of the brain, and helps identify AD-related imaging biomarkers for clinical applications [1, 4, 7–9]. Recently, it has been remaining a hot topic to assess the stage of pathology and predict future advances of AD and MCI, by estimating clinical scores of subjects in future time using baseline MRI data.

Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for predicting clinical scores using baseline MRI [11], a common challenge of existing methods is the weakly-labeled data problem, i.e., subjects may miss ground-truth clinical scores/labels at certain time-points. As shown in Fig. 1, among 805 subjects at baseline (BL) time in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset [10], only 622 subjects and 631 subjects have complete scores of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at the 24th month (M24) after the baseline time, respectively. Due to the nature of supervised learning, previous studies merely discard subjects with missing clinical scores. For instance, Zhang et al. [11] estimated 2year changes of two clinical measures from baseline MRI, using only 186 subjects with complete ground-truth clinical scores from ADNI-1. It is worth noting that removing subjects with missing scores will significantly reduce the number of training samples, thus affecting the accuracy and robustness of prediction models. Also, previous machine-learning methods usually feed pre-defined representations (e.g., image intensity and tissue volume within regions-of-interest (ROIs)) of MR images to subsequent prediction models, while these features may not be optimal for prediction models, thus degrading the prognosis performance.

Inspired by the recent success of deep-learning techniques in medical image analysis [7, 12, 13], several studies resort to deep neural networks to extract MRI features for AD/MCI diagnosis in a data-driven manner [14–16]. However, these methods are generally within the supervised learning framework, and thus, cannot directly employ subjects with incomplete ground-truth clinical scores for network training. Therefore, to use all available weakly-labeled data (i.e., training subjects with incomplete ground-truth scores at certain time-points) becomes an essential problem in MRI-based brain disease prognosis.

In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised Deep Neural Network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using subjects with baseline MRI and incomplete ground-truth clinical scores at multiple time-points. The schematic diagram of our method is shown in Fig. 2. We first pre-process all MR images, and then extract multi-scale image patches based on multiple AD-related anatomical landmarks. A deep convolutional neural network is finally developed for joint prediction of multiple clinical scores at multiple time-points, with a unique weighted loss function that allows the network to learn from weakly-labeled training data. Compared with previous MRI-based studies, our proposed wiseDNN method can employ all available subjects (even though some of them may lack clinical scores at certain time-points) for model training. Also, our anatomical landmark based multi-scale patch extraction strategy can partly alleviate the problem of limited data, by using image patches other than entire 3D MR images as the training samples.

The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. First, we develop a neural network with a weighted loss function that can employ all available weakly-labeled subjects (i.e., with incomplete ground-truth clinical scores), without discarding subjects having missing scores as in previous studies [11, 17]. This may help improve the robustness of the learned network by including more subjects in the training process. Second, based on AD-related anatomical landmarks, we propose to extract multi-scale (rather than fixed-sized) image patches from MRI, where both small-scale and large-scale patches centered at each landmark are extracted. This kind of strategy helps to capture both local and global structural information of brain MRIs. Third, we develop a joint prediction strategy for estimating multiple clinical scores at multiple time-points simultaneously. Such joint learning strategy is expected to model the inherent relationship among different scores at/across different time-points, thus helping to improve the prediction performance. Finally, based on an MR image of a new test subject, the proposed method can simultaneously predict four types of clinical scores at four time-points within 12s, which is close to real-time.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We present the most relevant studies in Section II. In Section III, we introduce the materials used in this study and elaborate the details of our proposed method. In Section IV, we first introduce experimental settings and methods for comparison, and then present experimental results of clinical score prediction on both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets. In Section V, we compare our method with previous studies and discuss limitations of the current study as well as possible future research directions. We finally conclude this paper in Section VI.

II. RELATED WORK

In this section, we first introduce conventional representations of structural brain MRIs, and then present recent MRI-based deep-learning studies for brain disease prognosis/diagnosis.

A. Representations of Structural Brain MR Images

Thanks to the development of neuroimaging techniques, we can directly access brain structures provided by MRI to understand the neurodegenerative underpinnings of AD and MCI [1, 4]. In the literature, many types of feature representations of brain MRI have been developed for automatic AD/MCI diagnosis and prognosis. These representations can be roughly categorized into three classes, i.e., 1) voxel-based representation, 2) ROI-based representation, and 3) patch-based representation, with details given below.

1) Voxel-based Representation:

In general, voxel-based approaches [18–20] compare brain MR images by directly measuring local tissue (e.g., gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) density of a brain via voxel-wise analysis, after deformable registration of individual brain images. For instance, Fan et al. [21, 22] proposed to extract volumetric features from brain regions from MR images and applied them to AD classification and gender classification. However, voxel-based methods are often based on the assumption of one-to-one anatomical mapping between subjects and Gaussian distributions of focal tissue densities during statistical testing [23]. To make data fit the voxel-based model, tissue densities are blurred with large kernels at the expense of focal accuracy, and therefore may reduce the discriminative power of voxel-based representation for MRIs. Another disadvantage of voxel-based representation is that feature dimension is often very high (e.g., millions), while the number of training subjects is very limited (e.g., hundreds), leading to the small-sample-size problem [24] and degrading the performance of learned models.

2) ROI-based Representation:

Different from voxel-based features, ROI-based representations focus on measuring regionally anatomical volumes in pre-defined regions in the brain. In particular, previous ROI-based studies often employ tissue volume [11, 25–27], cortical thickness [28–33], hippocampal volume [34–36] and tissue density [9, 17, 31, 32, 37, 38] in specific brain regions as feature representation of MR images. However, this type of representation requires a priori hypothesis on abnormal regions from a structural/functional perspective to define regions in the brain [39], while such a hypothesis may not always hold in practice. For example, an abnormal brain region might span over multiple ROIs or just a small part of an ROI, so using a fixed partition for the brain could produce suboptimal learning performance.

3) Patch-based Representation:

Patch-based morphometry was developed to detect fine anatomical changes in brain MRIs, by taking advantage of non-local analysis to model the one-to-many mapping between brain anatomies [23]. As reported in [16, 23, 37, 40–42], neurodegenerative patterns can be presented through a patch-based analysis for assisting AD diagnosis and also evaluating the progression of MCI. Liu et al. [37, 41] employed GM density within local patches as the representation of MRI for AD diagnosis, using randomly selected patches (i.e., without localizing AD-related microstructures in the brain). Zhang et al. [6] proposed to extract morphometric features (i.e., local energy pattern [43]) from image patches located by AD-related anatomical landmarks. These hand-crafted features of MRI are usually fed to predefined models (e.g., support vector machine [6, 41] and sparse representation [37]) for disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, since feature extraction and model training are performed independently in these methods, those pre-extracted MRI features may not be optimal for prediction models.

B. Deep-Learning for Brain Disease Prognosis/Diagnosis

Recently, several deep-learning methods have been proposed to automatically learn MRI features in a task-oriented manner. However, to directly feed the whole MR image into a convolutional neural network (CNN) could not generate robust models, since there are millions of voxels in an MR image and many brain regions may be not affected by dementia. Hence, a common challenge in MRI-based deep-learning is determining how to precisely locate informative (e.g., discriminative between different groups) regions in brain MRIs.

To address this challenge, Zhang et al. [15] proposed to focus on three ROIs (i.e., hippocampal, ventricular, and cortical thickness surface) in brain MRI, and developed a deep CNN for predicting clinical measures of subjects using 2D image patches extracted from three ROIs. Khvostikov et al. [44] employed only the hippocampal ROI and surrounding regions in brain scans (i.e., both structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data) for learning a CNN. Similarly, Li et al. [14] presented a deep ordinal ranking model for AD classification, using the hippocampal ROI in MRIs. However, these studies use empirically-defined regions in MRI, without considering other potentially important brain regions that may be affected by brain diseases. Besides, Sarraf et al. [45] developed a 2D CNN for identifying AD patients from healthy controls (HCs) using both structural and functional MRI (fMRI) data. However, they simply convert 3D MR images and 4D fMR images into 2D slices as the input of their networks, ignoring the important spatial information of slices in MRIs. More recently, Liu et al. [16, 46] proposed an anatomical landmark based deep learning framework for AD diagnosis and MCI conversion prediction. Specifically, they first locate 3D image patches via AD-related anatomical landmarks distributed throughout the brain, and then develop a CNN for joint feature extraction from MRI and disease classification. However, a fixed size of image patches is used in these studies, without considering that structural changes caused by dementia could vary largely among different brain regions.

Besides, most of the existing deep-learning methods are performed in a fully-supervised manner, by merely discarding subjects with missing ground-truth scores at certain time-points. To adequately employ all available subjects (even those without ground-truth scores at multiple time-points) for model training, we propose a weakly-supervised CNN for predicting clinical measures based on baseline MRI data. The proposed method is different from previous studies in [46]. Specifically, in this work, we focus on making use of weakly-labeled training subjects by developing a unique weighted loss function in the proposed neural network, while previous methods [46] can only use fully-labeled (i.e., with complete ground-truth scores) training subjects. Also, this study proposes to extract multi-scale image patches centered at each landmark location to model multi-scale structural information of each brain MRI, while those in [46] only use fixed-sized image patches.

III. MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section, we first introduce studied subjects and the procedure of MR image pre-processing, and then present the proposed method in detail.

A. Subjects and Image Pre-processing

We perform experiments on 1,469 subjects from two subsets of the public ADNI database [10], including ADNI-1 and ADNI-2. Specifically, there are 805 subjects with baseline structural MRI data from ADNI-1, and 664 subjects with baseline structural MRI data from ADNI-2. Note that subjects that appear in both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 are directly removed from ADNI-2. Also, different from subjects with 1.5T T1weighted MRI in ADNI-1, the studied subjects in ADNI-2 have 3.0T T1-weighted MRI. That is, ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 are two independent datasets in our experiments. According to several criteria1, these subjects can be categorized into three classes, i.e., AD, MCI, and HC.

For each subject, four types of clinical measures/scores are used in the experiments, including 1) CDR-SB, 2) classic Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) sub-scale with 11 items (ADAS-Cog11), 3) modified ADAS-Cog with 13 items (ADAS-Cog13), and 4) MMSE. The date when subjects were scheduled to perform the screening becomes the baseline (BL) time after approval. Also, the time-points for follow-up visits are denoted by the duration starting from the baseline time. Specifically, we denote M06, M12, and M24 as the 6th month, 12th month, and 24th month after BL, respectively. All studied subjects have MRI data at BL, while many have missing ground-truth scores at certain time-points regarding a specific clinical measure. The detailed information about the studied subjects is shown in Table I.

For each structural MR image corresponding to a specific subject, we first perform anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC) correction, followed by skull stripping and cerebellum removal. We then linearly align each image to a common Colin27 template [47], and further re-sample all MR images to have the same size (i.e., 152 × 186 × 144 with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 × 1mm3). Using the N3 algorithm [48], we finally perform intensity inhomogeneity correction for each MR image.

B. Proposed Method

In this study, we attempt to deal with two challenging problems in MRI-based brain disease prognosis, i.e., 1) how to make full use of weakly-labeled training data (i.e., subjects with incomplete ground-truth clinical scores); and 2) how to learn informative features of structural MR images. To this end, we develop a weakly-supervised CNN to integrate feature extraction and model learning into a unified framework, where a unique weighted loss function is used to employ all available weakly-labeled subjects for network training. Specifically, there are two main steps in the proposed wiseDNN method, i.e., 1) extraction of multi-scale image patches and 2) weakly-supervised neural network, with details given below.

1) Extraction of Multi-scale Image Patches:

While there are millions of voxels in each brain MR image, the structural changes caused by dementia could be subtle, especially in the early stage of AD (e.g., MCI). If we directly feed the whole MR image into a deep neural network, the input data will include too much noisy/irrelevant information, bringing difficulty in network training based on only a limited (i.e., hundreds) number of training subjects. Therefore, to facilitate the network training for accurate disease prognosis, we would like to first locate informative brain regions in each MRI, rather than using the whole image.

Following [42], we resort to anatomical landmarks to locate AD-related regions in brain MRIs. To be specific, we apply a landmark detection algorithm [42] to generate a total of 1,741 anatomical landmarks defined in the Colin27 template [47]. As shown in Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Materials, many landmarks are spatially close to each other. To reduce the information redundancy and computational burden, we select K = 40 anatomical landmarks from the original landmark pool via the following steps. We first rank these landmarks in the ascending order according to their p-values, where such p-values are generated by the landmark detection algorithm [42] by group comparison between AD and HC subjects. We then use a spatial Euclidean distance threshold (i.e., 20) as a criterion to control the distance between landmarks, and the top K = 40 landmarks are finally chosen to be used in this work. As an illustration, we show the identified landmarks on three typical subjects in Fig. 3, while these landmarks shown in the template space can be found in Fig. S2 of the Supplementary Materials.

Based on these identified landmarks, we extract multiscale image patches located by each landmark from an input MRI, to capture richer structural information of brain MRIs. Specifically, centered at each landmark, we extract both smallscale (i.e., with the size of 24×24×24) and large-scale (i.e., with the size of 48×48×48) patches from each MRI. Hence, given K landmarks, we can obtain 2K image patches from each subject (corresponding to a particular MRI). These multi-scale image patches will be used as the input data of our proposed neural network.

2) Weakly-supervised Neural Network:

Using multi-scale image patches from each MRI, we jointly perform feature learning of MRIs and regression of multiple clinical scores at four time-points via the proposed neural network (with the architecture given in Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 4, the input of the proposed network includes 2K image patches from each subject, and the output contains four types of clinical measures (i.e., CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog11, ADAS-Cog13, and MMSE) at four time-points (i.e., BL, M06, M12, and M24).

We first focus on modeling relatively local structural information contained in multi-scale image patches via K parallel sub-networks, with each sub-network corresponding to a specific landmark location. In each sub-network, we first down-sample the large-scale (i.e., 48×48×48) patch to have the same size as that of the small-scale (i.e., 24×24×24) patch. Then, these two small-scale patches are treated as the two-channel input and fed into each sub-network that contains a sequence of three densely-connected modules (DCMs) and two fully-connected (FC) layers. There are three convolutional layers in each DCM, followed by a 2 × 2 × 2 max-pooling layer for feature map down-sampling. Particularly, for a specific convolutional layer in each DCM, feature maps (i.e., output images of each convolutional layer) of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature maps are used as inputs for all subsequent layers. All convolutional layers are followed by batch normalization and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. It has been proven that such densely-connected architecture is useful in strengthening feature propagation, encouraging feature reuse, as well as substantially reducing the number of parameters to be optimized in the network [49]. Even though the K parallel sub-networks share the same architecture, their parameter weights are optimized independently. The motivation is that we would like to learn landmark-specific local features from image patches via K sub-networks to keep the unique local structural information provided by each landmark location. If those sub-networks share parameters, we would not be able to capture the landmark-specific local structural information of brain MRIs via shallow sub-networks.

It is worth noting that using only each local patch individually would not be able to capture the global structure of an MRI. To this end, the feature maps learned from the last K FC layers in K sub-networks are further concatenated, followed by two additional FC layers for learning local-to-global feature representations of the input MR image. The final FC layer (with 32 neurons) is employed to predict four types of clinical scores at four time-points.

Inspired by [50], we design a weighted loss function in the proposed network, to make full use of all available weakly-labeled training subjects (with missing ground-truth clinical scores at certain time-points). We denote X =[x1,···,xn,···,xN] as the training set containing N subjects, where W is the network coefficient. For the n-th (n = 1,··· ,N) subject xn, its s-th (s = 1,··· ,S) ground-truth clinical score at the t-th (t = 1,··· ,T) time-point is denoted as yns,t. The proposed objective function aims to minimize the difference between the predicted score fs,t(xn;W) and the ground truth yns,t in the following: argmin (1) argminW1N∑n=1N1∑t=1T∑s=1Sγns,t∑t=1T∑s=1Sγns,t(yns,t−fs,t(xn;W))2,

where γns,t is an indicator to denote whether xn is labeled with the s-th clinical score at the t-th time-point. Specifically, γns,t = 1 if the ground-truth score γns,t is available for xn; and γns,t = 0, otherwise. To be specific, even when a training subject has missing scores at certain time-points and does not contribute to the loss computation (i.e., γns,t, it can still contribute to the prediction tasks at the remaining time-points during the network training. Hence, more samples can be employed at different time-points. Using Eq. 1, we can not only automatically learn feature representation of MR images in a data-driven manner, but also utilize all available subjects (even though some of them may lack ground-truth clinical scores at several time-points) for model training. This is different from the conventional supervised methods [14, 16, 46] that simply discard subjects with incomplete ground-truth scores.

3) Implementation:

To augment the training samples as well as reduce the negative influence of landmark detection errors, we randomly sample different patches centered at each landmark location with displacements within a 5×5×5 cubic, and the step size is 1. Thus, a total of 125 patches centered at each landmark can be extracted from each MRI at each scale. Given K landmarks, we can obtain 125K combinations of patches at each scale, with each combination being regarded as a particular sample for the proposed network. In this way, we can theoretically generate 125K samples for representing each MR image, and these samples will be randomly used as the input data of the proposed network. More details can be found in Fig. S4 of the Supplementary Materials.

At the training stage, we train the network based on the training subjects, using their baseline MRIs as input and the corresponding ground-truth four clinical scores at four time-points (with missing values) as output. Specifically, based on K anatomical landmarks, we first sample multi-scale (i.e.., 24×24×24 and 48×48×48) image patches from each train MRI, and then feed these patches to the network. In this way, we can learn a nonlinear mapping from each input MRI to its four clinical scores at four time-points. At the testing stage, for an unseen test subject with only a baseline MR image, we first locate its corresponding landmarks via the deep-learning-based landmark detection algorithm [42], and then extract multiscale patches based on these landmarks. Finally, we feed these multi-scale image patches into the learned network to predict the clinical scores at four time-points for this test subject.

We implement the proposed network using Keras [51] with Tensorflow backend [52]. The objective function in Eq. 1 is optimized by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach [53] combined with a back-propagation algorithm for computing network gradients as well as parameter update. Specifically, we empirically set the momentum coefficient and the learning rate for SGD to 0.9 and 10−4, respectively. The change curves of the training and validation loss function on the ADNI-1 dataset can be found in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Materials. Particularly, for an unseen testing subject with baseline MRI, our method requires approximately 12s for predicting its four types of clinical measures at four time-points, using a computer with a single GPU (i.e., NVIDIA GTX TITAN 12GB). This implies that the proposed wiseDNN method is expected to perform real-time brain disease prognosis in real-world applications. For readers’ convenience, the code and the pre-trained model have been made publicly available online2.

IV. EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we first present the experimental settings and introduce the methods for comparison. We then present and analyze the experimental results achieved by different methods on both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets, and compare our method with several state-of-the-art methods for MRI-based Alzheimer’s disease prognosis.

A. Experimental Settings

To investigate the robustness of the proposed method, we perform two groups of experiments in a two-fold cross-validation manner. Specifically, in the first group of experiments, we train models on subjects from ADNI-1, and test them on subjects from the independent ADNI-2 dataset. In the second group, we train models on ADNI-2 and test them on ADNI-1, respectively. In the experiments, we aim to predict four types of clinical scores (i.e., CDR-SB, ADAS-Cog11, ADAS-Cog13, and MMSE) at four time-points (i.e., BL, M06, M12, and M24), by using baseline MRI data. Two criteria are used to evaluate the performance of our method and those competing approaches, including 1) the correlation coefficient (CC) and 2) the root mean square error (RMSE) between the ground-truth and predicted clinical scores achieved by a particular method. We also perform a paired t-test (with a significance level of 0.05) on prediction results achieved by our wiseDNN method and each specific comparison method.

B. Methods for Comparison

We first compare the proposed wiseDNN method with three conventional feature representations of brain MRI, including 1) voxel-based tissue density (denoted as Voxel) [19], 2) ROI-based GM volume (denoted as ROI) [11], and 3) landmark-based morphological features (denoted as LMF) [42]. The details of these methods are introduced in the following.

1) Voxel:

In this method, a non-linear image registration algorithm [54] is first applied to spatially normalize all MR images to the template space. Then, the FAST algorithm in the FSL package [55] is employed to segment each MR image into three tissues (i.e., GM, WM, and CSF). Then, the local GM tissue density in each voxel is used as a feature value. The feature vector (with each element corresponding to a particular voxel) of each MR image is finally fed into a support vector regressor (SVR) for clinical score regression. For each type of clinical scores at a specific time-point, a linear SVR (with a default parameter C = 1) will be learned based on training subjects, and thus models for different scores at different time-points are independently trained in this method.

2) ROI:

Similar to the Voxel method, the ROI method first segments the GM tissue from the spatially normalized MR image. Using a non-linear registration algorithm, the subject-labeled image based on the AAL template with 90 manually labeled ROIs can be generated. For each of 90 brain regions in the labeled MR image, the GM tissue volume of that region is computed as a feature. Then, a 90-dimensional feature vector can be generated for each MR image, and such a feature vector is then fed into a linear SVR (with a default parameter C = 1) for independent regression of different clinical scores at different time-points.

3) LMF:

In this method, the same K landmarks as those used in our method are employed to locate AD-related image patches in MRI. Specifically, centered at a particular landmark, LMF first extracts an image patch (24 × 24 × 24), and then compute the 100-dimensional local energy pattern [43] as features for this patch. By concatenating these patch-based features, a 100Kdimensional feature vector is finally obtained for representing each MR image, followed by a linear SVR for clinical score regression.

Three critical strategies are used in wiseDNN, i.e., 1) joint prediction of multiple clinical scores at multiple time-points, 2) multi-scale patch extraction, and 3) utilization of weakly-supervised subjects (with complete baseline MRI data and incomplete ground-truth clinical scores) for model training. To investigate the influence of each strategy, we further compare wiseDNN with its four variants, with details given below.

wiseDNN-IS that independently trains a model for each clinical measure using only small-scale (i.e., 24 × 24 × 24) patches. In wiseDNN-IS, we simply train an independent network for each type of clinical measure at each time-point, with the input of small-scale image patches centered at K landmark locations.

wiseDNN-I that learns an independent network for each type of clinical scores using multi-scale patches. Specifically, in wiseDNN-I, we separately train a specific network for each type of clinical scores at each time-point, without exploiting the underlying relationship among different clinical measure and that among different timepoints.

wiseDNN-S that uses only small-scale patches for learning a joint network for four clinical measures. In this method, we only extract a small-scale (24 × 24 × 24) patch from each landmark location in an MR image, without accounting for more global information of that image captured by large-scale (48 × 48 × 48) patches.

wiseDNN-C that uses only labeled subjects (i.e., with complete ground-truth clinical scores at four time-points) for network training. In other words, in wiseDNN-C, subjects with clinical scores missed at least at one time-point will be discarded. In contrast, wiseDNN can use all weakly-labeled subjects for network training via a weighted loss function in Eq. 1. For a fair comparison, similar to wiseDNN, wiseDNN-C uses multi-scale image patches for joint prediction of four types of clinical scores at four time-points.

In summary, the proposed wiseDNN method is compared with seven methods in the experiments. Among these methods, five approaches (i.e., Voxel, ROI, LMF, wiseDNN-IS, and wiseDNN-I) independently train models for different clinical measures, while three approaches (i.e., wiseDNN-S, wiseDNN-C, and wiseDNN) jointly predict multiple clinical measures. In three conventional feature based methods (i.e., Voxel, ROI, and LMF), a linear SVR (with a default parameter C = 1) will be learned independently for each type of clinical scores at each time-point. Six landmark-based methods (i.e., LMF, wiseDNN-IS, wiseDNN-I, wiseDNN-S, wiseDNN-C, and wiseDNN) share the same landmark pool as shown in Fig. 3. Also, four methods (i.e., Voxel, ROI, LMF, and wiseDNN-C) can only employ subjects with complete ground-truth scores at four time-points, while the remaining ones (i.e., wiseDNN-IS, wiseDNN-I, wiseDNN-S, and wiseDNN) can take advantage of all available training subjects (even though some of them may lack clinical scores at certain time-points).

C. Prognosis Results on ADNI-2

In this group of experiments, we train models on ADNI-1, and test them on ADNI-2. In Table II, we report the CC values achieved by eight different methods, with ∗ denoting that the results of wiseDNN are statistically significantly better than other compared methods (p &lt; 0.05) using pairwise t-test. Besides, the RMSE values obtained by different methods are reported in Fig. 5. We further show scatter plots of the groundtruth vs. predicted scores achieved by our proposed wiseDNN method in Fig. 6. From Table II and Figs. 5–6, one could have the following observations.

First, methods (i.e., wiseDNN-IS, wiseDNN-I, wiseDNN-S, wiseDNN-C, and wiseDNN) using task-oriented features via neural networks usually yield better results (regarding both CC and RMSE), compared with methods (i.e., Voxel, ROI, and LMF) using hand-crafted features of MRI. Also, even though LMF employs the same landmarks as wiseDNN to locate patches in MRI, its performance is worse than that of wiseDNN. For instance, LMF achieves a CC value of 0.431, which is worse than that (i.e., 0.539) of wiseDNN in predicting CDR-SB at BL. This may occur due to that LMF uses expert defined features of MRI for disease prognosis, where these features may not be well coordinated with subsequent prediction models. These findings imply that the integration of feature extraction into model learning (as we do in this work) helps improve the prognosis performance.

Second, compared with those methods (i.e., Voxel, ROI, wiseDNN-IS, and wiseDNN-I) that independently learn models for different clinical scores, the proposed methods (i.e., wiseDNN-S, wiseDNN-C, and wiseDNN) that jointly predicting multiple scores generally yield higher CC and lower RMSE values. It suggests that our joint learning strategy could boost the learning performance, by implicitly exploiting the inherent relationship among different clinical measures.

In addition, methods (i.e., wiseDNN-C, and wiseDNN) using multi-scale image patches consistently outperform their counterparts (i.e., wiseDNN-IS, and wiseDNN-S) using only single-scale patches, in terms of both CC and RMSE values. Thanks to both small-scale and large-scale image patches, wiseDNN-C and wiseDNN can model more global structure information of MRI, while wiseDNN-IS and wiseDNN-S merely focus on local information of MRI via single-scale patches. This could partly explain why using multi-scale image patches can generate better prediction results.

Finally, the performance of each method slightly decreases over time in predicting four types of clinical scores. As an example, wiseDNN obtains an RMSE value of 3.408 at M24, which is worse than that (i.e., 2.554) at BL in predicting MMSE. This result may be caused by the fact that we only use baseline MRI data to predict clinical scores at four time-points, while the brain structure may slightly change along time after baseline time. A more reasonable solution is to use MRI at multiple time-points for predicting clinical scores at different time-points, which is expected to generate better performance.

D. Prognosis Results on ADNI-1

In the second group of experiments, we train and test learning models on ADNI-2 and ADNI-1, respectively. The CC and RMSE values achieved by different methods are shown in Table III and Fig. 7, respectively. From Table III and Fig. 7, We can see that, in most cases, our proposed wiseDNN method achieves better performance than the competing methods, regarding both CC and RMSE values.

Besides, it can be observed from Tables II and III and Figs. 7 and 5 that wiseDNN is superior to wiseDNN-C in predicting four types of clinical scores at four time-points. Note that wiseDNN uses all subjects with incomplete ground-truth scores for model training, while wiseDNN-C employs only subjects with complete scores. These results imply that using all available weakly-labeled subjects for model learning, as we do in wiseDNN, provides a good solution to improve the prognosis performance. Also, Tables III and II suggest that the proposed wiseDNN method achieves comparable results using independent models trained on ADNI-1 and ADNI-2, respectively. This implies that our method has a good generalization ability because MRIs in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 were acquired by 1.5T and 3.0T scanners, respectively.

In addition, we can see from Tables II-III that the overall correlation between the estimated scores achieved by all eight methods and the ground-truth scores are not high, and hence these methods are not yet ready to be used in a clinical setting. The underlying reason could be that the brain MRIs of subjects within four categories (AD, pMCI, sMCI and HC) are combined for network training. Note that, it is challenging to accurately distinguish between four categories, because the AD-related structural changes of the brain could be very subtle. Besides, MCI is the early stage of AD, and many MCI subjects (such as sMCI) will not necessarily convert to AD, leading to the complex data distribution of four categories.

E. Comparison with State-of-the-art Methods

In the literature, several methods have been proposed to predict clinical scores at multiple time-points [11, 46]. However, there are at least two major differences between our wiseDNN method and the conventional studies [11, 46]. Specifically, our wiseDNN method can automatically learn discriminative feature representations for MR images via a deep CNN, rather than using hand-crafted features (ROI-based GM tissue volume) [11]. Also, different from [11, 46] that use only training subjects with complete ground-truth labels/scores, wiseDNN can utilize all weakly-labeled (i.e., with incomplete ground-truth clinical scores) subjects for model learning, thus significantly increasing the number of training subjects and potentially boosting the diagnosis performance.

For comparison, we further report the prognosis results achieved by wiseDNN and these two previous methods, i.e., multi-modal multi-task learning (M3TL) [11] and deep multitask multi-channel learning (DM2L) [46]). Note that, M3TL relies on an independent linear SVR for clinical score regression at each time-point, while both DM2L and our wiseDNN methods perform the joint regression of multiple clinical scores via CNNs. For predicting two types of clinical scores (i.e., ADAS-Cog11 and MMSE) at two time-points (i.e., BL and M24), models in this group of experiments are trained on ADNI-1 and tested on ADNI-2, respectively. Both M3TL and DM2L can only employ subjects with complete ground-truth clinical scores for model training, while our wiseDNN method is capable of using all available subjects.

In Fig. 8, we report the CC and RMSE values in terms of the ground-truth and estimated clinical scores achieved by three different methods. It can be observed from Fig. 8 that our wiseDNN method outperforms M3TL and DM2L in most cases, further suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method. Besides, compared with M3TL that uses conventional hand-crafted features of MRI, two deep-learning methods (i.e., DM2L and wiseDNN) consistently yield higher CC and lower RMSE values, further suggesting that incorporating task-oriented feature learning into the process of training prognosis models can further improve the learning performance.

V. DISCUSSION

In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised deep neural network (wiseDNN) for simultaneous prediction of multiple clinical scores at multiple time-points, using subjects with baseline MRI data and incomplete ground-truth scores. This method is potentially useful in clinical practice for disease prognosis in a fast and objective way. For instance, given a subject who is suspected to have AD or MCI evaluated by a physician, we can acquire the baseline brain MR image. Using the proposed framework, we can feed this baseline MRI to the trained network to predict how the clinical status changes over time for this patient, requiring only about 12 seconds. In the following, we analyze the influence of parameters and the effect of different network architectures, and then present the limitation of this work and possible future research direction.

A. Parameter Analysis

We now evaluate the effect of the number of landmarks on the performance of the proposed wiseDNN method. In this group of experiments, we vary the number of landmarks in the range of [10,20,···,60], and record the CC and RMSE results achieved by wiseDNN in MMSE regression. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 9, with models trained and tested on ADNI-1 and ADNI-2, respectively.

From Fig. 9, we can observe that wiseDNN with less than 20 landmarks does not produce satisfactory results. The underlying reason could be that using a limited number of landmarks are not able to effectively capture global structural information of the brain MRI, thus leading to sub-optimal learning performance. Besides, using more landmarks (e.g., 30), the results of our method are stable. Considering the computational burden, the optimal number of landmarks for our method can be selected in the range of [30,50].

B. Effect of Densely-connected Module

In the proposed network shown in Fig. 4, we employ three densely-connected modules (DCMs) in each sub-network to learn patch-level local features. To study the influence of these DCMs, we further perform a group of experiments by replacing three DCMs with three residual learning modules (RLMs) [56] and denote this new network as wiseDNN-R. Note that wiseDNN-R and wiseDNN share the same input and objective functions. In Fig. S5 of the Supplementary Materials, we show the network architecture of wiseDNN-R. The experimental results produced by both wiseDNN and wiseDNN-R in estimating MMSE scores at four time-points are reported in Fig. 10. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that wiseDNN-R achieves similar results with wiseDNN. This demonstrates that our proposed landmark-based weakly-supervised framework has strong compatibility with different types of network structures.

C. Limitation and Future Work

The current work still has several limitations, as listed below. 1) The proposed method was only validated on predicting clinical scores using only baseline MRI scans, although there exist longitudinal MRI scans for subjects in both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets. The challenge of using longitudinal MRI scans for clinical score prediction is that many subjects have missing MRI scans at later time-points. 2) The current network primarily works for estimating multiple types of clinical scores, without considering the underlying association between clinical scores and class labels (e.g., AD or HC) of subjects. 3) The pre-selection of local patches based on anatomical landmarks is still independent of feature extraction and classifier construction, which may hamper the prognostic performance. 4) We did not consider the difference of data distribution of subjects in ADNI-1 and ADNI-2. This may negatively affect the generalization capability of our method.

Accordingly, we will continue this work in the following directions. 1) We will employ both baseline and longitudinal MRI scans to predict clinical scores, by imputing those missing MR scans via deep learning algorithms (e.g., generative adversarial networks [57, 58]) for reliable prediction. Also, it is possible to determine which time-point is the most important in the disease progression, based on the complete (after computation) MRI scans for predicting clinical scores at all time-points. 2) Since clinical scores and class labels for a particular subject are highly associated, it is reasonable to develop a unified deep learning model for joint regression and classification. 3) It is desired to automatically identify both patch- and region-level discriminative locations in whole brain MRI, upon which both patch- and region-level feature representations can be jointly learned and fused in a data-driven manner to construct disease classification models. 4) We plan to design a domain adaptation method for dealing with the problem of different data distribution [59, 60], which is expected to further improve the generalization capability of the proposed network further.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we proposed a weakly-supervised deep neural network (wiseDNN) for predicting multiple types of clinical measures, based on subjects with baseline MRI data and incomplete ground-truth clinical scores. Specifically, we first pre-processed all MR images and identified disease-related anatomical landmarks via a landmark detection algorithm. Based on each landmark location, we extracted multi-scale patches centered at each landmark. Using image patches as input data, we developed a densely-connected neural network to simultaneously learn discriminative features of MRI and predict multiple clinical scores at four time-points. In our proposed network, a weighted loss function was developed to employ all available training subjects, even though some may lack complete ground-truth clinical scores at certain time-points. Experiments on 1,469 subjects from the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets suggest that the proposed wiseDNN method can effectively predict clinical scores at future time-points using baseline MRI data.
