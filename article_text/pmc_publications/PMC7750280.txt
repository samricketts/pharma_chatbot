Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is caused by genetic mutations, but whether factors impacting human genetic mutations are disease-specific remains elusive. Given two factors associated with high mutation rates, we reviewed how many disease-susceptible genes match with (i) proximity to telomeres or (ii) high adenine and thymine (A + T) content in human CH as compared to other disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). We extracted genomic information using a genome data viewer. Importantly, 98 of 108 genes causing CH satisfied (i) or (ii), resulting in &gt;90% matching rate. However, such a high accordance no longer sustained as we checked two factors in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and/or familial Parkinson’s disease (fPD), resulting in 84% and 59% matching, respectively. A disease-specific matching of telomere proximity or high A + T content predicts causative genes of CH much better than neurodegenerative diseases and other CNS conditions, likely due to sufficient number of known causative genes (n = 108) and precise determination and classification of the genotype and phenotype. Our analysis suggests a need for identifying genetic basis of both factors before human clinical studies, to prioritize putative genes found in preclinical models into the likely (meeting at least one) and more likely candidate (meeting both), which predisposes human genes to mutations.

1. Introduction

Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) comprises one of the most common childhood brain disorders (Dewan et al., 2018) (~1 in 1000 worldwide births (Dewan et al., 2018; Isaacs et al., 2019)). CH, in which genetic variants are involved, may occur alone (non-syndromic) or as part of a syndrome with multiple anomalies (Zhang et al., 2006). If left untreated, hydrocephalus is fatal. The mainstay of treatments is surgical, through shunt insertion and a combination of endoscopic ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (Dewan and Naftel, 2017; Kulkarni et al., 2018; Vinchon et al., 2012). CH results in extremely poor neurological outcomes (McAllister 2nd, 2012) that are expensive to manage surgically (~$2 billion annually) with 29–15% failure rates (Lim et al., 2018; Ravindra et al., 2015; Wright et al., 2016).

Etiologically, CH is associated with developmental abnormalities such as genetic mutations linked to ciliopathies, neural tube defects, spina bifida, myelomeningocele, and exencephaly/anencephaly, while that with acquired form involves ischemia/hypoxia, hemorrhage, infection, trauma, and brain tumors. Collectively, all forms of hydrocephalus in children show hallmarks such as ventriculomegaly. The cause of this ventriculomegaly is claimed to be multi-factorial: excess CSF production, obstruction of CSF pathways, impaired CSF outflow, and/or imbalance of production and reabsorption at subarachnoid granulation (Ballabh, 2014; Bassan, 2009; Bateman, 2008; Bhattathiri et al., 2006; Garton et al., 2016; Kazan et al., 2005; Koschnitzky et al., 2018; Limbrick Jr. et al., 2010; Mbabazi-Kabachelor et al., 2019; McAllister 2nd, 2012; Murphy et al., 2002; Osterman et al., 2015; Perdaens et al., 2018; Radic et al., 2015; Rekate, 2007; Robinson, 2012; Romero et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2019; Shimada et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2006). Recent studies have identified that increases in the mutation rates of more than 100 distinct genes contribute directly to one or more of these causative factors, as well as the aforementioned developmental abnormalities, thus insinuating a strong correlation with the development of CH (Belal and Al Menabawy, 2017; de Paola et al., 2019; Fransen et al., 1995; Furey et al., 2018a; Furey et al., 2018b; Gable et al., 2019; Huh et al., 2009; Kousi and Katsanis, 2016; Rachel et al., 2015; Rowitch et al., 1999; Shim et al., 2019).

More specifically, a recent whole exome sequencing (WES) study suggests that CH results from impaired neurogenesis, leading to abnormal CSF drainage or obstruction of CSF flow (Furey et al., 2018b). One of the major neurodevelopmental pathways related with neurogenesis in CH is cilia/sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling (Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Rohatgi et al., 2007). SHH is highly expressed in neural stem cells of the developing cortex, including the radial glia, intermediate progenitors, and outer radial astrocytes (Britto et al., 2002; Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014; Han et al., 2008). The primary cilium, which is non-motile, is an essential organelle that mediates the SHH signaling. Using embryonic fibroblasts, it has been shown that when the ligand, SHH, binds to patched gene (PTCH) that blocks smoothened (SMO), SMO is released and translocates to cilia, which activates downstream signaling (Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Rohatgi et al., 2007). Mutations in a series of proteins that regulate the structure of cilia or SHH pathways have been implicated in CH as well. In a rat model of Meckel-Gruber Syndrome (MKS), mutated transmembrane protein 67 (TMEM67) resulted in CH with elongated primary cilia (Shim et al., 2019). The TMEM67 gene encodes for Meckelin, a protein that functions in centriole migration to the apical membrane and formation of the primary cilium (Abdelhamed et al., 2015). ZCCHC8, the zinc finger CCHC-type domain containing 8 protein, which is reported to interact with the TR component (a non-coding RNA) of telomerase, has been shown to cause CH as well (Gable et al., 2019). Interestingly, ZCCHC8−/− mice showed significant upregulations of transmembrane proteins (e.g. TMEM116) and cilia-regulating genes (e.g. ccdc33) (Gable et al., 2019).

However, despite these neuroanatomical and clinical findings, as well as attempts to treat CH surgically, there is no effective cure for this disease. Moreover, the process by which mutations in TMEM67 and ZCCHC8 have occurred in their chromosomes— affecting cilia and SHH pathways—is largely unknown. Thus, an attempt to elucidate the mechanism underlying these high mutation rates is vitally important, thereby providing valuable insight into the root cause for CH, as well as likely leading to a more accurate diagnosis. To this end, we tested how many causative genes of CH meet the following two criteria: i) proximity to a telomere and ii) high A + T content. These two factors have been associated with a high mutation rate—causing genetic diseases (Nusbaum et al., 2006) such as CH—as indicated previously. We further tested whether genes causing other genetic disorders of the CNS would meet (i) or (ii) at a rate comparable to CH, in order to determine if these criteria provide a clear indication of genes causing neurological disorders.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Database and open access software

The literature survey was centered on CH and associated genes. We used PubMed database. During the literature survey, we also utilized the publicly open genome data viewer (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/gdv/), Pubmed database of nucleotide accession number (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/) and GC content calculators to obtain A + T content ((www.endmemo.com/bio/gc.php) and/or (https://www.biologicscorp.com/tools/GCContent/)).

2.2. Data plot and statistical methods

Prism was used to plot a bar graph and box and violin plot of the data obtained during analysis with genome data viewer. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (version 8, GraphPad Software Inc.). Normal distribution of the data was confirmed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test (α &lt; 0.05). A two-sided unpaired t-test was used for comparison of two different groups, unless stated differently. Tukey’s multiple comparisons test following one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of more than two groups. The difference between data sets was considered significant at P &lt; 0.05; P values are identified in the figures and legends as *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01, ***P &lt; 0.005.

3. Results

3.1. Most cases of CH belong to a type of neural tube defects

Our first question was how phenotypes of TMEM67 mutant rats (Shim et al., 2019), which were reported recently, might be linked to pediatric patients we studied previously (Shim et al., 2013). We reanalyzed the data (Shim et al., 2013) and sorted them based on the diagnosis. Interestingly, among seventy individual data points (31 controls &amp; 35 children with hydrocephalus included; 4 babies with tumors excluded), more patients were diagnosed as non-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus as compared to PHH. Importantly, 40% of neonatal hydrocephalus at age ≤ 3 yr belongs to a broad classification of neural tube defects: spina bifida &amp; hydrocephalus (23%), myelomeningocele &amp; hydrocephalus (13%), and encephalocele &amp; hydrocephalus (3%) (Fig. 1A). We then sorted the data by age (Fig. 1B). We found a significant number of patients belonged to ‘Not PHH’ such as CH, while ‘PHH’ occupied 26% of all patients. In the cohort of ‘age younger than 3 years’, encephalocele (Shim et al., 2019) was found in the ‘Not PHH’ group. This suggests a linkage to mutations in ciliopathy-related genes (Abdelhamed et al., 2015; Shim et al., 2019; Taulman et al., 2001). The aforementioned diagnosis by clinicians also highlighted the significance of CH associated with a form of spina bifida reported in Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) (Carter et al., 2012; Leitch et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2006) and our recent studies concerning TMEM67 defects (Shim et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2006). However, this diagnosis alone for pediatric patients was insufficient to uncover rationale of a high mutation rate in CH. Even in this single center study, we noticed that spina bifida (23%) was as frequent as PHH (26%) (Fig. 1A–B).

In all ages studied, male-female ratio was almost equal when sorted into control vs. hydrocephalus (Shim et al., 2013). As patients with hydrocephalus were further divided into PHH and ‘Not PHH’, however, there were more females in non-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus and fewer female patients in PHH (Fig. 1C). We then asked how abnormal neurogenesis was proposed as a cause of CH in recent literatures (Furey et al., 2018a; Rodriguez and Guerra, 2017). Previously (Shim et al., 2016), we reported that trajectories of doublecortin (DCX)-expressing young neurons in hydrocephalus were different in TMEM67−/− mutants as compared to WT during neonatal period (postnatal day 17, P17). A disorganized and widespread GFAP+ cells in the vicinity of radially and tangentially migrating neural progenitors in hydrocephalus is consistent with several previous studies by others (Doetsch and Alvarez-Buy 11a, 1996; Doetsch et al., 2002; Sawamoto et al., 2006; Shim et al., 2016) (Bothwell et al., 2019). In breeding animals, it has come to our attention that TMEM67−/− rats at P12 die in less than 10 days (~P21), even if many young neurons migrate postnatally in the presence of CH (Shim et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2006).

3.2. TMEM67 mutations detected in almost all exons of MKS and BBS patients with CH

It was not until recently that the spatial status of TMEM67 had been demonstrated in the ciliary zone close to basal body along with tectonicl, tectonic2, and Cc2d2a/MKS6, which collectively form a transition zone complex (Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015). In the DNA sequencing of five individuals with MKS, three types of mutations—namely, frameshift (exon 3 &amp; exon6), splice site (exon 9 &amp; exon 15), and missense mutation (exon 11)—were associated with neurological (encephalocele and Dandy Walker malformation), renal (polycystic kidney), and hepatic (fibrosis and ductal plate malformation) phenotypes (Smith et al., 2006). Using Wistar polycystic kidney (Wpk) rats, a missense mutation in exon 12 of TMEM67 has been shown, which results in a gene-dose dependent neurological and renal phenotype consistent with the aforementioned clinical report (Iannicelli et al., 2010). Specifically, hemorrhage in the dorsomedial subarachnoid space at birth, encephalocele-like protrusion, and late-onset hydrocephalus during adulthood were reported in TMEM67 heterozygous mutants, while the affected phenotype exhibited early-onset CH, polycystic kidney, and neonatal mortality before weaning age. This was observed with 100% penetrance of hydrocephalus in Wpk rats with TMEM67 homozygous mutant alleles (Shim et al., 2019). As pointed out recently, in comparison with twelve cases of MKS human fetuses in a wider ethnic background (United States, France, Italy, Algeria, and Morocco) than the prior report with limited ethnic identities (Oman and Pakistan) (Smith et al., 2006), there is no overt hepatic phenotype in the rat model of TMEM67 mutations (Iannicelli et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2019). As found in extra-renal organs, these TMEM67+/− rats developed late-onset hydrocephalus (Shim et al., 2019). Moreover, increasing evidence (Table S1)(Dempsey et al., 2017; Deveault et al., 2011; Doherty et al., 2010; Parisi, 2009) suggests that the correlation of genotype-phenotype is not simple and that TMEM67-involved MKS shares clinical features with Jourbert syndrome (JS), COACH syndrome, and BBS (Iannicelli et al., 2010; Leitch et al., 2008).

3.3. ZCCHC8 gene, whose KO mice develop CH, is in the vicinity of its telomere

The zinc finger CCHC-type domain containing 8 protein (ZCCHC8) is a component of the nuclear exosome targeting complex. Gable and colleagues recently showed that ZCCHC8 is required for the maturation of TR, a component of telomerase that is a specialized non-coding RNA (also known as TERC). They uncovered two distinct RNA dysregulation disease phenotypes caused by partial and complete loss of nuclear RNA exosome targeting. Genotypically, ZCCHC8+/− mice displayed lung disease, similar to human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis related with defects in telomere length, while ZCCHC8−/− mice exhibited abnormal neurogenesis during embryonic development and CH in adulthood. The authors have claimed that hydrocephalus in ZCCHC8−/− mice is reminiscent of human mutation carriers with intellectual disability, although the presence of hydrocephalus in patients of that type has not been reported (Gable et al., 2019). Interestingly, transmembrane proteins (TMEMs) are upregulated in the RNA transcriptome analysis of ZCCHC8−/− mice, but whether or not they are related with cilia remains undetermined. Specifically, TMEM151a, TMEM151b, TMEM253, and TMEM116 were upregulated in their RNA-seq. Analysis. None of these four TMEMs have yet been shown to localize in the ciliaiy transition zone. Their interpretation of the mechanism by which CH develops in this model is built on three premises: 1) ZCCHC8 expression is low in the brain but detected in ependymal cells, 2) three TMEMs transcripts, one of which may be related with the ciliary transition zone, were upregulated, and 3) genes reported to regulate motile cilia, cede family proteins, were upregulated. Among TMEMs they uncovered, ‘the ciliary body’ connected to the dorsal iris of the eye, in which TMEM116 was highly expressed, could be considered a potential link to the cilia of the central nervous system (CNS) (Sousounis et al., 2013). Thus, clarification is warranted if, for example, TMEM116 upregulated in ZCCHC8−/− mice with CH is detected as one of transition zone complexes, similar to TMEM67, in conjunction with ‘ependymal’ ZCCHC8, which they briefly described (Gable et al., 2019).

3.4. An outline of genes causing CH

In the prior section, we compared two recently reported genes evoking CH. Similarly, here, we reviewed more than 100 genes causing CH and summarized the basic information (Table 1). Here, we found that 108 genes causing CH might be classified into four categories: 1) neurulation, 2) cilia, 3) syndromes, and 4) others. For more detailed classification, readers are recommended to visit the references (REF) listed in Table 1.

While this classic summary of genotype-phenotype (Table 1) is appreciated, we additionally asked which fundamental characteristics of these genes are associated with mutations leading to CH. To find the answer to this question, we first examined the human ZCCHC8 gene using the genome data viewer. Interestingly, ZCCHC8 is located very close to its telomere (&lt;50 Mbp) on chromosome 12. We also found that the human TMEM67 gene is located slightly farther than 50 Mbp from its telomere on human chromosome 8 (Table S2).

3.5. Mapping of select genes on human chromosomes: I. proximity to telomeres

During literature surveys of SHH signaling related with CH, we found that a gene located adjacent to a telomere in a chromosome interacts with genes located in the same chromosome and can also affect the expression of genes that are further apart. For example, when the ligand SHH (in chromosome 7) binds to its receptor, PTCH1 (in chromosome 9) that blocks SMO (in chromosome 7), SMO is released and translocated to cilia to activate the downstream signaling (Goetz and Anderson, 2010; Rohatgi et al., 2007). Here, both SHH (q36.3) and SMO (q32.1) are located at the long arm of chromosome 7. If two genes are in the same chromosome, their genetic linkage can alter recombination frequency. Therefore, we sought a way to identify which chromosome has which gene, pinpointing where each gene lies on its chromosome via genetic mapping.

Previously, the biological basis for the apparently high mutation rate in human chromosome 8, on which TMEM67 is located, has been described. A group of colleagues led by Eric Lander have proposed that three factors are associated with high mutation rates, highlighting i) proximity to telomeres, ii) high recombination rate, and iii) high A + T content (Chimpanzee and Analysis, 2005; Hellmann et al., 2005; Nusbaum et al., 2006). Strictly speaking, a high recombination rate (Chimpanzee and Analysis, 2005; Hellmann et al., 2005; Nusbaum et al., 2006) is obtained when exchanged nucleotide sequences of F2 offspring from homologous recombination of FI parent chromosomes are discerned. However, if we apply the rule of thumb of 1 centimorgan (cM) ~1 million base pair (Mbp) (Hastbacka et al., 1992), then measuring the distance between two genes will allow the recombination frequency (Ritter et al., 1990) or rate (Nusbaum et al., 2006) to be calculated. As a result, we examined two of the three factors mentioned above—focusing on the position of a gene and its distal end locus of each arm on a chromosome where the telomere lies—using the following premise:

If recombination frequency (Ritter et al., 1990) is less than ( ≤) 50 cM, genes are linked: (1)

if recombination frequency is higher than 50 cM, genes are not linked, (2)

where 1 centimorgan (cM) 1 million base pair (Mbp) (Hastbacka et al., 1992).

First, we retrieved each transcript using the genome data viewer and checked the position in the short (p) or long (q) arm of the chromosome relative to the telomere (the distal end of the p or q arm depends on where a gene is located) of select genes readily known in clinical and animal studies of CH (Table S2)(Botfield et al., 2013). We found that three causative genes of CH located at chromosome X (L1CAM) and chromosome 12 (ZCCHC8 and MKS4/cep290) met the first condition of ‘proximity to telomeres’ within 50 Mbp (Nusbaum et al., 2006). Interestingly, we found that three other genes related with CH are also located within this proximity (&lt;50 Mbp) to their telomeres—namely, TMEM116, TRPV4, and decorin (DCN) (Bothwell et al., 2019; Gable et al., 2019). In addition, Orail, MYC, and IGF1, which mediate store-operated Ca2+ signaling (Miao et al., 2017), induction of pluripotency (Park et al., 2008), and ciliary signaling in embiyonic ventricular surface (Lehtinen et al., 2013), respectively, are located at less than 50 Mbp to telomeres of the q arm on either chromosome 8 or chromosome 12. Intriguingly, however, TMEM67 and BBS10—which are known to cause CH and BBS—are slightly farther than 50 Mbp from their telomeres (Forsythe and Beales, 2013; Forsythe et al., 2018; Shim et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2006). Inversely, GLI1, which is known to mediate SHH signaling (Swiderski et al., 2014), and alpha tubulin (TUBAB1) gene—a marker for tufts of cilia (Mirzadeh et al., 2008)—are clearly far from their telomeres. In comparison, WNT1 and LRRK2, both known to regulate PCP signaling (Bengoa-Vergniory and Kypta, 2015; Meng et al., 2015) and familial Parkinson’s disease (fPD) (Kluss et al., 2019), are much closer to the centromere (Fig. 2A) within chromosome 12 rather than the telomeres. Taken together, four genes known to cause CH or BBS (L1CAM, ZCCHC8, MKS4, and TMEM67) are noteworthy. However, an explanation other than ‘proximity to telomeres’ is sought to better correlate the genotype (mutations) with the reported phenotype in humans (CH or other syndromic diseases). Thus, we examined the % composition of guanine and cytosine (GC content) within all these gene transcripts to obtain the % composition of adenine and thymine (A + T content) (Nusbaum et al., 2006).

3.6. Mapping of 108 genes causing CH on human chromosomes: II. A + T content

The A + T content of 16 genes were obtained using a GC content calculator, after which we sorted the data by nucleotide size, in terms of full-length base pair number (bp). As is evident from Table S3, nucleotides longer than 6000 bp tended to show higher A + T content at &gt;60%, which is higher than the threshold of 59% as proposed previously (Nusbaum et al., 2006). However, as the size of the nucleotide shortens, A + T content becomes less consistent across CH-related genes located on chromosome X, chromosome 8, and chromosome 12 (Table S3). As the sets of genes in Table S3 are compared to those of Table S2, despite having low A + T content (≤59%), two classic and relatively new causative genes of CH—L1CAM and ZCCHC8—demonstrated exemplary proximity (≤50Mbp) to their telomeres. In contrast, high A + T content (&gt;59%) may have prevailed over insufficient proximity to telomeres in two marginally located genes, TMEM67 and BBS10. Although the select genes listed here may be a result of our unintended bias, TMEM67 and ZCCHC8, along with the aforementioned series of associated genes, have appeared to uncover that either proximity to telomeres or high A + T content might suffice to predict if human CH develops—based on CH found in mutant animals. To test this idea, we extended our analysis to 108 causative genes (4 in Table S2–S3 + 104 in Table S4) of CH, reported previously (Buysse et al., 2013; Belal and Al Menabawy, 2017; Chabas et al., 1995; de Paola et al., 2019; Fransen et al., 1995; Furey et al., 2018a; Furey et al., 2018b; Gable et al., 2019; Huh et al., 2009; Iliescu et al., 2011; Kibar et al., 2001; Konishi et al., 2020; Kousi and Katsanis, 2016; Liu et al., 2016b; Rachel et al., 2015; Rowitch et al., 1999; Shaheen et al., 2017; Shim et al., 2019; Sironen et al., 2011; Vogel et al., 2012; Wicker et al., 1991; Wild et al., 1997).

In assessing the list of 108 causative genes of CH in Tables S2–S4, we summarized the survey of the distance between each gene locus and its telomere, defining it as the first factor or F(i) (Fig. 2B). As we went through each of these genes with the genome data viewer, it became obvious that if a causative gene of CH is located on chromosome 22, the 2nd shortest chromosome in physical length (Morton, 1991), “distance to a telomere” will almost always be within a 50 Mbp reach. This technically fulfills the first factor, F(i), indicating a higher mutation rate (Nusbaum et al., 2006), though it is less assertive than that indicated by longer chromosomes. By examining the known length of all chromosomes (Morton, 1991) and our data, we found that human chromosomes 18 to 22 had an absolute length less than 100 Mbp, meaning that their genes were unlikely to be &gt;50 Mbp from the telomere, since the centromere is located between p- and q-arm (Fig. 2C), thereby easily meeting F (i). This implies that clinicians will have a different suggestion for patients with CH whose causative genes lie in chromosome 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and Y—because any gene within these short chromosomes will likely have a range of distance from its telomere within 50 Mbp (Fig. 2A–C).

3.7. Causative genes of CH: III. Proximity to telomeres vs. A + T content

To further test our idea, we obtained the specific A + T (Fig. 3A) content of all of the aforementioned genes reported to cause CH. These 108 causative genes were found in almost all of the chromosomes except three (chromosome 18, 20, 21). Although a majority of these genes had less than 59% A + T content (dashed vertical lines in Fig. 3B), 32 of 108 genes with A + T content &gt;59% (Fig. 3B; Table S2–S4). We defined this condition as the second factor or F(ii). When we counted the number of these factors to match with CH, &gt;90% of genes causing CH satisfied the proximity to telomeres (n = 92/108) or high A + T content (n = 32/108). Furthermore, 20% of known genes met F(i) and F(ii) alike, while less than 10% (10 of 108 genes) met neither F(i) nor F(ii) (Fig. 3C). This raises the possibility that the disease-specific success rate of the previously proposed factors successfully projects CH, regardless of the particular locus on a certain chromosome (e.g. 8p) (Nusbaum et al., 2006).

3.8. Genes causing CH uncovering the factor-nucleotide size relationship

During the survey of nucleotide base pairs of the 108 genes, data entries suggest that the full-length size of a gene, if it is larger than 6000 bp, likely leads to the said gene having high A + T content at &gt;59%. The Pearson coefficient (r = 0.24) suggests that there is a correlation (P = 0.01) between the full-length size and A + T content in CH (Fig. 4A–B). We further organized factors (i) and (ii) with respect to the base pair number (bp) of each gene, by grouping into three categories with an approximately equal number per sub-group at 1–3000 bp (n = 40), 3001–6000 bp (n = 39), and 6001–15,000 bp (n = 29), respectively (total N = 108 causative genes of CH; Table S2, S3, and S4). Statistical analysis suggests that there is no significant overall difference in proximity to telomeres with respect to the gene full-length size. However, pair-wise comparisons using Tukey’s post-hoc test after one-way ANOVA suggest that there is a significant difference (P = 0.0075) in A + T content with respect to the full-length size (bp) in the shortest and the longest gene group. Genes with a full-length size longer than 6000 bp have a 41% chance (12/29) of harboring A + T content at &gt;59%, compared to the two other groups with shorter sizes (20% and 24% chances for 1–3000 bp and ≥ 6001 bp group, respectively) (Fig. 4C–D).

3.9. Genes associated with AD

We next checked the position of the p or q arm of the chromosome relative to the telomere of 70 genes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Table S5)(Seshadri et al., 2010; Bird, 1993). In assessing these genes, we surveyed the distance between each gene locus and its telomere using the first factor, or F(i) (Fig. 5A). As we identified the 70 gene loci listed in Tables S5, it was evident that—in chromosomes of short physical length such as chromosome 19, 20, and 21—the “distance to a telomere” will almost always be within 50 cM, thereby fulfilling F(i). This is consistent with the previous result (Fig. 2B–C) above. Again, this confirms that clinicians can provide a convincing explanation for patients with AD whose susceptible genes lie on chromosome 19, 20, 21, 22 and Y—where mutations are highly likely due to the short chromosomal length (blue asterisk in Fig. 5A).

To further test our hypothesis, we obtained the A + T content (Fig. 5B) of genes reported to be susceptible to AD. The majority of genes susceptible to AD were distributed on chromosomes 2 and 19, forming a dense cluster. When we examined 70 genes of AD, 84% satisfied the proximity to telomeres (n = 53/70) or high A + T content (n = 8/70) conditions. Furthermore, 1 of these genes met both F(i) and F(ii), while less than 20% (11 of 70 genes) met neither F(i) nor F(ii) (Fig. 5C). This supports the idea that disease-specific matching of the previously proposed two factors can predict genetic disorders of the CNS—telomere proximity or A + T content might suffice to predict both diseases, although mismatch is higher for AD (84% matching) than CH (&gt;90% matching).

We then organized the factors (i) and (ii) with respect to the base pair number (bp) of each gene. Consistent with the previous analysis (Fig. 4), we grouped the genes into three categories: 1–3000 bp (n = 39), 3001–6000 bp (n = 22), and 6001–15,000 bp (n = 9), respectively (total N = 70 genes susceptible to AD; Table S5; Fig. 5D–D’). Statistical analysis suggests that there is no significant difference in proximity to telomeres with respect to the gene full-length size. However, pair-wise comparisons using Tukey’s post-hoc test after one-way ANOVA suggest that there is a significant difference (P = 0.031) in A + T content with respect to the full-length size (bp) in the shortest and the longest gene group. Genes with a full-length size longer than 6000 bp have a 33% chance (3/9) of having &gt;59% A + T content, compared to the two other groups with shorter sizes (3% and 14% chances for 1–3000 bp and ≥ 6001 bp group, respectively). (Fig. 5E–F).

3.10. Matching rate of two factors with other genetic diseases

We next analyzed the percentage of these two factors matching with familial Parkinson’s disease (fPD), since the series of causative genes was readily available: namely, PARK 1 to PARK 18. Using 17 genes of fPD identifiable via the genome data viewer, we found that less than 60% of genes associated with fPD satisfied either F(i) or F(ii) while no genes met F(i) and F(ii) at the same time. Inversely, we found that 41% of genes associated with fPD met neither proximity to telomeres nor high A + T content (Fig. 6A–C; Table S6)(Kumar et al., 2012; Le et al., 2003; Nichols et al., 2009). Statistical analysis suggests that there is no significant difference in proximity to telomeres with respect to the gene full-length size (Fig. 6D). Consistent with the previous assessment with CH, pair-wise comparisons using Tukey’s post-hoc test after one-way ANOVA indicate that A + T content of the fPD genes with molecular size higher than 6000 bp is significantly different than other groups (P &lt; 0.01). However, fPD genes with full-length size longer than 6000 bp have only a 20% chance (1/5) of having A + T content at &gt;59% while the two other groups of fPD genes showed a 0% likelihood (Fig. 6E).

Consistent with fPD, we found a similar trend of moderate success—an overall 62.5% matching rate—in other CNS genetic conditions including neurofibromatosis (NF), tuberous sclerosis (TSC), BBS, Huntington’s disease (HD) and malformations with agenesis of corpus callosum (cc) (Fig. 6F; Table S7)(Ferner and Gutmann, 2013; Hjortshoj et al., 2008; Ivanovski et al., 2018; Khalifa et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019; Ly and Blakeley, 2019; Meczekalski et al., 2013; Nishimura et al., 2004; Rius et al., 2018; Sathasivam et al., 2013; Sheffield et al., 2018; Siegler et al., 2018; Tsai et al., 2012; Tyburczy et al., 2015; Uytingco et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2011). Both tests of fPD and other CNS disease at ~60% matching rate were contrasted with the &gt;90% rate generated from the 108 genes of CH (Fig. 3C vs. Fig. 6C&amp;F). A mechanistic study elucidating disease-specific alterations of high mutation rates associated with proximity to telomeres and A + T content—as well as why CH demonstrates &gt;90% accuracy while other genetic conditions of the CNS remain at ~60%—is warranted.

4. Discussion

We checked the two factors of telomere proximity and DNA composition focusing on AT-rich sequences in CH, fPD, AD, and a group of other genetic diseases—including neurofibromatosis (NF), tuberous sclerosis (TSC), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and corpus callosum malformation (Fig. 1–6E and Fig. 6F). Chromosomal DNAs adjacent to telomeres are to some extent vulnerable to DNA damage or mutagenesis (Nusbaum et al., 2006). In this study, we considered this as being within 50 Mb from the chromosome ends (Nusbaum et al., 2006; Ritter et al., 1990). The threshold of 59% in A + T content is a genome-wide average reported in humans (Nusbaum et al., 2006). Telomeres, essentially characterized by a unique chromatin environment (Blasco, 2007), are composed of 3–20 kb of AT-rich repeats flanked by subtelomeric regions extending up to 300 kb into the chromosome (Misteli, 2014). In addition, tandem repeats of short GT-rich sequences are characteristic of almost all eukaryotic telomeres (McKnight and Shippen, 2004). Despite this repeated sequence and the number of repeats varying between species, human telomeres range in size from 2 to 50 kb and consist of 300–8000 precise repeats of the sequence CCCTAA/TTAGGG. Moreover, a common feature of all telomeres is the orientation of the G-rich strand. In all cases, this strand comprises the 3′-end of the chromosome, while its terminal part is single-stranded, generating a G-tail (Blackburn et al., 2006). It is also noted that genes in close proximity to telomeres are silenced due to the repressive nature of specific telomere-binding proteins such as heterochromatin (Misteli, 2014). The degree of repression declines with distance from the telomere, limited to ~100 kb (Kulkarni et al., 2010). Taken together, telomeres are the specialized mechanisms protecting chromosomes, since cells do not tolerate the presence of unprotected chromosome ends (McClintock, 1941)(O’Connor, 2008).

Our detailed analysis using the aforementioned two criteria associated with high mutation rate is primarily dedicated to CH (Fig. 2–4), AD (Fig. 5), and fPD (Fig. 6) because these diseases have multiple genes involved, rather than a small number of genes reported. We found that a genetic disease can have multiple genes with several types of mutations: i) point mutation, ii) indels, iii) transpositions, iv) inversions, v) nondisjunctions, and vi) changes in the ploidy level (Loewe and Hill, 2010). For instance, Down Syndrome is the most common genetic disorder by prevalence (1 in 1000 live births worldwide). But it is not single or multiple genes with type i (point mutation) through type v (nondisjunctions) mutations, but the presence of a third copy of chromosome 21 that causes this syndrome. In this situation (type vi—the ploidy level mutations) (Loewe and Hill, 2010), our analysis is inappropriate.

Previously, we characterized three different models of hydrocephalus starting from human CSF assays (Shim et al., 2016; Shim et al., 2013; Shim et al., 2019). Hence, our genomic analysis was centered on factors associated with high mutation rates (Nusbaum et al., 2006) in hydrocephalus resulting from genetic mutations. One of the critical physiological parameters determining the diagnosis of hydrocephalus is intracranial pressure (ICP) (Eide et al., 2010), which is associated with a rapid increase in head circumference or macrocephaly (Robinson et al., 2018), the most obvious sign of hydrocephalus in infants. Elevated ICP, a primary symptom manifested as macrocephaly, distinguishes neonatal hydrocephalus from similar types of the brain conditions with ventriculomegaly such as periventricular leukomalacia found in cerebral palsy (Albright et al., 2005; Limbrick Jr. and Park, 2006). However, a rise in ICP in hydrocephalus should not be confused with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or pseudotumor cerebri (Friedman and Jacobson, 2002). Interestingly, unlike the SLC12A7 gene as we surveyed in CH (Table 1), a splicing mutation in SLC12A3 gene is linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (Godefroid et al., 2006). This suggests that there might be a novel population of undiscovered genes causing intracranial hypertension in the absence of hydrocephalus.

Our projection of genes causing CH highlights distinct biological processes over time: neurogenesis and neurodegeneration. CH is found in children as an early onset, mostly. However, some forms of genetically driven hydrocephalus are late-onset and found in young adults as well. Thus, we thought that hydrocephalus from genetic mutations is not always as a result of birth defects, because a set of patients with NPH (usually found in elderly persons) is known to have hydrocephalus arising from genetic defects (Morimoto et al., 2019). As such, other than age, we have sought what other critical factors can better explain CH. Since CH is primarily a CNS disease related with ‘abnormal neurogenesis’ or ‘generation’ as recently proposed (Furey et al., 2018a), we enthralled the idea that a CNS disease associated with ‘degeneration’ could potentially provide a valuable comparison. Thus, familial PD (fPD) was chosen, since there are more than 15 genes so far defined as PARK family genes.

In our investigation of these familial genes for fPD, we analyzed the dataset and found that it might be more meaningful to compare CH and “PD” with another type of degenerative disorder to investigate where each disease stands from a low-to-high matching rate standpoint with respect to the two factors utilized in this study. Hence, we have additionally surveyed Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Surprisingly, AD was much more similar to CH than fPD was when comparing the matching rate using (i) proximity to telomeres and (ii) high A + T content—even though both AD and fPD are degenerative diseases of the CNS. Our interpretation is that genetic mutations that are highly associated with these two factors are sufficient to drive development of CH and AD in a similar manner. However, these factors might not be sufficient to explain the mutations detected in fPD, suggesting the involvement of ‘bigenic mechanisms’—such as environmental and genetic factors (Warner and Schapira, 2003). However, this observed discrepancy in fPD as compared to CH and/or AD does not exclude the possibility of acquired mutations (Veeriah et al., 2010) such as somatic mitochondrial DNA mutation (Coxhead et al., 2016).

Other than the two criteria tested in this study, linking a mutation to the disease through specific mediators might deepen our scientific understanding of the subject. For example, a more thorough evaluation of the phenotype revealing ‘hemorrhage’ in CH (Emmert et al., 2019; Shim et al., 2016; Shim et al., 2019) may shed light on mechanisms underlying PHH. Similarly, finding a phenotype of ‘age-related loss or toxin-induced injury in neural connectivity (Luk et al., 2012; Henderson et al., 2019)’ along the nigrostriatal pathway might better explain how genetic and environmental factors alike can contribute to the pathogenesis of fPD.

5. Conclusions

Per the criteria of &lt;50 Mbp proximity to telomeres and A + T content at &gt;59%, the TMEM67 gene is associated with mutations causing CH due primarily to a high A + T content of 64% with a marginal proximity to telomeres. In contrast, the ZCCHC8 gene is associated with mutations causing CH due primarily to proximity to telomeres.

Our results using the first factor suggests that causative genes located on chromosomes 18 to 22 more likely achieve a proximity to telomeres (&lt;50 Mbp) due to short chromosomal length.

Factor-nucleotide size relationships suggest that the full-length size of a gene causing CH, if it is longer than 6000 bp, likely shows high A + T content at &gt;59%.

If genes causing genetic diseases with mutations do not satisfy the two criteria or the factors according to the previous suggestions (Nusbaum et al., 2006): Causative mutations may be found in a region that is less likely to be mutated or

Off-target effects (mutations) might dominate in an animal study or

During evolution, genes causing CH in animals have not survived in humans.
