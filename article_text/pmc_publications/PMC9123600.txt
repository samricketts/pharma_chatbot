Background:

The differentiation of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) by clinical criteria can be inaccurate. The volumetric quantification of clinically available magnetic resonance (MR) brain scans may facilitate early diagnosis of these neurodegenerative dementias.

Objective:

To determine if volumetric quantification of brain MR imaging can identify persons with bvFTD from EOAD.

Methods:

3D T1MR brain scans of 20 persons with bvFTD and 45 with EOAD were compared using Neuroreader to measure subcortical, and lobar volumes, and Volbrain for hippocampal subfields. Analyses included: 1) discriminant analysis with leave one out cross-validation; 2) input of predicted probabilities from this process into a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis; and 3) Automated linear regression to identify predictive regions.

Results:

Both groups were comparable in age and sex with no statistically significant differences in symptom duration. bvFTD had lower volume percentiles in frontal lobes, thalamus, and putamen. EOAD had lower parietal lobe volumes. ROC analyses showed 99.3% accuracy with Neuroreader percentiles and 80.2% with subfields. The parietal lobe was the most predictive percentile. Although there were differences in hippocampal (particularly left CA2-CA3) subfields, it did not add to the discriminant analysis.

Conclusion:

Percentiles from an MR based volumetric quantification can help differentiate between bvFTD from EOAD in routine clinical care. Use of hippocampal subfield volumes does not enhance the diagnostic separation of these two early-onset dementias.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) dementia are the most common causes of neurodegenerative dementia among persons in their 50s and early 60s [1, 2]. Both disorders can have a high rate of misdiagnosis when based on clinical grounds only. One study of patients diagnosed with bvFTD by community clinicians found that 60% were misdiagnosed according to neurological specialists [3]. Another study of 40 persons with neuropathologically confirmed EOAD showed a 23% misdiagnosis, of whom 29% were incorrectly identified as having bvFTD [4]. Potential reasons for misdiagnosing these two early-onset dementias are the occurrence of a behavioral/dysexecutive variant of EOAD [5] and the presence of early memory impairment among patients with bvFTD.

Given overlapping ages of onset with bvFTD and EOAD as well as the high rate of misdiagnosis in both disorders, clinically available methods for improved diagnostic accuracy are crucial [6]. Whereas positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG), amyloid, or tau radioligands is more specific in facilitating the diagnosis of these disorders, unlike clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, PET may not be available, accessible, or considered early in the clinical evaluation. A systematic review found that morphometric MRI can be an early diagnostic marker of bvFTD [7]. The addition of volumetric quantification can thus improve the amount of diagnostic information obtained from brain MRIs. Clinically available MRI analysis methods now employ automated volumetric quantification that can be done in most medical imaging centers [8]. Neuroreader is one program; it is FDA cleared and had been applied to other clinical conditions, such as traumatic brain injury [9].

We applied this program in individuals with bvFTD and EOAD under the hypothesis that this approach would yield improved diagnostic differentiation of these two disorders. Because of the importance of hippocampal subfields in AD dementia and some genetic forms of bvFTD, a further hypothesis was that hippocampal subfield analysis through a research program called Volbrain [10], would also demonstrate diagnostic value in separating bvFTD from EOAD.

METHODS

Participants

This was a retrospective study conducted in adherence to the STARD guidelines for diagnostic accuracy studies [11]. Research participants were &lt; 65 years of age who presented to specialty dementia clinics and underwent extensive evaluations under UCLA institutional review board (IRB) approved studies (IRB#16-000496, IRB#16-001491, and IRB#10-001097) with related informed consent obtained from both participants and their caregivers. The diagnoses were established by Clinical Criteria and confirmed by FDG PET [12, 13]. As part of the assessment, all participants underwent an extensive history and neurological examination conducted by a specialist in dementia (MFM). On this examination, none of the patients had a history of daily cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, or REM behavior disorder, and on neurological examination none of the participants had parkinsonism or other abnormal findings beyond the mental status evaluation.

We recruited participants seen over a four year period, including 20 who met International Consensus Criteria for probable bvFTD [12] and another 45 who met criteria for clinically probable AD [13] with an age of onset of &lt; 65 years [1, 14]. Per Rascovsky et al. [12], imaging findings consistent with bvFTD are a requirement to move from possible to probable bvFTD. Neuroimaging support for EOAD versus bvFTD participants in our study was based on patterns of hypometabolism on FDG-PET; specifically temporal-parietal hypometabolism on PET for EOAD and fronto-temporal hypometabolism in bvFTD [15]. Additionally, all the participants in this study had an overall equivalent level of functional impairment characterized by a deficit in one or more instrumental activities [16] but preservation of the six basic activities of daily living [17]. Symptom duration in number of years from onset to time of scan was also obtained as part of the evaluation. There were no indeterminate results or missing data among the variables from the participants evaluated in this study. The flowchart of study participants is presented in Fig. 1.

Structural MRI

Quantified MRI brain volumes were done for this study and not as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation. Each individual underwent brain MRI including a 3D volumetric T1 sequence on either a 1.5 or 3.0 Tesla Siemens Scanner. The 3T protocol was on a Siemens MAGNETOM Trio MRI scanner with acquisition of high-resolution T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE sequences with the following parameters: 192 × 256 matrix and TR = 1,900 ms, TE = 4.38 ms, TI = 1,100 ms, flip angle 15°, voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. The 1.5T protocol was done on a Siemens Avanto scanner on which an MPRAGE was also obtained with the following parameters: T1-weighted sequences (256 × 256 matrix; TR = 2000 ms; TE = 2.89 ms; TI = 900 ms; flip angle = 40°; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3). Scans were then analyzed with two software programs for regional and subregional volume quantification: Neuroreader, an FDA cleared volumetric program described in previous work [9, 18], and Volbrain [10]. With Neuroreader, a total of 45 brain structures were quantified including the hippocampus, lobar structures, subcortical regions (thalamus, caudate, etc.), ventral diencephalon, midbrain, ventricular, and white matter volumes with an atlas-based segmentation, also detailed previously [18]. Total gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes were additionally computed. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was summed from GM+WM+CSF to help calculate each brain volume as a fraction of TIV. Thus each Neuroreader analysis produces the following results: 1) regional brain volume in ml; 2) region of interest as a fraction of TIV; 3) the number of standard deviations from the normative database (NR index); 4) the number for standard deviations from the mean scaled between −2 and+2 (Z-score); and 5) percentile of comparison to the normative database was drawn from cognitively normal controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [18]. No adverse events were reported in the clinical evaluations, or the brain MRI scans.

Having determined regional brain volumes, we then sought to compute hippocampal subfield volumes. As no software currently exists for producing these volumes with FDA clearance, we used Volbrain, a specialized research software for measuring hippocampal subfields [10]. To do this we converted the de-identified DICOM images into NIFTI files for each scan using dcm2guii (https://people.cas.sc.edu/rorden/mricron/dcm2nii.html). We applied Volbrain, Winterburn method, on the NIFTI files for each individual for quantification of the following hippocampal subfields [19]: 1) CA1, 2) CA2/CA3, 3) CA4/Dentate Gyrus (DG), 4) strata radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare (SR/SL/SM), and 5) subiculum. Each subfield volume was expressed as a fraction of TIV. Volbrain structures were compared to normal data were derived from the IXI cohort (https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/) and were also adjusted for age, sex, and head size [10].

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were done using IBM SPSS (Version 26, Armonk NY). The regional brain volume percentiles and hippocampal subfield volumes were compared across groups using a two-sample t-test. For statistically significant results, effect sizes were computed using a Cohen’s d statistic [20]. Additional analyses included: 1) separate discriminant analyses [21] for Neuroreader and Volbrain metrics with leave one out cross validation done to guard against overfitting [22]; 2) input of predicted probabilities from these analyses into an ROC analysis with clinical diagnosis of the reference standard; and 3) Automated linear regression to identify specific regions of interest that optimized diagnostic delineation between bvFTD and EOAD. We also repeated these analyses using both Neuroreader and Volbrain metrics to determine if there was any additive diagnostic delineation. For analyses with both types of software (Neuroreader and Volbrain), multiple comparisons were accounted for using false discovery rate (FDR) with the method of Benjamini &amp; Hochberg [23].

RESULTS

In comparing the bvFTD and EOAD groups, there were no statistically significant differences in age at presentation or sex. Both types of dementia had a moderate degree of global cognitive impairment on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) with the EOAD persons having a statistically significant lower average score. Table 1 details demographic and global cognitive scoring data with statistical analyses. While cognitive impairment was moderately worse in the EOAD group, symptom duration was not statistically significant.

Table 2A shows comparisons of Neuroreader percentile metrics in bvFTD and EOAD. Individuals with bvFTD had a larger number of regions with statistically significant lower percentiles than those with EOAD. With EOAD, lower percentiles were seen most prominently in the parietal lobes (see Table 2A). Though bvFTD had a lower rate of 3.0T scans compared to EOAD, volumetric differences between these groups did not vary as a function of field strength (1.5 or 3.0 Tesla) with detectable statistically significant differences as evaluated by a separate statistical interaction. After applying FDR correction for multiple comparisons, all statistically significant regions persisted except for the left occipital lobe.

Table 2B shows comparisons of Volbrain Hippocampal subfield volumes in bvFTD and EOAD. When correcting for multiple comparisons with FDR, there was persistence of statistically significant results for CA2-CA3 and CA4-dentate gyrus structures. These volumetric differences across hippocampal subfields also did not vary as a function of field strength with detectable statistically significant differences as evaluated by a separate statistical interaction.

The discriminant analysis of Neuroreader regional percentiles showed 84.6% correct classification with leave one out cross validation. The predicted probabilities from this model resulted in a 99.3% accuracy in the ROC (95% CI: 96.3–100%). Sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 95%. These findings are shown in Fig. 2.

Based on the results of the automated linear regression analysis, the most predictive regional percentiles distinguishing bvFTD from EOAD, in rank order, are: 1) left parietal lobe (r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001); 2) right temporal lobe (r = 0.21, p &lt; 0.001); 3) right thalamus (r = 0.12, p = 0.003); 4) left frontal lobe (r = 0.11, p = 0.004); 5) left cerebellum (r = 0.08, p = 0.01).

The discriminant analysis based upon the Volbrain hippocampal subfields produced a correct classification of 82.3% and a cross validated accuracy of 66.1%. The predicted probabilities from this model resulted in an ROC curve with 80.2% accuracy (95% CI: 66–94%). This ROC curve is shown in Fig. 3. Sensitivity is 83.3% and specificity is 64%. Aggregating hippocampal subfield volumes with Neuroreader volumes in the same discriminant model did not improve diagnostic accuracy.

DISCUSSION

This work analyzed data from two volumetric software programs in the diagnostic separation of bvFTD and EOAD. Such software is particularly needed for diagnosing individual patients, rather than comparing diagnostic groups [24]. The differences in regional brain volume percentiles between bvFTD and EOAD had high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing between these two early-onset dementias. The strength of this study is the unique comparison of bvFTD to EOAD with FDA cleared software, that is clinically available and applicable in most imaging centers. The further supplementation with research grade hippocampal subfield volumes adds potential insight into the diagnostic value of subfield segmentation. Atrophy detection with automated volumetrics will remain important for clinical practice especially given the lack of sensitivity for visual evaluations compared to quantification [25–27]. Furthermore, use of percentiles by comparison to normative databases can aid clinicians in readily identifying brain atrophy while assisting in the communication of these results to patients.

While all patients referred for cognitive impairment, including those with suspected bvFTD and EOAD, receive brain MRI per standard guidelines [28], the use of MRI in these cases is traditionally focused on ruling out structural lesions that may cause dementia rather than identifying neurodegenerative dementias such as bvFTD or EOAD. Programs such as this may increase clinical utility due to their ability to individually compare a single patient brain scan to a normal database and provide percentile evaluations of regional atrophy. Yet, among 134 patients referred for clinical evaluation for bvFTD [2], the additional use of MRI improved the clinical diagnostic sensitivity from 36.5% to 63.5%. A major focus of differentiating bvFTD and EOAD by MRI has been the presence of hippocampal or mesial temporal atrophy in AD [29]. However, visual ratings of mesial temporal, including hippocampal, with the 5-point Scheltens scale in this study did not show acceptable results with only 32% diagnostic accuracy in delineating EOAD from bvFTD. Another study that also used this same scale showed improved but not very high area under the curve of 75% with a sensitivity of 64% [30], and a multiparametric MR study that combined cortical thickness with diffusion tensor imaging was able to distinguish a group of 62 persons with EOAD from 27 with bvFTD with sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 76%, and accuracy of 82% [31]. These studies lacked clinical applicability due to limitation of the software used for image analysis to research settings. This is a critical gap that our study addresses.

While both bvFTD and EOAD affect the temporal lobes, this spatial confluence of these conditions generated interest in how hippocampal subfields could help delineate these two disorders. The unexpected higher degree of hippocampal subfield atrophy in the bvFTD group compared to the EOAD is notable, especially given the otherwise lack of statistically significant differences in the temporal lobe percentiles. This apparent difference may be due to the relative hippocampal sparing nature of EOAD compared to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) [14]. An investigation, using Freesurfer to define hippocampal subfield volumes, has demonstrated lower left CA1 volumes in EOAD as compared to LOAD [32]. In addition, among genetic forms of bvFTD compared to healthy controls, there may be significant atrophy of many subfields, including CA1-4, dentate gyrus, and presubiculum/subiculum [33]. Our study indicates that bvFTD particularly impacts input into the CA3 hippocampal subfield, an area involved in completing and consolidating declarative memory. To our knowledge, the work presented here is the first study using Volbrain hippocampal subfields to compare bvFTD and EOAD. Using both Volbrain subfields and Neuroreader volumes in the same discriminant model did not improve diagnostic accuracy. However, future research should continue to investigate hippocampal subfield volumes in the clinical differentiation of these two dementias.

There are some potential limitations of this study. First, the inclusion of participants with a moderate level of cognitive impairment is a potential limitation as it could blunt the diagnostic value of hippocampal subfields volumes for cases with milder cognitive impairment. The early-onset dementia patients included in this study were referred to a specialty clinic and were already in moderate stages of their disease. This limitation is somewhat mitigated by the lack of any difference in the years of symptom duration. Future work will also require longitudinal evaluations to show maximal benefit in a clinical population as progressive atrophy is more specific for neurodegenerative disease than cross sectional evaluations [34] Second, our sample size of bvFTD of n = 20 is relatively low and could bias our results by limiting the sensitivity of detecting other region that could distinguish this diagnosis from EOAD. Moreover, another potential limitation was the combination of both 1.5 and 3.0 T MR imaging data. We did not find that the detected group differences varied as a function of field strength, and prior literature has found that Neuroreader segmentation accuracy is equivalent across 1.5T and 3.0T [18]. Another study using Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data did not find a difference in tracking longitudinal atrophy with 1.5T versus 3.0T with a tensor based morphometry analysis [35]. Additionally, the Volbrain normal database is made from a combination of 1.5 and 3.0 MRI scans [36]. Finally, the lack of amyloid or tau biomarkers may raise concern about lack of certainly in our diagnoses and while this is an understandable concern, several points should be considered. First, CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau are not commonly available in clinical practice because of increased cost, invasiveness of lumbar puncture, and risk of overdiagnosis [37]. Thus, our study more closely reflects current clinical realities as opposed to AD clinical trials were CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau are common. Moreover, we confirmed diagnoses with brain FDG-PET, a recognized biomarker of neurodegeneration under the amyloidtau-neurodegeneration (ATN) conceptual framework [38]. Future studies can provide opportunity to add amyloid and tau biomarkers to test specific hypotheses related to these biomarkers, but this was not the focus of our study. The quantitative MRI approach we utilized will continue to have clinical relevance particularly given the high cost of amyloid brain PET, lack of insurance coverage for this method [39] compared to brain FDG-PET [40], and continued limited patient access to amyloid and tau tracers and CSF sampling.

In conclusion, the results of this study point to the potential clinical value of quantitative analysis of clinically available MRI images as part of the differential diagnosis of early-onset dementias. In conjunction with expert clinical evaluations, the application of volumetric quantification can be readily applied in most clinical settings and contribute to increasing diagnostic accuracy of bvFTD versus EOAD. With increasing numbers of brain volumes from clinical grade programs, there is even further potential for applying these data to artificial intelligence for improved diagnosis of individuals with neurodegenerative and other disorders [41].
