Psychotic symptoms are increasingly recognized as a distinguishing clinical feature in patients with dementia due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). Within this group, carriers of the C9orf72 repeat expansion are particularly prone to develop delusions and hallucinations. The present retrospective study sought to provide novel details about the relationship between FTLD-TDP pathology and the presence of psychotic symptoms during life. We found that FTLD-TDP subtype B was more frequent in patients with psychotic symptoms than in those without. This relationship was present even when corrected for the presence of C9orf72 mutation, suggesting that pathophysiological processes leading to the development of subtype B pathology may increase the risk of psychotic symptoms. Within the group of FTLD-TDP cases with subtype B pathology, psychotic symptoms tended to be associated with a greater burden of TDP-43 pathology in the white matter and a lower burden in lower motor neurons. When present, pathological involvement of motor neurons was more likely to be asymptomatic in patients with psychosis.

pmcIntroduction

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by progressive abnormalities of personality, behaviour and/or language with relative preservation of memory. FTD is the second most common type of early-onset dementia and is most commonly caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a heterogeneous group of pathologies that result in prominent atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes 1. FTLD is sub-classified based on the identity of the protein that accumulates in pathological inclusions in neurons and glia. The most common subtype of FTLD is characterized by cellular inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and is termed FTLD-TDP 1,2. In addition to FTLD, pathological TDP-43 inclusions have also been described in the vast majority of patients with sporadic and inherited forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 3. Clinical overlap between FTD and ALS 4,5 and involvement of extra-motor areas by TDP-43 pathology in clinically pure ALS cases have been well documented 6,7. This supports the concept that FTLD-TDP and ALS-TDP lie at the ends of a disease spectrum characterized by clinical, genetic and pathological commonalities.

FTLD-TDP can be subdivided into four or five main histological subtypes based on the type, morphology, neocortical laminar and subcortical distribution of TDP-43 immunoreactive pathological changes 8–11. These neuropathological subtypes show remarkable correlations with specific genetic mutations and clinical phenotypes 2. The most frequent subtypes of FTLD-TDP are A, B, C and mixed A+B 8,12–14; the latter designation being given to cases that show typical features of both types A and B 14,15. According to current criteria, 8,14 FTLD-TDP subtype A is characterized by moderate to abundant compact neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI), moderate to abundant short dystrophic neurites (DN) and occasional neuronal intranuclear inclusions, all concentrated in neocortical layer II. Subtype B shows moderate to abundant, predominantly granular, NCI in all neocortical layers, while type C typically exhibits many long thick DN. Although consensus diagnostic criteria for each subtype are published and widely applied 8, the interrater agreement is variable 16. This variability is partly explained by methodological issues associated with immunohistochemical procedures 16.

In addition to the neocortical features described above, each subtype has characteristic subcortical patterns of involvement 15,17. Subtype A is associated with abundant thread pathology in white matter and subcortical grey matter regions and delicate TDP-43 threads in CA1. Subtype B cases show a predominance of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI) in the cerebral white matter, diffuse granular NCI in subcortical grey matter and, most characteristically, NCI in lower motor neurons (LMN). Subtype C has minimal involvement of subcortical structures apart from compact Pick body-like NCI in the hippocampal dentate layer and the striatum 15,17. Inclusion of these subcortical features may help disambiguate or confirm mixed features in cases with borderline or mixed neocortical patterns 16,18,19 or in cases due to C9orf72 mutations, the latter of which are known to be more difficult to subtype 15.

Notably, each FTLD-TDP subtype has prototypic clinical and genetic phenotypes that, if understood at the pathophysiological level, could yield important insights into the unique cellular types and processes affected in each of these pathological subtypes. For example, patients with FTLD-TDP subtype A are more prone to develop non-fluent primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) and/or parkinsonism and are genetically linked to mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) 2. Subtype B cases are typically associated with ALS in the context of bvFTD and are genetically linked to hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene 2, while subtype C cases have a strong association with the semantic variant of PPA (svPPA) and are usually sporadic 2.

Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and/or hallucinations are generally uncommon in the FTD patient population, affecting less than 10% of all FTD cases 20,21. Nonetheless, certain subgroups of patients with FTD, including those with underlying TDP-43 pathology 22,23 and those carrying the C9orf72 repeat expansion24–30, have a much higher prevalence of these symptoms, with some reports describing psychotic symptoms in up to 50% of patients with C9orf72 mutations 24,25,28,31. Furthermore, the presence of hallucinations has been found to be a discriminatory feature between FTLD-TDP and other FTLD pathologies 32.

While the precise neuroanatomical correlates of psychotic symptoms are not fully elucidated, neuroimaging studies using different modalities converge onto several regions of interest. Structural MRI studies have shown that multiple cortical regions including bilateral prefrontal, temporoparietal, superior temporal, inferior frontal areas and limbic cortex are affected in patients with primary psychotic disorders and with psychotic symptoms in C9orf72 mutation carriers 33,34. Subcortically, patients with primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia have been shown to have smaller hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and nucleus accumbens, as well as larger pallidum and lateral ventricle volumes 35. Finally, evaluations using diffusion MRI have also shown white matter abnormalities in psychotic disorders, suggesting potential abnormalities in brain structural connectivity 36.

Given the higher incidence of psychotic symptoms in patients with FTLD-TDP, we sought to further define the relationship between neocortical FTLD-TDP subtypes and their associated subcortical pathology and psychotic symptomatology. To this end, the presence of delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia in retrospectively reviewed clinical charts of autopsy-confirmed FTLD-TDP cases was correlated with neocortical FTLD-TDP subtype and subcortical involvement.

Materials and Methods

Cases

This study was performed in accordance with institutional ethical standards, including informed consent of the individual participant and/or legal representative. The University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada research brain bank contains more than 100 cases with a clinical history of dementia and post-mortem confirmation of primary FTLD-TDP pathology. Inclusion criteria required the availability of complete neurological notes from behavioural neurologists at the UBC Clinic for Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders, which were available for 54 cases from 1988 onwards. Four additional cases with psychotic symptoms from the Brain Bank associated with the DZNE and the University of Tübingen, Germany, were also included. The exclusion criteria were the presence of severe AD (high level of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change as per NIA-AA criteria [37]) or significant alternate neurodegenerative pathologies on post-mortem evaluation. Most of these cases were included in previously reported cohorts 14,15.

Patients were clinically evaluated at the time of presentation and followed up yearly until they were admitted to long-term care facilities. Clinical charts were reviewed for the presence and type of comorbid psychiatric symptoms by an investigator (VHR) blinded to the FTLD-TDP subtype and genetic status of the patient. Cases that were more difficult to classify from a clinical perspective were reviewed in consultation with a psychiatrist (FVR).

Genetic evaluation

All cases were evaluated for the presence of the C9orf72 mutation, either by genetic analysis or by histological evaluation for the presence of dipeptide repeats (DPR), yielding 24 positive cases. Of the remaining 34 non-C9orf72 cases, 27 cases had genetic testing for other common FTLD-TDP-causing mutations as described previously 37. The test results for these cases are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Pathology

A standard neuropathological evaluation was performed in all cases, including the evaluation of non-TDP-43 neurodegenerative conditions. Cases included in this study had at most stage Braak IV neurofibrillary pathology with no more than moderate numbers of senile neuritic plaques (classified as moderate Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and corresponding to an intermediate level of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change using NIA-AA criteria 38). Only one case had Lewy-related pathology (diffuse neocortical type 39 or Braak stage 5 40). This case did not exhibit psychotic symptoms.

For the evaluation of FTLD-TDP pathology subtype, immunohistochemistry with a phosphorylation-independent TDP-43 primary antibody (ProteinTech Group anti-TARDBP; 1:1000) was performed on 5-μm-thick sections of the frontal neocortex, cerebral white matter, hippocampus, striatum, midbrain, medulla and, where available, spinal cord. Evaluation of the neocortical FTLD-TDP pathology included semiquantitative assessment of different types of TDP-43 immunoreactive cellular inclusions (NCI, DN, GCI, threads) and total pathology burden in superficial and deep neocortical laminae of the frontal cortex as per current guidelines 8,14. Subcortical FTLD-TDP pathology evaluation was performed on sections of cerebral white matter, hippocampal dentate and CA1 region, striatum, substantia nigra, hypoglossal nucleus and spinal cord ventral grey matter (when available) 8,14,15 The cases were assigned neocortical and subcortical A, B, AB and C subtypes. Our cohort did not include unequivocal FTLD-TDP subtype E cases.

Statistics

Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate differences in proportions between groups. Two-tailed T-tests and Mann-Whitney tests were used for the evaluation of continuous and ordinal variables between groups, respectively. The significance level was set at p &lt; 0.05. Binomial logistic regression analysis with psychosis as the dependent variable and sex, age of onset, disease duration, neocortical FTLD-TDP type (B/non-B), genetics (C9/non-C9), clinical motor neuron disease (MND, present/absent) and pathological LMN TDP-43 inclusions (present/absent) was performed to identify significant contributing factors.

Results

Clinical characteristics and genetics

Details of the demographic, clinical, genetic and pathological characteristics of our study cohort are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Within the entire cohort of 58 patients with complete clinical notes, 19 (33%) had significant psychotic and/or paranoid symptomatology. 15 of these had delusions, with or without hallucinations, of enough severity to be identified during routine neurological interviews or as presenting symptoms. Four additional cases had prominent paranoia, bordering on persecutory delusions. Of note, these patients were evaluated by specialists in behavioural neurology, and most did not have extensive psychiatric evaluations. The remaining 39 cases displayed either no psychiatric symptoms or variable degrees of obsessive, depressive or aggressive symptoms. A summary of the demographic, clinical and genetic characteristics of our cohort is presented in Table 1. Sex distribution, age at onset and disease duration were not significantly different between cases with or without psychotic symptoms. The percentage of clinically recognized ALS was also not different between the groups (Table 1).

Of the 19 patients with psychotic symptoms, 11 (58%) had positive genetic testing or histological features (DPR inclusions) for an underlying C9orf72 repeat expansion. Of the remainder eight non-C9orf72 cases, one patient had a GRN mutation, one a UBQLN2 mutation, five had no mutations identified and one did not have genetic testing. Of note, the patient with psychotic symptoms and a GRN mutation developed delusions in her 20s and was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder in her 30s, approximately 20 years prior to developing language impairments and semantic dementia. In contrast to the patients with psychotic symptoms, only 13 (33%) of those without psychosis had positive genetic testing or histological features for an underlying C9orf72 mutation. Of those without psychotic symptoms, eleven carried pathogenic mutations in GRN (N=8), TIA1 (N=2) and TBK1 genes (N=1), while nine were negative for common FTLD mutations, and six did not have genetic testing. In line with prior published reports 24,25,28,31, these data suggest that C9orf72 mutations are more frequent in those with psychotic symptoms than those without, though this difference did not reach statical significance in our cohort. In addition, 11 out of 24 of the patients carrying a C9orf72 mutation developed psychotic symptoms, whereas only one out of nine of those with a GRN mutation had such symptoms in our cohort.

Neuropathology

The proportion of neocortical FTLD-TDP subtypes A, B, AB and C in cases with psychotic symptoms was 11%, 47%, 37% and 5%, respectively (Table 2), whereas in those without psychosis, these proportions were 26%, 42%, 16% and 16%. The distribution of subcortical subtypes (A, B, AB and C) in cases with and without psychotic symptoms was similar to that of neocortical subtypes: 16%, 47%, 32%, and 5% versus 32%, 39%, 13%, and 16% in non-psychotic cases, respectively. The increased frequencies of type B and AB pathology in patients with psychotic symptoms vs. those without were not statistically significant when each group was considered separately. When cases were dichotomized into those with any type B pathology (i.e. either pure B or AB) and those with no type B pathology (those with either pure type A or C), we found that type B pathology showed a trend to be overrepresented in those with psychotic symptoms (84% neocortical and 79% subcortical, respectively) compared to those without (58% neocortical and 53% subcortical, respectively) (Table 2; p=0.07 two-tailed Fisher’s exact test).

Because the C9orf72 repeat expansion is associated with psychotic symptoms and most often has subtype B or AB pathology, we sought to understand whether the association of type B pathology with psychosis was entirely due to the influence of the C9orf72 mutation. We found that type B pathology was also more common in non-C9orf72 patients with psychotic symptoms (6/8, 75%) compared to those without (10/26, 38%), although the numbers of cases were too low to reach statistical significance. Binomial logistic regression analyses (Table 3) showed that type B pathology was the factor with the largest effect size and the only statistically significant element in three models with different combinations of factors including TDP subtype, C9 status, sex, age of onset, disease duration and clinical MND. Together, this suggests that the presence of psychotic symptoms is associated with FTLD-TDP subtype B pathology to a greater extent than that attributable to the C9orf72 mutation.

In an attempt to elucidate an anatomical and/or cellular substrate for delusions and hallucinations, we compared the severity of TDP-43 pathology in different neocortical laminae, limbic and subcortical regions in FTLD-TDP type B cases with and without psychotic symptoms (Figure 1) 14,15. None of these measures showed a statistically significant difference between groups, although there was a trend for cases with psychotic symptoms to have more severe pathology in the cerebral white matter and fewer inclusions in LMN (cranial nerve XII and spinal cord motor neurons), especially in the spinal cord. Indeed, a statistically larger number of patients with asymptomatic LMN involvement (TDP-43 pathology in LMN without a clinical diagnosis of MND) was identified in the group with psychotic symptoms (10/19, 56%) than in those without (8/38, 21%; Table 1; P=0.03 two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) irrespective of pathological subtype and even after controlling for C9orf72 carrier status. This would raise the possibility that the pathophysiological processes that increase the risk for the development of psychotic symptoms may, at the same time, result in a higher likelihood of subclinical LMN pathology.

Discussion

This study addressing the correlation between FTLD-TDP pathological subtypes and associated subcortical involvement with psychotic symptoms showed that psychotic symptomatology is associated with underlying FTLD-TDP subtype B pathological features, which is only partially explained by the known association of C9orf72 mutations with both subtype B pathology and psychosis 2,24,25,28,31. This is consistent with previous studies that showed that patients with psychosis and autopsy-confirmed FTLD-TDP, including familial and sporadic cases, have a higher proportion of subtype B than A pathology 23,26. A more recent study found a correlation between the rare FTLD-TDP type E pattern and neuropsychiatric symptoms 32. An additional report showed the same prevalence of psychotic symptoms in type A and type B FTLD-TDP 41, although this cohort contained more C9orf72 mutation carriers classified as type A than ours. The greater proportion of FTLD-TDP type A among C9orf72 mutation carriers in the latter study and the fact investigators in one study consider FTLD-TDP type E to be a variant of type B 42 may be explained, at least partly, by interrater variability in FTLD-TDP typing among neuropathologists 16.

Although analysis of other subcortical pathological features in our cohort did not confirm the recently reported association between hallucinations and TDP-43 pathology burden in the granular cell layer of the hippocampus 32, our previous studies have shown that, on average, FTLD-TDP type B pathology is associated with more granule layer pathology than either type A or type C 15. Detailed analysis of the results of this study also revealed that rather than the overall TDP-43 pathology burden in subcortical regions it is the frequency of individual pathological features in each region that is different between types. For example, the total burden of striatal TDP-43 pathology is not significantly different between types, however, type B has significantly more diffuse NCI and GCI than A or C, whereas A has more NII and C shows the greatest amount of compact NCI compared to other types 15. This suggests that although all types affect the CNS diffusely, each one is likely associated with different pathophysiological processes that result in distinct morphological patterns of inclusions.

The association between the histological involvement of LMNs, a salient subcortical feature associated with subtype B pathology 15,17 and psychotic symptoms has also been identified at the clinical level. Relatives of patients with ALS are at higher risk of developing psychotic disorders, a trait that is pronounced in kindreds carrying a C9orf72 mutation, but is also present in those without 43. Genetic analysis using genome-wide association study data from over 100,000 unique individuals revealed a genetic correlation between ALS and schizophrenia which would result in a modest increase in comorbidity between ALS and schizophrenia 44. Together, this suggests that the pathophysiological process to which LMNs are vulnerable may also affect neuronal cell types and/or circuits involved in the generation of psychotic symptoms.

It was surprising that clinical MND was less common in our patients with psychotic symptoms and that subclinical LMN involvement showed the strongest association with such symptoms, being more than twice as frequent as in patients without psychotic symptomatology [Table 1]. Although this might suggest that factors that modulate the rate of progression of LMN pathology (e.g. ATXN2 intermediate length repeats 45) or the anatomical distribution may be inversely related to the clinical development of psychotic symptoms, it must also be considered that earlier death and antemortem morbidity of patients with ALS might reduce the opportunity for psychotic symptoms to be recognized during the disease course.

Although our cohort was evaluated pathologically in a consistent manner, only crude correlations with clinical phenotypes are possible, given the referral bias of our cohort (only dementia clinic patients) and the long period of time covered in this study over which clinical diagnostic criteria and evaluation protocols have evolved. Additionally, the standard neuropathological evaluation performed in these cases limited the range of sampled anatomical sites.

Conclusions

In summary, this work suggests that psychotic symptoms in patients with FTLD-TDP tend to be associated with subtype B pathology. Importantly, although this relationship is partly explained by a higher frequency of C9orf72 carriers in patients with psychotic symptoms, the relationship extends more broadly, suggesting a direct mechanistic link to this particular pattern of TDP-43 pathology.

Key points

FTLD-TDP type B pathology tends to be more frequent in patients with psychotic symptoms than in those without.

This relationship is only partially explained by the association of type B pathology with C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion.

Within subjects with FTLD-TDP type B pathology, psychotic symptoms tended to be associated with a greater burden of TDP-43 pathology in the white matter and a lower burden in lower motor neurons.
