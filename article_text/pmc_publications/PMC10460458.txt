Purpose –

Research about the prevalence of dementia among older adults in the incarceration system is currently lacking, and further investigation is warranted. Considering the high level of healthcare needs, unique behavioural issues and difficulty to rehabilitate within the system due to its punitive approach and lack of effective rehabilitation programs, further investigation is warranted to characterize and determine the number of incarcerated older adults with dementia. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of individuals with dementia in the prison system while also describing the incarceration, demographic and offence-related characteristics of this unique population.

Design/methodology/approach –

South Carolina (SC) Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Registry (1992–2016) and South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) data (Fiscal years 1992–2019) were cross-referenced. The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) cases in the corrections system was calculated using South Carolina Alzheimer’s Disease (SC AD) SC ADRD Registry and SCDC data. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine strength and direction of relationships between year of incarceration and frequency of ADRD cases both prior to and after incarcerations, respectively. Significant differences by age group, race, gender and dementia type were determined using a two-tailed pooled t-test and Bonferroni approach where appropriate. Count data for types of crimes committed are also presented.

Findings –

The linkage showed that there were 2,171 individuals within the SC AD Registry who have been in the corrections system, about 1% of those in the Registry. Of these individuals, 1,930 cases were diagnosed with ADRD after incarceration and 241 prior to incarceration. In 2016, 317 individuals with ADRD were incarcerated. For ages 55 and above in South Carolina, the prevalence of ADRD is 6.7% in the general, non-incarcerated population compared to 14.4% in the incarcerated population. Additional results showed that those diagnosed with ADRD between 55 and 65 years of age had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (34.6 years of age) than those diagnosed between 66 and 74 years of age (55.9 years of age), indicating that those incarcerated earlier in life had an earlier dementia diagnosis. Additionally, African Americans had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (43.4 years of age) than Whites (46.2 years of age) and females had significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (42.9 years of age) than males (45 years of age). When investigating trends, results showed a significant positive linear association between year and frequency of ADRD diagnoses (p-value &lt; 0.05) for those with ADRD diagnosis prior to incarceration and a significant decreasing linear association (p-value &lt; 0.0001) in the number of individuals with an ADRD diagnosis after corrections. Findings also showed that a large percentage of older adults with ADRD in prison did not commit a violence offence.

Originality/value –

This study links a population-based Alzheimer’s disease registry and state-wide corrections data to estimate the prevalence of individuals with dementia in the prison system. This linkage presents an opportunity to fill in significant gaps and contribute to the body of literature on dementia among people in prison in the USA.

pmcIntroduction

Dementia has been understood as a biomedical phenomenon strongly influenced by personal histories, social interactions and contexts. Although not considered a normal part of aging, individuals become at higher risk of developing dementia as they age (Corrada et al., 2010; Doyle and Rubinstein, 2014). Dementia is most commonly diagnosed in individuals over the age of 65, but earlier onset is possible in individuals as early as their mid-20s (Vieira et al., 2013). Research about the prevalence of dementia among older adults incarcerated in state prison is currently lacking. Due to unique incarceration trends such as mass incarceration comprised by racial disparities, a rise in both men and women in prison, and a growing number of aging incarcerated individuals, the US prison system faces challenges to provide services to its aging population, particularly among those with symptoms of dementia. Considering the high level of health care needs, unique behavioural issues and difficulty to rehabilitate within the system due to its punitive approach and lack of effective rehabilitation programs, further investigation is warranted to characterize and determine the number of incarcerated older adults with dementia. This study seeks to use a state-wide Alzheimer’s and related dementias registry and existing incarceration data sources to calculate the prevalence of dementia among older adults in the state prison system.

Incarceration trends in the US population

The USA is the largest incarcerator globally, holding almost 20% of the entire incarcerated population in the world. Criminal justice policies based on narratives of criminal behaviour and disproportionate imprisonment of minorities are critical factors that influenced the mass incarceration phenomenon observed in the USA (Cahalan, 1979). Nowadays, such disproportion still exists. In many American cities, rates of incarceration are particularly high among Black people and Native American (Reisner et al., 2014). The rate of incarceration among Black Americans is five times higher than among White Americans. Similarly, Latinx individuals are 1.3 more likely to be incarcerated than non-Latinx White (The Sentencing Project, 2021). When considering gender, men compromise the highest percentage of individuals in prison compared to women, 93% and 6.3%, respectively (The Sentencing Project, 2022). Among Black male who go to prison, sentences are about 20.4% longer than similarly situated White incarcerated persons while females from all races tend to receive shorter sentences (United States Sentencing Commission, 2017). Adding the number of men and women from different ages and races, the USA currently has 1.8 million people living in the US prison system (Kang-Brown et al., 2021).

Older adults in prison

Older incarcerated people make up the fastest-growing demographic in the US prison system. Between 1993 and 2013, the number of people 55 or older in state prison increased from 26,300 to 131,500, an increase of 400%. Consequently, the incarcerated older adults went from 3% to 10% of the total state prison population (Carson and Sabol, 2016).

In contrast, the incarceration rate for young adults ages 18 to 24 decreased by 25%, changing from 752 to 563 between 1993 and 2013 (Carson and Sabol, 2016). According to Widra (2020), individuals aged 55 or older presently comprise 7% to 16% of incarcerated persons, depending on the state. It is estimated that older people in prison (age 55 or older) will represent a third of the incarcerated population in the US prison system by 2030 (The Osborne Association, 2018). The aging population living in prisons has been categorized into two main profiles: individuals who have been incarcerated as a young adult and are aging in prison as a result of a lengthy prison sentence, and those who are first-time incarcerated persons admitted as older adults (Blowers and Blevins, 2015; Cipriani et al., 2017). Alongside with the increase in the number of older adults in prison, incarcerated individuals face an accelerated aging process compared to counterparts outside the prison (Williams et al., 2012) raising concerns about early onset of aging-related health diseases among prisoners in general.

Dementia in prison – challenges determining prevalence

The prevalence of dementia among people in US prisons is unknown. Although this literature review aimed to include articles and reports published within the past 10 years, the lack of current studies and data on dementia among individuals in prison is a significant gap and challenge to understanding the issue at hand. This challenge is partly due to the lack of national survey and poor prevalence data information (Cipriani et al., 2017; Moll, 2013a). The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) is typically the only source for national-level correctional health data, but the agency currently does not collect any data on dementia among people in prison, jail, the court system or who have been arrested. Although the exclusion of dementia on BJS surveys represents a barrier to establishing dementia prevalence among individuals in the criminal justice system, recent disability reports show that 25% of state prisoners ages 55 to 64, and 27% of those age 65 or older have a cognitive disability – defined as a serious challenge concentrating, remembering things and making decisions (Bronson et al., 2017a; Maruschak et al., 2021). In addition, estimating the percentage of older adults in prison with dementia is further complicated due to lack of lack of standard demographic and health information collected among the states. Researchers also argue that methods used to assess dementia among the aging prison population might not be sensitive or appropriate for an incarcerated population, as such estimates of dementia are likely undercounts (Brooke, 2021; Moll, 2013a).

The few US studies that do exist use estimations to calculate prison dementia rates. Regan et al. (2002) study with 671 individuals in the Tennessee State Prison shows 5% prevalence rate of dementia (i.e. 33 individuals in prison) among those age 55 or older and a likelihood for a higher proportion of cases among incarcerated women in the respective state prison. In comparison, Wilson and Barboza (2010) suggest that there were 41,740 older prisoners with dementia in 2010 in the USA. They also estimate that there will be 70,341 and 127,130 by 2030 and 2050, respectively. The authors calculated these numbers based on the prevalence rate of dementia in the general population; however, they argue that these estimates should be considered as a baseline and suggest at least doubling the numbers to have a more specific number of dementia cases among the older prisoner population. This view corresponds with data that show statistically higher prevalence rates of mental illnesses, substance use disorders and disabilities among people in prison when compared to their general population counterparts (Bronson and Berzofsky, 2017; Bronson et al., 2017b).

Outside the USA, studies from England estimate the prevalence rate of dementia among people in prison to be 1% to 12% (Fazel et al., 2001; Kingston et al., 2011). Kingston et al. (2011) shows an 8% prevalence rate for dementia and 12% for cognitive impairment among older adults in prison. In France, a study showed that about a fifth of older male prisoners had executive function test scores suggestive of dementia. However, the study did not clarify if those with mild cognitive impairment were also included (Combalbert et al., 2018).

Difficulties in assessing the prevalence of dementia among the aging incarcerated population have also been attributed to small samples, unstandardized assessment tools and different age groupings (Di Lorito, 2018; Brooke, 2021). Regarding the latter, there is some debate over whether “old age” begins earlier among people in prison than those in the general population. An American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) report (2012) suggests that the tendency for people in prison to come from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. poverty and lack of health care) means that many enter prison with health conditions. When coupled with the fact that the prison environment and experience itself can accelerate the aging process, the ACLU and other researchers believe that “old age” among people in prison should have an earlier cut-off, probably between ages 50 and 55 (American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), 2012; Williams et al., 2014). Despite disagreement about what specific chronological age prisoners start aging, researchers assert that incarcerated individuals have an early onset of health chronic conditions more frequently observed among older adult groups (Williams et al., 2012). It is important not only to investigate prevalence but also report diagnosis prior to and after incarceration, to identify if there is an association between incarceration and dementia cases. In addition, the length of incarceration, age at [first] incarceration and charges associated with incarceration among older persons with dementia warrant exploration.

Incarceration length (time spent in prison)

The carceral environment is detrimental to prisoners’ overall health and can exacerbate pre-existing or new health issues (Armour, 2012). Prison sentences are determined by type of offence, prosecutor bargain, statutory maximum sentence of imprisonment and first-time or repeat offences (Kim et al., 2015). Although sentence length does not solely determine for how long a prisoner will actually be in prison, those facing lengthy sentences are more likely to also have lengthy incarceration (Mauer, 2019). One-third (31%) of adults age 65 or older in state prison were serving a life or death sentence in 2013 (Carson and Sabol, 2016). Additional data estimate that 50% of state prisoners age 65 or older who were in prison in 2013, had been there for more than 10 years, accounting for about 14,700 people (Carson and Sabol, 2016). Prisoners experiencing lengthy incarceration are more likely to develop self-harm behaviours, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic illnesses, posttraumatic stress disorder and to commit suicide (Fazel et al., 2016). In addition, those who spent more years in prison are exposed to more years of poor nutrition increasing their risk to develop chronic health conditions such as diabetes a well-known risk factor of dementia (Datta et al., 2015; Simeni Njonnou et al., 2020).

Age at incarceration

In the USA, men represent the vast majority (90%) of prisoners in custody. Guerino et al. (2010) suggest that imprisonment of men is 14 times higher than among women. These men are overwhelmingly young with the highest incidence among those between 20 and 40 years old. Recent data shows that those in this age range represent 63.3% of all individuals in prison (Federal Bureau of Prisons, 2022). Consequently, the population of older prisoners is growing. According to the Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, persons age 50 and older comprised 5.0% of all arrests in US in 2000, and 9.4% of all arrests in 2011, indicating a 90% increase in percentage. Older prisoners are more likely than younger ones to report higher rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and liver disease (Pridemore, 2014). They also can develop mobility impairments, hearing and vision loss and cognitive limitations, which are related to dementia (Human Rights Watch, 2012).

Types of crimes committed by older prisoners

There is limited data on the types of crimes committed by older adults who have been admitted into the incarceration system with a dementia diagnosis prior to or after their sentence. Furthermore, what does exist is not congruent regarding the incidence of criminal behaviour among older incarcerated individuals with dementia. BJS data show that first-time, older adult incarcerated persons are associated with violent crimes. New court commitment admission among older prisoners (age 55 or older) were higher for violent offences (30.5%) compared to property offences (22%), sexual assault or rape (12.8%), assault (9.8%) and murder (2.8%) (Carson and Sabol, 2016). Some studies suggest that cognitive disorders rarely led to crime among older incarcerated persons with a psychiatric condition, while others argue a link between criminal manifestation and neuropathology, such as dementia (Cipriani et al., 2015; di Lorito et al., 2018). Older prisoners however have a lower recidivism rate after release compared to younger prisoners who have served similar sentences (Durose et al., 2014; Rakes et al., 2018).

South Carolina has a unique opportunity to link a population-based Alzheimer’s Disease Registry and state-wide corrections data to estimate the prevalence of individuals with dementia in the state prison system. This linkage also provides the opportunity to investigate how sentence length and age at incarceration, which can predispose or exacerbate dementia due to its detrimental impact on prisoner’s physical and mental health, varies by demographic characteristics. In addition, offence-related characteristics can be examined in this unique population. This linkage presents an opportunity to fill in significant gaps and contribute to the body of literature on dementia among individuals in prison. This study aims to answer the following questions: Q1. What is the prevalence of dementia among those incarcerated in 2016?

Q2. How many Alzheimer’s disease registry cases were incarcerated prior to and after the dementia diagnosis over the past two decades? Are there any significant trends during this time?

Q3. Among Alzheimer’s disease registry cases with a history of incarceration, does the age of first incarceration and sentence length differ by gender, age group and race?

Q4. What types of crimes were committed by Alzheimer’s disease registry cases with a history of incarceration?

Materials and methods

Study design

The study sample consisted of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) identified by the South Carolina Alzheimer’s Disease (SC AD) and Related Dementias Registry (hereinafter “Registry”). The Registry incorporates data from multiple sources that provide administrative data on inpatient hospitalizations, mental health records, Medicaid claims, emergency department visits, memory clinic encounters, vital records and long-term care evaluations. Registrants selected for this study were those with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM and ICD10-CM) coded medical record indicating AD, vascular dementia, mixed dementia and other dementia diagnoses. Other dementia diagnoses include 14 other dementia-related diagnoses, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies, frontotemporal and dementias related to traumatic brain injury, AIDS or alcohol or drug abuse (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM). South Carolina residents diagnosed with or treated for ADRD by a Registry-participating medical or community institution between 1992 and 2016 were included in the analysis. The Registry notes that definitive diagnosis of alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias is difficult, particularly in the early stages, and that Registry staff is “not directly involved in diagnosis” (SC AD Registry Annual Report, 2021).

Analysis

Registry data was cross-referenced with incarceration data collected by the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC). Incarcerations analysed were limited to those available through SCDC and, as such, only included incarcerations occurring in state prisons in SC. SCDC incarceration data available for reference extended from Fiscal year (FY) 1992 to FY 2019. Note: the use of South Carolina Department of Corrections records in the preparation of this material is acknowledged, but it is not to be construed as implying official approval of the Department of Corrections of the conclusions presented.

Results were analysed using SAS OnDemand for Academics. The prevalence of ADRD in incarcerated individuals was calculated using 2016 SCDC data. The prevalence of ADRD in South Carolina was calculated using the 2016 population estimates from the United States Census Bureau and the 2016 South Carolina Alzheimer’s Registry. The Registry captures all ages of diagnosis, but SCDC releases data by age groups. This analysis used the 55+ population in the SCDC, Registry and Census to assure similar comparison groups. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the strength and direction of relationships between the year of incarceration and frequency of ADRD cases both prior to and after incarceration, respectively. Significant differences between males and females when studying total incarceration years and age at first corrections were determined using a two-tailed pooled t-test. Because more than two groups were being compared, significant differences between age group and race were determined using the Bonferroni approach. All tests used in this analysis were two-tailed with an alpha-level set at 0.05. Count data for types of crimes committed are also presented.

Results

From 1992 to 2016, the Registry contained 279,085 individuals with ADRD. The Registry and SCDC linkage showed that there were 2,171 individuals within the Registry who have been in the corrections system, about 1% of those in the Registry. The results show that 1,930 cases were diagnosed with ADRD after incarceration and 241 prior to incarceration. In 2016, there were 102,384 individuals in the Registry, and 317 were incarcerated. The prevalence of ADRD in South Carolina was calculated by dividing the number of Registry cases by the SC population (United States Census Bureau, 2016). The prevalence of ADRD in South Carolina’s incarcerated population was calculated by dividing the number of individuals incarcerated with a dementia diagnosis by the total number of incarcerated individuals in South Carolina (South Carolina Department of Corrections 2016). All calculations were performed on individuals 55 and over. This corresponds to an ADRD prevalence of 14.4% in the incarcerated population and 6.8% in the general population in South Carolina (Table 1).

Among Registry cases with a history of incarceration, the average age at first incarceration ranged between 35 and 56 years of age. Those diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and those younger than 55 years of age had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (35.6 years old) than all other age groups except those 85 and above (43.5 years old). Additionally, those diagnosed between 55 and 65 years of age had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration than those diagnosed between 66 and 74 years of age. African Americans with ADRD had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (43.4 years of age) than Whites (46.2 years of age), although no significant differences were found when comparing either mean to other races (42.9 years of age). Males with ADRD had a significantly higher mean age at first incarceration (45 years of age) than females (42.4 years of age). Males also had a significantly higher mean total incarceration time than females. Mean and standard deviations for total incarceration years and ages at first corrections are shown in Table 2.

From 1992 to 2019, the number of people with a known ADRD diagnosis prior to incarceration ranged from 1 to 19 per year (Figure 1). There was a significant positive linear association between year and frequency of ADRD diagnoses (p-value &lt; 0.05). However, the test for trend showed that the correlation between the two variables is weak (r = 0.47883). It should be noted that individuals were identified using the charge date listed in the SCDC database which extends through FY 2019.

From 1991 to 2014, the number of individuals with an ADRD diagnosis after incarceration ranged from 2 to 234 per year (Figure 2). There was a significant decreasing linear association (p-value &lt; 0.0001) between year and frequency of cases. The linear association is relatively strong with a Pearson correlation coefficient value of −0.89183. Some individuals from FY 1992 were identified in 1991. No individuals in 2015 and 2016 were incarcerated prior to ADRD diagnosis.

In Table 3, the most serious criminal offences among Registry cases with a history of incarceration are identified (n = 2652). Individuals who were incarcerated multiple times have more than one offence reported. These offences were separated into categories and include violent, property, white-collar, organized and victimless crimes (University of Minnesota, 2015). The most common were victimless crimes (n = 1160). These crimes include possession or distribution of drugs, traffic violations and disorderly conduct. The second most common offences were violent crimes (n = 691) and property crimes (n = 599). Violent crimes include resisting arrest, manslaughter, armed robbery, assault and battery and property crimes include attempting burglary, arson and attempted robbery. The least common were white-collar crimes (n = 155) and organized crimes (n = 47). White-collar crimes include fraud, extortion and blackmail. Organized crimes include involvement in drug trafficking and conspiracies and aiding the escape of a fugitive.

Discussion

Findings from this study suggest that in 2016 the prevalence of ADRD among adults 55 and older in South Carolina prisons was 14.4% compared to 6.8% for the general, non-incarcerated population. In addition, our data linkage showed that 317 individuals with ADRD were incarcerated in South Carolina prisons in 2016. These data points provide an important estimate for the field because data on the prevalence of ADRD among US correctional populations are scarce. The higher prevalence of ADRD among people in prison than those in the general population is not unexpected when their overall health profiles are considered. When compared to people in the community, people in prison generally have a worse health profile due to pre-incarceration socio-economic factors (i.e. homelessness and unemployment). Social determinants of health overlap with many criminogenic risk factors, effectively leaving incarcerated populations not only sicker but also with less access to appropriate, quality health care. Data show that 44% of people in prison had a chronic health condition versus 31% of those in the community (Maruschak et al., 2015). Twice as many people in prison (26.3%) than in the community had high blood pressure (13.9%), and nearly five times as many in prison (10.4%) than in the community (1.9%) had heart-related problems (Maruschak et al., 2015). Mental illness and substance use disorders are also disproportionately higher among people in prison than in the general population, both of which can increase one’s risk for dementia (Bronson and Berzofsky, 2017; Bronson et al., 2017a, 2017b).

The results showed that those diagnosed with ADRD between 55 and 65 years of age had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (34.6 years of age) than those diagnosed between 66 and 74 years of age (55.9 years of age), indicating that those incarcerated earlier in life had an earlier dementia diagnosis.

Additionally, African Americans diagnosed with ADRD had a significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (43.4 years of age) than Whites (46.2 years of age). Black, Indigenous and ethnic minorities are more likely to be arrested, charged and incarcerated than White peers, though prior research has shown no appreciable racial differences in average age at first arrest (Raphael and Rozo, 2019). Females also had significantly lower mean age at first incarceration (42.9 years of age) than males (45 years of age). These are notable findings because African Americans and females are disproportionately more likely than their counterparts to have Alzheimer’s or other dementias (Alzheimer’s Association Facts and Figures, 2021a, 2021b, SC AD Registry Annual Report, 2021). Previous studies have found mild behavioural impairment, a transitional state between normal ageing and dementia, includes mild psychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibition, impulsivity and depression (Taragano et al., 2009). These prodromal dementia symptoms could potentially predispose a person to behaviours that lead to arrest and incarceration at an earlier age. Racial and gender differences at the age of incarceration and their impact on dementia diagnosis is an area for further exploration.

When investigating trends over time, there was a significant positive linear association between year and frequency of ADRD diagnoses in people with a known ADRD diagnosis prior to incarceration. The test for trend was weak, and the number of cases for each year was low (range 1–19), so conclusions must be very tentative for these results. Results suggest that over the past two decades, more individuals with an ADRD diagnosis are being incarcerated. Further research would have to weigh multiple complex factors, including but not limited to trends in early and accurate ADRD diagnosis and issues with care management modalities which may not be keeping these individuals out of the criminal justice system

Results also showed a significant decreasing linear association (p-value &lt; 0.0001) in the number of individuals with an ADRD diagnosis after incarceration. This finding was surprising, considering previous research has shown that veterans aged 50+ who re-entered the community from incarceration had a 32% higher 10-year prevalence of dementia diagnosis than those without a history of incarceration (Kuffel, 2021). If sentence lengths have become shorter over time, decreasing mental and physical health exposures to ADRD, it could potentially explain the decrease in the number of diagnoses post-incarceration. In addition, although there is a decreasing trend in ADRD diagnosis after incarceration, it is possible that there are many individuals who have the disease but remain undiagnosed.

When analysing the types of crimes, we observed that a large percentage of older adults with ADRD in prison did not commit a violent offence. Rather, these data showed that the most common offence was victimless crimes (n = 1160), such as possession or distribution of drugs, traffic violations and disorderly conduct. Individuals with dementia develop issues with executive function, which manifests as disruptions of attentional control, memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and reasoning, among other cognitive problems (Guitar, 2018). The reported number of victimless crimes might reflect the loss of executive function that accompanies dementia. The second most common offences were violent crimes (n = 691). While individuals with ADRD can exhibit a certain level of aggressiveness and sometimes violent behaviour, especially in more advanced stages, more exploration would be required to identify pathways between ADRD and violent crime. According to Yu et al., individuals with Alzheimer’s disease have five times higher odds of aggression than healthy controls (Yu, 2021). The BJS report that new court commitment admissions among older prisoners were higher for violent offences than for other offences (Carson, 2016), though it is important to note that the majority of older adults do not have Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia. Prosecutors are generally more likely to prosecute violent offences even when the defendant exhibits possible cognitive impairments.

The identification and care of people with dementia in the justice system

Data collected for this study show that those with ADRD and a history of incarceration represent 1% of the total cases in the ADRD registry of South Carolina. In our sample of ADRD cases with a history of incarceration, the majority (89%) of the incarcerated individuals were diagnosed with dementia after incarceration. ADRD are neurodegenerative diseases that affect multiple areas in the body, including memory, reasoning and communication ability, alongside with behavioural and psychological symptoms (e.g. depression, psychosis, aggression and wandering), and people with ADRD often require comprehensive and extensive level of care to manage activities of daily living (ADLs), like feeding oneself and personal hygiene (Alzheimer’s Association, 2021; Mlinac and Feng, 2016). Given the rapidly increased number of individuals over 50 years old within prisons and that incarceration increases risk for dementia, the number of people behind bars with dementia is expected to rise, taxing the already stressed incarceration system and its staff to meet the needs of this complex group. Disproportionate rates of ADRD among persons who are incarcerated compared to those who are not incarcerated may reflect the heavy chronic disease burden among all persons who are incarcerated due to low health status, lack of health care and poor environment. Additionally, many have undiagnosed/untreated brain injuries, a critical risk factor for dementia. Noteworthy, these factors can also affect different group communities, hence, it is possible, that prison system are identifying these cases at a higher rate than in the community because the organization perceives the need to make changes in the number of staff and skills required. Changes in the workforce structure increase the need of funding, which, in turn, make the disease more noticeable.

Changes in the workforce structure

Most prisons do not receive enough funding, staff or training to provide geriatric healthcare services and accommodations and will likely struggle to properly care for people with dementia (Camhi et al., 2020). Nor is this work they want to do as they were hired to perform safety functions and not geriatric care. As such, policymakers, agency directors, justice actors and community leaders should consider working in concert to develop alternative placements or a new treatment paradigm that can better meet the needs of adults with dementia who are in prison.

Screening upon entry and annual cognitive assessments of adults over age 50 have been suggested as beneficial approaches to detecting early signs of dementia among people in prison (Brown, 2014; Gaston, 2017; Williams et al., 2012a). While screening tools would facilitate diagnosis of dementia, a standardized process specific for incarcerated individuals does not exist yet (Patterson et al., 2016). Other strategies such as dementia awareness training for staff might also contribute to early identification of incarcerated individuals in need of a dementia assessment (Williams et al., 2012a).

Adults in prison with cognitive impairment or dementia have high care needs, and the prison physical environment (e.g. dark corridors and rooms, stairs, long corridors leading to the congregated meals room, lack of adapted bathroom facilities and limited space for wheelchairs) is not conducive to supporting people with neurocognitive decline and might worsen symptoms or progress the disease itself (Schaub et al., 2018). In addition, a prison’s rigid rules and routines might pose challenges for individuals with dementia who are not always able to understand or follow rules. Combine this with staff who do not understand the reason for such misbehaviours and people with dementia receive infractions, sanctions and restrictive housing placements (Gaston, 2017; Fellner, 2012).

There are some dementia-friendly elements, such as using contrasting colours, clear signage, designated washing areas, ramps, adequate lighting and peer support programs that are possible to use in prison. Other examples of cost-effective dementia initiatives include physical exercises (e.g. yoga and Tai Chi), arts and crafts activities, gardening, better nutrition, smoking cessation programs and the management of weight, blood pressure and blood glucose among high-risk individuals (Brown, 2015; Maschi et al., 2012; Moll, 2013b). The use of aides or peers to assist people with dementia with their ADLs may be an option for prisons to explore, as this strategy helps to decrease the costs associated with advanced dementia care (Roblin et al., 2019; Singh, 2014). Such an approach can occur within a designated unit or in general population. For example, the Gold Coat model at the California Men’s Colony is a prisoner peer support program that trains people in prison who have exemplary behaviour to provide care to other prisoners with dementia and serve as assistant caregivers (Berry et al., 2016; TEDMED, 2016). Similar programs are in development or in place in other correctional facilities (Kitt-Lewis and Loeb, 2022; Loeb et al., 2021; Maschi and Kaye, 2019; Stewart and Lovely, 2017).

Perhaps though, the best approach is to divert the person with dementia, particularly those in the moderate to severe stages, out of prison and into a more appropriate level of care. Early medical release or compassionate release for this population is an alternative approach that should also be considered. Malloy et al. (2020) suggest that early release has been successfully done in the USA. However, it requires careful consideration of who might be eligible and a strategic plan that includes housing, access to appropriate care and treatment, consideration of stigma and acceptance, economic resources and recidivism risk and transition support (Hwang et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2014; Nielssen et al., 2018).

Strengths and limitations

The present study uses over twenty years of retrospective data to provide critical information about the prevalence of ADRD among South Carolinians who were incarcerated in prison, their demographics and offences. A definitive diagnosis of ADRD is difficult, particularly in the early stages. As this study only includes people with a formal diagnosis from a physician, the data likely underestimate the number of individuals with dementia in the prison system, meaning the true prevalence is likely higher. In addition, the data were limited to incarcerations that occurred in a state prison in South Carolina. Data for county and local level facilities (i.e. jails) are not available, thus, the findings are specific to the state prison population.

With the data available in the Registry and the census, we were able to calculate the prevalence of ADRD in the South Carolina general, non-incarcerated population among various age groups. The data structure did not allow for prevalence calculations in the incarcerated system for any ages other than 55 and older. Additional information about the prevalence of ADRD in older age groups is an important area of research, as literature shows prevalence increases with age. In this study, we were able to report criminal offences among individuals within the Registry. We were not able to distinguish which age groups, races or genders committed different crimes. Future studies investigating crimes committed by various demographic groups are required. Additionally, we used general criminologist categorizations for crimes in this study (University of Minnesota, 2015), and resisting arrest is considered a violent crime. In the context of the cognitive capacity of a person with dementia, it is questionable whether a resisting arrest should be considered a violent crime. We would need more information on whether or not the encounter was physical in nature to determine if this should be categorized as a violent crime when compared to more serious offences like assault or murder.

Although data analysed in this study refer to one state in the USA, limiting generalization, the findings contribute information for states that share similar characteristics. Given the lack of research and data on the prevalence of dementia among state prison populations, it is not possible to compare these results with other ADRD and dementia studies. This limitation reflects the significant gap in research, data and statistics on people with dementia who are involved with the criminal justice system and their entry pathway. In addition to establishing basic prevalence numbers, future research on dementia among incarcerated individuals should address the trajectory that led these individuals to be incarcerated and recommendations for a dementia care plan.

Conclusion

As the population ages and cases of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia continue to rise, there is a pressing need for further research and a broader discussion to determine how to best meet the needs of those with dementia in the justice system. Given the rapid increase in the incarceration rate of older adults (Carson and Sabol, 2016) that has been observed over time, dementia will continue to be a significant health issue for correctional facilities. Community, state and national efforts involving government leaders, policymakers, key stakeholders and researchers are needed to address this issue, and this study provides an important data point for the conversation.
