Objective:

Behavioral risk factors for dementia tend to co-occur and inter-relate, especially poor diet, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, and depression. Having multiple of these modifiable behavioral risk factors (MBRFs) may predict a particularly shortened cognitive healthspan, and therefore, may signal high-risk status/high intervention need.

Methods:

This secondary analyses of data from the Cardiovascular Health Study included 3149 participants aged 65–74 years (mean age=69.5, standard deviation (SD)=2.5; 59.6% female). MBRF exposures were self-reports regarding: (1) diet, (2) activity, (3) sleep, and (4) depression symptoms. We primarily analyzed MBRF counts. Over up to 26 years of follow-up, we assessed the: (1) number of remaining cognitively healthy life years (CHLYs); and (2) percentage of remaining life years (LYs) that were CHLYs (%CHLY). We estimated CHLYs as time before a dementia diagnosis, cognitive screener scores indicating impairment, proxy port indicating significant cognitive decline, or dementia medication use.

Results:

Participants averaged a remaining 16 LYs (SD=7), 12.2 CHLYs (SD = 6.6), and 78.1% of LYs being CHLYs (SD = 25.6). Compared with having no MBRFs, having one was associated with ~1 less LY and CHLY, but not a relatively lower %CHLY. In contrast, having 3+ MBRFs was associated with about 2–3 fewer LYs and CHLYs as well as about 6% lower %CHLY (95% confidence interval: −9.0, −2.5 %CHLYs), p=0.001).

Conclusions:

MBRF-related reductions in the cognitive healthspan are most apparent when people have multiple MBRFs. Future research is needed to determine if/how behavioral risks converge mechanistically, and if dementia prevention efficacy improves when targeting MBRF combinations.

pmcIn the United States, life expectancy increased from about 70 years in 1960 to about 80 years in 2015 (1). With increases in longevity, more people are living to ages with high dementia risk. Dementia incidence rates double approximately every five years after age 65 (2, 3). Dementia is associated with functional impairment (4), emotional distress (5), and disruptive behaviors (6), as well as significant social costs. From the time of dementia diagnosis, health care costs an estimated $321,780 in the United States ($184,500 greater than for a person without dementia) that is paid largely by the affected family (7). These major consequences of dementia highlight the importance of extending, not just lifespan, but also the absolute and relative cognitive healthspan.

Dementia incidence could be prevented or delayed by targeting inter-related behavioral and physical health risk factors (8, 9). Physical health factors that can affect brain aging include mid-life hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes (10). Although typically examined separately, these physical risk factors often co-occur (11–14). A recent meta-analysis (15) found that, compared to individuals with no risk factors, dementia risk increased by 20% in people with one risk factor, 65% in people with two risk factors, and 100% in people with three or more risk factors. These studies mostly examined combinations of physical health risk factors, and therefore support the treatment of multiple cardiometabolic and vascular risk factors to prevent or delay dementia incidence.

Dementia prevention may similarly benefit from targeting multiple co-occurring (combinations) of modifiable behavioral risk factors (MBRFs). While usually examined separately or as competing explanations (covariates) in statistical association tests, common MBRFs co-occur including sleep disturbances (16), depression (17), physical inactivity (18), and poor diet (19). While these MBRFs are typically treated in separate interventions, multi-factorial approaches may be optimal for several reasons. MBRFs can promote or perpetuate each other. For example, sleep disturbances can impede healthy dietary choices (20), and bi-directional relationships exist between sleep and mood disturbances (21), as well as between depression and physical inactivity (22). Effects of these MBRFs may also converge on shared physical pathways to pathological brain aging (23, 24) like inflammation (25–28) and vascular disease (29–32). Furthermore, targeting individual MBRFs separately can also lead to “intervention fatigue,” i.e., if attempting to modify poor diet, physical activity, and sleep with separate approaches. In contrast, integrated multifactorial interventions show promise for preventing cognitive decline (33).

It is plausible that people who have multiple of the common MBRFs (sleep disturbance, depression, physical inactivity, and poor diet) are at particularly high risk for dementia; and targeting these MBRF profiles with multifactorial interventions could have benefits. But we are unaware of data regarding whether overall MBRF level or certain MBRFs combinations have particularly strong relationships cognitive healthspan. If particularly prognostic MBRFs combinations (i.e., those related to a shortened and/or compressed cognitive healthspan) are identified, they could represent high-yield targets for multi-component prevention approaches.

Here, we assessed common individual MBRFs (poor diet, physical inactivity, sleep disturbances, and depression), and their counts/combinations, when study participants were 65–74 years old. Two outcomes, the absolute and relative remaining cognitive health span, were determined prospectively over two decades as part of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). We measured these outcomes as: (1) remaining cognitively healthy life years (CHLYs); and (2) remaining percentage of life years (LYs) that were CHLYs. Our hypothesis was that having multiple MBRFs would relate to living fewer CHLYs (both length and percentage). We took a discovery-based approach to identify any specific pairs of these common MBRFs that were particularly predictive of CHLYs.

Methods

Sample:

The parent sample included 5201 Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants recruited from 1989–1990. The CHS is a prospective observational cohort study of community-dwelling older adults who are 65+ years of age. As described previously (34), participants were recruited from a random sampling of Health Care Finance Administration Medicare eligibility lists. The CHS included four sites: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Sacramento County, California; Washington County, Maryland; and Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each site, and all participants provided informed consent. Exclusions were being institutionalized, in-home wheelchair-bound, or undergoing cancer treatment. Based on the aim of studying risk factors from early older adulthood, our analytic sample was restricted to the 3436 participants who were 65–74 years old at the baseline visit. We additionally excluded: 233 participants who had missing MBRF data; 39 participants who died within 1 year of baseline; and 13 who had evidence of cognitive impairment per the criteria described below at baseline. We also excluded 2 participants who had no follow-up data and 10 people missing basic covariate data. This resulted in an analytic sample of 3139 participants.

Outcome measure:

The main outcomes reflected absolute and relative cognitive healthspan: (1) remaining number of CHLYs; and (2) remaining percentage of life years (LYs) that were CHLYs ((CHLYs / LY) x 100, abbreviated here as %CHLYs). Remaining LYs were the number of years until mortality determined using death certificates, medical records, and other sources (as described previously)(35). We estimated CHLYs by pooling information from multiple sources collected during follow-up phone calls (conducted every six-months) and annual clinic visits. We defined CHLYs as the number of years before the development of significant cognitive decline which was ascertained using a number of different data sources: 1. Dementia diagnosis defined via adjudication in the CHS Cognition Study(36) or indicative inpatient/outpatient ICD-9 codes (290.xx, 294.xx, 331.0, 331.1, 331.2, 331.82, 331.83, 331.9 or 438.0); 2. Cognitive performance indicating likely impairment, i.e., at least 2 consecutive modified mini-mental (3MS) examination 3MS(37) scores of &lt;80 (38) and 10 points below a participant’s 3MS predicted score based on age, race, sex, and years of education (missing data imputed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (39) as done previously (40)) or a drop of &gt; 5 points from the initial 3MS score for 2 consecutive visits or at the last cognitive test and no subsequent recovery of scores to within 5 of the initial score; 3. Proxy report of decline, i.e., two instances of interviews done with a proxy due to participant cognitive impairment or a final proxy interview due to participants cognitive impairment or a final Informant Questionnaire for Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (41) score &gt;= 3.6; or 4. Dementia medication use, i.e., Aricept, Ariceptodt, Cognex, Donepezil, Donepezihcl, Exelon, Exelonpatch, Galantamine, Memantine, Namenda, Razadyne, Razadyneer, Rivastigmine and Tacrine. While recognizing that these sources do not necessarily indicate a dementia diagnosis, meeting any of these criteria provides evidence of compromised cognitive health. Therefore, CHLYs estimates the absolute cognitive healthspan, defined as the number of years lived before either signs of poor cognitive health (those listed above) or death.

The %CHLY outcome was used to assess relative cognitive healthspan, i.e., if any risk factors had a greater association with CHLYs than LYs. For example, consider that in the absence of a hypothetical risk factor, remaining CHLYs and LYs are both 20. If the presence of the risk factor is associated with instead 16 CHLYs and LYs (equal effects of four less CHLYs and LYs), the absolute CHLYs and LYs are reduced, but the %CHLYs is still 100%. In contrast, if the risk factor is associated with four lower CHLYs (16) but LYs stay the same (at 20), then the %CHLYs would be lower (80%). Since both main outcomes (absolute and relative cognitive healthspan) depend on LYs, to facilitate interpretations, we secondarily report associations of MBRFs with LYs.

Potential risk factors:

(1) Poor diet was defined as being in the lowest quartile of the sample for Alternative Healthy Eating Index scores (42). (2) Physical inactivity was initially characterized in three ways, as whether participants were: in the lowest quartile of kilocalories expended in physical activity calculated using the Modified Minnesota Leisure-Time Activity Questionnaire (43); (b) being in the lowest quartile in terms of the number of blocks walks per week; and (c) reporting no exercise (as opposed to low/medium/high intensity) as defined previously (44). (3) Sleep disturbances were measured using four questions: (a) do you usually have trouble falling asleep?; (b) do you usually wake up several times at night?; (c) do you usually wake up far too early?; (d) and are you usually sleepy in the daytime? (4) Depression symptoms were defined as having modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scores ≥ 10 (45).

Covariates:

We considered the following main potential confounding variables and entered them as covariates in all models: age, sex, race (white versus non-white), education (less than high school, high school or GED, some college or vocational school, versus college or more), and field center. We also examined if alcohol use (categorized based on the number of drinks per week) and smoking status (never, former, or current) were associated with the outcomes; if so, we also entered these factors as covariates in models of MBRF combinations.

Statistical analysis:

We used separate linear regression models for each of the primary outcomes. We initially used separate models for each individual MBRF and outcome (main covariates included). These initial models provided association effect size estimates for the individual factors. We also used these initial models for variable selection for the two MBRFs that had multiple variables: there were 4 sleep questions and three physical activity measures. Within these domains, we evaluated the pattern of association effect size and statistical significance to select the measures that were potentially relevant (to the main outcomes) for subsequent modeling of MBRF combinations. In these subsequent models, we used a count of the selected MBRF variables as a predictor variable (adjusted for the main covariates plus smoking status based on its relevance to the outcomes; see below).

Finally, we used models to evaluate the statistical effects of MBRF pairs. For each potential MBRF pair, we compared having neither (the references) against having one of the factors alone, the other factor alone, or both. Given that there were 10 MBRF pairs, this resulted in 30 inferential statistics for each outcome (e.g., for each pair, we had three p-values ((1) MBRF1 alone versus neither, (2) MBRF2 alone vs. neither, (3) and MBRF1 combined with MBRF2 vs. neither)). For these discovery-based/exploratory models, we report a Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (46)(q-value) that was calculated to account for the 30 comparisons made for each outcome.

Results

Sample characteristics:

Participants were 69.5 years old on average when MBRFs were measured (standard deviation (SD) = 2.5). The sample was predominately white and individuals were well-distributed across a range of educational attainment categories (Table 1). The hypothesized risk factors ranged in prevalence (Table 2), e.g., 62% reported waking up several times at night, ~12% met the criteria for depression symptoms, and 6.5% were categorized has having “no exercise.” Note that the physical activity and eating variables were arbitrarily categorized (in quartiles) and therefore did not have meaningful prevalence rates.

Absolute and relative cognitive healthspan:

Participants averaged 16.0 (SD = 6.9; range: 1.1–26) remaining LYs, of which an average of 12.2 (SD = 6.6; range: 0.6–26) were CHLYs. The average %CHLYs was 78.1% (SD = 25.6; range = 3.6–100). There was only a small correlation between years of life remaining and the %CHLYs (Pearson r = −0.15), indicating that high %CHLYs levels were not driven simply by shorter lifespans. Outcome distributions were similar across surviving and deceased participants (87.5% of the sample died during follow-up).

Associations of individual MBRFs with cognitive healthspan:

Each individual MBRF variable was associated with fewer overall LYs and CHLYs (Table 2). Almost all of these associations were statistically robust and around 1 to 2 years fewer estimated LYs and CHLYs. In contrast, associations of individual factors with the %CHLY outcome were not statistically robust. The only effect size/p-value sets indicating a possible association of individual factors with a lower %CHLY were daytime sleepiness, early morning awakenings, depression symptoms, the fewest blocks walked per week category and the worst diet category. We selected these five variables for further analysis, based on these findings, and our interest in examining combinations across these MBRF domains.

Also note that smoking (p&lt;0.001), but not alcohol use (p=0.12), was associated with the CHLY outcome. We therefore included smoking as an additional covariate in subsequent models.

Count of MBRFs in relation to cognitive healthspan:

Compared with having none of the MBRFs, having 1, 2, or 3+ MBRFs was associated with fewer CHLYs (Table 3). Associations with LYs and CHLYs were largest in magnitude for the group with 3+ MBRFs. Note that splitting the 3+ MBRF category further (to additional 4 and 5 MBRF categories) resulted in smaller groups, but yielded consistent results and a clearer gradient effect (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content).

Associations with %CHLY were less statistically robust. In these models of MBRF counts, the %CHLY was statistically lower only in people with 3+ MBRFs (an average of 5.7% less remaining LYs being CHLYs; p=0.001). The Figure illustrates the association of having 3+ MBRF with having not just fewer LYs and CHLYs, but a lower %CHLYs.

Pairs of MBRFs in relation to cognitive healthspan:

Finally, we used a series of models to examine whether particular MBRF pairs related to the outcomes (Table 4), as opposed to a simple count (e.g., any two of the MBRFs). Again, we observed that no individual factor was strongly statistically associated with the %CHLY outcome, although individual factors were related to absolute LYs and CHLYs. In contrast, seven of the ten risk factor pairs (versus neither) were associated with having a lower %CHLY (False Discover Rates &lt; 0.05); effect sizes ranged from point estimates of about 4 to 9 percent lower %CHLY. These MBRF pairs associated with a lower %CHLYs were: fewer blocks walked per week when combined with any of the other four factors examined; daytime sleepiness when combined with early awakenings or depression symptoms (note this was numerically the largest effect size for %CHLYs); and the combination of early awakening and depression.

Discussion

This report provides novel information on the distribution and behavioral health correlates of cognitive healthspan in older adults. Participants were assessed when 65–74 years old and lived an average of 12 more years, or 78% of their remaining life, before evidence of compromised cognitive function emerged. Results illustrate a wide range of variability in remaining lifespan and cognitive healthspan. Individual MBRFs (sleep complaints, depression symptoms, physical inactivity, and poor diet) at ages 65–74 predicted living about one or two fewer years. But individual MBRFs were not associated with significant variation from the average 78% remaining years that were CHLYs. In contrast, having multiple MBRFs predicted both shorter absolute and relative cognitive healthspans (see Figure and Tables 2/3). People with multiple MBRFs, on average, lived fewer years and spent a greater proportion of older adulthood in poor cognitive health.

These results confirm past observations which has shown that sleep disturbances (16), depression (17), physical inactivity (18), and poor diet (19) are associated with the risk for cognitive impairment (16–19) and mortality (47–50). Our findings extend past evidence in two main ways. First, by leveraging prospective data collected over decades, we provided a novel description of effects in terms of years of life and years before evidence of impaired cognitive function. This prospective analysis indicated that having only one of these common MBRFs is, on average, associated with having a modestly lower (1–2 year) absolute cognitive healthspan. Second, by examining overall levels (counts) of MBRFs, we documented how more pronounced, substantial, associations with cognitive healthspan are observed in people who have multiple MBRFs. At higher numbers of MBRFs, association effect sizes became greater for cognitive healthspan than for overall lifespan (Table S1, Supplemental Digital Content). Thus, at high levels of MBRFs, there were disproportionately larger associations with cognitive healthspans than with lifespan (i.e., predicted reductions in cognitive healthspan were greater than those of lifespan). As a result, people with high MBRF counts lived, on average, shorter lives and a greater portion of older adulthood with compromised cognitive health. This evidence indicates that interventions to promote both lifespan and cognitive lifespan are most needed for people aging with high MBRF counts.

Additional analyses highlighted the relevance of several MBRF pairs to having a lower %CHLY. We found that depression symptoms plus daytime sleepiness was the pair most markedly associated with having a lower %CHLYs (almost 10% lower). However, it is important to note that, based on these data, we cannot determine what mechanism(s) underlies the observed associations. For example, the statistical effect of having depression plus daytime sleepiness may be due to this group having the most severely/persistently impaired daytime function and reduced physical, psychosocial, and cognitive activity. But exactly which MBRF combinations to target, and how multiple MBRFs contribute together to brain and cognitive pathology, remains to be determined. The exposure measures used here were often single questionnaire items self-reported in 1989–1990. More detailed and/or objective assessments are required to confirm and/or add nuance to our findings. For instance, objective measures of activity patterns may provide a stronger/more specific signal (and target) when compared with self-reported city block-equivalents walked per week or subjective sleep complaints.

There are several other important limitations to note. These were correlational analyses of observational data that cannot confirm causality. Exposure measures were taken, on average, many years before outcome ascertainment; and prevalent outcome cases from baseline were excluded. But it remains possible that subclinical pathological processes could have led to both the observed MBRF presentations and CHLY outcomes. Due to this potential for unmeasured confounding, findings here do not attest to which active process(es) these associations reflect.

Nevertheless, our findings provide evidence that combinations of MBRFs signal high risk for early mortality and an even earlier end to the cognitive healthspan. As such, people with the MBRF combinations identified as relevant here (three or more and the pairs listed above) may be most in most need of aggressive multi-component dementia prevention approaches. Future work is needed to replicate these observations as more recent cohorts age and to characterize the process(es) linking MBRF combinations with cognitive outcomes. Experimental studies may also be warranted to ascertain if integrated, multifactorial, treatments are more efficacious when compared with approaches that treat MBRFs separately. For example, multi-arm trials may be warranted to test if effects of targeting physical inactivity alone, versus targeting physical inactivity plus depression and/or sleep problems, has greater effects in terms of enhancing target engagement, mechanistic effects, and preserving cognitive function.

All estimates from separate regression models for each outcome (LY, CHLY, and %CHLY. Models were all adjusted for age, sex, race, education, field site, and smoking status. The reference category for all estimates is “neither.” We correct for the multiple comparisons within each outcome (i.e., 30 comparisons) by reporting False Discover Rates (q-values) instead of p-values.
