While ketone bodies support overall brain energy metabolism, it is increasingly clear specific brain cell types respond differently to ketone body availability. Here, we characterized how SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell, primary neuron, and primary astrocyte bioenergetics and nutrient sensing pathways respond to β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB). SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons, but not astrocytes, exposed to βOHB increased respiration and decreased PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling. Despite increased carbon availability and respiration, SH-SY5Y cells treated with βOHB reduced their overall metabolic activity and cell cycling rate. Levels of the quiescence-regulating Yamanaka factors increased to a broader extent in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons. We propose a βOHB-induced increase in neuron respiration, accompanied by activation of quiescence associated pathways, could alleviate bioenergetic stress and limit cell senescence. This in turn could potentially benefit conditions, including brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases, that feature bioenergetic decline and cell senescence.

pmc1. Introduction

There is interest in using keto-therapeutics to treat neurologic disorders (Koppel and Swerdlow, 2018). During starvation or carbohydrate restriction the liver catabolizes mobilized adipose fat to ketone bodies which enter the bloodstream, access the brain, and support brain bioenergetics. The mechanistic impact of ketone bodies, though, extends beyond generating ATP. β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB), the major ketone body by blood concentration, inhibits histone deacetylases, increases histone acetylation, and alters gene transcription (Shimazu et al., 2013). In mouse vascular tissue βOHB prevents the accumulation of senescent cells by inducing the quiescence regulator octamer-binding transcriptional factor 4 (Oct4, POU5F1) (Han et al., 2018).

With brain bioenergetics, different cell types interact to achieve homeostasis. We recently reported mice maintained on a ketogenic diet (KD) increased expression of genes that support oxidative phosphorylation and insulin signaling in neurons, but not in astrocytes (Koppel et al., 2021). Comparisons of neurons and astrocytes revealed other differentially affected pathways. These data are consistent with an emerging appreciation that astrocytes support neuron bioenergetics. While disputed, some evidence has suggested astrocytes perform aerobic glycolysis to produce lactate, which they export to neurons to fuel their respiration (Bouzier-Sore et al., 2003; Dienel, 2013; Liu et al., 2017; Stobart and Anderson, 2013). A similar relationship may exist for fatty acids and ketone bodies (Guzman and Blazquez, 2001), as astrocytes can perform fatty acid oxidation to produce ketone bodies that transfer to neurons (Auestad et al., 1991; Blázquez et al., 1998).

Here, to clarify how ketone bodies impact neurons versus astrocytes we treated human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with βOHB and characterized acute and chronic effects on mitochondrial function and cell nutrient sensing pathways. We further extended our studies to primary rat neurons and astrocytes. We found SH-SY5Y cell responses frequently recapitulated those of primary neurons, and that neuron and astrocyte responses frequently differed. βOHB increased mitochondrial respiration and histone acetylation, and reduced activation of the nutrient sensing PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, in SH-SY5Y cells and primary neurons but not in astrocytes. βOHB increased Oct4 in neurons and astrocytes, while activating a more generalized expression of Yamanaka factors in neurons and SH-SY5Y cells.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1 SH-SY5Y Cell Cultures

SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, which are not currently recognized as a commonly misidentified cell by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee, were cultured in DMEM (Gibco #11966) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). D-glucose was supplemented to a final concentration of 1 g/L D-glucose. Medium was exchanged daily. Cells were passaged for a maximum number of 20 passages during the course of experiments. Vehicle-treated cells were supplemented with an additional 4 mM NaCl while βOHB-treated cells were cultured in freshly prepared medium supplemented with 4 mM (R)-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid sodium salt (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. sc-229050A). Enantiomeric βOHB was selected for this study over other exogenous supplementation methods because it rapidly dissolves in solution. Ketone esters and MCT formulations are more typically utilized for parenteral supplementation for in vivo studies as they require conversion from enteric esterases or first pass liver metabolism to raise ketone levels in the blood (Soto-Mota et al., 2020). A 4 mM concentration was selected as this represents a moderate degree of ketosis observed in nutritional ketosis states (Castellano et al., 2015; Courchesne-Loyer et al., 2017; Croteau et al., 2018). Cultures were considered chronically adapted to βOHB following seven days or greater (≥ 7 DIV) of βOHB exposure. Cultures were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2.

2.2 Primary Neuron and Astrocyte Cultures

The use of vertebrate animals was approved by the University of Kansas Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under Animal Care and Use Protocol #2015–2294. This study was not pre-registered with a governmental agency. Timed pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (MGI Cat# 5651135, RRID:MGI:5651135, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were obtained on embryonic days 12–13 of gestation (E12–13). Animals were singly housed with ad libitum access to food and water. On day E16 pregnant rats were euthanized via primary CO2 asphyxiation to minimize animal distress and secondary bilateral thoracotomy in the morning. A total of 10 rats were utilized for the present study. E16 embryos were removed upon necropsy and cortices obtained via dissection. Cortices were placed in digestion buffer containing 1-part TrypLE Express (Gibco #12604–021) to 2-parts Neurobasal medium (Gibco #21104–049) and incubated for 5 minutes at 37°C. Digested cortices were processed to single cell suspension via trituration and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 rcf for 3 minutes and washed in warmed neurobasal medium to remove excess TypLE.

Cell suspensions were split in half and re-pelleted. Neurobasal medium was removed, and one pellet was resuspended in primary neuron culture medium (Neurobasal medium with 1x B27 supplement (Gibco #17504–044), 25 μM L-glutamine, and 1% P/S) with the other resuspended in Astrocyte Growth Medium (DMEM/F12 1:1 (Gibco #11320–033) with 10% FBS and 1% P/S). Cells were plated on plastic cell culture plates pre-treated with poly-L-lysine and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. The day following isolation neuronal medium was replaced with medium containing cytosine arabinoside for 48 hours to arrest mitotically dividing cells and induce apoptosis of any cells other than post-mitotic neurons.

Neuronal cultures were maintained for a minimum of 7 days to allow for neurite extension and synapse formation. Astrocyte cultures were grown to confluence in T75 flasks. Upon reaching confluence flasks were gently shaken for 1 hour at 37°C to remove non-astrocytic glia. Media was removed, and astrocytes were passaged using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and plated into new dishes and grown to confluence.

Both neuron and astrocyte cultures were treated with vehicle or 4 mM βOHB-supplemented medium. Culture purity was determined through immunocytochemical staining with antibodies targeting microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Abcam #ab32454, RRID:AB_776174, 1:500 dilution) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Abcam #ab7260, RRID:AB_305808, 1:1000 dilution) for neurons and astrocytes respectively. Antibody labeling was visualized using AlexaFluor goat anti-rabbit 488 antibody (Abcam ab#150077, RRID:AB_2630356, 1:2000) with Hoescht 33342 (Invitrogen #H1399) counterstain and imaged using an epifluorescence microscope.

2.3 Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analysis

Two days prior to assay 20,000 SH-SY5Y cells were seeded per well in a Seahorse XF96 cell culture plate (Agilent #101085–004, RRID:SCR_019545). Primary neurons and astrocytes were plated at a density of 100,000 cells per well. Cells were seeded in 100 μL complete media, either vehicle or treatment medium, and held for 1 hour at room temperature before moving to a 37°C incubator at 5% CO2. An additional 100 μL of medium was added four hours later and cells were incubated overnight. The following day medium was exchanged to the designated treatment medium, and cells were incubated overnight.

The next day all but 50 μL of medium was removed and cells were washed twice with 200 μL of assay medium with supplemental NaCl or sodium βOHB salt for vehicle and treatment conditions respectively as described above (Seahorse XF Base Media supplemented with 1 g/L D-glucose and 2 mM L-glutamine). After the final wash mitochondrial stress test assays were performed as previously described (Weidling et al., 2020) using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer comparing NaCl and βOHB supplemented media conditions (Agilent Technologies, Inc., RRID:SCR_019545, Santa Clara, CA). Following completion of stress test assays, Hoechst 33342 was injected into each well at a final concentration of 2 μg/mL in assay medium to stain nuclei. Individual wells were imaged using the BioTek Cytation 1 imaging platform and Seahorse well data was normalized to the nearest 1,000 cells per well prior to data analysis (Agilent Technologies, Inc., BioTek Cytation 1 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader, RRID:SCR_019730, Santa Clara, CA).

2.4 ADP/ATP and NAD+/NADH Measurements

ADP/ATP ratios were determined using an ADP/ATP Ratio Assay Kit (Sigma #MAK135) per manufacturer instructions. NAD+/NADH ratios were determined using an NAD/NADH Glo Assay Kit per manufacturer instructions (Promega #G9071).

2.5 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Measurements

To perform tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) (ThermoFisher #T669) staining, SH-SY5Y cells were plated and treated with 20 μM FCCP for 1 hour as a positive control. Medium was aspirated and fresh treatment medium supplemented with 1 μM TMRE and 1 μg/mL Hoescht 33342, and cells were returned to the incubator for 30 minutes. Medium was aspirated and HBSS added. Cells were immediately imaged at 20x magnification using a Biotek Cytation1 automated microscope. Images were analyzed for TMRE per cell intensity using BioTek Gen5 software.

For JC-1 staining, a 2 μM working concentration of JC-1 (ThermoFisher #T3168) was applied to SH-SY5Y cells in a 96 well plate in treatment medium for 30 minutes at 37°C. Medium was aspirated and replaced with HBSS. Fluorescence was measured at Excitation/Emission spectra of 490/590 nm and 490/529 nm for red and green fluorescence respectively, and ratioed to determine dye incorporation into mitochondria.

Nonyl acridine orange (NAO) incorporation into mitochondria is sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential (Rodriguez et al., 2008). For NAO (ThermoFisher #A1372) staining, a 100 nM working concentration was added in treatment medium. Medium was aspirated and NAO-containing medium applied for 15 minutes at 37°C. Medium was aspirated and cells detached from plates using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Cells were pelleted at 400 rcf for 3 minutes. Trypsin was aspirated and cells washed in HBSS. Pelleting and resuspension was repeated with cells resuspended in HBSS on ice. NAO intensity was measured by FACS analysis using a BD FACSAria II cytometer (RRID:SCR_018091, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

2.6 Autophagy Flux Assay

SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 6 cm dishes and grown to confluency in treatment medium. On the assay day, medium was exchanged to medium containing 100 nM bafilomycin (Sigma #B1793) for 6 hours. Cells were washed in PBS and whole cell lysates generated. LC3BII to LC3BI ratios were determined by Western blot between bafilomycin treated and untreated samples to determine autophagy flux (Cell Signaling Technologies (CST) #3868, RRID:AB_2137707, 1:1000 dilution). Protein levels of NDP52, BNIP3, and Nix/BNIP3L were also used to investigate mitophagy flux (CST #60732 RRID:AB_2732810, #44060 RRID:AB_2799259, and #12396 RRID:AB_2688036 respectively, 1:1000 dilutions for all were used).

2.7 MTT Assay

For MTT-based approximations of cell metabolic activity, 60,000 SH-SY5Y cells were plated per well in 96-well flat bottom plastic plates. On the assay day 0.5 mg/mL thiazoyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagent was prepared in treatment medium and filter-sterilized (Sigma #M2128). Medium was aspirated from cells and 100 μL of MTT- containing medium was applied and mixed by gentle shaking. Cells were returned to a 37°C incubator for 3.5 hours. Medium was aspirated so as not to disturb the cell layer. 100 μL DMSO was added per well. Absorbance was measured at λ = 540 nm.

2.8 Cell Cycle and Growth Analysis

Cells previously adapted to treatment conditions were passaged using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, uniformly distributed into 6 cm plastic dishes at a density of 100,000 cells/dish and with passage serving as timepoint t = 0. Cells were collected via scraping in 200 μL ice-cold PBS following medium aspiration at 24-hour intervals for 3 days. 20 μL cell suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue stain (ThermoFisher #T10282). Stained cells were loaded onto chamber slides and cell number per mL of solution measured using a Cell Countess automated counter (Invitrogen #C10227). The count per mL was multiplied by total volume of recovered cell suspension and used to approximate the total cell count to the nearest 1,000 cells. Doubling time was estimated using a Malthusian growth curve analysis performed with GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 software (GraphPad Software, RRID:SCR_002798, San Diego, CA).

To determine the effects of βOHB on cell cycle progression through cell synchronization at the G1/S checkpoint and release with propidium iodide staining, adapted cells were passaged as described above. The next day medium was exchanged to treatment medium supplemented with 2.5 mM thymidine for 20 hours. Cells were washed with PBS and released into treatment medium for 9 hours. A second 4-hour thymidine block was performed. Cells were washed again and released and collected at 3-hour intervals for up to 24 hours. Collected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and collected in 1 mL cold PBS. 2.5 mL of 90% ice-cold EtOH was added dropwise during gentle agitation to fix and permeabilize cells. Cells were washed and resuspended in cold PBS following centrifugation and stained in 1 mL PBS containing 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma #P4864) and 1 mg/mL RNase A (ThermoFisher #EN0531). DNA was measured by FACS analysis using a BD FACSAria II cytometer.

2.9 Cell Death Assay

Cell death was measured via TUNEL assay per manufacturer instructions (Abcam #ab66108). Cell death was measured via FACS within 3 hours of staining.

2.10 Generation of Whole Cell Lysates and Western Blot Immunochemistry

Cells were seeded at similar concentrations in 6-well plates (Corning costar #3516). Lysates were generated and Western immunoblotting performed as described previously (Weidling et al., 2020). Blocked membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight on an orbital shaker in primary antibody diluted in 5% BSA in TBST (pT308 Akt CST #2965, RRID:AB_2255933, 1:1000, pS473 Akt LifeTechnologies #700392 1:1000, Total Akt CST #4685, RRID:AB_2225340, 1:1000, Acetyl-H3K9 CST #9649, RRID:AB_823528, 1:1000, pS79 ACC1 CST #3661, RRID:AB_330337, 1:1000, Total ACC1 CST #3676, RRID:AB_2219397, 1:1000, β-tubulin CST #2146, RRID:AB_2210545, 1:1000, Total Histone 3 CST #4499, RRID:AB_10544537, 1:2000, Oct4 abcam #ab18976, RRID:AB_444714, 1:1000, pT389 p70 S6 Kinase CST #9206, RRID:AB_2285392, 1:500, Total p70 S6 Kinase CST #2708, RRID:AB_390722, 1:1000, pS293 PDHE1α abcam #ab177461, RRID:AB_2756339, 1:1000, Total PDHE1α abcam #ab92696, RRID:AB_10711672, 1:1000). The following day membranes were washed 3 times for 5 minutes in TBST followed by a 1-hour incubation at room temperature in the appropriate secondary antibody (Invitrogen Superclonal Secondary Antibody, HRP Conjugate #A28177 or #A27036), diluted 1:4000 in 5% condensed milk in TBST. Membranes were washed 3 times for 5 minutes prior to visualization using Supersignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo #34096) on a BioRad Chemidoc XRS+ imager. Densitometry was performed using Image Lab software (BioRad) with protein levels normalized to either β-tubulin or total protein determined by amido black stain (Sigma #A8181).

2.11 RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR

RNA isolation and cDNA generation were performed as described previously using an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus Real Time PCR system (96 well) (Applied Biosystems #4346906) (Weidling et al., 2020). Taqman primers used in the present study included 18S Hs03003631_g1, myc Hs00153408_m1, POU5F1 Hs00999634_gH, Sox2 Hs04234836_s1, and 18S serving as a housekeeping gene. qPCR was performed per master mix instructions

2.12 Lipid Droplet Staining, Triglyceride Assay, and Cholesterol Staining

Lipid droplets were identified with BODIPY 493/503 (ThermoFisher #D3922). 1 mg/mL stock solution was used to create a 1:500 dilution in treatment medium. Half the medium was removed from cultured cells and a 1:500 dilution applied to achieve a 1:1,000 dilution working concentration. Hoescht 33342 was added as a nuclear stain at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C and washed in PBS. Cells were placed in PBS and imaged using the 20x objective of a Cytation1 automated microscope.

Triglycerides were measured with a Triglyceride Quantification Assay Kit (Abcam #ab65336). Cells were collected in 5% NP-40 in water and heated to 80°C for 5 minutes. Cell lysates were cooled to room temperature and a cycle of heating and cooling repeated. Lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed for 2 minutes, supernatant collected, and samples diluted 10-fold with water. 50 μL of triglyceride standards and sample were loaded in duplicate onto a 96-well clear, flat bottom plate. 2 μL lipase enzyme was added per well and the plates placed at room temperature for 20 minutes. 50 μL of triglyceride reaction mix containing probe, enzyme mix, and triglyceride assay buffer were added and plates incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Absorbance was measured within two hours at λ = 570 nm. A portion of the lysate supernatant was analyzed by BCA assay for normalization of triglyceride content to protein per sample.

Cell cholesterol was quantified using a Cholesterol Assay Kit (Abcam #ab13316). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in 96-well black-walled flat bottom plates. Medium was aspirated and a cultured cells kit fixative solution applied for 10 minutes. Cells were washed 3 times for 5 minutes each before adding 100 μL of working concentration filipin III stain for 30 minutes in the dark. Cells were washed an additional two times for 5 minutes each. NucGreen 488 staining followed the final wash (ThermoFisher #R37109). Cells were imaged at 20x magnification using a Cytation1.

2.13 mtDNA, Nuclear DNA Extraction, and mtDNA:Nuclear DNA Ratio Quantification

SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 6 well dishes. DNA extraction and ratio quantification were performed as described previously (Weidling et al., 2020).

2.14 Statistical Analyses

Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were n = 12 per group where n is the number of independent cell culture preparations. This was determined based upon power calculations to be able to detect a 20% mean difference between groups with a variance of 20% of the mean and power of 80% which indicated a minimum of 10 samples per independent group. Normality of data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilks test in SPSS v26. Assessment of outliers was performed using the ROUT method in GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 with q = 1%. No outliers were identified by this method. Data were summarized as means with standard deviations or standard errors. To compare means between two groups we used unpaired two-tailed Student’s T-tests. To compare means between three or more groups where only one variable was manipulated experimentally, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine initial significance followed by Tukey’s post hoc testing. To compare means between three or more groups where two variables were manipulated experimentally, we used two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons testing between groups. To estimate cell doubling time we used exponential (Malthusian) growth curves to determine best fit. A statistically significant outcome was determined by p-values &lt;0.05. No randomization or blinding was used to allocate or evaluate individual cell wells in this study. All statistical calculations used GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 software.

3. Results

3.1 βOHB enhances SH-SY5Y cell mitochondrial respiration while altering ADP/ATP and NAD+/NADH ratios

We considered whether SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells perform βOHB ketolysis. Sustained βOHB exposure increased basal respiration (Fig. 1A–B mean ± SD, p &lt; 0.0001 one-way ANOVA). Basal ECARs were comparable across conditions (p = 0.0625 one-way ANOVA), although post-hoc analysis indicated a trend towards reduced ECAR with chronic βOHB (Fig. 1A&amp;C Tukey’s post-hoc Vehicle vs Chronic p = 0.0499). The ATP production rate increased with both acute and sustained βOHB (Fig. 1D p &lt; 0.0001 one-way ANOVA) while coupling efficiency declined due to elevated proton leak rates (Fig. 1E p &lt; 0.0001 one-way ANOVA). Spare and maximum respiratory capacities did not change (data not shown).

We measured the impact of βOHB on SH-SY5Y cell ADP/ATP and NAD+/NADH ratios. Chronic, but not acute, βOHB reduced the ADP/ATP ratio (Fig. 1F p &lt; 0.0001 one-way ANOVA). Chronic, but not acute, βOHB increased the NAD+/NADH ratio (Fig. 1G p = 0.0011 one-way ANOVA).

3.2 βOHB reduces SH-SY5Y cell mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm)

We evaluated βOHB-treated SH-SY5Y cells with dyes whose uptake is sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψm). TMRE labeling indicated reduced Ψm with chronic βOHB (Fig. 2A–B mean ± SD, p &lt; 0.0001 one-way ANOVA). FCCP served as a positive control. JC1 showed a reduced red/green ratio following both 24 hours and chronic βOHB conditions (Fig. 2C p = 0.0010 one-way ANOVA). Mitochondrial nonyl acridine orange uptake was reduced by 24-hour and chronic βOHB treatment (Fig. 2D p &lt; 0.0001 one-way ANOVA).

3.3 βOHB increases SH-SY5Y cell autophagic capacity and mitochondrial mass

Reduced mitochondrial membrane potential can initiate mitophagy. An autophagy flux assay that used bafilomycin to inhibit lysosome digestion of autophagosome contents revealed an increased LC3BII/LC3BI ratio in cells chronically maintained in βOHB (Fig. 3A–B mean ± SD, p = 0.0093 by two-way ANOVA). Bafilomycin-induced changes in the LC3BII/LC3BI ratio were proportionally equivalent across the null, acute, and chronic βOHB conditions. We noted a similar pattern in the levels of mitophagy adaptor protein NDP52 (Fig. 3A,C p = 0.0045 two-way ANOVA). Chronic βOHB-treated cells exposed to bafilomycin contained more BNIP3, a protein that modifies Ψm to initiate mitophagy (Fig. 3A,D p = 0.0009 by two-way ANOVA). Neither acute nor chronic βOHB definitively altered Nix/BNIP3L (Fig. 3A,E p = 0.0608 by two-way ANOVA), although post-hoc analysis via Tukey’s test revealed an elevated trend in the chronic βOHB-treated cells (p = 0.0274).

To approximate relative amounts of mitochondrial mass we isolated genomic DNA from SH-SY5Y cells and performed qPCR on mtDNA and nDNA targets. MT-ND1 was referenced to β2M under different treatment conditions. Our ΔΔCt analysis found both 24-hour and chronic βOHB increased the relative mtDNA copy number (Fig. 3F p = 0.0003 by one-way ANOVA).

3.4 βOHB slows SH-SY5Y cell metabolic activity and reduces cycling without reducing viability

Since chronic βOHB increased mitochondrial respiration and shifted the ADP/ATP ratio in favor of ATP, we used an MTT assay to assess overall SH-SY5Y cell metabolic activity. 24-hour and chronic βOHB-treated cells showed a reduced ability to reduce formazan dye relative to vehicle (Fig. 4A mean ± SD, p &lt; 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA). To ensure βOHB was not lethal, a TUNEL assay was performed and did not show increased cell death (Fig. 4B).

Given the observed reduction in general metabolic activity, we assessed cell division rates. By day 3, βOHB-treated cells were less numerous than cells grown in the vehicle medium (Fig. 4C p &lt; 0.0001 by unpaired t-test). A Malthusian growth best fit analysis estimated βOHB increased the doubling time from 17.40 hours to 30.22 hours. To determine if the reduced cell growth rate was due to an altered progression through a specific part of the cell cycle, we performed propidium iodide cell cycle analysis following double thymidine synchronization and release. The greatest difference was observed at 18-hours post release with an accumulation of cells in the G0–G1 phase in the βOHB treated cells (Fig. 4D–E p &lt; 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA).

3.5 βOHB reduces SH-SY5Y cell PI3K-Akt-mTOR activation and induces Yamanaka factor transcription

Because mTOR regulates the G1 to S transition during mitotic division we assessed the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (Fig. 5A–B). Chronic βOHB treatment reduced Akt phosphorylation at its T308 and S473 activation sites while also increasing the total Akt level. The downstream target p70 S6 Kinase demonstrated reduced phosphorylation at its T389 activation site when measured alone, although significance was lost when normalized to total p70 S6 Kinase (p = 0.0710 by unpaired t-test).

βOHB-induced reductions in metabolic activity, growth rate, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR activation suggested a concomitant induction of cellular quiescence. We found chronic exposure increased histone 3 acetylation at lysine 9 (Fig. 5C p = 0.0021 and 0.0286 for acetyl and acetyl/total H3K9 respectively). We also measured transcript levels of the quiescence-regulating Yamanaka factors Oct4 (POU5F1), myc, Sox2, and Klf4 to determine whether their expression was activated. Both 24-hour and chronic βOHB increased Oct4 mRNA, while Sox2 mRNA only increased with chronic exposure. Myc levels trended upwards with chronic treatment. We did not detect transcripts for Klf4 in any of the treatment groups (Fig. 5D p = 0.0050, 0.0278, and 0.0102 respectively by one-way ANOVA).

3.6 βOHB reduces SH-SY5Y cell AMPK activation, increases lipid droplets, and reduces triglyceride and cholesterol content

To better assess how βOHB signaled nutrient scarcity we interrogated AMPK activity. AMPK phosphorylates ACC1, and cells exposed to chronic βOHB showed reduced S79 ACC1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A–B p = 0.0190 by unpaired t-test). As ACC1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step for de novo lipogenesis we used BODIPY staining with lipid droplet counting to measure lipid content. βOHB increased the number of lipid droplets per cell (Fig. 6C–D p &lt; 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA). We also measured cell triglycerides directly and found chronic βOHB reduced triglyceride content (Fig. 6E p &lt; 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA).

Since malonyl-CoA produced by ACC1 serves as a substrate for cholesterol synthesis, we determined whether βOHB altered cell cholesterol content. 24-hour and chronic βOHB reduced filipin III intensity (Fig. 6F–G p = 0.0003 by one-way ANOVA). To expand on possible alterations in mitochondrial carbon flux, we assessed phosphorylation of the primary catalytic subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, PDHE1α, which is performed by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. βOHB increased levels of the PDHE1α inhibitory phosphorylation (Fig. 6H–I p = 0.0029 by unpaired t-test).

3.7 βOHB’s effect on the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is cell-type dependent

We extended selected measurements to rat primary neurons and astrocytes whose status we verified (Fig. 7A–B). Like SH-SY5Y cells, βOHB-treated primary neurons exhibited reduced Akt phosphorylation at both regulation sites (p = 0.0035 and 0.0161 for pT308 and pS473 by unpaired t-test respectively). βOHB-treated neurons demonstrated increased histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (p = 0.0065 by unpaired t-test) and Oct4 protein (p = 0.0461 by unpaired t-test) (Fig. 7C&amp;E).

Unlike neurons, βOHB-treated primary rat astrocytes showed increased Akt T308 phosphorylation (Fig. 7D&amp;F p = 0.0363 by unpaired t-test). While pS473 was reduced as in neurons (p = 0.0498 by unpaired t-test), βOHB-treated astrocytes did not increase histone acetylation (p &gt; 0.9999 by unpaired t-test). Astrocytes also exhibited only a single Oct4 band under vehicle conditions and a doublet with increased protein levels when treated with βOHB (p = 0.0017).

3.8 βOHB enhanced primary neuron basal and ATP production-associated respiration

We performed mitochondrial stress tests on primary neurons and found chronic βOHB increased basal respiration (Fig. 8A–B p &lt; 0.0001 by unpaired t-test). Chronic βOHB treatment primary neurons also increased their basal ECAR (Fig. 8A&amp;C p = 0.0368 by unpaired t-test). Chronic βOHB increased primary neuron ATP production (Fig. 8D p = 0.0009 by unpaired t-test) and leak rates (Fig. 8E p = 0.0023 by unpaired t-test); the increased leak rate did not associate with a significant reduction in coupling percentage (Fig. 8F p = 0.5084 by unpaired t-test). βOHB increased maximum respiration (Fig. 8G p &lt; 0.0001 by unpaired t-test) but not spare capacity (Fig. 8H p = 0.2033 by unpaired t-test). Chronic βOHB additionally increased non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption (Fig. 8I p = 0.0050 by unpaired t-test).

3.9 βOHB does not alter primary astrocyte basal fluxes but increases respiratory capacity and improves mitochondrial efficiency

βOHB did not increase astrocyte basal respiration (Fig. 9A–B p = 0.9603 by unpaired t-test), basal ECAR (Fig. 9A&amp;C p = 0.7461 by unpaired t-test), or ATP production rates (Fig. 9D p= 0.4185 by unpaired t-test). The leak rate was lower with βOHB (Fig. 9E p = 0.0060 by unpaired t-test) and the coupling percentage increased (Fig. 9F p &lt; 0.0001 by unpaired t-test). βOHB increased the astrocyte maximum and spare respiratory capacities (Fig. 9G–H p = 0.0482 and 0.0010 respectively by unpaired t-test). Non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption did not change (Fig. 9I p = 0.9275 by unpaired t-test).

4. Discussion

We found neurons and astrocytes uniquely metabolize and respond to βOHB. βOHB increases respiration and induces uncoupling in primary rat neurons but not astrocytes. The SH-SY5Y cell response to βOHB more closely reflects that of primary neurons than primary glia. Acute and chronic exposures are not equivalent.

Our data show astrocytes do not primarily use βOHB to produce energy for themselves, although it does induce bioenergetic restructuring. In this case, enhanced astrocyte maximal respiration and spare capacity could reflect increased mitochondrial mass. Whereas in neurons increased mitochondrial mass could enhance energy production by facilitating respiratory chain throughput, in astrocytes increased mitochondrial mass may promote anabolic function.

βOHB alters mitochondrial biogenesis-mitophagy setpoints as we observed increased mitophagy markers in βOHB-treated SH-SY5Y cells, an apparently increased mitophagy flux, but elevated mtDNA copy number. These data are consistent with our recent finding that mouse neurons increase transcriptional pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation in response to a KD, whereas mouse astrocytes do not (Koppel et al., 2021), and raises the question of what astrocytes use ketone bodies for. Data from other investigators suggest in astrocytes, ketones provide a feed-forward mitochondrial biogenesis signal that enhances their intrinsic ketogenesis capacity (Le Foll et al., 2015a; Le Foll et al., 2014, 2015b; Le Foll and Levin, 2016).

Although NAD+/NADH ratios may vary between mitochondria and their surrounding cytosol, in both compartments this relationship regulates bioenergetic fluxes. An elevated NAD+/NADH ratio would predictably promote glucose utilization and carbon flow through the Krebs cycle. It is likely that this ratio shifted to a more oxidized state with ketone supplementation as catabolism of βOHB produces one reduced equivalent of NADH per molecule in comparison to glycolytic catabolism producing two NADH equivalents per molecule of glucose. During aging total NAD+ levels fall (Johnson and Imai, 2018), which would predictably slow multiple carbon fluxes. Countering this could activate NAD+ -sensitive enzymes, including the sirtuin family of deacetylases or the poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) (Julien et al., 2009; Lutz et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2015).

In SH-SY5Y cells βOHB inhibited the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway and slowed transition from the G1 to S phase. While SH-SY5Y cells and neurons reduced Akt phosphorylation but increased Akt protein, astrocyte total Akt protein levels fell. Reductions in PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling align with increased levels of Yamanaka factors, which induce quiescent behavior. Our data extend previous findings that βOHB induces Oct4 expression in vascular cells to CNS non-vascular cells (Han et al., 2018).

This raises a perplexing question of why quiescence-associated signaling pathways are activated in post-mitotic cells such as primary neurons. It has been shown that Oct4 ectopic expression in mouse retinal ganglion cells, a type of neuron, alters DNA methylation patterns, increases axon outgrowth following injury, and reverses vision loss in a mouse model of glaucoma (Lu et al., 2020). It is possible that Oct4 has other signaling roles, aside from inducing and maintaining pluripotency, that warrant further investigation in neuronal models.

While some parameters show βOHB signals nutrient scarcity, in SH-SY5Y cells less ACC1 phosphorylation indicates βOHB decreased AMPK activity. Reducing this inhibitory ACC1 modification should enhance lipogenesis and may account for increased SH-SY5Y cell lipid droplet formation. On the other hand, chronic βOHB reduced triglycerides and total cholesterol. It is puzzling why AMPK would not simply inhibit ACC1 to prevent futile cycling between acetyl-CoA and fats through de novo lipogenesis. One possibility is that lipids synthesized under ketosis conditions are purposed for packaging into exportable lipoproteins. A similar phenomenon occurs with lactate supplementation (Ladu et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2017; Mahley, 2016). One way to reconcile this overall dataset is to conclude βOHB can signal facets of nutrient scarcity in situations where nutrient scarcity does not actually exist.

The ability to simultaneously support bioenergetics while signaling nutrient scarcity could account for the KD’s ability to extend lifespan and preserve memory in aged mice (Newman et al., 2017). While it is tempting to consider that a KD may reduce mTOR activation by reducing insulin signaling, our current data suggest βOHB itself may confer this effect.

The aging brain accumulates senescent cells (Bussian et al., 2018; Holtzman and Ulrich, 2019; Masaldan et al., 2019; Musi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Senescence refers to an irreversible exit from the cell cycle and associates with an inflammatory state called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). It is important to distinguish senescence from quiescence, in which cells faced with nutrient scarcity reversibly exit the cell cycle. In that case, nutrient restoration prompts a return to cell growth and cycling. Quiescence can delay or prevent cell senescence in glia, which could benefit brain health by countering the evolution of a pro-inflammatory SASP state.

The SH-SY5Y line derives from a neuroblastoma tumor and tumor cell metabolism fundamentally differs from primary cell metabolism. We used SH-SY5Y cells as a vehicle for studying how ketone bodies fundamentally affect cell metabolism and not to serve as an exact model of neuronal function. We did find that βOHB-induced SH-SY5Y changes better reflect neuron over astrocyte responses. This has modeling implications and suggests SH-SY5Y cells can inform our understanding of neuron metabolism to at least a limited degree. They are easier to experimentally deploy than primary neurons although primary neurons offer other advantages. While primary neurons circumvent the confounds of tumor biology, though, they do not capture the complex metabolic interplay created by the different cell types found within the central nervous system. Further investigation is certainly warranted in more translatable model systems such as human derived iPSCs fated to neuronal and astrocytic phenotypes.

5. Conclusions

βOHB is a bioenergetic fuel that induces quiescent signaling programs in neurons and immature immortalized neuronal cells. Astrocyte bioenergetics are less affected by βOHB although astrocytes undergo a unique bioenergetic remodeling. Exploring these cell-specific responses may define mechanisms pertinent to brain aging and neurologic disease.
