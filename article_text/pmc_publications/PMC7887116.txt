Background and purpose:

The factors that predispose to relapse in patients recovering with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are largely unknown, complicating efforts to distinguish patients with resurgent symptoms who may benefit from additional immune-modulating therapies from those with other causes of impairment.

Methods:

We report a patient with AE with leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 autoantibodies with a typical presentation, but atypical course complicated by treatment-refractory psychoses and progressive cognitive decline. We leveraged emergent molecular PET biomarkers, including [18F]florbetapir (amyloid) and [18F]flortaucipir AV45 (tau) PET neuroimaging to evaluate for common neurodegenerative causes of impairment. The patient was followed until death and a brain autopsy performed.

Results:

No evidence of active inflammation was observed on neuroimaging or cerebrospinal fluid analyses in our patient with resurgent, treatment-refractory cognitive decline. [18F]Florbetapir and [18F]flortaucipir retention were increased in cerebral cortices in a pattern consistent with symptomatic Alzheimer disease. Immunomodulatory therapies were stopped, and appropriate counseling provided to the patient and family. The patient died 2.4 months following [18F]flortaucipir PET neuroimaging. Brain autopsy confirmed changes typical of Alzheimer disease without evidence of active inflammation or sequelae of AE, establishing Alzheimer disease as the likely cause of resurgent symptoms in this patient.

Conclusions:

Symptoms of age-related neurodegenerative illnesses may emerge following AE, particularly in older patients in whom neurodegenerative dementing illnesses are more common. Molecular biomarkers may aid in the evaluation of treatment-refractory patients with resurgent symptoms and signs, influencing management.

1. Introduction

Persistent impairment in memory, attention and executive function are increasingly well-recognized in patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) (Hebert et al. , 2018, Long and Day, 2018). As the optimal management of cognitive impairment depends on the cause, it is increasingly important to define whether deficits in individual patients are attributable to persistent inflammation (requiring further immunomodulatory therapy), the sequelae of immune-mediated damage (requiring supportive care), or other causes.

Long-term impairment in cognition is particularly frequent in patients with AE associated with antibodies against the neuronal cell-surface leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antigen (LGI1 antibody encephalitis) (Finke et al. , 2017, Gadoth et al. , 2017, Griffith et al. , 2020, Irani et al. , 2013, Loane et al. , 2019, Long and Day, 2018). LGI1 antibody encephalitis commonly affects patients later in life (Dalmau and Graus, 2018, Gadoth, Pittock, 2017), when common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), are most prevalent. Although the majority of patients respond to treatment with immunotherapies, refractory symptoms/signs are recognized (Endres et al. , 2020), with resurgent symptoms reported in up to 60% of patients (Gadoth, Pittock, 2017). The potential overlap between rare and common causes of cognitive impairment presents a unique challenge for the clinician who must determine whether resurgent or refractory symptoms are attributable to persistent inflammation, AE-mediated damage to neural networks, an emergent neurodegenerative disease process, or some combination of the above. Adding to the challenge, typical markers of neuroinflammation (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] leukocytosis) are commonly absent in older patients with LGI1 antibody encephalitis (Escudero et al. , 2017, Hebert et al. , 2020), while neuroimaging features of neurodegenerative disease (e.g., hippocampal atrophy) are common following LGI1 antibody encephalitis (Finke, Pruss, 2017, Gadoth, Pittock, 2017, Irani, Stagg, 2013, Loane, Argyropoulos, 2019). There is a need to identify clinically-accessible tools that can be applied to distinguish patients with persistent impairment attributable to active inflammation from those with impairment attributable to common neurodegenerative diseases. Sensitive and specific molecular biomarkers may be particularly well-suited to this task.

We report our experience with a patient with LGI1 antibody encephalitis who had a typical presentation, but atypical course complicated by treatment-refractory psychoses and progressive cognitive decline. We leveraged emergent molecular PET biomarkers of amyloid plaques ([18F]florbetapir) and tau neuropathology ([18F]flortaucipir) to assess the contributions of common neurodegenerative pathology to impairment. The patient was followed until death and brain autopsy performed permitting correlation of clinical, radiological and pathological findings.

2. Methods

2.1 Patient selection, evaluation and consent

The patient was evaluated and treated by experienced clinicians at Barnes Jewish Hospital (Saint Louis, Missouri, USA), and enrolled within prospective studies permitting longitudinal collection, monitoring of clinical data and neuroimaging studies, and banking of CSF. Clinical investigations and therapeutic recommendations were prescribed in accordance with standard-of-care. Patient data were previously incorporated within a case series exploring [18F]flortaucipir PET findings in LGI1 antibody encephalitis (Day et al., 2021). Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and their delegate for all study procedures, including brain-only autopsy. The Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) approved all study procedures.

2.2. Neuroimaging

Structural MR (Biograph mMR) and [18F]florbetapir and [18F]flortaucipir PET neuroimaging (Biograph 40 PET/CT; Siemens Medical Solutions; Erlanger, Germany) were performed as previously described (Day et al. , 2017, Day et al. , 2018). Briefly, T1-weighted images were acquired using magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo sequences, before cortical and subcortical parcellation was completed using FreeSurfer 5.3 (http://freesurfer.net), yielding 46 unique brain regions, corresponding to the Desikan atlas. PET imaging was performed following injection of 7.4–11.3 mCi of [18F]florbetapir or 6.8–10.9 mCi of [18F]flortaucipir, and data from the 50- to 70- minute and 80- to 100-minute post-injection windows converted to SUVRs, respectively, using the cerebellar cortex as a reference. Regional values were partial volume corrected using a geometric transfer matrix approach (Su et al. , 2015, Su et al. , 2013). For visualization, voxel-wise PET were aligned to the patient’s T1 images.

2.3 Cerebrospinal fluid biomarker measures

AD biomarkers (amyloid-β42, total-tau, phosphorylated-tau181) were measured in stored CSF using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assays (INNOTEST; Fujirebio [formerly Innogenetics], Ghent, Belgium). For amyloid-β42, published normal values were reported (Fagan et al. , 2007). For total-tau and phosphorylated-tau181, normal values were extrapolated from values reported in cognitively normal individuals (mean ±1 standard deviation) (Schindler et al. , 2018).

2.4 Neuropathologic assessment

Brain-only autopsy was performed by author R.J.P. in accordance with established protocols at Washington University School of Medicine (Cairns et al. , 2015). Microscopic analyses were performed by the Anatomic and Molecular Pathology Core Laboratory (Washington University School of Medicine), using a polymer-based detection system and instrumentation by Ventana Medical Systems. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with anti-Aβ (1–42, clone H31L21) and antiphosphorylated tau (clone AT8) antibodies to allow visualization of AD neuropathological change. Results were interpreted in accordance with established diagnostic criteria (Montine et al. , 2012).

3. Results

3.1 Case report

An 83-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of complex visual hallucinations, bizarre behavior, and brief right-sided intermittent jerking of the right hemi-face and arm, consistent with faciobrachial dystonic seizures. Structural brain MRI was normal. Hyponatremia (124 mEq/L) was noted. Cerebrospinal fluid white blood cells were at the upper limit of normal (5 × 106 cells/L). No CSF-specific oligoclonal bands were detected; protein and glucose were normal. No malignancy was identified on body CT. A diagnosis of LGI1 autoantibody encephalitis was suspected. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone (1g IV QD × 5) followed by an oral prednisone taper over 3 months. LGI1 autoantibodies were subsequently confirmed in serum using a fixed cell-based assay (not detected in CSF). Psychoses resolved within two months of treatment and the patient returned to independent living. Continued follow-up confirmed near-complete resolution of cognitive impairment. Bedside testing suggested mild persistent deficits in executive function (serial 7s), repetition and letter fluency (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]; total score = 24/30), with preserved delayed verbal recall (5/5).

Three years following her initial presentation, she presented with subacute-onset paranoid delusions. Deficits in executive function and delayed verbal recall (0/5) were noted on bedside exam (MoCA=13/30). MR brain and CSF were normal. LGI1 autoantibodies were not detected in serum or CSF. Recurrent AE was suspected, and empiric treatment provided with methylprednisolone (1 g IV QD × 5) and intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg over 5 days). She was discharged to an assisted living facility on oral prednisone.

Over the ensuing 12 months, cognition continued to decline (MoCA=13/30). Rituximab (375 mg/m2 Q week × 4) was administered without benefit. She required increasing assistance with instrumental activities of daily living and personal care. Delusions and hallucinations persisted. Noting progressive cognitive decline with behavioral disturbances despite, alternate causes of cognitive impairment were considered. [18F]florbetapir (amyloid) and [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET neuroimaging were obtained and were consistent with AD (Figure 1).

Immunomodulatory therapies were stopped, and an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor initiated for behavioral symptoms of dementia. Cognitive impairment with behavioral disturbance persisted until death at age 87 due to inanition (57.0 months following symptom-onset; 2.4 months following tau-PET). AD biomarkers were measured retrospectively in CSF banked following presentation with relapsing symptoms (3 years following initial presentation). Findings were consistent with AD, including low amyloid-beta42 (414 pg/mL; normal, &gt;500 pg/mL) and elevated phosphorylated-tau181 (119 pg/mL; normal, &lt;70 pg/mL). Total-tau levels were within normal limits (136 pg/mL; normal, &lt;360 pg/mL).

3.2 Neuropathological assessment

Brain autopsy demonstrated frequent diffuse and cored amyloid-beta plaques, regionally moderate neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and regionally dense neuropil threads, consistent with ‘intermediate’ AD neuropathologic change (A2,B2,C2) by NIA-AA criteria (Figure 2) (Montine, Phelps, 2012). No evidence of inflammation or sequelae of AE was detected.

4. Discussion

AE associated with LGI1 autoantibodies typically presents in patients &gt;60 years-of-age with subacute-onset of cognitive decline, psychoses, faciobrachial dystonic seizures and hyponatremia (Gadoth, Pittock, 2017, Irani et al. , 2010). Diagnostic criteria emphasize the importance of central nervous system inflammation on MRI and CSF analyses (Graus et al. , 2016). However, conventional markers of inflammation are often absent in older patients (Escudero, Guasp, 2017, Hebert, Gros, 2020). Our patient presented with classic LGI1 antibody encephalitis. The reemergence of treatment-refractory symptoms and progressive cognitive decline prompted consideration of alternative diagnoses, including common age-related neurodegenerative dementing diseases. A clinical diagnosis of AD was supported by amyloid- and tau-PET neuroimaging, and confirmed at autopsy. AD biomarkers, measured in stored CSF, were also consistent with AD.

This case offers several important insights. First, patients with rare neurologic diseases may develop common neurologic diseases. It is important to consider other causes of cognitive and behavioral change in recovering AE patients, acknowledging that reasonable exclusion of alternate causes is a part of AE diagnostic criteria (Graus, Titulaer, 2016). Neurodegenerative diseases, especially AD, become increasingly reasonable considerations as patients’ age, with prevalence exceeding 50% in individuals &gt;85 years (Rajan et al. , 2019). Second, while persistent cognitive complaints are common following LGI1 antibody encephalitis (Gadoth, Pittock, 2017), impairment is generally static or improves over time (Finke, Pruss, 2017, Gadoth, Pittock, 2017, Griffith, Malpas, 2020, Irani, Stagg, 2013, Loane, Argyropoulos, 2019, Long and Day, 2018). Progressive decline in an appropriately treated patient should prompt evaluation for alternate etiologies, including infections in patients receiving immunomodulatory therapies, and common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Third, molecular biomarkers of common age-related neuropathology may be useful in the evaluation of complex patients. Amyloid PET imaging is currently FDA-approved for the diagnosis of AD. However, its diagnostic value is limited in older individuals due to the high prevalence of cerebral amyloidosis (Rabinovici et al. , 2019). By contrast, emergent FDA-approved tau PET tracers may serve as specific markers of AD-associated neurofibrillary (tau) pathology, with the ability to predict symptomatic onset, clinical presentation (Day, Gordon, 2017, Ossenkoppele et al. , 2016) severity (Brier et al. , 2016, Jack et al. , 2018b, Wang et al. , 2016), and neuropathology (Fleisher et al. , 2020) in research cohorts. Biofluid biomarkers of AD, including established CSF markers (Fagan, Roe, 2007) and emergent plasma measures of AD (Schindler et al. , 2019), may also aid in diagnoses. However, caution is advised when interpreting biofluid biomarker findings in patients with active or past inflammation, recognizing that inflammation may influence the concentration of target analytes in CSF or blood, altering assay performance and interpretation. Dedicated biomarker studies in patients with AE are required to clarify this issue.

This report adds to the limited neuropathological data available from patients with LGI1 antibody encephalitis that implicate immunoglobulin and complement deposition as mediators of neuronal death and dysfunction in symptomatic patients (Bien et al. , 2012). While the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in this case does not exclude the possibility that inflammation contributed to recrudescence of symptoms, our findings suggest that patients may recover without histopathological sequelae of AE. As the pathological processes that underpin AD generally begin decades before the emergence of first symptoms (Jack et al. , 2018a), it is likely that early AD neuropathologic changes were present at the time of AE onset. These changes may have been accelerated by active inflammation, or alternatively, the symptomatic onset and rate of progression of AD may have been advanced by AE-associated damage.

Taken together, these findings suggest that symptoms of common age-related neurodegenerative illnesses may emerge following AE, complicating clinical assessment and management. Molecular biomarkers of neuropathology may aid in the evaluation of patients with resurgent symptoms and signs of AE. Future studies integrating molecular biomarkers and neuropathological analyses are needed to determine the relationship between AE, neurodegenerative disease and phenotypic expression.

Figure 1: Neuroimaging findings.

T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging at the time of PET imaging (A) demonstrated mild global atrophy, with mild periventricular changes noted on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences (B) consistent with small vessel disease. [18F]Florbetapir (amyloid) PET imaging (C) demonstrated symmetric cortical and subcortical tracer retention throughout frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, consistent with moderate / frequent neuritic plaques (note diffusely increased signal in cortical and subcortical areas, relative to the cerebellar cortex). [18F]Flortaucipir (tau) PET imaging (D) confirmed increased tracer retention in temporal (L&gt;R), cingulate and posterior parietal / occipital areas, in a pattern typically reported in Alzheimer disease (Mishra et al. , 2017). [18F]Flortaucipir uptake is reported in terms of standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), referenced to cerebellar cortex.

Figure 2: Neuropathology findings.

Column I. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained sections show minimal neuronal loss and gliosis in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG; panel A), superior temporal gyrus (STG; panel D), peristriate cortex (panel J), and dentate fascia of Ammon’s horn (panel G, arrows). Neuronal loss is mild in CA1 (panel G, arrowheads), without evidence of inflammation or other findings suggestive of autoimmune encephalitis. Column II. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for beta-amyloid peptide 1–42 (Aβ1–42 monoclonal antibody H31L21) reveals diffuse amyloid plaques (arrows) and cored amyloid plaques (arrowheads) in the MFG (panel B), STG (panel E), and peristriate cortex (panel K), and only diffuse plaques in the striatum (panel H). Column III. IHC for phosphorylated tau (P-tau antibody AT8) reveals neurofibrillary tangles (arrows), neuritic plaques (arrowheads), and neuropil threads in variable numbers within the MFG (panel C), STG (panel F), fusiform and parahippocampal gyri (panel I) and peristriate cortex (panel L). Scale bar (panel A) is equivalent to approximately 200 microns (panels A-D), 500 microns (panels F, J, K, L), 1 mm (panels G, H), or 2.3 mm (panel I).
