Objective:

The Uniform Data Set 3.0 neuropsychological battery (UDS3NB) is well developed for research with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and may serve as a common set of measures of cognitive decline across neurodegenerative diseases. However, the battery has not been formally assessed in persons with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The current research provides initial information on the convergent and ecological validity of the UDS3NB in individuals with PD.

Methods:

Participants included 75 individuals diagnosed with PD from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders. Clinical dementia ratings, administered independently from the cognitive measures, identified individuals as having normal cognition (n=38), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI; n=25) and dementia (n=12). UDS3NB measures were compared between these groups, and correlations between UDS3NB measures, gold standard neuropsychological measures, and informant rated activities of daily living ability (ADL) were evaluated.

Results:

At the group-level, UDS3NB scores followed the expected pattern with higher scores in participants with PD but no cognitive diagnosis and lower in those with dementia; scores in the MCI group were between these extremes. Convergent validity was suggested by moderate correlations between UDS specific measures (i.e. Craft story) and measures such as the RAVLT. Ecological validity was suggested by statistically significant correlations between UDS3NB performance and caregiver ratings of ADLs, with speed and executive functioning measures (Trailmaking A; r=−.51, p&lt;.01; Trailmaking B; r=−.51, p&lt;.01) most strongly related to reported daily functioning.

Conclusions:

Findings provide initial support for the convergent and ecological validity of the UDS3NB in individuals with PD. Implications and future directions for this battery are discussed.


pmcIntroduction

As clinical researchers in Parkinson’s disease (PD) continue to develop optimum cognitive measurement methods (Goldman et al., 2015), it is important to consider that cognitive decline in PD is frequently driven by multiple pathological processes (Adler &amp; Beach, 2016; Adler et al., 2010; Sabbagh et al., 2009), as is the case in many patients diagnosed clinically with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (Beach &amp; Malek-Ahmadi, 2021; Dugger et al., 2015; Jellinger, 2020; Toledo et al., 2013). Thus, utilizing clinical cognitive measures that can serve as a common language of cognition (Gershon et al., 2013) across studies in other disorders and clinical cohorts may prove beneficial at helping PD researchers relate their findings to the broader neurodegenerative literature as it evolves.

One potential battery that could meet the needs of the broad spectrum of neurodegenerative clinical researchers is the National Institute of Aging Alzheimer Disease Centers Uniform Data Set 3 Neuropsychological Battery (UDS3NB; S. Weintraub et al., 2018). The UDS3NB is relatively brief (approximately 20-30 minutes in length) but taps the domains of episodic memory, processing speed, language, attention/executive functioning, and constructional ability. The battery includes measures such as trailmaking and verbal fluency that are commonly recommended in the assessment of PD (Goldman et al., 2015; Marras, Tröster, Kulisevsky, &amp; Stebbins, 2014). Further, the UDS3NB has relatively well-developed normative data (Sachs et al., 2020; S. Weintraub et al., 2018) and is available through the NACC, which allows researchers to access the instruments and request data from studies utilizing the battery online (https://naccdata.org/). The battery is available in Spanish and other translations are in process, and has well explored psychometric properties including methods of evaluating multivariate base rates of low scores (Kiselica, Webber, &amp; Benge, 2020b), a validated method of estimating executive functioning (Staffaroni et al., 2021), discrepancy scores (Devora, Beevers, Kiselica, &amp; Benge, 2019), and change over time (Kiselica, Kaser, Webber, Small, &amp; Benge, 2020). The UDS3NB is composed entirely of non-proprietary neuropsychological tests, reducing costs for clinical research.

Despite such potential, to date there has been no published data specifically on the use of the UDS3NB in individuals with PD. To this end, in the current study we sought to a) explore the convergent validity of the memory and executive measures included within the UDS3NB with those more commonly utilized in PD-related cognitive research b) determine if measures from the UDSNB differ between individuals with PD and no cognitive disorder, PD-related MCI, and PD-related dementia and c) explore the relationship between UDS3NB measures and real world functioning (termed ecological validity; Chaytor &amp; Schmitter-Edgecombe, 2003) in those with PD.

Methods

Participants

Data was obtained from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND) database (https://www.brainandbodydonationregistration.org/). Detailed methodology of the AZSAND are described in a previous publication (Beach et al., 2015). All study procedures were reviewed by the local institutional review board for AZSAND, and written informed consent was obtained for all participants. For the current study, we reviewed records for 318 participants who had a clinical diagnosis of probable PD at baseline based on movement disorder specialist evaluation. Of these, 176 individuals had movement examination with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; (Goetz et al., 2008) and a neuropsychological examination within the same two year time frame, with 75 of those neuropsychological evaluations including the complete UDS3NB and forming the current sample.

Neuropsychological examination

Neuropsychologists and trained staff in AZSAND examined enrollees with a core neuropsychological battery in addition to the UDS3NB and clinical assessment of movement and cognitive-behavioral symptoms (Beach et al., 2015). The UDS3NB is described in detail elsewhere (Besser et al., 2018; S. Weintraub et al., 2018). Briefly, battery include immediate and delayed recall of a prose passage, a figure copy with subsequent delayed recall, number span forwards and backwards, animal and vegetable semantic fluency, phonemic fluency (letters F and L) and a confrontation naming test. Normative data for the UDS3NB measures from 3602 cognitively normal participants have been published previously, and multivariate linear regression formula developed to correct for the influence of age, education, and gender on performances; these formula were used to calculate demographically corrected z-scores for all UDS3NB measures (see S. Weintraub et al., 2018 for details).

In addition to the UDS3NB, additional cognitive and behavioral measures are administered as a part of the AZSAND protocol, including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Rey, 1958), the Stroop color word test (Golden, 2002), and the judgment of line orientation test (JLO; Benton, Sivan, Hamsher, Varney, &amp; Spreen, 1994), all of which are recommended measures for the assessment of PD related cognitive decline (Marras et al., 2014). To account for the impact of age, gender, and education, scores for these measures were also adjusted according to published normative data (Ivnik, Malec, Smith, Tangalos, &amp; Petersen, 1996; Norman et al., 2011; Stricker et al., 2021).

To avoid the possibility of criterion contamination by UDS3NB scores being used to define clinical status, independently administered global ratings from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; (Morris, 1993) interview were used to classify participants as cognitively normal (CDR=0.0), experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI; CDR=.5) or experiencing a dementia (CDR&gt;=1.0). Finally, collateral informants for each participant rated instrumental ADL performance on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ; Pfeffer, Kurosaki, Harrah, Chance, &amp; Filos, 1982).

Statistical Analysis

Differences between the diagnostic groups on the UDS3NB batteries were analyzed with Kruskall Wallis tests and Dunn post-hoc tests. The Kruskall Wallis test was chosen given the uneven sample sizes and concerns of normality of scores particularly in the dementia group. The Kruskal Wallis test rests on 4 assumptions: a dependent variable at a continuous or ordinal level (in this case UDS3NB scores), an independent variable with categorical, independent groups (diagnostic groups), independence of observations (no persons were in more than one diagnostic group) and that the distribution of scores in each group have the same variability. In cases such as the current one, where variability in scores was suspected to differ based on group membership, the Kruskall-Wallis test is more appropriately interpreted as a test for differences in the distributions of scores in the groups (Laerd, 2015). When Kruskal-Wallis results were statistically significant, pairwise comparisons were performed using Dunn’s procedure with further Bonferroni correction. Effect sizes (ε2) were calculated according to procedures outlined in (Tomczak &amp; Tomczak, 2014) with labeling of effect sizes according to common standards (Cohen, 2013).

For evaluating convergent and ecological validity, Pearson correlations between demographically corrected z scores on the UDS3NB for the PD group, as a whole, and other neuropsychological measures and the informant related ADL were conducted. False discovery rate analyses were used given the multiple statistical analyses utilized in this study (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995).

Results

Demographic and descriptive information for the sample is found in Table 1. Overall, participants were predominantly Caucasian, male, and had a college education. Based on CDR ratings, 38 were rated as having clinically normal cognition, 25 with mild cognitive impairment, and 12 with dementia.

Performance on the UDS3NB by Diagnostic Group

Demographically corrected z score performance for the UDS3NB measures are presented in Table 2. Statistically significant differences between diagnostic groups were found for all UDS3NB measures except for naming. Effect size estimates (ε2 ) were generally in the medium to large size range, with largest effect sizes observed for animal fluency and trailmaking A.

Those with PD and no obvious clinical cognitive impairment (CDR=0.0) scored around .5-to-one standard deviation below normative expectations on measures of phonemic fluency and rapid graphomotor search and sequencing (TMTA) suggestive of some mild psychometric weaknesses on measures that tap speed of processing and aspects of executive functioning, not unexpected in those with PD.Those with MCI occupied the expected transitional range of scores between participants with PD and normal cognition and those with and dementia on measures semantic fluency, trailmaking, and story recall. Participants with dementia demonstrated weaker scores on all cognitive measures relative to those with PD MCI and PD normal cognition save for naming. For naming, overall each of the groups had clinically unimpaired scores on average (Z scores &gt;−.5 z), with no statistically significant differences in distribution of scores between groups.

Convergent and Ecological Validity of the UDS3NB

Correlations between UDS3NB tasks and other neuropsychological measures are presented in Table 3. Statistically significant correlations (adjusting for FDR analysis) between UDS3NB memory tests and RAVLT were moderate and in the expected direction with verbal encoding and recall of the UDS3NB story. Furthermore, executive functioning as indexed by the Stroop Color/Word trial demonstrated moderate correlations in the expected direction with most measures, particularly trailmaking and verbal fluency measures. Visual perceptual ability as assessed by the JLO correlated with figure copy, but also attention and executive measures. It should be noted that there was a statistically significant degree of correlation amongst most of the UDS3NB measures and the RAVLT, Stroop, and JLO tasks, suggesting a degree of common shared variance across measures.

In terms of ecological validity, the relationship between the ability to complete daily activities scores and UDS3NB measures was generally moderate in strength and statically significant after accounting for multiple comparisons with the FDR analysis. Speeded processing and set shifting on trailmaking tests A&amp;B were the strongest correlates of informant-rated ADL performance. The only measures that did not directly correlate with reported day-to-day difficulties were naming and delayed recall of the story.

Conclusions

The current study provides initial support for the validity of utilizing the UDS3NB in individuals with PD and PD-associated cognitive impairment. First, the measures performed as expected given prior studies on dementia and MCI in PD. For example, even in the cognitively normal PD group, subtle weaknesses (around .5 to 1 standard deviation below demographically expected performance) were observed on measures sensitive to speed of processing and aspects of executive functioning, primarily the trailmaking test and phonemic fluency. This is consistent with prior reports that subtle dysexecutive and decrements in cognitive processing speed can be observed even in otherwise cognitively normal individuals impacted by PD (D. Weintraub, Tröster, Marras, &amp; Stebbins, 2018). The MCI group showed the expected pattern of intermediate performance between those with normal cognition and dementia, with more impairment in immediate and delayed story recall and speeded visual search and sequencing. This implies the battery can capture both memory and attention/executive type impairments commonly documented in PD-MCI (Litvan et al., 2011). Finally, the dementia group demonstrated impaired performance relative to those with MCI and normal cognition on all measures except naming, consistent with the expected multi-domain pattern of impairments in those with PD-related dementia (Emre et al., 2007). Overall, the current findings suggest that UDS3NB can capture the spectrum of cognitive disturbances in persons with PD ranging from subtle/early cognitive weaknesses to the more diffuse and severe deficits that may accompany dementia.

In addition, the UDS3NB measures correlated in the expected direction with more commonly used measures that capture PD related cognitive decline (Marras et al., 2014), suggesting convergent validity with established measures. With that being said, a few clinical points are worth considering. First, current recommendations for PD-related MCI diagnosis suggest using a multiple trial story memory measure (Litvan et al., 2011) to increase reliability, while the UDS story memory measure includes only a single learning trial. Despite this, correlations between immediate and delayed story recall and immediate and delayed list learning recall were moderate. Overall, utilizing the UDS3NB with a list learning measure is recommended, as the two measures provide complementary but distinct information about learning and recall in PD (Zahodne et al., 2011). It is also important to note that cognitive measures tend to intercorrelate as well. For example, immediate recall of the story memory measure was correlated to a statistically significant degree not just with the RAVLT memory measure but also the Stroop Color Word Trial. In a similar vein trailmaking performance correlated with RAVLT, Stroop, and JLO performance. These findings support the notion that higher order general cognition factors should be considered when interpreting tests from the UDS3NB as markers of underlying cognitive constructs (Kiselica, Webber, &amp; Benge, 2020a)

A major consideration for PD-related cognitive endpoints in clinical research are linking outcome measures to improvements in daily functioning (Eberling et al., 2014), which are important patient centered outcomes for those impacted by PD (Raein, Ortiz-Hernández, &amp; Benge, 2019). Thus ecologically valid measures that capture cognitive ADL difficulties are particularly important (Benge &amp; Balsis, 2016). While the ecological validity of the UDS3NB has been demonstrated in prior studies with other neurodegenerative diseases (Benge, Artz, &amp; Kiselica, 2020), the current study showed a similar pattern of results in a PD sample. Of the UDS3NB measures, the commonly utilized trailmaking test in particular was strongly correlated with caregiver reported instrumental activities of daily living, again supporting the importance of measures of processing speed, attention, and executive functioning in understanding ADL ability in those impacted by PD.

Limitations of the current study include the limited diversity of the sample with a generally white and well-educated study sample. Future studies in samples of individuals with PD of more diverse backgrounds are needed. The current study also had only a small sample of individuals with PD related dementia (n=12); future studies should explore the utility of these measures across the spectrum of PD related dementia in larger samples to ensure both feasibility of the measures and ensure the validity of these measures in this group.

It is important to note that cognition in persons with PD can be impacted by a host of factors not directly explored in this study, including pharmacological, mood, and other non-motor symptoms (Goldman et al., 2018). Thus, future studies may want to evaluate the relative sensitivity of UDS3NB measures to these variables as well. Given that motor as well as cognitive dysfunction can drive ADL performance in those with PD (Brennan et al., 2016), future studies may want to parse out the relative contributions of particularly upper extremity motor performance on the speeded graphomotor measures in this battery. Further validation of the battery in conjunction with more detailed executive and visuospatial tasks that do not have as many speed and graphomotor demands is also warranted. For example, the UDS3NB provides allows for the opportunity for evaluation of derived scores such as Trailmaking B/Trailmaking A ratio scores (Devora et al., 2019) which may better be able to elucidate the impact of cognitive and motor speed versus cognitive shifting on daily functioning in PD. The diagnostic accuracy of the UDS3NB measures relative to other instruments could also be a consideration for future studies.

Despite these limitations and opportunities for further study, our current study suggests that the UDS3NB appears to be a promising core battery of neuropsychological measures that could serve as a common language of cognitive disorders across neurodegenerative disease states including PD. Available as royalty free, with ongoing projects to translate the measures in many languages, and an evolving set of interpretative tools available, the UDS3NB appears to be a promising core battery for PD-related clinical research.
