Diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is also called type 3 diabetes with insulin reduction and insulin resistance in AD patient brains. However, the molecular mechanism coupling diabetes to AD onset remains incompletely understood. Here we show that inflammation, associated with obesity and diabetes elicited by high-fat diet (HFD), activates neuronal C/EBPβ/AEP signaling that drives AD pathologies and cognitive disorders. HFD stimulates diabetes and insulin resistance in neuronal Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic (Tg) mice, accompanied with prominent mouse Aβ accumulation and hyperphosphorylated Tau aggregation in the brain, triggering cognitive deficits. These effects are profoundly diminished when AEP is deleted from C/EBPβ Tg mice. Chronic treatment with inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) facilitates AD pathologies and cognitive disorders in C/EBPβ Tg but not in wild-type mice, and these deleterious effects were substantially alleviated in C/EBPβ Tg/AEP −/− mice. Remarkably, the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin strongly attenuates HFD-induced diabetes and AD pathologies in neuronal C/EBPβ Tg mice. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that inflammation-activated neuronal C/EBPβ/AEP signaling couples diabetes to AD.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, with dementia as the most prominent clinical symptom. The key neuropathological features include extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation deposited into senile plaques and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated and truncated Tau aggregated into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), associated with neuroinflammation and extensive neuronal loss. Chronic inflammation has been proposed to play a critical role in AD onset [1, 2].

Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), which is manifested with hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and periphery inflammation, increases the risk of AD [3]. The molecular mechanism accounting for this effect is not fully understood, though accelerated accumulation of misfolded Aβ and hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) proteins in the pancreases in T2DM and brain insulin resistance have been proposed [4, 5]. On the other hand, memory loss and impaired executive function also accompany with T2DM [6, 7], especially in older adults [8]. Even in the absence of T2DM, insulin resistance is implicated in accelerated age-related cognitive decline [9, 10]. T2DM patients display increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, or AD, and AD patients show progressive brain insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. Hence, AD is also called Type 3 diabetes [11, 12]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that intranasal insulin improves both memory performance and metabolic integrity of the brain in patients suffering from AD or MCI [13]. Therefore, alterations in the brain insulin metabolism have been suggested as one pathophysiological factor underlying this neurodegenerative disorder [10, 14, 15]. Accumulating evidence supports the idea that reduced glucose utilization and deficient energy metabolism occur early in the course of AD progression, suggesting a role for impaired insulin signaling in the pathogenesis of AD. The growth factor levels are markedly decreased in the central nervous system (CNS) neurons, leading to abnormal insulin and IGF-I signaling in AD brains [11, 16]. The reduced expression of insulin, IGF-I, and their receptors suggests that AD may represent a neuro-endocrine disorder that resembles (yet remains distinct from) diabetes mellitus [12].

C/EBPβ belongs to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) transcription factors [17]. C/EBPβ is transcriptionally activated by inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α and bacterial LPS [18]. When the transactivation domain of C/EBPβ is phosphorylated by inflammatory stimuli, C/EBPβ gene transcription increases [19]. On the other hand, C/EBPβ feeds back and elevates expression of certain pro-inflammatory genes [20]. Furthermore, C/EBPβ is involved in various metabolic syndromes. For instance, C/EBPβ mediates adipose tissue differentiation, glucose and insulin metabolism, triacylglycerol metabolism, hepatic steatosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammation and etc [21]. C/EBPβ is increased in β cell lines exposed to high glucose concentrations as well as in pancreatic islets of diabetic animals [22], and it inhibits insulin mRNA transcription in β cell lines [23]. C/EBPβ deletion results in downregulation of hepatic lipogenic genes and increased expression of β-oxidation genes in brown adipose tissue (BAT).

Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP, also called legumain, gene name: LGMN) is an endo-lysosomal protease that is activated under acidosis. We have reported that AEP acts as δ-secretase, which cleaves both APP and Tau at N585 and N368 residues, respectively, and enhances Aβ production and NFT formation, resulting in cognitive dysfunctions [24, 25]. Blockade of AEP with a small molecular inhibitor diminishes senile plaques and NFT pathologies in AD mouse models, rescuing cognitive disorders [26]. In addition, C/EBPβ plays a pivotal role in regulating AEP expression in the CNS neurons in an age-dependent manner. Deletion of C/EBPβ alleviates AD pathologies by abating AEP expression [27]. Since C/EBPβ is implicated in mediating insulin and IR expression, C/EBPβ knockout mice are resistant to HFD-induced obesity [28]. Mounting evidence supports the idea that inflammation plays a critical role in linking diabetes and AD pathology [16, 29, 30]. Thus, we hypothesize that neuronal C/EBPβ may modulate insulin signaling in the brain and periphery system, coupling diabetes to AD. In the current study, we investigated if HFD-elicited inflammation associated with diabetes activates neuronal C/EBPβ/AEP signaling and induces AD pathologies in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice. In addition, we interrogated whether AEP depletion might alleviate diabetes and AD onset.

RESULTS

High-fat diet (HFD) induces diabetes in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice

To explore whether neuronal C/EBPβ escalation contributes to diabetes and AD pathology, we developed a neuronal specific Thy1 promoter-mediated human C/EBPβ transgenic mice (Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg). The single or double C/EBPβ Tg mice were viable and fertile. The mice transgenes were validated by genomic DNA genotyping (Supplementary Fig. 1A–C). The mouse Thy1 expression cassette drives transgene expression predominantly to the CNS. We used “WT” to designate the non-transgenic littermates of Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice, “C/EBPβ Tg” to designate hemizygous transgenic mice carrying a single copy of the human CEBPβ gene, and “C/EBPβ Tg/Tg” for homozygous transgenic mice carrying two copies of the gene. The mouse and human C/EBPβ genes were quantified by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 1D,E). To induce T2DM in these mice, we employed the high-fat diet (HFD) treatment for 12 consecutive weeks. Immunofluorescent (IF) co-staining revealed that C/EBPβ levels were elevated and phosphorylated signals (p-C/EBPβ), a biomarker for its activation, was also enhanced in WT mice by HFD as compared to chow diet. Both were further augmented in Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice (Supplementary Fig. 2A,B). Since Tg/Tg mice were difficult to breed and obtain sufficient numbers, we focused on single Tg mice for the whole study. Immunoblotting (IB) showed that C/EBPβ Tg mice but not WT littermates displayed insulin signaling reduction in the brain in an age-dependent manner even under chow diet. Notably, p-IR/p-IRS/p-Akt and p-GSK3β were significantly reduced in the brains of 16 months old C/EBPβ Tg mice; by contrast, the insulin signaling in 3-and 9-month-old C/EBPβ Tg mice remained unchanged and were comparable to their WT controls (Supplementary Fig. 2C), indicating that neuronal C/EBPβ escalation triggers insulin resistance in the brain during aging. Interestingly, both fasted and fed blood insulin levels were significantly elevated in C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to their WT littermates at 3 and 16 months of age, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2D,E), indicating that C/EBPβ Tg mice are insulin resistant at both ages as compared to WT littermates. Notably, the brain insulin levels in the 16-month-old groups of WT and C/EBPβ Tg mice were significantly lower than those in 3-month-old groups (Supplementary Fig. 2F), suggesting that insulin is decreased in the brain during aging in both strains of mice.

Since C/EBPβ plays a crucial role in both diabetes and AD, and its pivotal downstream target AEP cleaves both APP and Tau in driving AD pathogenesis, we crossed AEP −/− mice with Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice to obtain Thy1-C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. Intriguingly, both C/EBPβ Tg mice and C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice body weights were slightly lighter than WT littermates. When fed with chow diet, C/EBPβ Tg and C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice exhibited significantly lower body weights at 8 weeks old compared with wild-type mice (17.29–0.27 versus 16.33–0.29 g, P &lt; 0.05, n = 8, Student t test). The difference was more prominent in mice fed with HFD. After HFD treatment for 12 weeks, the obesity was much more obvious in WT mice than C/EBPβ Tg or C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. Although C/EBPβ Tg mice also exhibited progressive body weight gain upon HFD treatment versus chow diet, they displayed substantially lighter body weight than WT littermates under both HFD and chow diet, respectively. It is worth noting that the food intake was similar between WT mice and Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice at both 3 and 16 months old of ages (Supplementary Fig. 2G). By contrast, C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice revealed no significant difference in body weight regardless of HFD or chow diet treatment (Fig. 1A). Insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that both WT and Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice displayed insulin intolerance after HFD treatment as compared to chow diet. In contrast, C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice still exhibited high insulin sensitivity under both conditions (Fig. 1B). Glucose tolerance test (GTT) indicated that C/EBPβ Tg mice demonstrated much stronger glucose intolerance under both HFD and chow diet than WT littermates. Again, C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice displayed the lowest glucose intolerance. HFD treatment elicited significantly higher glucose intolerance than chow diet among these groups (Fig. 1C). These effects were confirmed by area under curve analysis (Fig. 1D,E). In parallel, hyperinsulinemia was observed in fed and fasted WT mice after HFD feeding, suggesting insulin resistance. Strikingly, C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice, but not C/EBPβ Tg mice displayed higher insulin levels after HFD treatment than their chow diet cohort in both fed and fasted conditions (Fig. 1F,G). HFD feeding increased the circulating leptin concentrations in all tested mice with the highest leptin level found in the WT animals, followed by C/EBPβ/AEP −/− and C/EBPβ Tg mice (Fig. 1H). Again, insulin levels in the brains of HFD-fed mice were more abundant than their corresponding chow diet control, but WT mice displayed significantly higher insulin concentrations than C/EBPβ Tg and C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice after HFD feeding (Fig. 1I). Thiamine deficiency contributes to hyperglycemia and diabetes complications [31]. In alignment with these findings, C/EBPβ Tg mice demonstrated lower thiamine than WT controls under both chow diet and HFD, whereas thiamine diphosphate remained comparable between the two strains under both conditions (Fig. 1J). Together, these data support the concept that Thy1-C/EBPβ mice are more vulnerable for HFD-induced diabetes and insulin resistance.

High-fat diet (HFD) diminishes AMPK/ACC pathway and impairs insulin signaling in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice

Adipocyte dysfunction is one of the major factors that trigger insulin resistance. Therefore, we examined diet-induced adipogenesis in C/EBPβ Tg mice. H&amp;E staining showed that the adipocytes in white adipocyte tissue (WAT) of WT mice treated with HFD were bigger than those in chow diet-fed mice. However, the adipocytes in HFD-treated C/EBPβ Tg mice were much bigger than chow diet-treated group. By contrast, deletion of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice reduced the adipocyte size (Supplementary Fig. 3A, upper panels). Further, H&amp;E staining showed more lipid droplets in the livers of HFD-treated WT and C/EBPβ Tg mice fed with HFD than their chow diet control. In contrast, the lipid droplets were less abundant in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 3A, lower panels). These observations were validated by Oil Red O staining (Supplementary Fig. 3B,C). The concentrations of free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride (TG) in the blood were significantly higher in HFD-fed C/EBPβ Tg mice than those of their chow diet-fed control. Knockout of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice abolished these effects. Circulating cholesterol levels were highly increased in WT mice after HFD treatment. Though both FFA and TG were elevated in WT mice after HFD feeding compared to the chow diet group, they only displayed the trends but were not statistically significant (Supplementary Fig. 3D). Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα were all highly augmented in WT after HFD treatment, which was further elevated in C/EBPβ Tg mice. Notably, the cytokines levels in C/EBPβ Tg mice were significantly higher than WT mice even under chow diet. Again, eradication of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice greatly decreased these cytokine concentrations in the blood (Supplementary Fig. 3E). Hence, HFD strongly increases the lipid deposition, adipocyte size, and inflammation in Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice, and deletion of AEP markedly diminishes these effects.

AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a fuel-sensing kinase. Activation of AMPK reduces hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression and glucose production, increases fatty acid oxidation, and enhances glucose uptake [32]. IB revealed that both p-AMPK and p-ACC signals were demonstrable in the WAT in WT mice under chow diet, but they were clearly reduced in C/EBPβ Tg mice, though AMPK and ACC total levels in these tissues were comparable. Deletion of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice alleviated this suppression. Remarkably, HFD strongly suppressed both p-AMPK and p-ACC activities in WT mice and this antagonistic effect was even stronger in C/EBPβ Tg mice by HFD. Again, the effects were attenuated in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Fig. 2A). Similar effects are also observed in BAT, muscle and liver (Fig. 2B–D). Hence, AMPK/ACC signaling is decreased in the periphery tissues in C/EBPβ Tg mice and deletion of AEP alleviates this repressive effect in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− Tg mice. In addition, we monitored insulin signaling in insulin responsive tissues including muscle and liver. IB showed that p-IR was evidently reduced in C/EBPβ Tg mice muscles as compared to WT mice under chow diet. HFD markedly reduced p-IR activities in WT mice and this inhibitory effect was much more robust in C/EBPβ Tg mice. Knockout of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice significantly abrogated this effect. The total levels of IR in muscles from different strains of mice were almost similar, and the ratios of p-IR/IR were quantified. As expected, the downstream effectors p-IRS and p-Akt tightly oscillated with the upstream p-IR activities (Fig. 2E). We made the same observations in the liver tissue (Fig. 2F). Hence, both insulin signaling and p-AMPK/p-ACC pathway are impaired in Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice under the basal conditions, and HFD treatment further abolishes this metabolic signaling.

Knockout of AEP in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice alleviates HFD-induced neuro-inflammation and AD pathologies

To assess the impact of neuronal C/EBPβ or HFD on insulin signaling in the brain, we conducted IB with the brain tissues from WT and C/EBPβ Tg mice with or without 12 weeks of HFD treatment. Under chow condition, p-IR/p-IRS/p-Akt activities were significantly decreased in the brain from C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to WT mice. Under HFD, this pathway was also reduced in WT mice when compared to chow diet, and this signaling was further repressed in C/EBPβ Tg mice. However, deletion of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice significantly alleviated this inhibitory effect. A similar pattern of P-AMPK/p-ACC pathway was detected in the brain (Fig. 3A,B). Enzymatic assays revealed that AEP protease activities were increased in the brain of WT mice by HFD, which were further enhanced in C/EBPβ Tg mice from chow diet to HFD, and they were eradicated in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Fig. 3C). Quantification showed pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL6 but not TNFα displayed similar patterns, and both IL-1β and IL6 were significantly reduced in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice under both chow and HFD feeding conditions (Fig. 3D–F). To explore whether HFD provokes AD pathologies in these mice, we conducted IB and found that C/EBPβ and truncated (active) AEP were escalated in WT mice upon HFD treatment. These events were augmented in the brain of C/EBPβ Tg mice and further elevated by HFD stimulation, accompanied by increased fragmented APP N585 and Tau N368 truncates. Consequently, p-Tau AT8 levels were strongly increased in C/EBPβ Tg mice upon HFD treatment. Notably, both Tau5 and BACE1 total levels were enhanced in C/EBPβ Tg mice by HFD stimulation (Fig. 3G). IF co-staining validated that HFD provoked p-C/EBPβ and AEP escalation in the hippocampus of WT mice as compared to chow diet. These effects were escalated in C/EBPβ Tg mice, but alleviated in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4A). Consequently, APP was markedly cleaved by active AEP into APP N585 in the brains of C/EBPβ Tg mice, and knockout of AEP strongly diminished APP fragmentation in C/EBPβ/AEP−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Moreover, Tau N368 and AEP co-staining revealed that they were increased in C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to WT mice with HFD. By contrast, these signals were barely detectable in C/EBPβ/AEP−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 4C), supporting the notion that HFD stimulates both APP N585 and Tau N368 cleavage by active AEP via C/EBPβ/AEP signaling.

In alignment with these findings, Iba-1 and GFAP staining showed that microglia and astrogliosis were elevated in the hippocampus and cortex of WT mouse brain by HFD treatment versus chow diet. This pattern was greatly aggravated in C/EBPβ Tg mice with prominent Iba-1 and GFAP signals under HFD treatment, and deletion of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice selectively eliminated Iba-1 and GFAP activities (Fig. 3H, I, J; Supplementary Fig. 5A), suggesting that AEP plays a critical role in mediating HFD-triggered neuro-inflammation in C/EBPβ Tg mice. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of anti-Aβ with monoclonal antibody 4G8 and anti-p-Tau AT8 on the hippocampal and cortical sections demonstrated that both Aβ and Tau pathologies were peaked in C/EBPβ Tg mice under HFD treatment, which were significantly abolished in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. Silver staining also validated proteinaceous inclusions accumulated in the hippocampus and cortex of C/EBPβ Tg mice upon HFD treatment, which were reduced in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Fig. 3K; Supplementary Fig. 5B, C). These signals were quantified (Supplementary Fig. 5D). Quantification revealed that HFD significantly elevated Aβ40 levels in the brains of both WT and C/EBPβ Tg mice versus chow diet, and depletion of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice substantially decreased Aβ40 concentrations. On the other hand, HFD only significantly augmented Aβ42 concentrations in the brains of C/EBPβ Tg mice versus chow diet. We also observed escalated Aβ42 concentrations in WT and C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice after HFD, but this effect was not statistically significant (Fig. 3L,M). Therefore, HFD elicits insulin resistance and AD pathologies in the brains of C/EBPβ Tg mice, and AEP is indispensable for this effect.

Deletion of AEP from Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice ameliorates HFD-triggered synaptic degeneration and cognitive dysfunctions

To further examine the effect by HFD on AD pathology in both C/EBPβ Tg mice and C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice, we conducted IB with brain tissues and found that HFD highly elevated C/EBPβ versus chow diet in C/EBPβ Tg mice, and this effect was abrogated in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. Consequently, downstream target AEP was greatly escalated by HFD in the brain of C/EBPβ Tg mice, accompanied with elevated Tau N368 and APP N585 fragmentation. Consequently, p-Tau AT8 activities were increased. BACE1 total levels were enhanced in C/EBPβ Tg mice by HFD, and all these biochemical events were substantially blunted in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Fig. 4A,B). Golgi staining showed that C/EBPβ Tg mice exhibited reduced neurite processes and dendritic spines compared to WT mice under chow diet. Sholl analysis for the dendritic crossing and intersection number indicated that C/EBPβ Tg mice displayed the fewest intersection crossings with HFD fewer than chow diet, which were substantially decreased by HFD treatment. By contrast, deletion of AEP significantly rescued the reductions in dendritic branching and spines in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice under both feeding conditions (Fig. 4C). IB showed that HFD treatment elicited pronounced reductions in synaptic proteins in C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to chow diet, and deletion of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice restored the synaptic proteins, in alignment with dendritic spine augmentation in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. In contrast, the synaptic proteins remained constant in WT mice between chow diet and HFD conditions (Fig. 4D). Morris Water Maze (MWM) tests showed that C/EBPβ Tg mice displayed impaired memory versus WT mice under both feeding conditions. Moreover, HFD also strongly reduced the time spent in the platform quadrant by C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to WT mice. Since some of the C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice were unable to swim well, their cognitive functions could not be analyzed in the MWM assay (Fig. 4E). Fear conditioning tests showed that C/EBPβ Tg mice exhibited prominent cognitive defects versus WT mice under both feeding conditions, and HFD significantly impaired C/EBPβ Tg mice cognitive functions as compared to WT mice. Knockout of AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice restored the cognitive defects triggered by HFD (Fig. 4F). Therefore, HFD elicits cognitive dysfunction in Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice, and AEP is necessary for this action.

LPS triggers APP and Tau cleavage and neuro-inflammation in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice via activation of C/EBPβ/AEP signaling

HFD incurs both diabetes and AD pathology and stimulates learning and memory disorders in C/EBPβ Tg mice, and C/EBPβ/AEP pathway plays a vital role for these events. Since C/EBPβ and inflammation mutually regulate each other [33], we wondered if HFD-elicited chronic inflammation couples these two diseases and drives the pathogenesis via activating C/EBPβ/AEP signaling. To test this notion, we chronically treated these animals with LPS (lipopolysaccharide), an endotoxin secreted by bacteria, to induce inflammation. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that transgenic human C/EBPβ mRNA levels remained comparable under both PBS and LPS conditions, whereas mouse C/EBPβ mRNA concentrations were significantly elevated upon LPS stimulation in both WT and C/EBPβ Tg mice but not in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. The similar patterns applied to LGMN, APP, MAPT, BACE1 and IL-6 mRNAs as well (Supplementary Fig. 6A–G). These findings indicate that C/EBPβ might act as a transcription factor for APP, MAPT and BACE1, driving the expression of these crucial genes in AD pathogenesis, in addition to mediating reported LGMN and IL-6 genes. IB analysis indicated that LPS upregulated mouse C/EBPβ and increased its downstream targets AEP, APP, Tau and BACE1 expression levels. These effects were highly enhanced in C/EBPβ Tg mice, leading to cleaved (active) AEP, and APP N585 and Tau N368 fragmentation by active AEP, resulting in p-Tau AT8 activities elevation. These events were evidently diminished in C/EBPβ ± mice (Fig. 5A). AEP enzymatic activities in the brain lysates oscillated with active AEP levels shown in IB (Fig. 5B). To further assess the role of LPS in activating C/EBPβ and neuro-inflammation in the hippocampus, we conducted IF co-staining on the brain sections after chronic LPS treatment. Both C/EBPβ and p-C/EBPβ signals were elevated in the hippocampus of WT by LPS, accompanied with IL-6 upregulation. These effects were greatly augmented in the hippocampus of C/EBPβ Tg mice. As a control for staining specificity, we employed C/EBPβ ± mice. The LPS-elicited effects in these mice were greatly abrogated (Supplementary Fig. 6I,J), indicating anti-C/EBPβ immunofluorescent staining is specific and C/EBPβ indeed is responsible for IL6 escalation. Quantification of these fluorescent intensity signals is summarized in Supplementary Fig. 6J.

Quantitative assays of inflammatory cytokines by ELISA demonstrated that IL-1β, IL6 and TNFα were greatly augmented in the brains of C/EBPβ Tg mice by LPS as compared to WT or C/EBPβ ± mice (Fig. 5C). Moreover, IB analysis demonstrated that LPS-stimulated biochemical effects in C/EBPβ Tg mice were greatly diminished, when AEP was depleted (Fig. 5D). Quantification of IB is included in Supplementary Fig. 6H. IF co-staining revealed that LPS treatment robustly increased both Iba-1 and GFAP signals in WT mice as compared to vehicle PBS. These effects were further augmented in C/EBPβ Tg mice. In contrast, deletion of AEP greatly decreased Iba-1 positive microglia activation and GFAP-positive astrogliosis (Fig. 5E, F). Nissl staining revealed LPS-stimulated hippocampal volume reductions in C/EBPβ Tg mice accompanied by brain atrophy, with this effect being ameliorated in C/EBP ± and C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice. Consistent with our previous observations, hippocampal neurons were clearly reduced in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions of C/EBPβ Tg mice treated with LPS (Supplementary Fig. 6K). Hence, chronic LPS elicits C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation, neuro-inflammation, and APP and Tau fragmentation in the brains of C/EBPβ Tg mice, associated with the hippocampal atrophy.

LPS induces AD pathologies and cognitive deficits in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice

To investigate whether chronic LPS stimulation triggers AD pathologies in the brains of C/EBPβ Tg mice, we performed IHC staining with anti-Aβ (4G8) antibody on the brain sections and found that LPS stimulated extensive Aβ aggregates, which were absent in WT or C/EBPβ ± mice (Fig. 6A, B). Co-staining with both anti-Aβ and Thioflavin S (ThS) revealed that the cores of senile plaques were ThS positive, indicating that these aggregated Aβ inclusions might form fibrillary β-sheets. Human Aβ antibody staining yielded no signals, validating that these were mouse Aβ aggregates. However, LPS failed to stimulate Aβ accumulation in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Fig. 6C). To characterize Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations in the brain, we prepared the insoluble and soluble Aβ fractions with formic acid and DEA (diethylamine), respectively. Quantification indicated that Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in both fractions were significantly enhanced in C/EBPβ Tg mice by LPS, whereas they remained unchanged in WT, C/EBPβ ± or C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Fig. 6D). IHC staining with AT8 demonstrated that chronic LPS stimulation elicited Tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus in WT mice, which were markedly aggravated in C/EBPβ Tg mice. Knockout of either C/EBPβ or AEP alleviated these pathological effects (Fig. 6E, F). Notably, co-staining revealed that AT8 positive neurons were also ThS positive, suggesting NFT accumulation in these neurons in the hippocampus of C/EBPβ Tg mice, which was further confirmed by silver staining (Fig. 6G).

Sholl analysis showed that dendritic branching and process crossing were substantially diminished in C/EBPβ Tg mice upon LPS chronic treatment as compared to WT mice. Moreover, Golgi staining revealed that the dendritic spines were significantly reduced in C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to WT mice. Deletion of C/EBPβ or knockout AEP from C/EBPβ Tg mice alleviated these effects (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B). IB analysis demonstrated that synaptic proteins were clearly decreased in C/EBPβ Tg mice after chronic LPS treatment, which was alleviated in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 7C). Quantitative analysis revealed that LPS strongly increased inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β and IL-6 in WT mice, which were further enhanced by LPS in C/EBPβ Tg mice, and TNFα levels were also robustly elevated in these mice. As expected, this stimulatory effect was abrogated in C/EBPβ/AEP −/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 7D). MWM tests supported the idea that chronic LPS stimulation triggered learning and memory deficits in C/EBPβ Tg mice without impairing the motor functions, because these mice exhibited comparable swimming speeds (Supplementary Fig. 8A–C). Fear conditioning tests showed that LPS triggered dramatic cognitive deficits in C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to WT mice, but C/EBPβ/AEP −/− or C/EBPβ ± mice were resistant to LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 8D, E). Hence, these results support the notion that LPS treatment stimulates AD pathologies and cognitive dysfunctions in C/EBPβ Tg mice, with AEP being required for this effect.

NSAID aspirin abrogates HFD-induced inflammation, diabetes, and AD pathologies in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice

HFD or LPS-induced chronic inflammation triggers neuronal C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation, leading to AD pathogenesis and cognitive defects in Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice. To ascertain that chronic inflammation is indeed driving this effect, we pretreated WT or C/EBPβ Tg mice with HFD for 2 months, followed by non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) aspirin and HFD co-treatment for 1 month. At the end of the treatment, we examined the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum and the brains. We found that aspirin greatly diminished inflammation in these tissues from both WT and C/EBPβ Tg mice as compared to vehicle control, and also significantly blunted AEP enzymatic activities in both mice (Supplementary Fig. 9A). In alignment with neuroinflammation reduction, Iba-1 and GFAP co-staining revealed that HFD-triggered microglia activation and astrogliosis were markedly suppressed by aspirin (Supplementary Fig. 9B). IB analysis showed that aspirin also substantially reduced HFD-provoked C/EBPβ/AEP signaling. Consequently, AEP-truncated APP N585 and Tau N368 fragmentation was robustly antagonized, leading to decrease in AT8 activities (Supplementary Fig. 9C). IHC staining indicated that HFD-elicited mouse Aβ aggregates (4G8) and mouse Tau hyperphosphorylation (AT8) were attenuated by aspirin (Supplementary Fig. 10A,B; Supplementary Fig. 11A, B). IF co-staining showed that HFD-induced C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation and subsequent APP N585 and Tau N368 cleavage by active AEP were inhibited by aspirin (Supplementary Fig. 10C–E). On the other hand, insulin signaling pathways, including p-IR/p-IRS/p-Akt/p-GSK3β in the brain of C/EBPβ Tg mice, were repressed by HFD as compared to WT mice. Aspirin treatment significantly alleviated this inhibitory effect (Supplementary Fig. 9D), indicating that HFD-induced insulin resistance in C/EBPβ Tg mice in the brain is assuaged by aspirin. Sholl analysis and Golgi staining supported that the neurite crossing and the dendritic spine reduction in C/EBPβ Tg mice induced by HFD were restored by aspirin as compared to vehicle (Supplementary Fig. 10F). Accordingly, cognitive behavioral tests demonstrated that HFD-triggered learning and memory defects in C/EBPβ Tg mice were greatly rescued by the aspirin treatment (Supplementary Fig. 9E). Together, these data support that the NSAID aspirin blocks HFD-induced neuroinflammation in C/EBPβ Tg mice and attenuates insulin resistance and AD pathologies, restoring the cognitive functions.

DISCUSSION

Multiple lines of evidence highlight the importance of peripheral inflammation and its link to neuroinflammation, which leads to neurodegenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD) [34]. In the current study, we demonstrate that HFD treatment induces diabetes in Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice (Figs. 1–3), accompanied with demonstrable neuroinflammation that are manifested with extensive gliosis and microglia activation in the brain. Employing pro-inflammatory LPS and the anti-inflammatory drug aspirin, we found that diabetes-associated inflammation activates neuronal C/EBPβ, which subsequently upregulates APP and Tau expression levels that are cleaved by augmented AEP and BACE1 (Figs. 5 &amp; 6, Supplementary Fig. 9). Consequently, mouse Aβ and phosphorylated mouse Tau are accumulated and aggregated into proteinaceous inclusions that are associated with diminished dendritic spines with simplified dendritic arbor morphology, resulting in cognitive defects (Fig. 5 &amp; 6). Notably, deletion of AEP from Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice not only abolishes HFD-induced obesity and diabetes but also abrogates AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits. It remains unclear why C/EBPβ Tg/AEP −/− mice are abnormal in swimming, although other aspects of their locomotor function appear normal. Hence, we cannot use MWM tests to evaluate their cognitive performance (Fig. 4E, Supplementary Fig. 8). As expected, depletion of AEP markedly decreased HFD or LPS-triggered inflammation and C/EBPβ activation in the brains, underscoring that inflammation links diabetes to AD via activating neuronal C/EBPβ/AEP signaling. This observation is further enforced by the observation that aspirin restored insulin signaling and cognitive functions (Supplementary Fig. 9).

AMPK is the master sensor for energy status and is responsible for metabolic homeostasis [35]. One of the functions of AMPK is to switch off fatty acid synthesis via p-ACC [36]. In alignment with the obese phenotype in WT mice upon HFD treatment, p-AMPK/p-ACC signaling is reduced in WT mice. Notably, p-AMPK/p-ACC is further repressed in C/EBPβ Tg mice after HFD treatment. Interestingly, though HFD progressively increases the body weight of Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice, they are still substantially lighter than their WT counterparts, albeit their food intakes remain comparable (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 2G). It has been reported that a change of neuronal AMPK signaling enhances energy expenditure via the sympathetic nervous system [37]. Since a decrease in p-AMPK/p-ACC signaling was detected in the brain of Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice (Fig. 3A), this may elicit energy expenditure escalation and body weight reduction in CEBPβ Tg mice. However, it remains unknown how impaired AMPK/ACC pathway in the brain of Thy1-C/EBPβ Tg mice alters the insulin signaling in their peripheral tissues.

C/EBPβ knockout mice are resistant to HFD-induced obesity and exhibit decreased serum triacylglycerols and cholesterol concentrations [28]. In Fig. 2E,F, HFD treatment leads to insulin resistance in C/EBPβ Tg mice versus WT mice, which is supported by the GTT results (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, downregulation of IR/IRS/Akt signaling in the brain can only be found in 16-month-old CEBPβ Tg mice but not in younger mice (Supplementary Fig. 2C), suggesting that increased expression of C/EBPβ in neurons in the brain per se does not change the IR signaling, but that other factors/stresses during aging are needed to trigger the insulin resistance, thereby fitting with the observation that the impaired IR signaling is only detected in HFD-fed C/EBPβ Tg mice (Figs. 2 &amp; 3). Previous studies demonstrate that insulin regulates expression of C/EBPβ in various periphery tissues [38, 39]. C/EBPβ is also implicated in mediating IGF-1 and IR expression via binding to their promoters [23, 40, 41]. Transgenic overexpression of C/EBPβ in β cells of mice reduces β cell mass and lowers plasma insulin levels, resulting in the development of diabetes. Conversely, genetic ablation of C/EBPβ in the β cells of leptin receptor-deficient (Lepr −/−) mice, a mouse model of diabetes, results in an increase in β cell mass and ameliorates hyperglycemia [42]. Mounting evidence supports that the brain coordinates the aging process by acting as a primary sensor of physiological and environmental stressors through the action of conserved signaling pathways. Conceivably, neuronal C/EBPβ overexpression in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice mediates neural endocrine effects that may affect the periphery insulin signaling.

Together, our study supports that diabetes-associated chronic inflammation triggers C/EBPβ/AEP signaling activation, leading to AD pathogenesis in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice. Conceivably, the management of diabetes, assisted by anti-inflammatory aspirin treatment, may ameliorate AD onset and progression in the general population.

METHODS

Animals

Wild-type C57BL/6 J and C/EBPβ −/− were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (MMRRC stock # 000664 and #006873, respectively). Since some of the homozygous mutations are lethal on pure-strain backgrounds, C/EBPβ mice were maintained as heterozygotes on two separate strain backgrounds (C57BL/6 and 129 Sv). For the generation of Thy1-human C/EBPβ transgenic mouse, mouse genomic fragments containing homology arms were amplified from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone by using high fidelity Taq, and were sequentially assembled into a targeting vector together with recombination sites and selection markers. After confirming correctly targeted ES clones via Southern Blotting, we selected some clones for blastocyst microinjection, followed by founder production. Founders were confirmed as germline-transmitted via crossbreeding with wild-type. In the end, male and female F1 heterozygous mutant mice were confirmed as the final deliverables for this project. The genotypes of transgenic mice were validated by PCR (Supplementary Fig. 1). AEP-knockout mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and 129/Ola background were generated as reported (Shirahama-Noda, 2003, 278, 33194). The following animal groups were analyzed: WT, Thy1-C/EBPβ, C/EBPβ+/−, C/EBPβ/AEP−/−. Both female and male mice were used. 12-week-old mice were fed with chow or HFD (D12079B, Research Diets) for 12 weeks. After 1.5 months of behavioral tests, mice were sacrificed for pathological assessments. Animal care and handling were performed according to the NIH animal care guidelines. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Emory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Fig. 5 LPS triggers APP and Tau cleavage and neuro-inflammation in Thy1-C/EBPβ transgenic mice via activating C/EBPβ/AEP signaling.

A Western blot assays demonstrated LPS-induced activation of C/EBPβ and C/EBPβ-mediated upregulation of AEP, APP, Tau and BACE1 in the hippocampus compared to PBS treatment. LPS stimulation enhanced the levels of C/EBPβ downstream proteins, leading to cleavages of APP and Tau (N368) by activated AEP, and Tau hyperphosphorylation (AT8) in C/EBPβ transgenic mice.
