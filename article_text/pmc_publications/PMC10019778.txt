The primary neuropathological characteristics of the Parkinsonian brain are the loss of nigral dopamine neurons and the aggregation of alpha synuclein proteins. Efforts to develop potentially disease-modifying treatments have largely focused on correcting these aspects of the condition. In the last decade treatments targeting protein aggregation have entered the clinical pipeline. In this chapter we provide an overview of ongoing clinical trial programs for different therapies attempting to reduce protein aggregation pathology in Parkinson’s disease. We will also briefly consider various novel approaches being proposed–and being developed preclinically–to inhibit/reduce aggregated protein pathology in Parkinson’s.

Aggregation

Neurodegeneration

pmc1. INTRODUCTION

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and a neurological condition with an incidence that is growing faster than the rate of population growth (Dorsey et al., 2018; Dorsey and Bloem, 2018). Given that age is the primary factor associated with neurodegeneration, conditions like PD will inflict a greater burden on society as the elderly populations continue to grow in Western countries. Clinically, PD is characterized by a combination of motor features, including bradykinesia, rigidity, and a resting tremor, in addition to a collection of non-motor issues (such as gastrointestinal complaints, hyposmia, depression, cognitive decline, and sleep disturbance). The motor features of the condition are associated with dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Disease-modifying therapies that can halt the course of PD and improve quality of life are urgently needed.

The last 20 years have been marked by a tremendous increase in the number of clinical trials for PD. This trend has resulted both from progress where large genome analysis studies provided information on rare inherited forms of PD, which are possibly relevant to the common idiopathic form, as well as the emergence of animal models with a high degree of construct validity that reflect the slow progressive nature of PD. Both have provided much more understanding of the biology underlying the condition than was available 20 years ago. As a consequence, many recent clinical trials have targeted actual disease modification for PD - attempting to ‘slow, stop or reverse’ the progress of the condition.

The exact cause of the neurodegeneration observed in PD is unknown, but in many cases it is believed to be linked with the build-up of the protein alpha synuclein (α-syn). The strong focus on α-syn in the context of PD has stemmed from two primary sources. First, point mutations in the SNCA gene (which encodes α-syn) are (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997) associated with autosomal dominant PD, indicating that a gain-of-function toxicity may be involved in these particular cases of familial PD (Cookson et al., 2008). This genetic connection is further supported by the observation that individuals with an SNCA duplication and triplication develop neurological conditions with PD-like features, and those with triplications exhibit increased pathology compared to SNCA duplication cases (Fuchs et al., 2007). In addition, polymorphisms close to the SNCA have been associated with an altered risk of developing PD, and it has been suggested, although not proven, that this is due to small changes in the levels of α-syn (Hadjigeorgiou et al., 2006).

Second, α-syn is a major component of the intracellular inclusions–Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites–which are one of the classical pathological features of PD (Spillantini et al., 1998, 1997). The discovery of the gradual development of Lewy pathology in transplanted cells (Kordower et al., 2008; Li et al., 2008, 2016); however, has led to the proposal that a ‘prion-like’ propagation may influence the progression of PD (Steiner et al., 2018). Preclinical data have supported this idea, demonstrating that monomeric α-syn and certain α-syn assemblies can be passed from cell-to-cell, and can seed α-syn aggregation as well as triggering cell dysfunction and death in the recipient cell (Froula et al., 2019; Grassi et al., 2018; Volpicelli-Daley and Brundin, 2018). As a result of the attention on α-syn in PD, numerous clinical trials now seek to limit the aggregation and intracellular transfer of this protein (see Table 1). The path towards clinical trials for novel therapies is long and arduous for any approach aimed at slowing neurodegenerative disease, and targeting α-syn in PD has its own set of hurdles (Merchant et al., 2019). The different steps required to take an experimental therapeutic targeting α-syn in PD from the laboratory into the clinic first require extensive preclinical testing in cell and animal models of PD and (Merchant et al., 2019). Some features of the roadmap detailing how to translate an experimental α-syn therapy into proof-of-concept clinical trials is particularly challenging; for example, there is an absence of a validated biofluid biomarker or imaging modality that can be used to assess target engagement in the brain.

Despite the great interest in α-syn as a therapeutic target, it is notable that it has also been debated whether α-syn oligomerization and aggregation is really an upstream pathogenic event worthy of targeting or whether it is just an epiphenomenon or even a neuroprotective response to other pathogenic events. It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss in detail all the theoretical arguments that speak against targeting α-syn in PD, and they have been described elsewhere (Espay et al., 2019). One of the arguments is that anti-amyloid therapies have repeatedly failed in clinical trials in AD, and by analogy strategies to reduce α-syn aggregation in PD might be destined for failure. In this context, it is worth noting that none of the therapies designed to target α-syn pathology which are described in this review have actually gone through full clinical testing so presently it is fair to conclude that it is too early to dispel Lewy pathology as a valid therapeutic target. That said, Lewy bodies contain &gt;300 different proteins, of which 90 have been confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Wakabayashi et al., 2013). These additional proteins include SOD1 (Nishiyama et al., 1995; Trist et al., 2017) and TAU (Arima et al., 1999; Pollanen et al., 1992), as well as PD-linked gene products, such as PINK1 (Gandhi et al., 2006), LRRK2 (Zhu et al., 2006), and PARKIN (Schlossmacher et al., 2002). Thus, in addition to the α-syn targeted approaches, there are also clinical trials attempting to enhance autophagy and lysosomal dysfunction, and better therefore to support neurons which are stressed and over-burdened by protein deposits.

In our overview of the current state of clinical efforts to target protein aggregation in PD, we have divided the ongoing clinical trials into seven subgroups:

Immunotherapy

Small molecule inhibitors of aggregation

Lysosome-based enhancers

Autophagy inducers

LRRK2 inhibition

Iron Chelation

GLP-1 agonists

In the following sections, we describe and evaluate the clinical research being conducting in each of these areas. We also provide a brief overview over therapeutic strategies that target α-syn aggregation which are still at an experimental stage but which are approaching clinical trials.

IMMUNOTHERAPY

Determining exactly how to address α-syn as a target has proven to be a challenge. The finding that α-syn pathology appears in healthy cells transplanted into PD patients raised the possibility that cell-to-cell transfer of α‐syn could be involved in PD progression. This has led many to speculate about the utility of immunotherapy as a treatment approach for PD (Fig. 1). Antibodies designed to bind and aid in the removal of monomeric α-syn or different forms of α-syn assemblies have exhibited positive results in preclinical models of PD (Chen et al., 2013; Ghochikyan et al., 2014; Masliah et al., 2005; Sanchez-Guajardo et al., 2013; Ugen et al., 2015), and these findings have resulted to the initiation of clinical trials using passive and active immunization.

Immunotherapy - passive

Several pharmaceutical companies are exploring passive immunotherapy for PD. These therapies entail repeated intravenous infusion of antibodies that are intended to target α-syn present in the brain, and direct this α-syn for degradation, presumably via microglia. The first programme to enter clinical trials was conducted by Roche in partnership with the biotech company Prothena (https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2013-12-11p.htm). This study is focused on a monoclonal antibody called Prasinezumab (previously called PRX002/RG7935). Prasinezumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which is directed against the C‐terminus of α‐syn (Games et al., 2013). Testing in mouse models of α-syn pathology demonstrated that treatment reduced pathology and improved motor function (Games et al., 2014; Masliah et al., 2011).

The results of a Phase I clinical trial of Prasinezumab demonstrated that the treatment is safe and well tolerated, with a half‐life of 18.2 days, and a dose‐dependent lowering of “free” α‐syn (Schenk et al., 2017), although the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibody concentrations were only 0.3% of those recorded in plasma (Jankovic et al., 2018), which is in line with previous immunotherapy treatments targeting the brain (Freskgård and Urich, 2017).

In June 2017, Roche &amp; Prothena initiated the PASADENA study–a 2-year Phase II clinical trial comparing the efficacy of two doses of intravenous Prasinezumab to placebo in 300 people with early PD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03100149). This study involves a 1-year placebo-controlled double-blind phase, to be followed by another year in which all participants receive the antibody. During this second phase of the study, the participants will be blinded to the actual dose that they will be receiving. The primary outcome of this study will be the change in the MDS-UPDRS, over baseline scores, while the secondary outcomes include DaTscan changes, as well as a range of clinical, safety, and pharmacokinetic measures. This trial is set to report results in 2021/22.

A second major passive immunotherapy program for PD is being conducted by the pharmaceutical company Biogen. They licensed their monoclonal antibody–called BIIB054 (also known as NI-202)–from the biotech firm Neurimmune (http://www.neurimmune.com/newsartikel/20122010-biogen-idec-and-neurimmune-announce-agreement-on-three-neurodegenerative-disease-programs-.html). BIIB054 is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting the N‐terminus of α‐syn, which demonstrates a high affinity for aggregated forms of α-syn (800-fold higher affinity for fibrillar versus monomeric recombinant α-syn). It has also been reported to reduce levels of aggregated α-syn in three different mouse models of PD (Weihofen et al., 2019).

The clinical trial program for BIIB054–called the SPARK study–has been through Phase I testing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03716570 ; https://n.neurology.org/content/90/15_Supplement/S26.001) and, in December 2017, Biogen started a 2-year Phase II trial involving over 300 people with PD. It compares monthly infusions of 3 doses of BIIB054 to placebo in order to evaluate safety, pharmacodynamic effects of this antibody on preservation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of BIIB054. The trial, is conducted at 17 US sites, and is expected to report results in 2022 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03318523).

In addition to these two more advanced programs, there are a number of additional immunotherapy clinical programmes under development. Pharmaceutical company Lundbeck has a monoclonal called Lu AF82422 currently in Phase I clinical testing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03611569). Little is known about Lu AF82422, which was developed by Genmab (https://ir.genmab.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genmab-announces-antibody-development-collaboration-lundbeck). In addition, Astra Zeneca and Takeda also have a α-syn-targeting monoclonal antibody - MEDI1341. Preclinical data demonstrates that MEDI1341 significantly reduces α-syn accumulation and propagation by binding to both monomeric and aggregated forms of α-syn (Schofield et al., 2019), and Phase I clinical testing of this antibody has started in healthy volunteers (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03272165). BioArctic and AbbVie also have a monoclonal antibody - ABBV-0805 (also known as BAN0805) initiating clinical evaluation (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04127695). We can expect to see considerable data coming from the passive immunotherapy space for PD over the next few years.

Immunotherapy - active

Active vaccine-based immunotherapies are also currently being developed for PD. In this paradigm, the patient is immunized with an antigen present in aggregated α-syn and which is supposed to trigger an endogenous immune response and antibody production intended to reduce Lewy pathology. One example of this is the Austrian biotech firm, AFFiRiS (Schneeberger et al., 2016). The company has two vaccines (PD01A &amp; PD03A) which have been designed to target the aggregated forms of α-syn. Preclinical screening of peptides, and then testing in models of synucleinopathies, resulted in reduced accumulation of α-syn oligomers in neurons, less neurodegeneration, and improvements in motor deficits (Mandler et al., 2015, 2014). AFFiRiS has subsequently undertaken multiple Phase I clinical trials of these vaccines (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01568099 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02216188 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01885494), which has resulted in more than 90 PD and MSA patients having been injected with either PD01A or PD03A, with safety data and clinical observations now spanning out to more than 4 years. The company is continuing to follow up these treated individuals, while exploring new Phase II testing of these vaccines

A second active vaccine approach is being developed is a synthetic peptide-based ‘endobody’ called UB-312, which is owned by the biotech company United Neuroscience Ltd. UB-312 has been designed based on the company’s proprietary UBITh® platform (Wang et al., 2007). United Neuroscience also has an endobody for beta amyloid called UB-311 (C. Y. Wang et al., 2017), which is now in a clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02551809 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03531710). No preclinical data regarding UB-312 has yet been published, but the ongoing Phase I clinical trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04075318) should report in 2021.

SMALL MOLECULE ANTI-AGGREGATES

There are a growing number of biotech companies developing small molecules that target protein aggregation in PD. These are brain penetrant small molecules designed to directly inhibit α‐syn aggregation, and circumventing the problem with poor blood brain barrier penetrance of the antibodies involved in immunotherapies (Figure 1).

The San Diego-based company, Neuropore Therapies, and their pharma collaborator UCB are developing such small molecules which interfere with the interaction between α‐syn and membranes, resulting in reduced α‐syn oligomerization. Orally administered NPT200–11 has been shown to inhibit the development of α‐syn pathology in a transgenic mouse model of α‐syn pathology (Price et al., 2018). NPT200–11 is based on a previous compound (NPT100–18A) which lacked the pharmacokinetic properties suitable for clinical testing. The Phase I safety testing of NPT200‐11 in 55 healthy volunteers was completed in early 2016 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02606682 ; https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160322005337/en/Neuropore-Announces-Successful-Completion-Phase-Lead-Compound). The results of that study have not been published and it is not clear whether Neuropore plans to develop this compound further. The company has; however, initiated a Phase I clinical trial of a new misfolded protein targeting compound called NPT520–34 (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190508005227/en/Neuropore-Initiates-Phase-1-Clinical-Trial-Healthy ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03954600).

Another set of small, aggregation inhibiting molecules being developed are based on the naturally occurring compound, squalamine. Derived from dogfish sharks, this molecule has previously exhibited anticancer and antiviral properties (Márquez-Garbán et al., 2019; Zasloff et al., 2011). It has also recently been reported to affect α-syn aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo. Squalamine was found to displace α-syn from the surfaces of lipid vesicles, which blocks its aggregation process. When administered to models of α-syn aggregation in vivo, squalamine reduced levels of protein aggregation (Perni et al., 2017).

ENT-01 is a synthetic version of squalamine being developed by a biotech firm called Enterin. Unfortunately, neither squalamine nor ENT-01 access the CNS in sufficient quantities, so the company has instead focused its clinical development of ENT-01 on reducing the levels of aggregated α-syn in the enteric nerves surrounding the gastrointestinal system. This compound has been Phase I testing (the RASMET study; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03047629 ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590112519300015). The results of this open-label study suggest that the drug was well tolerated and resulted in an increase in bowel movements in 80% of the participants. Systemic absorption was only &lt;0.3%; however, suggesting that the effect of the drug is localised to the gastrointestinal system. A Phase II clinical trial of ENT-01 is currently being conducted (the KARMET study; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03781791). This study is a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 72 patients, randomised (3:1) to treatment or placebo. The primary endpoints are safety and measures of constipation.

Given the issues with CNS-penetrance of ENT-01, Enterin has also developed a derivative of squalamine called Trodusquemine, which has been tested in models of PD and found to access the brain (Perni et al., 2018). Notably, Enterin has recently initiated a Phase Ib clinical trial of ENT-01 for PD dementia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03938922), with the primary outcome being a cognitive score.

A third example of a small molecule approach is an experimental treatment called NPT 088. This drug is particularly interesting as it incorporates a general amyloid interaction motif, which means that it binds all amyloid proteins. The filamentous bacteriophage M13 has previously been reported to improve cognition and reduce β-amyloid plaque load in transgenic AD mouse models following chronic administration. Further characterisation of this anti-amyloid activity revealed that M13 has the ability to bind and remodel different types of misfolded protein aggregates, including β-amyloid, phosphorylated tau, and α-syn. Critically, this activity occurs without affecting the monomeric forms of these proteins (Krishnan et al., 2014). M13 achieves this via a two-domain fragment of the phage capsid protein g3p.

NPT 088 is a fusion protein that has been developed by Proclara Biosciences (formerly NeuroPhage Pharmaceuticals Inc), which was engineered to contain of the active fragment of g3p and human-IgG1-Fc. In preclinical testing, NPT 088 was found to significantly reduce β-amyloid plaques and improve cognitive performance of aged Tg2576 mice. In addition, NPT 088 also reduced phosphorylated-tau pathology, improved cognition, and reduced brain atrophy in rTg4510 mice (Levenson et al., 2016). Currently, a clinical trial is ongoing on NPT 088 in individuals with probable AD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03008161), and the company has indicated on their website this putative therapeutic would likely also be applicable to PD (http://www.proclarabio.com/our-programs).

Another small molecule that is being clinically tested in PD with the aim of reducing α‐syn aggregation is an FDA-approved osmotic diuretic agent, Mannitol. In vitro analyses indicated that low concentrations of mannitol inhibit the formation of fibrils, while higher concentrations significantly decrease oligomerisation. These results were supported by the reversal or prevention of pathological changes in vivo in drosophila and mouse models of PD (Shaltiel-Karyo et al., 2013). More recently, a conjugation of Mannitol and naphthoquinone-tryptophan was found to be more effective than the two parent molecules (Paul et al., 2019). A Phase II clinical trial is underway assessing the safety and tolerability of 36 weeks Mannitol treatment in a dose finding study of 60 individuals with PD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03823638), with the goal of subsequently conducting a larger assessment of efficacy.

A novel small protein aggregation inhibitor is called Anle138b. Treatment with this diphenyl–pyrazole-based compound not only inhibits α-syn protein aggregation, but also disassembles mature fibrils. Of particular interest for this compound is that delayed onset of the treatment in preclinical models of PD was also effective (Levin et al., 2014; Wagner et al., 2013; Wegrzynowicz et al., 2019). A German biotech firm, called MODAG, recently secured funding to begin clinical testing of Anle138b (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190627005315/en/MODAG-Launches-Stealth-Mode-Series-Financing-EUR). After Phase I safety/tolerability trials are completed, the company will be focussing their attention on Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA) - an α-synucleinopathy related to PD. Anle138b has beneficial effects in MSA models (Fellner et al., 2016; Heras-Garvin et al., 2019).

Another potential method of limiting α-syn levels is preventing translation of SNCA mRNA. Posiphen is a translational inhibitor of α-syn that targets the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) of SNCA mRNA which contains an Iron-Response Element (IRE). Posiphen increases the affinity of Iron Regulatory Protein-1 to the IRE of SNCA mRNA, which in turn prevents ribosomes from associating with the mRNA and thereby represses translation (Mikkilineni et al., 2012; Rogers et al., 2011). Interestingly, Posiphen also suppresses the translation of AD-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP). The mRNA of APP contains an IRE homologous to that of SNCA mRNA (Cahill et al., 2009; Shaw et al., 2001; VENTI et al., 2004).

The translational inhibition of APP by Posiphen has been well documented in models of AD (Lahiri et al., 2007; Lilja et al., 2013; Teich et al., 2018). In addition, in Phase I clinical trial of Posiphen - which is being developed by a biotech firm called Annovis (formerly QR Pharma) - the treatment was reported to be safe and well tolerated in 120 healthy volunteers. Following on from that result, Posiphen reduced the level of soluble APP, Aβ42 and tau in the CSF of four individuals with mild cognitively impaired (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01072812 ; (Maccecchini et al., 2012). Posiphen is now being tested a multi-dose, Phase I/II clinical study in 24 patients with early AD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02925650).

Preclinical research in models of PD have demonstrated that Posiphen also reduces levels of α-syn in rodent primary neurons and human cell lines (Mikkilineni et al., 2012; Rogers et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2013). Furthermore, a recent report suggests that 21 weeks of Posiphen treatment (10 mg/kg) reduces α-syn levels in the gut of hSNCA-A53T mice, while higher doses (50–65 mg/kg) also reduces levels in the CNS (Kuo et al., 2019). If the ongoing Posiphen clinical trial in early AD reveals beneficial effects on disease progression, it would be a relatively straightforward task to launch clinical trials of this experimental therapy in PD patients.

Whether inhibition of α-syn translation, aggregation or cell-to-cell transfer can halt the clinical progression of PD will be determined in the next few years. As these clinical immunotherapy and small molecule aggregate inhibitor trials are being conducted, additional studies are attempting to tackle the issue from a different angle by enhancing the degradation of protein aggregates.

LYSOSOMAL-BASED ENHANCERS

Lysosomal and autophagy dysfunction is an acknowledged feature of PD (Nguyen et al., 2019), and many of the genetic variants associated with the condition are in genes that have specific roles regulating these processes (Robak et al., 2017). It has long been recognised; however, that correcting dysfunction of the lysosomal autophagy system, or enhancing cellular waste disposal, might represent a therapeutic approach to apply to PD, and many efforts have been made towards identifying lysosomal/autophagy inducers (Figure 2). In this section, we focus on strategies to promote lysosomal function, and in the subsequent section we will discuss approaches aimed at inducing autophagy.

Ambroxol hydrochloride (Ambroxol) is an expectorant which is used in the treatment of respiratory diseases that are associated with mucus hypersecretion. In 2009, it was identified in a screening of US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs as a chaperone of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase - (Maegawa et al., 2009). Genetic variations in the GBA gene, which encodes GCase, are associated with Gaucher disease and PD (Sidransky et al., 2009). GBA-associated PD has a similar phenotype to idiopathic PD, although carriers generally have earlier onset of symptoms and higher risk of rapid decline and cognitive impairment (Beavan and Schapira, 2013).

Normally, GCase is synthesized, folded and translocated to the lysosome, but mutant forms of GCase fail to be correctly folded and become arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum. They are subsequently redirected to undergo proteasome degradation, resulting in reduced levels of GCase in the lysosomes (Maor et al., 2013). The decrease in GCase activity can lead to altered glycosphingolipid homeostasis and membrane composition, further resulting in lysosomal/endosomal dysfunction, compromised vesicular transport, and α-syn aggregation (Do et al., 2019; Hallett et al., 2018). Ambroxol has been shown to improve the translocation of mutant GCase to the lysosome, increasing GCase activity in cells carrying GBA mutations (Maor et al., 2016).

Ambroxol treatment has been shown to raise brain GCase levels in transgenic mouse models of PD (Migdalska-Richards et al., 2016), in fibroblasts from PD patients with GBA variants (McNeill et al., 2014), and in nonhuman primates (Migdalska-Richards et al., 2017). These and other findings have led to a clinical trial of Ambroxol in people with PD - called AiM-PD (or Ambroxol in Disease Modification in Parkinson Disease - https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02941822). There is also a second clinical trial of Ambroxol in PD dementia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02914366 ; (Silveira et al., 2019). This study is being conducted in Canada and involves 75 participants who are receiving daily administration of Ambroxol (or placebo) for 52 weeks. Both of these studies should be reporting their results within the next 12 months.

Another GCase enzyme-based approach for PD is a small molecule called LTI-291, which is being developed by Lysosomal Therapeutics. This drug is an activator of GCase and while very little information about this drug has been published, the company has conducted safety and imaging studies in Europe (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/6516 ; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7061). Lysosomal Therapeutics is now seeking to evaluate the compound in Phase II testing.

Additional GCase activators/chaperones are also being developed preclinically. For example, the NIH Chemical Genomics Centre has been screening and testing GCase activators (Aflaki et al., 2016, 2014; Mazzulli et al., 2016; Patnaik et al., 2012). One ambitious approach towards correcting GCase activity in GBA-associated PD is a gene therapy treatment currently being proposed by the biotech firm Prevail Therapeutics. Their primary candidate for clinical development is PR001, an AAV9 viral vector encoding the GBA gene. Gene therapy approaches for GBA-associated PD have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of the condition (Sardi et al., 2013, 2011), and it has been reported to rescue α-syn pathology in additional models of PD (Rocha et al., 2015). The US FDA accepted Prevail’s Investigational New Drug (IND) application for PR001, and the company has now initiated Phase I safety/tolerability testing of the treatment (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04127578). The proposed route of administration is a single injection into the intra cisterna magna which is intended to lead to widespread AAV9 viral vector-mediated expression of GCase in the CNS.

An alternative means of correcting altered glycosphingolipid homeostasis is substrate reduction therapy - inhibiting the production of glycolipid that accumulates in the absence of normal GCase activity. An example of this is a compound called Venglustat (also known as Ibiglustat &amp; GZ/SAR402671), which is being developed by Sanofi Genzyme for lysosomal dysfunction disorders, such as Fabry, Gaucher disease, and PD. It is an oral inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), which converts ceramide into glucosylceramide – one of the substrates of GCase that accumulates in GBA-associated PD.

GCS inhibitors have been shown to reduce α-syn pathological in models of PD (with and without GBA mutations (Kim et al., 2018; Zunke et al., 2018), and a novel brain-penetrant GCS inhibitor similar to Venglustat (called GZ667161) was reported to rescue mouse models of GBA-related synucleinopathy and α-syn overexpression (Sardi et al., 2017). These results led to the initiation of a large (240+ participant), two part Phase II clinical trial of Venglustat, which will assess safety/tolerability (part 1) and efficacy of the drug (part 2) in individuals with GBA-associated PD (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02906020).

AUTOPHAGY INDUCERS

Autophagy is a critical component of cellular waste disposal. Therapeutic manipulation of this process is seen by many molecular biology researchers as an important goal, the main aim of which is to improve how the body removes various proteins that implicated in human diseases (Boland et al., 2018). In PD, activation of autophagy has been found to have beneficial effects in many different models of the condition (Fowler and Moussa, 2018), and these results have led to numerous clinical trials evaluating a number of molecules for their ability to clear aggregated/accumulated proteins (Figure 2).

An example of this is the effort to repurpose the cancer treatment, Nilotinib, for PD. This is a brain-penetrant, non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson (c-Abl) inhibitor, which is used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia. c-Abl is a kinase which is present in most cells and has a variety of physiological functions, including autophagy, DNA repair, cell survival, regulation of cell growth and motility (Hantschel and Superti-Furga, 2004). In cells, c-Abl is normally present in an inactive form. It becomes activated by DNA damage and cellular stress. Preclinical data has indicated that Nilotinib is effective in inducing autophagy and clearing α-syn accumulation in models of PD (Hebron et al., 2013; Karuppagounder et al., 2015; Mahul-Mellier et al., 2014). A small unblinded pilot clinical study aimed at assessing safety tentatively suggested potential clinical benefits in individuals with advanced PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (Pagan et al., 2016). This small, open label study prompted the launch of two large, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trials of Nilotinib in PD: “PD Nilotinib” (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02954978 , which has already released some results (Pagan et al., 2019), and “Nilo PD” (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03205488). There are concerns regarding the use of this c-Abl inhibitor as it carries a black box warning due to the chance of QT interval prolongation in some patients. In addition, myelosuppression and sudden cardiac death have been reported in some patients taking Nilotinib (http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/118/21/2761). The doses currently being tested in PD; however, are lower than those used in oncology, and it is thought that this will hopefully reduce the risk of these undesirable side effects.

There are further efforts being made to develop additional CNS penetrant c-Abl inhibitors for use in PD. For example, the pharmaceutical company Sun/SPARC Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd has a c-Abl inhibitor (called K-0706) which has been evaluated in two Phase I studies of healthy individuals (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03316820), and is being clinically investigated for the treatment of chronic myelogenous Leukaemia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02629692). The company has also conducted a Phase I clinical study of K-0706 in healthy individuals to assess CSF penetrance (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03445338) and safety/tolerability in 32 participants with PD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02970019). A Phase II clinical evaluation of K-0706 in 504 people with PD has recently been commenced (the PROSEEK study; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03655236), and a Phase II study assessing K-0706 has also been initiated in Lewy body dementia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03996460). In addition to the aforementioned c-Abl inhibitors, there are further c-Abl being developed for testing in PD. Biotech firms, such as Neuraly (Lee et al., 2018) and Inhibikase Therapeutics, have specifically designed c-Abl inhibitors for use in CNS conditions, (https://www.inhibikase.com/news/press-releases/inhibikase-therapeutics-files-two-investigational-new-drug-applications-for-ikt-148009-a-disease-modifying-therapy-for-parkinsons-disease/).

Another autophagy-inducing drug that is being considered for repurposing for PD is the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier inhibitor, MSDC-0160. Originally developed for type II diabetes (Colca et al., 2013), this compound was recently reported to be an effective inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (Quansah et al., 2018). MSDC-0160 rescued human neurons in vitro and mice against the toxic effects of MPTP and the loss of one allele of the transcription factor Engrailed 1, as well as being protective in an α-syn c. elegans model (Ghosh et al., 2016). Given the good safety profile of MSDC‐0160 – and its ability to access the CNS – it could be a candidate for clinical evaluation in PD.

A robust approach to increasing autophagy is the use of TORC1 inhibition. The serine/threonine-specific protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a major regulator of cellular metabolism (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017). It acts via two protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy (Kim et al., 2011) and its inhibition is associated with increased autophagy activity (Noda, 2017). Given this particular property, researchers have focused on mTORC1 as a novel therapeutic target for PD (Lan et al., 2017) and significant efforts have been made to identify CNS penetrant mTORC1 specific inhibitors. One of these research programmes has been conducted by the biotech firm resTORbio which is developing a TORC1 inhibitor called RTB101. The drug has recently entered a Phase I clinical trial in New Zealand (https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=376782&amp;isReview=true). The company plans to evaluate RTB101 in both idiopathic and GBA-associated PD (with and without the mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus (Rapamycin) – which is believed to enhance the potency of RTB101).

One final autophagy enhancing treatment that is being evaluated in PD is the urea cycle disorder treatment, Sodium Phenylbutyrate. This prodrug of phenylacetate has been reported to have beneficial properties in multiple models of PD (Gardian et al., 2004; Inden et al., 2007; Ono et al., 2009; Roy et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2011) as well as other neurodegenerative conditions (Gardian et al., 2005; Minamiyama et al., 2004; Sturm et al., 2016; Ying et al., 2006). As a result of these findings, in 2014 the University of Colorado initiated a Phase I clinical trial of the FDA–approved small molecule glycerol phenylbutyrate, which is approved for the chronic management of urea cycle disorders. The open label, non-randomised trial involved 40 participants (20 with idiopathic PD and 20 age/sex matched controls), who would be taking 20 grams/day of phenylbutyrate in the liquid phenylbutyrate-triglyceride form, three times per day. Changes in plasma α-syn on day 1, 7, 14, and 21 days of the study were the primary end point https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02046434). Although the results of the study have not been published, conference presentations indicate the treatment is tolerable and it nearly doubled plasma α-syn. The researchers implied that sodium phenylbutyrate promoted α-syn clearance from the brain (https://www.alzforum.org/news/conference-coverage/potential-parkinsons-treatments-target-synuclein-cell-replacement).

LRRK2 INHIBITION

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2; also known as PARK8) is a multidomain protein, containing two enzymatic domains - a GTPase and a kinase – as well as several protein/protein interaction domains. It has been implicated in a number of cellular processes, and autosomal dominant mutations in the LRRK2 locus have been found to cause a familial form of PD with a penetrance estimated at 40–80%. In addition, polymorphisms close to the LRRK2 gene have also been identified as risk factors for the sporadic form of PD (International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2011). One of the most common PD risk variants - G2019S – results in an increase in LRRK2 kinase activity. This enhanced kinase activity has been shown to disrupt autophagy (Manzoni and Lewis, 2017; Ramonet et al., 2011). Inhibitors of LRRK2 have been developed and preclinical data indicates that they not only prevent neurodegeneration in models of PD (Lee et al., 2010), but also promote autophagy (Ho et al., 2018; Manzoni et al., 2013; Saez-Atienzar et al., 2014; Schapansky et al., 2018). On the back of this supportive data, clinical evaluation of LRRK2 inhibitors has commenced.

Denali has two LRRK2 inhibitors (DNL201 &amp; DNL151) in clinical testing. Phase Ia testing of DNL201 in healthy volunteers demonstrated more than 90% inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity at peak concentrations, and more than 50% inhibition at trough concentrations (http://investors.denalitherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/denali-therapeutics-announces-advancement-and-expansion-its#ir-pages). Phase Ia testing of DNL151 has also taken place (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7350). Denali is currently conducting a Phase Ib multicentre study of multiple oral doses of DNL201 in 30 PD patients with and without LRRK2 mutations in the USA (https://denalitherapeutics.com/investors/press-release/denali-therapeutics-announces-first-patient-dosed-in-phase-1b-study-of-dnl201-for-parkinsons-disease-1 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03710707), and a Phase 1b safety and tolerability study of DNL151 in 24 subjects with Parkinson’s in the Netherlands (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04056689).

A second approach for LRRK2 inhibition appears to be very close to clinical testing. The pharmaceutical company Biogen, and the antisense oligonucleotide firm Ionis Pharmaceutics, have recently registered a clinical trial to “evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BIIB094 in adults with PD” (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03976349). BIIB094 is a LRRK2 targeting antisense oligonucleotide approach. G2019S-LRRK2 expression has been reported to augment α-syn aggregation (Volpicelli-Daley et al., 2016), and preclinical data has demonstrated that LRRK2 antisense oligonucleotides ameliorate this pathology in vivo (Zhao et al., 2017).

Both the Denali and Biogen clinical trial programs are testing LRRK2 inhibition in both mutant LRRK2-associated PD and idiopathic PD, as there is preclinical data suggesting that LRRK2 inhibitors may be useful for some cases of idiopathic PD (Di Maio et al., 2018). However, concerns have been raised regarding LRRK2 inhibition approaches. Phenotypic analysis of LRRK2 knockout rodents has reported morphologic changes in lungs and kidneys (Baptista et al., 2013; Fuji et al., 2015), thus careful monitoring will be required during these trials.

IRON CHELATION

Various metals have been found to accumulate in certain tissues in PD, and this can stimulate protein aggregation in the brain. For example, iron is known to accelerate α-syn aggregation (Ostrerova-Golts et al., 2000), inducing oxidative stress and neuronal cell death (Deas et al., 2016). α-syn also acts on iron as a ferrireductase, reducing Fe3+ to Fe2+ and influencing iron homeostasis (Davies et al., 2011). Given these processes, iron chelation has been proposed as a therapeutic option for PD, and preclinical data has been supportive (Carboni et al., 2017; Das et al., 2017; Finkelstein et al., 2016). There are currently two large Phase II clinical trials of the iron chelator Deferiprone in PD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02728843 ; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02655315).

A second iron chelator that is about to enter clinical testing in synucleinopathies is a compound called PBT424, which is being developed by Alterity (formerly Prana) Therapeutics (in collaboration with Takeda). PBT434 has demonstrated impressive anti-protein aggregation properties, rescuing the motor performance of multiple mouse models, including α-syn transgenic models (Finkelstein et al., 2017). A Phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of PBT434 in healthy volunteers has recently been completed (https://alteritytherapeutics.com/investor-centre/news/2019/07/29/alterity-therapeutics-announces-successful-completion-of-phase-1-clinical-trial/ ; https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=374741), suggesting that the drug is safe and well tolerated. Alterity Therapeutics is now planning Phase II studies in the synucleinopathy MSA.

GLP-1 AGONISTS

The results of a Phase II clinical trial exploring the use of a Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist in PD generated a lot of excitement about this class of drugs (Athauda et al., 2017); https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01971242). GLP-1 receptor agonists are a frontline therapy for individuals with type 2 diabetes, stimulating glucose level–dependent insulin release, β islet cell proliferation, reduction of β islet cell apoptosis, and weight loss (Buse et al., 2004). GLP-1 receptors have also been found throughout the brain however, and evidence supports that Exenatide and other GLP-1 receptor agonists are beneficial in PD models (Chen et al., 2018; Harkavyi et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2015). Most of these studies have involved classical neurotoxin PD models, but recently, GLP-1 receptor agonists been also tested in the context of synucleinopathies and found to reduce the accumulation of α-syn (Yun et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). In a first open label Phase II study of exenatide in PD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01174810), exenatide was found to be well tolerated, and resulted in an average improvement on the MDS-UPDRS of 2.7 points, compared to a decline of 2.2 points in control patients at 12 months of treatment (Aviles-Olmos et al., 2013). While the initial study suffered from the shortcoming that there was no double blind placebo control, of particular interest was the finding that follow up assessments indicated beneficial effects persisted 12 months after cessation of exenatide (Aviles-Olmos et al., 2015).

Given the open-label nature of that first study, a randomised, double-blind Phase II trial was initiated. After 48 weeks on exenatide, the treated group was found to have a statistically significant reduction in the progression of their motor features - as determined by the MDS-UPDRS III – when compared to the placebo control group (Athauda et al., 2017); https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01971242). Following up on those results, a Phase III clinical trial has recently been initiated (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14552789). The study is recruiting 200 people with PD, who will be randomised and blindly treated with either exenatide or placebo for 2 years. The results are expected in 2024.

Since the encouraging Phase II trial results were published, another research group at the University of Florida has started an open label Phase I clinical trial of exenatide in PD (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03456687). Additional GLP-1 receptor agonists are also being clinically evaluated in PD. A Phase II study of Liraglutide in 60 participants with PD and insulin resistance is being conducted in California (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02953665), and a Phase II trial of Lixisenatide in 158 patients with early stage PD is being run across 21 hospitals in France (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03439943).

Based on the preclinical and clinical success of GLP-1 receptor agonists in both diabetes and PD, several biotech and pharmaceutical companies have begun developing drugs of this nature. Neuraly’s NLY01 is a pegylated long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist with an extended half-life and favourable pharmacodynamic profiles in non-human primates. NLY01 reduced the behavioural deficits and pathology in both the human A53T α-syn transgenic mouse model and the α-syn preformed fibril (PFF) models of PD (Yun et al., 2018). The results of this study suggest that NLY01 not only reduced levels of phosphorylated α-syn in the brain, but also provided neuroprotection via the prevention of microglia-mediated conversion of astrocytes to a neurotoxic A1 phenotype. In addition, Novo Nordisk’s longer acting GLP-1 receptor agonist Semaglutide is being tested in a large Phase II trial of 120 people with PD by the Oslo University Hospital – GIPD study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03659682). The Korean company, Peptron, are initiating a Phase II study of their GLP-1 receptor agonist, PT320 (which is a sustained-release version of exenatide). Phase I testing has indicated that PT320 is safe and well tolerated (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00964262).

PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENTS

In addition to these numerous ongoing clinical trial programs focused, some in part, on reducing α-syn aggregation in PD, there are various novel approaches being pre-clinically developed. In this final section of the chapter, we provide a brief overview of some of these efforts:

β2-adrenergic receptor agonists:

β2 adrenergic receptors (β2AR) are coupled to a stimulatory G protein of adenylyl cyclase. Agonists of this receptor increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. In the lung, cAMP decreases calcium concentrations within cells and activates protein kinase A. β2AR agonism causes bronchodilation, providing relief for individuals affected by asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). β2AR agonists have previously been shown to have neuroprotective properties (Xu et al., 2018), and the effects of both short-acting (salbutamol) and the longer-acting β2AR agonists (bambuterol, clenbuterol, formoterol, and salmeterol) on different models of PD. They found that low doses of all of the β2AR agonists were neuroprotective against LPS-induced neurotoxicity (Qian et al., 2011). A recent screen of 1126 FDA-approved compounds identified 35 compounds which lowered endogenous SNCA expression by more than 35%. When they validated these compounds, they found that of the top 4 compounds, three were β2AR agonists (Mittal et al., 2017). In addition, salbutamol was associated with reduced risk of developing PD, and the investigators found that Propranolol (a β2AR antagonist) was correlated with an increased risk of PD.

Efforts to replicate the association reported in this initial paper have been mixed. A population-based, case-control study of United States Medicare beneficiaries failed to find any association (Searles Nielsen et al., 2018), but two subsequent analyses of two large databases in Israel did report a reduced risk of PD with β2AR agonists use (Gronich et al., 2018; Koren et al., 2019). There have been three small clinical trials in PD (Alexander et al., 1994; Hishida et al., 1992; Uc et al., 2003) which have demonstrated improved response to levodopa, but the duration of these trials has not been long enough to evaluate any changes in disease progression.

Intrabodies

Given the brain penetrance issues associated with current immunotherapy approaches, efforts have been made to develop smaller intrabody or ‘nanobody’ alternatives. Intrabodies are small antibody fragments that target antigens intracellularly. At only 140–250 amino acids in length, intrabodies can be delivered as proteins or genes. These single chain antibody fragments have been evaluated in reducing the aggregation of α-syn (Emadi et al., 2004; Iljina et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2004).

Two particular intrabodies have been characterised in vitro: VH14 (as known as NAC14) and NbSyn87 (El-Turk et al., 2016; Lynch et al., 2008), and they have subsequently been tested in vivo (Chatterjee et al., 2018). Although these experimental therapeutics show some promise, there are significant challenges in taking them forward to the clinic, not least when it comes to delivery. Maintaining high levels of the intrabodies in the brain for prolonged periods of time has required the employment of gene therapy approaches and direct delivery.

PARP inhibition

Several publications suggest that poly(adenosine 5’-diphosphate-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is activated in both neurotoxin-induced models of PD (Mandir et al., 2002, 1999) and in brains of PD patients (Kam et al., 2018). PARP1 inhibition has also been found to be neuroprotective in neurotoxin-induced models of PD (Kim et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Yokoyama et al., 2009) and in genetic models of PD (Delgado-Camprubi et al., 2017). Recently it was reported that preformed fibrils of α-syn also activate PARP-1, and that the accumulation of PAR further accelerates the formation of aggregated α-syn (Kam et al., 2018). This feed forward loop results in cell death via parthanatos, a form of cell death which is defined as being dependent upon PARP-1 activity. This same study demonstrated that treatment with PARP1 inhibitors reduced the aggregation of α-syn, suggesting that this class of drugs, which primarily have been developed for oncology, could potentially be repurposed for therapeutic use in PD.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase inhibition

Lipodomic analysis has indicated that preventing lipid droplet formation increases α-syn toxicity in yeast, rodent and human cells. Specifically, augmenting oleic acid appears to enhance the detrimental effects of accumulating α-syn (Fanning et al., 2019). In agreement with this finding is the discovery that suppressing the oleic acid-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) is protective in various models of α-syn toxicity (including overexpression of α-syn, patient-derived SNCA triplication cells, patient-derived E46K genetic variant cells, and in transgenic E46K mice - (Fanning et al., 2019; Vincent et al., 2018). The biotech firm Yumanity has developed a novel, brain penetrant stearoyl-CoA desaturase inhibitor called YTX-7739, which they have recently initiated a Phase I clinical trial of in 40 healthy volunteers (https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191007005107/en/Yumanity-Therapeutics-Initiates-Phase-1-Clinical-Trial).

Inflammasome inhibition

Inflammation has long been associated with PD, but only recently have very specific forms been identified as potentially playing key roles in the condition. Of particular interest is the activation of the microglial NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inhibition or deficiency of NLRP3 has been shown to rescue models of PD (Fan et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Qiao et al., 2018). Aggregated α-syn has been reported to activate NLRP3 (Codolo et al., 2013), and oral administration of a potent NLRP3 inhibitor in multiple models of PD not only inhibited inflammasome activation, but also rescued motor deficits, prevented neurodegeneration, and also reduced the accumulation of α-syn aggregates (Gordon et al., 2018). The Irish biotech firm Inflazome is now developing several small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors which they are hoping to start clinically testing soon (http://inflazome.com/news-articles/2019/3/24/inflazome-receives-funding-from-the-michael-j-fox-foundation-for-parkinsons-research). Inflazome has recently initiated Phase I testing of their lead compound, an NLRP3 inhibitor called Inzomelid (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04015076).

Proteasome activation

The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the primary cellular mechanism responsible for the degradation of intracellular proteins. Disrupting the proteasome has been suggested to result in the induction of α-syn aggregation (Ebrahimi-Fakhari et al., 2011), and oligomeric α-syn may actually inhibit proteasomal function (Snyder et al., 2003). Numerous small molecule activators of proteasomal activity have been found to reduce levels of aggregated protein in preclinical PD models (Chatterjee et al., 2018; Njomen et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019). Researchers have also devised powerful methods to manipulate proteasome degradation for therapeutic purposes. Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) is one such approach. It involves a two-headed chimeric molecule capable of inducing selective intracellular proteolysis (Sakamoto et al., 2001). A PROTAC contains two linked protein-binding molecules, the first is capable of binding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, while the second attaches to the protein targeted for degradation. Such a system could be utilised in the targeting of aggregated proteins in PD. Oncology has led the way with this approach and the first clinical trial of PROTAC is underway, assessing this methodology in prostate cancer (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03888612).

Deubiquitinating enzymes

In addition to augmenters of proteasomal activation, manipulation of deubiquitinating enzymes is also being explored. For example, inhibition of the deubiquitinase USP9X promotes the accumulation of α-syn and enhances the formation of inclusions (Rott et al., 2011). Likewise, knockdown of Usp8 in Drosophila and human cells increased the lysosomal degradation of α-syn and reduced cell death (Alexopoulou et al., 2016). Deubiquitination is intimately associated with PD, as genetic variants in two genes encoding deubiquitinating enzymes are associated with an increased risk of developing the condition (Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 or UCL1/PARK5 and Ubiquitin specific peptidase 24/PARK10). Multiple biotech firms are attempting to exploit deubiquitinating enzymes, but delivery and toxicity issues have slowed the first clinical trials of deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitors (for example, VLX1570 for multiple myeloma - https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02372240).

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Despite tremendous progress, significant challenges remain for experimental therapies targeting protein aggregation pathology. For example, it is still not entirely clear that the formation of α-syn aggregates is a pathological event in the human brain. Transgenic models of PD - in which large amounts of α-syn aggregates are generated - suggest that they can impair neuronal function and cause neurodegeneration. Post-mortem analysis of human brains suggests protein aggregation is a common feature of the aged brain (Markesbery et al., 2009) and around 10% of aged individuals exhibit α-syn aggregates at death, without displaying evident neurological disease. These individuals are classified as having incidental Lewy body disorder, despite not clearly having a “disorder”. On the other hand, it is possible that they would have developed PD or another related synucleinopathy if they had lived longer (DelleDonne et al., 2008; Dickson et al., 2009; Frigerio et al., 2011). Why then might some “normal” people have α-syn aggregates in the brain? Accumulating evidence suggests that some protein aggregation may be anti-microbial/viral, forming the basis of a cellular defence mechanism (Beatman et al., 2016) and this might be the case for α-syn (Tulisiak et al., 2019). In addition, immunotherapy efforts to target aggregated β-amyloid in AD have thus far failed to slow the neurodegenerative process of the condition, despite substantial clearance of the protein (Y. Wang et al., 2017).

Another challenge facing the clinical evaluation of these experimental therapies is the determination of target engagement. Efforts to image aggregation-prone proteins, such as α-syn, have struggled as the levels of aggregated protein constitute just a tiny fraction of the total protein in the brain and it has consequently been difficult to devise methods to specifically detect the aggregates, either using imaging or biochemistry. Recent studies suggest that method which amplify and quantify small quantities of oligomeric α-syn from CSF, or even plasma, and that the levels are elevated in people suffering from synucleinopathies like PD (Concha-Marambio et al., 2019; Groveman et al., 2018; Paciotti et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019) (ref). Whether changes in the levels of α-syn oligomers in the CSF are also a good measure of target engagement remains to be determined. In the future, the issue of target engagement could be addressed with the use of brain-derived exosomes extracted from serum samples (Athauda et al., 2019), which would represent an enrichment of the α-syn oligomers found in the circulation, but the validation of this method is still being tested and there are no publications yet where this has been applied to α-syn oligomers.

While the path to clinical success of α-syn based therapies in PD is not simple, and there is definitely no guarantee that any of these proposed therapies will be effective, we believe our review gives reasons for hope. First of all, it is remarkable to consider the wide range of approaches that are currently being used to target the likely pathogenicity of α-syn aggregates. Second, attacking the same problem from different angles means that there might also be scope for combination therapies that could be synergistic or additive, even when the effects of the individual therapies alone are insufficient to provide clinical benefit. Third, it is clear that the biotech and pharmaceutical industries are showing great interest in α-syn as a therapeutic target. In light of the great costs involved in developing new CNS drugs, significant financial investments are required to take any α-syn based therapy to market and the current engagement of the industry is therefore very good news for the PD patient community.

Figure 1 A cartoon representation illustrating how immunotherapy and small molecule inhibitors are being tested in PD. Monomeric α-syn is produced (1.), but in PD the protein aggregates for unknown reasons (2.). This oligomerisation is believed to lead to pathology, such as the formation of Lewy bodies (3.). Aggregated α-syn is also released extraneuronally (4.). Immunotherapies (such as Prasinezumab, BIIB054, and PD01A) targeting extracellular α-syn oligomers (5.) are being clinically evaluated to determine if they can slow the spread of the condition. In addition, small molecule inhibitors of α-syn aggregation (such as Anle138b &amp; ENT01) - which are not necessarily limited to the extracellular space - are able to bind to α-syn oligomers (6.) and disaggregate them (7.), reducing levels of both extra- and intracellular oligomeric α-syn.

Figure 2. Lysosomal and autophagic clearance of waste is a necessary cellular function. It begins with the production and lysosomal uptake of digestive enzymes (1.), such as Glucocerebrosidase (GCase). In parallel, waste is collected in autophagosome vesicles (2.), which then dock and fuse with lysosomes (3.). After digestion, the contents of the vesicle can be exocytosed (4.) or recycled. The lysosomal disfunction observed in PD may involve faulty or reduced digestive enzyme activity (for example GCase), which might remain attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or fail to correctly break down proteins in the lysosome, resulting in incomplete digestion of vesicular contents (5.). This situation may cause cellular stress, leading to pathology. Intracellular stress may also be induced by the accumulation of un-recycled waste (6.), which could also lead to PD pathology. Lysosomal therapies being clinically tested for PD are primarily focused on enhancing GCase activity (such as Ambroxol, LTI-291, and PR001), while autophagy inducers (including Nilotinib, K0706, and RTB101) are being evaluated for their ability to increase waste disposal and reduce cellular stress.
