Not all apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers who survive to advanced age develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD); factors attenuating the risk of ε4 on AD may exist. Guided by the top ε4-attenuating signals from methylome-wide association analyses (N = 572, ε4+ and ε4−) of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, we conducted a meta-analysis for pathological AD within the ε4+ subgroups (N = 235) across four independent collections of brains. Cortical RNA-seq and microglial morphology measurements were used in functional analyses. Three out of the four significant CpG dinucleotides were captured by one principal component (PC1), which interacts with ε4 on AD, and is associated with expression of innate immune genes and activated microglia. In ε4 carriers, reduction in each unit of PC1 attenuated the odds of AD by 58% (odds ratio = 2.39, 95% confidence interval = [1.64,3.46], P = 7.08 × 10−6). An epigenomic factor associated with a reduced proportion of activated microglia (epigenomic factor of activated microglia, EFAM) appears to attenuate the risk of ε4 on AD.

pmc1 ∣ NARRATIVE

1.1 ∣ Contextual background

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 haplotype contributes the greatest common genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1-4 However, not all ε4 carriers develop AD. A longitudinal observational study reported that 9 out of the 141 ε4/ε4 individuals remained dementia-free after age 84.5 Another meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies suggested that the ε4 effect on onset of AD becomes weaker after age 70.1 These results indicate that this risk haplotype is not fully penetrant and that factors attenuating the genetic risk of ε4 on AD might exist.

Identifying such an APOE ε4 attenuator would have significant impacts on both therapeutic development and public health. Genome editing techniques bring us the possibility of editing risk-associated alleles from an individual’s genome, but the application of such techniques are still limited to in vitro cell cultures. Thus, it is still impossible to change the genotype of APOE ε4 in living humans, yielding an ongoing ethical debate relating to whether the physician should release the APOE ε4 haplotype information to patients. However, the existence of ε4 attenuators could give us novel and meaningful insights into the development of new, targeted treatments for AD and would enable personalized treatment of ε4 carriers.

Such APOE ε4 haplotype attenuators could be genetic—that is, a genetic variant residing elsewhere in the genome that opposes the effect of ε4—or it could be environmental, a change in cellular function from an external influence that blocks the functional consequences of ε4. Here, we focused on DNA methylation, which can be altered by environmental exposures or life experiences; methylation of selected DNA sequences in the nucleus of cells is a marker for a change in the three-dimensional architecture of DNA in the vicinity of the methylated site. Such conformational changes can be associated with altered patterns of RNA transcription from the DNA.6 Thus, DNA methylation is considered to be part of the epigenome, the three-dimensional architecture of the genome, which can influence the activity of the genomic sequence. DNA methylation is one of the four epigenomic modifications that have the most direct contact with the DNA sequence because a methyl-group is added on top of the DNA nucleotide. In humans, 99% of the DNA methylation occur on a cytosine (“C”) nucleotide that is next to a guanine (“G”) nucleotide, forming a “CpG” dinucleotide in the DNA sequence. Unlike the unmodifiable nature of DNA nucleotide, DNA methylation can be considered a “modifiable” feature because the methyl-group can be either added or removed with the help of an enzyme called DNA methyltransferase or other enzymes. The main focus of our study is to identify those modifiable CpG dinucleotides that may act as an APOE ε4 attenuator. We report the discovery of several locations in the human genome that contain such CpG dinucleotides, sites where a change in DNA methylation is associated with a reduced effect of the APOE ε4 haplotype on risk of AD.

1.2 ∣ Study conclusions and disease implications

Our study explored the epigenome of the human brain for CpG dinucleotides that attenuate the impact of the strongest but not deterministic5 genetic risk of AD in the general population: the APOE ε4 haplotype. Our staged approach identified four CpG dinucleotides on different chromosomes whose level of DNA methylation is associated with AD susceptibility in APOE ε4+ individuals; more specifically, it appears that the burden of tau pathology is associated with DNA methylation at these four sites. While the four CpG dinucleotides are found on different chromosomes, three of them have methylation levels that correlate with one another and represent three independent measurements of the same biological process, so we can collapse them into a single measure, a single principal component (PC1), that is available for each participant. As PC1 gets larger, the risk of AD increases. In downstream analyses, we found that increasing PC1 is also associated with an enlarged proportion of activated microglia in the cortex and that the effect of PC1 is greater in ε4+ than in ε4− participants. Our modeling revealed that each reduction of PC1 in ε4 carriers by 1 unit attenuated risk of AD by 58%, suggesting that we may have found a meaningful ε4 attenuator. Additional work is now needed to further characterize the microglia-related biological process that is captured by PC1 to evaluate whether its effect could potentially be mimicked by a therapeutic agent. Given its functional associations, we rename PC1 as “epigenomic factor of activated microglia” or “EFAM.”

To perform this study, we took advantage of the large and varied sets of molecular and histological data available from the same region of frontal cortex of participants from two longitudinal studies of aging with prospective autopsy—the Religious Order Study (ROS) and the Memory &amp; Aging Project (MAP)—which were designed by a single team of investigators to be analyzed together.7 We therefore refer to them as ROSMAP. We repurposed DNA methylation profiles that we had generated in an earlier study8 to conduct our staged screen of the epigenome for APOE ε4 attenuators. We were able to validate associations with DNA methylation levels at four CpG dinucleotides using data generated from independent collections of brain samples, and we then began to characterize the biology captured by our four CpG dinucleotides. Our initial unbiased analysis of the cortical transcriptome for RNA transcripts that are associated with these CpGs clearly pointed toward the innate immune system and particularly myeloid cells as being the source of the altered CpG methylation in cortical tissue. This led us to focus our attention on this cell type as we dissected the effect of the four CpGs further. Namely, they seem to involve effects on two groups of co-expressed neocortical gene transcripts: module 116, which relates to microglial aging, and module 5, which is associated with the proportion of activated microglia and contributes to the accumulation of tau pathology.9 We previously reported that the proportion of activated microglia was an independent risk factor for AD that had an effect size comparable to that of ε4 on risk of AD.10 Our current findings with the same dataset therefore refine our understanding of the relationship between activated microglia and the ε4 allele: while their effects on risk may be largely independent, they may also interact to some degree.

Our findings that the top four CpG dinucleotides were primarily associated with tau-related pathologies are in line with previous genetic studies revealing the link between APOE and MAPT, the gene encoding the tau protein. A MAPT variant enriched in MAPT H2 carriers conferred greater protection from AD in APOE ε4− individuals.11,12 Further, a recent genome-wide association study stratified by the MAPT haplotype identified an AD susceptibility variant that is enriched in APOE ε3 carriers and is protective in individuals with a MAPT H1H1 genotype.13 These findings alongside ours suggest that variation in the products of the APOE or MAPT loci may interact with one another in different ways to modify AD risk and that this interaction may involve the function of microglial cells. Further, these context-specific factors could establish a link between the APOE (a major risk factor for AD) and MAPT (major risk factor for other tauopathies but, at best, a weak risk factor for AD) loci.

Our study has several limitations. The sample size is limited even though we have assembled the largest available ε4+ study with both DNA methylation and neuropathology data. Having low power is a common issue for all ε4+ subgroup studies.12 Trying to circumvent this issue, we used a staged approach followed by RNA- and histology-based validation. The inclusion of the same ROSMAP subjects in both stage I and stage II may inflate our results, although we use different traits in each stage and impose a 10-fold more stringent significance threshold to address, in part, this issue. Finally, our cross-sectional design using data from samples collected at autopsy cannot determine the causality of the CpG dinucleotides, which is a general limitation of all post mortem autopsy studies for which we can only have one time point.

Overall, we report that the deleterious effect of the strongest genetic risk (APOE ε4) for AD may be attenuated by an epigenomic factor that could work, at least in part, through alterations in the relative proportion of activated microglia (as defined morphologically) and, subsequently, on the accumulation of tau pathology. This suggests that reduction of microglial activity could be a particularly effective intervention in APOE ε4+ individuals who already have evidence of amyloid pathology on imaging or cerebrospinal fluid, and it yields hypotheses that now need to be tested mechanistically to further validate our results and support the proposed sequence of events in which activation of microglia has a strong effect on the accumulation of tau pathology in APOE ε4+ individuals.

2 ∣ CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND STUDY DESIGN

Conducting a DNA methylation genome-wide association study (MWAS) of AD risk within the subgroup of individuals who are ε4+ can provide an unbiased genome-wide-scale search for those unknown signals protecting ε4 carriers from having AD. However, such an analysis is very limited in statistical power, as illustrated by our recent whole exome sequencing study with more than 3000 ε4+ subjects.12 Therefore, we designed a three-stage approach (Figure 1).

In stage I, we took advantage of an existing DNA methylation dataset8 generated from a random subset of ROSMAP participants. This includes both ε4+ and ε4− individuals with detailed quantitative measures of AD neuropathology to maximize power in performing an initial MWAS to prioritize a list of CpG dinucleotides that had the potential to be an ε4 attenuator. The resulting prioritized CpG dinucleotides fulfilled two criteria: (1) be associated with AD pathology in all subjects; and (2) reduce the effect of ε4 on AD susceptibility. The latter is determined by comparing the regression coefficients for the ε4 variable before and after adjusting for each CpG dinucleotide and focusing on those CpG dinucleotides that reduce the unadjusted ε4 regression coefficient.

The prioritized list of 25 CpG dinucleotides from stage I were then moved into stage II, where we checked their associations with AD in the ε4+ subgroup. We then assessed for evidence of replication in independent cohorts, and, to increase the statistical power, we conducted a meta-analysis in stage II to combine data from four independent cohorts and generate a final summary statistic. At the conclusion of the meta-analysis, we identified four CpG sites that might act as the attenuators to the ε4 risk effect on AD; they are cg08706567 at MPL, cg26884773 at TOMM20, cg12307200 between LPP and TPRG1, and cg05157625 at RIN3. Furthermore, we found that the DNA methylation patterns of these four CpG sites and their mutual correlations are similar across different cohorts. For example, the methylation level of three of the CpG dinucleotides—cg08706567, cg26884773, and cg05157625—are correlated (r ≥0.4), and all three are hypomethylated (&lt;50% methylation) across all cohorts. To simplify our downstream analyses, we derived one principal component variable (PC1) to represent the overall effect from these three CpG sites. Each participant therefore has a PC1 value, and we found that, in ε4 carriers, a reduction of one unit of PC1 attenuated the odds of AD by 58% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.64, 3.46], P = 7.08 × 10−6).

In stage III, we conducted validation analyses and explored the possible functional consequences of our four CpG dinucleotides. We found that both PC1 and the level of methylation at the fourth CpG site (cg12307200) are associated with the mRNA expression level of multiple genes in the neocortex of ROSMAP participants, and we replicated this observation in independent datasets. The pathway analysis of these differentially expressed genes suggested the involvement of myeloid cells, which was further supported by our cell type analysis: the altered methylation levels appear to influence microglial gene expression. Finally, we found that both PC1 and cg12307200 have marginal associations with the proportion of histologically defined activated microglia.

In conclusion, we have identified an epigenomic factor—epigenomic factor of activated microglia (EFAM)—which might attenuate the ε4 effect on AD risk through changes in the transcriptome of the neocortex that relate to alterations in the proportion of activated microglia and of their effect on increasing the accumulation of tau pathology.

3 ∣ DETAILED METHODS AND RESULTS

3.1 ∣ Methods

3.1.1 ∣ Study samples and pathological AD measurements

We included Whites from the studies of the ROSMAP studies (www.radc.rush.edu), the MRC London Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank (LBB), and the Mount Sinai Alzheimer’s Disease and Schizophrenia Brain Bank (MSBB; Supplementary Methods and Table S1 in supporting information).7,14,15 The ROS and MAP studies were jointly analyzed as ROSMAP with the adjustment of study variable (ROS and MAP).The LBB (GSE59685) and MSBB (GSE80970) included 68 (ε4+ = 36) and 129 (ε4+ = 41) individuals, respectively. Mayo Clinic Brain Bank (MAYO) provided DNA methylation and temporal cortex gene expression data on 45 patients with definite AD,16,17 diagnosed neuropathologically according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria.18 Both temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex brain tissues were archived frozen. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of each institute.

3.1.2 ∣ Pathological measurements

The pathological diagnosis of AD is based on the Braak score in LBB and MSBB, and the National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan score19,20 in ROSMAP, which relies on both neurofibrillary tangles (Braak) and neuritic plaques (NP). Details of common neuropathologic indices measured in the ROSMAP study were described previously21-24 and in the Supplementary Methods.

3.1.3 ∣ Brain DNA methylation across studies

Details of DNA methylation measurements and data processing of the cortical samples of ROSMAP, LBB, and MSBB were described previously.7,8,14,15 Briefly, the genome-wide DNA methylation was measured by the Illumina 450K methylation array followed by quality control and normalization.8,14,15,25 As a result, β values for 420,132 CpG dinucleotides were included in the ROSMAP MWAS, which yielded the 25 sites for subsequent meta-analysis across ROSMAP, LBB, and MSBB. In MAYO, only cg05157625 is available out of the four top ones, which was measured using the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing as described previously.26

3.1.4 ∣ Brain gene expression in ROSMAP, MSBB, and MAYO

In ROSMAP, there were 421 subjects with both data for DNA methylation and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq; Illumina) from their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex7 (Supplementary Methods). We included the 17,068 autosomal genes in the unit of normalized log2 (cpm) into the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). A subset of these subjects (N = 413) were previously used to derive 47 co-expressed gene module.27

In MSBB, we downloaded transcriptomes from Synapse platform (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7391833). Based on the genotype concordance check (Supplementary Methods), we included 50 subjects who have been profiled with both DNA methylation at prefrontal cortex and RNA-sequencing (Illumina) at BM44 region (closest to the prefrontal cortex).

In MAYO, we included 45 AD cases with both the DNA methylation data at cg05157625 and microarray-based gene expression data from their temporal cortex (Illumina).16,17

3.1.5 ∣ Immunohistochemistry (IHC) measurements of cell types and microglia morphology in ROSMAP

A subset of ROSMAP subjects (N = 57) with RNA-seq dataset were also profiled with IHC staining for markers of different cell types: neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (GFAP), microglia (IBA1), oligodendrocytes (Olig2), and endothelial cells (PECAM-1). The proportion of the microglia cell out of the total number of all different measured cell types were calculated.27 Another subset (N = 136) were evaluated for their microglia activation based on morphology: stage I (thin ramified processes), stage II (plump cytoplasm and thicker processes), and stage III (very condensed cytoplasm). The percentage or the square-root transformed proportion of the stage III activated microglia out of the sum of all three stages counts (PAM) were derived as before.10 These measurements are pre-existing and independent from the current study.

3.1.6 ∣ Statistical analysis

We used generalized linear regression models with the adjustment of age at death, sex, post mortem interval (if applicable), study (for ROSMAP dataset), technical variables, cell proportion15 (if applicable), and APOE ε4 carrying status (if necessary). We applied a Bonferroni correction to the significance threshold. Considering the potential inflation by including the same subjects in stage I and II, we arbitrarily applied 10 times more stringent significance threshold in stage I (P ≤ 1 × 10−8 [0.05/420,132/10]) and in stage II (P ≤ 2 × 10−4 [0.05/25/10]). The correlations between pairs of the top four CpG dinucleotides were presented using R “ggcorrplot” package. The standardized β values (mean = 0 and standard deviation [SD] = 1) of each of the top four CpG dinucleotides in ROSMAP were input to derive four principal components (PCs) in ROSMAP, which were further projected into LBB and MSBB using the R “factoextra” and “prcomp.”

3.1.7 ∣ Pathway analysis

Top TWAS significant genes (P ≤ 2.93 × 10−6 [0.05/17,068 autosomal genes]) were followed with pathway enrichment analysis using “STRINGdb” v10 against the functional Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html)28 with false discovery rate (FDR) correction.29

3.1.8 ∣ Fetal brain Hi-C sequencing data downloaded from GEO

We downloaded (April 24, 2020) the publicly available Hi-C sequencing data of fetal brains30 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE77565) to interrogate the inter-chromosomal interactions. For each of the top four CpG dinucleotides, we extracted its genomic contacts across the 30,376 regions (100 Kb resolutions). Using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, we compared whether the rank of the normalized contact frequency is different between the two types of regions (TWAS or non-TWAS regions).

3.2 ∣ Results

3.2.1 ∣ Demographic characteristics stratified by APOE ε4

In ROSMAP, compared to ε4−, ε4+ participants were younger at the time of death (P = .02), were more likely to have pathological AD (P = 2.48 × 10−9), and had more abnormally phosphorylated tangles (p-tau; P = 2.61 × 10−8) and neuritic amyloid plaque (NP) (P = 5.6 × 10−11; Table 1). In the LBB and MSBB datasets, ε4+ subjects were also more likely to have AD (P &lt; .005) than ε4− subjects.

3.2.2 ∣ Identification of CpG dinucleotides attenuating the effect of APOE ε4 on AD risk

Discovery of CpG dinucleotides

In our stage I analysis with all ROSMAP subjects (Figure 2a and Table S2 in supporting information), 25 CpG dinucleotides (1) were significantly associated with either p-tau or NP (P ≤ 1 × 10−8) and (2) had potential to attenuate the effect of ε4 on p-tau or NP because the regression coefficients of APOE ε4, after adjusting for the candidate CpG dinucleotide, were smaller than the unadjusted ones. These 25 CpG were then evaluated in stage II, where we conducted a meta-analysis across 235 ε4+ individuals assembled from four sample collections: ROS, MAP, LBB, and MSBB. We found four CpG’s associated with a pathologic diagnosis of AD (meta-P ≤ 2 × 10 −4): cg08706567 (MPL), cg26884773 (TOMM20), cg12307200 (LPP and TPRG1), and cg05157625 (RIN3; Figure 2b). These four CpGs have stronger effects on AD susceptibility in ε4+ than ε4−, which is consistently observed across the cohorts (Figure 2c, and Figure S1 in supporting information). For the cg08706567 and cg26884773 dinucleotides, the LBB ε4+ dataset was not included into the meta-analysis since it has the problem of infinite maximum likelihood estimates (P = 1),31 and the results using the penalized generalized regression model yielded significant meta-P (P ≤ .01) including only the LBB and MSBB (Table S3 in supporting information). Thus, the independent cohorts offer evidence of replication for the four prioritized CpG dinucleotides.

Pathological associations of the 4 CpGs

Aside from its strong associations with p-tau and NP, cg12307200 had weaker associations with diffuse amyloid plaques (β = −3.15, standard error [SE] = 1.03, P = 2.34 × 10−3), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (β = −3.36, SE = 1.19, P = 5.07 × 10−3), and arteriosclerosis (β = −3.47, SE = 1.28, P = 6.73 × 10−3); and it had no association with Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, or TDP-43 proteinopathy (P &gt; .05). The other three CpG dinucleotides had weaker associations with NP (β = [3.51,4.07], SE = [0.94,0.5], P = [1.15 × 10−4,2.14 × 10−4]) than p-tau (β = [8.88,9.81], SE = [1.49,1.66], P = [1.33 × 10−5,1.64 × 10−4]), nominal associations with TDP-43 proteinopathy (β = [2.28,3.24], SE = [1.36,1.51], P = [.03,.09]), and no associations with other neuropathologic indices. Thus, the top four CpG dinucleotides were primarily associated with AD-related pathologies (Table S2).

Derivation of a methylation PC based on the 3 validated CpGs that are correlated

All of the subjects have hypermethylation (β ≥ 0.5) at cg12307200 and hypomethylation (β &lt; 0.5) at the other three CpGs in relation to AD. While they are located on different chromosomes, the methylation level of these three CpGs were correlated (r ≥0.4; Figure 3a, Figure S2 in supporting information). Because such patterns were consistently observed across all of the cohorts, we derived a methylation-based PC1 that captures the effect of those three highly correlated CpGs in a single measure. We developed it using ROSMAP data and then projected it to the samples from LBB and MSBB using eigenvectors. As expected, the projected PC1 in LBB and MSBB captured the three CpG dinucleotides in the same way as in ROSMAP (Figure 3b).

Interaction between APOE ε4 and the top CpG dinucleotides on AD risk

We evaluated whether our epigenomic factors interacted with APOE ε4 to modulate AD risk and compared their effects on AD after stratification by ε4. The cg12307200 site did not display significant evidence of interaction, but the three correlated CpG dinucleotides captured by PC1 had nominal significance for ε4 interaction (range of meta-P for interaction = [6.1 × 10−4,0.01]; Figure 3c). This led us to pursue a more comprehensive interaction analysis of PC1 both categorically and continuously. For the categorical interaction, the original continuous PC1 was transformed to a binary variable based on its median value. For the continuous interaction, the non-scaled continuous value of the PC1 was used. The results were similar for both the non-scaled and scaled values (Table S4 in supporting information), ruling out the potential influences of outliers on the continuous analysis. Both the categorical (meta-P = 2.8 × 10−4) and continuous (meta-P = 7.7 × 10−4) interaction tests were significant. In the categorical analysis, the effect of ε4 on AD was smaller in the subjects with low PC1 (meta-OR = 2.57, 95% CI = [1.51,4.39], P = 5.13 × 10−4) than in the subjects with high PC1 (meta-OR = 16.16, 95% CI = [6.45,40.51], P = 2.93 × 10−9). In the continuous analysis, the effect of PC1 on AD risk was greater in ε4+ (meta-ln [OR] = 0.87, meta-P = 7.08 × 10−6, meta-N = 235) than in the ε4− (meta-ln [OR] = 0.20, P = 2.65 × 10−3, meta-N = 532). In other words, reduction of one unit in PC1 was associated with a 58% ([1-1/exp(0.87)]) attenuation in AD risk in ε4+ carriers. Thus, one could potentially influence the magnitude of ε4 risk by modulating PC1, an epigenomic measure that captures the effect of multiple loci.

Functional exploration of neocortical ROSMAP transcriptomes, replication in other independent datasets and validation by Hi-C sequencing data of fetal brains

To understand the functional consequences of our four CpG dinucleotides, we conducted a TWAS in the 421 ROSMAP participants who have both DNA methylation and RNA sequence (RNA-seq) data from the same cortical region. There were 71 genes that displayed significant (P &lt; 2.93 × 10−6 [0.05/17,068 autosomal genes]) associations with either PC1 (70 genes) or cg12307200 (three genes; Figure 4a&amp;b, Table S5 in supporting information). Except for RIN3 – where there was a cis-effect of the DNA methylation on gene expression – all of the other associations are driven by trans-effects because the TWAS target genes are far from the four CpG dinucleotides: they are either on different chromosomes or &gt;5 Mb apart for those found on the same chromosome.

We then attempted to replicate our TWAS findings. In MSBB (50 subjects), the effect of cg12307200 was not replicated. But the majority of the PC1 TWAS genes were replicated. Out of the total of 68 genes also available in MSBB, 94% have the same effect direction as in ROSMAP, and 59% also showed significance (P &lt; .05; Figure 4c). In MAYO (45 AD cases), only one of the three PC1 CpGs (cg05157625) was available. Out of the 21 TWAS genes significant with both PC1 and cg05157625 in ROSMAP, 85% have the same effect direction in MAYO as in ROSMAP (Figure 4d). Four genes are significant in both MAYO and MSBB in relation to PC1, despite the small sample sizes.

To further explore the biological grounding of our observation, we accessed the publicly available Hi-C sequencing data from human fetal brain tissue, which captures the three-dimensional architecture of human cortex, with the caveat that these profile a stage of brain development. Despite this important limitation, we found evidence that those genomic regions containing the 71 TWAS genes identified in ROSMAP have more contacts with the region covering one of the three PC1 CpGs, cg08706567, than you would expect by chance (P &lt; .01; Figure 4e). This suggests that, even at very early stages of brain development, the 71 TWAS genes are physically interacting with at least one element of PC1; cg08706567 may play an important role as a regulator locus whose impact continues in advancing age as it influences the impact of ε4.

3.2.3 ∣ The TWAS results implicate microglial activation in the effect on ε4

Pathway analysis of TWAS results suggested the involvement of the myeloid cells

These 71 TWAS significant genes displayed enrichment for 20 KEGG functional pathways (FDR ≤ 0.05, hits &gt;1 and hits% ≥3%; Figure 5a), which were related to multiple aspects of immunity and particularly myeloid cell function, such as osteoclast differentiation (hits = 4%, FDR-P = 5.5 × 10−5), phagosome (hits = 4%, FDR-P = 5.5 × 10−5), tuberculosis (hits = 3%, FDR-P = 5.5 × 10−5), Leishmaniasis (hits = 4%, FDR-P = 1.3 × 10−3), and antigen processing and presentation (hits = 3%, FDR-P = 0.01).

Association with co-expressed gene modules of microglia

We conducted a complementary association analysis with the seven modules of co-expressed neocortical genes previously described as being enriched for microglial genes:9,27 m5, m113, m114, m115, m116, m112, and m117. PC1 was associated with the expression of five of these seven microglia modules (P ≤ 7.14 × 10−3 [0.05/7 microglia modules]; Figure 5b) but not other non-microglial modules (Table S6 in supporting information). Further, almost all (91%) of the 71 TWAS genes were found in the five significant microglia modules, and 58% belonged to m116, the most microglial enriched module; we previously reported27 this module as being related to microglial aging.9 It also contains some key AD genes such as TREM2 and its binding partner TYROBP. m5 has been associated the burden of tau pathology and the proportion of activated microglia (PAM), as defined using data from IHC of brain sections and a standard neuropathologic scale based on microglial morphology.9,10 Our findings do not appear to be driven by changes in microglial cell counts as neither PC1 nor cg12307200 was associated with microglia cell counts estimated using either IHC staining for the IBA1 protein or its mRNA expression levels (Table S7 in supporting information). The results remain significant when we account for the proportion of microglial cells in the tissue. Overall, our four epigenomic factors appeared to be related to microglial transcriptional programs captured by the modules of co-expressed genes defined in neocortical data, and the state of the microglia may thus be an important factor in the modulation of the ε4 effect.

Validation using a histology-derived variable of microglia activation

As noted above, the m5 module was associated with PAM, a trait derived from the morphological characterization of microglia in histological sections that we found to be associated with cognitive decline, AD pathologies, and AD dementia.10 PAM is simply the proportion of microglia that have an activated stage III morphology, and this trait was available in 122 ROSMAP participants that also have DNA methylation data from the same frontal cortex region. PC1 was positively (P = .02) and cg12307200 was negatively associated with PAM in the midfrontal cortex (P = .05; Figure 5c,d). However, the association is modest, and the effect of PC1 was not fully explained by PAM. That is, PAM and PC1 capture somewhat different aspects of microglial function that may be partially related to one another. To be thorough, we also evaluated PAM measures in three other brain regions in secondary analyses, and we found that PAM in inferior temporal cortex, posterior putamen, and ventral medial caudate also displayed association with PC1 and cg12307200 (Figure S2), suggesting that PC1 and cg12307200 derived from cortical tissue DNA methylation data capture an aspect of microglial state in multiple brain regions, not just the frontal cortex.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic Review: The authors reviewed the published literature (e.g., PubMed) on the associations between apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which suggest that suppressors of the ε4 risk on AD may exist.

Interpretation: The alteration of methylation values of four CpG sites reduce the ε4 risk on pathological AD by 58% and these sites regulate the mRNA expressions of immune genes related to microglia, which was confirmed by the immunohistochemistry experiments. Having a low proportion of activated microglia may act as a suppressor of ε4 effect on AD by epigenomic mechanisms.

Future Directions: Larger scale human and mechanistic studies are necessary to confirm our findings and identify the upstream environmental factors and the molecular pathways involved in attenuating the effect of ε4.
