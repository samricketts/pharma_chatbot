Amyloid-beta peptides generated by β-secretase- and γ-secretase-mediated successive cleavage of amyloid precursor protein are believed to play a causative role in Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, reducing amyloid-beta generation by modulating γ-secretase remains a promising approach for Alzheimer’s disease therapeutic development. Here, we screened fruit extracts of Ligustrum lucidum Ait. (Oleaceae) and identified active fractions that increase the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein and reduce amyloid-beta production in a neuronal cell line. These fractions contain a mixture of two isomeric pentacyclic triterpene natural products, 3-O-cis- or 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl maslinic acid (OCMA), in different ratios. We further demonstrated that trans-OCMA specifically inhibits γ-secretase and decreases amyloid-beta levels without influencing cleavage of Notch. By using photoactivatable probes targeting the subsites residing in the γ-secretase active site, we demonstrated that trans-OCMA selectively affects the S1 subsite of the active site in this protease. Treatment of Alzheimer’s disease transgenic model mice with trans-OCMA or an analogous carbamate derivative of a related pentacyclic triterpene natural product, oleanolic acid, rescued the impairment of synaptic plasticity. This work indicates that the naturally occurring compound trans-OCMA and its analogues could become a promising class of small molecules for Alzheimer’s disease treatment.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the elderly and is characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain.1 Given its increasing prevalence due to population aging, AD is a major threat to society. As there is no effective treatment that can halt or slow AD progression, screening for molecules with therapeutic potential for AD treatment is the most in-demand yet challenging task.2 Accumulating evidence suggests that neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides are one of the major causative factors of AD.3-6 Aβ peptides are generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1), generating the C-terminal fragment of APP (APP-CTF), which is in turn cleaved by γ-secretase (GS) to yield Aβ peptides. Aβ peptides are 38–43 amino acids long, and Aβ42 is the major constituent of amyloid plaques deposited in the AD brain.7 Numerous studies have shown that Aβ42 is most prone to aggregation and that its aggregated forms have neurotoxic activities including decreasing synaptic number and inhibiting long-term potentiation (LTP).8 Aβ accumulation represents one of the major AD biomarkers9 and is likely a key driver of AD pathogenesis.8 Indeed, targeting BACE1 and GS is a compelling therapeutic approach for AD drug development.10

GS is an intramembrane protease complex that cleaves over 100 transmembrane proteins.11,12 The GS complex comprises multiple protein subunits including presenilin-1/2 (PS1/2), presenilin enhancer 2, nicastrin, and anterior pharynx-defective 1. PS1/2 are the catalytic subunits of the complex,12-14 and their autosomal dominant alleles are major genetic causes of some cases of familial AD.15 Over the past 20 years, more than a dozen GS inhibitors (GSIs) and GS modulators have been identified, some of which entered clinical trials.16-18 However, none succeeded because of their nonspecific inhibition of Notch signaling, resulting in side-effects including gastrointestinal discomfort, skin lesions, and worsening cognitive function.19 These findings indicate an urgent need to identify alternative inhibitors/modulators of GS.

Traditional Chinese medicine and medicinal plants have been used to treat human diseases and maintain health in China and neighboring countries for more than 3000 years.20,21 These plants contain innumerable bioactive compounds but remain a largely untapped resource for drug development.22 Reportedly, a large proportion of active compounds and medicines currently used for central nervous system disorders are of natural origin or are modified from such compounds.23 Our laboratory has been investigating extracts of medicinal plants with reported antiaging effects to identify potential druglike analogues/derivatives for the treatment of AD and other neurological disorders.24,25 We have screened several herbal plant extracts and performed activity-guided fractionation of the fruit extracts of Ligustrum lucidum Ait., a flowering plant of the olive family (Oleaceae),26 to identify active fractions and pure constituents that decrease Aβ production.

Here, we report that two active fractions, RF9-C31 and RF9-C32, from the fruit extracts of L. lucidum reduced Aβ production in neuroblastoma cells overexpressing human APP. These fractions primarily contained maslinic acid (MA) derivatives, 3-O-cis-p-coumaroyl-maslinic acid (cis-OCMA) and 3-O-trans-p-coumaroyl-maslinic acid (trans-OCMA) (Figure 1). We also evaluated eight synthetic trans-OCMA and other oleanolic acid (OA) and MA derivatives, including the previously described oleanolic acid benzyl carbamate27 (OABC) derivative and showed that both trans-OCMA and OABC reduced Aβ production by inhibiting GS without affecting Notch cleavage. Furthermore, we showed that injection of trans-OCMA or OABC alleviated the synaptic plasticity impairment in an AD transgenic model mice. Our results collectively indicate that trans-OCMA isolated from L. lucidum is a Notch-sparing GSI that exhibits a potential beneficial effect by alleviating AD pathology.

RESULTS

Active L. lucidum Fruit Extract Fractions Increase APP-CTF and Reduce Aβ Production.

Our primary screening identified several herb extracts whose activity increased APP-CTFs levels in neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing human APP695 (“N2a695 cells” hereafter) (Figure S1). In this study, we focused on L. lucidum fruit extracts and performed further fractionation and purification to obtain various fractions (Figure S2). To identify the active fractions, N2a695 cells were treated with different fractions of L. lucidum fruit extracts, including fractions RF9-C24–RF9-C32, and their effects on Aβ production were determined. Most of these fractions primarily contained one compound, whereas fractions RF9-C31 and RF9-C32 contained two compounds in unequal ratios, as evident from the HPLC chromatograms (Figures S3 and S4). We found that the cellular APP-CTF levels increased in cells treated with RF9-C31 or RF9-C32 (Figure 2A). We further examined the activities of these two fractions in Aβ production and demonstrated that both fractions decreased extracellular Aβ levels in the cell medium and increased the cellular APP-CTF level in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B). Moreover, by using metabolic labeling with 35S-methionine/cysteine, we showed that RF9-C31 treatment inhibited the production of newly synthesized endogenous murine Aβ and Aβ1–40/42 in rat primary neurons (Figure 2C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that both RF9-C31 and RF9-C32 inhibit Aβ production and increase APP-CTF, suggesting inhibition of GS-mediated APP-CTF cleavage.

trans-OCMA Reduces Aβ Production in N2a695 Cells and Modulates GS Activity In Vitro.

Spectral data analysis revealed that RF9-C31 and RF9-C32 contained varying amounts of stereoisomeric cis- and trans-OCMA, with RF9-C31 containing more trans-OCMA (Figure S4). To confirm that trans-OCMA is the active Aβ-lowering component of RF9-C31, we designed and synthesized trans-OCMA from the readily available starting material, OA (Scheme S1), and evaluated its Aβ-lowering activity in N2a695 cells. Accordingly, trans-OCMA reduced the levels of Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A). To verify that trans-OCMA reduces Aβ production by targeting GS, we performed an in vitro GS activity assay.28,29 As shown in Figure 3B, trans-OCMA inhibited the production of all three Aβ species with IC50 values of 1.17, 0.30, and 0.46 μM for Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ38, respectively, suggesting that trans-OCMA directly inhibits GS activity. The difference in the IC50 values for Aβ40 and Aβ42 is approximately 4 fold, suggesting that this compound has moderate selectivity against Aβ42.

trans-OCMA Modulates the Active Site of GS.

PS1 is the catalytic component of the GS complex.30 Active site-directed, photoaffinity labeling probes have proven to be an effective tool for providing insight into the GS catalytic active site located at the interface of 2 PS1 subunits.18 To examine how trans-OCMA affects GS activity, we performed photoaffinity labeling of the enzyme using active site-directed probes31 in the presence or absence of trans-OCMA. The photophore walking probes used in the competitive assay, JC-8, L646, L505, and GY-4, label the S1′, S2, S3′, and S1 subsites, respectively, within the active site (i.e., PS1) of the GS complex. trans-OCMA completely abolished PS1 labeling by GY-4. While trans-OCMA decreased labeling by JC-8 and increased that by L646, it did not alter labeling by L505 (Figure 3C). These results suggest that, distinct from other known GSIs, trans-OCMA affects the S1 substrate–enzyme interface and induces a unique conformational change of the GS enzyme complex.31

trans-OCMA Does Not Affect Notch Cleavage.

As mentioned above, GSIs evaluated in clinical trials for patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment were unsuccessful or even exacerbated cognitive function impairment.19,32 One possible explanation is that these GSIs interfered with the cleavage of Notch by GS, consequently initiating side effects due to the inhibition of the physiological functions of the proteolytic fragment of Notch (Notch intracellular domain [NICD]).33 Therefore, we examined whether trans-OCMA inhibits Notch cleavage by detecting the level of NICD generated from NotchΔE-myc, a substrate for GS. In N2a cells that expressed NotchΔE-myc, administration of the GSI l-685,458 potently inhibited the production of NICD fragment, as indicated by an anti-myc antibody or specific antibody against the cleaved N-terminal of NICD (Figure 3D, right panel). However, trans-OCMA did not affect the cleavage of full-length Notch into the NICD product (Figure 3D, left panel). These results suggest that trans-OCMA is a GSI that does not cleave Notch, making it a Notch-sparing GSI.34

Semisynthetic trans-OCMA as Well as OA and MA Derivatives Reduce Aβ Production in Cells.

The synthesis of trans-OCMA from OA was achieved in six chemical steps, with an overall yield of approximately 2% (Scheme S1 and Figure S2). To examine the role of the coumaroyl moiety in trans-OCMA on its activity, we obtained parent compounds OA and MA (Figure 1) as well as several derivatives including OA-1–OA-4 and MA-1–MA-5 (Table 1).35-38 First, we determined the effects of MA in N2a695 cells by measuring the total Aβ level using Western blot analysis. We found that Aβ levels increased greatly compared to the DMSO control (data not shown). We subsequently evaluated OA and all OA and MA analogues, including OA-1–OA-4 and MA-1–MA-5, in N2a695 cells and determined the effects on Aβ production by ELISA. Thus, we found that, unlike trans-OCMA, the majority of compounds increased Aβ levels. OA increased both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels by 15–25%, while all OA and MA derivatives except OA-1 and OA-2 considerably increased Aβ42 levels. Only OA-1 reduced both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. Based on these experiments, the GS inhibitory activity of trans-OCMA is attributable to the presence of a coumaroyl moiety at its C3 position.

Meanwhile, we also prepared and evaluated the previously described benzyl carbamate derivative of OA: OABC.27 We selected OABC for our study, because carbamate compounds are nonnative substrates of endogenous lipase enzymes and are cleaved less efficiently than an ester in vivo.39 In addition, OABC can be prepared in a single-step reaction (Figure S5) by reacting OA with benzyl isocyanate in the presence of copper chloride in hot toluene.40 We found that OABC reduced the production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 with activities comparable to that of trans-OCMA (Figure 3B and S5). The IC50 values of OABC against Aβ40 and Aβ42 were 0.57 and 0.65 μM, respectively. On the other hand, OABC treatment reduced the Aβ level in N2a695 cell-conditioned media by 10–40%. Furthermore, OABC and OA at 5 μM exhibited no toxicity in N2a695 cells in an MTT assay (Figure S5).

trans-OCMA and OABC Rescue Synaptic Plasticity Impairment in Alzheimer’s Disease Transgenic Model Mice.

As Aβ levels increase, Aβ monomers aggregate into oligomers and bind to excitatory synapses in the hippocampus, consequently impairing synaptic plasticity.3-5 In APP/PS1 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD, synaptic plasticity impairment manifests as a reduction of LTP.41 Given that trans-OCMA and OABC inhibit Aβ production, we investigated their effects on LTP impairment in APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice exhibited a significant impairment in field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) compared to their nontransgenic littermates. Treatment with either trans-OCMA or OABC significantly improved LTP and rescued the LTP impairment in APP/PS1 mice (Figure 4A). To determine the brain penetration of trans-OCMA and OABC, we administered the compounds intraperitoneally and measured their concentrations in plasma and brain tissue in C57BL/6 mice after a single injection. Both trans-OCMA and OABC showed their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, reaching the micromolar range with peak concentrations (i.e., Cmax) in the brain of 1.75 and 2.09 μM for trans-OCMA and OABC, respectively (Figure 4B and Table 2).

DISCUSSION

Developing natural products as specific GSIs or GS modulators42 to reduce Aβ generation from APP is a promising approach for AD drug development.43,44 In the present study, we identified trans-OCMA, which reduces the processing of APP into Aβ, as a naturally occurring and Notch-sparing GSI. trans-OCMA is one of the 40 known triterpenes and the major active constituent in the fruit of L. lucidum. It was first isolated from Zizyphus jujuba45 and subsequently from Tetracera boiviniana,46 Prinsepia utiliz,47 and nu zhen zi, the dried ripe fruit of the evergreen tree L. lucidum in this study. L. lucidum is designated a “top-tier” medicine owing to its safety for long-term use for antiaging purposes. In addition to its antiaging property, L. lucidum extract possesses antiosteoporotic, antioxidative, antidiabetic, and antitumor properties26,48,49 and is a constituent of the Bushen–Yizhi formula, which attenuates behavioral deficits in AD transgenic mice.50 Apart from trans-OCMA, glucosides of L. lucidum have been shown to activate the transcription factor CREB, which is associated with memory enhancement.51 Therefore, it will be interesting to investigate the combinational effects of different ingredients in the herb.

trans-OCMA inhibited the GS cleavage of APP but did not alter the Aβ42/Aβ40/Aβ38 ratio. Unlike most existing GSIs/GS modulators, trans-OCMA specifically inhibits APP processing and does not cleave Notch, which is another common substrate of GS, suggesting that trans-OCMA is a Notch-sparing GSI. It differs from other Notch-sparing GSIs (e.g., CS-1 and BMS-708163) that inhibit two or four photoprobes (e.g., JC-8, L646, GY-4, and L505) from binding to PS1-NTF.52,53 trans-OCMA only competes with the binding of GY-4 to the S1 site of the GS active pocket. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether it does so directly or indirectly by allosterically modulating the conformation of PS1. Because the lipid microenvironment surrounding GS can influence its enzyme activity,54 there is a possibility that trans-OCMA interferes with the lipid microenvironment owing to its hydrophobicity, thereby affecting the conformation of PS1. Therefore, further investigation is required to understand the mechanism underpinning the GSI activity of trans-OCMA, specifically whether its GY-4-competing activity accounts for its Notch-sparing activity.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to show the modulatory effect of the antiaging medicinal herb, L. lucidum, in APP processing and that its active ingredient, trans-OCMA, has an in vivo effect on the central nervous system. While the molecular size of trans-OCMA is greater than 600, and its physicochemical properties are unfavorable for central nervous system applications,55 trans-OCMA can be detected in the brain upon systemic injection and reverses functional deficits in AD model mice. Moreover, as the development of synthetic compounds facilitates drug development, we have established a six-step synthetic route to generate trans-OCMA from OA, which is abundant in olive plants.56,57 This semisynthetic trans-OCMA exhibits a GS inhibitory activity similar to that of natural trans-OCMA and reduces Aβ40 and Aβ42 production in cells. The non-natural OA carbamate derivative, OABC, which is prepared semisynthetically, conveniently starting with OA in a single step, was also active in our assays, including in the Aβ production assay in cells and the GSI activity assay in vitro. Systemic delivery of trans-OCMA or its carbamate derivative OABC into AD transgenic model mice alleviates functional defects. Thus, trans-OCMA and OABC are promising candidates for further therapeutic development.

METHODS

Plant Extract Fractions, Semisynthetic Natural Product, and Analogues.

Ligustrum lucidum Aiton fruits were purchased from a reputable vendor in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, and a voucher of specimen (TCM-009) was kept at the Molecular Neuroscience Center at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Fractionation of L. lucidum to yield RF9-C24–RF9-C32 is described in Figure S2. While RF9-C31 and RF9-C32 contained varying amounts of cis- or trans-OCMA, other fractions contained a single major compound of purity over 90% (Figures S3 and S4). trans-OCMA was semisynthesized in six steps using OA as the starting backbone. The synthetic route is shown in Scheme S1, and the identity of compounds was characterized by 13C and 1H NMR (Figure S6). OABC was semisynthesized in one step,27 and Aβ lowering activity is shown in Figure S5.

Cell Lines.

N2a695 cells were available in-house and were cultured in 1:1 Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Media (Life Technologies): Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ([+] 4.5 g/L D-glucose; [+] l-glutamine; [−] sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies)) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.4% Penstrep, and 0.4% Geneticin and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HeLa-S3 cells were purchased from Cell Culture Company, and membranes were prepared as previously described.58

Compound Treatment.

Six-well tissue culture plates (Corning) were seeded with N2a695 cells (4.0 × 105–4.5 × 105 cells/mL, 2 mL/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C (5% CO2 atmosphere). The next day, the cell media (&gt;95% confluent) was exchanged with fresh media containing fractions or synthetic trans-OCMA or OABC (10 μM or lower concentration, prepared from 10 mM solution in DMSO), and cells were further incubated for 5 h. Cell media was collected for determining Aβ concentration. Remaining cells were scraped in cold Dulbecco’s PBS buffer (1 mL) in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) and centrifuged for 1 min at 13 000 rpm at 4 °C. Resulting cell pellets were lysed in 3% SDS by sonication to afford cell lysates for performing Western blotting experiments.

Western Blots.

Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and the protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). The same amount of protein lysate (50 μg) per sample was loaded for SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes for blotting following electrophoresis. Full length APP (APP-FL) was detected with 6E10 (Covance). Full length Notch was detected with the 9E10 myc antibody (Invitrogen). The NICD specific antibody was an antibody against cleaved Notch1 (Val1744, Cell signaling). APP-CTFs were detected with the RU369 antibody.59 PS1-NTF antibody was detected with Ab14.60 Total Aβ in the media was determined by immunoprecipitation with the 4G8 antibody and blotting with the 6E10 antibody.

Measurement of Aβ by ELISA.

The levels of Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 in culture media were measured in a 96-well V-Plex Plus MSD (Mesoscale Discovery) plate using the Aβ Peptide Panel 1 (6E10) Kit (catalog number K15200G) by following the manufacturer’s instructions. The signals for Aβ were measured using the SQ120 MSD ELISA reader. In some experiments, the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the culture media were measured by using an ELISA kit specific for human Aβ40 (Thermo Fisher # KHB3481) or Aβ42 (Thermo Fisher # KHB3441) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Signals for Aβ were measured using a PerkinElmer Envision ELISA reader.

Measuring Endogenous Rat Aβ Synthesis in Primary Rat Neurons by Metabolic Labeling.

Primary rat prenatal cortical neurons were treated with 0, 1, or 5 μM RF9-C31 for 4 h and then metabolically labeled for 6 h using 35S-methionine/cysteine protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer). The levels of murine Aβ1–40/42 and Aβ11–40/42 species in the media were determined by immunoprecipitation using antibody 4G8 followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.61

γ-Secretase Activity Assay.

HeLa membranes were labeled with active site-directed photoprobes L646, L505, GY-4, or JC-8 in the presence or absence of trans-OCMA. This was followed by Western blot of PS1-NTF and -CTF after pull-down with streptavidin resin.58 In vitro GS activity assay by incubating recombinant APP-CTF substrate (SB4) with cell membranes prepared from HeLa cells was performed, as described previously.28,61,62

Notch Cleavage Assay.

N2a cells were transfected with the NotchΔE construct (myc-tagged at NT)61 for 2 days followed with treatment with trans-OCMA or L-685,458 for 24 h. The expression of full-length Notch was analyzed by Western blot using the anti-myc antibody. The cleaved NICD was detected with a cleavage-specific antibody (Notch1 Val-1744, Cell Signaling).

Animals and Electrophysiological Measurement.

The AD model mice used were APP/PS1 double-transgenic (B6C3-Tg [APPswe, PS1dE9]85Dbo/J) mice obtained from Jackson Laboratory. They were maintained and bred in the Animal and Plant Care Facility of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of HKUST and conducted in accordance with the Code of Practice Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes of Hong Kong. trans-OCMA in 85 μmol/kg body weight (injection volume 10 mL/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into 6–7 month old APP/PS1 mice daily for 4 weeks. Mice injected with vehicle (3% dimethyl sulfoxide/10% Tween-80 in water (3:10:87 by volume) served as controls. LTP was measured in the hippocampal Schaffer-collateral (SC) pathway after high-frequency stimulation (HFS). To measure LTP after the 4 week treatment, we sacrificed the mice by decapitation. Whole brains were immediately resected and soaked in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) supplemented in 95% O2/5% CO2. Brain slices (300 μm) were then prepared using a vibratome (HM650V; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and soaked in oxygenated aCSF for 2 h at 32 °C for recovery. LTP formations were recorded using a multielectrode array system (MED-64, Panasonic International, Inc.) and paradigms were conducted as previously described.24,25

Pharmacokinetic Study.

trans-OCMA and OABC were prepared in 3% dimethyl sulfoxide/10% Tween-80 in water (3:10:87 by volume). C57BL/6 mice at 12 weeks old (males) were injected with the compound at a dose of 85 μmol/kg (52.5 mg/kg trans-OCMA; 50.0 mg/kg OABC) body weight (injection volume 10 mL/kg). Samples were collected at different postinjection time points (n = 4 per time point, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 , 72, 96 h) from mice under deep anesthesia by isoflurane inhalation. Plasma was separated from blood collected by cardiac puncture, and the whole brain was collected after transcardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. The amount of trans-OCMA and OABC in the brain or plasma samples was determined using triple-Q mass spectrometry (AB SCIEX 4500 QTRAP system). Details of the detection parameters are provided in the Supporting Information.

Statistical Analysis.

The investigators who performed the electrophysiology and pharmacokinetic studies were blinded to the genotypes and treatments of the mice. All data are expressed as arithmetic mean ± SEM. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism ver. 6.0. The significance of differences was assessed by using unpaired Student’s t test or one- or two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test as indicated. The level of significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.

Figure 2. Active fractions RF9-C31 and RF9-C32 from L. lucidum extracts induced APP-CTF accumulation and reduced Aβ production. (A) N2a695 cells were treated with fractions (10 μM) isolated from L. lucidum for 24 h. Representative Western blots showing the levels of full-length APP (APP-FL), APP-CTF, and presenilin-1 NTF (PS1-NTF). (B) Dose–response effects of RF9-C31 and RF9-C32 on APP-CTF and total Aβ levels. N2a695 cells were treated with RF9-C31 or RF9-C32 for 24 h. (C) RF9-C31 reduced endogenous production of Aβ1–40/42. Primary rat prenatal cortical neurons were pretreated with RF9-C31 and metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine/cysteine protein mix in the presence of RF9-C31. Immunoprecipitated Aβ species from the conditioned media were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (upper), and quantification analysis is shown as a bar graph (lower) (*P &lt; 0.05, ***P &lt; 0.005 vs control; one-way ANOVA).

Figure 3. trans-OCMA specifically inhibits Aβ production by regulating GS activity without affecting Notch1 cleavage. (A) APP-CTF-expressing N2a cells were treated with trans-OCMA for 24 h. The dose–response relationships between trans-OCMA treatment and Aβ38, Aβ40, or Aβ42 production were determined by amyloid triplex assay. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA. Data are presented as mean ± SD (**P &lt; 0.01). (B) trans-OCMA inhibited Aβ38, Aβ40, and Aβ42 production in a membrane-based in vitro GS activity assay. (C) trans-OCMA selectively blocked the binding of GY-4 to the PS1 active site (PS1-NTF). (D) trans-OCMA did not affect the GS-mediated production of NICD from NotchΔE-myc. Upper panel: Full-length NotchΔE (upper band) and its cleavage product, NICD (lower band), were detected with an anti-myc antibody. Lower panel: NICD cleavage fragment was recognized by an anti-NICD antibody.

Figure 4. trans-OCMA and OABC rescue LTP deficits in APP/PS1 mice and can cross the blood–brain barrier. (A) APP/PS1 (Tg) or wild-type (WT) mice were intraperitoneally injected with trans-OCMA or OABC at 85 μmol/kg or vehicle control (Con) for 4 weeks (see Methods). Data represent averaged slopes of baseline-normalized fEPSP (mean ± SEM). Trace recordings 30 min before and 60 min after LTP induction by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) are shown (left). Quantification of mean fEPSP slopes in the last 10 min of recording after LTP induction (data are mean ± SEM; n = 5–6 slices from 3 brains per condition). Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test (*P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01) (right). (B) Detection of trans-OCMA and OABC in the plasma and brain of C57BL/6 mice after a single intraperitoneal injection.
