pmcIntroduction

In the United States alone, over six million individuals are living with symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), and 46 million are in the preclinical stage of AD; this prevalence is expected to grow as our population ages (Brookmeyer et al., 2018). The preclinical stage of AD is a long period, up to 20 years, in which abnormal changes are accumulating in the brain but hallmark symptoms of impaired memory and cognition (i.e., symptomatic AD) have not yet appeared (Jack et al., 2018). Preclinical AD is detected through biomarker assessments of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (Price &amp; Morris, 1999; Jack et al., 2018). Amyloid and tau are proteins that accumulate in the brain, and their presence can be measured by positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or through cerebral spinal fluid (Jack et al., 2018; Fagan et al., 2006). Neurodegeneration can be identified using structural (volume of brain) or functional (strength of brain network connections) MRI; decreases in hippocampal volume (Gordon et al., 2016) and resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) intranetwork strength (Wisch et al., 2020) occur during the progression to symptomatic AD (Badhwar et al., 2017). Neurodegeneration may be associated with AD pathology (amyloid and tau) or vascular factors such as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, or history of stroke (Gorelick et al., 2011).

During preclinical AD, these biomarkers appear years prior to the onset of symptomatic AD (amyloid, 20 years prior; tau, 10–15 years prior; neurodegeneration, 0–5 years prior; Jack et al., 2013). Detectable impairment in memory or cognition marks an individual’s transition to the symptomatic stage of AD; the beginning of the symptomatic stage is often referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI; Jack et al., 2018).

Little is known about subtle behavioral or functional impairments in daily life activities during the preclinical stage of AD. The application of cognition in real-life contexts can be referred to as functional cognition (Skidmore, 2017; Wolf et al., 2019). Both constructs of function and cognition are relevant to diagnosing and staging the progression of AD (Morris, 1997). Functional cognition can be assessed using complex, cognitively focused instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), such as managing medications or balancing a checkbook.

There are two ways to assess IADL: questionnaires and performance-based assessments. In clinical practice and in AD research, IADL function is often assessed using self- or proxy-reported questionnaires. IADL questionnaires are quick, simple to administer, and provide important subjective perspectives of function. However, limitations include their potential to be impacted by bias, lack of self or proxy insight, lack of sensitivity, and if required, a proxy’s participation. IADL questionnaires do not indicate impairment until the symptomatic stage of AD, or MCI (Puente et al., 2014).

Performance-based assessments involve actual performance of an IADL. They require more training, time to administer, and preparation of materials. However, a major strength of these assessments is their sensitivity. Objective scoring of observed performance offers greater potential to detect impairments in functional cognition. Assessing IADL using a performance-based measure has been found to detect differences between older adults with MCI and those with normal cognition (Ciro et al., 2015; Rodakowski et al., 2014), where self- or proxy-report questionnaires did not (Puente et al., 2014).

While performance-based IADL assessments have shown impairments among individuals with MCI, to our knowledge, IADL function using performance-based assessments has not been examined in the preclinical stage of AD. The purpose of this study was to assess whether (1) a performance-based measure of IADL provides a wider distribution of function compared to an IADL questionnaire among cognitively normal (CN) older adults with and without preclinical AD, and (2) IADL performance is associated with biomarkers of AD in the preclinical stage.

Methods

Participants and Study Design

This study is a cross-sectional examination of first-year data from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study, further details of which have been published previously (Bollinger et al., 2021). Briefly, community-dwelling participants in longitudinal studies at an Alzheimer Disease Research Center were invited to participate in the cohort study if they: (1) were aged 65 years or older, (2) were cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating® [CDR; Morris, 1993] of 0), and (3) underwent amyloid PET or structural MRI within two years of enrollment and/or functional MRI within three years of enrollment. All participants provided informed consent, and the Institutional Review Board at Washington University in St. Louis approved this study.

Measures

Cognitive Function

CDR.

The CDR (Morris, 1993) is a reliable and valid measure to stage AD severity and is widely used in clinical and research settings (Morris, 1997). The CDR follows a standardized protocol that includes a semi-structured interview with the participant and a reliable informant (i.e., family member) to assess the level of cognitive function in six domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. It is administered by a CDR-trained and certified rater. CDR scores range from 0 (CN) to 3 (severe dementia).

Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

The MMSE is a reliable and valid assessment of cognitive function and is widely used to screen for dementia (Dick et al., 1984). It contains 26 items and assesses orientation, attention, recall, and language. It is scored on a scale of 0 to 30; a score of 23 or less indicates the presence of cognitive impairment (Dick et al., 1984).

Proxy-Report IADL Measure

Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ).

The FAQ is a commonly used IADL scale with high interrater reliability and construct validity (Pfeffer et al., 1982). The FAQ is administered to a reliable proxy, who rates the participant’s ability over the previous four weeks on 10 categories of IADL: (1) writing checks, paying bills, keeping financial records; (2) assembling tax or business records; (3) shopping alone; (4) playing a game of skill; (5) making coffee or tea; (6) preparing a balanced meal; (7) keeping track of current events; (8) attending to and understanding a television program, book, or magazine; (9) remembering appointments, family occasions, medications; and (10) traveling out of the neighborhood. Each category is rated on a 4-point scale: (0) normal, (1) has difficulty but does by self, (2) requires assistance, or (3) dependent. IADL categories that could not be rated were not scored; this could have been because either the participant never performed them or because the informant had insufficient information to provide a valid response.

Performance-Based IADL Measure

Performance Assessment of Self-Care Skills (PASS).

The PASS (Rogers et al., 2016) is a standardized, performance-based assessment administered by an occupational therapist (OT). It has high interrater reliability and high test-retest reliability (Holm &amp; Rogers, 2008). The PASS includes 26 tasks that may be administered and scored separately. It can be administered using a clinic version (with materials provided by the OT) or a home version (with the participant’s own items). In this study, the clinic version was used for standardization purposes. It was completed in the home of each participant. OT raters underwent a training process to reliably administer the PASS using materials provided by the developers. Training was considered complete once an interrater reliability of 0.80 or above was achieved. Refresher trainings were performed with each OT rater two times per year. A trained OT blinded to amyloid status administered three cognitively demanding IADL tasks to assess participants’ functional cognition: shopping, checkbook balancing, and medication management.

A script is used to provide instructions for PASS tasks. Scoring is based on observed performance and includes independence, adequacy, and safety. Independence is scored using a graded cueing approach provided by the OT. If the participant cannot continue the task independently or has made a mistake, the OT begins the graded cueing process, starting from the least amount of assistance, and progressing to more assistance as needed. Types of cues offered, from least to greatest amount of assistance, include verbal supportive, verbal nondirective, verbal directive, gesture, environmental rearrangement, demonstration, physical guidance, physical support, and total assist.

The type and number of cues required for each subtask were used to determine the independence score for that task. Independence scores ranged from 0 to 3, with 0 representing continuous high-assistance cues required or inability to complete the subtask and 3 representing no cues required to complete the subtask. Independence for all subtask scores were averaged to create an independence mean score for the task. The total number of cues required for the task was also recorded. Each PASS task was given a score for overall adequacy of performance on a scale of 0–3, with 0 representing unacceptable quality and consistent lack of precision and/or efficiency. and 3 representing optimal quality, precision, and economy of effort.

Biomarkers

Amyloid PET Acquisition and Processing.

PET imaging was obtained within two years of PASS administration using methods described elsewhere (Su et al., 2013; Su et al., 2015). Participants were injected with 12–15 mCI of [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) or 7.4–11.3 mCI of [18F]-Florbetapir (AV45). Dynamic scans were obtained. The post-injection time window for quantification was 30–60 minutes for PiB and 50–70 minutes for AV45. The PET Unified Pipeline (github.com/ysu001/PUP) was used for data processing. A region of interest (ROI) segmentation approach was employed using FreeSurfer 5.3 (Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Charlestown, Massachusetts, USA). A tissue mask was created based on ROI segmentation. Partial volume correction was applied (Su et al., 2019). A standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) was acquired for each ROI, using cerebellar gray matter as a region for reference. A summary value (mean cortical uptake ratio) of the partial-volume corrected SUVR was obtained from cortical regions impacted by AD (Mintun et al., 2006). Centiloids were used to coordinate measures from tracers PiB and AV45 (Su et al., 2016; Mishra et al., 2017).

Structural MRI Acquisition and Analysis.

MRI was obtained with a 3T Siemens scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using methods described elsewhere (Gordon et al., 2016). T1-weighted scans were obtained with 1-mm isotropic resolution. T2-weighted images were obtained for registration. Left and right hippocampal volumes were summed to obtain a total hippocampal volume. Total hippocampal volume was adjusted for intracranial volume using a linear regression (Jack et al., 1997; Ossenkoppele et al., 2015).

Functional MRI Acquisition and Analysis.

Rs-fc scans were acquired using 36 contiguous slices (roughly 4.0-mm isotropic voxels; Thomas et al., 2014). During these scans, individuals were told to focus on a small plus sign and stay awake. Rs-fc preprocessing methods have been documented elsewhere (Thomas et al., 2014; Brier et al., 2016; Brier et al., 2012). ROIs were designated using a seed-based method (Power et al., 2011). A 298 functional ROI matrix was sorted into 13 resting state networks (RSN): auditory, visual, memory, ventral attention, dorsal attention, salience, default mode, sensorimotor, sensorimotor-lateral, cingulo-opercular, subcortical, cerebellum, and frontoparietal networks (Rousset et al., 2008). Thirteen composite scores from each RSN were produced by deriving the average of the Pearson correlations among all ROIs within each network. These results were Fisher-Z transformed. Singular value decomposition was carried out on the 13 RSN composite scores to obtain a global rs-fc intranetwork signature (Wisch et al., 2019). To obtain this single summary signature score for each participant, the eigenvector of the first principal component was multiplied by each participant’s intranetwork connections (Smith et al., 2018). This global rs-fc intranetwork signature is a weighted union of the 13 intranetwork connections, with a higher score representing greater within-network connectivity (Goh, 2011).

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Distributions were inspected for normality. Nonparametric statistics were used for non-normally distributed data and for categorical variables. Parametric tests were used for normally distributed data (most demographic and biomarker data). Statistical tests were two-tailed; p &lt; .05 was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 28.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Figures were generated in R (R Core Team, 2018) with ggplot (Wickham, 2016).

Nonparametric Mann–Whitney U tests were used to compare PASS performance (independence mean scores) between individuals with and without preclinical AD defined using standard cutoffs for PET amyloid tracers (Mintun et al., 2006; Su et al., 2013; Su et al., 2019). For the remainder of analyses, amyloid accumulation, represented on a Centiloid scale, and markers of neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume, rs-fc signature) were used as continuous variables. Pearson partial correlations or point biserial partial correlations (or nonparametric equivalents) were used to determine whether a relationship existed between biomarkers of AD and PASS IADL performance, controlling for age and sex. All PASS adequacy scores fell into two categories (“optimal” and “acceptable”); we performed independent samples t tests to test for differences in biomarkers between the two groups.

Results

In total, 161 CN (CDR 0) older adults met our inclusion criteria. They were on average 75 years old, mostly White, highly educated, consisted of slightly more females, and scored highly on the MMSE (mean: 29.21 out of 30, standard deviation 1.06; Table 1). Of this cohort, 150 participants had a proxy complete the FAQ within two years of the PASS and biomarker assessments. Those with responses of “never did” or “unknown” were unable to be summed to create a total score. Of the 117 participants with all IADL ability responses within a scorable range (normal, has difficulty but does by self, requires assistance, dependent), 106 scored 0 on the total assessment, indicating they were independent for all 10 IADL. The full results for each IADL category of the FAQ are shown in Table 2. On the PASS, the total number of cues required for independence and adequacy for the shopping task ranged from 0–11; for checkbook balancing, 0–17; and for medication management, 0–7. Independence mean scores, adequacy scores, and number of participants who received less than 3.0 (independent), are shown in Table 2. Scores were high, with averages per item score ranging from 2.67–2.90 out of 3.00 (Table 2).

Biomarkers and PASS Performance

Within two years of completing the PASS, 156 participants had amyloid PET, and 161 participants had a structural MRI (hippocampal volume); within three years of completing the PASS, 66 participants had a functional MRI (rs-fc signature). Forty-nine individuals (30%) had preclinical AD (Table 1). PASS performance did not differ between individuals with and without preclinical AD (shopping U = 2710, p = .65; checkbook balancing U=2819, p = .35; medication management U = 2625, p = .90).

After controlling for age and sex, PASS performance was not associated with amyloid accumulation (shopping p = .98, checkbook balancing p = .07, medication management p = .19), but significant associations were found between PASS performance and neurodegenerative markers (hippocampal volume and rs-fc signature; Table 2). Worse performance in medication management (adequacy) was significantly associated with smaller hippocampal volumes (r = .30, p = .02). Worse performance in checkbook balancing (adequacy) was significantly associated with weaker rs-fc signature (r = .28, p = .03), and worse performance in checkbook balancing (independence) was associated, although not reaching significance, with weaker rs-fc signature (r = .26, p = .05; Figure 1). The shopping task (independence and adequacy) had trend-level associations with network connection strength in the expected direction but did not reach significance (Table 2).

There was a significant difference in hippocampal volume between participants who scored “acceptable” and “optimal” in adequacy for the medication management task (t(159) = −2.74, p = .01); lesser adequacy was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes. There was also a significant difference in rs-fc signature between participants who scored “acceptable” and “optimal” in adequacy for the checkbook balancing task (t(65) =−2.39, p = .02); lesser adequacy was associated with weaker network connections (Figure 1).

Discussion

This study examined IADL performance among CN older adults with and without preclinical AD. We found that the FAQ, an IADL questionnaire, indicated no impairment and very little variability in scores among this population. We found that the PASS, a performance-based IADL assessment, demonstrated a wider distribution in function. Worse IADL performance on the PASS was not associated with amount of amyloid accumulation but was associated with markers of neurodegeneration, including smaller hippocampal volumes and reduced brain network connections.

The FAQ is administered to a proxy who can assess an individual’s level of function. This requires an additional person’s time for appointments and/or to complete questionnaires and is limited to the experience and perspective of this proxy. Even if a questionnaire uses a self-report method, results could be biased or inaccurate. Older adults may lack insight into changes or abilities, or they may be reluctant to acknowledge impairment as this may be perceived as a threat to independence. Further, the response scale options offer little room to identify subtle impairments. As we expected and in agreement with previous literature (Puente et al., 2014), the FAQ revealed that this cohort of CN older adults with and without preclinical AD had no IADL impairment.

The PASS, a standardized, performance-based IADL assessment, is a promising assessment to understand and detect impairment in function among CN individuals who may be at risk for cognitive impairment. The participant completes the assessment with a trained OT; no proxy is needed to acquire results. The PASS is observation-based, and all task materials are provided. A score is obtained for each task, which decreases bias and improves accuracy of assessing underlying functional cognition, unlike the FAQ, which contains the response options “unknown” or “never did” for each IADL task. The PASS also has multiple scoring scales of performance (independence and adequacy; some PASS tasks may also be scored for safety), rather than the single scale on the FAQ.

Our findings confirmed greater variability in PASS scores compared to FAQ scores (Table 2) among CN older adults. Examining the number of individuals who received the highest possible score for each FAQ task and those who received the highest possible score for each PASS task captures this distinction (Table 2). For example, the number of individuals who scored below the highest score (indicating impairment) for each FAQ item ranged from 1–4 individuals (1%–2%) compared to 35–110 individuals (22%–68%) for each PASS item.

We found that PASS performance was not associated with amyloid accumulation, but worse performance on two PASS tasks (checkbook balancing and medication management) was associated with decreased hippocampal volume and reduced rs-fc network connections (Table 3, Figure 1). This suggests that impairment in IADL performance may be associated with neurodegeneration. This may be due to identification of an impairment that exists in very late stages of preclinical AD or due to other vascular causes of neurodegeneration.

Our findings expand on previous literature that found impaired IADL performance among individuals with MCI compared to CN adults (Ciro et al., 2015; Rodakowski et al., 2014) and suggest that this subtle functional impairment may also be observed in the preclinical stage of AD.

Limitations

These results should be interpreted with caution. Few participants had tau, a biomarker that accumulates after amyloid and prior to neurodegenerative changes, measured within a period suitable for analysis with PASS performance, so it was not included in our analyses. This limited our ability to compare associations between PASS performance and all stages of preclinical AD. The associations found between neurodegeneration and PASS performance could be explained by factors other than preclinical AD, but we did not examine other potential causes in this study. There was a smaller sample size of those with rs-fc MRI, limited by the number of participants who had functional imaging within an appropriate period to analyze with PASS performance. Our cohort is high-functioning, and thus overall performance on the PASS, even though it provided a wider distribution of scores compared to the FAQ, was very high. Other performance-based IADL assessments may be more sensitive among CN older adults. Many of the current participants are White and well-educated, so these findings cannot be generalized to all populations. Longitudinal research with a larger cohort is planned.

Implications for Practice and Future Research

These findings have important implications for occupational therapy and the role of performance-based assessments in identifying older adults at risk for progressive cognitive impairment. Performance-based assessments may capture subtle functional impairments in IADL earlier than self- or proxy-report questionnaires that are more commonly used in geriatric clinical practice. OTs are uniquely qualified to fill this gap and administer performance-based assessments as a noninvasive screening for neurodegeneration, indicating risk of MCI/AD, prior to the onset of noticeable cognitive impairment.

Future research should investigate functional manifestations during preclinical AD to better identify individuals at risk for developing symptomatic AD. A better understanding of early functional changes should also be used in the development of tailored occupational therapy interventions to maintain function in daily living for individuals with progressive cognitive decline.

Conclusions

Impairment in functional cognition, assessed through IADL performance, was associated with markers of neurodegeneration among CN older adults. This impairment was not detectable through proxy-report questionnaires. Performance-based IADL assessments may be used by OTs in geriatric practice to detect functional impairment among older adults and identify individuals who may be at risk for MCI/AD prior to the onset of substantial cognitive impairment.
