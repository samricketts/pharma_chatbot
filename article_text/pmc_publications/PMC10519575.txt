pmcAggregation of misfolded brain proteins is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases with the types of proteins, morphology, and spatial distribution often forming the defining pathological features for a given disease. Over the past two decades, considerable progress has been made towards developing positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging radioligands (i.e., radiotracers) targeting beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles, the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. PET imaging of Aβ and tau aggregates provides in vivo quantification of the density of underlying protein aggregates throughout the entire three-dimensional volume of the brain. To-date, amyloid and tau PET imaging have been widely adopted to study the effects of Aβ and tau proteins on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, including use in clinical trials as inclusion/exclusion criteria, confirmation of target engagement, and as secondary trial endpoints. The interpretation of in vivo Aβ and tau PET imaging is highly informed by in vitro studies that characterize several aspects of PET tracers including binding affinity and selectivity of the radioligands to their designed molecular targets (see Mathis, et al., for review1).

Developing sensitive and selective PET tracers for tau protein aggregates is complicated by the six tau isoforms expressed in humans and the many ultrastructures and spatial deposition patterns that arise in different tauopathies (see Goedert, et al.2). The majority of tau PET imaging research has focused on developing tau PET ligands selective for AD-type neurofibrillary tangles comprised of 3R/4R paired-helical filaments, but recent studies have begun to explore the use of tau PET tracers to detect tau aggregates in non-AD tauopathies such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) with mixed results for some tracers. In a recent work by Malarte, et al.,(need citation information) researchers compare the binding profiles of three promising tau PET tracers (PI-2620, MK-6240, and RO-948) using in vitro binding assays, autoradiography, and immunohistochemistry to ascertain the extent to which these tracers might bind to tau aggregates present in CBD and PSP in addition to AD. Their results move the field forward in understanding the limitations of current generation tau tracers for non-AD tauopathies and provide valuable insights to consider when developing tau PET tracers for non-AD tauopathies.

Through a series of well-designed experiments, Malarte, et al. demonstrate that PI-2620, MK-6240, and RO-948 all have multiple high-affinity binding sites in AD tissue with similar relative affinities (1/KD) and relative receptor densities (Bmax) between the binding sites and similar spatial binding profiles. In addition, the authors also observed a high-affinity binding site in PSP for PI-2620. While PI-2620 had high affinity binding sites in AD, PSP and CBD, receptor density was highest in AD followed by PSP then CBD. When comparing autoradiographic findings between each tracer in CBD and PSP, PI-2620 had considerably higher displaceable binding compared to MK-6240 and RO-948 with some focal specific binding corresponding to tufted astrocytes and astrocytic plaques, hallmarks of PSP and CBD, respectively. Taken together, these findings have implications for in vivo tau PET imaging in AD and non-AD tauopathies.

What does it take to develop a selective 4R tau PET tracer?

The ability of a PET tracer to detect and quantify a molecular target in vivo is dependent on several factors including non-specific tracer binding, the affinity of the tracer to the target, and the density of the target receptors. In addition, selectivity of the tracer to one molecular target over another is determined by the relative affinities of the tracer to the different molecular targets and the relative receptor densities of the targets (i.e., binding potential = affinity x Bmax3). In agreement with previous work,4 Malarte, et al., show that PI-26205 has similarly high affinity for tau aggregates present in AD, PSP and CBD, but additionally show that the density of binding sites is considerably higher for AD compared to both PSP and CBD cases with PSP being higher than CBD. This suggests that while PI-2620 can bind to AD and PSP tau aggregates with high affinity, the resultant PET signal will be markedly higher for AD-type tau aggregates compared to PSP or CBD. This observation is cohesive with a recent in vivo study wherein in vivo distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were higher for AD compare to PSP and DVR was only slightly higher for PSP compared to controls in some brain regions.4 As such, developing tau PET tracers selective for non-AD tau aggregates over AD tau will likely require considerably higher affinity for these aggregates to overcome the lower target density. These results combined with previous work indicate PI-2620 will likely be valuable for developing more selective 4R tau tracers in the future.

Complexities of tau aggregates create challenges and opportunities for tau tracer selectivity

This work adds to a growing body of literature that demonstrates the complexity of different tau aggregates and the important differences between them that have consequences for PET tracer binding and selectivity. Recent works characterizing the molecular structure of various tau fibrils6 coupled with in silico research7 demonstrate how differences in tau aggregate structures affect access to PET ligand binding sites that are cohesive with results from in vitro studies.8 Exploiting these differences in binding site access are likely to play a critical role in developing tau PET tracers that are more selective to one tau aggregate over another. In addition to molecular differences, several tauopathies also have differences but also some overlap of spatial deposition patterns.9 Therefore, tracers such as PI-2620 that bind to both AD and non-AD tau aggregates might still be useful in discriminating AD from PSP tau aggregates to the extent that these aggregates do not overlap in key brain regions. This may provide a means to study the effects of 4R tauopathies in neurodegenerative disease until more selective tau PET tracers are realized.

Conclusions and future directions

Tau PET imaging has seen great advances over the past decade in developing tracers that enable in vivo quantitative assessment of tau deposition. The majority of existing tau PET tracers have been developed with Alzheimer’s disease tau aggregates as a focal point, but recent developments suggest that some tau PET tracers also bind to non-AD tauopathies such as PSP. Further optimization of tau PET ligands for non-AD tauopathies is needed to improve the detection sensitivity and the selectivity of these tracers to non-AD tauopathies over AD. The work by Malarte, et al. highlighted here shows how in-depth in vitro characterization and careful comparisons of tau PET ligands across multiple tauopathies is needed to elucidate the complex interactions between tau protein aggregates and candidate tau PET radioligands that give rise to in vivo binding and quantification characteristics. These types of studies coupled with antemortem-postmortem comparisons will undoubtedly drive the field forward in developing optimized tau PET tracers selective for different tauopathies.
