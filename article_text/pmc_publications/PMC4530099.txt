An important early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the aberrant polymerization and extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). In young transgenic mice expressing the human Aβ-precursor protein (APP), deposits of Aβ can be induced by the inoculation of minute amounts of brain extract containing Aβ aggregates (“Aβ seeds”), indicative of a prion-like seeding phenomenon. Moreover, focal intracerebral injection of Aβ seeds can induce deposits not only in the immediate vicinity of the injection site, but, with time, also in distal regions of the brain. However, it remains uncertain whether the spatial progression of Aβ deposits occurs via nonsystematic diffusion from the injection site to proximal regions or via directed transit along neuroanatomical pathways. To address this question, we analyzed the spatiotemporal emergence of Aβ deposits in two different APP-transgenic mouse models that had been previously inoculated with Aβ seeds into the hippocampal formation. The results revealed a specific, neuroanatomically constrained pattern of induced Aβ deposits in structures corresponding to the limbic connectome, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal pathways act as conduits for the movement of proteopathic agents among brain regions, thereby facilitating the progression of disease.

INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-associated neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction and the accumulation of extracellular, aggregated Aβ-peptide (Aβ) deposits (senile plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain (32). The aggregation of Aβ is considered an essential early trigger in AD pathogenesis that leads to neurofibrillary (tau) tangles, neuronal dysfunction, and dementia (30, 32). There is now general agreement that these lesions can be initiated by the prion-like seeding of protein aggregation (31, 36, 37, 54). However, the means by which plaques and tangles advance through the brain remains an important open question, as the mechanisms involved in the propagation of protein aggregates present potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Neuroanatomically delimited patterns of lesion distribution have suggested that neuronal pathways contribute to the systematic spread of plaques and tangles from region to region (5, 9–11, 33, 58, 60, 68, 69). Recently, in vivo imaging has provided further support for the general involvement of the connectome in AD-associated neurodegenerative changes (7, 34, 35, 53, 55, 61, 74). However, the time and site of origin of the initial Aβ seeds in AD remain unknown, and are likely to vary from person to person. This uncertainty can be minimized by experimental investigations of animal models in which the original pathogenic event - the introduction of proteinaceous seeds - is precisely defined spatially and temporally (37). In this proteopathic seeding paradigm, Aβ deposits are induced to form in young APP transgenic (tg) mice by the intracerebral or peripheral infusion of small amounts of brain extracts containing prion-like Aβ aggregates (19, 21, 29, 39, 48, 50, 62, 73). Similarly, exogenous seeds consisting of misfolded tau protein induce tauopathy that propagates from the site of injection to interconnected regions in the murine brain (3, 15, 16). This process also can be instigated by the transgenic expression of mutant, human tau in a restricted area of the brain (17, 45).

Despite strong evidence that abnormalities of Aβ drive neurofibrillary pathology and neurodegeneration in AD (14, 30, 32, 52), experimental evidence for the systematic spread of Aβ deposits in vivo remains limited. Our earlier studies have found that the focal injection of Aβ extract into the hippocampus can selectively induce deposits in the entorhinal cortex, and vice versa (20, 71). In light of the strong bidirectional connectivity of these two structures, these experiments provided that first clue that, once initiated by focal seeding, Aβ deposition can propagate non-randomly to other parts of the brain (36). In addition, a recent report found evidence that Aβ pathology spreads systematically among interconnected brain regions in (unseeded) transgenic mice expressing human APP with the AD-related ‘Arctic’ mutation (59). However, it is not clear whether the pattern of Aβ deposition is due to the spread of Aβ seeds or to (e.g.) spatiotemporal differences in genetic control of Aβ deposition. Moreover, if neuronal pathways are involved in spread, it is important to determine whether the amplification of lesions continues beyond the defined first-order connections of the seeding site to subsequently afflict more distant regions.

Using the in vivo seeding model to precisely define the time and place of the initial seeded pathology, we now demonstrate that cerebral β-amyloidosis is progressively induced in interconnected brain regions by the one-time intrahippocampal injection of Aβ-containing brain extract. We found that the pattern of spread closely mirrors the neuroanatomic features of the limbic connectome. These findings implicate neuronal pathways in the amplification of Aβ pathology within the brain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

We analyzed two transgenic mouse models in this investigation: R1.40 mice (40) and APP23 mice (63). Our previous studies found that Aβ seeding is effective in both male and female APP-transgenic mice, but because endogenous deposits appear earlier in female APP-transgenic mice (12, 64), we investigated male mice in these experiments to maximize the seeding time-window, and to minimize variability.

The R1.40 mice in the present study had been part of an earlier investigation of the long-term effects of Aβ seeding (29). Briefly, hemizygous R1.40 mice on a B6.129 background were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and then bred with C57BL/6J mice. R1.40 mice carry a yeast artificial chromosome containing a genomic copy of human APP harboring the K670N-M671L mutation, driven by the endogenous APP promoter. Homozygous R1.40 mice were generated by cross-breeding the offspring of hemizygous R1.40 mice. Homozygous mice begin to exhibit Aβ deposits only in late adulthood, around the age of 15 months. Because of the relatively late onset of endogenous lesion formation in this model, seeded Aβ deposits can be easily distinguished from endogenous lesions, allowing a more detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of the deposits.

In the APP23 mice, expression of transgenic APP (K670N-M671L mutation) is driven by a neuronal Thy-1-minigene promoter, and is confined to the nervous system (63). The mice had been backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice for more than 20 generations. In the absence of exogenous seeding, male APP23 mice currently bred at the Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research first develop individual β-amyloid plaques in the neocortex at 7 months and in the hippocampus at 9–10 months of age (41). All mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. Experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the veterinary office regulations of Baden-Württemberg (Germany) and approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee.

Preparation of Aβ-rich brain extracts

Brain tissues from aged APP tg mice or wild-type (non-transgenic) control mice were homogenized at 10% (w/v) in sterile PBS at 4°C using either an Ultra Turrax homogenizer followed by sonication (3×5s) as described previously (29), or using a Precellys 24-Dual homogenizer (Bertin, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France), 2×10 seconds at 5,500 rpm with each round separated by a 10 second pause (23). Homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000×g for 5 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were aliquoted and immediately frozen until thawing for stereotaxic injection, or further diluted to 1:10 in PBS before aliquoting and freezing.

Stereotaxic injection of brain extracts

The stereotaxic injections into R1.40 mice were conducted as previously described (29). In brief, 3–4 month-old R.1.40 mice were infused with 2.5 μl of Aβ-rich or control brain extract bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus (AP −2.5mm, L ±2.0mm, DV −1.8mm) over a 2-minute period, and with an additional 1 μl of brain extract into the overlying neocortex (AP −2.5mm, L ±2.0mm, DV −1.0mm). The animals were kept either for 6 months or 12 months post-injection.

In the second cohort of animals, 3–4 month-old APP23 mice were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight), and 2.5 μl of Aβ-rich brain extract (undiluted or diluted 1:10) or control brain extract was unilaterally (to determine the acute distribution of the injectate) or bilaterally injected over a 2-minute period into the dorsal hippocampus (AP −2.5mm, L ±2.0mm, DV −1.8mm). The needle was kept in place for an additional 2 minutes before being slowly withdrawn, without additional injection into the neocortex. The surgical area was cleaned with sterile saline, the incision was sutured, and the mice were kept under infrared light for warmth and monitored until recovery from anesthesia. The animals then survived for an incubation period of 1 day, 4 months or 6 months before being sacrificed by transcardial perfusion with PBS under deep anesthesia (ketamine 400 mg/kg, xylazine 40 mg/kg).

Histology

The brains were harvested and immersion-fixed for 48h in 4% de-polymerized paraformaldehyde in PBS, after which they were either cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS and frozen, or embedded in paraffin. Frozen brains were serially cut into 25-μm-thick coronal sections using a freezing-sliding microtome. The sections were collected in cryoprotectant (35% ethylene glycol, 25% glycerol in PBS) for storage at −20°C. Paraffin-embedded brains were serially cut into 5 μm-thick coronal sections to visualize the injectate. To expose antigenic sites, paraffin sections underwent enhanced antigen retrieval prior to immunostaining (38). The sections were stained immunohistochemically according to previously published protocols (21). Polyclonal antibody CN3 (21) was used for immunodetection of Aβ. Sections from APP23 mice were then either co-stained with Congo red or counterstained with nuclear fast red.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis of Aβ deposits

Aβ immunostaining (“Aβ load”) was assessed on a CN3/Congo red-stained set of every 12th coronal section throughout the brain. For qualitative analysis, a rating of “negative”, “mild”, “moderate”, “severe”, or “extreme” was assigned to the immunostaining in a given region. For quantitative analysis of Aβ load in the septum verum, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex, stereology-based assessment of the fractional area occupied by Aβ immunostaining was performed using a microscope equipped with a motorized x-y-z stage coupled to a video-microscopy system and the Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT, USA), as previously described (8). The researchers who performed the analysis were blind to the inoculation groups. The degree of parenchymal Aβ deposition was determined by calculating the area occupied by parenchymal CN3 or Congo red-positive staining in two-dimensional sectors (20×[0.45NA] objective), relative to the total area of each structure. The Aβ load was then expressed as the percent area occupied by CN3 immunoreactivity or Congo red birefringence.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

R1.40 mice

In R1.40 mice, endogenous Aβ deposition normally begins at approximately 15 months of age (29). Seeding with Aβ-rich brain extract accelerated this process, such that induced Aβ plaques were present in several brain areas at the age of 9–10 months, i.e., after 6 months of incubation. By this timepoint, conspicuous parenchymal Aβ deposition had emerged in the hippocampus, the indusium griseum, and in a linear band at the junction of layer I and layer II of the retrosplenial area of the cingulate cortex (Fig. 1). In other regions of the neocortex, Aβ deposits were observed only in the entorhinal cortex and in the vicinity of the injection site dorsal to the anterior hippocampus. Diffuse Aβ staining also was apparent in the fimbria, thalamus and septum verum (Fig. 1A and 1B).

After 12 months of incubation, when the R1.40 mice were 15–16 months old and normally just beginning to manifest endogenous deposits (29), profuse parenchymal Aβ deposition was present in the hippocampus, indusium griseum, olfactory bulb, retrosplenial cortex, and also in a number of other neocortical regions, including the entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex and visual cortex. Mostly diffuse Aβ deposits also were present in the septum verum and, to a lesser extent, in the thalamus, nucleus accumbens and mammillary bodies. In addition to the parenchymal deposits, some cerebral β-amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was present in meningeal vessels and within various brain structures, including the neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus (Fig. 1A and 1C).

APP23 mice

To confirm the findings in R1.40 mice, we investigated the spatiotemporal spread of lesions in seeded APP23 mice. In this experiment, we injected Aβ extracts only into the hippocampus in order to mitigate the potential contribution of neocortically infused seeds to the pattern of Aβ deposition. Because endogenous Aβ deposits appear earlier in APP23 mice than in R1.40 mice, it was necessary to shorten the incubation periods. Additionally, in a subgroup of APP23 mice we analyzed the brain one day after the injection to assess the acute distributional pattern of the injectate. At this time, after enhanced antigen retrieval, the injectate could be detected as small, punctate material that was restricted to the vicinity of the infusion (Fig. 2A and 2B).

Four months following injection of Aβ-rich brain extract into the hippocampus of APP23 mice, significant parenchymal Aβ deposition was present in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Diffuse Aβ staining was apparent in the fimbria, and Aβ deposition had begun to emerge in the indusium griseum and retrosplenial area of the cingulate cortex. Only sparse Aβ plaques were observed in the frontal cortex and olfactory bulb. In addition, substantial CAA was present in the thalamus at this timepoint (Fig. 2A and 2C).

After six months of incubation, the localization of seeded, parenchymal Aβ lesions in APP23 mice was remarkably similar to that of R1.40 mice at 12 months post-injection (Fig. 2). Aβ plaques were predominantly located in the hippocampal formation and in the entorhinal cortex, and some of these were dense, congophilic deposits. Intense parenchymal Aβ immunostaining - mostly non-congophilic - also was observed in the indusium griseum and the retrosplenial cingulate cortex. Numerous diffuse deposits and occasional dense-core plaques (although fewer than in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex) were present in the olfactory bulb and in many areas of the neocortex, including frontal cortex, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex and visual cortex. Weaker, diffuse Aβ immunostaining was present in the septum verum, fimbria, nucleus accumbens and mammillary bodies (Fig. 2A and 2D). In mice that had received an injection of dilute (1%) brain extract into the hippocampus, the ensuing plaque formation was correspondingly reduced in interconnected brain regions (Fig. 3), indicating that the distributional pattern of deposits was linked to the initial seed, and was unlikely to result from a seed-independent (endogenous) process.

One salient difference between seeded APP23 mice and R1.40 mice was the appearance of heavy CAA, in the absence of significant parenchymal Aβ, in the thalamus of APP23 mice. CAA also was prominent in meningeal vessels of these mice, and it accompanied, to varying degrees, the parenchymal Aβ deposits in other brain regions as well (Fig. 2C).

In agreement with previous studies (48), no seeded Aβ deposits occurred after injection of wild-type mouse brain extract, which lacks aggregated Aβ (data not shown). Notably, similar brain regions developed parenchymal Aβ deposits in seeded APP23 mice (which received only hippocampal injections) and in seeded R1.40 mice (which received a small, additional infusion of seeding extract in the overlying neocortex), despite significant differences in the transgenetic systems in the two models. In the APP23 mice, we did not actively inject extract into the neocortex, but we cannot exclude the possibility that a small quantity of seeds leaked into the neocortex along the injection track. In both models, however, the predominant neuroanatomic pattern of emergent lesions closely followed the connectivity of the limbic system (Fig. 4).

The principal structures manifesting Aβ deposits following the placement of seeds in the hippocampus were additional components of the classical Papez circuit, i.e., the entorhinal cortex, anterior thalamus, and mammillary bodies (46). The spatiotemporal pattern of Aβ immunoreactivity is consistent with the primary seeding event being confined largely to the injected hippocampus, followed by the further involvement of axonally connected regions. The apparently limited spread of the initial (injected) seeds after one day, and the extended lag period that precedes the emergence of seeded lesions, may argue that subsequent seeding events are mediated downstream of the primary inductive event by endogenously generated seeds (20). However, the possibility that the exogenous seeds are transported/diffuse to other brain regions cannot be excluded.

Our hypothesis for the neuroanatomical spread of Aβ lesions within the limbic connectome is schematically illustrated in Figure 4. The early appearance of distinct Aβ-immunoreactivity in the entorhinal cortex of hippocampally seeded mice underscores the strong axonal interconnections between this region of cortex and the hippocampus (6, 66, 70). Other components of the limbic connectome that were preferentially beset by Aβ deposition include the mammillary bodies (which are connected via the fimbria-fornix to the hippocampus) (2, 46), the anterior thalamus (2, 46, 67), and the retrosplenial cingulate cortex (49, 65). In addition, axons originating in the hippocampus project to the frontal cortex and olfactory bulb via the precommissural fornix, which traverses the septum (2, 13), and to septal nuclei (4). Neurons of the hippocampus also project to the nucleus accumbens, a central component of the limbic system (6, 25, 26), and also to other cortical regions, including motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, auditory cortex and visual cortex (6).

Although Aβ deposits were preferentially localized within the limbic connectome, the type of deposits differed among regions. Regarding the parenchymal lesions, some regions had more congophilic plaques while other regions had more diffuse plaques. Since dense, congophilic plaques are thought to be relatively mature lesions that can evolve from diffuse deposits (68), congophilic plaques could denote the regions that are affected earliest in the proteopathic cascade. However, there is no conclusive evidence that this sequence of events is an obligatory feature of the evolution of plaques; indeed, it seems probable that the type of Aβ deposits and the time of their emergence are governed by the local conditions within each brain region. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal correlation between parenchymal and vascular amyloid in the seeded mice is imperfect, suggesting that these two types of lesion arise in different ways.

An intriguing finding in the seeded R1.40 and APP23 mice is the heavy Aβ accumulation in the indusium griseum, a thin supracallosal strip of grey matter thought to be a rudimentary extension of the hippocampal formation (1, 42, 44, 57). Interestingly, the indusium griseum also contains Aβ deposits in unseeded, aged APP23 mice (unpublished observations). The prominent appearance of immunoreactive Aβ in the indusium griseum of mice contrasts with the paucity of both Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the indusium griseum of AD patients (43, 44). It is possible that the discrepancy in Aβ load between humans and mice reflects species differences in the composition and/or connectivity of this structure, or perhaps is due to the transgene expression in genetically modified mice.

The highly specific distribution of Aβ within the limbic connectome, and the paucity of deposits in proximal but hodologically discrete structures, supports the hypothesis that a pathogenic agent is conveyed selectively along neuronal pathways, either by directed diffusion or by means of axonal transport. Cell culture studies have shown that oligomeric Aβ can be transferred directly from neuron to neuron (18, 51). However, because many brain regions are bi-directionally connected, whether retrograde or anterograde transport (or both) is involved in vivo remains unknown, as does the relative importance of different neuron types in the trafficking of a proteopathic agent. Burgeoning evidence, however, substantiates the involvement of neuronal transport mechanisms in the progression of neurodegenerative disease (5, 7, 9, 10, 33, 34, 53, 55, 58, 60, 61, 68, 69, 74).

Our study, using a model in which the placement of the initial seeds is spatiotemporally well-defined, complements a previous analysis of the pattern of lesion emergence in transgenic mice (TgAPParc) that overexpress human APP with the ‘arctic‘ mutation (E693G) (59). By 4 months of age, intracellular Aβ in TgAPParc mice is accompanied by diffuse, extracellular deposits in the subiculum, alveus, and the retrosplenial granular cortex. By 9 months of age, diffuse Aβ has accumulated in the thalamus, mammillary bodies, fimbria, fornix, motor cortex and somatosensory cortex. At 12–15 months of age, diffuse Aβ also is present in the entorhinal cortex, piriform cortex, lateral septum, and pons/medulla. In this model, as in ours, the progression of Aβ neuropathology corresponds, at least in part, to the territory of the Papez circuit (59). Although the site(s) at which the Aβ seeds originate cannot be defined with certainty in the TgAPParc model, both our findings and those of Rönnbäck et al. (59) indicate that the progression of plaque pathology in the brain follows a systematic course from points of initiation to downstream, axonally connected targets. This conclusion is supported by the demonstration in TgAPParc mice that chemical lesion of the dorsal subiculum mitigates Aβ deposition in axonally connected structures (24). Other potentially pathogenic proteins such as tau, which misfolds and aggregates into intracellular tangles, and α-synuclein, which forms cytoplasmic inclusions in Parkinson’s disease, also have been shown to propagate systematically among synaptically connected brain regions (3, 15–17, 45, 47, 56, 72). These studies collectively highlight the emerging concept that, in a wealth of neurodegenerative diseases, prion-like molecular events drive the proliferation of pathogenic seeds, and cellular transport mechanisms expedite their spread within the nervous system (27, 28, 36, 37, 72).
