Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by numerous sexual dimorphisms that impact the development, progression, and likely the strategies to prevent and treat the most common form of dementia. In this review, we consider this topic from a female perspective with a specific focus on how women’s vulnerability to the disease is affected by the individual and interactive effects of estrogens and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Importantly, APOE appears to modulate systemic and neural outcomes of both menopause and estrogen-based hormone therapy. In the brain, dementia risk is greater in APOE4 carriers, and the impacts of hormone therapy on cognitive decline and dementia risk vary according to both outcome measure and APOE genotype. Beyond the CNS, estrogen and APOE genotype affect vulnerability to menopause-associated bone loss, dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease risk. An emerging concept that may link these relationships is the possibility that the effects of APOE in women interact with estrogen status by mechanisms that may include modulation of estrogen responsiveness. This review highlights the need to consider the key AD risk factors of advancing age in a sex-specific manner to optimize development of therapeutic approaches for AD, a view aligned with the principle of personalized medicine.

pmcScope

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the primary cause of dementia. Of AD patients, 98% are over 65 years old (sporadic or late onset AD) while ~2% of patients are younger with early onset AD (EOAD) (1, 2). Underlying mechanisms that cause sporadic AD, the universal biological variables of AD risk, specifically age, APOE genotype, and sex, account for the majority of disease risk. While age is the greatest risk factor for AD, APOE4 is the predominant genetic risk factor, increasing risk up to 15-fold compared to the common APOE3 (3, 4). Sex plays a significant role in AD risk, with females showing higher prevalence and lifetime risk compared to males (5) and female APOE4 carriers have the highest risk (6, 7) (Fig. 1). The contributions of each of the universal biological variables to AD have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (8-11). As well, the basic characteristics that define the synergistic effects of APOE4 and female sex that increase AD risk have also been covered in other reviews (12, 13). In this review, we explore the possible causes of AD vulnerability in females (Fig. 2A), revisit the interactions of estrogen, APOE and AD risk (Fig. 2B) and introduce topics that have been understudied or require further study (Fig. 2C). Understanding the relationships among sex, estrogens and APOE are essential not only to understanding differences between and within sexes but also in developing the specific strategies to treat or prevent AD that are the foundation of personalized medicine.

Female sex and AD vulnerability (Figure 2A)

Biological sex affects multiple aspects of AD ranging from disease vulnerability to its development and manifestation (11, 14, 15). The prevalence of AD shows a significant female bias, with women accounting for over 60% of AD cases in the US (16) and having higher lifetime risk for developing the disease (17). Evidence supports that greater longevity in women only partially accounts for the higher prevalence of AD in females (18-22). Incidence of AD is generally thought to be similar between men and women (19) though there is evidence that, after adjusting for age, incidence can be greater in women (23-29) including cases of EOAD (30). The disease also has several sexual dimorphisms, including reports that female sex is associated with increased severity of symptoms (15) and pathology (31, 32), faster cognitive decline (33-36), and stronger correlation between AD biomarkers and cognitive decline (37). Female AD risk is suggested to be established largely by fluctuations in hormone levels during two critical stages in life: perinatal development and menopause.

Sexual development

The sex of the brain is determined through the process of sexual differentiation in which both genetic sex and sex hormones play critical roles (38, 39). In general, the role of gonadal hormones in sexual differences is classified into two functional components: organizational and activation. The organizational component refers to sexual differentiation that largely occurs during pre- and perinatal critical periods in which gonadal hormones leads to specific, permanent changes in sexually dimorphic regions of the brain. The organizational process is primarily driven by transient elevations in testosterone that masculinize the brain (38-40), although there are broader sexual dimorphisms in the hypogonadal-pituitary-gonadal axis during developmental periods that are also important (41). The female brain develops in the absence of this testosterone surge by what is thought to be an active process in which genes associated with masculinization are repressed to maintain the female neural circuitry within sexually dimorphic regions (39, 42-45). While developmental organizational effects are permanent, the activational effects of sex hormones are not in that they depend upon the continued presence of hormones. Activation effects begin at puberty with elevation of testosterone in males and cyclic surges of estrogen with the ovarian cycle in females. These are transient hormonal effects on a fully developed nervous system which allow for refinement of sex-specific neuro-behavioral pathways (43).

There is recent evidence that women may be inherently more vulnerable to AD and related dementias due to early developmental process involved in sexual differentiation. Findings from human studies of both dizygotic twins (46) and finger length ratios (47), two approaches used to infer early life exposure to testosterone, suggest that women with a relatively more feminine in utero environment are at increased risk for dementia later in life (48, 49). In mice, perinatal feminization of males leads to an increase in β-amyloid (Aβ), a component of AD neuropathology, while perinatal masculinization of females leads to a reduction in Aβ accumulation (50). Collectively, these findings suggest that early feminization of the brain could increase AD vulnerability.

Menopause

The topic of AD with respect to estradiol (E2) loss that occurs as a result of ovarian depletion and cessation of the ovarian cycle has been reviewed extensively (14, 51-53). Although other hormones are affected by menopause and may contribute to AD vulnerability, including progesterone (54, 55) and gonadotropins (56), the primary focus of the field and the emphasis of this review is E2. There is abundant evidence that E2 induces numerous actions implicated in protecting against development and progression of AD (57, 58), thus the loss of activational effects of E2 in women may be expected to contribute to AD pathogenesis. In women, surgical menopause by way of oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries, the primary source of endogenous estrogens) performed prior to the age of natural menopause increases risks of cognitive decline and dementia (59-62). Brain levels of Aβ are elevated with depletion of circulating E2 resulting from oophorectomy (62) and natural menopause (63-65). In transgenic mouse models of AD, ovarian removal in young adulthood significantly accelerates the development of AD-like neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction (66-68). E2 loss disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis resulting in elevated circulating levels of the gonadotropins, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, which also may contribute to increased AD risk (56, 69).

Given the evidence that low E2 levels are associated with increased AD risk, estrogen-based hormone therapies (HT) have been suggested as a therapeutic approach to reduce AD vulnerability. Several early case-control and prospective studies reported reduced dementia risk in women who were current or former HT users (70-72). However, the placebo-controlled, double-blinded Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial conducted two decades ago found that dementia risk was increased rather than decreased in HT users (73, 74). Although the issue remains to be fully reconciled, a widely embraced position is that the period of female life during which estrogens are administered is crucial. Specifically, HT use at perimenopause is thought to be largely beneficial but diminishes over chronological and/or reproductive age such that HT use several years after the onset of menopause (the predominant pattern in WHI) can be harmful (75-85). This idea of a “window of opportunity” for successful HT use is supported by analyses that considered HT in the context of reproductive aging (86-92). An important concept that has emerged from this literature is E2 responsiveness. How the body’s responses to E2 are modified by aging, genetics, and other factors remain to be fully elucidated.

APOE and estrogen interactions on AD risk (Figure 2B)

APOE genotype is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD: APOE3 is the most common and is set as the reference point for AD risk; APOE2 is the least prevalent and is associated with decreased AD risk; APOE4 accounts for ~15% of APOE alleles in the US and increases AD risk from approximately 3- to &gt;10-fold for one and two alleles, respectively (10, 93). APOE4-associated AD risk impact females more strongly than males. For example, early studies reported that a single APOE4 copy yielded very modest effects on AD risk in males, yet significantly increased risk and lowered age of onset in females (6, 7). In a recent meta-analysis, the female bias in APOE4-associated AD risk was found to be influenced by age with a significant female bias limited to the ages of 65-75 years (94). Similarly, APOE4 females exhibit greater CSF AD biomarkers (95) and hippocampal volume loss (96), compared to males. Interestingly, women exhibit stronger negative consequences of APOE4 on brain structure and function prior to or in the absence of dementia (33, 97-100). Among people with mild cognitive impairment, females but not males displayed significant worsening in cognitive abilities with increasing numbers of APOE4 alleles (101). A parallel pattern of female-predominant APOE4-associated cognitive effects was also reported in adolescents, in which females exhibited lower Full Scale IQ and Performance IQ, compared to males (102). Additionally, APOE4 perimenopausal females exhibited a lower metabolic rate compared to APOE3 (63, 64, 103-105). APOE4 genotype is suggested to modulate these interactions to cooperatively promote AD pathogenesis (106). Transgenic mice with targeted replacement of mouse APOE with human APOE isoforms have yielded evidence that the combination of APOE4 genotype and female sex often exacerbated outcomes across numerous measures, including cognitive impairment (107, 108), Aβ accumulation (109, 110), gut microbiome dysbiosis (111), microglial-plaque interactions (112), and microglial transcriptomic profiles (113), although this is not always the case (114, 115). Collectively, human and rodent data suggest that many of the deleterious effects associated with APOE4 genotype are worsened in females, though the factors underlying this relationship have yet to be determined.

Menopause

As discussed above, female sex and APOE4 can combine to increase AD risk and cognitive loss (6, 7, 33, 94, 116-119). Despite these observations, clinical studies of the association between APOE4 and AD risk typically control for sex rather than studying interactions between sex and APOE genotype. Similarly, relatively few studies have examined whether neural effects of HT vary by APOE genotype, often simply adjusting data for APOE4 status. ApoE has been suggested to play an important role in the beneficial neural effects of E2 (120-122). ApoE is induced by exogenous E2 in glial cultures (120, 122-124) as well as in brains of macaques (125) and mice (123, 124, 126-128), an effect that is estrogen receptor (ER) dependent (129). Importantly, CNS apoE levels in mice are also modulated by the estrus cycle (127).

Whether and how age-related E2 depletion affects APOE4-associated AD risk in women remains to be fully elucidated. Interestingly, in a 3-year longitudinal study, APOE4 status was associated with increased Aβ load in frontal cortex during the menopause transition (63, 105) (Fig. 3). In mouse studies, there are mixed reports on how the effects of E2 loss on neural functions are modulated by APOE. For instance, ovarian failure chemically induced by 4-vinylcyclohexedene at 8 months (M) of age in combination with a high-fat diet was associated with cognitive decline and decreased synaptic plasticity, particularly in APOE4 mice (130). In contrast, ovariectomy (OVX) at 5M reduced synaptic density and long-term potentiation in APOE3 mice but increased synaptic activity, spine density and excitatory activity in APOE4 mice (131). In the EFAD mouse model (human APOE knock-in and overexpression of familial AD transgenes (132)), anxiety was greatest in female E4FAD mice compared to E3FAD mice; however, OVX increased anxiety in E3FAD mice comparable to intact and OVX E4FAD mice (114). These findings suggest that the interactive effects of E2 and APOE genotype on cognition may be dependent on age and the presence of AD pathology.

Hormone therapy

Studies that included APOE as an independent variable have been somewhat confusing as they have reported positive, null, and negative outcomes associated with HT (Table 2). In studies where HT yielded no neural benefits or mixed effects, APOE4 carrier status did not influence the measured outcomes (133-135). When HT exhibited clearer positive or negative effects, the impact of APOE4 genotype was mixed across studies. For example, HT was reported to be more beneficial for APOE4 carriers in increasing hippocampal volume (136) and odor threshold (137), as well as in decreasing Aβ deposition (138) and risks of AD (139) or dementia (140). In contrast, studies showing HT-related improvements in learning and memory (141), working memory (142), and depression symptoms (143) benefits were found only in APOE4 non-carriers. Notably, many studies reporting positive neural outcomes with HT do not find significant interactions with APOE (72, 144-149). When HT is associated with detrimental effects, APOE4 carrier status also yields mixed results. For example, APOE4 carriers exhibited a more favorable outcome when HT was associated with an increase in brain aging (150) or a decrease in processing speed (151). Conversely, APOE4 carriers showed increased negative effects of HT on verbal fluency (152) and working memory (153). In other studies, HT-associated increases in white matter hyperintensities (138) or decreases in working memory (151, 154) were not significantly affected by APOE4. A clearer pattern emerges in the complex relationship between HT and APOE when considering the subset of studies demonstrating a significant interaction between these two variables. APOE4 non-carriers appear to benefit most strongly from HT on cognitive measures such as learning, working memory and verbal fluency (141, 142, 152, 153) while AD-related outcomes including dementia risk and Aβ deposition favor APOE4 carriers (138-140) (Fig. 3).

Of importance, HT efficacy is thought to be affected by multiple variables, including the use of progestins (155-157), the type of estrogen (158-160), and timing of treatment relative to reproductive age (75). The KEEPS trial, which considered both progestins and reproductive aging in its design, found that APOE4 carrier status did not alter HT-related cognitive and neuroimaging outcomes (134, 135, 138, 144) except for Aβ deposition, which favored APOE4 carriers (138). In contrast, measures of brain aging positively correlated to circulating E2 levels in APOE4 carriers while it was negatively correlated with APOE4 non-carriers (150). Regarding the therapeutic window hypothesis, observational studies show that HT use after a diagnosis of AD is more beneficial in APOE4 non-carriers (143), suggesting that perhaps it is important to use HT earlier in APOE4 carriers (141, 142, 153). Likewise, the UK Biobank study that includes 16000+ mid-life women, demonstrates early age of HT initiation is associated with less brain aging exclusively for APOE4 carriers (150).

Estrogen receptors

The cognitive and AD-related outcomes modified by the interactions between HT and APOE may depend not only on HT variables, but also on the interactions among APOE and estrogen receptors (ERs). Prior work has described that polymorphisms and expression levels of ERs can be significantly affected by APOE genotype (114, 161-167), which in turn may modulate E2 responsiveness and thus contribute to observed differences in HT efficacy.

ApoE is the major lipoprotein component apolipoprotein that is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) (93, 168) and participates in neuronal function (169-171), thus its relative levels can contribute significantly to the lipid homeostasis in the brain and neural function. Since ERβ activation is associated with a decrease in apoE levels (129), it is hypothesized that HT effects on cognition could be blunted due to reduced levels of apoE in APOE4 carriers (120-122) as ERβ levels in human hippocampus and mice microglia are higher in APOE4 carriers (167, 172). Similarly, ERα levels are reported to be higher in AD (167) and with APOE4 in EFAD mice (114). Since ERα activation is associated with an increase in apoE levels (129), it is hypothesized that HT modulation of AD risk may involve increased apoE in APOE4 carriers (Fig. 3).

Estrogen and APOE interactions beyond CNS (Figure 2C)

APOE encodes the apolipoprotein apoE, an essential protein component of chylomicron remnants, very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) that play an important role in the lipoprotein uptake by the liver. The 3 common variants (APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4) differ by one amino acid residue at positions 112 or 158 of the total 299 residues. The three main APOE alleles are equally distributed in males and females (173, 174). The APOE2 allele is associated with greater longevity, while APOE4 is associated with increased frailty (175-178). APOE genotype is a major risk factor for several diseases, with specific risks impacted by sex (7). For example, it has been shown that APOE4 is associated with higher levels of LDL-cholesterol levels and correspondingly higher cardiovascular risk compared to APOE3 (173, 179, 180). Interestingly, the cardiovascular risk was found to be particularly higher in males (181, 182) and a protective effect of APOE2 was found only for females (183). Plasma and brain apoE levels differ by APOE genotype with APOE2 carriers exhibiting the greatest levels, while levels are lowest in APOE4 (184-188), differences that are pronounced in females (184). Within APOE3/4 individuals, the distribution of apoE4 vs. apoE3 differs by sex with apoE4 levels being higher in females (189). As discussed above, the clearest example of APOE4-induced risk influenced by sex is for late-onset AD (93) where APOE4 increases AD risk more strongly in women (6, 7, 10). These observations suggest that APOE and sex interactions are widespread and relevant to normal physiology and disease.

APOE and the female reproductive tract

Given the discussed relationships among AD risk, sex steroid hormones, APOE genotype and female sex, the possibility that APOE genotype modulates female reproductive tract functions warrants consideration. Evidence indicates a role of apoE in regulating ovarian functions including steroid production and possibly fertility (190). ApoE is expressed in several tissues of the female reproductive tract, including the ovaries (191). Early work in the field reported that the rat granulosa cells in culture secrete apoE in a manner that is increased by follicle stimulating hormone (192), an observation replicated in vivo at the level of APOE mRNA expression (193). The function of ovarian apoE has been hypothesized to involve uptake of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol that is necessary for steroidogenesis, particularly production of progesterone by theca cells and E2 by granulosa cells (190). Whether APOE genotype regulates this function is not well defined, but the possibility is hypothesized. For example, APOE knockout mice exhibit reduced circulating levels of progesterone and E2 (194). Further, luteal phase progesterone levels are reported to be significantly higher in human APOE4 carriers (195). Because relatively higher progesterone levels predict increased fertility, these data suggest the possibility that APOE genotype affects fertility. The data on fertility and APOE are mixed, with some reports of higher fertility in APOE3 versus APOE4 women (196, 197). Conversely, APOE4 is linked with significantly higher fertility in pre-industrial Ecuadorian cohorts (198) and in a rural Ghanian population exposed to high pathogen levels (199). These latter observations of APOE4 benefits in the contexts of challenging environmental conditions parallels reports of cognitive benefits in APOE4 carriers under high pathogen load in the indigenous Bolivian Tsimane population (200). Of note, it is still unknown the extent to which APOE genotype modulates these functions and whether such relationships influence the APOE and sex interactions on neural outcomes.

APOE, menopause and HT

As the menopause transition results in diminished activational effects of estrogens and often instigates HT use, both of which may affect AD development, the potential modulatory roles of APOE in menopause warrant consideration. There is not convincing evidence that APOE affects the age of menopause onset. For example, while He et al. found that a rare APOE polymorphism decreased the age of menopause onset, they did not observe a significant association with the more common variants (201). APOE2 has shown mixed association with menopause, with earlier age of onset reported in one study (202) but not in another (201). Similarly, APOE4-carriers were found to experience either earlier (203) or later (204) age of menopause compared to APOE4 non-carriers across different studies. Therefore, the link between APOE genotype and age of natural menopause onset is unclear and requires further investigation.

There is significant evidence that specific consequences of menopause and the associated efficacy of HT response can be modulated by APOE genotype. In particular, significant bone loss occurs at the onset of menopause and diminishes in later life with HT (205-208). Several large studies that included males and females did not find an association of APOE genotype with bone mineral density (BMD) (209-213). However, targeted studies of postmenopausal woman find APOE4 carriers have lower BMD (214-218) or higher hip fracture risk (219), although there have been null findings (220). A meta-analysis found APOE4 to be associated with significantly lower BMD in trochanteric and lumbar spine, predominantly in females (221). Further, Salamone et. al. report that APOE4 is associated with lower BMD in peri- and postmenopausal women but not in pre-menopausal women (217). Likewise, two studies find HT to be beneficial particularly among APOE4 carriers (217, 218). Collectively, available data support a modulatory role of APOE such that APOE4 appears to yield both greater vulnerability to and HT-mediated protection from menopause-related bone loss.

Early and natural menopause also are associated with obesity, peripheral dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance (222-224), cardiometabolic factors that substantially increase risk for AD (106). As discussed above, APOE4 is associated with increased plasma cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, compared to APOE3 (225). Further, APOE4 genotype is associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile during menopause (226-228) (Fig. 3). The peripheral dyslipidemia associated with menopause is significantly improved by HT with reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol as well as an increase in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (229); these effects may be modulated by the age of HT initiation (230-232). Upon stratifying data by APOE genotype, the protective effects of HT on peripheral lipids are stronger in APOE4 non-carriers (142, 233-236) (Table 1, Fig. 3). However, some studies find either APOE4 carriers more sensitive to HT protection (133, 237) or there is HT interaction with APOE (238, 239) (Table 1, Fig. 3).

Early and natural menopause are associated with insulin resistance and higher risks for development of T2D (240, 241). Interestingly, APOE4 is also linked to increased risks for T2D (242, 243), though little is known about how this relationship may be modified by E2 loss. In post-menopausal women, poor metabolic profile and cognitive decline are associated most strongly with APOE4 (244), and intensive lifestyle intervention on obese or overweight diabetic post-menopausal women was beneficial on cognitive outcomes only among APOE4 non-carriers (245). Collectively, available findings suggest interactions among menopause, HT, and APOE both in peripheral and neural tissues.

Conclusions

Female sex, APOE genotype, menopause-related E2 depletion, and HT are all implicated in modulating risks for cognitive impairment and AD. Each of these factors is known to interact to varying degrees with the others in both peripheral and neural tissues. However, despite numerous studies conducted over many years in both human populations and experimental animal models, the definition of these relationships and their interactive impact on AD risk remain incompletely defined. There are several limiting variables. In human studies, sex and APOE genotype are often controlled for rather than explicitly investigated. Modulating effects of HT are further complicated by differences in HT regimens and the initiation and length of intervention, all of which significantly affect outcomes. Perhaps not surprisingly, reported findings are highly mixed in terms of the effects of HT, APOE, and their interactions. Animal studies also have limitations. Most notably, chronological and reproductive aging are generally not well considered. The various strains of transgenic AD mice effectively model select aspects of the disease, including Aβ accumulation, but other key components of the human disease are not represented, such as onset of pathology in late-life. Inclusion of human APOE genotypes is an important strength of mouse models, such as the EFADs, but it is not considered in most transgenic models. Despite the numerous hurdles across investigational paradigms, new themes are emerging that may begin to explain inconsistencies and advance the field. One possibility is that APOE interacts with female sex in part by affecting E2 responsiveness. Continued investigation of these issues with increased attention to the importance of interactive relationships promises to improve the ability to prevent and treat AD and foster the use of precision medicine.

Figure 3. APOE genotype modulates the response of menopause and estrogen-based hormone therapy (HT) in brain and systemically. Menopause is associated with decreased cognition and increased dementia risk in brain, and elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk systemically. These detrimental effects of menopause are generally more pronounced in APOE4 carriers (APOE4+, red) than APOE4 non-carriers (APOE4−, blue). HT is typically associated with improved neural outcomes. Beneficial HT effects on cognition favor APOE4 non-carriers while AD-related outcomes favor APOE4 carriers. APOE4 carriers tend to exhibit greater increases in menopause-related dyslipidemia and CVD risk tend to while also showing lesser HT benefits.
