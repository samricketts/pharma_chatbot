Consideration of place of care is the first step in long-term care (LTC) planning and is critical for patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease; yet, drivers of consideration of place of care are unknown. We apply machine learning algorithms to cross-sectional data from the CARE IDEAS study (n=869 dyads) to identify drivers of patient consideration of institutional, in-home paid, and family care. While decisions about LTC are complex, important drivers included whether patients consulted with a financial planner about LTC, patient demographics, loneliness, and geographical proximity of family members. Findings about consulting with a financial planner match literature showing that perceived financial constraints limit the range of choices in LTC planning. Well-documented drivers of institutionalization, such as care-partner burden, were not identified as important variables. By understanding which factors drive patients to consider each type of care, clinicians can guide patients and their families in LTC planning.

Introduction

Long-Term Care Preferences

Institutionalization is costly, generally not preferred by patients, and may contribute to lower quality of life for older adults. However, among persons with dementia (PwD), institutionalization is common. There is a significant body of evidence that identifies dementia as the strongest predictor of institutionalization of older adults (Eaker, Vierkant, &amp; Mickel, 2002; Luppa et al., 2010), and for PwD, 20% are institutionalized in the first year and 50% within 5 years of diagnosis (Luppa, Luck, Brahler, Konig, &amp; Riedel-Heller, 2008). Care in the home setting is preferable to institutional care due to the quality of life benefits conferred by remaining in one’s community and the avoidance of poor outcomes in institutional settings (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Levy-Storms, &amp; Schuler, 2000; Prieto-Flores, Forjaz, Fernandez-Mayoralas, Rojo-Perez, &amp; Martinez-Martin, 2011). Further, the cost of institutional care for PwD incurred by PwD and their care partners is nearly twice as costly as home-based care (informal and formal) (Wubker et al., 2015).

Planning for Long-Term Care: Place of Care

Place of long-term care (LTC) can be categorized as institutional, formal in-home, and family care. Institutional care comprises care provided in nursing homes or assisted living facilities; in 2017, 1.2 million Americans aged 65+ were housed in nursing home facilities (Administration on Aging, 2018). In 2020, 2.9 million individuals are expected to receive formal in-home care—or care delivered by trained individuals who are compensated to provide in-home care (Johnson, Toohey, &amp; Wiener, 2007). Family care is defined as receiving care from family members or friends who are mostly uncompensated; 65% of older adults with LTC needs rely exclusively on family and friends to provide assistance (Houser, Gibson, &amp; Redfoot, 2010). In-home care provided by trained individuals and family members may occur simultaneously.

LTC planning is recommended to ensure that patients have resources available to make choices about preferred type of care. LTC planning is defined as “actions of preparation for a future when help with ADLs may be needed because of decrements in functional capacity” (Friedemann, Newman, Seff, &amp; Dunlop, 2004). Assessing patient preferences for care, including place of care, is the first step in LTC planning (Cantor &amp; Pearlman, 2003).

Factors That Drive Considerations of Long-Term Care for Persons with Dementia

As consideration of place of care is the first step in LTC planning, it is important to understand which patient and caregiver characteristics drive patients to consider each type of care. With this information, clinicians can guide patients and their care partners/families to begin planning for LTC. In fact, clinician support to increase intentions to seek care in non-institutional settings or bolster formal home care in the home, could be a promising alternative to offset an almost exclusive reliance on care partners or institutional care. However, currently there is limited empirical support to guide these clinician/patient interactions.

Theoretical underpinnings.

As empirical analysis about consideration of place of LTC is limited (Brown, Goda, &amp; McGarry, 2012; Schaber &amp; Stum, 2007; Sperber et al., 2017; Van Houtven, Coe, &amp; Konetzka, 2015), we draw on the evidence base about, 1) drivers of desire for institutionalization and 2) LTC planning, to identify and categorize the factors that might drive patient considerations of place of LTC. Drivers of “desire” for institution-based LTC include caregiver age, distress, social support, support for money management; patient age, education, cognitive status, mental and physical health, problem behaviors; intensity of caregiving; family dysfunction; and patient living alone (Cohen et al., 1993; Gallagher et al., 2011; McCaskill, Burgio, Decoster, &amp; Roff, 2011; Pruchno, Michaels, &amp; Potashnik, 1990; Spitznagel, Tremont, Davis, &amp; Foster, 2006; Sun et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2018). Studies about LTC planning identified key drivers of decisions to purchase LTC insurance, including concerns about financial stability, availability of reliable sources of family care (e.g. healthy spouse, geographic proximity of children), and household wealth/income. To organize and interpret our findings about potential drivers of patient consideration of place of LTC, we categorized the factors we identified in other LTC literature into the following groups: financial factors; disability and longevity; social resources/LTC alternatives (e.g. family members living close by); and other socio-economic and demographic factors. We use these categories to guide our selection of predictors to include in the analytical models. We developed Figure 1 to illustrate each construct and examples from the literature.

Study Objective

The aims of this study are two-fold: 1) to identify and describe patient and care partner characteristics associated with patient consideration of three types of LTC: institutional care (e.g. nursing home, assisted living); formal home-based care (e.g. home health aide); and family care (e.g. moving to live closer to or moving in with family members); and 2) to explore the potential joint effects (i.e. interactions) of drivers on patient preference of which LTC settings they would consider in the future. This is the first study to explicitly identify drivers of types of LTC that patients considered. Understanding these drivers is critical to ensure that patients have the opportunity to articulate their preferences for LTC setting. Further, our approach acknowledges that decisions about long-term care are rooted in complex social processes that are likely influenced by more than one driver. This study does not examine drivers of ultimate placement, and it is possible that patient considerations might change based on health shocks or other events. Yet, understanding the drivers of types of care that patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia consider helps family members, providers, and patients plan ahead to meet patient care preferences. We apply machine learning approaches to identify these drivers; these approaches are exploratory methods that search for patterns in data when existing evidence is limited. The methods used also search for interactive patterns so that joint effects can be modeled.

Methods

Data and Sample

Study setting and participants.

The data are from the CARE-IDEAS study; a supplemental study of the IDEAS study which examined how receipt of an amyloid PET scan to detect plaque in the brain that may be indicative of Alzheimer’s Disease impacted health service use. The details of the IDEAS study can be found at (“iDEAS: Imaging Dementia--Evidence for Amyloid Scanning,” 2018). IDEAS respondents (n=18,295) were Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older who were diagnosed with MCI or dementia of uncertain cause and referred by their provider to receive an amyloid PET scan. Participants who agreed to be re-contacted for supplemental studies were contacted via telephone by trained TrialMatch® agents from the Alzheimer’s Association. Information collected included patient and care partner demographics, health, cognitive status, emotional health and LTC planning. A total of 2,228 patients and 1,872 care partners completed the baseline interview. The median time between the date of the amyloid PET scan and the CARE-IDEAS baseline interview was 4.5 months. CARE-IDEAS recruitment and enrollment protocols and documents were approved by an academic Institutional Review Board (#1606001534).

Sample selection.

The CARE-IDEAS baseline survey collected data using two versions of the survey instrument; the data from the present study included the subsample of patients and care partners who responded to the first survey instrument version (n=1,013) which contained detailed information about the outcomes of interest. Inclusion in this study was also limited to respondents for whom both the patient and care partner had completed the baseline interview (n=869).

Data accessibility.

Data are accessible on the Brown Digital Repository (https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:881729/) which includes a CARE-IDEAS codebook, a supplemental codebook for the outcome variables calculated for this particular study, and a word file with a description of the software used and syntax used for data cleaning and the final analytical models.

Analytical Approach

Outcome variables.

The outcome variables assessed whether patients had considered each of three types of LTC: 1) formal home-based care, 2) institutional care, and 3) family care. Each outcome variable was coded as a binary 1 (yes, considered) or 0 (did not consider). Outcomes were defined using the following survey questions asked of the patient:

Consideration of formal home-based care: “Have you considered formal home care options, like agencies or providers, who could help you in the home if you fall into poor health and are no longer able to be totally independent?”

Consideration of institutional care: “Have you considered moving to an assisted living facility or nursing home?”

Consideration of family care was only asked of patients who reported that they had children or other family members (n=850 of 869). This variable was coded as 1 if the respondent answered yes to any of the following questions: 1) “Because of your memory problems, have you considered moving closer to children or family?”; 2) “Because of your memory problems, have you considered moving in with children or other family members?”; 3) “Because of your memory problems, have you considered having children or family move closer to you?”. This variable does not describe the traditional notion of family caregiving, but we assume that by moving closer to family members because of memory problems these older adults have a higher likelihood of receiving assistance from family members when needed.

Independent variables.

We examine 26 potential drivers of consideration of LTC setting that align with constructs in Figure 1 (Appendix 1 for measure details and variable specification), including:

patient household income (10 categories);

LTC insurance (yes versus no);

whether the patient had consulted a financial planner about LTC (yes versus no);

patient and care partner perceived financial satisfaction (satisfied versus not satisfied);

the degree to which caregiving affected the family finances using a 3-item subscale from the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (Given et al., 1992);

patient’s marital status (married versus not);

patient gender (male versus female);

patient and care partner age (continuous age in years);

care partner’s self-assessed health status (SF-36) (excellent/good versus otherwise);

patient health status (SF-36) (excellent/good versus otherwise);

care partner depressive symptoms screen measured using the PHQ2 (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2003);

care partner Zarit burden score (Bedard et al., 2001; S. H. Zarit, Orr, N.K., &amp; Zarit, J.M., 1985; S. H. Zarit, Reever, &amp; Bach-Peterson, 1980);

whether the patient’s children live within 30 minutes (yes versus no);

care partner and patient loneliness measured using 3-item Loneliness scale (Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, &amp; Cacioppo, 2004);

whether the patient’s interpretation of amyloid PET scan results was the same as the radiologist’s interpretation (correct versus incorrect);

patient reported score from an abbreviated version of the Modified Telephone Interview Cognitive Status (TICS-M) (Welsh, Breitner, &amp; Magruder-Habib, 1993);

care partner report of patient cognitive function measured using the 12-item Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-12);

years since onset of cognitive impairment, patient’s health now compared to one year ago (better versus not);

relevant medical history (yes for chronic heart failure, arterial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or diabetes);

family history of dementia (yes versus no);

patient’s educational attainment (5 categories) and;

patient’s race (White vs. not)

Statistical analysis.

Overview and rationale of method choice.

To address aim 1, we used three algorithms to identify drivers of the outcomes: random forests, lasso logistic regression, and gradient boosting. While these algorithms are most commonly used to develop predictive models, they can be used to describe complex patterns in the data; we use these methods for the latter purpose. These methods have several advantages over traditional regression for describing associations. First, they provide built-in ways to tune parameters to achieve the best model possible for the outcome even in cases where prediction is not the goal of interest. Second, they provide easily interpretable information to explain which variables are most strongly related to the outcome of interest. Moreover, the tree-based methods (random forest, gradient boosting, and decision trees) allow data-driven discovery of interactions among variables toreveal a complex interplay between drivers. As opposed to looking at main effects, as in a regression model, modelling complex joint effects of drivers is likely a more accurate representation of how these factors operate in reality. To address aim 2, we select the drivers identified in aim 1 to build a classification tree—a decision tree with a binary outcome. Classification trees describe and display how multiple factors interact to drive considerations of types of LTC among older adults with cognitive impairment.

As purpose of this study is to understand relationships among drivers rather than predict outcomes, we evaluate model performance based on consistency of relationships discovered as opposed to the predictive capacity of the models.

Aim 1 approach.

A decision tree is built by partitioning the potential cross-classifications of many independent variables to describe how they interact to influence an outcome; in other words, the covariate space is split until all subjects have been divided into homogenous groups that belong to the same outcome class (i.e. Y=0 or Y=1). Random forests and gradient boosting methods construct many decision trees and average the results across those trees. The difference between these approaches is that gradient boosting improves model performance by beginning with trees that do not explain the association well and adding subsequent trees to the forest that better explain the outcome; gradient boosting often performs well on data with imbalanced outcome classes, such as the institutional care outcome of which only 21% of the sample said they would consider. Random forests iteratively search the variable space over many decision trees to identify the combination of variables that are most strongly associated with the outcome. Both approaches rank the relative importance of variables based on how much they influence the outcome. Lasso logistic regression is a penalized form of logistic regression that shrinks the coefficients of variables not related to the outcome to 0 to improve overall model performance.

Each outcome was modeled separately using each algorithm; 26 variables were included in each model. Care partner gender was removed due to high correlation with patient marital status. The data were randomly split equally into training and validation data; we then tuned the algorithms on the training data to get the “best model” and ran the best model on the full dataset to identify the most important variables. Random forest models can be optimized using several parameters, including the number of variables randomly selected to fit each tree and the number of observations in each leaf (or terminal node). We tuned the random forest models using these parameters and constructed 500 trees by randomly sampling the training data with replacement (R Studio, randomForestSRC package). For the gradient boosting algorithm, we tuned the algorithm on the number of 1) levels in the tree (i.e. variable interactions), 2) individuals in each identified cross-classification group (n of each leaf), 3) observations used to grow trees, and 4) variables used to grow trees. We constructed 500 trees by randomly sampling the data with replacement (R Studio, eXtreme Gradient Boosting Training package). For random forest and gradient boosting models, we plotted the variables ranked by importance. To identify the best lasso model in the training data, we tuned the complexity parameter, lambda. The size of the complexity parameter influences the propensity of the model to shrink parameter estimates towards zero (R Studio, glmnet package). The best lasso model was run in the full data. Variables were retained in the classification trees (aim 2) if they met the variable importance criteria in at least two models; these criteria were: having an importance factor of &gt;0.008 in the random forest model; &gt;0.5 relative importance in the boosted gradient model; and a non-zero coefficient in the lasso model. As there is no guidance on variable importance thresholds, importance criteria were determined by visually inspecting the graphs.

Aim 2 approach:

We used variables identified as important, per the above criteria, to construct classification trees (Hothorn, Hornik, &amp; Zeileis, 2006) for each outcome on the full dataset; we then plotted each tree (R Studio, ctree package). Classification trees are prone to overfitting the data so another advantage of selecting variables using random forests, gradient boosting and lasso was to identify the subset of variables to include in the classification trees. To assess model consistency, we performed cross-fold validation; we cut the data into 10-folds and ran the classification tree algorithm in each fold. Across those folds we examined if: 1) all trees identified the same combination of important variables as the tree that used the full data, 2) the number of individuals in the leaves were similar across trees, and 3) the probability of the outcome was similar in nodes across trees.

Missing data.

All variables were missing at least one observation. While missing data were minimal (&lt;3% for the outcomes and &lt;6% for all the variables except for “year of symptom onset” (16% missing) and household income (12% missing)), the packages that we used to run the decision trees and lasso regression require complete data. Therefore, we used an imputeddataset for all models. Data were imputed using adaptive tree imputations—a random forest machine learning algorithm that adaptively imputes missing data as the tree is grown using randomly drawn non-missing in-sample data (R Studio, randomSurvivalForest package).

Results

Fifty percent of participants reported having considered family care options. Approximately, 40% of patients considered paying for home-based care, such as a home health aide, and 21% considered institutional care. Over 70% of patients reported considering at least one of these three options, but fewer than 10% of patients reported that they had considered all three types of care. Among the 178 patients who said that they had considered nursing home care, 67% also considered formal home-based care and 58% considered family care. Of the 351 patients who considered formal home-based care, 58% also considered family care. Our sample comprises a relatively white, educated, and high-income group. The large majority (90%) of care partners were spouses or partners; of the remaining 10%, caregivers were the care recipient’s children, siblings and friends (Table 1).

Most Important Variables Identified by the Random Forests

In Table 2 we present the important variables most influencing LTC consideration. Note that while these models identify important variables, they do not indicate the directionality of effect. Our approach was robust. This was supported by that fact that the three models contributed to identifying the most important variables; no single model was clearly superior. Consulting with a financial planner was important for formal and institutional care. For institutional care, patient cognitive status and loneliness were also important drivers. Marital status was important for formal in-home care and family care. Having the patient’s child live within 30 minutes was also important for family care. Also important were patient demographics, including age and gender. Most variables that were associated with the outcomes were related to patient characteristics. Variables related to the care partner’s capacity to provide care, such as depression, burden, and health status, were not identified as important in these models.

Interpreting Classification Trees

Formal home-based care.

Figure 2 is the plot of the classification tree from the formal home-based care outcome. The number above each oval is the node number. Each box represents a leaf or a node in the last level of the tree; the scale on the boxes indicates the probability that individuals in that node considered formal home-based care. Results from the classification tree suggested that marital status was the most important factor; among those who were married, having consulted a financial planner was also an important driver (Figure 2). This model suggests that patients who are not married are more likely to consider formal home-based care than those who are married. However, among those who are married, patients are more likely to consider formal home-based care if they also consulted a financial planner. Patient age did not appear in the classification tree which suggests that this variable was not sufficiently associated with patient consideration of formal home-based care.

Trees were consistent across the 10 folds of our data. All trees identified marital status as the factor most associated with the outcome; moreover, all trees identified joint effects (i.e. interactions) between being married and consulting with a financial planner; one tree identified an interaction between consulting with a financial planner and being not married.

Institutional care.

Patient loneliness was the most important factor; patients with higher loneliness scores were more likely to report having considered institutional care. Patients who were less lonely (loneliness score ≤7) and who had consulted a financial planner were more likely to have considered institutional care compared to patients who had not consulted a financial planner (Figure 3). Across folds of the data the trees were less consistent. All 10 trees included having consulted with a financial planner; of those trees, 7 found that consulting with a financial planner was the most important factor. Nine trees included patient loneliness and only 3 trees identified loneliness as the most important variable. Four trees also identified interactions with care partner reported patient cognitive function.

Family care.

The decision tree identified having a child living within 30 minutes as the most important factor (Figure 4). Female patients with children living close were more likely to have considered moving in with family compared to male patients. Among patients whose children did not live close by, those who were unmarried were more likely to have considered moving in with/closer to family than married patients. Across folds of the data the trees were highly consistent and mirrored the classification tree from the full data.

Discussion

We explored drivers of patient consideration of three types of LTC; while most of the sample considered at least one place of care, 30% of patients reported that they had not considered any type of LTC. Financial considerations (e.g. having consulted with a financial planner around LTC), LTC alternatives (e.g. marital status), and patient demographics (e.g. patient gender) were generally identified as important. These findings are consistent with the LTC planning literature which shows that availability of informal care decreases the likelihood of making financial investments in formal LTC by purchasing LTC insurance (Van Houtven et al., 2015). In our study, proximity of children was associated with consideration of family care and being married was inversely associated with consideration of formal home care. Available financial resources are associated with LTC insurance purchase (Brown &amp; Finkelstein, 2008; Broyles et al., 2016; Schaber &amp; Stum, 2007; Van Houtven et al., 2015); in our study financial planning increased the likelihood that patients would consider formal home and institutional care. Our findings did not support the importance of disability/longevity factors and care alternatives related to care partner health and well-being (e.g. care partner burden/mental health) that have been shown to predict desire for institutional care (Cohen et al., 1993; Gallagher et al., 2011; Pruchno et al., 1990; Spitznagel et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2018). Financial planning and being married jointly effected consideration of formal home care; this mirrors existing literature showing that financial decisions related to LTC planning often occur as a family decision-making process to protect bequests for surviving members (Sperber et al., 2017; Van Houtven et al., 2015). Finally, we found that female patients were more likely to consider moving closer to/in with children. Stability in the classification trees for formal home care and family care among cross-folds provides support for our conclusions; the institutional care models were less consistent.

Strengths.

This study is one of the few that applies data-driven machine learning approaches to understand complex social processes that rely on input from a system of actors (e.g. patient, care partner, other family members, care providers, etc.) (Brown et al., 2012; Broyles et al., 2016; Sperber et al., 2017). Specifically, a benefit of decision tree algorithms is their capacity to capture complex joint effects that are reflective of realities of LTC planning (Brown et al., 2012; Broyles et al., 2016). For example, our decision trees show that while marital status is important for considering formal home-based care, being married operates jointly with whether the patient consulted a financial planner. In other words, there is an interaction between being married and consulting a financial planner that influences the outcome; this is not a relationship that we would have easily discovered using traditional regression methods without increasing our risk of spurious findings. Forest-based methods and decision trees are also non-parametric and thus make no assumption about the underlying distributions of the data.

Limitations.

We were unable to account for systems-level drivers of considerations of place of care, such as government assistance through Medicaid for nursing home care. As our data are cross-sectional, we are unable to provide insight about how variables are related to the outcomes (i.e. whether variables are confounders or are on the causal pathway) or to tease out reverse causality. We are also not able to assess whether the influence of each variable is related to unobserved factors; for example, individuals who consult with a financial planner may be more likely to have considered LTC options or may be more risk adverse. Each outcome was modelled as an independent factor. It is possible that the outcomes are not independent and that there may be a hierarchy in how patients consider each place of care. For example, research shows that 50% older adults without family care live in institutional settings compared to 7% of older adults who have a care partner (Administration on Aging, 2013). However, questions were administered as independent items and therefore we are unable to assess hierarchy of preferences. Finally, care partner considerations of care setting are likely important drivers of types of care that patients consider; however, we did not ask care partners all the same questions and thus we are unable to assess the influence of care partner perspectives. Future research should also consider the hierarchy of patients’ preferences for place of care and trade-offs in preferences given one’s health state.

Our sample also has limitations. Our sample is homogenous–representing a group of white, highly educated and wealthy individuals who may have more available financial and social resources than similar aged persons nationally. In that planning for LTC is a luxury, this sample may be more apt to engage in planning compared to lower resource older adults. Therefore, the factors identified in this study might not generalize to other groups or we may have missed important variables for other groups. These findings need to be replicated in a larger, more diverse sample.

Implications.

Having considered any place of long-term care was not universal. This is especially concerning for patients with MCI and dementia who face an uncertain trajectory of decline. Clinicians who work with family members and patients with cognitive impairment and dementia are well-placed to help families begin to think about LTC. With advancing cognitive impairment, care partners may have more difficulty representing patient preferences; therefore,it is important to have these conversations when patients can provide input (Jutkowitz, Van Houtven, Plassman, &amp; Mor, 2019). Time of diagnosis of cognitive impairment is an opportunity for teams of providers to give information and resources and help families make difficult decisions about inevitable LTC needs.

Understanding drivers of patient considerations of LTC can be helpful for clinicians who work with patients with MCI and dementia and their care partners. Specifically, awareness of what questions to ask based on what factors drive consideration of LTC setting can help to guide these discussions. Considerations around LTC are complex and not driven solely by one factor or by factors that appear in medical records, such as patient age, gender or cognitive status; this complexity necessitates that these conversations cover a range of potentially sensitive topics, including the geographic and relational proximity of family members and financial status. Care partner burden and distress were not drivers of patient-reported considerations of care; it is possible that if care partners had been asked, that indicators of caregiver distress may have been more strongly associated with the outcomes. Therefore, clinicians may need to draw care partners into the conversation to ensure that their views are represented in LTC plans. Additionally, important drivers differed across care setting, suggesting that conversations between clinicians and families might need to evolve as the patient’s functional status changes and some settings become more appropriate than others. Last, the importance of financial planning for formal care might suggest that clinic social workers or case managers refer families to financial counseling early during the course of the disease. If families receive financial counseling, they will be better placed to structure their financial situation to allow the patient to remain in his/her preferred LTC setting as long as possible.

As this study is exploratory, results need to be confirmed by future research. However, this study is the first to examine drivers of considerations of LTC settings. Therefore, our results can be used by researchers who study LTC preferences to inform data collection of potential confounders of LTC preference outcomes. The results from this study are also valuable for shaping paradigms of LTC preferences for home-based care that currently have limited theoretical underpinnings.

A radiologist at each site interpreted each patient’s scan result as positive or negative for beta-amyloid; patients with uninterpretable/technically inadequate scans were excluded. Patients were asked to report their understanding of the scan result. A binary variable was constructed to assess concordance between the patient’s interpretation and the radiologist’s interpretation of the scan results 1= provided corrected interpretation of scan result; 0=incorrect interpretation	
Modified Telephone Interview Cognitive Status (TICS-M)	Higher TICS-M scores indicate better cognition (scale range 0–41) (Gallos &amp; Breitner, 1995; Welsh, Breitner, &amp; Magruder-Habib, 1993);	
12-item Everyday Cognition scale (ECog-12)	Administered to care partners to collect information about the scan recipient’s everyday cognition and functioning; higher ECog-12 scores indicate poorer function (scale range 1–4) Administered to care partners to collect information about the scan recipient’s everyday cognition and functioning; higher ECog-12 scores indicate poorer function (scale range 1–4)

Notes: To identify the most important variables for each outcome, the data were randomly split equally into training and validation data; we then tuned each of the three machine learning algorithms on the training data to get the “best model” and ran the best model on the full dataset. The most important variables were those that met the variable importance criteria in at least two models; these criteria were: having an importance factor of &gt;0.008 in the random forest model; &gt;0.5 relative importance in the boosted gradient model; and a non-zero coefficient in the lasso model.

The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
