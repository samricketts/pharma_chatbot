Balance in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients is not rigorously understood. In this study, we characterize balance using qualitative (Berg Balance Scale (BBS)) and quantitative measures (posturography), and assess relationships between qualitative and quantitative balance measures in AD. Patients with mild-moderate AD (n=48) were recruited. BBS scores and posturography metrics, including medial-lateral sway range, anterior-posterior sway range, sway area, and sway velocity, were assessed in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Adjusted linear regressions were used to assess relationships between posturography and BBS score. Mean BBS score was 50.4±5.3. In eyes-open conditions, posturography and BBS score were not significantly associated. In eyes-closed conditions, better BBS score was significantly associated with lower sway area (β = −0.91; p=0.006). Better scores of BBS items involving turning and reduced base of support were associated with greater eyes-closed sway area. Posturography in the more challenging eyes-closed condition may predict functional balance deficits in AD patients.

pmc1. INTRODUCTION:

Falls are highly prevalent among patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An estimated two-thirds of AD patients fall annually, a rate nearly double that of cognitively unimpaired older adults.1 As the population ages and the number of patients with AD is projected to increase to 14 million by 2050, managing falls in AD patients is a growing public health concern, especially given that falls are associated with an increased risk for injury and shorter survival.2 The fiscal implications too are immense, with the United States spending $50 billion and $754 million annually on medical costs related to non-fatal fall injuries and fatal falls, respectively.3

Balance control is one of the most important biomarkers for falls, though balance function in patients with AD is not rigorously understood. Patients with AD are known to report balance deficits and associated functional difficulties.4 However, data from more quantitative balance measures, such as posturography, show conflicting results, with some studies demonstrating no difference in quantititative measures between AD patients and matched controls, while other studies that have used more challenging metrics to assess balance control have detected greater postural instability in AD patients.5,6 Moreover, the relationship between qualitative and quantitative balance measures in AD patients is unclear.

In this study, we investigated balance function in patients with mild-moderate AD using both the well-validated qualitative Berg Balance Scale (BBS) as well as rigorous quantitative posturography methods. We also evaluated the relationship between qualitative and quantitative posturography balance measures in patients with AD. These data provide preliminary insights into specific balance impairments observed in patients with AD, and provide potential targets for future therapies to improve balance control and reduce incidence of falls in patients with AD.

2. METHODS

2.1 Study Participants

Participants were recruited from March 2018 until January 2020 from the Johns Hopkins Memory and Alzheimer’s Treatment Center (JHMATC) and the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (JHADRC). Inclusion criteria were 1) Age ≥ 60 years; 2) Diagnosis of mild or moderate AD based on National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) 2011 criteria and clinical dementia rating (CDR) score of 1 or 2; and 3) mini-mental state exam (MMSE) score ≥ 18. The study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed consent, and all methods involving human participants were carried out in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.2 Balance Control

The Berg Balance Scale and the BalanSens posturography system (BioSensics LLC, Brookline, MA) were used to assess balance function. BBS assesses the ability to maintain balance during a set of 14 simple, everyday tasks. Each task is scored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from zero (patient is unable to complete task) to four (patient performed task independently without difficulty), for a total possible score of 56. BalanSens was used to measure quantitative postural stability while subjects stood with their feet together and arms at their sides for 40 seconds, first with their eyes open, then eyes closed. Center-of-mass sway area, sway velocity, medio-lateral (ML) sway range, and antero-posterior (AP) sway range via a waist-worn accelerometer were assessed for both eyes-open and eyes-closed trials. Among the cohort of patients with AD, 48 patients safely provided postural stability measurements in both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions.

2.3 Statistical Analyses

Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between BBS score and quantitative posturography metrics. Linear regressions were also conducted to investigate the relationship between MMSE score with BBS score and posturography metrics. Multivariate linear regressions were used to adjust the models for age, sex, and MMSE score. Statistical significance was defined as p≤0.05.

3. RESULTS

3.1 Demographic information and balance assessments of AD patients

The mean (± SD) age of the cohort was 74.9 ± 7.4 years, and 55% of the participants were male. The mean MMSE score was 22.9 ± 3.8. Patients with AD had a mean BBS score of 50.4 ± 5.3. Performance on each task of the BBS is presented in Supplementary Table 1. Patients with AD exhibited difficulty in tasks associated with movement/turning and reduced base of support (e.g. tandem stance and 1-legged stance). In the eyes-open condition, mean (± SD) medial-lateral sway range was 0.89 ± 0.45 cm, anterior-posterior sway range was 1.05 ± 0.49 cm, sway area was 0.72 ± 0.84 cm2, and sway velocity was 0.66 ± 0.12 cm/sec. In the eyes-closed condition, mean (± SD) medial-lateral sway range was 0.86 ± 0.61 cm, anterior-posterior sway range was 1.13 ± 0.76 cm, sway area was 0.92 ± 1.98 cm2, and sway velocity was 0.70 ± 0.18 cm/sec. In general, patients with AD had greater postural instability in the eyes-closed condition, although differences between eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions were not statistically significant. MMSE score was not found to be significantly associated with composite BBS score (β=0.11; p=0.67), medial-lateral sway range in eyes-open (β=0.00; p=0.87) and eyes-closed conditions (β=−0.01; p=0.72), anterior-posterior sway range in eyes-open (β=−0.01; p=0.61) and eyes-closed conditions (β=−0.03; p=0.43), sway area in eyes-open (β=−0.01; p=0.78) and eyes-closed conditions (β=0.05; p=0.59), and sway velocity in eyes-open (β=0.00; p=0.82) and eyes-closed conditions (β=0.00; p=0.74).

Characteristic posturography traces from an AD patient comparing eyes-open to eyes-closed conditions are shown in Figure 1. In the eyes-open condition, medial-lateral sway and anterior-posterior sway were 0.65 cm and 0.39 cm, respectively. In the eyes-closed condition, medial-lateral sway and anterior-posterior sway were 1.08 cm and 1.94 cm, respectively.

3.2 Relationship between Berg Balance Score and posturography metrics

In the eyes-open condition for patients with AD, greater BBS composite score was significantly associated with increased ML sway range in unadjusted analysis (β = 4.20; p=0.018). When adjusting for age, sex, and MMSE score, however, no significant relationships between postugrography metrics and BBS score were noted in the eyes-open condition. In the eyes-closed condition, increased sway area was significantly associated with lower BBS scores in unadjusted (β = −1.18; p=0.003) and adjusted (β = −0.91; p=0.006) analyses. Additionally, a borderline non-significant negative relationship was identified between sway velocity and BBS score in adjusted analyses (β = −7.02; p=0.067; Table 1).

No significant relationships were identified between posturography metrics and performance on individual BBS tasks in the eyes-open condition. In contrast, poorer performance on tasks involving movement/turning and reduced base of support (e.g. tandem stance and 1-legged stance) was significantly associated with greater postural sway area in the eyes-closed condition for patients with AD (Table 1).

4. DISCUSSION:

Falls are highly common among patients with AD, and are associated with an increased risk for injury, earlier institutionalization, and shorter survival.2 Balance function is among one of the most important risk factors for falls but is poorly characterized in AD patients. In particular, results of static posturography in AD patients are currently limited in the literature, and the relationship between qualitative BBS and quantitative posturography in both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions is poorly understood in this patient population.

In this study, the mean BBS score of our cohort was 50.4 ± 5.3, which is consistent with prior reports in AD patients.7,8 Patients with AD specifically exhibited difficulty with BBS tasks involving weight-shifting, turning, and reduced base of support (e.g. tandem stance and 1-legged stance). Additionally, compared to posturography results of healthy elderly subjects found in the literature, AD patients in our cohort exhibited worse static posturography, with marked deficits in medial-lateral stability.10 When examining the association between qualitative and quantitative measures, BBS score was not significantly associated with any posturography metric in the eyes-open condition in adjusted analyses. In contrast, in the eyes-closed condition, AD patients with better BBS scores had significantly lower sway area and marginally significantly lower sway velocity in adjusted analyses. Moreover, poorer performance on BBS tasks involving turning and reduced base of support was significantly associated with greater postural sway area in the eyes-closed condition.

These results suggest that more challenging conditions (e.g. eyes-closed) should be used to identify postural impairment in AD patients, and that these quantitative postural impairments (e.g. higher sway) have functional balance consequences. Notably, eyes-closed balance tasks largely tap into proprioceptive and vestibular functions, and deficits in these sensory systems may play a substantive role in balance impairment in AD patients, as has been suggested by prior studies.9 Moreover, the specific BBS tasks significantly associated with posturography, involving turning and a reduced base of support, are also well-known to occur in the setting of vestibular and proprioceptive sensory losses.11 Quantitative posturography in eyes-closed conditions therefore may allow us to identify AD patients at risk for balance impairment due to proprioceptive and vestibular deficits, and expedite the provision of appropriate therapies to improve balance control and attenuate fall risk in this patient population.

As our sample size of AD patients was small, analyses investigating the relationship between MMSE score and balance metrics were under-powered, and should be re-conducted in future studies with larger cohort sizes. Moreover, we recognize that as our cohort was derived from a single institution, results may not be representative and should be validated in subsequent, multi-institutional studies. Despite these limitations, our study asserts that AD patients exhibit balance impairments, and that quantitative posturography in eyes-closed conditions can capture functional balance deficits specifically related to turning and a reduced base of support. Our results may help inform development of a standardized protocol of posturography – requiring eyes-closed testing – used for balance assessment in AD patients.

5. CONCLUSION

Balance function in patients with AD is not rigorously understood. In this study, we report quantitative posturography metrics of patients with AD, and assess the relationship between posturography assessments and BBS score. In the eyes-open condition, posturography metrics were not predictive of BBS score, while a significant negative relationship between sway area and BBS score was identified in the eyes-closed condition. Posturography in eyes-closed conditions captures a certain set of functional balance deficits related to turning and reduced base of support in AD patients.
