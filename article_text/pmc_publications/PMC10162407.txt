Tauopathies are a family of neurodegenerative diseases which predominately afflict the rapidly growing aging population suffering from various brain disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 and Pick disease. As the only visually accessible region of the central nervous system, in recent years, the retina has attracted extensive attention for its potential as a target for visualizing and quantifying emerging biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous study has found that retinal vascular inflammation and leakage occur at the very early stage of tauopathic mouse model. Here, we aimed to non-invasively visualize age-dependent alterations of retinal vasculature assessing the potential for using changes in retinal vasculature as the biomarker for the early diagnosis of tauopathy. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a non-invasive depth-resolved high-resolution imaging technique was used to visualize and quantify tauopathy-induced alterations of retinal vasculature in P301S transgenic mice overexpressing the P301S mutant form of human tau and age-matched wild type littermate mice at 3, 6 and 10 months of age. We observed significant alterations of vascular features in the intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) but not in the superficial vascular complex (SVC) of P301S mice at early stages of tauopathy. With aging, alterations of vascular features in P301S mice became more prominent in all three vascular plexuses. Staining of retinal vasculature in flatmounts and trypsin digests of P301S mice at 10 months of age revealed decreased vessel density and increased acellular capillary formation, indicating that vascular degeneration also occurs during tauopathy. Overall, our results demonstrate that the changes in retinal vascular features accelerate during the progression of tauopathy. Vessels in the ICP and DCP may be more susceptible to tauopathy than vessels in the SVC. Since changes in retinal vasculature often precede tau pathology in the brain, non-invasive identification of retinal vascular alterations with OCTA may be a useful biomarker for the early diagnosis of tauopathy and monitoring its progression.

pmc1. Introduction

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein which is predominately concentrated in the axons of neurons. The primary physiologic role of tau is to promote the assembly and stabilization of tubulin, but it has also been shown that tau interacts with motor proteins (Dixit et al., 2008), histone deacetylases (Ding et al., 2008), and even DNA (Hua et al., 2003). Its activity is regulated via phosphorylation, and hyperphosphorylation is one of most well-known causes of tau disease states (Ando et al., 2016). Indeed, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated or aggregated tau proteins is a hallmark of tauopathies which include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick disease, and more than 20 other disorders (Gendron and Petrucelli, 2009).

Tauopathies are a major concern, as they are some of the most debilitating and prevalent conditions among the rapidly growing aging population. For example, more than 44 million people worldwide have AD and it is the 5th leading cause of death in the elderly population (Dumurgier and Sabia, 2020). One contributory factor to the high mortality rate of tauopathies could be the lack of widely available reliable and sensitive tests that can be used for screening, diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression, and its response to emerging interventions. Current methods of diagnosis rely upon eliciting patient symptoms, identifying the disease course, and conducting a neuro- or psychiatric evaluation (Atri, 2019; Erkkinen et al., 2018). Unfortunately, these methods identify diseases at the stage of dementia which is decades after the onset of pathophysiology, thus reducing the timeline for therapeutic intervention. In recent years, the discovery of emerging biomarkers including measurement of amyloid and tau in cerebrospinal fluid, analysis of brain structural changes by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and examination of functional change or β amyloid (Aβ) deposits and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain by positron emission tomography (PET) have had significant impacts on the availability of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools for the detection and monitoring of AD (Khoury and Ghossoub, 2019). However, the sensitivity and specificity of these techniques for early diagnosis of AD as well as their ability to predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD are not satisfying. Moreover, the whole-body image-based approach as well as sampling of spinal fluid are expensive, time intensive, and/or invasive, making them unsuitable as routine screening tools for tauopathies (Bautista et al., 2009; Keppler and Conti, 2001; Mushlin et al., 1997; Schmidt et al., 2010).

As an extension of the central nervous system (CNS), the retina shares many similarities with the brain in both physiology and pathology (Chiasseu et al., 2017; Chiquita et al., 2019; London et al., 2013). The retina has an abundance of neurons including retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), a variety of glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes, and a rich blood vascular network (Jindal, 2015). Additionally, numerous studies in rodent models and post-mortem human subjects have demonstrated that tau accumulates in the retina during tauopathy (Chiasseu et al., 2017; den Haan et al., 2018; Xia et al., 2021). These similarities make the retina an ideal site for early detection of tauopathy and monitoring the progression of the disease. Prior studies of retinal changes accompanying the progression of tauopathy are either clinical studies which cannot control for confounding variables such as age and are limited to the stage when cognitive impairment becomes noticeable or primarily focused on characterizing the neuronal changes as well as using histological methods to characterize vascular changes in animal models (Bennett et al., 2020; Bull et al., 2012; Hart et al., 2016; Nazari et al., 2022; Ramirez et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2020).

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a rapid, cost effective, non-invasive and dye-free imaging modality which enables three-dimensional visualization of functional retinal vasculature and assessment of the severity of capillary non-perfusion and degeneration. The principle of OCTA is based on motion contrast imaging (de Carlo et al., 2015; Luisi et al., 2019; Spaide et al., 2015), in which successive b-scans are taken at each predetermined retinal layer and the backscattered signal intensity and amplitude are compared. Assuming the retina is stationary, differences in decorrelation signal between sequential b-scans are attributed to erythrocyte movement and transformed into a cohesive angiographic image (Spaide et al., 2015). Here, we employed OCTA using the Heidelberg HRA + OCT Spectralis (Hirano et al., 2018) to monitor longitudinal changes of retinal vasculature in a mouse model of tauopathy (P301S mice). We found significant decreases in vessel density, number of branch points, and total vessel length in the retina during tauopathy. Furthermore, we observed that these changes were more pronounced in the intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and deep capillary plexus (DCP) suggesting that vessels in the ICP and DCP may be more susceptible to tauopathy. Staining of retinal vasculature in flatmounts and trypsin digests of P301S mice at 10 months of age revealed decreased vessel density and increased acellular capillary formation, indicating that vascular degeneration also occurs during tauopathy. Moreover, we compared the results from OCTA imaging to histological assessment of retinal flatmounts from the same retina imaged via confocal microscopy. The alterations in vasculature seen with OCTA were more pronounced than the changes seen by confocal imaging, further indicating that using OCTA to visualize functional blood vessels in the eye may be an effective tool for the early diagnosis of tauopathy.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals

All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). C57BL/6J WT mice (Stock No: 000664) were originally obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred in the animal care facility at UTMB. P301S hemizygous mice (Stock No: 008169) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and bred with C57BL/6J mice to generate WT and P301S littermates (Xia et al., 2021). All founder mouse lines were confirmed not to bear common mutant genes (e.g. Rd1 and Rd8) for retinal degeneration. Retinas from WT and P301S mice at 3 months of age (n = 12 &amp; n = 14, respectively), 6 months of age (n = 16 &amp; n = 16, respectively), and 10–11 months of age (n = 21 &amp; n = 24, respectively) were examined. Additionally, retinas imaged at 6 months of age were reimaged at 10 months of age to allow for direct comparison between OCTA scans 4 months apart. During and after breeding, all mice were maintained on a 12:12 light/dark cycle and had ab libitum access to food and water.

2.2. Imaging preparations

Before OCTA imaging, mice were anesthetized with 3.8% isoflurane using a Digital Low-Flow Anesthesia System (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) and mydriasis was achieved with one drop of phenylephrine and one drop of tropicamide. Mice were subsequently wrapped in cotton to maintain body temperature and placed on an imaging platform with a heating pad and continuous supply of 3.8% isoflurane through a nose cone. During imaging, corneal clouding was impeded through the application of Isopto® Tears (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX) between scans and GenTeal® Tears Lubricant Eye Gel (Alcon Laboratories, Inc.,) on the eye that was not being actively imaged.

2.3. Multimodal imaging

Multimodal imaging was performed with the Heidelberg HRA + OCT Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). OCTA scans were acquired using a 30-degree lens and mouse adaptor lens. Each OCTA scan consisted of a 20° × 20° (0.8 mm × 0.8 mm) volume, and each volume consisted of 512 B scans 1 μm apart and 512 A scans. Five repeated B scans were taken at each position to compute speckle variance for OCTA image construction. OCTA scans were taken at each quadrant of the retina with the optic disc in the corner (Fig. 1), unless corneal clouding occurred before OCTA image was taken. Quality control was completed using a built-in software module within Heidelberg Eye Explorer version 6.12.4.0 which assigned a quality control index to each image during OCTA scanning. In our analysis, we excluded OCTA images with major image artifacts due to respiration, blink or poor-quality control index of 25 dB or less.

Each OCTA image was analyzed using the AngioTool software (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) as described previously (Zudaire et al., 2011) (Fig. 1B). Vessel density, total vessel length, and total number of junctions were recorded for each image and averaged across all imaged quadrants for each retina. This calculated mean value for each retina was designated as an individual data point in statistical analysis. For all image measurements, examiners were blinded to mice genotype.

2.4. Staining of retinal vasculature

After OCTA imaging of 10-month-old mice, they were euthanized and their eyes were fixed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C overnight. Next, retinas were dissected, washed with PBS, blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.3% Triton-X-100 for 3 h. Subsequently, retinas were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-Conjugated Isolectin B4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 4 °C for 3 days. After washing, retinas were mounted and imaged by confocal microscopy (LSM 800, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY).

Confocal images were paired with the corresponding position of prior OCTA scans of mice at 10 months of age. Moreover, confocal images taken at central and mid-peripheral retinas (Fig. 1A) were analyzed with AngioTool for vessel density. Data from each retinal quadrant was likewise averaged and included as one data point in statistical analysis.

2.5. Trypsin digestion

The eyes from 10-month-old WT and P301S mice were enucleated and fixed in PBS containing 2% PFA overnight at room temperature. The retinas were then dissected and incubated with 3% trypsin (Difco Trypsin 250, Becton Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) in PBS for 6 h at 37 °C. Non-vascular tissues were carefully brushed away and retinal vasculature was then transferred and flat-mounted onto clean glass slides for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and hemotoxylin staining (Liu et al., 2018). Eight images were taken at peripheral retina to count acellular capillary formation and data from all images of each retina was averaged to provide one data point.

2.6. Statistical analysis

The mean and standard error of the mean were calculated and reported for each group. Student’s t-test was conducted using GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA) and a p value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3. Results

3.1. Characterization of the changes of functional blood vessels in P301S retinas by OCTA

We previously demonstrated that tau accumulates in the retina of a mouse model of tauopathy - P301S transgenic mice, which overexpress the P301S mutant form of human tau (Xia et al., 2021). These mice progressively exhibit tau-induced pathology in the retina. Retinal edema and breakdown of blood–retina barrier were detected at the very early stage of tauopathy, which were followed with gliosis and neuronal loss. To rapidly and repeatedly monitor the longitudinal changes of retinal vasculature in response to the accumulation of tau non-invasively, we utilized Heidelberg HRA + OCT Spectralis to perform OCTA imaging in WT and P301S mice at 3, 6 and 10 months of age. Quality control of OCTA images was acquired by the built-in software within Heidelberg Eye Explorer during OCTA scanning. The mean image quality for WT and P301S mice at different ages was compared and found to not be statistically significant (Table 1).

To characterize the changes of retinal vasculature with age during tauopathy, OCTA images were quantitatively analyzed using the AngioTool software, including vessel density, number of junctions, and total vessel length in the superficial vascular complex (SVC), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP), respectively (Hirano et al., 2018) (Fig. 2). At 3 months of age, although retinal vasculature was not greatly altered in the SVC, significant decreases of vessel density, number of branch points, and total vessel length in the ICP and DCP were observed in the retinas of P301S mice. At 6 months of age, P301S mice demonstrated more significantly decreased vessel density, number of branch points, and total vessel length in the SVC, ICP, and DCP compared to WT mice. With aging, vessel density, branch points, and total vessel length in all three vascular plexuses were significantly decreased in P301S mice at 10 months of age compared to age-matched WT littermates (Fig. 2).

Since the retinas of P301S mice exhibited the most prominent vascular changes in the ICP and DCP, which are two sublayers of the deep vascular complex (DVC), we further compared vascular alterations in the SVC and DVC at 3, 6, and 10 months of age (Supplementary Figure 1). We observed significant loss of vessel density, number of junctions, and total vessel length in the DVC of P301S retinas as early as 3 months of age. With aging, retinal vascular features in the DVC of P301S mice progressively decreased at a faster rate than those from age-matched WT mice. Significant alterations of vessel density, vessel junctions, and total vessel length in the SVC of P301S mice were noted beginning at 6 months of age and became more pronounced at 10 months of age.

Hence, based on OCTA images, alternations of functional blood vessels in the retina are detectable earliest in the DVC, comprising the ICP and DCP, with vascular changes in these layers becoming increasingly evident with age. On the other hand, vasculature in the SVC may be less susceptible to tauopathy as changes were only significant in mice at 6 months of age and older.

3.2. Visible age-dependent decreased vessel perfusion in P301S mice

To further elucidate the progressive changes of functional retinal blood vessels during tauopathy, OCTA scans taken in the same retinas were compared at 6 and 10 months of age (Fig. 3). OCTA scans showed a trend of decreased capillary perfusion in DCP between images of WT mice at 10 months of age from images taken at 6 months of age; however, the results were not significant. Conversely, P301S mice imaged at 10 months of age demonstrated significantly decreased vascular parameters within all of three plexuses compared to their 6-month counterparts. For example, the SVC of 10-month-old P301S mice showed a 15.7% decrease in the mean number of junctions and 9.6% decrease in mean vessel length compared to those for the same retina at 6 months of age. The ICP showed an even more dramatic impairment of capillary perfusion with significant decreases in vessel density, number of junctions, and total vessel length in retinas from 10-month-old P301S mice compared to corresponding images taken at 6 months of age. Finally, P301S mice at 10 months of age had significantly less vessel density and number of junctions than corresponding P301S mice at 6 months of age, but there were no statistically significant changes in the total vessel length in the DCP. Collectively, these data indicate that tauopathy has a far greater effect on functional retinal blood vessels compared to naturally age-related vascular impairment.

3.3. Comparison of OCTA with histology at 10 Months of age

Since OCTA constructs angiographic images based on signal differential from erythrocyte movement, it provides information on functional vessels that are structurally intact and can be perfused with blood. Decreased vessel density during tauopathy detected by OCTA imaging raised a question whether retinal blood vessels also undergo degeneration in P301S mice accompanying capillary perfusion impairment. To address this question, we performed confocal microscopy of 10-month-old retinas stained with Isolectin B4 to provide images of individual layers of blood vessels, and compared these images to corresponding OCTA scans at the same location of the same retina (Fig. 4). We observed that in P301S retinas, some retinal vessels which were intact in confocal images were missing or compromised in OCTA images, suggesting that these vessels do not function properly for blood perfusion (Fig. 4). Moreover, the analysis of retinal vasculature based on confocal images revealed that the density of vasculature was decreased specifically in the ICP and DCP of 10-month-old P301S retinas in both central and mid-peripheral areas compared with WT littermates, albeit to a lesser extent compared with the difference obtained from OCTA imaging (Fig. 5A–B). Furthermore, trypsin digestion was performed to isolate retinal vascular network and detect the change of capillaries in the retina. The quantification of acellular capillary in trypsin digest of 10-month-old WT and P301S retinas revealed that acellular capillary formation was dramatically increased in P301S retinas (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results indicate that vessel degeneration as well as capillary non-perfusion occurs during tauopathy.

4. Discussion

Tauopathies are one of the most debilitating and prevalent conditions that affect the rapidly growing aging population. Current diagnostic methodologies have many limitations including lack of sensitivity and specificity needed for the detection of tauopathies at early stage, invasiveness, great expense and/or time-intensiveness. The retina, as the only CNS tissue not encased in bone, shares many similarities with the brain in both physiology and pathophysiology and offers a unique opportunity to investigate neurodegeneration by non-invasive imaging. Here we used OCTA to longitudinally assess vascular changes in a mouse model of tauopathy, specifically a P301S transgenic mouse model (Xia et al., 2021; Yoshiyama et al., 2007). We found significant and progressive decreases in vessel density, number of junctions, and total vessel length in P301S mice during aging compared to age-matched WT mice. These findings are in congruence with the studies in the brain in which reductions of cerebral blood flow and vessel degeneration are well characterized as one of the key events accompanying neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and play a critical role in neuronal dysfunction and degeneration (Cruz Hernández et al., 2019; Giannoni et al., 2016). Compared to the direct visualization of retinal vasculature by OCTA performed in clinical setting, high-resolution quantitative imaging of tauopathy-induced changes in brain vasculature is much more complicated, time consuming and expensive requiring access to whole body imaging resources (Laviña et al., 2016). Moreover, another advantage of ocular imaging for early detection of tauopathy is the fact that the decreases in vessel density and branching complexity as assessed by OCTA were observed at 3 and 6 months of age when volume reductions in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus are not yet detectable by MRI (Yoshiyama et al., 2007), indicating that OCTA is a sensitive method for early diagnosis of tauopathy. As far as we know, this is the first study to employ OCTA to characterize changes in retinal vasculature in a longitudinal study of tauopathy and to provide detailed comparison between OCTA and histological assessment. Our findings are consistent with a few clinical studies that employ OCTA to study retinal vascular changes in normal subjects and AD participants, demonstrating decreased vessel density and increased foveal avascular zone in patients with AD (Bulut et al., 2018; Grewal et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2019). However, clinical studies are less conclusive due to the complexities of the genetic and environmental backgrounds of subjects and difficulties to perform longitudinal investigation, while our work clearly showed that tauopathy itself is sufficient to induce a progressive decrease in functional vessels during aging.

There are three primary vascular plexuses of the retina: the superficial vascular complex (SVC), the intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and the deep capillary plexus (DCP) (Hirano et al., 2018). The SVC consists of larger vessels providing blood supplies to the ganglion cell layer (GCL) as well as the superficial region of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The ICP consists of smaller vessels that anastomose with the SVC and supply the inner part of the IPL and the superficial portion of the inner nuclear layer (INL). The DCP primarily supplies blood to the outer plexiform layer (OPL) as well as the INL (Campbell et al., 2017). Our data suggests that vasculatures in P301S mice are significantly affected in all three layers but those in the ICP and DCP are more sensitive to tauopathy since significant decreases in functional vessels occurred in the ICP and DCP but not SVC at early stage of tauopathy (3-month-old P301S mice). Therefore, OCTA examination of vessels in ICP and DCP may provide a sensitive method to detect tauopathy at early stage. However, it is also noted that in WT mice the number of junctions and total vessel lengths in the ICP and DCP but not in the SVC were slightly decreased with aging, although not significant. Thus, vascular alterations in the SVC may provide better specificity for tauopathy. Of note, vascular alterations in the choroid and avascular complex were also examined by OCTA. However, it was not conclusive because retinal pigment epithelial cells reduced the penetration of light used in SD-OCT, resulting in poor quality of images (Miller et al., 2017). Overall, a combination of OCTA examination of all of three vascular plexuses in the retina at different time points may be necessary for diagnosing and staging tauopathy with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.

Currently, the exact mechanisms underlying decrease in functional vessels in tauopathy are unknown. Our studies showed that vascular changes observed with OCTA were more significant than those observed via confocal microscopy. Moreover, there were structurally intact blood vessels seen in histology but absent in OCTA images. Therefore, it is likely that decreased capillary perfusion may occur in initial stages of tauopathy preceding structural changes that were observed with confocal imaging. One model of decreased cerebral perfusion in tauopathy suggests that decreased blood flow arises from occlusion of capillaries by leukocytes. For example, one study using APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mouse models of AD found that significant cortical capillary stalling from leukocyte adhesion occurred as early as 3 months of age and 6 months of age, respectively (Cruz Hernández et al., 2019). Interestingly, they observed no similar obstructions in arterioles or venules. Moreover, Bennett et al. observed that although some capillaries in the cortex of another model of tauopathy (Tg4510 mice) contained erythrocytes, many vessels appeared to contain only plasma as a result of upstream leukocyte adhesion blocking flow (Bennett et al., 2020). Similarly, these changes were only observed in vessels with diameter of &lt;4 μm. In concurrence with these findings, we found decreases in vessel density, vessel junctions, and total vessel length primarily in the DCP and ICP, retinal capillary plexuses that primarily consist of small vessels. However, we found decreased capillary perfusion to occur as early as 3 months of age while Bennet et al. discovered vascular changes in cortical blood vessels only as early as 15 months of age, further supporting the notion that neurovascular alternations of the retina may function as a highly promising biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases. It is also suggested that vascular remodeling occurs in response to decreased retinal metabolic demand from neuronal dysfunction or losses (Berisha et al., 2007; Joyal et al., 2018; Usui et al., 2015). This could be another potential mechanism by which retinal vasculature is preferentially affected in the ICP and DCP. One study by Kornfield et al. used a flickering light to induce functional hyperemia in retinal vessels and found that the capillaries in the ICP were dilated significantly more than those in the SVC or DCP (Kornfield and Newman, 2014). Furthermore, they observed a marked increase in red blood cell flux that paralleled the dilatory response in the DCP and ICP; however, this change was not observed in the SVC.

OCTA is an affordable non-invasive imaging modality and therefore has significant potential for use in a clinical setting for the early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases. Compared to angiographic gold standards, OCTA offers many advantages including the ability to acquire label-free 3D images of retina morphology and vascular architecture with high spatial resolution in clinical settings. Specifically, OCTA allows for depth-resolved and cross-sectional imaging of individual retinal capillary plexuses and is more sensitive to the alterations of blood flow than dye-based angiography (Fayed and Fawzi, 2019), enabling visualization of the fine structural and functional changes of vasculature. There is a growing body of literature which suggests OCTA has the potential to be used for diagnosis of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy at early stages and monitor disease progression (Baek et al., 2022; Holló, 2017; Kurysheva and Sharova, 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022). Moreover, numerous studies have found inner retinal thinning to be characteristic of movement disorders including Parkinson’s disease (Chrysou et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2022). Our study together with a few clinical studies (O’Bryhim et al., 2018; Querques et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020) suggests that OCTA has significant potential for the early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases as it can visualize and quantify changes in blood vessels down to the capillary level non-invasively, and can assess structural changes as well as functional information, which make it possible to monitor the progression of tauopathy by routinely monitoring retinal vasculature. Unquestionably, as one biomarker usually does not have enough power for disease diagnosis, OCTA imaging in combination with other biomarkers (e.g. analyzing phosphorylated tau and tau oligomers in plasma, measuring intraocular pressure and HbA1c to exclude glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy) are necessary to effectively and specifically detect and monitor tauopathy in the brain. Of note, current OCTA imaging system cannot examine vascular changes in the peripheral retina because of its limited field of view compared to dye-based angiography (Fayed and Fawzi, 2019). Moreover, due to the low resolution of the OCTA technique, in some areas unclear vasculature can be confused with low blood flow (Hormel et al., 2021). Future improvement of OCTA image acquisition and data processing is necessary to overcome these limitations.

In summary, using OCTA imaging technology, our results demonstrate that tauopathy-mediated vascular alterations can be detected in the retina at early stages. Furthermore, decreases in vessel density and branching complexity detected by OCTA in the ICP and DCP likely occur at an earlier stage and to a greater degree than that in the SVC. The observed vascular changes may be due to both impairment of capillary perfusion and structural degeneration although more research needs to be done to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. OCTA imaging has the potential for early diagnosis or monitoring of the progression of AD and other tauopathies, which warrants further investigation of its diagnostic capabilities.
