Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important drug target in neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s Disease, Lewy Body dementia and Parkinson’s Disease dementia, as well as for other conditions like myasthenia gravis and anticholinergic poisoning. In this study we have used a combination of high throughput screening, machine learning and docking to identify new inhibitors of this enzyme. Bayesian machine learning models were generated with literature data from ChEMBL for eel and human AChE inhibitors, as well as butyrylcholinesterase inhibitors (BuChE), and compared with other machine learning methods. High throughput screens for the eel AChE inhibitor model identified several molecules including tilorone, an antiviral drug that is well-established outside of the United States, as a newly identified nanomolar AChE inhibitor. We have described how tilorone inhibits both eel and human AChE with IC50’s of 14.4 nM and 64.4 nM, respectively, but does not inhibit the closely related butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) IC50 &gt; 50 μM. We have docked tilorone into the human AChE crystal structure and shown that this selectivity is likely due to the reliance on a specific interaction with a hydrophobic residue in the peripheral anionic site of AChE that is absent in BuChE. We also conducted a pharmacological safety profile (SafetyScreen44) and kinase selectivity screen (SelectScreen) that showed tilorone (1 μM) only inhibited AChE out of 44 toxicology target proteins evaluated and did not appreciably inhibit any of the 485 kinases tested. This study suggests there may be a potential role for repurposing tilorone or its derivatives in conditions that benefit from AChE inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is the enzyme responsible for terminating the majority of acetylcholine neurotransmission at neuromuscular junctions and cholinergic synapses. Unlike other neurotransmitters, acetylcholine is not taken up at the synapse to be recycled but is instead hydrolyzed by cholinesterases into choline and acetic acid 1. Because of the important role of AChE in the central and peripheral nervous systems, inhibitors of this enzyme can be useful in mitigating the symptoms of some neurological disorders 1. AChE inhibitors are prescribed for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting in a concentrated loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain 2. As cholinergic neurons die, less acetylcholine is produced and AChE inhibitors like the FDA-approved donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, prevent depletion of this crucial neurotransmitter. These drugs are not curative, but instead are prescribed to slow the rate of cognitive decline caused by the disease. AChE inhibitors are also used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis 3, Lewy Body dementia 4, and glaucoma 5, and are currently under investigation for therapeutic efficacy in schizophrenia 6 and Parkinson’s disease dementia 7. The AChE inhibitor physostigmine is also used as a therapy for acute cases of anticholinergic poisoning caused by anticholinergic agents like some antihistamines or tricyclic antidepressants 8. Ideally, new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, especially ones with milder side-effects than those currently in use, may have therapeutic potential.

There has been much interest in finding new acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in recent years. One strategy is to look for novel inhibitors from natural sources, as galantamine was isolated from the snowdrop Galanthus nivalis and Huperzine A was isolated from the club moss Huperzia serrata 9. AChE inhibitors have therefore continued to be found in the extracts of plants 10, 11 and marine sponges 12, 13. Synthetic analogs and derivatives of these natural products have also been synthesized in an effort to find more AChE inhibitors. Derivatives from active compounds in peppers 14, and trees 15, 16 have been produced, as well as derivatives of whole chemical classes of compounds like diterpenoids 17, flavonoids 18, 19 and coumarins 20, 21. Additionally, compounds either derived from or incorporating the commercial inhibitors donepezil 22, 23, galantamine 24, or tacrine 25-28 have been developed. Other approaches have focused on molecules designed to interact with key parts of the AChE enzyme binding site, like the peripheral anionic site (PAS) 29, 30.

Another strategy is to use computational approaches to identify AChE inhibitors. These have included structure-based pharmacophore modeling 31, machine learning 32, molecular docking 33-35, 2D and 3D similarity searches 36, MIA-QSAR modeling 37, or combinations of these strategies 38-40. In this current study, we have employed a Bayesian machine learning approach with literature data, followed by a high throughput screening strategy (with the eel enzyme) for the identification of new AChE inhibitors and finally a docking approach to visualize the interactions with the most promising inhibitor identified. We have discovered that the antiviral tilorone displays potent AChE inhibition for both the eel (IC50 = 14.4 nM) and human (average IC50 = 64.4 nM) enzymes. Our docking experiments showed that this inhibition is likely due to active-site interactions similar to that of donepezil, particularly with W286 in the PAS. The results of this study may also be important from both a drug discovery and toxicological perspective as we search for drugs to address pesticide and nerve agent poisoning 41.

EXPERIMENTAL

Chemicals and reagents

Tilorone dihydrochloride (Item No. 17868) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) The MicroSource Spectrum screening compound library (MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc., Gaylordsville, CT, USA) was a generous gift from Dr. Ethan Perlstein, (Perlara).

Assay Central®

Assay Central® is software developed from open source descriptors and algorithms 42, 43 combined with additional proprietary scripts that have been previously described and applied 44-53. Structure-activity datasets were collated in Molecular Notebook (Molecular Materials Informatics, Inc. in Montreal, Canada) and are thoroughly curated to generate a Bayesian machine learning model with multiple scripts. We employed a series of rules to detect problematic data, corrections were implemented by a combination of automated and human re-curation for structure standardization. This approach produces a high-quality dataset and a Bayesian model to predict activities for proposed compounds. These Bayesian models utilize extended-connectivity fingerprints of maximum diameter 6 (ECFP6) descriptors generated from the Chemistry Development Kit library 54. These descriptors have widely been noted for their ability to map structure-activity relationships 42. From all training set molecules, the Assay Central® software enumerates all fingerprints from the training set and determines a given fingerprint’s contribution to a binary activity classification from the ratio of its presence in active and inactive molecules. Assay Central® uses the summation of these contributions for a given molecule to produce a probability-like score. Metrics such as Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC), Recall, Precision, F1 Score, Cohen’s Kappa and Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient are generated from internal five-fold cross-validation of the model. To maximize these internal performance statistics, the software can select a reasonable activity threshold, and generate predictions as well as applicability scores for any desired compound. Higher prediction scores are desirable as scores higher than 0.5 are assigned to active compounds (inhibitors). Higher applicability scores are also desirable as it ensures the representation of the drug in the training set 42. Assay Central® has been used in various drug discovery projects and the applicability of the model statistics have also been previously described 44-52, 55.

Curation of training datasets

All three Bayesian models built in this study were based on ChEMBL datasets using IC50 data for ChEMBL 220 (human AChE), ChEMBL 4078 (Electrophorus electricus (eel) AChE), and ChEMBL 1914 (human butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE)). Any molecules that did not contain IC50 data were removed from the training set. Any salts or minor components were removed through a feature of AssayCentral® that allows for the retention of major components only. AssayCentral® was also used to calculate the threshold of the human BuChE and AChE models while a threshold of 100 nM was manually set for the eel AChE model as it provided a reasonable number of actives.

“Subvalidations”

The performance of the human and eel AChE models in predicting the AChE experimental data (see below) was assessed through external cross-validation metrics termed “Subvalidations.” Any compounds that overlapped between the training and testing sets were removed from the testing set, resulting in a 4545-compound test set for AChE eel and a 4601-compound test set for human AChE. The threshold of activity for these test sets were set at 50% inhibition. ROC, precision, recall and specificity metrics were used to compare the results of these subvalidations with an external test set.

Comparison between additional machine learning algorithms

The extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECPF6) molecular descriptor that Assay Central™ utilizes was also exploited by multiple machine learning algorithms to build models for the eel and human AChE and human BuChE. These additional algorithms included random forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, support vector classification, naïve Bayesian, AdaBoosted decision trees, and deep learning. Further details of these machine learning methods and their implementation have been reported previously by us and others 49, 50, 53. As described previously deep learning models were generated with Keras (https://keras.io) and a Tensorflow (www.tensorflow.org, GPU for training) backend, and all other algorithms used Scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/, CPU for training) machine learning python library. All these algorithms utilize extended-connectivity fingerprints of maximum diameter 6 generated from RDKit (http://www.rdkit.org), and were also subjected to five-fold cross-validation. A single set of hyperparameters was utilized for deep learning, as determined in previous studies 49, 50.

Activity assays

Eel AChE assays

A total of 2558 compounds from The MicroSource Spectrum Collection (MicroSource Discovery Systems, Inc., Gaylordsville, CT, USA) were tested in a single-point format at an initial concentration of 20 μM using the Amplex® Red Acetylcholine/Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, A12217). 127 molecules were excluded from the final analyses due to the appearance of poor solubility (precipitation) in the library, leading to unknown concentrations. Enzymatic reactions consisted of 50 μM acetylcholine, 200 μM Amplex Red reagent, 1 U/mL horseradish peroxidase, 0.1 U/mL choline oxidase and 0.096 U/mL acetylcholinesterase, with 1% DMSO. Reactions were performed in black 384-well plates (Corning, 3820), incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes, and read on a SpectraMax iD5 with an excitation/emission pair of 560/590 nm. Control reactions lacking acetylcholinesterase but containing 5 μM H2O2 in the presence of compounds were analyzed at the same wavelength to exclude compounds that display assay interference. Dose-response curves were then performed in duplicate.

Human AChE assays

Tilorone (hydrochloride) was tested for human AChE activity using the AChE Inhibitor Screening Kit (Colorimetric) (BioVision, K197-100). Reactions were performed in a total volume of 100 μL. Briefly, 2.5 μL of 1:50 diluted enzyme and 2.5 μL 1:12 diluted substrate were used per reaction. with 1% DMSO in 384-well clear plates (Greiner BioOne, 781162). Kinetic reactions were recorded for 40 minutes at room temp using a SpectraMax iD5 and an absorbance of 412 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated by choosing two time points in the linear range of the reaction for the positive control (PC), and comparing the slope of the reaction (slope = (OD2-OD1)/(t2-t1)) to the slope of a reaction containing sample compound (S): % Relative inhibition = (SlopePC – SlopeS)/SlopePCx100.

Secondary testing of tilorone against human AChE was performed by Eurofins Discovery (Eurofins Cerep SA, Le Bois L'évêque, France), using a photometric assay employing acetylthiocholine as a substrate for AChE to produce thiocholine, which reacts with 5:5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate to produce the yellow product 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid 56.

Human BuChE assay

Tilorone was tested for BuChE activity using the Butyrylcholinesterase Activity Kit (Colorimetric) (BioVision, K516). Reactions were performed in 384-well plates (Greiner BioOne, 781162) with 1% DMSO, according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a few modifications. Compounds were incubated with enzyme for 30 minutes at room temperature before addition of substrate. Total volume of the reaction was 100 μL, we use 5 μL enzyme and kinetic reactions were performed at 30°C for 60 minutes using a SpectraMax iD5 and an absorbance of 412 nm. Percent activity was calculated by calculating the slope of each reaction as stated above and comparing the positive control (PC) to sample (S): % Relative activity = SlopeS/SlopePCx100. We also evaluated if assay reagents could interfere with the absorbance by adding compound or DMSO to a 150 μM solution of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid and measuring at 412 nM.

Docking

Tilorone was docked in the human AChE crystal structure (PDB code 4EY7). The docking sphere was centralized from the position of the crystallized ligand donepezil with a diameter of 9.85 Å. CHARMm based docking (CDOCKER) 57 was used to generate a maximum of 10 poses of tilorone within this sphere using rigid docking. CDOCKER, a simulated annealing-based docking algorithm, was run within Discovery Studio (Biovia, San Diego, CA) using the following default parameters: 1000 dynamic steps, which included electrostatic interactions, 2000 heating steps, 5000 cooling steps and a final cooling target temperature of 300K. The calculated pKa’s for tilorone using ChemAxon software (Budapest, Hungary) had values of 9.49 and 8.88 for the protonatable nitrogens. Assuming a pH ~7.4 this would lead to a 98.13% and 99.19% for these nitrogens, respectively, therefore we decided to concentrate on the docking of the protonated state of tilorone only. The energy of the top scoring CDOCKER pose (CDOCKER interaction energy score = 62.99) was calculated to be −135.028 kcal/mol using the default setting in Discovery Studio. As a reference, the binding energy for donepezil was calculated to be −63.491 kcal/mol. The calculated pKa for the protonatable nitrogen for donepezil was 9.12 (ChemAxon), therefore it was also considered only in a protonated state. It is noted that donepezil interacts with a crystallographic water, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with Y337 and Y341, so this interaction with water was included to calculate the total interaction energy. In order to generate a CDOCKER score for the control, donepezil was docked in the same sphere and the score with the lowest RMSD (0.304 Å) from the crystalized ligand had a CDOCKER interaction energy score of 59.194.

Safety profiling

Safety profiling of tilorone was performed by Eurofins Discovery (Eurofins Cerep SA, Le Bois L'évêque, France) using the SafetyScreen44 panel of in vitro pharmacology assays to assess binding or uptake of tilorone by 44 different targets of interest, including selected kinases, GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and other non-kinase enzymes. This was performed at a final concentration of 1 μM for tilorone.

Kinase profiling

Kinase profiling was performed by ThermoFisher (Life Technologies Corporation, Chicago, IL 60693) using Z’Lyte 58, Adapta 59 and LanthaScreen 60 assays for 485 purified kinases.

Statistics

Statistical analysis for dose-response curves was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA 92108). A non-linear regression log(inhibitor) versus. response equation with three or four parameters was used (indicated in legend), and the Hill slopes for each of the graphs reported.

RESULTS

Machine Learning Models

The threshold of activity for the eel AChE Bayesian model was manually set to be 100 nM resulting in a model with 4545 compounds and 1812 active molecules, representing a well-balanced model. Internal five-fold cross-validation statistics were excellent and resulted in values for ROC, precision, recall, and specificity were 0.923, 0.810, 0.870, and 0.865 respectively (Figure 1A). The human AChE Bayesian model was built with 4601 compounds, 2226 of which were active and had a calculated threshold of 1.98 μM and represents a well-balanced model. Internal five-fold cross-validation statistics were excellent and resulted in values of 0.911, 0.800, 0.872, 0.795 for ROC, precision, recall and specificity respectively (Figure 1B). The human BuChE model was smaller based on IC50 data from 2496 compounds with only 508 active compounds and a calculated threshold of 112 nM, however, the internal validation metrics were also excellent with internal five-fold cross-validation statistics were excellent and resulted in values ROC of 0.938, precision of 0.619, recall of 0.904, and specificity of 0.858 (Figure 1C).

Comparison between additional machine learning algorithms

We observed very similar 5-fold cross validation model statistics across machine learning models for the three enzyme datasets when using either Assay Central®, random forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, support vector classification, naïve Bayesian, AdaBoosted decision trees, and deep learning (Figure S1). This suggested our selection and use of the Bayesian algorithm was on a par with other methods.

We initially used our Assay Central® Bayesian machine learning models generated with ChEMBL data to predict potential AChE inhibitors from the MicroSource Spectrum collection; a library composed of 8 plates containing 320 compounds each. Initially, we performed an activity screen on the plate with the largest number of compounds with best predicted AChE activity, however none of the compounds reached the 50% inhibition threshold we set for activity. Therefore, we then screened the remaining compounds in the library, discarding those compounds that displayed solubility issues and now report the results below.

Eel AChE screen

Through the high throughput screen of 2431 compounds, we identified 66 compounds that were “active” against eel AChE, as defined by our cutoff of inhibiting enzyme activity ≥ 50% at 20 μM (Figure 2). The average signal to background ratio of 8.49 ± 1.10 and an average Z’ of 0.91 ± 0.03 (Figure S2). Most of these hits were known inhibitors of AChE, but seven of these compounds are to our knowledge novel: agelasine, dequalinium chloride, cetylpyridinium, rifaximin, bezedoxifene acetate, and tilorone. Since AChE is a very well-studied target, the likelihood of finding new inhibitors amongst well-known drugs and molecules is unlikely. We therefore tested these inhibitors for assay interference, by performing dose-response curves with compounds in the presence of the reaction product, H2O2. Agelasine, dequalinium chloride and tilorone appeared to show a dose-response reaction to the enzyme without a corresponding dip in an enzyme-free H2O2 reaction, therefore these likely represent true inhibition of the enzyme (Figure S3). Analysis of these data revealed three compounds with IC50 values in the sub-micromolar to low micromolar range (Figure 3). Tilorone was the most potent of these, with an IC50 of 14.4 nM for the eel acetylcholinesterase.

Human AChE in vitro assays

We next investigated the ability of tilorone to inhibit human AChE initially using a colorimetric AChE inhibition assay. Tilorone showed an IC50 of 73.3 nM against the human AChE, which was less potent than the well-known FDA approved and potent AChE inhibitor donepezil (Figure 4A). This activity was also verified through testing by a third-party (Eurofins Discovery), which reported an IC50 of 56 nM for tilorone (Figure 4B), which was ten times more potent than the IC50 of 580 nM reported for another FDA-approved drug galantamine used as a positive control for this assay (data not shown). A new stock of tilorone was purchased for these and all subsequent assays. Agelasine was not further evaluated as the compound in the MicroSource Spectrum Library was a mixture of isomers and could not be purchased as individual isomers. Dequalinium chloride was commercially available but had poor solubility and was not pursued further.

AChE has a “sister” cholinesterase, BuChE, that also hydrolyzes acetylcholine and shares 51.6% amino acid sequence identity with AChE 61. To investigate this specificity, we tested tilorone against human BuChE. Compared to rivastigmine and physostigmine, tilorone was a very weak inhibitor of BuChE, displaying only 50% inhibition at 100 μM, this was statistically significant, as were comparisons of either of the positive controls with tilorone (Figure 4C). There was no significant difference between rivastigmine and physostigmine. A control with compound and buffer showed that this signal was not due to absorbance of tilorone at 412 nM (Figure S4).

Validating Assay Central® models

The screening data generated for the eel AChE was used as external test set for the eel and human Assay Central® Machine learning models generated from published data. The ROC plots show the performance of the models in predicting the eel experimental data. The external five-fold cross-validation metrics are very similar with slightly better ROC for the eel AChE model (0.647 vs. 0.581, Figure S5). We would ideally prefer ROC values &gt; 0.7. These results suggest that the human AChE does as well as the eel model in predicting the data and may be indicative of similarities between the proteins.

Docking

We docked tilorone into recombinant human acetylcholinesterase (rhAChE) using the scaffold of rhAChE crystallized with donepezil (Figure 5A, PDB code 4EY7). Like donepezil, tilorone appears to inhibit AChE activity through occupation of the majority of the active site gorge, and perhaps also through similar interactions with W286 in the peripheral anionic site (Figure 5B, 5C). Unlike donepezil, however, it appears that tilorone may display pi-interactions with Y341 through is core ring structure (Figure S5). It is important to note that since we docked this using a donepezil-bound crystal structure, the “swinging gate” of Y341 is in the open conformation for this simulation. Donepezil is 30 times more selective for AChE than BuChE 62, and if tilorone is inhibiting AChE activity using a similar mechanism, it would follow that tilorone would also not inhibit BuChE. One of the crucial interactions for BuChE inhibition is with W82 63 (W86 human AChE numbering), an interaction that the crystal structure of donepezil shows, but docking studies do not suggest for tilorone (Figure 5D, 5E).

Safety screening

In vitro safety pharmacology profiling was performed for tilorone (Eurofins Discovery) using the SafetyScreen44™ panel. This panel included 38 binding assays and six functional assays of well-established targets and pathways that lead to off-target adverse drug reactions. We tested tilorone at 1 μM against these targets and it was found to only inhibit one target &gt;50% activity, namely human acetylcholinesterase (Table S1).

Kinase screening

To further illustrate the lack of promiscuity for tilorone, we screened it at 1 μM in the SelectScreen kinase profiling panel of 485 purified kinases and interestingly did not identify any inhibition &gt;50% activity (Table S2).

DISCUSSION

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions and synapses in the autonomic and central nervous systems. It also functions as a signaling molecule in non-neuronal contexts related to cellular functions, such as proliferation and differentiation, as well as performing organ functions, like wound healing in skin or mucus production in lungs 64. The cholinergic hypothesis of AD argues that the cognitive decline associated with the disease is due to the gradual loss of these cholinergic neurons, and three of the five FDA-approved treatments for AD are cholinesterase inhibitors. There is also some evidence that AChE may help in aβ plaque assembly, through binding to the PAS 15.

In this study, we employed a machine learning approach with literature data followed by a high throughput screening strategy for the detection of AChE inhibitors and then a docking approach to visualize the molecular interactions with the most promising inhibitor identified. We were able to generate Bayesian machine learning models for eel and human AChE using literature data along with Assay Central® or alternative machine learning algorithms. These models were used to score compounds in various commercial libraries. In order to further test these models, we screened the 2558 compounds from the MicroSource library against the eel AChE and in the process identified several novel inhibitors of eel AChE. One of these novel inhibitors was tilorone, an antiviral molecule that is approved for use in several countries as an antiviral 65. This molecule inhibited eel and human AChE with an IC50 of 14.4 nM and 64.6 nM (average), respectively. Several other molecules were identified in this study including agelasine, which has previously been indirectly reported as inhibitory as it is found in the extract from the sponge Agelas marmarica which showed direct inhibition of AChE66. It should be noted that eel and human AChE machine learning models generated from literature data in ChEMBL were able to show greater than random ROC values for the test set (Figure S5). The remaining 5-fold cross validation statistics were less impressive, but this is perhaps not surprising due to the heterogeneous source of the underlying data from many different laboratories. Using the eel screening data to test the AChE human model may also show the similar structure activity relationships between them.

The central tricyclic structure of tilorone has some similarity to tacrine, the first AChE inhibitor approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease, which is a very simple molecule with a three-ring planar structure (Table S2). Due to its hepatotoxicity, tacrine was removed from the market in 1998; however, many groups in the interim have tried to recapitulate the clinical effects of tacrine without the toxicity by creating derivatives based on the three-ring core 25, 67. While the fluorenone core of tilorone resembles the three planar rings of tacrine, we were curious to see if the anti-AChE activity of tilorone was also reliant on its core structure alone. This does not appear to be the case, as neither fluorenone, nor the close derivative 2,7-dihydroxy-9H-fluoren-9-one inhibit AChE activity (Table S3). In contrast, two antimalarial molecules quinacrine and pyronaridine that roughly share the three planar rings of tacrine displayed &gt;50% inhibition at 20 μM. This planar three ring core alone is hence not sufficient for AChE inhibition as the organosulfur lucanthone did not show appreciable activity. The basic tertiary amines on tilorone (and donepezil) may be more important features related to the AChE inhibition.

Tilorone is sold under the names Lavomax or Amixin and is a small molecule antiviral medication that is approved for use outside of the United States 68. Tilorone has also been shown to have anti-cancer properties 69, which have been attributed to the planar ring structure and the ability to intercalate DNA at very high concentrations 70. In recent years, tilorone was discovered by our group to be a potent inhibitor of Ebola virus infection in mice, possibly by binding to the viral glycoprotein or through de-acidification of the lysosomal environment required for viral replication 71-73. Tilorone is also an agonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) 74, 75. α7 nAChR is the most widely expressed nicotinic subunit in the CNS, where most of the nicotinic receptors are found on the pre-synaptic membrane and regulate the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine, glutamate, GABA, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine 76. This would make it of particular interest in AD, where α7 nAChR activation by acetylcholine is hampered by binding of aβ to the receptor and agonists are under investigation as therapeutics 77, 78. Tilorone was also reported as an inducer of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 and was active against stroke and spinal cord injury suggesting activity in the central nervous system 79. There are, however, safety concerns associated with tilorone. It was shown to be an interferon inducer in mice 80, a quality that may explain some of its potent antiviral properties. It was also shown to induce keratopathy in humans when applied to the cornea, and recent investigations into the lysosomotropic nature of tilorone propose the question of lipidosis 81, 82. The synthesis of novel tilorone analogs may be one way to overcome any safety limitations. Pharmacological safety profiling of tilorone however showed no interaction between tilorone and 43 of the most common targets of drug off-target adverse reactions when tested at 1 μM (Table S1) or 485 kinase targets (Table S2) suggesting that it is not an inhibitor of kinases or promiscuous.

In order to gain insights into how tilorone displays selective inhibition for AChE over BuChE, we performed docking experiments with tilorone in AChE. AChE is a very fast enzyme, catalyzing the hydrolysis of approximately 25,000 molecules per second, at roughly the speed of diffusion 1. A possible explanation for the speed of AChE catalysis is the binding of acetylcholine first to a peripheral anionic site comprised of five hydrophobic residues at the entrance to a 20 Å deep, narrow gorge leading to the enzyme catalytic site 83. This gorge itself contains fourteen aromatic residues, and the catalytic site is comprised of two separate binding sites for acetylcholine: the anionic site, which binds the quaternary nitrogen, and the esterase site, where the hydrolysis of acetylcholine takes place 1. The catalytic triad of human AChE, consisting of ser203, his447 and glu334 (human AChE numbering), is also present in BuChE 84; however, the active site gorges differ greatly in size. A direct comparison between the human BuChE and AChE from Torpedo californicus showed the BuChE gorge to be ~200 Å larger than the AChE 85. The BuChE gorge also lacks six of the aromatic residues found in the AChE gorge, which are important for the specificity of AChE ligand binding 86, 87. BuChE is a closely related enzyme that is most abundant in plasma and can “scavenge” toxic esters like neurotoxic organophosphates that would otherwise inhibit AChE, as well as larger ligands like cocaine 88. It is also of interest as a potential drug target in AD therapy because of its increased role in the brain as AChE levels drop 89. Despite this overlapping function, there are enough differences between the enzymes to allow for specific inhibition of each. For example, rivastigmine is a dual inhibitor of AChE and BuChE, while galantamine and donepezil are selective AChE inhibitors 90. While tilorone also inhibited human AChE, this activity did not extend to the paralog BuChE as it inhibited only at high concentrations and to a lesser extent than known BuChE inhibitors (Figure 4). Molecular docking of tilorone into human AChE suggests it likely inhibits activity by occupying the active-site gorge in a manner that is very similar to donepezil. Specifically, the W86 of the PAS of AChE, that is important for donepezil binding and which seems to exhibit pi-pi interactions with tilorone, is missing in BuChE (Figure S6) 84, 91.

In conclusion, there are few AChE inhibitors that are FDA approved for treatment of AD or other neurological diseases. The discovery of new AChE inhibitors or repurposing of existing drugs may be an important route to broadening therapeutic options. In this case we have identified tilorone that is not FDA approved in the USA but is available in other countries over the counter where it is used as a prophylactic antiviral. Future research will involve testing the in vivo efficacy of tilorone in diseases that require inhibition of AChE, such as AD, use as a treatment for pesticide or other AChE exposure as well as further evaluating the structure activity relationship by testing analogs. As we have extensive maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics and animal in vivo data for tilorone, we may be well placed for such studies 65, 68, 92. The ready accessibility of tilorone and decades of experience of its use for other indications may facilitate its potential for repurposing as an AChE inhibitor and reinvigorate interest in this molecule that was originally developed in the USA 92. The availability of the machine learning models may also enable us to use them prospectively to identify molecules that may have toxicity mediated through this target.

Figure 2. A screen for inhibitors of eel acetylcholinesterase reveals novel inhibitors.

2421 compounds from the MicroSource Spectrum compound screening library were screened for activity in vitro using the Amplex® Red Acetylcholine/Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit. Activity was defined as ≥50% inhibition of enzyme activity compared to DMSO control. The compounds marked in blue were known inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, while the compounds marked in red, including cetylpyridinium, bezedoxifene acetate, rifaximin, tilorone and agelasine, were not previously described as inhibitors.

Figure 3. Dose-response of three novel inhibitors for eel acetylcholinesterase.

Sixteen-point serial dilutions beginning at 100 μM were performed for agelasine (n=2), dequalinium chloride (n=4), and tilorone (n=4) using the Amplex© Red Acetylcholinesterase Assay Kit. Reactions were normalized to enzyme with 1% DMSO (0% inhibition) and buffer reaction with no enzyme (100 % inhibition). IC50 values were generated in Prism using a non-linear regression log(inhibitor) vs. response equation with four parameters. The Hill slope for each compound are: agelasine = 0.79, dequalinium chloride = 0.87, tilorone = 0.62.

Figure 4. Selective Inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase by tilorone.

A) Dose-response curves of known and novel inhibitors of human AChE, using the BioVision colorimetric Human AChE activity assay. A two-fold, 16-point serial dilution was tested for each compound (n=2), beginning at 20 μM. IC50 curves were generated using non-linear regression log(inhibitor) vs. response equation with four parameters in Prism 8, with constraints at the top (100) and bottom (0) of the curves. The Hill slopes for each curve are tilorone = 0.84 and donepezil = 0.74. B) Secondary in vitro inhibition analysis of tilorone. A two-fold serial dilution of tilorone beginning at 5 μM was performed and tested for inhibition using photometric analysis by Eurofins Discovery. Results were given as % Inhibition of Control Values (n=2), and curves was re-created in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 using the following supplied values: IC50 = 56 nM, Top = 99, Bottom = −7, Hill slope = 1.0. Error bars representing standard deviation are too small be shown on graph. C) Single-point determination of the inhibitory effect of 100 μM tilorone on human BuChE compared to known inhibitors physostigmine and rivastigmine tartrate (n=2). The percent activity of the enzymatic reactions is based upon a positive control of BuChE and 1% DMSO. Tukey’s multiple comparison tests were performed. 100μM physiostigmine vs 100μM rivastigmine tartrate (ns, Adjusted P value &gt;0.99), 100μM physiostigmine vs 100μM tilorone (**, Adjusted P value 0.0021), 100μM physiostigmine vs DMSO (***, Adjusted P value 0.0001), 100μM rivastigmine tartrate vs 100μM tilorone (**, Adjusted P value 0.0021), rivastigmine tartrate vs DMSO (***, Adjusted P value 0.0001) and 100μM tilorone vs DMSO (***, Adjusted P value 0.0009).
