Introduction:

Large longitudinal biomarkers database focusing on middle age is needed for AD prevention.

Methods:

Data for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, molecular imaging of cerebral fibrillar β-amyloid with positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain structures, and clinical/cognitive outcomes were harmonized across eight AD biomarker studies. Statistical power was estimated.

Results:

The harmonized database included 7779 participants with clinical/cognitive data: 3542 were 18~65 years at baseline, 5865 had longitudinal cognitive data for a median of 4.7 years 2473 participated in the CSF studies (906 had longitudinal data), 2496 participated in the MRI studies (1283 had longitudinal data), and 1498 participated in the PET amyloid studies (849 had longitudinal data). The database provides adequate power for detecting early biomarker changes, and demonstrates the feasibility of AD prevention trials on middle-aged individuals.

Conclusions:

The harmonized database is an optimum resource to design AD prevention trials decades prior to symptomatic onset.

1. Background

Accumulating research suggests that the neuropathological processes of Alzheimer disease (AD) begin decades prior to symptom onset [1-4]. The natural history of this long asymptomatic phase, termed preclinical AD, is important to understand because it likely offers an optimal time window for prevention trials of anti-AD therapies. Because individuals in the preclinical stage of AD have no (or minimal) cognitive impairment, biomarkers of different modalities are important for tracking the progression of preclinical AD. To date, most human biomarker studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based regional brain volumes, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analytes, and molecular imaging of cerebral fibrillar β-amyloid with positron emission tomography (PET) using the [11 C] benzothiazole tracer, Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB), have been focused on either elderly individuals older than 65 years or those who are already symptomatic. This age window, however, may very likely miss the crucial interval during which the neuropathophysiological processes of AD are initiated [5-6]. To fully understand the natural history of AD from the preclinical to symptomatic stages and the temporal orderings of pathological changes in the brain, a high-quality and longitudinal biomarker database of individuals younger than 65 years, preferably starting from young adulthood, is necessary. Analyses of high-quality longitudinal AD biomarker data are also crucial for participant recruitment from secondary prevention trials to primary prevention trials of AD [7-8].

This study describes the development of a large database on individuals 18~65 years old at baseline, as well as those older than 65 years with and without AD dementia, by harmonizing cross-sectional and longitudinal data on CSF biomarkers, PET amyloid imaging markers, MRI structure measures, and clinical/cognitive outcomes collected from eight high-quality longitudinal biomarkers studies of AD. This study further assesses the statistical power of the harmonized data in detecting early changes of biomarkers and in designing future AD prevention trials.

2. Methods

2.1. Participants

Participants are from eight ongoing longitudinal biomarker studies of AD: the Washington University (WU) Adult Children Study (ACS), the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Biomarkers for Older Controls at Risk for Dementia (BIOCARD) Study, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study, the WU Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), the WU Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD) program project, and the WU Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Wisconsin ADRC (WADRC). All studies have focused primarily on the asymptomatic phase of AD, and/or recruited young and middle-aged participants at risk for AD and followed longitudinally with assessments of AD biomarkers, cognition and everyday function. All participants have given written informed consent, and agreed to data sharing. The protocol of the current study is approved by the Institutional Review Board of WU School of Medicine.

A summary of participant recruitment, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and specific aims for all eight studies is in Table 1. Briefly, the WU ACS [9] has enrolled community-dwelling volunteers aged 43 to 75 year since 2004, stratified by both family history (FH) for late-onset AD and ages at baseline (43-54, 55-64, 65-75 years). Eligibility criteria are cognitive normality at baseline (defined as a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR, [10]) of 0), and willingness to complete all biomarker study procedures. Exclusion criteria include conditions that would preclude biomarker assessments and/or confound cognitive assessment or membership in families with a known causative mutation for AD. Individuals are assessed every two years for cognition, CSF, and imaging (amyloid PET and MRI) biomarkers until symptom onset and then annually for cognition; participants age 65 years or older are assessed annually for cognition. The WU Knight ADRC and its affiliated program project, Healthy Aging and Senile Dementia (HASD), were established in 1985 and 1984, respectively, and have since enrolled volunteers mostly older than 65 years. The WU ADRC and HASD implement identical research protocols as the ACS for clinical assessments, CSF and imaging procedures [11]. The cognitive battery of the WU ADRC and HASD is not identical to that of the ACS, but overlaps significantly. A total of 3131 participants from the WU ACS, ADRC, and HASD are included in the database.

The BIOCARD study [12], initiated in 1995 at the National Institutes of Health(NIH), enrolls cognitively normal (CN) middle age individuals. About three-quarters of the participants have a first-degree relative with AD dementia. The study was stopped in 2005 and re-initiated at JHU in 2009. Since then, the annual visits have included a neuropsychological battery, history of symptom onset, CDRs, a physical and neurological examination, medication use, and behavioral and mood assessments, similar to what were given at the NIH. MRI scans and CSF were collected approximately every 2 years while the study was at the NIH. A total of 318 CN participants at baseline who were re-enrolled in 2009 are included in the database.

WRAP enrolls CN volunteers with a FH of probable AD dementia starting late 2001 and those without FH starting in 2004 [13]. Participants are predominantly aged 40-65 years with good health. Participation includes baseline, four years later and then serial visits every two years with clinical/cognitive assessments, medical condition, and lifestyle histories. The WADRC enrolls both CN individuals and those with AD dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI, [14]), and a similar middle-aged cohort to WRAP for enrollment in prevention trials. Biomarker data including CSF, MRI, PET PIB of amyloid imaging are acquired from subsets of participants in the WRAP and the WADRC. A total of 2385 participants from the WRAP (n=1555) and the WADRC (n=830) are included in the database.

The AIBL study [15] was initiated in 2006 by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific Industrial and Research Organization. It enrolls volunteers age 55 years or older and excludes individuals with a history of comorbidities which could affect cognition. Initial assessment classifies individuals as CN, MCI, or AD dementia, and further by the CDR. Longitudinal assessments occur at 18-month intervals, including an extensive cognitive battery, CSF biomarkers, health/lifestyle characteristics, medical history and medication use. A subset of participants undergo amyloid PET PIB and MRI imaging. A total of 1441 participants from the AIBL are included in the database.

The DIAN, launched in 2008, is an international registry of adult children (≥18 years) of individuals who had a highly penetrant mutation for AD in amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 or 2 [16]. The DIAN enrolls CN and symptomatic mutation carriers and non-carrier family members as controls. Participants are assessed longitudinally with clinical and cognitive batteries, MRI structural and PET amyloid imaging protocols, and CSF collection. Asymptomatic individuals are assessed every two years, but annually if they are within three years of their estimated parental age of symptom onset. Symptomatic participants are annually evaluated unless cognitive decline prevents participation. A total of 504 participants from the DIAN are included in the database.

2.2. Harmonization of Clinical and Cognitive Data

The clinical assessment protocols of all eight studies are largely consistent with that of the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set (UDS) [17], which include standard diagnostic criteria for detection of dementia and its differential diagnosis [18]. The presence or absence of dementia and, when present, its severity are operationalized with the CDR by all studies. Individuals in the AIBL, BIOCARD and WRAP and WADRC studies are classified as CN, MCI, and AD dementia by a clinical review panel. However, across studies, the designation of MCI is inconsistent. Hence, a common definition of MCI is adopted, based on a published algorithm that requires a CDR of 0.5 and either at least two memory test scores or at least two non-memory test scores one standard deviation (SD) below the age-adjusted mean [19].

The individual cognitive batteries were detailed in Xiong et al. [9] for WU ACS, Ellis et al. [15] for AIBL, Albert et al. [12] for BIOCARD, and Johnson et al. [13] and Dowling et al. [20] for WRAP and WADRC, Morris et al. [11] for WU HASD and ADRC, and Storandt et al. [21] for DIAN. All include tests of episodic memory, semantic knowledge, working memory, executive function/attention, visuospatial ability, speed of processing, psychomotor speed, and general cognition. Most cognitive tests are shared by at least two studies and included in the harmonized database (see Supplemental Table 1), e.g., the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), California Verbal Learning Test, Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)-III or WMS-R Logical Memory I and II, WMS-III or WMS-R Verbal Paired Associates I and II, Boston Naming Test, Trailmaking Tests A &amp; B, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III or WAIS-R Digit Span &amp; Digit Symbol, Letter-number sequencing, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Vocabulary &amp; Similarities, Block design), the Stroop task, Free &amp; Cued Selective Reminding, Clock Drawing, Benton Line Orientation, Rey Complex Figure Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Letter and Category Fluency (CFL), and Animal Naming (60 sec) [9,11-13,15,20-21]. A cognitive composite is created using Logical Memory Delayed Recall, Boston Naming, Animal Fluency, MMSE, and WAIS-R Digit Symbol, by averaging the z-scores using the overall means(SD) from the raw baseline scores.

2.3. CSF Collection, Processing, and Database Harmonization

The WU ACS, ADRC, HASD, and WRAP/WADRC collect CSF at 8 a.m. after overnight fasting. Samples are gently inverted to avoid possible gradient effects, briefly centrifuged at low speed, and aliquoted into polypropylene tubes prior to freezing at −80°C [22]. CSF samples from the WU ACS, ADRC, and HASD are analyzed for total tau (Tau), and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (Ptau), and Aβ1-42 (Aβ42) by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (INNOTEST; Fujirebio, Malverne, PA ). BIOCARD, AIBL, and DIAN collect and analyze the CSF specimens similar to the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, [23]) protocol, i.e., using the xMAP-based AlzBio3 kit (Fujirebio, Malverne, PA ) run on the Bioplex 200 system. Details for BIOCARD CSF analysis were described previously [24]. The WRAP and WADRC use the same CSF protocol as described in [25], and all samples have been processed by Henrik Zetterberg and Kaj Blennow, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, also using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. Given that variations in CSF collections and analyte assays may affect the analyses of CSF biomarkers, variables on CSF collections and analyte assays are added in the integrated database to allow sensitivity and adjusted analyses. Additionally, CSF samples in WU ACS, HASD, ADRC, and DIAN have been re-processed with the same Elecsys® immunoassays on the automated Roche cobas e 601 analyzer [26].

2.4. MRI and PET Brain Imaging and Database Harmonization

MRI and PET imaging with PIB for the AIBL study are detailed in [27]. 3D T1 (Siemens 1.5T and 3T scanners) Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) and a T2 turbospin echo and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence MRI are acquired for screening and co-registration with the PET images. For the WU ACS, ADRC, HASD, and DIAN studies, consistent protocols are implemented on 3T scanners using a 12-channel head coil equipped with parallel imaging including four major components: structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL), for a total of approximately 60 minutes of MR imaging. The MRI protocol provides high gray-white matter contrast (1mm × 1mm × 1 mm) MPRAGE T1-weighted volume acquisitions [28]. PET PIB imaging is conducted using a scanner (CTI) in a darkened, quiet room. Details are in [28]. For WRAP, the MRI and PET procedures are described in [29]. Briefly, the procedure involves a detailed 3T (GE) MRI protocol involving a T1w volume, FLAIR 3D volume, resting-state Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) scan, DTI, and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling, and a dynamic 70 min [C11] PIB PET scan. For BIOCARD, the MRI protocol at the NIH included a Fast Spin Echo Sequence, Spoiled Gradient Recalled Echo (SPGR) sequences, and FLAIR imaging collected on a 1.5 T GE scanner [30]. Starting in 2015, MRI images have been collected every other year on a Philips 3T scanner, and the protocol includes MPRAGE, FLAIR, DTI and resting BOLD sequences.

To harmonize the imaging measures, raw MRI and PIB PET scans from WU ACS, ADRC, HASD, AIBL, WRAP and WADRC are sent to WU NeuroImaging Lab for central reprocessing. Structural MRI processing steps include motion correction, if applicable, averaging across scans, and atlas transformation. Regional volumes and cortical thickness are obtained via the FreeSurfer image analysis suite (Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Charlestown, MA) [31], version 5.3. Determination of the regions-of-interest (ROIs) and pipelines are described in [28,32]. FreeSurfer quality control (QC) criteria include (1) dural inclusion, gray matter exclusion, sulcus inclusion, cerebellum inclusion; (2) cerebellum, subcortical and hippocampus segmentation exclusion; (3) white matter exclusion, and (4) lateral ventricle segmentation. Analyses are performed on adjusted volumetric measures after regressing for the effect of scanner platform and with adjustment for head size [32]. PIB amyloid deposition in the ROIs is determined using FreeSurfer, and a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with correction for partial volume effects is calculated [32]. The cerebellum is chosen as the reference region. The mean cortical SUVR is calculated from FreeSurfer regions within the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and temporal cortex [28].

2.5. Database QC, Missing Data, and Standardization

To harmonize data across studies, multiple teleconferences were held with study-specific data managers to implement final QC and standardization. Final QC includes double checks on missing data and the ranges. The final database standardization includes a uniform database dictionary, and standard codes/formats for biomarkers and cognitive tests, missing data, CSF collection/assay/lots/plates, imaging acquisition (scanners, tracers) and processing parameters, and demographics, using approaches consistent with the STRATOS initiative [33].

3. Results

3.1. The Harmonized Database

The integrated database contained 7779 participants who went through clinical and cognitive assessments and/or biomarker assessments. Table 2 presents the baseline demographics and clinical status, as a function of baseline age. Of the 7779 participants, 3542 (45.53%) were 65 years or younger at baseline, 4751 (61.07%) were female, 2987 (38.40%) were APOE4 positive, 303 carried penetrant mutations in one of three genes for AD, 4640 (59.65%) had more than 12 years of education, and 3768 (48.44%) had a family history of dementia. A total of 5172 (66.49%) participants were CDR 0 at baseline. During the longitudinal follow-up, a total of 894 participants received a CDR 0.5 (or higher) and a diagnosis of MCI or AD.

Table 2 and 3 present the amount of cross-sectional and longitudinal data on CSF, neuroimaging, and cognitive markers as a function of baseline age and CDR. A total of 5865 individuals participated in the longitudinal cognitive assessments for a median of 4.7 years. Of these, 2775 were 65 years or younger at baseline. A total of 2473 participated in the CSF studies. Of these, 1358 were 65 years or younger at baseline, and 906 received longitudinal CSF assessments for a median of 3.4 years. A total of 2496 individuals participated in the MRI studies. Of these, 1324 were 65 years or younger at baseline, and 1283 received longitudinal MRI assessments for a median of 4.0 years. Finally, a total of 1498 individuals participated in the PET amyloid PIB studies. Of these, 962 were 65 years or younger at baseline, and 849 received longitudinal PET PIB assessments for a median of 3.4 years. Supplemental Table 2 presents study-specific demographics, sample size, and years of follow-up for each biomarker modality. Supplemental Table 3 presents study-specific mean (SD) for baseline PET PIB cortical mean SUVR, MRI hippocampal volume, CSF biomarkers, and a cognitive composite as a function of baseline age, suggesting largely comparable biomarker values across studies within the same age windows (and with same assay types for CSF markers).

3.2. Statistical Power to Detect Early Changes of AD

Table 4 presents the annual rates of longitudinal change for all major AD biomarkers as a function of baseline age detectable by the harmonized database with at least 80% statistical power. These power analyses excluded the 303 mutation carriers from DIAN. These power analyses assumed the same variance parameters estimated from the WU ACS in a random intercept and random slope model [34], and were based on a standard normal test for testing whether each rate of change differs from zero at a significance level of 5% [35].

3.3. Design of Future Prevention Trials

We consider a future two-arm (treatment, placebo) 1:1 primary prevention trial on individuals younger than 75 years with annual assessments of 5 years to test the efficacy on two amyloid biomarkers (PET PIB SUVR, CSF Aβ42). Table 5 presents, for each biomarker and each baseline age interval, the total sample size needed to detect 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% improvement in the rate of change for the treatment in comparison to the placebo. These power analyses were based on a standard normal test with 80% power and a significance level of 5% [35]. The annual rate of change for the placebo and the variance parameters were estimated from the WU ACS database in a random intercept and random slope model [34].

3.4. Data Sharing and Confidentiality

The integrated database is housed behind a firewall to ensure HIPPA compliancey. An internet website allows investigators to query and request the data for analyses. The website is posted on a Linux Apache web server within WU Division of Biostatistics, created with HTML, PHP URL=https://biostat.wustl.edu/adrc/test/xiong/pbs/. Investigators are required to apply for a user name and password to query the data and submit data requests. A review committee of all study principal investigators will review data requests for approval. Upon approval, data will be shared in a secure HIPPA-compliant manner. To ensure scientific rigor and reproducibility, authors of all publications using the database will be required to submit their final analysis data set and computing codes back for archive purposes.

4. Discussion

A biomarker model of AD has recently been hypothesized in which the most widely validated biomarkers of AD pathology become abnormal and progressively change in an ordered manner [1,3,16]. There is now scientific evidence that Aβ accumulation and deposition in the brain is a very early pathological process in AD, detectable by PET imaging of amyloid plaques and CSF Aβ42 concentration. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal death, and medial-temporal lobe atrophy on MRI appear to begin during the preclinical phase of AD, and by the time of early symptoms, neuronal cell death is already significant in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and layer II of the entorhinal cortex [2]. However, NFTs and neuronal cell death may not peak until the later clinical stages of AD. The acceleration of tau aggregation and neurodegeneration, detectable by increases in CSF Tau and Ptau [22,23], may mark the transition just prior to symptom onset. By the time of early symptoms, significant neuronal loss and structural changes have already occurred in the brain [1,4,16,22].

The statistical test of the hypothesized biomarker model of AD require a large and high-quality longitudinal biomarker database that focuses on the age window when the initiation of the neurodegenerative process of AD likely begins. Our earlier reports on the WU ACS alone [1, 9] and others [4, 27, 29] suggested that biomarker changes may first appear around age 50 for late-onset AD, depending on factors such as APOE4 status. Results from individual studies, however, suffer from a lack of statistical power to definitively pinpoint the earliest possible AD biomarker signatures. To our knowledge, the harmonized database represents the largest longitudinal CSF, PIB and MRI imaging dataset for asymptomatic individuals younger than 65 years. In fact, the database can allow estimates of the longitudinal rate of changes starting from 18 years, which will likely capture the very initial changes in biomarkers during the decades-long preclinical stage, and when compared across biomarkers, offer critical information about the temporal cascade of these changes. For example, the annual rates of changes detectable by the harmonized database, as presented in Table 4, are as small as 15.1 pg/mL in CSF Aβ42 and 0.008 in mean cortical PIB SUVR for individuals from 45~55 years, suggesting sufficient statistical power to detect subtle biomarker changes.

Major secondary prevention RCTs, the A4 trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02008357), the DIAN TU trials (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01760005, [7]), and the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01998841), are currently ongoing. All employ biomarkers or genetics as the subject inclusion/exclusion criteria or secondary efficacy endpoints. Primary prevention trials are currently planned, employing imaging and CSF biomarkers as the primary efficacy endpoints [8]. The harmonized database provides an optimal resource for designing such trials when mean cortical PIB SUVR or CSF Aβ42 are used as the primary efficacy endpoints. Power analyses in Table 5 indicate that prevention trials on individuals younger than 65 years are feasible.

The harmonized database also has limitations. First, the database presents unique analytic challenges regarding heterogeneity in cohort characteristics such as family history of AD and research protocols across studies. Valid statistical analyses must analyze study-to-study variation with appropriate meta-analytic models by treating studies as a fixed or random effect, and assess the heterogeneity across studies, and include important covariates such as family history of AD. Especially for CSF biomarker analysis, we recommend analyses be conducted on data obtained from the same assay type, and further adjust for the effect of variables related to CSF collection. Second, the longitudinal follow-ups in biomarkers do not capture the full spectrum of within-individual progression. Third, the large database remains a collection of convenience samples, likely not representative of the real world population. For instance, the combined cohort is predominantly well-educated Caucasians, findings from the database may not generalize to other populations.

We integrate and harmonize longitudinal biomarkers and cognitive databases from 8 high-quality longitudinal studies of AD to investigate the natural history of preclinical AD from young adulthood and to design future prevention trials;

The harmonized database provides excellent statistical power for detecting very early biomarker changes on middle age individuals;

The harmonized database demonstrates the feasibility of powering future AD prevention trials on middle age individuals.
