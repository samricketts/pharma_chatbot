Introduction:

Despite evidence for systemic mitochondrial dysfunction early in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, reliable approaches monitoring these key bioenergetic alterations are lacking. We utilized PBMCs and platelets as reporters of mitochondrial function in the context of cognitive impairment and AD.

Methods:

Mitochondrial function was analyzed using complementary respirometric approaches in intact and permeabilized cells from older adults with normal cognition, MCI, and dementia due to probable AD. Clinical outcomes included measures of cognitive function and brain morphology.

Results:

PBMC and platelet bioenergetic parameters were lowest in dementia participants. MCI platelets exhibited higher maximal respiration than normocognitives. PBMC and platelet respiration positively associated with cognitive ability and hippocampal volume, and negatively associated with white matter hyperintensities.

Discussion:

Our findings indicate blood-based bioenergetic profiling can be utilized as a minimally-invasive approach for measuring systemic bioenergetic differences associated with dementia, and may be used to monitor bioenergetic changes associated with AD risk and progression.

1.1 Contextual background

Blood-based bioenergetic profiling has emerged as a reliable, minimally-invasive approach assessing mitochondrial function in human studies. Circulating blood cells, such as platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), exhibit high rates of electron transport chain (ETC) activity and metabolic flexibility [1–3]. In circulation, these cells are continuously exposed to paracrine factors that can modulate mitochondrial function throughout the body [4]. Circulating cells have been proposed to serve as reporters of systemic bioenergetic capacity. In line with this premise, it was shown by our group and others, including Darley-Usmar and colleagues, that blood cell bioenergetics can recapitulate bioenergetic capacity of highly metabolically active tissues [1, 2, 5–11]. Respirometric profiles of PBMCs and platelets have been related to measures of brain mitochondrial function and metabolism [5, 12], and brain morphology and cognitive performance [6]. Here, we conducted highly comprehensive blood-based bioenergetic profiling to examine mitochondrial function across cognitive abilities, from normal cognition to dementia due to probable AD.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. However, the underlying causative pathophysiologies occurring early in disease development remain unclear. The amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes AD is caused by accumulation of Aβ-containing plaques and tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), supporting familial/early-onset forms of AD (EOAD) [13]. In sporadic/late-onset forms (LOAD), toxic Aβ and p-tau accumulation may not be the primary cause of neurodegeneration, and may occur downstream of other causative factors [14]. For example, the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis proposes mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the earliest hallmarks of AD, and the primary event leading to senile plaques deposition and neurofibrillary tangles [15]. While alterations in energy metabolism occur in normal aging process, people with lower mitochondrial respiration are more likely to develop AD, suggesting bioenergetic dysfunction may be a contributing mechanism underlying LOAD [16]. AD mouse models exhibit changes in brain metabolism early, often preceding amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles development [17]. Alterations in mitochondrial quality control processes (fusion, fission, autophagy) associate with neurodegeneration, specifically AD [18]; mitochondrial DNA mutations relate to cognitive function, AD status, and risk [19]. Aβ deposition is linked to mitochondrial bioenergetic alterations, e.g. depolarization, ETC uncoupling, reduced ATP production, increased reactive oxygen species generation [20]. Human and animal studies indicate AD is associated with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ accumulation on brain mitochondria, causing bioenergetic changes [21, 22].

While bioenergetic decline impacts brain due to exceptionally high metabolic demands, these effects extend to other tissues and cells, including fibroblasts and peripheral cells, in various neurological disorders [23, 24]. There is mounting evidence for peripheral mitochondrial dysfunction accompanying brain mitochondrial changes in AD. Early AD patient white blood cells show decreased mitochondrial respiratory complex I-V genes and core mitochondrial ribosome complex subunits expression compared to controls, mirroring changes in AD brains [25]. AD patients circulating lymphocytes and monocytes exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative damage [26]. Interestingly, peripheral blood cells are used as models for neuropsychiatric disorders [27, 28]. AD specific neuronal changes are studied in platelets that are shown to play an important role in AD process [29]. Evidence show platelet mitochondrial function impairment in AD patients compared to healthy age-matched controls [30]. Ongoing animal studies are exploring use of platelets for early AD diagnosis [31]. Together, these studies suggest circulating cell populations may be able to monitor AD-associated mitochondrial dysfunction.

This study builds upon current understanding of the role of mitochondria in AD pathophysiology, and significantly advances the development of affordable, minimally-invasive tools and approaches for monitoring systemic bioenergetic decline. We examine peripheral blood cell bioenergetics and relationships of these measures with cognitive performance and brain morphology in a cohort of 211 older adults representing the spectrum from normal cognition (NC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to probable AD (DEM). We report on complex and fuel-specific differences in PBMC and platelet bioenergetics using complementary high-throughput and high-resolution approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth characterization of ETC activities in older adults with NC, MCI and AD as adjudicated by multidisciplinary consensus conference. Our highly characterized cohort provides a platform for understanding cellular level metabolic changes occurring at different stages of cognitive impairment associated to AD progression.

1.2 Study conclusions and implications

Our results demonstrate that peripheral blood cells exhibit bioenergetic differences based on cognitive status. Specifically, PBMC basal, maximal, reserve, and ATP-linked bioenergetic capacities are lower in lower in DEM compared to NC and MCI. Fuel type-specific analysis using permeabilized PBMCs reveal progressive decline in FAO-mediated respiration. Smaller studies have indicated progressive mitochondrial impairment in PBMCs with cognitive decline and AD development [32]. Perturbations in unsaturated fatty acid metabolism in AD-vulnerable brain regions are shown to associate with AD pathogenesis [33], indicating lipid metabolism dyshomeostasis, that may result in abnormal brain functions characterizing disease progression [34]. Our data indicate that similar changes in fuel metabolism are apparent in peripheral PBMCs.

Interestingly, platelets from MCI participants exhibit higher maximal respiration compared to NC, with lowest respiration in DEM. Fuel type-specific respiration reveal higher fatty acid oxidation-mediated respiration (FAO) in MCI compared to NC and DEM. Our MCI cohort consists of approximately 80 percent single- and multi-domain amnestic MCI individuals (60 out of 76), who suffer from persistently higher memory problems than normal age-matched controls [35]. Studies in LOAD patients reported innate metabolic alterations resembling an inverse-Warburg effect [24, 36, 37]. Our results may indicate disease-specific bioenergetic alterations, suggesting compensatory shift from glycolysis to fatty acid β-oxidation in early stages of cognitive decline. Similar metabolic reprogramming was reported to eventually cause white matter degradation [38].

PBMC bioenergetics correlate with cognitive function and brain morphology. Specifically, maximal, reserve and FAO correlate positively with cognitive function (mPACC5). Basal, maximal, reserve, ATP-linked, FAO+CI+CII (mitochondrial complex II-specific respiration), MaxOXPHOS, and MaxETS (maximal coupled and uncoupled respiration) correlate positively with hippocampal volume (HV%). FAO+CI+CII correlates negatively with white matter hyperintensities (lnWMH). Similarly, platelet FAO positively correlates with mPACC5, while basal and ATP-linked correlate positively with HV% and negatively with lnWMH. HV% serves as a structural biomarker of AD progression while InWMH is used to report on brain lesions [39]. For the most part, associations reported here remain significant after controlling for age, BMI, and sex. Moreover, the directionality of associations with clinical outcomes are maintained across bioenergetic parameters in both cell types, suggesting these relationships are generalizable across measures, although strengths of specific correlations may differ.

ApoE4+/− genotype had no significant impact on bioenergetics in both cell types, suggesting bioenergetics is an independent contributor of AD risk, unrelated to ApoE status.

This work reports on links between peripheral blood cell bioenergetics, cognition, and AD-associated neuropathology, significantly expanding upon studies conducted in smaller cohorts and those reporting differences in mitochondrial enzymatic activities [26, 28, 39–41]. This builds on previous studies from our team that utilized blood-based bioenergetic profiling to report associations with brain architecture and cognitive performance in African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes [6], and inflammation and physical performance [40, 41]. Together, these results indicate that bioenergetic alterations contribute to common age-related conditions, providing new mechanistic insights into cellular factors linking physical and cognitive abilities of older adults [42].

Cross-sectional data presented here suggest PBMCs exhibit progressive bioenergetic decline associated with cognitive decline, while platelets exhibit potentially compensatory bioenergetic shifts with disease progression. Future longitudinal studies will determine if this is indeed the case. Studies are also required to tease apart which cell types among PBMCs are driving differences and associations reported here. Another question stemming from this study relates to factors mediating blood cell bioenergetic alterations in the context of dementia. Paracrine signaling may contribute to mitochondrial functional alterations. For example, neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) alter synaptic plasticity, play a role in neurodegenerative disorders [43], and alter mitochondrial function [44]. Our team recently showed a central role of circulating blood-borne factors in age-related bioenergetic decline [45]. Using heterochronic parabiosis model, we reported blood from older animals deleteriously affect young mice bioenergetic capacity; young and old heterochronic parabionts exhibited equalization of bioenergetic capacities, demonstrating blood is sufficient to mediate age-related bioenergetic differences. Future studies can examine whether factors mediating aging-related bioenergetic decline also underlie relationships between cognitive status and blood cell bioenergetics reported here. Various classes of circulating factors, including peptides, lipid metabolites, RNAs, cytokines are being investigated as mediators of biological aging and age-related diseases, including AD [46].

The main strength of this study is the rigorous bioenergetic profiling approach, combining high-resolution and high-throughput respirometry of two different blood cell populations. Comparison of PBMCs and platelets in a cohort of this size reveals key differences that were previously unappreciated. Furthermore, inclusion of both intact and permeabilized cell assays provide readouts of overall bioenergetic capacity, as well as respiration driven by specific fuels and ETC complexes. The main limitation is the cross-sectional design. Ongoing studies stemming from this work will provide longitudinal assessments of mitochondrial bioenergetics and will examine relationships with AD progression and cognitive decline. Another limitation is the relative lack of diversity in this study population. Similar studies in populations with diverse racial backgrounds are warranted to understand if these results hold true in all populations. This study serves as important starting point for future studies that will include longitudinal analyses in more diverse participant populations.

Blood-based bioenergetic profiling provides a feasible, affordable, and minimally-invasive approach for monitoring systemic bioenergetic changes across AD progression. As we continue to learn more about role of systemic bioenergetic decline in aging and AD, results of this study will directly impact development of blood-based screening tools for determining AD risk. As the field of mitochondrial therapeutics continues to advance, blood-based bioenergetic profiling can serve as a key outcome in clinical trials. In the future, this technique will be available for clinical use. Studies are currently underway to expand this study in diverse populations to obtain bioenergetic reference ranges across different populations, and to obtain CLIA certification.

2. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND STUDY DESIGN

This cross-sectional study examined systemic differences in mitochondrial function in AD and tested the hypothesis that peripheral blood cells can report on bioenergetic differences associated with cognitive impairment and AD pathophysiology. Our cohort was designed to identify and characterize early risk factors that can predict cognitive decline and dementia. We examined PBMC and platelet bioenergetics in 211 adults, age 55 years and older, with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia due to probable AD (DEM). We used two complementary respirometric methods: high-throughput respirometry of intact cells that used glucose as the primary fuel source, and high-resolution respirometry of permeabilized cells that sequentially used fatty acid and glucose-metabolism derived substrates. We examined relationships of mitochondrial function with cognitive abilities (measured using Modified Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite, mPACC5) and brain morphology, namely, white matter hyperintensities (lnWMH) volume and hippocampal volume (HV%) (measured using MRI).

2.1 Bioenergetics and cognitive ability

We found multiple measures of glucose and fatty acid oxidation-mediated mitochondrial respiration to be significantly lower in participants with dementia compared to normocognitive controls, including maximal glucose-dependent respiration, maximal coupled respiration, and the maximal capacity of the electron transfer system in both PBMCs and platelets. These represent maximum achievable respiration rates during periods of physiological energy demand, induced experimentally by sequentially providing specific substrates to each ETC complex, and ETC uncoupling to stimulate maximum functional capacity. PBMC FAO-mediated respiration showed progressive decline across NC, MCI, and AD participants, while platelet respiration profiles were generally highest in MCI compared to both NC and DEM.

2.2 Relationships between bioenergetics, cognitive ability and brain morphology

PBMC and platelet bioenergetics demonstrate positive relationships with mPACC5 (composite cognitive score assessing cognitive performance). Maximal and reserve capacity show significant positive association with mPACC5 in PBMCs, and FAO show significant positive association with mPACC5 in PBMCs and platelets. Neurons utilize short and medium chain fatty acids, which can cross the blood-brain barrier [47]; medium chain fatty acids are mostly obtained from dietary triglycerides [48]. To examine FAO-mediated respiration that potentially more closely related to brain metabolism, we utilized octanoylcarnitine, a medium chain fatty acid [48, 49]. PBMC and platelet bioenergetics also exhibit positive relationships with HV% (bilateral hippocampal volume expressed as percentage of total intracranial volume). PBMC basal, maximal, reserve, ATP-linked, FAO+CI+CII, MaxOXPHOS, and MaxETS correlate positively with HV%, while platelet basal and ATP-linked correlate positively with HV%. Reduced hippocampal volume is a key structural biomarker of AD progression, changing significantly over time in late MCI and early AD, and is related to learning and memory deficits [39]. PBMC and platelet bioenergetics demonstrate negative relationships with lnWMH, a measure of debilitating brain lesions associated with cognitive decline and dementia and a hallmark of AD pathology. lnWMH abnormalities are evident in early stages of AD and MCI, and are thought to cause severe cognitive deficits [50]. Our results demonstrate that systemic mitochondrial deficits occur at early stages of AD, and reveal a multifaceted interaction between systemic cellular health and cognitive health. Interestingly, ApoE4+/− genotype showed no significant impact on bioenergetics in both cell types, suggesting mitochondrial bioenergetics is an independent risk factor of AD. Our comprehensive, bioenergetic profiling approach reveal a set of bioenergetic parameters that may be predictive of cognitive decline. Studies are currently underway to examine these bioenergetic parameters and their relationships to longitudinal clinical changes.

3. DETAILED METHODS AND RESULTS

3.1 Methods

Detailed methods can be found in the supplemental information. Briefly, 211 normoglycemic participants were enrolled in the AD Clinical Core (ADCC) cohort of the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (WF ADRC) for baseline visit. All participants underwent cognitive assessments and brain MRI, and clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data were used to diagnose each participant to NC, MCI, and DEM cognitive groups following current National Institute of Aging-Alzheimer’s Association guidelines. All participants underwent UDS version 3, along with supplemental cognitive tests including Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Average z-score was computed to produce Modified Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite (mPACC5) score from five cognitive tests: MMSE, FCSRT free recall, Craft Story verbatim recall, DSST, and category fluency. White matter hyperintensity (lnWMH) volume and hippocampal volume (HV%) were obtained from brain MRIs. Overnight fasted venous blood was drawn from participants and PBMCs and platelets were isolated for high-throughput and high-resolution respirometry assays.

3.2 Results

Based on predetermined criteria described in the methods section, our cohort was comprised of NC (n = 112), MCI (n = 76), and DEM (n = 23) participants.

3.2.1 Participant characteristics

Table 1 provides the demographic information for the participants included in the study and summarizes the AD and dementia-related outcomes. Range of values, averages and standard deviation for the demographic characteristics (age, BMI, sex), mPACC5 score, lnWMH volume, HV%, and ApoE4+/− status are summarized for the entire cohort and by cognitive diagnosis. MCI and DEM groups were significantly older than participants in the NC (p = 0.04 and 0.002). Sex distribution was not equal across the cohort (82 Males, 147 Females total, p = &lt;0.000). As expected, mPACC5 scores and HV% were lower in MCI and DEM compared to NC (mPACC5: both p = &lt;0.0001; HV%: p = 0.0002 and &lt;0.0001), and lnWMH was significantly higher in both MCI and DEM compared to NC (p = 0.05 and &lt;0.0001). No significant differences were observed in BMI. Our cohort consisted of 85.31% of Caucasian participants (180/211), with the rest comprised of 13.74% of African Americans (29/211), 0.47% of American Indian or Alaskan Native (1/211), and 0.47% of Asian (1/211).

All the variables used for analyses and their definitions are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Ranges, averages, and standard deviation for PBMC and platelet bioenergetic parameters are summarized for the entire cohort in Supplemental Table 2. Group differences in PBMC and platelet bioenergetics were assessed using General Linear Model without adjustments as well as after age, sex, and BMI adjustments. Group level mean estimates (95% CI) are summarized in Supplemental Tables 3 and 4.

3.2.2 Participant history

Supplemental Table 6 reports the medication history in the entire cohort or in cognitive groups. Data about hypertension drugs, ACE inhibitors, anti-adrenergic agents, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, vasodilators, angiotensin receptor blockers, and AD drug usage are shown.

Supplemental Table 7 reports the medical and vascular characteristics of the cohort. Data of neuropsychiatric and other neurodegenerative disorders, traumatic brain injury, cardiovascular disorder history, sleep disorder, and other diseases were evaluated.

Supplemental Table 8 reports the neuropsychological test performance results obtained from NACC UDS 3 administration in the entire cohort or in cognitive groups. Significant differences in all test results were observed between NC and MCI, and NC and DEM.

3.3 Bioenergetic profiles of different cognitive groups

High-throughput respirometry of intact cells examined the differences in overall bioenergetic capacity. The bioenergetic outcomes were basal respiration (minimum respiration rate at resting state needed to support basic body functions), maximal respiration (mimics physiological energy demand during sudden metabolic challenge by uncoupling ETC to stimulate maximum function, causing rapid substrate oxidation), reserve capacity (extra ATP produced by OXPHOS during sudden increase in energy demand), and ATP-linked respiration (ATP synthesis-linked respiration, measuring the capacity of cells to meet its energy demands). High-resolution respirometry of permeabilized cells examined respiration driven by multiple entry points to the electron transport system (ETS). Outcomes were measures of FAO and FAO-dependent respiration, including FAO capacity, FAO+CI and FAO+CI+CII (mitochondrial complex-specific respiration, corresponding to Complex I and Complex II), MaxOXPHOS, and MaxETS (maximal coupled and uncoupled respiration, respectively), providing a systematic evaluation of each component of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

3.3.1 PBMC bioenergetics

Respirometry of intact PBMCs

In intact PBMCs, maximal, reserve capacity and ATP-linked respiration were significantly lower in DEM compared to NC as well as MCI (Max: p = 0.03 and 0.05; reserve capacity: p = 0.03 and 0.04; ATP-linked: p = 0.01 and 0.01). Basal respiration was significantly lower in DEM compared to MCI (p = 0.03) (Figure 1). Basal respiration was also lower in DEM compared to NC (p = 0.06). Notably, no significant differences were observed between MCI and NC. Additionally, there were no observable differences in leak respiration (data not shown).

Respirometry of permeabilized PBMCs

Permeabilized PBMC respirometry revealed significantly lower FAO+CI, FAO+CI+CII, MaxOXPHOS, and MaxETS in DEM compared to NC (p = 0.02, 0.002, 0.03, and 0.01), and significantly lower FAO+CI+CII in DEM compared to MCI (p = 0.04) (Figure 2). Additionally, there were trends for lower FAO in DEM compared to NC (p = 0.08), lower FAO+CI+CII and MaxETS in MCI compared to NC (p = 0.1 and 0.06), and lower MaxOXPHOS and MaxETS in DEM compared to MCI (p = 0.1 and 0.1). Together, these results indicate a progressive decline in the activities of specific mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes in PBMCs, from NC to MCI to DEM.

3.3.2 Platelet bioenergetics

Respirometry of intact Platelets

In intact platelets, significantly lower maximal was observed in DEM compared to NC and MCI (Max: p = 0.01 and 0.007) (Figure 3). Lower basal and ATP-linked respiration was also observed in DEM compared to NC and MCI (basal: 0.09 and 0.1; ATP-linked: 0.1 and 0.1), with lower reserve capacity in DEM compared to MCI (p = 0.06). There were no observable differences in leak respiration (data not shown). A trend for higher respiration in MCI compared to DEM and NC were observed.

Respirometry of permeabilized Platelets

The trend for higher respiration in MCI than DEM and NC (FAO+CI+CII, MaxOXPHOS, MaxETS) was also observed in permeabilized platelets, along with significantly higher MaxOXPHOS and MaxETS in MCI compared to NC (p = 0.009 and 0.01) (Figure 4). Additionally, a trend of lower FAO+CI+CII and MaxETS were observed in DEM as compared to MCI (p = 0.08 and 0.1).

3.3.3 Analyses of cell viability

PBMC and platelet cell viability, calculated using coupling control and cell viability protocol (CCVP) that measures respiration of intact cells for respirometric determination of cell viability, averaged 80–100% in both cell types from all 3 cognitive groups. No significant intergroup differences were observed (Supplemental Figure 1). This test indicates that differences in bioenergetic capacity are based on mitochondrial function, and not differences in overall cell viability.

3.4 Relationships between bioenergetics, cognitive function, and brain morphology

Relationships between PBMC and platelet bioenergetics, cognitive function (mPACC5), and brain morphology (lnWMH volume and HV%), were assessed using data obtained from all participants and analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients. In both cell types, positive associations were observed with mPACC5 and HV%, and negative associations were observed with lnWMH. All significant relationships (p = ≤ 0.05) are represented in bold with * sign.

3.4.1 PBMC bioenergetics, cognitive function, and brain morphology

Pearson correlation coefficients were assessed between intact and permeabilized PBMC bioenergetics and mPACC5, HV%, and lnWMH (Table 2). With mPACC5, significant positive associations were observed with maximal and reserve capacity in intact PBMCs (Max: R = 0.17, p = 0.04; reserve capacity: R = 0.19, p = 0.02), and FAO-mediated respiration in permeabilized PBMCs (R = 0.15, p = 0.05). Trends for positive associations were observed in FAO+CI and FAO+CI+CII (FAO+CI: R = 0.14, p = 0.07; FAO+CI+CII: R = 0.13, p = 0.09). With HV%, significant positive associations were observed with basal, maximal, reserve capacity, and ATP-linked respiration in intact PBMCs (Basal: R = 0.20, p = 0.01; Max: R = 0.29, p &lt; 0.000; reserve capacity: R = 0.29, p &lt; 0.000; ATP-linked: R = 0.20, p = 0.01), and FAO+CI+CII, MaxOXPHOS, and MaxETS in permeabilized PBMCs (FAO+CI+CII: R = 0.16, p = 0.03; MaxOXPHOS: R = 0.19, p = 0.01; MaxETS: R = 0.20, p &lt; 0.000). With lnWMH, significant negative association was detected in FAO+CI+CII (R = −0.17, p = 0.03). Trends for negative associations were detected in FAO+CI, MaxOXPHOS and MaxETS in permeabilized PBMCs (FAO+CI: R = −0.14, p = 0.1; MaxOXPHOS: R = −0.15, p = 0.06; MaxETS: R = −0.14, p = 0.1), and in basal and ATP-linked respiration in intact PBMCs (basal: R = −0.16, p = 0.06; ATP-linked: R = −0.15, p = 0.08).

The relationships between intact PBMC bioenergetics and mPACC5, HV%, and lnWMH remained unchanged after adjustments for age, BMI and sex. In permeabilized PBMCs, no major changes were observed with BMI adjustment and revealed a significant negative relationship between basal and lnWMH in intact platelets (R = −0.17, p = 0.05). Age adjustment led to a loss of association with lnWMH and weaker associations with mPACC5. Sex adjustments decreased the strength of several relationships (Table 2).

3.4.2 Platelet bioenergetics, cognitive function, and brain morphology

Pearson correlation coefficients assessed between intact and permeabilized platelet bioenergetics, mPACC5, HV%, and lnWMH (Table 3) revealed significant positive correlation between FAO and mPACC5 (R = 0.15, p = 0.05). Significant positive associations were observed between basal and ATP-linked respiration and HV% (basal: R = 0.24, p &lt; 0.000; ATP-linked: R = 0.30, p &lt; 0.000), and significant negative correlations were observed between basal and ATP-linked respiration and lnWMH (basal: R = −0.17, p = 0.04; ATP-linked: R = −0.16, p = 0.05). Basal, ATP-linked respiration, and FAO+CI showed trends for positive correlations with mPACC5 (basal: R = 0.15, p = 0.06; ATP-linked: R = 0.15, p = 0.06; FAO+CI: R = 0.12, p = 0.1), while maximal showed trends for negative association with lnWMH (R = −0.15, p = 0.1). Age adjustment revealed a significant negative relationship between Max and lnWMH in intact platelets (R = −0.18, p = 0.05), and BMI and sex adjustments in permeabilized platelets diminished relationships with mPACC5. No other associations were significantly affected by age, BMI, and sex adjustments.

3.4.3 Mitochondrial bioenergetics and ApoE status

Supplemental Table 5 shows bioenergetic differences among ApoE4+/− groups in both cell types. ApoE4+ group consists of ApoE 2/4, ApoE 3/4, ApoE 4/4, and ApoE4- group consists of ApoE 2/2, ApoE 2/3, ApoE 3/3. ChiSquare test revealed uneven distribution in ApoE4 status, with significant difference among the cognitive groups (p = 0.039). However, no difference in PBMC and platelet bioenergetics were observed between ApoE4+/− groups in the entire cohort or in cognitive groups, indicating no significant impact of ApoE status on bioenergetics. This suggests that mitochondrial bioenergetics may be an independent risk factor of AD, unrelated to ApoE status.

3.4.4 Relationships between bioenergetic parameters

We examined whether the relationship between bioenergetic parameterss are different between participants from individual cognitive groups by testing the relationship between ATP-linked and basal respiration. Supplementary Figure 2 shows PBMC and platelet bioenergetic associations in different cognitive groups, while Supplementary Table 9 presents the associations between ATP-linked and basal respiration in intact PBMC and platelets. These associations were extremely significant and were not found to be different between cognitive groups (R &gt; 0.9 and p &lt; 0.000 for all 3 cognitive groups). Similar associations between maximal and basal respiration, as well as reserve capacity and basal respiration were also not found to be different between cognitive groups (data not shown).
