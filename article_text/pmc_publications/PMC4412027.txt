Background

Subjective memory complaints (SMCs) represent an individual’s perception of subtle changes in memory in the absence of objective impairment in memory. However, it is not fully known whether persons with SMCs harbor brain alterations related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or whether they indeed demonstrate poorer cognitive performance.

Methods

Participants were 261 middle-aged adults (mean age=54.30 years) enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention, a registry of cognitively normal adults at risk for AD. They answered a question pertaining to subjective memory, completed a comprehensive neuropsychological exam, and subsequently underwent a volumetric MRI scan. Cortical thickness measurements were derived from 10 a priori regions of interest involved in AD. Analyses of covariance were conducted to investigate group differences in cortical thickness and neuropsychological measures.

Results

Compared with individuals without SMCs, individuals with SMCs had significant cortical thinning in the entorhinal, fusiform, posterior cingulate, and inferior parietal cortices, as well as significantly reduced amygdala volume. Similarly, those with SMCs had significantly lower test scores on measures of Immediate Memory, Verbal Learning &amp; Memory, and Verbal Ability. Additional adjustment for depressive symptoms (which differed between the groups) attenuated only the findings for the entorhinal cortex (p=.061) and Verbal Ability (p=.076).

Conclusions

At-risk, cognitively healthy individuals with SMCs exhibit cortical thinning in brain regions affected by AD as well as poorer performance on objective memory tests. These findings suggest that, in some individuals, SMCs might represent the earliest stages of AD.

1. Introduction

Recent years has witnessed a growing interest in subjective memory complaints (SMCs) as a potential precursor to symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although there is currently no universally accepted definition [1], SMCs are generally believed to represent subtle changes in memory that fall below detection thresholds of common cognitive tests [1]. Furthermore, the question of whether individuals with SMCs are a population with increased risk of progression to AD remains controversial. Some investigators have suggested that SMCs are characteristic of a “worried well” population; hence the lack of associations between SMCs and memory performance in such studies [2, 3]. On the other hand, others have found significant relationships between SMCs and objective cognitive performance [4-6]. For example, a recent study [5], found significant correlations between SMCs and decreased performance on objective measures of episodic memory, working memory, and semantic knowledge. In addition, longitudinal studies have shown SMC groups to have a faster rate of decline on immediate recall and related psychometric measures [4, 7].

If SMCs indeed represent an individual’s awareness of early, subtle, changes in cognition, a relationship should be expected between SMCs and specific AD pathological processes such as atrophy of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and lateral/middle parietal cortices [8-11]. So far, a number of studies have reported evidence for such brain changes. For example, Jessen et al., [12] found decreased entorhinal cortex volume in individuals with SMCs when compared with healthy controls. Additionally, a more recent study [13] found gray matter volume reductions in several brain areas such as the hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and precuneus in elderly subjects with SMCs. Other studies probing additional known AD biomarkers have found that SMCs are associated with higher amyloid-β deposition [5, 14, 15]. Taken together, these findings suggest that memory complaints may reflect actual AD-related brain alterations.

Whereas brain volume might shrink as a result of either normal aging or a neurodegenerative process such as AD, cortical thinning is believed to be a hallmark feature of AD [16, 17], though there have been some reports of thinning in the prefrontal cortex as part of non-pathological aging [18, 19]. While previous studies have examined the relationship between regional brain volume and SMCs, no studies to date have investigated whether SMCs are linked to thinning in AD-sensitive brain regions. Furthermore, the majority of the studies in this area have focused on cohorts of elderly adults. Thus, it remains unknown whether SMCs in midlife is related to brain and cognitive changes, particularly in an at-risk cohort that might ostensibly be overly sensitive to normal fluctuations in mental function.

Accordingly, in the current study, we examined whether SMCs are associated with thinning of cortical regions involved in AD within a middle-aged cohort of cognitively-normal individuals with risk factors for AD. Additionally, we also examined how individuals with SMCs perform on objective cognitive tests compared with individuals without SMCs.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1. Participants

Data from 261 middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) cohort were used in this study. WRAP is a longitudinal registry composed of more than 1500 cognitively-normal middle-aged adults between the ages of 40 and 65 at study entry [20]. Participants for this study were selected on the basis of having completed a baseline WRAP visit and a subsequent MRI scan. The sample was enriched for parental family history of AD (FH, 71.3%) and possession of the epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4, 42.1%). The methods for determining FH have been described previously [21]. Briefly, to verify the diagnosis of AD in the parent, parental medical records were obtained (including autopsy reports when available) and reviewed by a multidisciplinary diagnostic consensus panel. When records are not available, the Dementia Questionnaire (DQ)[22] was used. Absence of FH of AD was verified through detailed medical history surveys and phone interview (including the DQ) with the participants. Inclusion in the FH− group required that the father survive to at least age 70 and the mother to age 75 without incurring a formal diagnosis of dementia or exhibiting cognitive deterioration. Women comprised 67.4% of the sample and the average age at baseline was 54.30±6.44 years (see Table 1 for a summary of participants’ background characteristics). Study exclusion criteria included major neurological disorder (e.g., head trauma with loss of consciousness, neoplasms, and seizure disorders), current (i.e., within the last 12 months) major psychiatric disease (e.g., major depression, bipolar I, schizophrenia) at time of both WRAP visit and MRI scan, MRI contraindications, and abnormal MRI findings (e.g., ventriculomegaly). The University of Wisconsin Institutional Review board approved all study procedures and each subject provided signed informed consent before participation.

2.2. Subjective memory measure

As part of their baseline WRAP visit, participants completed a General Health questionnaire that included an item that inquired about subjective memory complaints. Specifically, participants were asked, “Do you think you have a problem with your memory?” Participants who responded, “Yes,” (N=77) were considered to have SMCs (i.e., SMC+) whereas those who responded, “No” (N=184) were considered to not have SMCs (i.e., SMC-).

2.3. Neuroimaging protocol

The MRI images were acquired on a GE x750 3.0T scanner with an eight channel phased array head coil (General Electric, Waukesha, WI). The protocol featured a 3D T1-weighted inversion recovery-prepared SPGR volume collected using the following parameters: TI/TE/TR=450ms/3.2ms/8.2ms, flip angle=12°, slice thickness=1mm no gap, FOV=256, mat rix size=256×256. The mean time interval between the WRAP visit and the MRI scan was 5.48±1.82 years.

Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was done with FreeSurfer software package version 5.1.0 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The technical details of these procedures are described in prior publications [23-26]. Briefly, the T1 SPGR acquisitions were skull stripped and transformed into Talairach space. Next, surface meshes were created, which are defined by the gray/white matter boundary (the white matter surface) and the gray/CSF boundary (the pial surface) [27]. Parcellation and segmentation were completed based on a predefined atlas [28]. Subcortical volume measures were acquired from the segmentations whereas, cortical thickness measurements were obtained by calculating the distance along a normal vector from each vertex in the white matter surface to the pial surface. The thickness values at each vertex within a region of interest (ROI) were averaged to obtain the ROI’s thickness. A summary measure for each ROI was then derived by averaging values from the right and left hemispheres. Each FreeSurfer output was visually inspected to ensure that the cortical reconstruction was accurate and without topological defects. Our analyses focused on select ROIs known to be affected early in the AD cascade, such as the hippocampus and posterior cingulate (see Table 2 for full listing).

2.4. Cognitive assessment

At their baseline WRAP visit, the participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery comprised of psychometric measures that span traditional cognitive domains of memory, attention, executive function, language, and visuospatial ability. Earlier factor analytic studies [29, 30] of these psychometric measures within the larger WRAP cohort showed that these tests map onto 6 cognitive factors [~N(0,1)]: Immediate Memory, Verbal Learning &amp; Memory, Working Memory, Speed &amp; Flexibility, Visuospatial Ability, and Verbal Ability (see Table 3 for full listing of each factor’s constituent tests). These factor scores were used in our present evaluation of the association between SMCs and cognition. In addition to these cognitive tests, participants also completed the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression questionnaire (CES-D).

2.5. Statistical analyses

Group differences on baseline demographic measures were tested using independent samples t-test or chi-square analyses as appropriate. We used analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for group differences (SMC+ vs. SMC−) on our a priori ROIs. For the thickness measures, we adjusted for age, sex, and the time interval between cognitive assessment and brain imaging. For volumetric measures, covariates included age, sex, total intracranial volume, and the time interval between cognitive assessment and brain imaging. Similarly, we used an ANCOVA framework to assess group differences on the neuropsychological measures. Covariates included age, sex, and education. All relevant model assumptions (eg., normality and homogeneity of variance) were evaluated and found to be satisfactorily met. Analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Only findings with a 2-tailed p value ≤ .05 were considered significant.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Background characteristics

The SMC+ and SMC− groups did not differ significantly on age, sex, FH, APOE4 status, education, or global cognition. There were significantly more people with CES-D scores ≥16 (the established cutpoint for elevated depressive symptoms [31]) in the SMC+ group (n=11) compared with the SMC− group (n=5). These results are summarized in Table 1.

3.2. Association between SMCs and brain structure

The ANCOVA that examined group differences in brain structure revealed that, compared with the SMC− group, the SMC+ group had significantly thinner cortex in the entorhinal, fusiform, posterior cingulate, and inferior parietal cortices. In addition, amygdala volume was significantly lower in SMC+ compared with SMC−. Although the groups did not differ significantly on other brain regions, a consistent trend was observed such that the SMC+ group demonstrated lower values than the SMC− group. These results are shown in Table 2. When we additionally adjusted for FH and APOE4 status, the results remained unchanged with the exception that the posterior cingulate finding became marginally significant (p= .085).

3.3. Association between SMCs and objective cognitive function

Table 3 shows the results of comparisons between SMC+ and SMC− groups on objective cognitive measures. SMC+ individuals had poorer test scores than those in the SMC− group on Immediate Memory, Verbal Learning &amp; Memory, and Verbal Ability. A trend toward poorer Working Memory (p = .068) and Visuospatial Ability (p = .096) in the SMC+ group was also observed. Even so, we note that—consistent with this being a cognitively-normal cohort—mean test scores within the SMC+ group was not lower than 0.2 standard deviations below the mean on any cognitive domain (the typical cut point for abnormal cognitive test scores being ≥1.5 standard deviations below reference mean). As with the brain structure analysis, we additionally adjusted for FH and APOE4 status in the models. The only change to the initial results was Verbal Ability, which was now reduced to a trend (p=.065).

3.4 Secondary analyses

Because study entry criteria excluded persons with a history of depressive disorders, the observed group difference on the CES-D was not deemed clinically meaningful. However, we opted to perform follow-up sensitivity analyses to determine whether and to what extent our initial findings were driven by elevated depressive symptoms, given emerging evidence that SMCs might be linked to depression [12, 32].

We began by running Pearson’s correlations to examine associations between our brain/cognitive measures and CES-D scores (dichotomized at ≥ 16). This was founded on the statistical premise that, if CES-D scores are not associated with the outcomes, then elevated depressive symptoms could not be the primary underlying reason for the observed associations between SMCs and the outcomes [33]. Then, where any of the brain/cognitive measures was found to be significantly correlated with the CES-D, we re-ran the original ANCOVA analyses while including CES-D as an additional covariate.

The Pearson’s correlations showed that only Verbal Ability (r=-.14, p=.024) and entorhinal cortex thickness (r=-.13, p=.037) were significantly associated with CES-D scores. When the ANCOVAs were refit while additionally adjusting for CES-D, the SMC+ group continued to exhibit lower scores on both Verbal Ability and entorhinal cortex thickness compared with the SMC− group. However, these between-group differences now became marginally significant (p’s of .076 and .061, respectively). Of interest though, CES-D was not significantly associated with either measure [p’s of .290 (ΔR2=.003) and .269 (ΔR2=.005), respectively] in these refitted ANCOVAs. Because the essence of our original SMCs findings persisted upon correction for elevated depressive symptoms, it appears those initial findings were not primarily driven by differentials in depressive symptoms between the groups.

Lastly, we repeated these sensitivity analyses using CES-D scores obtained from the WRAP visit closest to the time of the MRI scan (6.84±6.12 months), in order to determine whether and to what extent our findings were driven by “MRI-concurrent” depressive symptoms. Pearson’s correlations showed no significant associations (p’s &gt; .112) between these mri-concurrent CES-D scores and our outcome measures, suggesting that depressive symptoms at time of MRI are unlikely to be the underlying reason for the observed associations between SMCs and the outcomes [33].

4. DISCUSSION

In this study, we found that middle-aged individuals with SMCs harbor thinner cortex in AD-vulnerable brain regions such as the entorhinal, fusiform, inferior parietal, and posterior cingulate cortices, and had reduced amygdala volume compared with their peers without SMCs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify decreased cortical thickness in individuals with SMCs. In addition, we observed that objective cognitive test scores were decreased in individuals with SMCs compared with those without. Specifically, measures of Immediate Memory, Verbal Learning &amp; Memory, and Verbal Ability were all found to be significantly lower in individuals with SMCs.

A growing number of studies have investigated structural brain changes in SMCs [32, 34-36]. In one such study, conducted in a large community-based sample, SMCs were associated with cross-sectional decrements in hippocampal, parahippocampal, and amygdalar volumes [35], as well as longitudinal hippocampal volume loss 4 years later [36]. Similarly, a study of individuals referred to a memory clinic found that persons with SMCs had significantly smaller right hippocampal volume compared with controls [32]. Additionally, another study [34] found individuals with SMCs to have smaller hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes compared with individuals without SMCs. Our findings of significant cortical thinning of AD-relevant cortices complement these volumetric studies. Of note, a prior study [12], had also found that SMC+ individuals exhibit lower entorhinal cortex volume but not lower hippocampal volume when compared with SMC− individuals. This is in accord with the known topographic progression of neurodegenerative changes in AD, which starts in the transentorhinal region, and then moves to the entorhinal cortex before affecting the hippocampus [37-39]. This topographic sequence might explain why the extent of entorhinal atrophy has been shown to better identify cognitively-normal individuals at risk for developing AD compared with hippocampal atrophy [40-42].

Although we did not directly examine other imaging biomarkers of AD in this study, current hypothetical models of AD pathophysiological changes suggest that brain structure changes occur later in the AD cascade compared with alterations in amyloid-β and glucose metabolism [43]. Therefore, our observed group differences in brain structure would suggest that cerebral amyloidosis and/or hypometabolism in AD-related brain regions might be detectable in individuals with SMCs. Indeed, a growing number of studies are reporting evidence for such disease-related changes [5, 7, 15, 32]. For example, Perrotin and colleagues [15] found individuals with SMCs to have increased fibrillary amyloid deposition in the right posterior cingulate and precuneus, and another study [32] observed hypometabolism in the right parahippocampal gyrus, right hippocampus, and bilateral precuneus in older adults with SMCs. These findings, in combination with our study which provides new neuroimaging evidence of cortical thinning in AD-vulnerable brain regions, adds to the notion that individuals with SMCs might represent a population at increased risk for eventual progression to probable AD [43-47].

Investigations of the link between SMCs and objective cognitive performance represent an active area of research, and the emerging evidence is heterogeneous [4, 5, 12, 32, 48]. Congruent with our study, Amariglio and colleagues [5] found SMCs to be associated with decreased episodic and working memory. Similarly, Scheef et al., [32] found a decline in episodic and immediate verbal memory in a population with SMCs. Another longitudinal study has also provided evidence for decline on measures of working memory and perceptual motor skills in individuals with SMCs [4]. Our observation of comparatively decreased performance in Immediate Memory, Verbal Learning &amp; Memory, and Verbal Ability in individuals with SMCs is in accord with the findings from these prior studies. Like MTL structural alterations, impairment in episodic memory is an early feature of AD [49]. Therefore, our finding of concomitant decreases in episodic memory and mesial temporal cortical thickness in our SMC+ participants raises the possibility that these individuals might be in the very early stages of the AD cascade. As the WRAP is an ongoing study, we will be well positioned to investigate the long-term prognostic utility of early subjective complaints.

We observed no significant group differences in APOE4 status, FH, age, education, or sex indicating that those with these risk factors for AD are not any more likely to report SMCs in midlife than those without these risk factors. This is in agreement with most studies on SMCs [12, 15, 32, 48]. Even so, the absence of a family history differential between our SMC groups was rather surprising. Individuals with a FH typically are aware they harbor this risk factor, which is not always the case for other risk factors such as APOE4 status. This awareness, and the experience of observing the disease course in their affected relative(s), often leads to a heightened sensitivity to what might otherwise be normal variability in cognitive functioning [50, 51]. Therefore, if SMCs were merely a symptom of a “worried well” population, one would have expected that persons with a FH would disproportionately endorse subjective memory failures [52]. The absence of such an association in this sample suggests that, at least in some contexts, a simple inquiry into SMCs might have clinical validity for identifying the subset of cognitively-normal persons who might be truly experiencing objective cognitive difficulties, and associated brain changes, and thus have a greater risk of future progression to AD.

Our observation of greater depressive symptoms in the SMC+ group parallels reports from other investigators [7, 12, 32, 34, 53]. A recent study by Steinberg et al., [53] found that scores on a questionnaire pertaining to SMCs were associated with measures of depressive symptoms. Additionally, other investigators [12, 32] have found individuals with SMCs to have significantly higher scores on measures of depression compared with controls. Interestingly, in both these latter studies, differences between the SMC− and SMC+ groups on gray matter volume, cerebral glucose metabolism, and cognitive performance persisted even after adjustment was made for depressive symptoms. Similarly, although we found CES-D scores to be bivariately correlated with two of our outcome measures (Verbal Ability and entorhinal cortex thickness), when we introduced CES-D into the original multivariable statistical model, it failed to be associated with either of these measures and the essence of our original SMCs findings persisted. When this negative CES-D finding is placed in the context of our study’s entry criteria, which excluded persons with major depression and other major psychiatric disorders, it appears rather improbable that memory complaints were driven by clinical depression in our study. Even so, there is some evidence that mid-to-late-life depressive symptoms are associated with cortical thinning in parietal and temporal regions [54], and might even be a prodrome for dementing disorders [55]. It would be of future interest to determine whether greater depressive symptoms at baseline are associated with prospective changes in brain health and cognition within our cohort [56].

Our study has some limitations. While the cross-sectional nature of this study gives insight to the initial brain and cognitive changes that may be differentially occurring in middle-aged individuals with SMCs, longitudinal studies would be needed for a full understanding of these initial findings. Given that WRAP is ongoing, we will have the data to determine whether asymptomatic individuals with SMCs are more likely to transition into symptomatic stages of the AD cascade. Also, the WRAP cohort is predominantly composed of highly educated, non-Hispanic White individuals. Therefore, it is not known if our measure of SMCs would be similarly associated with brain structure and objective cognition in a more heterogeneous middle-aged sample. Additionally, a single question about subjective complaints, such as that used in the current study, might be vulnerable to temporal instability and might fail to adequately capture the underlying complexity that these complaints represent. There is extensive precedent in the literature, however, for such single-item measures of subjective complaints, as documented in the recent white paper from the Subjective Cognitive Decline Initiative working group [1]. A major goal of this working group is to institute common standards for the burgeoning SMCs field. These common standards, once established, will help guide future work, including our own, on SMCs.

In summary, our study indicates that at-risk, cognitively-normal, middle-aged individuals with SMCs exhibit cortical thinning in brain regions affected by AD as well as poorer objective scores—albeit within normal limits—on memory tests. These results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that individuals with SMCs might be at increased risk of progression to AD. A simple question about subjective memory, such as the one asked in this study, is easily incorporated into busy clinical practices, with potential to be useful for early identification of at-risk older adults, especially when taken in conjunction with other pertinent health and clinical information. Such individuals might then be potential candidates for clinical trials investigating disease-modifying interventions for AD.
