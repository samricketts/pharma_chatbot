Oligomers of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) are thought to be the proximal toxic agents initiating the neuropathologic process in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Therefore, targeting the self-assembly and oligomerization of Aβ has been an important strategy for designing AD therapeutics. In parallel, research into the metallobiology of AD has shown that Zn2+ can strongly modulate the aggregation of Aβ in vitro and both promote and inhibit the neurotoxicity of Aβ, depending on the experimental conditions. Thus, successful inhibitors of Aβ self-assembly may have to inhibit the toxicity not only of Aβ oligomers themselves but also of Aβ-Zn2+ complexes. However, there has been relatively little research investigating the effects of Aβ self-assembly and toxicity inhibitors in the presence of Zn2+. Our group has characterized previously a series of Aβ42 C-terminal fragments (CTFs), some of which have been shown to inhibit Aβ oligomerization and neurotoxicity. Here, we asked whether three CTFs shown to be potent inhibitors of Aβ42 toxicity maintained their activity in the presence of Zn2+. Biophysical analysis showed that the CTFs had different effects on oligomer, β-sheet, and fibril formation by Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes. However, cell viability experiments in differentiated PC-12 cells incubated with Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in the absence or presence of these CTFs showed that the CTFs completely lost their inhibitory activity in the presence of Zn2+ even when applied at 10-fold excess relative to Aβ42. In light of these results, we tested another inhibitor, the molecular tweezer CLR01, which coincidentally had been shown to have a high affinity for Zn2+, suggesting that it could disrupt both Aβ42 oligomerization and Aβ42-Zn2+ complexation. Indeed, we found that CLR01 effectively inhibited the toxicity of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes. Moreover, it did so at a lower concentration than needed for inhibiting the toxicity of Aβ42 alone. In agreement with these results, CLR01 inhibited β-sheet and fibril formation in Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes. Our data suggest that, for the development of efficient therapeutic agents, inhibitors of Aβ self-assembly and toxicity should be examined in the presence of relevant metal ions and that molecular tweezers may be particularly attractive candidates for therapy development.

INTRODUCTION

Amyloid β-protein (Aβ) self-assembly into neurotoxic oligomers and aggregates is a seminal pathological process in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1,2 Although deposition of fibrillar Aβ aggregates in amyloid plaques originally led to the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis,3,4 nonfibrillar Aβ oligomers are now considered by most researchers to be the true culprit causing the initial disruption of synaptic communication and instigating the cascade of events that leads to AD.5–11 The other offending protein self-assembly process in AD, that of hyperphosphorylated tau, is believed to be secondary to the initial Aβ insults.12 Therefore, targeting Aβ oligomers, particularly those of the longer and more toxic form, Aβ42, is a popular strategy for therapy development.13

In parallel, research into the metallobiology of AD has identified several metal ions that interact with Aβ, modulate its self-assembly and toxicity, and may be important for the onset and progression of the disease.14,15 Metal cations, such as Zn2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+, have been reported to stimulate the deposition of Aβ and promote the hyperphosphorylation of tau.16,17 Much of the research has focused on the effects of Cu2+ and Zn2+ due to their role in the maintenance of neuronal excitability, their function as cofactors, and their contribution to oxidative stress and inflammation in the AD brain.18 In addition, both ions have been shown to modulate the oligomerization and aggregation of Aβ itself.19–22

Zn2+ has been of particular interest due to its presence in deposited amyloid plaques and its concentration in glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus.23,24 Interestingly, Zn2+ ions have been reported to both accelerate and inhibit Aβ aggregation and both increase Aβ neurotoxicity and protect against Aβ neurotoxicity, depending on the specific conditions used by each group, including the concentration of Aβ and Zn2+, the ratio between these concentrations, and the solution conditions.24–29 Indeed, our own work showed that Zn2+ accelerated formation of nonfibrillar, yet β-sheet rich, aggregates of Aβ40 and that the toxicity of Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes depended on the method of their addition to cultured neurons.30

In the AD brain, high concentrations (~1 mM) of Zn2+ have been found in amyloid plaques along with elevated levels in the hippocampus and serum of patients.31 Zn2+ concentrations up to 300 μM have been measured in synaptic vesicles32,33 and during synaptic transmission, and direct imaging of Zn2+ using fluorescent probes has shown a release of 10–30 μM of Zn2+ into the synaptic cleft.34 It is predominantly under these circumstances that free Zn2+ is thought to associate with Aβ32,35–37 and induce the formation of neurotoxic assemblies.32,38 Previously, we found that Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes were β-sheet-rich, nonfibrillar, quasi-spherical aggregates that suppressed spontaneous Ca2+ transients and were toxic to primary hippocampal neurons when added at small concentrations in several portions, but not when added at a higher concentration in the beginning of the experiment.30 These findings led us to ask how the presence of Zn2+ might impact the interaction of Aβ assembly inhibitors/modulators with Aβ and whether such inhibitors maintained their inhibitory activity in the presence of Zn2+.

Therapy development efforts targeting Aβ-metal-ion interactions have focused on chelators, such as clioquinol, a hydroxyquinoline-derived drug, which was shown to prevent cognitive decline in Zn2+-transporter knockout mice,39,40 and its successor, PBT2, which was found to lower Aβ levels in the CSF of patients with AD.41 More recently, several compounds have been reported to have both metal-ion chelating activity and act as Aβ assembly inhibitors regardless of metal binding.42–49 However, the latter activity may arise from the weak nature of the forces mediating Aβ oligomerization, which is easily modulated by many small molecules nonspecifically,13 potentially through the formation of colloids.50

Previously, we reported that certain C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of Aβ42 interacted with the full-length peptide, modulated its oligomerization, and inhibited its toxicity.51–54 In particular, out of 15 peptides with the general formula Aβ(x−42), where x = 28–39, Aβ(31–42) and Aβ(39–42) had notably high inhibitory activity. In addition, an Aβ40 CTF that originally was tested as a control, Aβ(30–40), was found to be a potent inhibitor of Aβ42-induced toxicity.55 Thus, we decided to use these CTFs as a test case and determine how their inhibitory activity might be affected by the presence of Zn2+. We studied the effect of the CTFs on the conformational change kinetics and morphology of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes and on their toxicity in cell culture. We show that the CTFs’ effects on Aβ42 β-sheet formation, morphology, and cytotoxicity are dramatically altered by the interactions of Aβ42 with Zn2+. In light of these results, we also tested another inhibitor of Aβ self-assembly and toxicity, the molecular tweezer CLR01, and found that its activity also was affected by the presence of Zn2+, but in a distinct way.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Zn2+ Alters Aβ42 Assembly and Toxicity.

Because the CTFs were originally conceived as potential inhibitors of Aβ42, here we characterized first the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ42 in the presence of Zn2+. In our previous study of Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes, the biophysical characterization of the system was done primarily in a 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer.30 An interesting finding was that the addition of Zn2+ reduced the increase in thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence even though circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy showed that Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes were rich in β-sheet. Therefore, we used both techniques here again to assess the temporal conformational changes in Aβ42 in the presence of Zn2+. However, initial attempts to characterize the temporal changes of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in MOPS buffer using CD spectroscopy yielded low signal-to-noise ratio spectra, because MOPS strongly absorbs light below 200 nm.56 For this reason, we decided to change the buffer from MOPS to phosphate buffer (PB). Using PB, we found that reproducibility was low and data interpretation was difficult when using a concentration of Aβ42 below 20 μM. Therefore, although lower concentrations were used in our toxicity assays, the investigation of Aβ42 aggregation and conformational change in the presence of Zn2+ and the effect of the CTFs on this process was done using 20 μM Aβ42. To be able to compare these experiments with the toxicity assays, the Aβ42/Zn2+ concentration ratio was kept at 1:2, respectively, in all experiments.

In the absence of Zn2+, Aβ42 showed a two-phased sigmoidal curve, consisting of a short lag phase of ~3 h, a relatively slow increase up to ~14 h, and a faster increase reaching a plateau at ~42 h (Figure 1A). This rate of ThT fluorescence increase was slow relative to other reports in the literature, including from our own group, even when using lower concentrations of Aβ42.24,27,57,58 In our experience, many factors influence the rate of the increase, including the peptide source and the exact preparation method, including the steps used for disaggregation and solubilization, peptide concentration, buffer type and concentration, salt type and concentration, pH, temperature, agitation method, and agitation rate. As explained above, we chose the conditions for these experiments to allow meaningful comparisons with the conditions in which Zn2+ and/or CTFs were added to the reaction mixture, taking into account that precise quantitative comparison with the multiple previous reports in the literature may not be possible due to the different conditions used in each study.

In contrast to Aβ42 alone, in the presence of 2 equiv of Zn2+, no lag phase was observed. Rather, the ThT fluorescence increased rapidly during the first 8 h and reached a maximum at ~16 h. However, the maximum fluorescence was substantially lower than the value for Aβ42 alone (Figure 1A), in agreement with the behavior of Aβ40 in the presence of Zn2+ reported previously.30

CD spectroscopy analysis of the Aβ42 conformation in the absence of Zn2+ showed a gradual transition from a predominantly statistical coil spectrum at t = 0, characterized by a minimum at 198–200 nm, to a primarily β-sheet spectrum at 196 h, displaying the typical maximum at 195–196 nm and minimum at 215–218 nm (Figure 1B). In the presence of Zn2+, an overall transition from statistical coil to β-sheet also was observed (Figure 1C), but with two important differences. First, unlike the gradual conformation change observed in the spectra of Aβ42 alone already at early time points, in the presence of Zn2+ the spectra remained largely unchanged for the first 24 h, suggesting a delay in the conformational transition. Second, the amplitude of the spectra in the presence of Zn2+ was substantially reduced compared to the spectra of Aβ42 alone, suggesting overall smaller changes in the presence of Zn2+. These data suggested that, upon addition of Zn2+ to Aβ42, Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes formed rapidly, and although they changed over time, the change involved relatively minor conformational rearrangements.

Interestingly, the rapid increase in ThT fluorescence (Figure 1A) disagreed with the small change in conformation observed by CD during this time (Figure 1B), suggesting that, in the presence of Zn2+, ThT might bind rapidly to Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes without formation of substantial β-sheet conformation. The binding may involve a ternary complex formed by the protein, the metal ion, and the dye molecules, yet it is an atypical phenomenon that does not actually report on the formation of a cross-β structure or of amyloid fibrils, as would be expected in a typical ThT-fluorescence experiment. In agreement with this interpretation, the overall magnitude of the change in fluorescence during the reaction was only ~30% compared to Aβ42 alone. An alternative explanation might stem from formation of insoluble aggregates that bind ThT but have little impact on the CD spectrum. We did not observe particulate matter in the solutions in either experiment, but we cannot rule out the formation of insoluble, ThT-positive aggregates that were too small to detect by the naked eye.

Morphological examination of each preparation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at intermediate time points (Supporting Information Figure S1) and at the end of the aggregation reaction (Figure 1D,E) showed that, during the reaction, oligomers and fibrils were observed, whereas at the end of the aggregation reaction, abundant fibrils were present in both cases. However, the abundance was higher in samples containing Aβ42 alone, in which some fibrils appeared thicker and comprised multiple thin filaments. Quasi-globular structures, presumably oligomers, also were observed but were relatively sparse in samples of Aβ42 alone. In the samples containing Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes, the fibrils were thinner on average than in those containing Aβ42 alone, and twisted fibrils appeared to comprise mainly two intertwined threads. The abundance of quasi-globular structures and amorphous aggregates in these samples was substantially higher than in samples of Aβ42 alone (Supporting Information Figure S1 and Figure 1D,E).

To measure the toxicity of Aβ42 in the absence or presence of Zn2+, we employed a strategy developed in our previous study of Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes.30 In that study, we found that, if 10 μM Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes were added to primary rat hippocampal neurons all at once, they did not cause measurable toxicity 48 h later, likely because under these conditions the formation of toxic structures was transient and too short before the complexes transformed into larger, nontoxic aggregates.30 In contrast, if the sample was divided into four equal portions, each of which was prepared freshly and added 12 h apart, more than 80% of the cells were found to be dead at 48 h using a neuron-specific enolase assay. Here, we used differentiated PC-12 cells and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay to measure cell viability. First, we confirmed that upon addition of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in one portion to the cells, little toxicity was observed after a 48 h incubation (3.8 00B1 2.0% cell death, Figure 2) compared to Aβ42 alone (42.3 ± 2.7% cell death). Zn2+ on its own was not toxic under these conditions (1.9 ± 3.1% cell death). Therefore, we adopted the previously established protocol,30 added a fresh aliquot equal to a quarter of each sample at t = 0, 12, 24, and 36 h, and measured cell viability at 48 h. Under these conditions Aβ42 showed increased toxicity (60.1 ± 2.0% cell death), Zn2+ was not toxic (1.9 ± 0.3% cell death), and Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes gave somewhat variable results, but overall were ~6 times more toxic than when added in one portion (24.7 ± 14.9% cell death, Figure 2). Therefore, we used the four-portion paradigm in all the toxicity-inhibition experiments.

CTFs Have Distinct Effects on the Self-Assembly of Aβ42-Zn2+ Complexes.

To test the effect of Aβ(39–42), Aβ(31–42), and Aβ(30–40) on the aggregation of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes, we incubated mixtures of 20 μM Aβ42, 40 μM Zn2+, and 100 μM of each CTF at 37 °C with agitation and measured the change in ThT fluorescence and CD spectra during the aggregation reactions. In control ThT experiments, the CTFs were examined on their own or in the presence of Zn2+ at the same concentrations. Compared to Aβ42-Zn2+ alone (Figure 3A), the ThT signal of Aβ42-Zn2+ in the presence of Aβ(39–42) increased initially at a similar rate, whereas the final fluorescence was ~25% lower (Figure 3A, blue curve). In contrast, a markedly different behavior was observed in the presence of Aβ(31–42) or Aβ(30–40). In both cases, the initial fluorescence was ~5 times higher than in the presence of Aβ42-Zn2+ alone or Aβ42-Zn2+ in the presence of Aβ(39–42), suggesting a rapid formation of quaternary complexes comprising Aβ42, Zn2+, the CTF, and ThT. This interpretation was supported by the observation that Zn2+ had a minimal impact on the behavior of the CTFs on their own (Figure 3B). Aβ(39–42) and Aβ(31–42) showed essentially no change in fluorescence during the experiment, regardless of the presence of Zn2+. In contrast, the fluorescence of Aβ(30–40) showed a two-step increase followed by a slow decrease after 24 h. In the presence of Zn2+ the initial increase in ThT fluorescence was accelerated and was followed by a decrease up to ~10 h and then a plateau (Figure 3B).

In the mixtures with Aβ42, Aβ(31–42) caused a rapid increase in the ThT fluorescence signal, which peaked at ~18 h and then declined steadily until the end of the experiment (Figure 3A). In the presence of Aβ(30–40) (Figure 3A), the fluorescence increased slightly in the first 90 min, then declined rapidly for the next ~16 h, followed by a slower decline until the end of the experiment, at which point, the fluorescence was only a little higher than that of Aβ42-Zn2+ alone. Comparison of Figures 3A and B suggested that this behavior might have been influenced by the CTF itself and might not have reflected formation of a complex involving Aβ42 and Aβ(30–40), though formation of a complex could not be ruled out (the experiments in Figures 3A and B were done using different plate readers, and therefore the comparison is qualitative rather than quantitative). Interestingly, in the presence of Aβ42, in both the cases of Aβ(31–42) and Aβ(30–40), the behavior of the different replicates was highly consistent for the first 8 h of the experiment but then diverged substantially (Figure 3A). Nonetheless, despite the relatively low reproducibility among replicates between 8 and 72 h, the distinction among the behavior of the different mixtures was clear. These peculiar behaviors supported the idea that in these experiments ThT fluorescence either reflected formation of complexes that were different from the typical binding of the dye molecules to cross-β structures of amyloid fibrils or, in the case of Aβ(30–40), the ThT-fluorescence curve was dominated by the behavior of the CTF itself.

To further assess the change in secondary structure of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in the presence of CTFs, we examined the temporal changes in CD spectra of the same mixtures (prepared together but incubated without ThT) and deconvoluted the spectra to gain additional insight. CD spectra of the CTFs themselves have been reported previously53 and therefore were not recorded here. Supporting the interpretation that the ThT data reflected atypical complexes rather than cross-β structures, unlike their distinct behavior in the ThT-fluorescence experiments, all three CTFs showed roughly similar attenuation of the conformational change in CD spectroscopy (Figure 4B,D,F). In all cases, the initial spectra were characteristic of a statistical coil. Over 11 d of incubation, relatively small changes were observed in the presence of the CTFs. The magnitude of the minimum at 195–198 nm decreased, and the molar ellipticity at the typical ~215 nm minimum characteristic of a β-sheet slightly increased, yet those changes were relatively minor, and the final spectra suggested that the peptides (Aβ42 and CTF) were still largely unstructured in these complexes. Again, dissimilarity between the ThT and CD data might reflect the formation of ThT-positive insoluble aggregates that did not contribute to the CD spectra and were too small to detect by the naked eye.

To quantify the change, we deconvoluted the spectra using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm. In the absence of CTFs, Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes showed a somewhat variable behavior (Figure 4A; the data are an average of three experiments, including the one presented in Figure 1C). The conformational transition involved a temporary formation of an α-helical intermediate between 30 and 90 h, which decreased at later time points, concomitant with an increase in β-sheet content and a decline in statistical coil, as described previously for Aβ in the absence of Zn2+.59 In the presence of the CTFs, the variability between experiments was substantially lower, and the deconvolution showed only minor conformational changes during the reactions. In the presence of Aβ(39–42), which itself is expected to be unstructured,53 the mixture comprised ~40% each statistical coil and β-sheet, and ~20% α-helix, with minimal changes in these fractions for the duration of the experiment (Figure 4C). In the presence of Aβ(31–42), similar initial fractions were observed at t = 0 h. In the next 3 h, the abundance of β-sheet conformation increased to ~55%, and that of statistical coil decreased to ~35%, possibly reflecting formation of β-sheet in the CTF itself.53 Then, this trend was slowly reversed during the next 261 h, until the β-sheet and statistical coil fractions were again ~40% each. The α-helix fraction remained at ~20% throughout the entire reaction (Figure 4E). Aβ(30–40) caused formation of ~50% β-sheet immediately at t = 0 h, followed by a slow decrease to ~40% at 264 h, which was accompanied by minor increases in statistical coil, from 27% to 32%, and α-helix, from 21% to 28% (Figure 4G). Although the numbers generated by the deconvolution algorithm may not be precise, they provide an approximation of the contribution of each secondary structure component, supporting the conclusion that to a large extent the CTFs attenuated the conformational transition observed in Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes (Figures 1C and 4A).

Morphological analysis of the Aβ42-Zn2+ mixtures in the presence of each CTF at the end of the aggregation reaction showed mixtures of fibrillar and nonfibrillar structures (Figure 5). In all cases, the fibrils were shorter and less abundant than in mixtures of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes formed in the absence of CTFs. The shortest and thinnest fibrils appeared to form in the presence of Aβ(31–42) (Figure 5B), whereas the longest and most abundant fibrils formed in the presence of Aβ(30–40) (Figure 5C). These fibrils were still shorter than those formed by Aβ42 in the presence of Zn2+ in the absence of CTFs (Figure 1E), whereas in the presence of Aβ(39–42) an intermediate effect was observed. These results suggest that the C-terminal residues of Aβ42, namely, Ile41-Ala42, which are missing in Aβ(30–40), contribute to the interference of the CTFs with fibril formation. The relatively low abundance of the fibrils agreed, in general, with the CD spectroscopy data, though the differences in morphology among the mixtures containing different CTFs were more pronounced than the differences in conformational transition as reflected by the CD spectra.

CTFs Do Not Inhibit the Toxicity of Aβ42-Zn2+ Complexes.

We then used the LDH-release and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-reduction assays to assess if the addition of Zn2+ to Aβ42 would impact the inhibitory activity of CTFs. In our previous work, Aβ(31–42) and Aβ(39–42) were shown to inhibit the toxicity of 5 μM Aβ42 with half-maximal inhibition (IC50) values of 20 ± 4 and 47 ± 14 in the LDH-release assay,51 whereas Aβ(30–40) yielded IC50 = 29 ± 4 μM in the LDH assay under similar conditions.54 Remarkably, in the presence of Zn2+ (i.e., complexes comprising 5 μM Aβ42 and 10 μM Zn2+), all three CTFs lost completely their inhibitory activity even when used at 10-fold excess (20-fold excess in the case of Aβ(39–42), Figure 6), suggesting that the structures of the Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes and/or their interaction with the cells were distinct from those of Aβ42 oligomers formed in the absence of Zn2+.

CLR01 Modulates Aβ42 Assembly and Inhibits Its Toxicity in the Presence of Zn2+.

In light of these results, we asked whether other inhibitors acting by different mechanisms could still inhibit the formation or toxicity of the Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes and tested whether a similar loss of inhibition would be observed for the molecular tweezer CLR01. CLR01 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor,60–62 which previously has been shown to prevent the conformational change of Aβ42 in ThT-fluorescence and CD-spectroscopy assays and inhibit the toxicity of Aβ42 in differentiated PC-12 cells with IC50 = 52 ± 18 μM in the MTT-reduction assay.57 CLR01 is a particularly interesting test case for inhibiting the toxicity of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes, because it could target both Aβ42 and Zn2+ simultaneously. Its binding to Zn2+ was reported by Wilch et al., who discovered that CLR01 bound Zn2+ with a relatively high affinity, Kd = 5 μM, as opposed to a number of other metal ions, including Fe3+, Cu2+, Cs+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, for which CLR01 had low or no affinity.63 Interestingly, binding of CLR01 to Zn2+ appeared to be cooperative, rather than competitive, with binding to Lys. 1H NMR spectroscopy and fluorescence titrations suggested that CLR01 chelated Zn2+ by both phosphate groups while maintaining binding to a Lys side-chain inside its cavity.63 However, how simultaneous binding to Lys and Zn2+ affects the affinity of CLR01 for either ligand is not known.

The impact of 10, 30, or 100 μM CLR01 on temporal changes of ThT fluorescence in a solution of complexes made of 20 μM Aβ42 and 40 μM Zn2+ showed a rapid increase in ThT fluorescence without a lag phase, similar to Aβ42-Zn2+ in the absence of CLR01 (Figure 7A). The slope and final fluorescence value increased dose-dependently with CLR01 concentration. This behavior was distinct from the effect of CLR01 on the behavior of Aβ42 in the ThT-fluorescence assay in the absence of Zn2+, which was a typical inhibition, that is, a longer lag time, slower increase, and reduced final fluorescence at a 1:1 concentration ratio and near quantitative inhibition (no increase in fluorescence) at 3- or 10-fold excess CLR01.57 However, the rapid increase in ThT fluorescence without a lag phase, observed here upon addition of CLR01 to Aβ42 in the presence of Zn2+, was similar to the effect of CLR01 on ThT fluorescence in the presence of other amyloidogenic proteins for which the rapid increase in fluorescence correlated with formation of nonfibrillar structures,57,64 suggesting that, in this case as well, the fluorescence increase reported on formation of nonamyloid complexes. In support of this interpretation, CD spectroscopy showed that the conformational transition in the presence of low concentrations of CLR01, 10 or 30 μM (Figures 7B, C, respectively), resembled that of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes (Figure 1C) rather than that of Aβ42 alone (Figure 1B). In the presence of 100 μM CLR01, although a gradual change in the CD spectrum suggested a slow conformational change, the spectra were consistent with a statistical coil at all times and showed no formation of β-sheet. Thus, we conclude that, despite the sharp and rapid increase in ThT fluorescence in mixtures containing Aβ42, Zn2+, and CLR01, the fluorescence does not reflect formation of a cross-β structure. In agreement with this interpretation, the morphologies observed in the samples at the end of 14 d of incubation consisted of a mixture of short, thin fibrils and oligomer-like structures when CLR01 was present at a substoichiometric concentration (Figure 7E), whereas mostly oligomers and very rare fibrillar structures were observed in the presence of 30 or 100 μM CLR01 (Figures 7F and G, respectively.

Evaluation of the toxicity of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in the presence of increasing CLR01 concentrations using the MTT reduction assay showed that, unlike the CTFs, CLR01 effectively inhibited the toxicity of Aβ42 in the presence of Zn2+. Dose-Response analysis showed that the IC50 of CLR01 in this assay was 20 μM (Figure 7H). This value was ~2.5 times lower than the IC50 for CLR01 inhibition of Aβ42 in the absence of Zn2+, suggesting not only that CLR01 is a better inhibitor of the toxicity of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes than the CTFs but also that its ability to bind Zn2+ may act cooperatively with binding to Lys for inhibition of Aβ42-induced toxicity.

Our study of peptides derived from the C-terminus of Aβ42 and the molecular tweezer CLR01 show that, although the two types of compounds inhibit the toxicity of Aβ42 on its own in cell culture with half-maximal inhibition in the micromolar range, the CTFs completely lose their ability to inhibit the toxicity in the presence of Zn2+, whereas CLR01 not only remains an effective inhibitor but even gains inhibitory activity.

Biophysical investigation established that, under the conditions we used, the presence of Zn2+ altered the self-assembly of Aβ42 into formation of a mixture of fibrils and oligomers (Figure 1E), in which the β-sheet content was lower (Figure 1C) than in fibrils of Aβ42 in the absence of Zn2+ (Figure 1B). As we reported previously for Aβ40,30 Zn2+ altered dramatically the interaction of ThT with Aβ42. A rapid, relatively small increase in the fluorescence, without a lag phase, was observed in mixtures of Aβ42 and Zn2+, but it apparently reflected the formation of atypical ternary complexes in which presumably the ThT molecules were rather flat, leading to the observed increase in their fluorescence. This was evidenced by the absence of substantial β-sheet structure in the CD spectra at the corresponding time points. Similar to Aβ40-Zn2+ complexes, the Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes did not show toxicity when applied to cultured cells all at once, presumably due to rapid aggregation into benign structures.30 However, when the same total amount of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes was added in four portions over 36 h, their toxicity was substantially higher, likely because, under these conditions, the concentration of the complexes did not allow formation of large, nontoxic aggregates.

The behavior of the ThT fluorescence of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in the presence of the inhibitor compounds further supports the conclusion that this fluorescence did not reflect formation of β-sheet-rich fibrils. The only inhibitor that slightly reduced the fluorescence was Aβ(39–42) (Figure 3A), which previously had been shown not to affect the ThT increase upon fibrillation of Aβ42 in the absence of Zn2+.58 In contrast, Aβ(30–40), Aβ(31–42), and CLR01 all caused an immediate increase in the ThT fluorescence (Figures 3A and 7A) followed by gradual changes that did not correlate with the degree of β-sheet formation evidenced by CD spectroscopy (Figures 4 and 7B–D). We conclude that ThT fluorescence is not a reliable method for measurement of β-sheet formation or amyloid fibrils by Aβ42 (or Aβ4030) in the presence of Zn2+.

In contrast to the ThT fluorescence, the CD spectra did not seem to suffer from artifacts and reported on changes in the secondary structure of the Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes in a manner that appeared consistent with the morphological evaluation and toxicity measurement. As deconvolution algorithms rely on sampling of known structures and can lead to overfitting of the data, we focus the discussion on the spectral changes themselves. In the presence of fivefold excess of the CTFs (Figure 4B–G) or CLR01 (Figure 7B–D), little conformational change was observed over multiple days of incubation, suggesting that the peptides remained predominantly unstructured. Previously, little to no change was observed in solutions of Aβ(39–42) or Aβ(30–40) incubated on their own at ~200 μM, suggesting that these peptides did not form β-sheets, whereas Aβ(31–42) incubated at ~60 μM gradually formed β-sheet-rich fibrils over 48 h.53 Here, despite being used at a higher concentration, 100 μM, little conformational change was observed over time for all the CTFs, supporting the interpretation that they formed relatively stable ternary complexes with Aβ42 and Zn2+. The larger amplitude of the spectra in the presence of the CTFs, where the value of the minimum at 195 nm was 60–70 deg × cm2 dmol−1, in comparison to those in the presence of CLR01, where the minimum was ~40 deg × cm2 dmol−1, likely reflects the contribution of the CTFs themselves. This behavior suggested that all the inhibitors reduced the tendency of the Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes to form fibrils. Indeed, morphological analysis showed shorter, thinner, and less-abundant fibrils in the presence of the CTFs (Figure 3) than in their absence (Figure 1E). This effect was stronger in the presence of Aβ(31–42) and Aβ(39–42) than in the presence of Aβ(30–40), suggesting that the Ile41-Ala42 dipeptide contributed to the disruption of Aβ42-Zn2+ fibril formation. Inhibition of fibril formation by CLR01 was stronger than by the CTFs, even at low concentrations (cf. Figure 5 and Figure 7E–G). In the presence of all the inhibitors, the suppression of fibril formation appeared to increase the presence of oligomer-like structures.

In previous studies of the CTFs and CLR01 as inhibitors of Aβ42 self-assembly and toxicity, we proposed that all the inhibitors stabilized oligomeric structures (we termed them hetero-oligomers in the case of the CTFs51), which unlike the oligomers formed by Aβ42 itself, were nontoxic in multiple cell-culture systems.51,52,54,55,57,65,66 Here, we discovered that although both the CTFs and CLR01 appeared to suppress fibrillogenesis of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes, thereby increasing the relative abundance of nonfibrillar oligomers, the oligomers formed in the presence of the three CTFs maintained their toxicity (Figure 6), whereas those formed in the presence of CLR01 were nontoxic at concentrations of at least 30 μM (Figure 7H). This opposite effect of the addition of Zn2+ on the ability of the two types of inhibitors to suppress Aβ42 toxicity is remarkable and suggests that Aβ inhibitors evaluated in cell culture should be tested not only against the peptide itself but also against its complexes with Zn2+ and potentially with other metal ions. Our data also support further development of CLR01, because CLR01 inhibits the toxicity of Aβ42 both in the absence and in the presence of Zn2+. CLR01 is also an effective inhibitor of tau aggregation and spreading67,68 making a particularly attractive lead compound for development of AD therapy.

METHODS

All buffers were prepared using deionized water from a Milli-Q water purification system (Millipore) and analytical grade reagents. NaOH, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexa-fluoro-2-propanol (HFIP), and ZnCl2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. For cell culture, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (ThermoFisher Scientific) was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS) (ThermoFisher Scientific), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), and 2% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S, ThermoFisher). Synthetic human Aβ42 was from Anaspec. Aβ(39–42) and Aβ(30–40) were either prepared and purified in-house as described previously69 or obtained from New England Peptides. Aβ(31–42) was obtained from New England Peptides. CLR01 was prepared as described previously70 and purified as a sodium salt.

Sample Preparation for Biophysical Characterization.

Aβ42 was treated with HFIP to remove pre-existing aggregates as described previously.71 The resulting dry peptide film was dissolved in a 60 mM NaOH solution comprising 10% of the final volume and then diluted to 50% of the final volume using Milli-Q water, either alone or in the presence of Zn2+. Aβ42-Zn2+ mixtures were examined in the absence or presence of the CTFs or CLR01. The mixture solutions were sonicated for 1 min using a bath sonicator, and 50% of the final volume 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, was added so that the final PB concentration was 10 mM. Aβ42 concentration was confirmed by UV spectroscopy (ε = 1280 M−1 cm−1).

Sample Preparation for Cell Culture.

Aβ42 was pretreated with HFIP as described previously.71 The resulting peptide film was dissolved in 60 mM NaOH comprising less than 0.2% of the desired volume in the wells and sonicated for 1 min. Samples then were diluted to a stock concentration of 83 μM using differentiation media (0.5% FBS, 2% P/S in DMEM), and this solution then was added to the wells to yield a final concentration of 5 or 10 μM Aβ42. In our experience, different batches of Aβ42 often have vastly different toxicity. Therefore, we pretest each batch for its toxicity and use it at a concentration that yields 20–50% reduction of cell viability. CTFs and CLR01 solutions were prepared in a similar manner in differentiation media. Each CTF was tested at the following concentrations: 0.5, 1.5, 5, 15, and 50 μM. Thanks to its higher aqueous solubility,53 Aβ(39–42) also was tested at a maximal concentration of 100 μM. CLR01 was tested at 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μM. One or two microliters of a 1 mM ZnCl2 solution was added to each well, as appropriate, to yield a final concentration of 10 or 20 μM Zn2+.

Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assay.

ThT fluorescence was recorded as described previously.30 Fresh, 100 μL samples of 20 μM Aβ42 and 20 μM ThT in 10 mM PB, pH 7.4, were prepared in a 96-well plate in the absence or presence of 40 μM Zn2+ and 100 μM of each CTF or 10, 30, or 100 μM CLR01. In control experiments, the CTFs were incubated in the absence or presence of Zn2+ at the same concentrations in the absence of Aβ42. The samples were incubated inside BioTek Synergy HT or HTX Multi-Detection Microplate Readers at 37 °C with orbital shaking at 307 rpm, and ThT fluorescence was measured using excitation: 420/50 nm and emission: 485/20 nm every 15 min for the indicated times.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy.

Secondary structure analysis by CD was performed as described previously30 with some modifications. Briefly, fresh, 300–450 μL samples of 20 μM Aβ42 were prepared in the absence or presence of 100 μM of each CTF or CLR01 in 10 mM PB, pH 7.4. During preparation, a 1 mM Zn2+ solution was added to half of the samples to obtain a final concentration of 40 μM of Zn2+. The samples were incubated at 37 °C with rotational agitation, and CD spectra were recorded at different time points ranging from 0 (immediately after preparation) to 11 d. CD spectra were recorded using a J-810 Jasco spectropolarimeter and analyzed using SM2 software. The data were smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay algorithm72 set to a convolution width of 25. The spectra were deconvoluted using Bestel software.73 Each deconvolution curve is an average of two to three experiments.

Electron Microscopy.

The same samples used in the CD experiments were also used for EM. The samples were incubated at 37 °C with agitation and aliquots were taken for TEM examination at different time points up to 17 d. Ten microliter aliquots from each solution were deposited on carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. These samples were analyzed using a JEM1200-EX electron microscope (JEOL) operated at 120 kV. Images were recorded using a wide-angle BioScan 600W 1k × 1k digital camera and saved using digital micrograph acquisition software (Gatan).

Cell Viability Assays.

Cell viability assays were conducted as described previously51 with the following changes: Rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells were cultured in DMEM, containing 10% heat-inactivated HS, 5% FBS, and 1% P/S at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Only cells with a passage number between 9 and 15 were utilized for these experiments to minimize a potential phenotype drift due to a high passage number.74 Cells were plated at a density of 20 000 per well. Peptide solutions containing 5 or 10 μM Aβ42, 2 mol equiv of ZnCl2 (i.e., 10 or 20 μM, respectively), and increasing concentrations of CTFs or CLR01 were added to the cells. As has been reported previously,30 to observe the toxicity of Aβ42-Zn2+ complexes, fresh samples of each preparation, including Aβ42, Aβ42-Zn2+, or Aβ42-Zn2+ in the presence of CTFs or CLR01 were added to the cells every 12 h (i.e., at t = 0, 12, 24, and 36 h). At these time points, 12.5 μL of media were removed from each well, and 12.5 μL of fresh samples were added to each well. At t = 48 h, cell viability was determined using the lactate dehydrogenase release assay and/or the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay.
