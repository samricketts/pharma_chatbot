Summary

Epilepsy incidence and prevalence peaks in older adults, yet systematic studies of brain aging and epilepsy remain limited. We investigated topological network disruption in older adults with TLE (&gt;55 years). Additionally, we examined the potential network disruption overlap between TLE and mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), the prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s Disease. Measures of network integration (‘global path efficiency’) and segregation (‘transitivity and ‘modularity’) were calculated from cortical thickness covariance from 73 TLE, 79 aMCI, and 70 healthy controls. Compared to controls, TLE patients demonstrated abnormal measures of segregation (increased transitivity and decreased modularity) and integration (decreased global path efficiency). aMCI patients also displayed increased transitivity and decreased global path efficiency, but these differences were less pronounced than TLE._At the local level, TLE demonstrated decreased local path efficiency focused in the bilateral temporal lobes whereas aMCI had a more frontal-parietal distribution. These results suggest that network disruption at the global and local level is present in both disorders, but global disruption may be a particularly salient feature in older adults with TLE. These findings motivate further research into whether these network changes have distinct cognitive correlates or are progressive in older adults with epilepsy.


Introduction

Older adults represent the most rapidly growing segment of patients with epilepsy, with an incidence that peaks after 65 and a prevalence of 5–6 per 100 individuals1. This older cohort presents with increased risk for cognitive impairment2, pathological brain aging3, and development of progressive neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)4. In particular, the similarity in clinical presentation between AD’s prodromal stage, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) has drawn interest5–7. Combined with evidence of shared histopathology6, these similarities have led to theories of a bi-directional relationship between AD and TLE5.

Progressive atrophy, especially within the medial temporal lobe (MTL), has been reported in older adults with TLE3. Complementing regional analyses, TLE is characterized as a network disorder8. The subset of patients who display disrupted MTL network organization are associated with poor seizure outcomes following surgery9 and worse cognitive dysfunction10. aMCI/AD is also associated with MTL atrophy6 and network disruption, the latter of which has been associated with progressive cortical atrophy and cognitive decline11–13. Despite similarities in MTL regional atrophy, whether the network alterations observed in TLE and aMCI are similar has not been explored.

In this study, we compared both regional atrophy and gray matter topological network alterations of older patients (55–80 years old) with TLE and aMCI to older healthy controls (HC) to determine whether these two patient cohorts show similar patterns of structural network disruption.

Methods

Participants:

Institutional Review Boards at University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Emory University, Cleveland Clinic, and University of Wisconsin-Madison approved this study. Written informed consent was obtained from all TLE patients at UCSD, Emory, and UWM; at Cleveland Clinic, data were collected as part of an IRB-approved data registry. Seventy-three older adults with TLE met inclusion criteria. Patients were diagnosed with TLE by an epileptologist in accordance with the criteria defined by the International League Against Epilepsy14. All TLE patients were drug-resistant and all patients were over the age of 55 at the time of the pre-operative MRI; Seventy-two percent (N=53) of the patients subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery. Seventy-nine patients with aMCI and seventy older healthy controls were selected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Full details of ADNI, including inclusion criteria, can be found at loni.adni.usc.edu. Patient demographics are presented in Figure 1A and TLE patient clinical characteristics are presented in Figure 1B. Measures of episodic memory included Logical Memory Immediate (LM1) and Delayed (LM2) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Third Edition (WMS-III).

MRI Data Acquisition and Processing:

All T1-weighted MRI data for the TLE patients were obtained pre-operatively using a specialized epilepsy imaging sequence at one of the 4 epilepsy centers. Data from aMCI and HC were obtained from the ADNI database. All image processing and analyses occurred at the Center for Multimodal Imaging and Genetics Laboratory at UCSD using the exact same imaging analysis pipeline. In total, scanner strengths in each group were TLE (22/51 1.5T/3T), aMCI (42/37), and HC (25/45). Scanner Strength was included as a covariate in analyses (see Methods section ‘Statistical Analysis’).

Cortical surface reconstruction:

FreeSurfer v5.3 software was used to obtain cortical thickness estimates15. For surface-based analyses, group maps were created by resampling individual surfaces into a common spherical coordinate system that aligned cortical folding patterns across participants and were smoothed with a 16mm Gaussian kernel. For network ROIs, a modified Desikan-Killiany atlas was used in which long gyri were split into thirds to increase anatomical precision (Figure 1C). Visual inspection was performed on all images to identify topological defects, which were subsequently corrected with manual editing using established software guidelines (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu).

Network Analysis:

A 98 x 98 symmetric-weighted matrix of whole brain cortical thickness covariance was constructed for each group (Figure 1D). Because age differed between groups (see Results section ‘Group Demographics’), prior to the correlation analysis, a linear regression was performed at every ROI to remove the effects of age. Residuals of this regression were then substituted for the raw cortical thickness values16. Each value represents Pearson correlation strength between two ROIs within each group (TLE, aMCI, HC). Graph theoretical analyses were applied to the structural covariance matrix. We analyzed four graph theory-based measures which are sensitive to network-changes in TLE8 (Table 1): global path efficiency, local path efficiency, transitivity, and modularity17. Group differences in each measure were tested using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox17 for network densities 0.1 ≤ threshold ≤ 0.5 with a threshold increment of 0.05. Densities refer to correlation thresholds to determine connectivity (e.g., a density of .10 means that the top 10% of correlations are ‘connected’). Global path efficiency is a measure of global network integration and is defined as the average inverse shortest path length. Local path efficiency is calculated using the global efficiency from the adjacent subgraph of the ROI. Transitivity is a measure of network segregation, such that greater transitivity indicates a tendency for ROIs to be highly integrated within their local cluster. Transitivity is similar to clustering coefficient, but is normalized collectively for all ROIs so that the total number of ROIs does not influence measurement. Modularity describes the degree to which a network may be divided into non-overlapping groups with a high number of within-module connections and a low number of between-module connections.

Statistical Analysis:

For demographic variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher’s Exact tests were used. Surface maps were compared between each patient group and HC using vertex-wise analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) that included the covariates age, sex, education, and field strength (see Results section ‘Group Demographics”). Statistical correction was applied using cluster-based thresholding18; cluster-corrected p&lt;.05). For the graph theoretic measures, a sub-sampling methodology10 was used to estimate a spread of values for the HC group by using non-parametric permutation tests with 1000 permutations for each measure at each network density level. At each density, patient group values outside of the .0005 and .9995 percentile range (corresponding to a p-value of .001) were considered significantly different from HCs. This conservative approach was selected in order to protect against type 1 errors.

Results

Group Demographics:

Groups differed in age [F(2,219)=50.3, p&lt;.001] and education [F(2,219)=27.7, p&lt;001] but not sex [Fisher’s Exact: 1.95, p=.38]. Follow-up tests for age demonstrated HC (68.1 years) were older relative to TLE (61.2 years; p&lt;.001) and aMCI (63.7 years; p&lt;.001) patients. Follow-up tests for education demonstrated HC (16.3 years) had more education relative to TLE (13.4 years; p&lt;001), but not aMCI (16.4 years, p&gt;.05). For memory, significant ANCOVAs were observed across both cognitive measures [LM1: F(2, 209)=63.85, p&lt;.001; LM2: F(2, 209)=117.95, p&lt;.001]. Follow-up analyses revealed that patients with either TLE or MCI showed significantly worse performance across both tests relative to HC (all p&lt;001). On LM1 and LM2, 41% of TLE patients were classified as impaired.

Cortical Thickness:

There were no differences in average thickness in either hemisphere across the epilepsy centers in an ANCOVA with the covariates age, sex, education, and field strength [Left: F(3,66)=1.16, p=.33; Right: F(3,66)=1.20, p=.31]. Both TLE and aMCI groups showed prominent cortical thinning in bilateral MTL and inferotemporal regions (Figure 2A) compared to HC. Laterally, aMCI showed localized atrophy in lateral temporal, left posterior parietal, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, whereas TLE showed atrophy within anterior temporal and precentral cortex.

Structural Covariance Measures:

Globally, TLE had decreased global path efficiency across a range of network densities (.10-to-.30 and .50; p&lt;001), as well as increased transitivity (network densities: .10-to-.50; p&lt;.001) and decreased modularity (network densities: .10-to-.35 and .45-to-.50; p&lt;.001) relative to HC (Figure 2B: Table 1). aMCI showed similar, but more muted differences across a smaller range of densities for global path efficiency (.25-to-.50) and transitivity (.30-to-.50), but no differences from HC in modularity. When examining the local path efficiency of individual regions (Figure 2C), TLE patients showed reduced path efficiency clustered in anterior and ventral temporal regions, whereas aMCI displayed reduced path efficiency in bilateral frontal and parietal regions. Both groups displayed reduced efficiency in medial temporal-parietal/precuneus cortex.

Discussion

Older patients with TLE demonstrated similar but more pronounced global network alterations relative to aMCI despite both patient groups presenting a similar magnitude of MTL atrophy. Local path efficiency appeared to take a disease-specific regional pattern; in older adults with TLE reduced path efficiency centered within bilateral anterior and ventral temporal regions whereas in aMCI reduced path efficiency clustered in frontal-parietal cortex. These results suggest that network disruption at the global and local level is present in both disorders, but global disruption may be a particularly salient feature in older adults with TLE.

TLE is understood to represent a network disorder with alterations in whole-brain network topology8. In older patients with TLE, we report disrupted integration (decreased ‘global path efficiency’) and segregation (increased ‘transitivity’ and decreased ‘modularity’) of cortical networks. In our group of aMCI, we found a similar pattern of decreased integration and increased segregation. However, in aMCI these abnormalities emerged most strongly only at higher network densities whereas abnormality in TLE was pronounced across both low and high densities. The most apparent global difference was that in ‘modularity’ TLE had a decrease across densities whereas aMCI showed much smaller differences from HC. Modularity describes the extent to which networks can be organized into smaller sub-groups, a key measure of network efficacy and brain health19, necessary for a high level of local specialization needed for the demands of different cognitive processes. Therefore, the network in our TLE group was less organized into cohesive subdivisions than in HC and aMCI.

At a regional level, patterns of local path efficiency abnormality differed between TLE and aMCI. In TLE, local path efficiency decreases were mainly localized to bilateral anterior and ventral temporal regions whereas aMCI showed decreases predominately in bilateral frontal-parietal cortex. In middle-aged patients with TLE, abnormal network connectivity centered in bilateral temporal regions has previously been tied to worse post-surgical seizure outcome9. Increasingly impaired cognition in middle-aged TLEs has also been related to decreases in global path efficiency and modularity as well as increases in transitivity. Further, selective deficits in local path efficiency in the superior temporal gyrus were tied to a selective language impairment10. Although we describe a similar pattern of network changes in much older adults with TLE, the relative magnitude of these abnormalities across age and whether these network changes progress from middle to old age is unknown. In MCI, patients present intermediate network values between healthy controls and the more disrupted network values in AD in transitivity and modularity13. A relationship between worse network disruption in MCI and worse patient trajectories has been documented in measures of integration and segregation12. Therefore, network measures may contain information of clinical importance that may not be reflected in regional measures. Whether the network alterations reported here portend an unfavorable course in older adults with TLE is unclear. Emerging methods interrogate correlates of structural network disruption at the individual patient level. These methods may prove useful in understanding the clinical utility of structural network disruption to understanding the progression of network disruption in aging with epilepsy20. Future studies that analyze changes in white matter networks and neuropsychological measures longitudinally will also be useful for determining whether network aberrations can predict cognitive deterioration and disease trajectories for TLE.

With a rapidly aging population, increasing numbers of older patients are presenting with epilepsy. Progressive MTL cortical thinning has been reported in an older TLE cohort3, raising concerns that MTL atrophy could suggest a progressive disease course in some patients. Here, the older TLE cohort demonstrated topological network alterations that are as striking as those seen in aMCI, but with unique features. Comparisons across neurological disorders could be helpful for identifying common mechanisms underlying similar clinical presentations that may suggest similar disease trajectories and/or treatment strategies5. With the strong emphasis on early identification and treatment of preclinical neurodegenerative disorders, cross-disease approaches offer the chance to migrate therapies. However, successful translation will be aided by thorough characterizations of the overlaps and divides across diseases. Our study provides evidence that gray matter network disruption is common to both disorders, but with subtle differences. However, the pathological processes contributing to the structural network abnormalities in these patient groups is unknown. Further, as our TLE cohort represented pharmacoresistant patients, it is unknown if these structural network abnormalities would be present in a more benign cohort. A final limitation is that we combined scans across multiple sites which may have increased variance in our estimates which may have attenuated some effects. Given the phenotypic heterogeneity in epilepsy10 and the range in our cohort’s patient characteristics in measures such as age of onset, it is likely that there may be multiple underlying disease courses to be disentangled in TLE5.
