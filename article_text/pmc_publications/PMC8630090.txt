Introduction:

PET imaging for neurofibrillary tau allows investigation of the in vivo spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. We evaluated the suitability of 18F-MK-6240 in a clinical sample, and determined the relationships among 18F-MK-6240 binding, age, cognition, and CSF-based Alzheimer’s biomarkers.

Methods:

Participants (n=101, 72±9 years, 52% women) underwent amyloid PET, tau PET, structural T1-weighted MRI, and neuropsychological evaluation. Twenty-one participants had lumbar puncture for CSF measurement of Aβ42, tau, and phospho-tau.

Results:

18F-MK-6240 recapitulated Braak staging and correlated with CSF tau and phospho-tau, normalized to Aβ42. 18F-MK-6240 negatively correlated with age across Braak regions in amyloid-positive participants, consistent with greater tau pathology in earlier onset AD. Domain-specific, regional patterns of 18F-MK-6240 binding were associated with reduced memory, executive, and language performance, but only in amyloid-positive participants.

Discussion:

18F-MK-6240 can approximate Braak staging across the Alzheimer’s continuum and provide region-dependent insights into biomarker-based Alzheimer’s models.


pmcINTRODUCTION

Neurofibrillary tau is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[1], and the extent of deposition in brain correlates with clinical severity[2]. While amyloid deposition is detectable using clinically approved PET radioligands[3–5], up to 30% of cognitively normal elders are amyloid-positive on PET[6, 7], and amyloid-positivity is frequently seen in non-AD diagnoses such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy[8] and dementia with Lewy bodies[9]. Consequently, PET with radioligands specific to paired helical filament (PHF) tau may offer pathological specificity for AD in patients with unclear diagnosis.

18F-Flortaucipir is the first tau radioligand with sufficient specificity to distinguish tau tangles from amyloid plaques[10], and its spatial distribution of binding approximates expected tau pathology based on Braak staging[11]. However, 18F-flortaucipir has off-target binding in basal ganglia and choroid plexus[12, 13], the latter having potential to influence PET signal in medial temporal structures proximal to the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles[14].

18F-MK-6240 is an improved tau radioligand without appreciable off-target binding in basal ganglia and choroid plexus, but variable off-target binding in meningeal melanocytes[15]. 18F-MK-6240 binding is elevated in AD patients, and simplified measures such as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) correlate with results from kinetic modeling[15–17]. 18F-MK-6240 can also quantify tau burden in asymptomatic older adults[18, 19]. However, whether 18F-MK-6240 recapitulates pathological Braak-like spread of tau across the AD disease continuum, and whether this radioligand can distinguish clinically diagnosed AD patients with biomarker evidence of Alzheimer’s pathophysiology from those without biomarker positivity, is not fully known. In addition, to our knowledge, no published study has yet established if 18F-MK-6240 binding correlates with CSF biomarkers of AD severity. Even with only a few published studies, this tracer is already being used as an outcome measure in drug development, and further evaluation of 18F-MK-6240 is critical to put clinical trial endpoints into context. We sought to determine if tau binding with 18F-MK-6240 PET follows a pattern of progression along the clinical AD continuum, using a cross-sectional design and stratifying participants by amyloid status. We hypothesized that higher 18F-MK-6240 binding would be associated with amyloid-positivity, older age, and worse cognition. We additionally sought to determine the relationship between 18F-MK-6240 binding and CSF concentrations of Aβ42, tau, and phospho-tau, and investigated the potential of using 18F-MK-6240 for tau-positivity classification.

METHODS

Participant selection

Participants were age 50 years or older and had 18F-florbetaben or 18F-florbetapir PET for amyloid determination, brain MRI, and standardized neuropsychological testing. Participants were selected from five separate research cohorts at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Recruitment and selection procedures are detailed in Supplementary Methods. Clinical information (blind to amyloid PET) was used to identify 1) participants who met clinical criteria for either amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)[20] or mild AD[21] (“patients”), and 2) participants free of cognitive complaints, with history and neuropsychological test scores confirming absence of clinically meaningful impairment (“controls”). Amyloid PET images were used to stratify participants as amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative. Thus, four groups were created (amyloid-negative controls, amyloid-positive controls, amyloid-positive patients, and amyloid-negative patients). All participants (or their representative) provided informed consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki and study procedures were approved by local Institutional Review Boards.

Since 18F-MK-6240 is a relatively novel tau PET radiotracer, we explored regional thresholds for “tau-positivity.” We selected an independent sample of 100 cognitively-normal, amyloid-negative participants from the Northern Manhattan Study of Mind and Metabolism (NOMEM; NIH R01AG050440) to determine the expected distribution of 18F-MK-6240 SUVR in a community-based cohort of middle-aged adults without evidence of Alzheimer’s pathophysiology (Supplementary Table 1). The threshold for “tau-positivity” was defined as 2 standard deviations (SD) above the mean 18F MK-6240 SUVR for each brain region. Thresholds of 1 or 3 SD above the mean were explored.

Amyloid PET imaging

All participants underwent amyloid PET imaging with either 18F-florbetaben (FBB, n=63, target dose=8.0mCi±10%) or 18F-florbetapir (FBP, n=38, target dose=10.0mCi±10%) to determine amyloid status. All amyloid scans were performed on a Siemens Biograph64 mCT/PET scanner (iterative reconstruction algorithm; voxel size: 1.6×1.6×1mm3; all corrections performed). However, because participants had amyloid PET under separate feeder studies, 57 participants had FBB images acquired 50–70 min post-injection and 6 participants had images acquired 90–110 min post-injection. All FBP images were acquired 50–70 min post-injection. Because of the different radioligands and acquisition windows, a binary visual read was used to determine the presence or absence of fibrillar amyloid plaque. These reads were performed by an experienced neurologist (WCK) or nuclear medicine physician (AM) blinded to diagnosis and trained in interpretation of amyloid imaging for each radioligand. We previously validated visual determination of amyloid status using FBB against an SUVR threshold[22].

Structural T1 MRI imaging

All participants underwent T1-weighted MRI scanning in a 3T scanner and scans were anatomically segmented with FreeSurfer 6.0 into subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs were combined to create composite “Braak stage” regions (Supplementary Table 2), based on staging of neurofibrillary tangle deposition at autopsy[1]. Because prior studies showed variable topographic patterns of tau binding in the neocortex in early AD patients[23, 24], we also combined neocortical Freesurfer regions to create composite ROIs for frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Results are reported for the composite Braak regions and for individual neocortical and medial temporal regions.

Tau PET imaging

All participants underwent 18F-MK-6240 PET imaging in a Siemens Biograph64 mCT/PET scanner (target dose=5mCi±10%; iterative reconstruction algorithm; voxel size: 1×1×2mm3; all corrections performed). Emission scans were acquired, capturing at minimum 90–110 min post-injection in 5-min frames. We chose the 90–110 min acquisition window because of improved time-stability of these later time points[16] and good test-retest reliability of SUVRs starting at 90 min post-injection[25]. SUVRs were calculated in native PET space using a reference region derived from inferior cerebellar gray matter to avoid spill-in from occipital cortex and off-target binding in the falx cerebelli[15] (Supplementary Methods). For ROI-based analysis, mean SUVRs were calculated using FreeSurfer ROIs in native PET space. For voxelwise analysis, 18F-MK-6240 SUVR images were spatially normalized (Montreal Neurological Institute space; using co-registered T1 MRI) and smoothed (8mm).

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis

A subset of 21 participants (4 amyloid-negative controls, 5 amyloid-positive controls, 9 amyloid-positive patients, and 3 amyloid-negative patients) underwent a lumbar puncture. CSF concentrations of amyloid-β (Aβ42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) were measured using the micro-bead-based multiplex immunoassay (INNO-BIA AlzBio3 RUO test; Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium)[26] on the Luminex platform. Our analyses used unnormalized CSF concentrations of Aβ42, total tau, and p-tau181, as well as CSF total tau and p-tau181 normalized to Aβ42[27].

APOE genotyping

A subset of 45 participants (8 amyloid-negative controls, 8 amyloid-positive controls, 21 amyloid-positive patients, 8 amyloid-negative patients) underwent blood collection and the SNPs rs7412 and rs429358 in APOE were genotyped with KASPar® PCR SNP genotyping system (LGC Genomics, Hoddesdon, Herts, UK). Genotype-data for these two SNPs were used to unambiguously define ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles.

Statistical Analysis

Participants were stratified by amyloid and cognitive status. Demographic characteristics and frequencies of tau-positivity were compared across groups with ANOVAs or Chi-squared tests. Group differences in 18F-MK-6240 were determined on a voxel level using SPM12, adjusting for age and sex to additionally investigate differences in non-Braak stage regions or regions of potential off-target binding. The Desikan-Killiany atlas was used to identify the regions within significant clusters. For correlation analyses, ROI-level general linear models were first run in all participants, then stratified by amyloid and cognitive status. Age-associations were adjusted for Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score and sex. To further explore the relationship between 18F-MK-6240 binding and cognition, we performed correlation analysis using age-, sex-, and education-adjusted z-scores from domain-specific neuropsychological tests performed in the majority of participants, namely Selective Reminding Test-delayed recall (memory, n=63), Trail Making Test Part B (executive function, n=59), and Category Fluency (language, n=99). Voxelwise general linear models were used to capture any potential unilaterality. Because of the small number of participants who had lumbar puncture, correlation analyses of CSF measures were performed without stratification or adjustment. Corrections for multiple comparisons were performed using the false discovery rate (FDR) in ROI-based analyses[28] with p&lt;0.05 considered significant. For voxelwise comparisons, exploratory thresholds for significance were set to p&lt;0.001 without family-wise error (FWE) correction or p&lt;0.05 with FWE correction.

RESULTS

Participants were recruited from Northern Manhattan and demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1. Our participants included individuals who self-identified as Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, or Hispanic and included individuals with a range of education from 0 to 23 years of schooling. Amyloid-negative patients were older than amyloid-positive patients; however, there were no differences in education, sex, or APOE-ε4 allelic frequency between groups. As expected, both amyloid-positive patients and amyloid-negative patients had lower MMSE and memory scores than the control groups. Amyloid-positive patients had lower executive and language scores than all other groups. Amyloid-negative patients had lower language scores than amyloid-negative controls.

18F-MK-6240 binding across the AD continuum

In our ROI-based analysis, we compared the frequency of tau-positivity among the four participant groups. Using a threshold based on SUVRs 2 SD above mean binding in the independent healthy cohort, we found that amyloid-negative controls were least likely of the four groups to have tau-positivity in any Braak stage (Fig 1, Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, 9% of amyloid-negative controls were tau-positive in the amygdala alone, which is Braak stage III pathologically (Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, almost half of amyloid-positive controls were tau-positive in Braak stage I, with lower frequencies of tau-positivity in higher Braak regions. Greater than 80% of amyloid-positive patients were tau-positive in Braak I-IV, with 74% in Braak V and 58% in Braak VI. Less than 40% of amyloid-negative patients were tau-positive in any Braak stage; however, the frequency of tau-positivity was greater than that for amyloid-negative controls in Braak II-IV. Using thresholds of 1 or 3 SD minimally affected the frequency of tau-positivity among amyloid-positive patients (Supplementary Table 3). Presence or absence of medial temporal binding was visually apparent in most participants (see Supplementary Fig 2, 3, and 5).

Voxelwise analysis (Fig 2) showed that 18F-MK-6240 binding was greater in amyloid-positive controls than in amyloid-negative controls, with group differences in limbic (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampus) and medial temporal cortex (entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and inferior, middle, and superior temporal cortex) with smaller clusters in later Braak regions (posterior cingulate, precuneus, inferior and superior parietal, lateral occipital, lateral orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and superior frontal cortices). 18F-MK-6240 binding was greater in amyloid-positive patients than in amyloid-positive controls in fusiform gyrus, inferior, middle, and superior temporal cortex, inferior and superior parietal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Finally, 18F-MK-6240 binding was greater in amyloid-positive patients than in amyloid-negative controls in widespread clusters that included amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, inferior, middle, and superior temporal cortex, frontal cortex, and parietal cortex. Differences in 18F-MK-6240 binding were not found in sensorimotor and occipital cortices in any of the comparisons. 18F-MK-6240 binding was greater in amyloid-positive patients than in amyloid-negative patients in the left hemisphere in the amygdala, hippocampus, inferior, middle, and temporal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and inferior parietal cortex. There were no significant differences between amyloid-negative patients and amyloid-positive controls, or between amyloid negative-patients and amyloid-negative controls.

Visual inspection of PET images showed that, cross-sectionally, participants demonstrated a progression of increased 18F-MK-6240 binding, where signal tended to appear first in medial temporal cortex among amyloid-positive controls, then in lateral temporal cortex and posteromedial parietal cortex among amyloid-positive early MCI patients, and ultimately spreading throughout neocortex in amyloid-positive late MCI and mild AD dementia patients (Supplementary Fig 4). We did not detect appreciable off-target binding in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or choroid plexus, though there was variable off-target binding in the meninges.

Relationship between 18F-MK-6240 binding, age, and overall cognition

Across all participants, greater 18F-MK-6240 binding was associated with lower age in all Braak stages, with the largest effect in Braak stage V (r = −0.52 to −0.22; p=6E-8 to 0.03; all surviving FDR, Fig 3). This relationship was driven by amyloid-positive participants, as analysis restricted to this group showed associations between greater binding and lower age in all Braak stages (all surviving FDR). There was higher binding in Braak stage I in women compared to men (0.88 [0.40, 1.4], p=0.001) in amyloid-positive participants above and beyond the effects of age and MMSE. We found no association between 18F-MK-6240 binding and age when only amyloid-negative participants (i.e., controls and patients) were included in analysis. When we restricted the analysis to amyloid-negative controls only, greater 18F-MK-6240 binding in Braak stages II and III was associated with higher age; however, neither survived FDR correction.

Across all participants, greater 18F-MK-6240 binding in all Braak stages was associated with lower MMSE scores, with the largest effect in Braak stage IV (r = −0.59 to −0.47; p=2E-10 to 2E-6; all surviving FDR). In amyloid-positive participants, higher 18F-MK-6240 binding was associated with lower MMSE score in all Braak stages (r = −0.63 to −0.36; p =1E-6 to 0.007; all surviving FDR). In amyloid-negative participants, we found that greater 18F-MK-6240 binding in all Braak stages was associated with lower MMSE scores (r = −0.37 to −0.33; p=0.02 to 0.04); with associations in Braak stages I, III, and V surviving FDR correction. We found no association between 18F-MK-6240 binding and MMSE score in amyloid-negative controls alone.

Relationship between 18F-MK-6240 binding and cognitive domains

In voxelwise analysis, there were negative associations with cognitive scores across all participants. Stratifying by amyloid-positivity, we found no associations with cognitive scores in amyloid-negative participants, and negative associations in the amyloid-positive participants (Fig 4). Greater 18F-MK-6240 binding was associated with lower memory scores (largest clusters in hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and temporal cortex); with lower language scores (largest clusters in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, with left &gt; right asymmetry); and with lower executive function scores (largest clusters in frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices).

Relationship between 18F-MK-6240 binding and CSF biomarkers

While greater 18F-MK-6240 binding was associated with lower concentrations of CSF Aβ42 in all Braak stages (r = −0.46 to −0.64, p=0.002 to 0.04), no associations were found with unnormalized CSF concentrations of total tau (r=0.11 to 0.24, p=0.24 to 0.64) or phospho-tau (r=0.17 to 0.39, p=0.08 to 0.47). 18F-MK-6240 binding showed stronger associations with CSF total tau/Aβ42 in Braak stages I-IV (r=0.52 to 0.71, p=3E-4 to 0.02) and phospho-tau/Aβ42 in Braak stages I-V (r=0.47 to 0.70, p=4E-4 to 0.03; Fig 5). These correlations survived multiple comparisons correction.

DISCUSSION

In this cross-sectional study of older diverse adults from Northern Manhattan, we found that 18F-MK-6240 binding increases in magnitude and spatial distribution across the AD continuum, following a Braak-like progression. This pattern of progression was visually evident in individual scans and confirmed by the region-specific differences in the frequency of tau-positivity after stratifying participants by cognitive and amyloid status. In addition, our voxelwise analyses showed no evidence of off-target binding in gray matter regions typically spared in AD. We also found that greater 18F-MK-6240 binding was associated with younger age and worse cognition in amyloid-positive participants. Greater 18F-MK-6240 binding was also associated with lower CSF Aβ42 and larger ratios of CSF t-tau and p-tau to CSF Aβ42. Overall, these results suggest 18F-MK-6240 has excellent sensitivity for detecting early tau pathology and monitoring its progression.

In evaluating regional patterns of tau binding, 18F-MK-6240 binding was increased in early Braak regions among amyloid-positive controls on group-level voxlewise analyses (Fig 3), and visibly detectable on single participant images (Supplementary Fig 2–4). These results argue that 18F-MK-6240 has adequate sensitivity to detect early tangle accumulation. We observed a low frequency of tau-positivity among amyloid-negative controls, consistent with results from earlier studies using 18F-flortaucipir that show occasional tau binding in cognitively normal controls[29, 30]. In addition, the frequency of tau-positivity in all our cognitive controls combined (amyloid-negative and amyloid-positive) was within the expected range reported in autopsy studies, where 20–30% of cognitively normal adults demonstrate tau pathology[31]. However, the use of different methods to define tau- and amyloid-positivity are expected to result in discrepancies in reported prevalence in imaging studies. While our results converge with those of other studies suggesting that the spread of tau beyond the medial temporal cortex after amyloid-positivity is a critical point, ultimately, tau-positivity cutoffs should be determined in the context of autopsy studies for validation against gold standard.

We found a potential dissociation in region and directionality of the relationship between 18F-MK-6240 binding and age, based on amyloid and cognitive status, which may suggest two separate relationships between age of symptom onset and extent of tau deposition. Greater binding was associated with younger age in amyloid-positive patients, consistent with 18F-flortaucipir studies showing high cortical tau signal in early onset AD patients[24, 29, 32–34]. Early onset AD patients have more extensive FDG hypometabolism[35] and cortical atrophy[36] than late onset AD patients. These observations likely reflect that either early onset AD is associated with more aggressive disease course, or that late onset patients have sufficient age-related co-pathology (e.g., TDP-43, α-synuclein, arteriosclerosis) that less tangle pathology is required to cause impairment. Among amyloid-negative controls, greater 18F-MK-6240 binding was associated with older age in early Braak regions with small-to-moderate effect size; however, these results did not survive multiple comparisons correction. A larger study is needed to validate this relationship, but an amyloid-independent age association with medial temporal tau aggregation would be consistent with results from a large autopsy study showing neurofibrillary tangles are more prevalent with advancing age, and that tau deposition in early Braak regions are found in absence of amyloid plaque pathology[37]. In addition, primary age-related tauopathy has been described pathologically in unimpaired individuals[38, 39]. Therefore, the increased 18F-MK-6240 binding in older amyloid-negative controls may represent the increased likelihood of limbic tau with advancing age, not necessarily associated with cognitive decline.

Regional patterns of 18F-MK-6240 binding largely corresponded with impairment in corresponding cognitive domains. For example, binding in hippocampus, left temporal cortex, and frontal cortex correlated with worse performance on memory, language, and executive tests, respectively. However, the spatial extent of these correlations went beyond the regions underlying performance on these tasks. For example, impaired memory performance was also associated with greater binding in frontal cortices, and language performance was associated with greater binding in left neocortical regions. These findings could be due to the sensitivity of 18F-MK-6240 in that tau aggregation is expected to precede the neurodegeneration that underlies cognitive dysfunction[31]. Our cross-sectional results may also have been influenced by patients with multi-domain impairment and widespread 18F-MK-6240 binding. In these patients, poor performance in any cognitive domain would be expected to correlate with greater binding across several brain regions (e.g., patients with low memory and executive scores with increased 18F-MK-6240 in both medial temporal and frontal regions would show correlations between memory impairment and binding in frontal cortex, and between executive impairment and binding in medial temporal cortex).

18F-MK-6240 binding correlated with CSF Aβ42, total tau/Aβ42, and phospho-tau/Aβ42, but not total tau and phospho-tau alone. CSF-based biomarkers reflect soluble units that have not yet accumulated into fibrillar forms recognized by PET radioligands[31, 40]. This temporal gap likely adds variance to correlations between PET-based and CSF-based biomarkers, as suggested by a 18F-flortaucipir study showing only moderate associations between PET binding and CSF total tau and phospho-tau[41]. The association between 18F-MK-6240 binding and CSF Aβ42 (and ratio values using CSF Aβ42) may relate to the ability of CSF Aβ42 to discriminate AD and non-AD patients. Because our analysis included participants without stratification of cognitive or amyloid status, those with lower CSF Aβ42 were more likely to have AD pathology and therefore expected to have greater 18F-MK-6240 binding. Notably, a prior study found a negative association between 18F-flortaucipir binding and CSF Aβ42 in a mixed sample of AD and non-AD patients, but not in amyloid-positive AD patients alone[42]. A larger sample size is needed to determine if the association between 18F-MK-6240 binding and CSF Aβ42 remains significant within discrete participant groups.

Our conclusions are limited by our sample size and lack of autopsy confirmation. Visual reads rather than quantitative thresholds were used to determine amyloid-positivity, as participants were selected from feeder studies that used different amyloid radioligands and imaging windows; we were prevented from quantitation using a harmonization method such as Centiloid conversion, as Centiloid methodology has not been developed for FBB imaging from 50–70 min post-injection. However, our visual reads are unlikely to have biased group assignment considering the high concordance with SUVR thresholds[22, 43]. Partial volume effect correction was not reported, but would likely increase the difference in tau between diagnostic groups; however, it may have the benefit of reducing the potential contribution of off-target, neuromelanin-related binding to neocortical regions. Therefore, larger studies with pathological correlation are warranted. Despite our limitations, these early results demonstrate the potential for 18F-MK-6240 for in vivo measurement of tau pathology, particularly at early stages of disease.

In conclusion, 18F-MK-6240 binding recapitulates Braak staging in vivo, and correlates with amyloid-positivity, CSF AD biomarkers, cognition, and clinical diagnosis. 18F-MK-6240 appears to demonstrate advantages of in vivo quantification of tau pathology with high sensitivity for changes in medial temporal lobe, which may be due to its lack of off-target binding in choroid plexus.
