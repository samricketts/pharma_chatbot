Aβ immunotherapies with anti-Aβ antibody responses have high potential as possible prevention treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. We have previously shown that active DNA Aβ1–42 immunization via gene gun delivery led to a non-inflammatory immune response resulting in decreased Aβ levels in brains of an immunized AD mouse model. To make DNA vaccination more applicable for clinical use, we used here intradermal electroporation. With fine tuning of the electropulse parameters, high antibody levels and low levels of inflammatory cytokines in the cellular immunoassays were observed. Full-length DNA Aβ1–42 immunization delivered via electroporation has potential to be used in the clinical setting.

1. Introduction:

A major challenge of our society is finding a prevention treatment or cure for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Treatment options are only symptomatic and shown some improvement in the early stage of the disease, but there is currently no effective treatment addressing underlying causes nor is there a cure for AD. As AD is the leading form of age-related dementia and with an increase of life expectancy worldwide, the social and economic burden from this disease will increase dramatically. It is projected that the number of people age 65 and older who have Alzheimer’s disease in the United States may triple, from 5.1 million in 2015 to 13.8 million by 2050 (1). AD is a slow and in regard to clinical findings very variable disease. AD pathogenesis has been associated with the accumulation, aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta, Aβ) peptides and hyperphoshorylation of tau in the brain. The amyloid cascade hypothesis postulates that Aβ deposition is an initial event in a multifactoral pathogenesis, and studies have shown that Aβ deposition precedes AD symptoms by at least 20 years (2–5). Therapy approaches using active and passive immunizations against Aβ have a high possibility to be effective in removing amyloid from brain, and might thus prevent or lessen downstream pathology. Since 2000 a number of clinical trials for AD immunotherapy have started, have failed, and are continued (6–15). In one of the most recent clinical trials using passive immunization with an antibody that targets aggregated Aβ, soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils Aβ42, the results in patients with prodromal or mild AD showed that brain Aβ had been reduced in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In addtion after a year of monthly intravenous infusions of this antibody, functional benefits such as slowing of clinical decline were measured leading to continuation of this treatment into a Phase 3 clinical trial (16).

Arguments for the lack of more definitive positive results from the completed clinical trials in AD (active and passive immunizations) are that treatment was started too late (17). Studies started in 2013 have the focus on therapy in patient cohorts before the onset of clinical symptoms of AD (17–19). When these prevention studies using mainly passive immunizations with anti-Aβ antibodies and β secretase inhibitors provide functional benefits for AD patients and delays in onset of the disease, the development of active immunotherapy will be in demand as active vaccinations can be applied easier and more economically to large populations.

Immunization against a self-antigen is challenging as it might cause autoimmune inflammation as in did in AN1792 (6–8). Using DNA Aβ1–42 immunization into the skin with a ballistic device, the Helios gene gun, we showed a predominantly Th2-type antibody response indicative of a non-inflammatory immune response and the disappearance of an Aβ42 specific T cell response at later immunization time points (20–26). Therefore, the immune response following DNA immunization differs quantitatively and qualitatively from the immune response elicited by Aβ1–42 peptide immunization and DNA Aβ1–42 immunization has high potential to be both, safe and effective. DNA immunization is relatively inexpensive compared to peptide vaccines (27, 28). Over the last decade substantial progress has been made especially in increasing the effectiveness of the DNA delivery and thus in eliciting an immune response. DNA delivery via electroporation had been shown to be superior due to its high degree of malleability. More than fifty clinical trials have been reported which use DNA transfer via electroporation in patients (27). Electroporation greatly enhances DNA immunogenicity in human clinical settings (28). DNA electroporation has been reported as highly tolerable by the patients without negative side effects. Most of these trials are performed in melanoma cancer patients and DNA is been injected directly into the tumor or skin lesions. A second group of clinical trials using DNA vaccination via electroporation is focused on the treatment of infectious diseases such as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), Hepatitis or Human Papillloma Virus caused cancers to generate a protective immune response against the virus. To proceed into a possible clinical use of prophylactic DNA Aβ42 immunization in AD patients, we need to continue with basic research on the use of an electroporation device (29–32). We analyzed here the use of DNA electroporation immunization with our dual plasmid system in wild-type mice. We tested a variety of different pulse parameter settings, and show here the fine tuning and optimization of the electro pulse protocols to achieve a similar immune response to the one we have described for DNA Aβ1–42 gene gun immunizations.

2. Material and methods:

2.1. Mice and immunizations:

Balb/c-Foxp3 EGFP transgenic mice were immunized for six immunization time points with DNA Aβ42 trimer (20, 21) using electroporation with various pulse conditions. Twelve different conditions were tested consisting of combinations of high and low voltage pulses, different pulse frequencies, pulse intervals, and pulse durations (Table 1). High voltage pulses were Applied to open up the cell membranes in the target area (925 or 1,125 V/cm), followed by lower voltage pulses for DNA delivery into the cells (475, 275, 200, or 125 V/cm). Mice were anesthetized, and 10 μg of DNA were intradermally injected followed by application of the respective electropulses with a pulse generator (AgilePulse ID system, BTX Harvard apparatus). No adjuvant to boost the immune responses was used. Control mice received PBS injections followed by electroporation. Other control groups received either DNA Aβ1–42 immunizations delivered with the gene gun (4 μg DNA per mouse per immunization, no adjuvant), or Aβ1–42 peptide immunizations (100 μg peptide plus QuilA adjuvant, i.p. injections). In groups C2 and C3 a four needle array was tested (2×4, 2 mm in length, 0.3 mm Ø, 4 mm gap between the needles). In all other groups a six needle array had been used (2×6, 2 mm in length, 0.3 mm Ø, 4 mm gap between the needles). All groups of mice consisted of four to five animals, which were housed together during the entire time of the experimental procedures. Two different mouse strains, B6/129 F2 and B6/C3F2, were used to analyze the immune responses in different genetic backgrounds and different MHC hapotypes.

2.2. ELISAs:

Antibody concentrations in mouse plasma were measured with standard ELISA assays and determined as μg anti-Aβ42 IgG/ml plasma. Aβ peptides were purchased from rPeptide, AnaSpec, Bachem, and and were used at concentrations of 2 μg/ml in coating buffer. Antibody isotypes binding to Aβ42 were measured with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG1, and goat anti-mouse IgG2a and IgG2c (Balb/c mice possess the Igh1-a allele, B6/129F2 mice carry both alleles, Igh1-a and Igh1-b, 33, 34), goat anti-mouse IgG2b, and goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology) followed by Avidin-HRP incubation and TMB detection.

IgA antibodies were assayed with two secondary anti-mouse IgA antibodies: goatanti-mouse IgA (Southern Biotechnology) and rat-anti-mouse IgA (Biolegend).

2.3. ELISPOT assays:

ELISPOT assays to determine frequencies of cytokine secreting cells were performed according to standard procedures and as previously described using commercial available antibody sets for mouse IFNγ, IL-17, and IL-4 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) (22, 23). 106 splenocytes were added per well and were cultured in medium only, or re-stimulated with Aβ42 peptides, and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 48 hours. For maximal T cell stimulation an anti-CD3ε antibody (clone 145–2C11, eBioscience) was used at 0.5 μg/ml in the cell cultures. Spots were counted with an automated ELISPOT plate reader (Bioreader 5000, Biosys, Karben / Germany).

2.4. T cell proliferation after Aβ peptide re-stimulation in-vitro:

T cell proliferation was measured with flow cytometry. Splenocyte cultures were restimulated with Aβ1–42 peptide for 72h. To analyze numbers of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (Tregs) in these cultures, the cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies for T cell markers CD4 and CD25. Foxp3 positive cells were analyzed without staining in FL1 for the EGFP labeled transgene in this mouse strain. Fluorescence was measured using an Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (Ann Arbor, MI) and analyzed with CFlow Plus and FCS Express Version 3 software programs (25).

2.5. Immunohistochemistry of APP transgenic mouse brains:

Sagittal parallel sections of paraformaldehyde fixed mouse brains (3xTg-AD, 20 and 24 months old, and F1 C3H/APPswePS1Δ9,16 months old) were stained with antibodies specific for Aβ1–42 (McSA1, Medimabs, Canada) to detect amyloid plaques in hippocampus and cortex of the mice following standard procedures. Parallel sections were stained with immune sera from mice which had received DNA Aβ42 trimer immunizations via electroporation (dilution 1:100) and a commercially available mouse anti-human Aβ monoclonal antibody. In the fluorescent staining, mouse antibody binding was detected with rabbit-anti-mouse IgG and rat-anti-mouse IgA secondary antibodies, which were visualized with AF488 labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG and AF695 labeled goat-anti-rat IgG antibodies. Whole brain sections were scanned using a NanoZoomer digital pathology system and analyzed with NDP viewer software (Hamamatzu, Japan), or an Axioscan system and Zen lite software (Zeiss, Germany).

2.6. Statistics:

GraphPad Prism version 6 for Windows was used for statistics (unpaired Student t test with two tailed p values, non-parametric Mann-Whitney u test, column statistics, San Diego, CA, www.graphpad.com). P-values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.

3. Results:

3.1. Antibody levels and isotypes

DNA immunization followed by electroporation resulted in fast and high antibody immune responses. After three immunizations antibody levels of more than 100 μg anti-Aβ42 IgG were found in the Balb/c mouse strain, which increased to mean levels of 167.2 ± 59.1 μg/ml plasma following the 6th immunization (Figure 1, 13 mouse groups, n=4–5/group, total number of mice 67).

The anti-Aβ42 isotypes for most conditions used resulted in a mixed immune profile, Th1/Th2, with IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies at similar levels (Figure 2). Also IgG2b and IgM antibodies were analyzed for all conditions used (suppl. Figure 1). Based on previous results from DNA Aβ42 immunizations delivered via gene gun, which resulted in a strong Th2 response with high IgG1/IgG2a ratios, we tried to fine tune the electropulse parameter into a setting which would give similar antibody isotype results (Figure 2).

In the first groups of mice (A1-A3, n = 4 mice/group), parameter settings were used which had been described in the literature (28). In group A1, only two high voltage pulses (1,125 V/cm, 50 μs) were used. In A2, we used 8 low voltage pulses (275 V/cm, 10 ms), and in A3 we combined these two parameters to 2 pulses of 1,125 V/cm with 50 μs duration followed by 8 pulses of 275 V/cm and 10 ms duration (Table 1). The settings in A1 resulted only in a low antibody immune response (32.88 ± 9.06 ug anti-Aβ42 IgG per ml plasma), whereas mice immunized with conditions A2 and A3 reached antibody levels of 167.5 ± 114.1 and 240.3 ± 94.08 ug anti-Aβ42 IgG antibodies per ml plasma, respectively (Table 2, Figure 1). From the IgG isotyping data the immune response in group 1 was classified as mixed immune response with similar levels of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies (Th1/Th2 mixed) (Figure 2, Table 2). Antibody isotyping guided us in the modification of the electropulse parameter settings, as high levels of IgG1 antibodies and low levels of IgG2a antibodies were a goal in this study to generate an immune response similar to DNA immunization via gene gun (20–22).

Based on the data from group 1, the second groups of mice (B1 to B4, n = 5 mice/group) received one high voltage pulse followed by 8 to 16 low voltage pulses (125V/cm, 200V/cm, 275V/cm, and 475V/cm, Table 1). Antibody levels in all four treatment groups were high, reaching mean levels of 221.3 ±85.21μg anti-Aβ42 IgG antibodies per ml plasma (Table 2, Figure 1). The antibody isotype profile was mixed in all four groups. High levels anti-Aβ42 IgG2a antibodies were found for group B2 which had received the highest voltage pulses (475 V/cm, Table 1). Groups B3 and B4 had higher levels of anti-Aβ42 IgG1 antibodies than anti-Aβ42 IgG2a antibodies (Figure 2). Based on these data we continued with the lowest voltage pulses (125V/cm) and modified pulse numbers and pulse durations. In the third group of mice (n = 5 mice/group), groups C1-C4, we used one high voltage pulse followed by 16 to 20 low voltage pulses o 125V/cm with duration times of 5 ms or 10 ms (Table 1). In this group we also used two different types of electrodes: a six-needle and a four-needle array (see methods). Antibody levels were not significantly different between the three treatment groups and reached mean levels of 195.7 ± 52.1 μg anti-Aβ42 IgG antibodies per ml plasma (Figure 1), the antibody isotype profile was mixed (Figure 2). In the last group (D1-D4, n = 5 mice/group), we compared again a high voltage pulse followed by 16 to 20 low voltage pulses of 125V/cm with duration times of 5 ms or 10 ms. In this group the antibody levels were very similar to overall antibody levels in group C with mean antibody levels of 177.8 ± 68.7 μg anti-Aβ42 IgG antibody per ml plasma (Table 2, Figure 1). The isotype pattern of the antibodies was high on IgG1 antibodies in group D3, which had received 20 pulses of 125V/cm with duration times of 5 ms (IgG1/IgG2a ratio of 2.84, Figure 2, Table 2).

3.2. T cell responses

T cell responses were assayed with cytokine ELISPOT assays for IFNγ as Th1 cytokine, IL-17 as Th17 cytokine, both considered as inflammatory immune response, and IL-4 as a typical Th2 cytokine. The four groups of Balb/c mice which had received twelve variant pulse parameter configurations were compared to analyze which setting elicited the least inflammatory immune response. In the first groups of mice, A1 to A3, significant increased numbers of IFNγ and IL-17 secreting splenocytes upon Aβ42 peptide re-stimulation in-vitro were found (Figure 3A). In group 2, B1 to B4, similar numbers of cytokine secreting cells were found after Aβ42 peptide re-stimulation, but because the medium controls in this set of experiments were also higher, the differences were not significant and therefore not antigen specific (data not shown, Table 2). In groups 3 and 4 (C1-C3, D1-D4), in which all the mice had received one high voltage pulse (1,125V/cm, 50 μs) and different variations of the low voltage pulses (16 −20 pulses of 125V/cm, 10 ms or 5 ms), no significant increased cytokine responses were found after Aβ42 peptide re-stimulation, with lowest values in group 3 (C1 - C3, Figure 3B). Higher spot counts (10 – 32 spots) in the not immunized control mice (N) were not due to the peptide re-stimulation as they were higher also in the medium controls, and therefore the increase was not significant. These few positive cell spots might have been due to a non-specific T cell activation in this control mouse cohort. Positive controls (anti-CD3 antibody stimulations) performed in parallel on the same ELISPOT plates showed high spot counts (&gt; 1000 spots, data not shown). Therefore, this setting in groups C and D with 1 pulse of 1,125V/cm, 50 μs followed by 16 −20 pulses of 125V/cm, 10 ms or 5 ms, led to high anti-Aβ42 antibody responses (Figure 1), higher levels of IgG1 antibodies (Figure 2) without anti-Aβ42 inflammatory T cell responses (Table 2, Figure 3). In Figure 3C the cytokine response in the same ELISPOT experiment is shown for one of the mouse groups in group D, D3, in comparison to the parallel analyzed mouse groups which received DNA Aβ42 immunization via gene gun delivery (GG) or Aβ42 peptide immunizations (Pep). DNA immunization with gene gun and electroporation parameter with a low voltage resulted in a non-inflammatory T cell response, while Aβ42 peptide immunization was inflammatory with high levels of IFNγ and IL-17 producing cells upon Aβ42 peptide re-stimulation in-vitro (Figure 3C).

3.3. Treg responses

The mouse strain, Balb/c-Foxp3-EGFP, used in the here shown experiments is transgenic for Foxp3, a transcription factor characteristic for regulatory T cells. T cells which express high levels of Foxp3 can be identified based on their green color. Using flow cytometry, the percentages of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells were directly measured from spleens of the immunized mice (Figure 4A and 4C). The gating on CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells is shown in Figure 4A and 4C. CD4 T cells were stained with an APC conjugated antibody, and gates set around this cell population. Within the CD4+cell populations numbers and percentages of CD25+Foxp3+ were analyzed. The percentages of Tregs (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells) were significantly increased in all of the DNA immunized mice (p values &lt; 0.05, Mann Whitney test), except in mice from group A1 for which a high standard deviation for the percentages of cells was found (4B). To study Treg proliferation, we used an assay we had used before to show that DNA Aβ42 immunization leads to the development of a regulatory T cell response (25). Splenocytes were cultured in medium only, in medium with Aβ1–42 peptide, and in medium with an anti-mouse CD3 antibody as maximal proliferation control. Gates were set similar to the experiments shown in 4A and B. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cell proliferation was found in the wells in which cells were re-stimulated with Aβ1–42 peptide for all three groups which had received DNA Aβ42 immunization via electroporation (Figure 4D). CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cell proliferation upon peptide re-stimulation was not found in mice which had not been immunized (naive controls). The naive mice had significantly less CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ positive cells (p = 0.0392) upon Aβ1–42 peptide re-stimulation.

3.4. Dose-Response Curve

To evaluate how much DNA is needed for optimal humoral immune responses; mice received immunizations with 20, 10, and 4 μg DNA/immunization time point. Based on the high IgG1/IgG1a ratio and low cytokine production in group D3 (Figure 2, Figure 3, Table 2), the parameter used in these experiments was: 1 pulse 1,125 V/cm, 50 μs followed by 20 pulses of 125V/cm, 5 ms (D3, Table 1). Parallel immunized groups of mice received DNA immunizations via gene gun, PBS injections followed by electroporation, and Aβ42 peptide immunization via i.p. injections (n=5 mice/group, 30 mice total). The highest antibody levels due to DNA immunizations were found in mice which had received 20 μg DNA/immunization time point (254.3 ± 53.17 μg/ml) followed by 10 μg DNA/immunization time point (201.8 ± 118.7 μg/ml), and the lowest antibody levels in mice which had received 5 μg DNA/immunization time point (150.3 ± 53.03 μg/ml). Compared to anti-Aβ42 antibody levels found in DNA Aβ42 immunized mice via gene gun (137.5 ±61.19 μg/ml), the high antibody levels in mice receiving 20 ug DNA were significant (p = 0.0197, Figure 5A). The high antibody levels found after Aβ42 peptide immunization were highly significant p &lt; 0.0001 compared to DNA Aβ42 immunization via gene gun delivery. The testing of electroporation for the DNA delivery in a transgenic mouse model (3xTg-AD) resulted in 60.3 ± 4.8 μg/ml anti-Aβ42 antibody in mice receiving 20 ug DNA, 54.4 ± 9.1 μg/ml in mice receiving 10 ug DNA, and 41.2 ± 9.5 μg/ml in mice receiving 5 ug DNA, which is about 5x lower than the antibody found in the wildtype mice and due to the human Aβ42 transgene expression in the AD mouse model. These levels were not significantly different from the antibody levels in the mice which had received DNA immunization via gene gun (47.2 ± 16.8 μg/ml, suppl. Figure 2). Thus, DNA delivery with intradermal injection followed by electroporation can be successfully Applied in the AD transgenic mouse model and is breaking the tolerance against a self-antigen.

In a second group of DNA dose evaluations, we immunized four groups of Balb/c mice (n=5 mice/group, 25 mice total) which received DNA immunizations with 30, 15, 3, and 0.3 μg DNA Aβ42 trimer DNA. Electropulse parameter used in these groups was again the conditions D3 (Table 1). Following the sixth immunization antibody levels were 233.9±150.6 μg/ml, 129 ±42.08 μg/ml, 135.3±46.61 μg/ml, and 55.01±11.89 μg/ml plasma respectively (Figure 5B). These experiments were repeated in groups of B6/C3 F2 mice (n=5 mice/group, 25 mice total). Very high antibody levels were observed in this mouse strain. After three immunizations antibody levels reached 107.1±17.94 μg/ml plasma in the group which had received 30 μg DNA/time point, 103.9±18.83 μg/ml plasma in the group which had received 15 μg DNA/time point, 107.8±15.24 μg/ml plasma in the group which had received 3 μg DNA/time point, and 67.33±26.5 μg/ml plasma in the group which had received 0.3 μg DNA/time point. The anti-Aβ42 antibody levels rose to 2452±1407 μg/ml, 1360±814.3 μg/ml, 1009±562 μg/ml, 391.7± 272.8 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 5C). The overall levels of anti-Aβ42 antibody levels were much higher than in Balb/c mice which is likely due to the MHC haplotypes differences in these mouse strains respectively (35, 36).

3.5. Anti-Aβ42 IgA antibody response in the immunized mice

As a parallel antibody response in the DNA immunized mice, we detected high levels of IgA antibodies. The concentrations of anti-Aβ42 IgA antibodies were as high as the anti-Aβ42 IgG antibody levels in Balb/c (n=8) and B6/129F2 mice (n=15, Figure 6).

3.6. Antibody binding to amyloid plaques in brain tissue from human APP transgenic mice

As a further test to show specificity of the antibodies generated by immune responses to electroporation with the DNA Aβ42 plasmid construct, the binding to amyloid plaques in brains of human APP transgenic mice was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Brain sections from two different AD mouse models (APPswe/PS1, 3xTg-AD) were used and compared to the staining with antisera generated by Aβ42 peptide immunizations and a commercial anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (Figure 7). In Figure 7A and 7C, the staining of amyloid plaques is shown with an antiserum derived from the mice immunized under electroporation protocol A2 (Table 1). A good plaque staining was found for the hippocampus area in a brain section from a 16 months old APPswePS1 double transgenic AD mouse. 7B and 7D show in comparison the staining of parallel sections with a commercial anti-Aβ42 monoclonal antibody, McSA1. The staining pattern observed is very similar having a large number of detected plaques in common. Differences in staining intensity are likely due to differences in the antibody concentrations of the mouse plasma samples used and the monoclonal antibody. In 7E - G brain sections from a 22 months old 3xTg-AD mouse were stained with EP antiserum derived from a mouse which was immunized with DNA Aβ42 and pulse parameters D3. E shows plaque staining in hippocampus, F shows staining in cortex, and G shows no staining in the cerebellum.

For further characterization of the IgA antibody response, mouse brain tissues were stained with plasma from Balb/c mice which had received six immunizations with DNA Aβ42 respectively. Figure 8 shows the staining of plaques in the hippocampus subiculum in a brain of a 24 months old 3xTg-AD mouse using these antisera. The anti-Aβ42 IgG antibodies were detected with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody which was further detected with AF488 (green) labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. Anti-Aβ42 IgA antibodies were detected with a rat anti-mouse IgA antibody visualized with an AF695 (red) labeled goat-anti-rat IgG antibody. IgG and IgA antibodies from the DNA Aβ42 immunized mouse label the plaques in the brain of the 3xTg-AD mouse model and overlap in binding (yellow color, 8A, B, D-F).

4. Discussion:

We have previously used full-length DNA Aβ42 vaccination into the skin via gene gun in wild-type and AD mouse models to develop an effective and safe immunotherapeutic approach for possible clinical use in AD patients to prevent or delay disease progression (20–26, 37, 38). To make this approach more attractive for clinical use, we have here explored the use of electroporation (EP) for vaccination with DNA. A number of clinical trials which used EP for DNA delivery had shown a good safety profile and only limited and temporary side effects at the injection site (27–32). This study in a wild-type mouse model shows that the delivery of the DNA vaccine with a low voltage parameter setting (125V/cm), low duration (5 ms), and high frequency (16–20 pulses) led indeed to high antibody levels with no accompanying cellular immune response (no IFNγ, no IL-17A).

We tested twelve different electropulse parameter settings in this regard: a high anti-Aβ42 antibody response without inducing accompanying inflammatory cellular immune responses. We also used intradermal and not intramuscular DNA injections, as it has been described that intramuscular DNA vaccination resulted in strong cellular immune responses (39, 40). The skin is the largest organ of the human body with a total area of about 20 square feet and easily accessible for immunizations via intradermal injections. Moreover, skin naturally harbors a high number of antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as Langerhans cells and other types of dermal dendritic cells, which can migrate to lymph nodes after DNA/antigen uptake, and present the respective antigen to T cells occurs, thereby increasing immunization efficacy (41,42).

Based on data from the literature, we started with a “common” electropulse protocol using two high voltage pulses to open up the cell membranes in the target area and then lower voltage pulses for DNA delivery into the cells (30). We initially used the antibody isotype profiles in the immunized mice to guide the modifications in the electropulse protocols used in the next set of experiments. We found that high voltage pulses resulted in higher levels of IgG2a antibodies, and higher percentages of IFNγ and IL-17 producing cells in Balb/c mice (Table 2). The lowest voltage pulse possible with the used pulse generator was 125V/cm, and had led to the most favorable results, low levels of IFNγ and IL-17, as well as higher levels of IgG1 antibodies. In variations of pulse duration and frequencies, we also found that short pulse durations (5 ms) were better than long pulse durations (10 ms) in regard to obtaining a Th2 type of immune response, and that a higher rate of pulses (16–20 pulses) increased the antibody response in our sets of experiments.

In regard to the dose responses we found that 30 μg DNA led to the highest antibody responses. A minimal antibody response was found in mice which received 0.3 μg DNA (Figure 5). These data correspond to results published by Dutton et al. 2013, in which HSV virus DNA immunized mice received lethal viral herpes simplex challenge and virus lethality was monitored. Mice receiving 30 μg had the highest immune response whereas mice which received 0.3 μg showed barely any anti-HSV antibody response. However, 70% of the 0.3 μg dose mice survived a 50x LD50 HSV-2 viral challenge, indicating that clinical efficacy can be achieved even when the antibody response is low. In the following Phase I clinical trial in which the authors analyzed safety of the vaccine, patients received doses of 10 μg, 30 μg, 100 μg, 300 μg, and 1 mg. The authors calculated that 0.3 μg DNA in the mouse roughly correspond to a dose of 1 mg in humans, so that this trial was performed with rather low doses assuming that clinical efficacy can be achieved with a low dose vaccination regime (43, 44). On the basis that our study reproduces a similar dose response curve against a self-antigen (Aβ42) compared to a viral antigen, it can be assumed that a low dose regimen might prove effective in a clinical trial with AD patients.

We confirmed that the DNA Aβ42 immunization into the skin led to a regulatory immune response. Splenocytes from the different mouse groups which had received DNA delivery via electroporation had high levels of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells when measured directly from freshly isolated splenocytes (Figure 4), and we could also show that the low levels of proliferating cells following Aβ42 peptide re-stimulation in-vitro were indeed Tregs (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+). Therefore, increased numbers of Tregs following DNA Aβ42 immunization were not changed due to a different form of DNA delivery, and were consistent with our previous reports (22, 25, 26). It is anticipated that a regulatory immune response is beneficial in Aβ42 immunotherapy as it may downregulate inflammatory cellular autoimmune responses as seen in AN1792 (6–8).

Other groups had previously also shown that DNA delivery via electroporation can lead to similar results as DNA vaccination via gene gun (45–47). Depending on the device used, the location of DNA injection, and the pulse parameter settings, DNA delivery via electroporation can target the skin or the muscle (48). In the experiments from others comparing gene gun and electroporation with a DNA Aβ epitope vaccine, DNA was delivered into the muscle and not into the skin, which makes the immunization more prone to a stronger, but induces a potentially inflammatory response (45–50).

It is common knowledge that an IgG1 antibody response in mice is an indicator for a non-inflammatory Th2 immune response, whereas an IgG2a antibody response is indicative for a Th1 response, which can lead to autoimmune inflammation (51–54). This general assumption guided us in the optimization of the electropulse protocol. However, the assumption might not be absolute, as it had been shown in Proteoglycan (aggrecan)-induced arthritis (PGIA) mouse models for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), that the Th1 dominance at the onset of the disease can change (55–57). In a different form of arthritis, the Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), which is also associated with Th1 dominance, high numbers of IL-4-producing cells were detected just before the onset of arthritis (58). Our data showed that mice which had high levels of IgG2a antibodies after six DNA Aβ42 vaccinations via electroporation (Groups A3, B2), had also high levels of IFNγ producing cells indicative of an inflammatory immune response (Th1). In the latter groups, which showed more anti-Aβ42 IgG1 antibodies, less or no IFNγ and/or IL-17 were produced upon antigen specific re-stimulation in cell culture. Therefore, despite the presence of some IgG2a antibodies in the isotype profile, it might be that the non-inflammatory immune response elicited by the DNA immunization into the skin dominates and down regulates the inflammatory responses. We have shown in peptide prime/DNA boost experiments that the DNA boost immunization down regulates inflammatory immune responses despite a mixed IgG1/IgG2a (Th2/Th1) immune profile in these mice (23).

An interesting new finding is the observation, that the DNA immunized mice developed anti-Aβ42 IgA antibody responses with similar titers as the anti-Aβ42 IgG antibody responses (Figure 6). We have found a strong IgA antibody response also in rabbits and Rhesus macaques which had received DNA Aβ42 immunizations with the same plasmid system using the gene gun delivery (59, 60). IgA isotype switching has been reported to follow certain cytokine signals with transforming growth factor (TGFβ) as a major factor and additional contributions from IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 (61). ΤGFβ and IL-10 are produced by regulatory immune cells; IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 are indicators for a Th2 immune response, so that the finding of a strong IgA antibody response is consistent with a Th2/Treg immune response following DNA Aβ42 immunization (22, 25).

In the staining of brain tissue from 3xTg-AD mice, anti-Aβ42 IgG and IgA antibodies from the DNA immunized mice (Figure 8), bound strongly to the amyloid plaques confirming their specificity and supporting the assumption that both antibody isotypes have a role in amyloid removal in brains of immunized AD model mice.

5. Conclusions:

DNA Aβ42 immunization delivered via electroporation into the skin led to high antibody levels with mixed immune responses. With lowering the voltage pulses in the latter groups, we achieved a major shift towards a non-inflammatory T cell response (no IFNγ, no IL-17 producing cells) which was comparable to our previously published findings from DNA Aβ42 immunizations with gene gun delivery (20–26, 35, 36). We are providing here a first attempt to achieve a non-inflammatory response with electroporation, and particularly mice in group D3 showed promise in that regard. Therefore, DNA Aβ42 electroporation is a valuable route to test as possible immunotherapy for Alzheimer’s disease in the clinic.

A) Antibody levels were compared in three groups of Balb/c mice which received different doses of DNA injections (5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg, blue bars) prior to electroporation using the optimized parameter settings (1 pulse, 1,125 V/cm, 50 μs + 20 pulses, 125 V/cm, 5 ms) with mouse groups which received DNA delivery via gene gun (4 μg DNA, striped bar) or mice which received Aβ42 peptide immunizations (100 μg peptide, red bar). All mice had received six immunizations, n=5 mice/group. Plasma was used in a 1:1000 dilution. Antibody levels in the groups which had received electroporation for DNA delivery show relation to the amount of DNA which was injected prior to the electropulse Application (dose-response). Statistics shown are for the antibody levels compared to DNA delivery via gene gun (GG). B, C) Antibody levels in two separate mouse strains which received different doses of DNA injections (30 μg, 15 μg, 3 μg and 0.3 μg) prior to electroporation with parameter settings C3. B) Antibody responses in Balb/c mice: upper graph shows antibody levels after three immunizations, lower graph presents the antibody levels after six immunizations. C) Antibody responses in B6/C3F2 mice: upper shows IgG antibody levels following three DΝΑ Aβ42 immunizations, lower graph shows antibody levels after six immunization time points. Antibody concentrations were measured in plasma diluted 1:200 for the three times time points, and 1:1000 for the six times time points. Note: DNA delivery via gene gun is limited to 4 μg of DNA per mouse due to the limited amount of DNA which can be bound onto the gold particles.
