Retromer deficiency is reported in Down syndrome and correlates with amyloidosis, however, its association with tau neuropathology remains unclear. Down syndrome and control brain tissues were evaluated for phosphorylated tau, tau modulators, and cathepsin-D activity. Several kinases and phosphatase PP2A were unchanged, but tau phosphorylation was elevated, and cathepsin-D activity decreased in aged Down syndrome subjects. Retromer proteins positively associated with soluble tau, whereas pathogenic tau negatively correlated with retromer proteins and cathepsin-D activity. Retromer deficiency and consequent reduction of cathepsin-D activity may contribute to pathogenic tau accumulation, thus, retromer represents a viable therapeutic target against tau pathology in Down syndrome.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Dysfunction of the endosomal-sorting system known as the retromer complex has emerged as a common pathology in various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)1, 2. Mechanistically, retromer system dysfunction can influence amyloid beta production by increasing the interaction of the retromer cargo amyloid precursor protein (APP) with beta-secretase1. However, recent studies have also implicated the retromer complex in the development of tau pathology, both through regulation of tau phosphorylation and degradation via lysosomes3–5. Furthermore, targeting the retromer system has shown promise as an AD therapeutic, since enhancing or restoring retromer function ameliorates the AD-like phenotype in animal models6, 7. We recently reported that similarly to human AD, the levels of retromer recognition core proteins are decreased in subjects with Down syndrome (DS), and that this deficiency inversely correlates with the development of the amyloidotic phenotype associated with AD-DS8. As a follow up to our previous report, in this paper we investigate the association between the retromer complex system and tau pathology in DS. Herein we report that levels of retromer recognition core proteins positively associate with total soluble tau, and negatively with phosphorylated and insoluble tau protein. These associations appear to be independent of kinases and phosphatases, as these proteins are unchanged, but may rely on the availability of protease activity of the retromer cargo cathepsin-D, which we found significantly decreased in DS subjects. These findings indicate that the development of tau pathology coincides with the deficiency of retromer recognition core proteins that occurs during the evolution of the syndrome and support the hypothesis that this deficiency could contribute to the accumulation of pathogenic tau that occurs in DS.

METHODS

Human Brain Samples

Post-mortem cortex and hippocampus tissues from AD, DS, and matched control subjects were obtained from repositories of the NIH Neurobiobank. Post-mortem tissues from DS subjects and matched controls were previously used to examine retromer proteins in DS and detailed subject information was described8. Information for AD and matched control subjects is provided in Supplemental Table 1. The protocol for the study did not require IRB approval since involves the analysis of existing tissue samples without identifiers.

Immunoblot Analysis

Brain homogenates were extracted and subjected to immunoblot analysis as previously described8, 9. The following primary antibodies were used: HT7 (1:200, Invitrogen:MN1000), AT8 (1:200, Invitrogen:MN1020), PHF1 (1:200, gift from P. Davies), PHF13 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technologies:9632), GSK3α/ß (1:200, Cell Signaling Technologies:5676), phospho-GSK3α/ß (1:100, Cell Signaling Technologies:9331), p38 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technologies:8690), phospho-p38 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technologies:4511), CDK5 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technologies:12134), p35 (1:200, Cell Signaling Technologies:2680), cathepsin-D (1:200, Santa Cruz:SC-377124), GAPDH (1:500, Cell Signaling Technologies:2118). GAPDH was used as an internal loading control. An internal control sample was used and samples from each group were included within gels to allow for inter-blot analysis and comparison between groups.

Cathepsin-D activity assay

Cathepsin-D activity was measured via a fluorometric assay following the manufacturer’s instructions (Abcam, ab65302). Fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence microplate reader at Ex/Em=328/460nm, and relative fluorescence normalized by the protein concentration of each sample.

Data analysis and statistical methods

Descriptive summary data were expressed as counts and percentages for categorical variables and mean±SD/SEM and/or median (range) for continuous variables. Continuous variables that are skewed (e.g., tau measurements) were transformed using the log function when the normality assumption is violated on the original scale. Spearman correlation coefficient was employed for correlation analyses between the tau measurements and retromer protein levels. Pairwise group comparisons of retromer proteins and tau measurements between age (&lt;40 vs. ≥40), brain region (cortex vs. hippocampus), and type of subjects (DS vs. controls) subgroups were performed under the framework of the multivariable mixed-effects regression model approach for each variable of interest to take into account the potential correlation between the observations of the two brain regions from the same subjects included in the study. All interaction terms between the age, brain region, and type of subjects were included in the model to account for possible heterogeneous effects across different subgroups. Multiple comparison adjusted p-values and simultaneous 95% confidence intervals for the estimated group differences were derived via the Tukey-Kramer method from the multivariable mixed-effects regression model. P-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Graphpad Prism for Windows version 7.00 were used for all the data analyses.

RESULTS

To assess the relationship between retromer complex system and tau pathology in DS, we examined tau proteins in cortices and hippocampi from young (age 15–30), and aged (age 40–65) subjects with DS and controls (Figure 1). Total tau (HT7) did not differ among groups, and while there were reductions in the pathological conformation of tau detected by MC1 in the hippocampus compared to cortex, MC1 immunoreactivity did not differ significantly between control and DS groups. We also examined phospho-epitopes of tau recognized by the specific antibodies AT8, PHF1, and PHF13. While all comparisons did not reach statistical significance due to high variability, each phospho-epitope was elevated in the cortex and hippocampus of aged DS individuals compared to all other groups, with PHF1 significantly increased in aged DS hippocampus compared to all controls and young DS subjects. Lastly, as a measure of more advanced tau pathology we examined the insoluble fraction of tau protein. Although insoluble tau failed to fit our regression model due to the skewed data distribution, it was dramatically increased in both hippocampi and cortices of aged subjects with DS (Figure 1).

Having confirmed that phosphorylated and insoluble tau were elevated in this DS cohort, we next examined the cortical levels of several tau kinases (CDK5, p25, GSK3α/ß, phospho-GSK3α/ß, p38, and phospho-p38) and the phosphatase PP2A as potential mechanisms of phospho-tau regulation in DS (Figure 2A–J). Protein levels of these kinases and the phosphatase did not significantly differ between groups. To explore potential clearance mechanisms of pathological tau, we next examined the protease cathepsin-D, as it is known to be involved in lysosomal degradation of tau and is regulated via the retromer complex system. Total protein levels of cathepsin-D did not differ among groups; however, cathepsin-D activity was significantly decreased in the cortices of aged DS subjects (Figure 2K–M). To determine whether this finding was specific to AD-DS, we next analyzed cathepsin-D activity levels in cortices of AD subjects and matched controls. No significant differences in cathepsin-D activity were observed between control and AD brain cortices (Supplemental Figure 1).

Using previously published data on retromer proteins in this cohort8, we analyzed the relationship between tau and retromer recognition core proteins (VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29), the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIMPR) retromer cargo receptor, and its cargo cathepsin-D (Table 1). Interestingly, retromer recognition core proteins significantly and positively correlated with total soluble tau but had statistically significant inverse correlations with the levels of two tau phospho-epitopes: PHF1 and PHF13. Furthermore, activity of cathepsin-D, and protein levels of its receptor, CIMPR, showed significant, negative correlations with PHF1, PHF13, and insoluble tau.

DISCUSSION

Despite differences from a clinic-pathological point of view, several neurodegenerative diseases share a common feature which is characterized by the progressive accumulation of unwanted proteinaceous material resulting in altered protein homeostasis10. When internalized cargoes from the plasma membrane first enter the cell they reside in early endosomes, from which they are sorted and trafficked throughout the cell or shipped to the lysosome for degradation. Trafficking of cargoes from endosomes can be mediated by several sorting complexes, such as retromer or retriever, Rab GTPases, and sorting nexins in association with numerous accessory proteins11. Defects in this endocytic pathway were first associated with AD neuropathology when the accumulation of enlarged early endosomes was first described in pyramidal neurons in human post-mortem brain tissue from a cohort of AD patients12. Furthermore, genetic associations studies revealed variants of several endosomal pathway proteins were associated with elevated AD risk13–15, suggesting that endocytic pathway dysfunction could be an upstream event in AD pathogenesis.

The retromer complex is an endosomal system responsible for the sorting of cargoes from endosomes to the cell surface, trans-Golgi, or lysosome for degradation. As such, retromer has emerged as a key player in protein trafficking and homeostasis, and its dysfunction is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases16. We recently reported that protein levels of the retromer recognition core, VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29, are decreased and negatively correlate with the amount of brain amyloidosis in DS subjects8. In the present study, we extend this analysis to include tau pathology in the same cohort. After first confirming that aged subjects with DS accumulate more phosphorylated and insoluble tau than matched controls, in search for a mechanism responsible for it we evaluated known modulators of pathogenic tau. Examination of kinases and phosphatases known to play an active role in these post-translational modifications of tau protein revealed no significant changes among the different groups. However, cortices of aged DS subjects showed decreased activity of the lysosomal protease and retromer cargo protein, cathepsin-D. Interestingly, we did not observe similar decreases in cathepsin-D activity in cortices of AD patients, demonstrating that this finding is unique to AD-DS and not merely secondary to AD pathology, neuronal injury, or cellular stress responses. These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that cathepsin-D activity is unaltered in brains of AD patients17 yet is decreased in cellular models of DS18, revealing a divergence in potential mechanisms underlying AD and AD-DS pathogenesis. Nevertheless, numerous studies have demonstrated the involvement of cathepsin-D in pathological tau clearance, thus, this observation provides a potential mechanistic link between the retromer recognition core deficiency in DS and tau pathology we found in the current study3, 19, 20.

As a continuation of our previous study associating retromer deficiency with Aβ pathology in DS, we applied a regression analysis to our previously reported retromer recognition core proteins data with the current evaluation of tau protein, both soluble and pathological (i.e., phosphorylated isoforms and insoluble fraction), cathepsin-D protein and activity. Total levels of soluble tau (HT7) positively associated with retromer recognition core proteins, whereas the same proteins showed significant negative correlations with specific phospho-epitopes of tau: PHF1 and PHF13. We did not observe negative correlations between retromer core proteins and the tau epitopes recognized by the antibodies MC1 and AT8. Protein levels of soluble MC1 were not elevated in aged DS subjects within this cohort, possibly due to decreased solubility of this conformation of tau. Furthermore, previous analysis of the evolution of tau pathology in DS has demonstrated that AT8 accumulation is an early event in AD-DS that stabilizes during disease progression, whereas PHF1 accumulation continues to increase with advancing neuropathology21. Thus, while we found that AT8 was elevated in aged DS subjects, the degree of AT8 accumulation was diminished compared to the other phospho-epitopes examined, possibly explaining the specificity of our findings. Activity of cathepsin-D, and protein level of its receptor, CIMPR, negatively and significantly associated with phospho-tau epitope PHF1, but showed the strongest inverse correlations with insoluble tau. This observation is consistent with the concept that this protease is involved in the clearing of pathological tau aggregates. It also suggests that individuals with high expression of retromer recognition core proteins retain the physiological, soluble species of tau, whereas retromer depletion promotes the accumulation of the pathogenic forms of tau via the reduction of cathepsin-D activity.

Even in aged individuals, incidence of dementia fails to reach 100% within the DS population despite increased APP gene dosage22, implying that factors outside of HSA21 modulate dementia risk. Based on our findings, we propose that retromer complex insufficiency may allow for the genetic risk conferred by increased HSA21 gene dosage to translate into AD pathogenesis through two distinct mechanisms. First, retromer depletion directly influences the amyloidogenic phenotype found in DS via increased production of Aβ secondary to APP retention in endosomes. Second, efficacy of lysosomal degradation is also significantly impaired due to decreased trafficking and activity of cathepsin-D, resulting in decreased tau clearance and accumulation of phosphorylated tau and insoluble tau aggregates. While our study focuses on classical AD proteinopathies, recent work detailing five distinct molecular subtypes of AD reveals that pathways involved in synaptic integrity may be most influential in determining the clinical features of AD23. We propose that retromer dysfunction fits into this emerging theory of AD pathogenesis. The cluster of downregulated genes within the ATP6V1A subtype includes VPS35, the backbone of the retromer cargo recognition core23. The molecular signature of this subtype suggests that endo-lysosomal system dysfunction may contribute to the accumulation of classical plaques and tangles through lysosomal acidification defects and misrouting of proteases, while also influencing synaptic function via regulation of synaptic proteins and pre-synaptic vesicle release23, 24. We hypothesize that retromer dysfunction in DS may yield similar pathogenetic mechanisms, given the role of the retromer complex in trafficking synaptic proteins and sorting of lysosomal proteases1, 3, but the genetic determinants of AD-DS residing on HSA21 likely cause some deviation from these molecular subtypes.

Because of the established role of the retromer system in these pathways central to AD pathogenesis, it is likely that the altered retromer system expression levels contribute to the enhanced AD-like neuropathology that develops in DS patients. Given that we found low expression of retromer recognition core proteins in the younger subset of patients, we propose that reduced retromer expression bestows high risk for the development of more robust tau and amyloid pathology in DS, and that the retromer represents a novel and viable therapeutic target in the treatment of both neuropathologies in DS.

SUMMARY FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

What is the current knowledge on the topic?

Individuals with Down syndrome have decreased expression of the retromer complex core proteins that inversely correlates with amyloid beta levels. While the retromer system is proposed to also affect pathogenic tau, the impact of retromer deficiency on tau neuropathology in Down syndrome is unknown.

What question did this study address?

Does the retromer complex deficiency contribute to the development of brain tau pathology in Down syndrome subjects?

What does this study add to our knowledge?

We found that the development of tau pathology in Down syndrome inversely correlates with retromer proteins and the proteolytic activity of the cargo protein cathepsin-D. Our data support the concept that the retromer complex is a key regulator of pathogenic tau levels through lysosomal pathway degradation.

How might this potentially impact the practice of neurology?

As the retromer complex can influence both tau and amyloid neuropathology, the retromer complex represents a potential therapeutic target with disease-modifying property for Down syndrome subjects.
