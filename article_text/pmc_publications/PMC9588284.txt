To quantitatively determining the temporal ordering of abnormal age onsets (AAO) among various biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we introduced a computational Monte-Carlo simulation (CMCS) to statistically examine such ordering of an AAO pair or over all AAOs. The CMCS 1) simulates longitudinal data, estimates AAO for each iteration, and finally assesses the type-I error of an AAO pair or all AAO ordering. Using hippocampus volume (VHC), cerebral glucose hypometabolic convergence index (HCI), plasma neurofilament light (NfL), mini-mental state exam (MMSE), the auditory verbal learning test-long term memory (AVLT-LTM), short term memory (AVLT-STM) and clinical-dementia rating sum of box scale (CDR-SOB) from 382 mild cognitive impairment converters and non-converters, the CMCS estimated type-I error for the earlier AAO of VHC, AVLT_STM and AVLT_LTM each than MMSE was significant (p&lt;0.002). The type-I error for the overall AAO temporal ordering of VHC ≤ AVLT_STM ≤ AVLT_LTM &lt; HCI ≤ MMSE ≤ CDR-SOB ≤ NfL was p = 0.012. These findings showed that our CMCS is capable of providing statistical inferences for quantifying AAO ordering which has important implications in advancing our understanding of AD.

pmc1 Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease, is a progressive disorder characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) as the commonly recognized pathological hallmarks, among others. The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association workgroups (NIA-AA) proposed new research criteria for the diagnosis of AD. The new criteria included the integration of biomarkers to stage different AD phases that were based on the idea that AD dementia follows a continuous course from presymptomatic (preclinical) AD, to symptomatic pre-dementia (mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD) and finally to AD dementia [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. For convenience in this report, we also use the word ‘biomarker’ for cognitive measures and clinical ratings. Consistent with the new criteria for AD diagnosis, the hypothetical evolution model of AD biomarkers has been proposed [6] and updated [7]. The theoretical modeling by Jack and colleagues assumes that different biomarkers are temporally ordered with a sigmoid-shaped trajectory for each biomarker over time [6]. For example, the Aβ and other neurodegenerative biomarker abnormalities occur decades before the clinical diagnosis of dementia due to AD [6] [7]. It is therefore crucial to adequately quantify the order and timing of different biomarkers for the evaluation of effective disease-modifying therapies, including prevention strategies in clinical trials.

Biomarkers depict the pathological, physiological, clinical and behavioral changes during different phases of AD, and they have gained considerable attention in AD-related research [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The well-established biomarkers associated with AD involved in brain imaging, biochemical and cognitive measurements include Aβ deposition [15], [16] and tau accumulation [17], [18] assessed by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging; gray matter volumes based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [10], [19], [20]; cerebral metabolic rates for glucose measured by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging [21]; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A β42 and CSF tau [22], [23], [24]; plasma NfL [25],[26] and cognitive tests/clinical assessments such as the MMSE and the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) [27]. The sequential changes in these biomarkers provide abundant information on the pathophysiology of AD and elucidate the progression of AD from the preclinical to clinical stages. Thus, the modeling of AD biomarker progression could be the key to enable interventions at the earliest possible phase of the disease.

Over the disease course or the aging process, biomarkers have been shown to follow different temporal evolution trajectories but in a sequential manner[6], [7]. Supporting this modeling are multiple longitudinal or cross-sectional studies [28], [29],[30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. For early onset familial AD, Bateman et al. and Fleisher et al. each reported a similar temporal ordering of biomarkers so that CSF Aβ42 and amyloid PET abnormalities were detected first, followed by a CSF tau increase, hypometabolism and gray matter atrophy, and finally the clinical symptoms [28], [29]. Bateman and colleagues found that CSF Aβ42 started to decline 25 years prior to expected symptom onset in dominantly inherited AD. They also found that Aβ deposition, increased concentrations of tau protein and brain atrophy were detected at 15 years prior, hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory were detected at 10 years prior, and global cognitive impairment 5 years prior [28]. Fleisher and colleagues investigated age-associated changes in brain imaging and fluid biomarkers in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A (Glu280Ala) mutation carriers and noncarriers, and they found biomarkers changed sequentially. Specifically, CSF Aβ1–42 was detected at age 20 years, Aβ deposition at 16 years, changes in the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose at 15 years, CSF total tau at 15 years, hippocampal volume at 6 years, and cognitive decline up to 6 years before the kindred’s estimated median age of 44 years at MCI diagnosis [29]. Gordon et al. also found a similar biomarker sequence to pathological changes with Aβ deposition first, followed by hypometabolism and lastly structural decline before expected onset in mutation carriers compared with non-carriers [30]. The findings for sporadic AD have also been reported [16], [35], [36]. Insel and colleagues estimated the associations among Aβ pathology, brain structure, metabolism and cognition, and they observed that the acceleration of hypometabolism development and subtle signs of cognitive dysfunction occurred 20+ and 10+ years before Aβ biomarkers reach conventional thresholds for Aβ-positivity, respectively [16]. We note that the statistical assessments of temporal ordering reported in these studies were missing or post-hoc in nature.

In order to determine the temporal ordering of biomarkers in constructing a time-dependent model of a disease, the time (or age) at which the abnormality occurrence, referred to as AAO, for each biomarker needs to be first identified. Bateman et al. applied a linear mixed model to each biomarker to determine the earliest age (i.e., AAO), prior to the expected AD symptom onset, at which the difference between mutation carriers and noncarriers becomes statistically significant based on the approximate Student’s t-test [28]. In addition to the use of the approximate Student’s t-test for biomarkers, Fleisher et al. applied curvilinear regression models to fit the florbetapir based amyloid biomarker and identified the age at which the amyloid starts to accumulate (derivative of the curve becomes non-zero) as the AAO in PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers [29]. In the same study and under the linear mixed effect modeling, the AAO was defined as the age at which the two 95% confidence bands of the fitted two linear mixed effects (LME) curves, one for the group of interest and the other for the control group, start to completely separate [29], [37].

The proper trajectory modeling and the AAO identification for each biomarker has been the focus of the existing studies, but the temporal ordering of these trajectories has been more or less post-hoc in nature. These publications did not address specifically the type-I error assessment for biomarker AAO temporal ordering nor providing any statistical method to do so. Then the rigorous statistical procedure is required to rank them to compare the timing of biomarker abnormalities.

In sum, there are two related issues to determine the biomarker temporal ordering: 1) the identification of the AAO, the age at which the abnormal appearance first occurred for each biomarker; 2) the statistical examination of the temporal ordering of the AD biomarkers. Because issue 1 has been well addressed, our focus in this study will be exclusively on issue 2 by introducing the CMCS method. Two types of statistical inferences can be performed basd on our CMCS procedure. The first is the type-I error assessment for AAO pairwise comparison to examine if one biomarker’s AAO being earlier, or x-years earlier, than the AAO of another biomarker. The second is of omnibus, global over the entire sequence of any number of biomarkers’ AAO. We note that we used LME modeling for illustrative purposes, our approach worked whether the temporal trajectory model was linear or nonlinear. We also note that the CMCS procedure are applicable to each of three AAO identification approaches.

2 Methods

2.1 Linear mixed effects modeling

To illustrate the general concept of the CMCS approach, we assumed that the longitudinal biomarker data followed the LME modeling. The LME models can appropriately handle the variance-covariance structure in longitudinal measurements even in some cases of missing data points or unequal time intervals across different visits and among subjects. The LME models included two sets of regression parameters to account for the group-level fixed effects and subject-specific random effects [38], [39].

We used the LME model in the context of two groups of patients. Patient group 1 included N1 MCI subjects who progressed to AD (MCI converters: MCI-c group) and group 2 included N2 MCI subjects who did not (MCI non-converters: MCI-nc group). The longitudinal changes for subjects in each of these two groups followed the group specific linear trajectories characterized by the LME models. For the measurement of a given biomarker, the response variable y at the kth visit or observation for subject j in group i, is given by: (1) yijk=β0i+β1iArijk+(b0ij+b1ijArijk)+εijk

where β0i and β1i are the fixed intercept and slope for group i, respectively; b0ij and b1ij are the random intercept and slope for subject j in group i, respectively; Ar is the relative age (years before conversion time), for the MCI-c subject, the relative age was calculated as the difference between the age at the time of scanning and the age of conversion to AD at the end of the follow-up period, and for the MCI-nc subject, the relative age was calculated as the difference between the scanning time and average conversion time of the MCI-c subjects; and εijk s the residual error (ε~N(0, σ2residual)). Both b0ij and b1ij follow normal distributions: b=[b0b1]; b~N(0,Σ); Σ=[σ2b0σb0b1σb0b1σ2b1];

Where N (0, Σ) represents the zero mean bivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix Σ

2.2 Abnormal age onset (AAO) definition

The longitudinal changes in the MCI-c and MCI-nc groups followed the group-specific trajectory characterized by the LME models. We defined the AAO as the age at which the MCI-c trajectory diverged from the MCI-nc. It is the start of the complete separation of the 95% confident bands for the MCI-c and MCI-nc. Fig. 2 in the Results illustrated our AAO identification approach.

2.3 Computational Monte Carlo simulation (CMCS) procedure

We developed a CMCS procedure to characterize and compare the AAO difference among different biomarkers. We first illustrated the use of our CMCS method with two biomarkers. The procedure statistically tested the hypothesis that the AAO of biomarker 1 was earlier, or x-years earlier, than that of biomarker 2 (The null hypothesis is that the two biomarkers’ AAO are the same). Second, we also made our simulation capable of assessing the AAO temporal ordering of any number of biomarkers. This omnibus test (global for the whole sequence) is in addition to the pairwise biomarker comparison. The details of omnibus test are described in later this Methods section.

In general, and like the conventional statistical tests, the CMCS procedure started with the estimation of parameters in the LME model. The parameters are the fixed effect parameters β0, β1, random effect variables b0, b1 with mean 0 and the estimated covariance matrix Σ, and the estimated variance of the residual error ε. Using these as the setting for the Monte Carlo simulations, the CMCS followed a series of steps, detailed below (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 illustrates the CMCS use for pairwise comparison. Conceputally and in practice, the same procedure is used simultaneously for the order of the entire sequence.

For each of the N iterations and for each of the biomarkers: Simulate the data for each of the two groups (MCI-c and MCI-nc) using the LME model parameters specific to the respective group.

Fit the LME model to the simulated data for each biomarker and each group.

Estimate the AAO of each biomarker.

For the pairwise AAO comparison, calculate the AAO difference between two biomarkers as D = AAO2 – AAO1, assuming biomarker 1 had an earlier AAO (i.e., AAO1 &lt; AAO2). For the whole AAO sequence assessment of all biomarkers, record the simulated order and compare it to the hypothesized sequence.

For the AAO sequence ordering (to test the consistence with the hypothesized order of the sequences), we propose two consistency criteria. For the first, we directly compare the ordering under the most restrictive sense. We will use the observed biomarker order in this study to illustrate. From the observed order VHC ≤ AVLT_STM ≤ AVLT_LTM &lt; HCI ≤ MMSE ≤ CDR-SOB ≤ plasam NfL (see the Results section) and AAO pairwise comparison, we used “≤” in almost every neighboring pairs except the AVLT_LTM and HCI pair. We defined the equal part “=” in “≤” as, for HCI and MMSE pair as an example, that the opposite direction HCI &gt; MMSE, but not d greater than MMSE, where d is the distance estimate based on the original real data. The switch is only allowed for its immediate neighbor in the original sequence.

Our second approach is to compute the simple correlation coefficient between our hypothesized sequence (based on the real data) and the sequence generated at each iteration of the simulation. Note a perfect correlation of 1.0 or close to it implies the exact ordering is preserved in the simulation. Based on our examination on the possible switching between neighboring biomarkers, we used 0.8 as the cut-off value for correlation coefficients as the ‘definition’ of the biomarker ordering consistence.

Repeat the above simulation N times. For each iteration, the same number of MCI participants and the same number of visits were simulated as in the original data set.

For the pairwise AAO comparison, count the number of times, n, that the difference values D does not exceed x; For the AAO sequence ordering comparison, count the number of times, n, that the AAO sequence is not consistent with the hypothesized sequence. Then compute the likelihood as the ratio n/N.

If the probability is less than 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.

3 Experiments

3.1 Subjects and data

All 382 MCI participants were from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of the ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adniinfo.org. The ADNI study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions, and informed written consent was obtained by all participants.

Out of the total of 382 MCI participants who had at least two visits and an MCI diagnosis at the baseline visit, there were 129 subjects who progressed to probable AD and were labeled as the MCI-c within the average 2.23-year follow-up. The remaining 253 subjects who maintained a diagnosis of MCI were labeled as the MCI-nc within the average 2.32-year follow-up. Note the two followup times are statistically not different between MCI-c and MCI-nc (p = 0.51). Table 1 shows the demographic information of all subjects. The imbalanced sex ratios between converters and non-converters were not by design. Rather, it was a reflection of the sex ratio among ADNI MCI participants we included in this study. We noted that the sex ratios in converters and in non-converters were not statistically significant (p = 0.69). This ensured us the age trajectory differences were not biased due to the variation of sex ratios from one group to another.

The structural MRI data of all subjects were collected at multiple sites based on the ADNI MRI scanning protocols (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mri-protocols/). All downloaded structural MRI data have undergone gradwarping, intensity correction and were scaled for gradient drift. The hippocampus volume (VHC) was measured with the FreeSurfer software package 5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The specific procedures are detailed by Fischl et al. [40], [41]. We calculated the relative hippocampal volume divided by intracranial cavity volume (ICV) as a biomarker to avoid the confound of individual variability in head size [42].

Additional biomarkers we examined in this study included plasma NfL, CSF total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and Aβ42, FDG-PET based HCI, AVLT-STM, AVLT-LTM and CDR-SOB. HCI was introduced to characterize in a single measurement the extent to which the magnitude and spatial extent of cerebral hypometabolism in a person’s FDG-PET image corresponded to that in a group of patients with AD [43]. We demonstrated the ability of the HCI to distinguish among the clinically diagnosed probable AD, MCI and normal control (NC) groups, its correlations with clinical severity, and its ability to predict subsequent clinical progression from MCI to the probable AD dementia [43].

3.2 Using the CMCS to examine the AAO differences

Using MMSE as reference, we first did the pairwise type-I error comparison, we evaluated the type-I error of a given pair of biomarkers: a given biomarker AAO is x-year earlier than MMSE AAO where x = 0, 1, and 2. The type-I error was computed based on the percentage of times, over 500 iterations of the CMCS procedure, that the AAO of the given biomarker preceded the AAO of the MMSE by a given number of years. Additionially, the statistical type-I error of a given temporal sequence of AAO ordering for more than two biomarkers was also estimated using the two approaches we introduced earlier.

3.3 CMCS robustness

We also examined the robustness of the CMCS performance but only focused on pairwise AAO difference using the comparison between: VHC and MMSE. We repeated the same CMCS procedure but increased the variances of the random effects and the residual error by up to 300%.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Estimated abnormal age onsets (AAO)

The MCI-c group diverged from the MCI-nc group at age year 6.72 (AAO = −6.72) for VHC, 6.12 for AVLT_STM, 5.45 for AVLT_LTM, 3.87 for HCI, 3.20 for MMSE, 2.89 for CDR-SOB, and 1.56 for Plasma NfL, respectively, before the AD diagnosis (Fig. 2 and Table 2).

For CSF t-tau, p-tau and Aβ each, the two trajectories for converters and for non-converters did not separate over the examined age range for this MCI population. So AAO could not be defined for these CSF biomarkers and their AAO temporal ordering could not be assessed.

4.2 Examining the AAO differences

Table 2 lists the detailed statistical results of the CMCS procedure with 500 iterations. Using MMSE as reference, the pair-wise type-I error comparison showed that the AAO of V HC, AVLT_STM and AVLT_LTM was significantly earlier than that of the MMSE, respectively, with the type-I error p &lt; 0.002 (0 times out of 500 iterations). We also tested if the AAO of the VHC was at least 1, 2 or 3 years earlier than the AAO of the MMSE using the CMCS. We found that the corresponding p-values were p &lt; 0.002, = 0.044 and = 0.276 (0, 22 and 138 times out of 500 iterations). Thus, at p = 0.05, though we rejected the hypothesis that the AAO of VHC was at least 3 years earlier than the AAO of MMSE, we could not for 2 years earlier. Similarily, we rejected the hypothesis that the AAO of the AVLT_STM and AVLT_LTM was at least 2 years earlier than the AAO of MMSE, we could not for 1 year earlier (Table 2).

For the statistical type-I error estimation of a given temporal sequence of AAO ordering for the seven biomarkers, we observed: VHC ≤ AVLT_STM ≤ AVLT_LTM &lt; HCI ≤ MMSE ≤ CDR-SOB ≤ plasam NfL. We note this is a strong statement global for all of the listed biomarkers. For the first approach, our Monte-Carlo simulation estimated p = 0.128 type-I error so we can reject this hypothesized ordering sequence. For the second approach, based on our examination on the possible switching between neighboring biomarkers, we used 0.8 as the cut-off value for correlation coefficients as the ‘definition’ of the biomarker ordering preservation. And our simulation results showed that we cannot reject such ordering with p = 0.012.

4.3 The robustness of the CMCS to noise magnitude

We artificially increased the variance of the random effects, from 110% to 300%, while keeping all other parameters in the LME model unchanged. At the 160% noise level, the AAO of the VHC was significantly at least 1 year earlier than the AAO of MMSE (p = 0.048). At the 210% noise level, we found the AAO of the VHC preceded the AAO of the MMSE (p = 0.046). At the 150% noise level for both the increased variance of the random effects and the residual error, we still observed the AAO of the VHC was significantly at least 1 year earlier than the AAO of the MMSE (p = 0.044). At the 190% level, the AAO of the VHC AAO also preceded the AAO of the MMSE (p = 0.016).

5 DISCUSSION

Based on LME modeling and longitudinal measurements from the ADNI data, we introduced a CMCS procedure to statistically assess the ordering difference of the abnormality occurrence between AD-related biomarkers. Our study is our attempt to develop a method addressing the temporal ordering of the AD biomarkers, especially with regard to the provision of a means to compute the type-I error (p-values) for statistical inference. We first statistically test the AAO difference of a pairwise biomarker and further to test a given AAO temporal sequence of any number of biomarkers. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of the CMCS to noise magnitude by artificially enlarging the variances of random effects and/or the residual error. This is basically a methodology development for LME modeling. We believe it is applicability to other models such as survival analysis which takes the data censoring into the consideration.

The longitudinal changes of AD-related biomarkers for subjects in the MCI-c and MCI-nc groups were assumed to follow the group specific LME models. The MMSE is one typical cognitive behavior test for general cognition. Thus, we chose the MMSE biomarker as reference for the pairwise type-I error comparison. We observed that the AAO of three biomarkers (VHC, AVLT_STM and AVLT_LTM) was significantly earlier than that of the MMSE. Especially, the AAO of VHC was at least 2 years earlier than the AAO of MMSE at the significance level of 0.05. The structural MRI studies have consistently found that hippocampus volume could be a potential biomarker to indicate the AD disease stage [44], [45], [46]. Our results suggest that volumetric MRI-based hippocampus volume, were more sensitive and the earliest predictor of disease progression for this MCI population we examined. The AAO of both AVLT_STM and AVLT_LTM preceds that of MMSE which is similar to the findings in Bateman et al. (2012) [28] and Jedynak et al. (2012) [31]. Dubois et al. suggests that early episodic memory impairment should be considered into core diagnostic criterion for AD [2].

In addition to the AAO pairwise comparisons, we also introduced a procedure for evaluating the ordering of a sequence consisting multiple biomarkers, seven in this study. For the statistical type-I error estimation of a given temporal sequence of AAO ordering observed based on the data used in this study for the seven biomarkers shown in Table 2: VHC ≤ AVLT_STM ≤ AVLT_LTM &lt; HCI ≤ MMSE ≤ CDR-SOB ≤ plasam NfL. Our CMCS procedure provided two different results. For the first ordering definition (approach a) which define the order more rigorously, the observed order cannot be accepted at p = 0.05. On the other hand, our CMCS showed that we can accept this ordering sequence using more lenient approach b, the degree of consistence based on correlation coefficient. The two seemingly opposite results are actually understandable in that the order can be accepted at the macroscopic but not at the microscopic level.

For this methodology focused report, we did not conside the use of amyloid PET data. Our results showed that MRI based hippocampus volume was the earliest while the 3 CSF based Aβ or tau biomarkers failed to characterize the difference between the MCI-c and MCI-nc. It is worth noting that the temporal ordering sequence and the absence of the CSF based biomarkers in this sequence are consistent with a recent report [47] for this population we studied in this report, i.e., the MCI-c vs MCI-nc. In the report by Mattsson et al., it was observed that, among cognitively impaired individuals, the MRI based neurodegenerative biomarker is more robust than CSF based biomarkers. The hypothetical modeling of biomarkers proposed by Jack Jr. and colleagues supports the general temporal ordering in whichh amyloid biomarkers become abnormal first, followed by hypometabolism and structural gray matter atrophy, and then the onset of clinical symptoms [6] [7]. For the MCI-c in contrast to the MCI-nc, the VHC and HCI biomarker became abnormal significantly earlier than the global cognitive scores such as MMSE and CDR-SOB, in agreement with the theoretical biomarker modeling by Jack Jr. et al. [6] [7] and the findings of other studies [31], [32], [33]. Jedynak et al. found that the Rey AVLT delayed recall was the earliest biomarker to become abnormal among other biomarkers comprising with VHC and the concentrations of Aβ and tau and cognitive biomarkers [31]. Similar to our biomarker ordering, such findings suggest that episodic memory impairment was an earlier predictor of disease progression. There is lacking studies on plasam NfL AAO ordering. Mattsson et al. investigated the relationship between plasma NfL and hallmarks of AD and found that longitudinal plasma NfL increased in significant association with baseline CSF biomarkers (low Aβ42, high t-tau, and high p-tau), small hippocampal volumes and thin regional cortices, and large ventricular volumes, hypometabolism, and poor cognitive performance [47]. Quiroz et al. found that plasma NfL levels increased with age in both PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and non-carriers and began to differentiate carriers from non-carriers at an average age of 22 years (22 years before the estimated median age at clinical MCI onset of 44 years) [26]. These two studies advocate that plasma NfL can be used as a potential biomarker to detect and track the disease progression of AD. The order of plasma NfL relative to other AD biomarkers needs to be further investigated in the future.

Additionally, we assessed the robustness of the CMCS to noise magnitude using the pairwise AAO difference comparison of VHC and MMSE biomarkers as an example. The purpose of such investigation is to see how the CMCS performs even if parameter variability in the LME modeling was under-estimated or the noise level in a future dataset is higher than what observed in the testing dataset we used. We first increased only the variance of the random effects. We started at 110% and increased the variance to as high as 300% of the original standard deviation (with an increase of 10%). The CMCS still output that the VHC AAO was significantly earlier than the MMSE AAO, with the type-I error p &lt; 0.05, when the variance was increased to as high as 210% of the original value. We also increased both the variance of the random effects and the residual error from 110% to 300%. The same significance was observed when both were increased to as high as 190% of the original values. These results suggest that the CMCS is robust, to some extent, to different/higher levels of noise.

Even though the current study used a linear case to demonstrate the CMCS algorithm, the procedure will also work when the models for one group or both groups are not linear. We note that the CMCS works on the AAO values obtained over all simulations, independent of whether each AAO value was generated based on a linear model or a non-linear model. Thus, the general concept of the CMCS approach applies to either linear or nonlinear models (e.g., survival analysis). Moreover, this procedure also can be generalized to markers of other diseases and to non-medical fields wanting to solve the same statistical issue of temporal sequencing examination.

At the first appearance, this procedure is self-referring in the sense that our procedure used the entire dataset to estimate model parameters which were used to simulate the observations based on which to compute the test statistic. We argue that our procedure follows the same logic of the traditional student’s t-test. Using simple t-test as an example, it estimates the parameters, mean and standard deviation, using the entire dataset, and then the test statistic is algebraically computed. The statistical inference is again back to the original dataset. Logic-wise, our procedure is the same except the test-statistic was not computed algebraically, but via CMCS. Overall, the entire dataset is a sample from a bigger population and the statistical reference is related to the population.

We note that the CMCS procedure is the way we proposed in this study to explicitly consider the temporal ranking issue. In a previous comprehensive study [32], Ox-toby and colleagues introduced the elegant event-based model (EBM) for cross-sectional data. EBM has the potential to be used for longitudinal data which will require additional efforts as a separate future study. For longitudinal data, the same report used differential equation model (DEM). Using DEM, they were able to estimate abnormality transition time for each biomarker, not the AAO differences among multiple biomarkers. Also note the estimated time to onset (ETO) in their study is an average over multiple biomarkers, not their differences. Other methods such as bootstrapping or permutation test can be considered as well. In reporting their results in [48], bootstrapping resampling was used to estimate the standard deviation of the ages at which the structural MRI based regional brain atrophy rates changed (referred to changepoint). This standard deviation can be used subsequently for assessing AAO ordering. Note this bootstrapping is in addition to the permuation test which was used to correct for multiple comparisons over different brain regions. Another study [49], claiming that bootstrapping resampling does not provide information regarding the significance of their temporal ordering, used permuation test to compare the ordering of a given pair biomarkers, yet to address the sequence ordering for all biomarkers.

It is at least conceptually possible that the statistical test we proposed in this study can be performed analytically in the context of LME model instead of the Monte-Carlo simulation. However, theoretical challenges to establish such parametric test are not trivial. At first, we need to express the AAO analytically with possible derived probability distributions (most likely not student t-distribution). This distribution will also definitely dependent on the way the AAO is defined. In our case, it is the time/age at which the 95% CI bands started to separate for the given two biomarker trajectories. The existence of such analytical expression is yet to be mathematically derived, it being linear or not. Secondly, we also need to consider the AAO x-year difference between the two given biomarkers. Determination of the probability distribution for such difference is less challenging, but also need some theoretical derivations for different values of x. Given all of these challenges for such analytic procedure establishment, if achievable, our proposed approach is a practical and adequate intermediate solution.

There are several limitations to this study. First, we applied the LME modeling to the longitudinal biomarker data to illustrate the CMCS approach. The general concept of this procedure can be used for nonlinear models as mentioned above, but we have not yet investigated nonlinear models. Second, the use of the 95% confidence band as the approach for identifying AAO. In the future, we plan to test the CMCS procedure using two other alternative methods of determining the AAO (e.g., an approximate t-test and a significant different curve slope inflection). Third, we evaluated the robustness of our CMCS procedure by changing the noise in two ways: increasing the variance of only the random effects and increasing the variance of both random effects and the residual error based on the same noise level. Future studies will perform a comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of the CMCS procedure by simultaneously increasing the different noise magnitudes of random effects and the residual error. Such investigation will be informative for our proposed approach to deal with noises in the data and so the degree of noise impact on biomarker performance can be assessed quantitatively. Based on these findings, we will be able to consider measures to minimize the effects of noises. Finally, the methodology development aimed to statistically examine the temporal ordering of AD biomarker AAO is at its infancy. Our effort should be regarded as preliminary and with room to further improve. Additionally, it needs to be compared with other methods as part of our future continued investigations.

6 Conclusion

A crucial element of biomarker-based staging of AD is to establish the order of different biomarkers. We proposed the CMCS model to compare and characterize the temporal sequence among different AD biomarkers. Our methodological innovation is the rigorous statistical examination of one biomarker’s AAO being earlier, or x-years earlier, than another biomarker’s AAO in the pairwise comparision, and further the statistical assessment of the AAO temporal ordering of any number of biomarkers. This quantitative assessment of the timing order of biomarkers could help adequately depict how biomarker abnormalities evolve during disease progression and further advance the understanding of AD pathophysiology. The assessment of temporal order could also help identify distinct stages of the progression to AD dementia for the design of feasible disease-modifying therapies before the onset of clinical symptoms at the earliest possible disease stage with the proper biomarker.
