Abstract/Summary:

There is a growing interest in expanding the multiplexing capability of immunohistochemistry to achieve a deeper phenotyping of various cell types in health and disease. Here we describe a protocol of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry that enables the labeling of up to 16 antigens on the same formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded section using “off-the-shelf,” commercially available, primary antibodies as well as fluorescently-conjugated secondary antibodies. Key steps include the denaturing/stripping of the antibodies by microwaving and the quenching of any remaining fluorescent signal between the cycles of otherwise traditional multiplexed fluorescent immunohistochemistry. We have successfully applied this protocol to characterize astrocytic and microglial responses to Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease brains, but it could be easily adapted to other user’s needs regarding cell types, disease, and organ.

pmc1. Introduction

Fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been traditionally used to study the simultaneous localization of a limited number—three or four—of protein markers on a tissue section. However, there is growing interest in expanding the multiplexing capability of fluorescent IHC to capture the heterogeneity of cellular changes associated with normal aging, injury, or disease while preserving their spatial context [1–5]. Single-nuclei and single-cell RNA sequencing are revealing the wide diversity of brain cell subpopulations and states under normal and pathological conditions [6–10], but are limited by the lack of spatial information. Spatial transcriptomic and proteomic methods are rapidly improving and reaching single-cell resolution [11–14], but also require expensive, highly specialized equipment, which is not accessible to many laboratories.

Here we report a novel cyclic multiplex fluorescent IHC protocol that allows the labeling and quantitation of up to 16 different markers in the same formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human postmortem brain section with “off-the-shelf,” commercially available, primary and fluorescently-conjugated secondary antibodies. We have successfully applied this methodology to identify various phenotypes of astrocytes and microglia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and healthy control brains and examine the effect of the distance between these cells and the AD neuropathological hallmarks—amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles [15]—but this method could be easily adapted by the user to characterize other cell types, diseases, and tissues.

To develop this protocol, we combined the Opal [16] and the tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) [17–20] methods. Briefly, the protocol first involves a traditional fluorescent IHC with primary and species-appropriate fluorescently-labeled secondary antibodies. After imaging the whole section, the antibodies are denatured by microwave heating (as described in the Opal method) [16] and any fluorescent signal from remaining secondary antibodies is quenched with an oxidizing alkaline solution (as in the t-CyCIF method) [17–20]. Next, a new round of traditional fluorescent IHC and imaging follows, and this cycle is repeated up to 8 times (Fig. 1). The protocol is versatile so that the user can design a different sequence of primary antibodies and add more markers and cycles. Finally, we have also developed an image analysis pipeline to segment glial cell profiles and quantify the signal intensity of all markers at the single-cell level.

In summary, this protocol is a useful methodology to comprehensively phenotype individual cell profiles while preserving the tissue architecture and the spatial relationships between the cell type(s) of interest and the disease neuropathological features.

2. Materials

Unless otherwise indicated, prepare and store all reagents at room temperature (RT). Follow waste disposal regulations when disposing waste materials.

FFPE tissue sections: postmortem human temporal lobe specimens are fixed by immersion in 10% formalin for 2-3 weeks and, after fixation, a small 2×2 cm block is dissected and embedded in paraffin (see Note 1). Eight-μm-thick tissue sections are cut with a microtome and mounted on microscope glass slides. Postmortem human brain tissue samples should always be obtained following informed written consent by the next-of-kin and under an approved Institutional Review Board protocol.

Primary antibodies: see Table 1 for a list of primary antibodies tested and their working conditions (see Note 2). Fluorescently-labeled primary antibodies, either commercially available or home made using a labeling kit, can also be used in this protocol; in that case, just skip steps #11 and #12 in the Methods section 3.1.

Secondary antibodies: use your regular secondary antibodies. This protocol was developed with Cyanine3 (Cy3)-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, AlexaFluor488 (AF488)-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit, and Cyanine5 (Cy5)-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA), all of them made in donkey and used at a 1:200 concentration (see Note 3).

Xylenes (see Note 4).

Ethanol: prepare 100%, 95%, 80%, and 70% ethanol solutions in distilled water (see Note 5).

Citrate buffer: citric acid anhydrous 10 mM, 0.05% Tween20, pH 6.0. Dissolve 1.92 g of citric acid anhydrous in 900 mL of distilled water. Adjust pH to 6.0 with 2N sodium hydroxide and add 0.5 mL of Tween20. Add distilled water up to 1 L. Store at RT for 3 months or at 4°C for 1 year.

Tris-buffered saline (TBS): tris base 50 mM, sodium chloride 150 mM, pH 7.4. Weigh 6.05 g Tris base and 8.76 g sodium chloride. Dissolve them in 1 L of distilled water and adjust pH to 7.4 with 2N hydrochloric acid.

Blocking buffer: 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) in TBS. Prepare fresh before use.

Antibody buffer: 5% NDS in TBS. Prepare fresh before use.

Sudan Black B solution or alike (e.g., Millipore Autofluorescence Eliminator Reagent): 1% Sudan Black B in ethanol 70%. For 1 L, dissolve 10 g in 1 L of 70% ethanol. Filter through a 0.22 μm syringe filter before applying it onto the sections to remove any precipitated crystals.

DAPI solution: DAPI 0.001 mg/mL in TBS. Add 20 μL of DAPI 5 mg/mL to 9.980 mL of TBS to prepare a 0.01 mg/mL stock. From this stock, make a 1:10 dilution to obtain the 0.001 mg/mL working solution. Store at RT protected from light for 6 months.

Aqueous mounting medium with DAPI (e.g., DAPI Fluoromount-G® SouthernBiotech).

Coverslip removal solution: Tween20 0.05% in TBS. Dilute 500 μL of Tween20 in 1 L of TBS (see Note 6). Store at RT.

NaHCO3 stock solution: 0.5M NaHCO3, pH 11.2. Dissolve 42 g of NaHCO3 in 1 L of distilled water. Mix thoroughly and add 2N sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH around 11.2. Store at 4°C for up to 6 months. Check the pH prior to use to confirm that it remains between 10.9 and 11.3. If the pH is outside this range, discard the buffer and prepare fresh.

30% H2O2 stock solution.

Fluorescence quenching solution: 0.1M NaHCO3, 3% H2O2, pH 11.2. For a final volume of 100 mL, mix 20 mL of NaHCO3 stock solution with 70 mL of distilled water. Immediately before use, add 10 mL of 30% H2O2 and mix properly. Do not reuse this solution.

17.2. Coplin jars.

17.3. Slide staining moisture chamber (see Note 7).

17.4. Hydrophobic barrier pen (PAP pen or similar).

17.5. Coverslips No.1, 50×22 mm.

Equipment: 18.1. Microwave oven.

18.2. Fluorescence microscope: a microscope capable of scanning whole slides at high resolution is recommended to facilitate image alignment and downstream analyses. For example, this protocol was developed with the Olympus VS120 Virtual Slide Microscope, which features a 40x objective, LEDs for DAPI, TRITC (spectrally similar to Cy3), FITC (spectrally similar to AF488), and Cy5, automatic focus and stitching, and a batch loader for up to 100 slides.

19.2. Aluminum foil.

19.3. Vacuum aspirator (optional). If not available, a P1000 pipette can be used instead.

19.4. 4°C refrigerator or camera.

19.5. Vortex mixer.

19.6. Plastic disposable Pasteur pipettes.

3. Methods

Figure 1a depicts a schematic of the protocol. Briefly, the first cycle is a traditional fluorescent IHC on the FFPE tissue sections followed by whole-slide imaging. Next, the coverslips are removed and the sections are treated to both denature and strip the primary and secondary antibodies and to quench any remaining fluorescent signal from the fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. In FFPE sections, microwaving is also helpful for retrieval of many antigens whose epitopes are hidden by the extensive cross-linking caused by the formaldehyde fixative [21]. After this treatment, the sections are ready for a new cycle of IHC with the next set of primary and secondary antibodies. This process of IHC-stripping/quenching-imaging is repeated up to 8 cycles. Lastly, the resulting images are aligned and subjected to the quantitative analysis pipeline.

3.1. First cycle of immunohistochemistry

Dewaxing: place the FFPE tissue sections in the slide rack and immerse twice for 10 min in successive glass dishes containing xylenes to remove the paraffin from the tissue (see Note 8).

Rehydration: immediately immerse the sections in solutions with decreasing concentrations of ethanol as follows: two different dishes with 100% ethanol for 5 min each, 95% ethanol for 5 min, and 70% ethanol for another 5 min (see Note 9).

Wash: immerse the slides in distilled water for 5 min or until being ready for step #4.

Antigen retrieval: microwave at high power a microwave-compatible dish filled with citrate buffer until boiling (~3-4 min). Immediately, switch the sections from the dish with distilled water to the dish containing boiling citrate buffer. Heat for 20 min at 95°C (i.e., typically a low power program) (see Note 10).

Cooling: cool the slides for ~45 min at 4°C (see Note 11).

Wash: immerse the slides in a dish containing TBS for 5 min. Repeat this step twice.

Hydrophobic barrier: blot the glass slides with a wipe to remove the excess TBS. Place the samples horizontally in a slide staining tray and outline the tissue using a hydrophobic barrier pen (see Note 12). Wait ~30 s to let the barrier dry.

Blocking: to avoid non-specific antibody binding, gently pipette 300 μL of blocking buffer on top of each tissue section and incubate with low speed shaking for 1 hour.

Primary antibody incubation: dilute the primary antibodies in antibody buffer at the appropriate concentrations (see Note 13). Remove the blocking buffer with vacuum aspiration (recommended) or a pipette (avoiding damage to the tissue) and add 300 μL of the primary antibody solution onto each section. Incubate overnight at 4°C without shaking in a slide moisture chamber (see Note 14).

Wash: remove the primary antibody solution and wash each section with 300 μL of TBS for 5 min with gentle shaking. Repeat this step twice.

Secondary antibody incubation: prepare a 1:200 dilution of secondary antibodies in antibody buffer. Once prepared, the secondary antibody solution should be protected from the light until its use (i.e., cover the conical tube with aluminum foil). Aspirate the TBS from the sections and apply 300 μL of the secondary antibody solution onto each section. Incubate for 2 hours at RT with gentle shaking in the dark (see Note 15).

Wash: remove the secondary antibody solution and wash each section with 300 μL of TBS for 5 min with gentle shaking in the dark. Repeat this step twice.

Autofluorescence elimination (optional, see Note 16): add 300 μL of 70% ethanol onto each section and incubate for 5 min protected from light. Add a few drops of autofluorescence eliminator reagent (or 1% Sudan Black B in 70% ethanol) to cover each section and incubate for another 5 min. After 5 min, remove the excess autofluorescence eliminator reagent by immersing the sections in three serial 1-min washes in fresh 70% ethanol.

Wash: rinse sections with 300 μL of TBS for 5 min in the dark.

DAPI staining: aspirate the TBS and add 300 μL of DAPI solution onto each section. Incubate 10 min with gentle shaking at RT in the dark.

Wash: rinse the sections with 300 μL of TBS for 10 min with gentle shaking at RT in the dark. Repeat this step twice.

Cover the slides: aspirate the TBS and add a few drops of aqueous mounting medium with DAPI (see Note 17) using a plastic Pasteur pipette. For a 2-3 cm2 tissue section, 3-4 drops should suffice to cover the entire tissue area. Carefully, place the coverslip on the slide and, using your fingers or the bottom of a tip to apply a light pressure, move any air bubbles away from the tissue ensuring that the tissue section is completely covered by mounting medium without deforming (flattening) the tissue (see Note 18). Blot the excess mounting medium with a wipe. Keep the slides at 4°C in the dark until imaging.

3.2. Imaging

Cleaning: gently wipe the coverslip and the bottom of the slide with 70% ethanol. Care should be taken to avoid displacing the coverslip and damaging the underlying tissue.

Determination of image acquisition parameters: place the slide in the fluorescence microscope and select the optimal acquisition parameters, mainly exposure time. To keep consistency across different slide batches, each marker should be scanned with the same exposure time for all sections (see Note 19). An exception to this rule is the markers to be used for alignment (i.e., DAPI and GFAP in this protocol), for which the parameters providing the best signal-to-noise ratio in the second and later cycles should prevail (see Note 20).

Scanning: if possible, scan the entire section using a fluorescence microscope (see Note 21).

Review output images for quality control: make sure that all sections are properly focused and have the same acquisition parameters, and that these parameters are valid across all sections (i.e., no saturation) before proceeding with the next step. Rescan sections that have out-of-focus areas if needed.

3.3. Antibody denaturalization and fluorescence quenching

Coverslip removal: immediately after imaging, place the slides in a rack and immerse them in a dish with coverslip removal solution. Wait until the coverslips fall off completely. Time necessary will vary from minutes to hours depending on whether air bubbles were purposefully left between the coverslips and the glass slides and the time past between coverslip placement and removal. If some slides are still covered after a few hours, gently pull up and immerse the rack ~3-5 times to facilitate this process.

Wash: after each coverslip drops, move the slides to another dish filled with TBS. Wait until all coverslips have dropped and wash the sections with TBS for at least 5 min before starting the next step.

Antibody denaturing: use the conditions previously described in steps #4-6 of section 3.1.

Fluorescence quenching: immediately after mixing the H2O2, add the fluorescence quenching solution to a Coplin jar and immerse the slides into it. Incubate for 30 min at RT (see Note 22).

Wash: immerse the slides in TBS for 5 min three times (see Note 23).

3.4. Second and successive cycles of immunohistochemistry

New IHC cycle: repeat steps #8-12 and #15-17 from section 3.1., using the recommended combination of antibodies for each IHC cycle (Fig. 1b and Table 1). Figure 2 shows an example ROI from the same tissue section labeled with each of 16 antibodies, plus the nuclear dye DAPI. The last four images illustrate the merge of all 17 channels, the 6 microglial markers, the 7 astrocytic markers, and the 2 AD pathological hallmarks (Aβ plaques and phospho-tau neurofibrillary tangles) together with DAPI and the neuronal marker HuC/D, respectively. See also Supplemental Videos for an animated version. This protocol could be customized with as many IHC cycles and antibodies as desired as long as antibodies can be stripped efficiently, and the tissue sections withstand the procedures (see Note 24).

Proceed to imaging (step #3.2.).

3.5. Image analysis

We provide two alternative workflows for the region of interest (ROI) selection, cropping, and alignment steps, which are graphically summarized in Figure 3. While in our recent publication [15] we used the cellSens image analysis software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for alignment, here we also propose an open-source option using the Fiji distribution of the public domain software ImageJ [22]. The ImageJ/Fiji macro is available here: https://github.com/serrano-pozo-lab/glia-ihc.

Image file format conversion (.vsi to .tif): opening the .vsi image files provided by the Olympus VS120 slide scanner with ImageJ/Fiji requires an additional step of conversion to .tif format using the OlympusViewer plugin.

ROI selection and cropping: create individual ROIs encompassing the same area across all IHC cycles of the same tissue section (see Note 25). Although the ROI location will vary depending on the research aims and the antibodies used, we chose ROIs from each of the six cortical layers of the temporal neocortex, which we identified using the HuC/D neuronal marker (Fig. 3). Thus, full-width 1 mm-long rectangular sections were cropped from each cortical layer to new images using the “Crop” tool in the ImageJ/Fiji Image menu or “Crop to new image” tool in cellSens. If using cellSens, it is recommended to rename the channels to the corresponding cell marker to facilitate their recognition in later steps. Next, the same ROI is selected and cropped to new images from each of the whole-slide images obtained in the remaining 7 IHC cycles of the same tissue section, using DAPI and GFAP as reference markers (see Note 26).

Alignment: the alignment process will differ depending on the software employed but see Note 27 for the possible troubleshooting needed in both cases. ImageJ/Fiji: download the MultiStackReg v1.45 plugin if not already listed in the Plugins &gt; Registration menu. Split the channels from each IHC cycle image and save them as individual files (Image &gt; Color &gt; Split Channels). Then, create a channel stack (Image &gt; Stacks &gt; Images to Stack) for all the images of each of the channels across all IHC cycles (i.e., one stack for all DAPI images, another for all Cy3-stained markers, and so on). Change all channel stacks to 8-bit grayscale images (Image &gt; Type &gt; 8-bit). In the MultiStackReg dialog, select “DAPI” as “Stack 1,” “Align” as “Action 1,” and Rigid Body as “Transformation,” then click on “Save Transformation File” followed by “Ok,” and save the resulting transformation file. If another marker has been included as reference in all IHC cycles, repeat the same process with this channel stack (in our protocol, the Cy5 stack corresponding to GFAP). Choose the best aligned stack (e.g., DAPI or GFAP) and use its transformation file to align all the other channel stacks with MultiStackReg (i.e., now select “Cy3” as “Stack 1” and “Load transformation file” in the “Action 1” dropdown menu). If two reference markers have been included in the cyclic IHC protocol, the one with worse alignment should also be realigned with the same transformation file as the other stacks. After aligning all channel stacks, convert the stacks back to images (Image &gt; Stacks &gt; Stack to Images) and, finally, convert all images from all 4 channels and all IHC cycles to a single stack (Image &gt; Stacks &gt; Images to Stack) to obtain a high-plex image.

cellSens: ensure that all .vsi image files corresponding to all IHC cycles of the same ROI are stored in one single folder and rename them using the same name followed by consecutive numbers corresponding to their position in the cyclic IHC sequence. Save this folder into a directory folder with the same name. In the Alignment Module, select the directory folder as “Source directory,” the folder containing the images as “Subdirectory,” and the desired output folder as “Destination directory.” Select DAPI or GFAP as reference channel. Tune the “Size of search area” and “Correlation threshold” to be the highest working parameters. Once aligned, convert the .vsi files to .tif format, using the OlympusViewer plugin of the ImageJ/Fiji software before the next step.

Background subtraction: to minimize background differences across sections, apply a regional background subtraction to all images with the rolling ball algorithm in ImageJ/Fiji (Process menu &gt; Subtract Background…). The rolling ball algorithm determines a local background value for every pixel by averaging over a given radius around the pixel, and this value is then subtracted from the original image to remove spatial variations in the background intensities [23]. In our protocol we used a 200-pixel radius, but users should test several radii before selecting the best option.

Single-cell segmentation 5.1. ImageJ/Fiji: 5.1.1. Manual annotation of individual profiles: for single-cell analyses, it is necessary to segment thousands of individual cell profiles. While sophisticated machine learning-based methods have been developed for automatic cell segmentation (e.g., QuPath [24]), a simple manual annotation tool such as the open-access Visual Geometry Group (VGG) Image Annotator (VIA) (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/) may also suffice. Using the VIA box tool, manually annotate all ALDH1L1+ astrocytes and IBA1+ microglia as well as all Aβ plaques and p-tau+ neurofibrillary tangles in the cropped images.

5.1.2. Profile segmentation: parse VIA profile annotations using R and convert them to ImageJ/Fiji ROIs, then segment single-cell ROIs using the ImageJ/Fiji adaptive Otsu thresholding (Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Threshold &gt; Otsu).

5.1.3. Mean gray intensity (MGI) measurement and pre-processing: measure the MGI for each astrocytic marker within each ALDH1L1+ astrocytic profile and for each microglial marker within each IBA1+ microglial profile using the Measure tool within the ImageJ/Fiji Analyze menu. Since intensity-based measurements of protein expression often follow log-normal distributions, apply a natural log transformation, and obtain the z-scores of the log-transformed MGI values [25]. While MGI is typically used as a proxy for protein expression level in fluorescent IHC, for some research objectives the area fraction (i.e., the fraction of the profile ROI occupied by each marker’s immunoreactivity) may be of interest as well. To select the parameters of interest, click on “Set Measurements” menu within the ImageJ/Fiji Analyze menu.

5.1.4. Distance between cell profiles and AD pathological lesions: record the XY coordinates of each astrocyte, microglia, Aβ plaque, and p-tau+ neurofibrillary tangle profile within each image crop, which are provided by the Measure tool in the ImageJ/Fiji Analyze menu. With these coordinates, the distance between each glial profile and the nearest Aβ plaque or -tau+ neurofibrillary tangle can be calculated using R. For Aβ plaques, the radius can be back-calculated from the area (assuming they are round) and should be subtracted from each raw distance measurement to obtain the exact distance between each glial profile and the nearest plaque edge (rather than the center of the nearest plaque).

5.2. QuPath 5.2.1. Image preparation: create a new project and open the .vsi high-plex image files or drag and drop them into the QuPath window. Select Image Type as Fluorescence and double click on each image to select it and display it in the main window. To select and view each of the channels, select them in the View &gt; Brightness and Contrast menu. Rename the channels with the corresponding marker names.

5.2.2. Automatic profile segmentation: draw a rectangular annotation (i.e., yellow box) over the entire image, then open the cell detection menu (Analyze &gt; Cell detection) and select the detection channel of interest (e.g., ALDH1L1 for astrocytes, IBA1 for microglia, Aβ for plaques, and p-tau for tangles). Tune the cell detection parameters to optimize the segmentation results and click Run.

5.2.3. MGI and distance measurements: go to the Hierarchy &gt; Annotation (Rectangle) to see a summary of the measurements for the annotation rectangle (i.e., number of detected cells). Open the drop-down list of all the cells detected within the Annotation rectangle and see the measurements for each cell across all channels in the bottom window. To tabulate all measurements, go to Measure &gt; Show detection measurements. The “Nucleus: Marker mean” column contains the MGI of each cell, whereas the “Centroid X px” and “Centroid Y px” columns correspond to the X and Y coordinates of the cells, which will be used to calculate their distance to the nearest AD pathological hallmark. Click “Save” to export these results for downstream analyses. To crop the cells detected in QuPath to individual single-cell images in ImageJ/Fiji, select all detected cells in the Hierarchy window and click on the ImageJ tollbar button or go to Extensions &gt; ImageJ &gt; Send region to ImageJ. In the dialog box, keep “Resolution” at 1 pixel (i.e., no downsampling) and unselect “Include ROI,” “Include overlay,” and “Apply color transforms;” ImageJ/Fiji should automatically open with the single-cell ROIs created.

Quantitative analyses: the highly dimensional dataset resulting from this image analysis pipeline can inform various downstream analyses. First, in the simplest approach, single-cell MGI data for each marker can be compared between control and diseased brains to determine whether there are statistically significant changes in its expression levels associated with the disease. To this end, mixed effect models are most appropriate to control for within donor’s correlation (since profiles from the same donor are not independent observations) [26]. Second, unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms could be applied to cluster MGI data into different cellular phenotypes or states based on the expression levels of the selected combination of markers. These include spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering, and k-means clustering, among others. Lastly, supervised classifiers can be trained to discern between health and disease diagnoses using either the MGI data or the actual high-plex single-cell images (via convolutional neural networks).

(b) Sequence of antibodies used to phenotype astrocytes and microglia in healthy control and Alzheimer’s disease brains. The host species of the primary antibodies (Ms = mouse, Rb = rabbit, and Gt = goat) and the fluorophores conjugated to the secondary antibodies (red = Cy3, green = AF488, magenta = Cy5) are indicated.

Figure 2. Example of cyclic multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry from a cortical region of interest (ROI).

The individual images of an ROI from layer III of the same temporal cortex FFPE section of an AD donor, which was immunolabeled with 16 different primary antibodies across 8 IHC cycles and stained with the nuclear dye DAPI, are shown. Markers are distributed by cell type/feature (astrocytes, microglia, and AD lesions/neurons/DAPI). The last 4 merge images result from the alignment of all 17 channels, the 6 microglial markers, the 7 astrocytic markers, and the 2 AD pathological hallmarks (Aβ plaques and p-tau neurofibrillary tangles) together with DAPI and the neuronal marker HuC/D, respectively. Scale bar: 50 μm.

Figure 3. Image analysis pipeline.

HuC/D neuronal staining (scale bar: 100 μm) is used to define the cortical layers (I-VI) vs. the white matter (WM). The GFAP (or DAPI) channel repeated in each IHC cycle is used for alignment of all images across IHC cycles using the cellSens Alignment Module or the ImageJ/Fiji MultiStackReg plugin. Single-cell segmentation of the resulting high-plex stacks is achieved using either a semiautomated approach with VGG VIA followed by a custom ImageJ/Fiji macro (available in https://github.com/serrano-pozo-lab/glia-ihc) or an automatic segmentation tool such as QuPath Cell Detection. Quantitative analyses may include disease vs. control comparisons of mean gray intensity data by marker, clustering of high-plex single-cell level intensity data to identify phenotypes or states within a cell type, and machine learning classifiers based on single-cell level intensity data or on all features of high-plex single-cell images (i.e., convolutional neural networks).

Abbreviations: AF488 = AlexaFluor 488; Cy = cyanine; Dk = donkey; Gt = goat; Ms = mouse; Rb = rabbit. All secondary antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution and purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA.

Note 1. Both duration of fixation and fixative used could affect the results because some antibodies are extremely fixation-sensitive (reviewed in [27]).

Note 2. Besides DAPI, GFAP is included in all cycles to ensure an accurate alignment of the images obtained in each of the IHC rounds. This is because the DAPI signal intensity may fade after several cycles and because the star-like shape of GFAP+ astrocytes greatly facilitates the image alignment relative to relying only on the round or oval shape of DAPI+ nuclei.

Note 3. The secondary antibodies should be protected from light to avoid fluorophore quenching. Use aluminum foil to cover conical tubes after their dilution in antibody buffer.

Note 4. Xylenes are irritant and flammable. Work in a hood and handle with gloves.

Note 5. Care should be taken since ethanol is flammable.

Note 6. To guarantee an accurate measurement in the face Tween20 high viscosity, cut off around 3 mm of the 1 mL pipette tip, and aspirate and release the Tween20 very slowly.

Note 7. Use a slide tray made of an opaque material or, alternatively, cover the tray with aluminum foil to protect sections from the light during the incubation with secondary antibodies and subsequent steps.

Note 8. From this point on, the slides should never be allowed to dry. Drying out will cause high background autofluorescence.

Note 9. Ethanol solutions can be reused several times.

Note 10. Citrate buffer should completely fill the container to avoid that excessive evaporation during the 20 min heating step dries out the tissue samples. Make sure that the slide holder, rack, and dish are compatible with microwave. Test the available microwave programs with a citrate buffer-filled dish and a thermometer before experimenting with the FFPE sections to determine which program maintains the temperature at 95°C.

Note 11. To avoid spillover accidents leading to burns, use protective gloves and carefully discard the excess citrate buffer in the sink before moving the slide dish to the refrigerator.

Note 12. Care should be taken to avoid touching the tissue with the hydrophobic barrier pen. While the tissue should never dry out, it is important to blot the excess TBS with a wipe (simply tapping the slide edge on the wipe) because, if the slide is too wet, the barrier could mix with the TBS and ruin the tissue.

Note 13. The dilution for each specific antibody should be previously tested on separate FFPE sections using the “first cycle of immunohistochemistry” protocol (section 3.1.).

Note 14. To avoid the evaporation of the primary antibody solution, which can lead to an edge effect (i.e., higher background fluorescence in the edges of the section), it is important to create a moisture chamber. To achieve this, simply place some wipes soaked with water inside the staining tray.

Note 15. From this point on, samples should be protected from light to avoid the fluorophore quenching prior to imaging.

Note 16. We recommend adding this step to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the first cycle of IHC if tissue autofluorescence, typically due to aging-related accumulation of lipofuscin granules, is an issue and/or the primary antibodies used in this cycle typically yield a dim or a punctate signal difficult to discern from lipofuscin granules [28, 29]. Filter the autofluorescence eliminator reagent through a 22 μm pore size nylon filter using a 3 mL syringe to remove any precipitates.

Note 17. DAPI is added twice (in solution in TBS and with the mounting medium) to ensure an adequate staining of all cell nuclei that facilitates the image alignment across IHC cycles, since the DAPI signal tends to fade away in the last cycles.

Note 18. To reduce tissue damage during coverslip removal (step #1, Section 3.3.), cover the sections immediately before imaging and remove the coverslip shortly after the completing the scanning so that the adherence of the coverslip to the tissue is still weak. To expedite the coverslip removal, it is also helpful to keep some air bubbles between the coverslip and the slide, but beyond the perimeter of the tissue section so as to not interfere with the image alignment.

Note 19. Before scanning the whole slides, check that the selected exposure time is adequate to detect the antigen of interest properly across samples despite the expected inter-donor variability. For example, if the exposure time is selected only based on the signal from control samples, some markers could be saturated in diseased samples, and vice versa.

Note 20. After the first IHC cycle, repeat another marker (e.g., GFAP) besides DAPI in the successive IHC rounds to facilitate the alignment of the images obtained from the same section. Since this marker signal may also fade over multiple cycles, adjust individually its exposure time to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio for each cycle and each section with the primary goal of ensuring an accurate alignment (step #2, section 3.5). However, make sure you only use the DAPI and GFAP images from the first IHC cycle (i.e., acquired with the same exposure time across all samples) for downstream quantitative analyses.

Note 21. Although tissue damage is relatively limited even after 8 cycles of IHC, some tissue sections may suffer alterations in some areas (Fig. 4). Therefore, to ensure optimal alignment, scan whole slides to be able to select ROIs devoid of any damage across all cycles (section 3.5).

Note 22. The treatment with this oxidizing alkaline solution produces an irreversible inactivation by oxidation of the fluorophore conjugated with any secondary antibody that may have remained bound to the tissue after the previous denaturation step [17–19].

Note 23. Optionally, at this point one could cover the sections with mounting medium with DAPI and proceed to reimaging (step #3.2) to confirm that the signal from the previous cycle has been removed. However, this check is usually unnecessary because (1) pilot studies should have already demonstrated this; (2) any remaining faint signal will likely be obscured by the stronger signal of the new set of primary antibodies in the following IHC cycle; and (3) an additional step of coverslip placement and removal may increase the risk of tissue damage.

Note 24. Here we report our protocol with 7 astroglial, 6 microglial, 1 neuronal, Aβ, and p-tau markers (Table 1). To design a new antibody sequence, it is helpful to have prior single-cycle IHC experience with the desired antibodies and to test the efficiency of the stripping/quenching step. The antibodies with faintest signal (or those that recognize the least abundant antigens) should be placed in the initial IHC cycles, whereas the antibodies with strongest signal (or those which bind the most abundant antigens) should be postponed to the last IHC rounds, as they are typically more difficult to strip from the sections (e.g., Aβ and p-tau in AD tissue). A thoughtful order of antibodies is also critical to detect a possible cross-reactivity between the secondary antibodies applied in one cycle and any non-stripped primary antibodies remaining from the prior cycle. A recommended strategy is to place antibodies with the same host species in consecutive cycles only if they produce a markedly different staining pattern (i.e., diffuse/cytosolic vs. punctate/organelle vs. membranous/surface) or if they stain different cell types. For instance, in our custom protocol we deliberately alternated microglia- and astrocyte-specific primary antibodies produced in the same host species in consecutive cycles. However, whenever we had to use primary antibodies produced in the same host species and labeling the same cell type in consecutive cycles, we chose those with the most distinct patterns of staining (e.g., we used a rabbit anti-TSPO in cycle #1 and a rabbit anti-TMEM119 in cycle #2 to label microglia but, because the former produces a punctate staining [mitochondria] and the latter yields a membranous one, we were able to rule out the cross-reactivity of the donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody applied in cycle #2 with the rabbit anti-TSPO primary antibody used in cycle #1). Consider also including an extra new section of one of the donors as internal control in each IHC round to validate the results.

Note 25. Due to their large size, aligning whole-section images across 8 cycles would require the power of a computing cluster, which is not accessible to every lab. Moreover, minimal tissue damage, out-of-focus spots, or staining artifacts can preclude a correct alignment of the whole-section scans.

Note 26. Carefully selecting the exact same ROI across the different cycles is critical for the proper alignment of the images (i.e., although this is time-consuming, selecting identical ROIs will pay off). To this end, save the ROIs from the original IHC images using the ROI Manager tool in the Fiji Analyze menu or the ROI tool in cellSens, and copy and paste these ROIs in all the images from the successive IHC cycles. Before proceeding with the cropping of those ROIs, visually check that the tissue is intact and the image is well focused across all IHC cycles. If this is not the case, the alignment may fail, so look for another ROI that meets these criteria.

Note 27. The first step to troubleshoot a misalignment is to double check that the ROI of the reference marker is exactly the same across IHC cycles or as close as possible (see Note 26). Reasons for misalignment include tissue deformation during the coverslip placement and removal, a slight rotation of the glass slide across scans, or a staining artifact. If the misalignment is due to rotation of the slide across scans, the problem can be solved by creating a crop larger than the ROI in the most rotated image, then rotating it to the angle most similar to all other cycles, then creating a crop within this crop that matches the definite ROI. If a staining artifact (e.g., fluorescent dot, tissue hole or fold) is interfering with the alignment, just remove it by selecting the area around it and using the “Clear” tool in the Fiji Edit menu.
