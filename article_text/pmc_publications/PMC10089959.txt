Background

Understanding changes in nursing home resident pain over time would provide a more informed perspective, allowing opportunities to alter the course of illness, plan care and set priorities. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to identify and characterize clinically meaningful, dynamic pain trajectories in nursing home residents.

Methods

Retrospective longitudinal analysis of nursing home resident pain scores with a length of stay &gt; 100 days (N=4,864). Group based trajectory modeling was applied to Minimum Data Set 3.0 assessments to identify pain trajectories. Trajectories were then characterized using unadjusted and adjusted cross-sectional associations between residents’ demographic and clinical characteristics and their pain trajectory.

Results

We identified four distinct trajectories: 1) consistent pain absence (48.9%), 2) decreasing-increasing pain presence (21.8%), 3) increasing-decreasing pain presence (15.3%), and 4) persistent pain presence (14.0%). Demographics of younger age and living in a rural area were associated with the persistent pain presence trajectory. Clinical variables of obesity and intact cognition were associated with being in the persistent pain presence trajectory. A smaller proportion of residents with moderately or severely impaired cognition were in any of the trajectory groups with pain.

Conclusions

We identified and characterized four pain trajectories among NH residents, including persistent pain presence which was associated with demographic characteristics (younger, female, rural) and clinical factors (obese, fracture, contracture). Moreover, residents with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia were less likely to be in any of the three trajectories with pain, likely representing the difficulty in evaluating pain in these residents. It is important that nursing home staff understand, recognize and respond to the factors associated with the identified pain trajectories to improve mitigation of potentially persistent pain (e.g., hip fracture, contracture) or improve proxy pain assessment skills for residents at risk for under reporting of pain (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease).

Brief Summary:

pmcINTRODUCTION

Pain in nursing home (NH) residents is common and negatively impacts outcomes. Up to 85.0% of older adults living in a NH experience pain and up to 58.5% have persistent pain. Pain in NH residents is associated with poor quality of life and higher likelihood of depression, decreased happiness, decreased life satisfaction, greater ADL dependency, and more sleep problems.1

Approaches to improving recognition of pain in NH residents have aimed to identify factors associated with pain in NH residents,2-4 develop improved pain assessment tools5-9 and improve staff pain assessment knowledge.10-12 Although many researchers are working to ameliorate pain in NH residents, most have done so using a cross-sectional approach. The use of a cross-sectional design fails to consider how the course or trajectory of pain changes over time. Understanding the trajectory of pain experience may provide opportunities to alter the course of illness, prevent adverse outcomes, and provide supportive therapies to improve quality of life.

Trajectories of pain in NH residents have not been well-described or characterized as existing studies are limited. Using growth mixture modeling, Brennan et al identified 9-month pain trajectory groups and the influence of mental health disorders on group membership, in a sample of 2,539 department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Center residents.13 Residents of VA nursing facilities tend to be younger, almost all male and have more complex medical and behavioral conditions than residents in the general population of nursing home residents. This includes increased prevalence of serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia), posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder,14 and is noted by the study’s authors as a limiting factor of this research. In an additional study, using five measurement points within a 14-day period, Landmark et al, identified and characterized four distinct pain trajectories in a sample of 201 Norwegian NH residents.15 However, the trajectory beyond 14 days is unknown. Finally, in a third study, Thompson et al identified pain trajectories during the 6 months before death in a sample of 962 NH residents in Western Canada.16 Pain trajectories were generally described but not characterized.16 It is unknown whether resident sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were associated with these different trajectory patterns. In addition, the identified trajectories were not generalizable to residents not in the final 6 months of life.

Moreover, the impact of pain trajectories on mortality has not been described for a general sample of NH residents. Using two longitudinal population cohorts of adults ages 50 and older in private households, Smith et al, identified that individuals who were “often troubled with pain” or reported pain interference with normal work activities were at increased risk of mortality.17 It is unclear if this association is applicable to older adults living in NHs.

Understanding how NH resident pain changes over time and the factors associated with belonging to an adverse pain trajectory (i.e., one that remains persistently present) will provide a more informed perspective, allowing opportunities to alter the course of illness, plan care and set priorities, prevent adverse outcomes, and provide supportive therapies to improve quality of life. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis was to characterize clinically meaningful, dynamic pain trajectories in NH residents. The main goals were to 1) define pain trajectories based on the presence of pain using group-based trajectory modeling, 2) identify demographic and clinical correlates, and 3) examine associations between trajectories and mortality.

METHODS

Design

The MDS 3.0 data used in this analysis were originally used as part of a CMS demonstration project, Optimizing Patient Transfers, Impacting Medical quality, and Improving Symptoms: Transforming Institutional Care (OPTIMISTIC). Briefly, OPTIMISTIC was designed to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations of long-stay NH residents. The details and methodologies used during the original project are described elsewhere.18,19 We conducted a longitudinal analysis of MDS 3.0 data using a sample of NH residents who resided in 44 OPTIMISTIC NHs between September 27, 2011, to December 16, 2019. This analysis was approved as exempt by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board.

Data

The MDS is a source of assessment information for residents in nursing homes certified to participate in the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Comprehensive MDS assessments are completed upon admission, annually and with any significant change in condition. A subset of questions is administered quarterly. Originally conceived to monitor resident health and improve the care plan process through improving resident assessment,20 the MDS is a rich source of standardized clinical data obtained from nearly every NH resident in the United States. The MDS 3.0 was updated in 2010 from the prior version, MDS 2.0, to include direct resident interview, including the residents self-report of their pain.21

Sample

Data represented 23,167 NH residents who were admitted to one of 44 Indiana nursing homes between September 27, 2011, to December 16, 2019. Residents were excluded from this analysis if data indicated they had 1) length of stay &lt;100 days (n=13,622 excluded); or 2) less than three pain observation time points (n=4,681 excluded).

Measurements

The MDS data contains assessment of pain presence measured over the previous 5 days with the question, “Have you had pain or hurting at any time in the last 5 days?” (yes/no). For residents unable to complete the interview for pain, such as those with severe dementia, standard procedure was to use a proxy assessment. We have included all available pain presence measurement scores from the time of admission to discharge, or a maximum of 28 assessment time periods.

Cognitive function is assessed using the cognitive function scale (CFS).22 CFS is categorized as intact, mildly impaired, moderately impaired, or severely impaired cognition, using information extracted from MDS assessments.

Demographic variables (gender, age, race, rurality), clinical variables (body mass index, hospice enrollment, life expectancy &lt; 6 months) and clinical comorbidities (arthritis, fracture, contracture, diabetes, Alzheimer Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)) were assessed using the admission assessment. These defined variables were selected for inclusion in this analysis based on a recent systematic review indicating evidence of associations between these variables and pain in NH residents.1

Mortality during the study time frame was collected from the last MDS in the analysis time period for each individual resident. Mortality was defined as death from any cause and recorded as a binary variable (yes/no).

Data Analysis

We conducted descriptive analyses to describe the characteristics of the study cohort. Pain trajectories were identified using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM), a flexible and easily applied method for identifying subgroups within a population that follow distinctive trajectories.23 GBTM allows for heterogeneity through the estimation of group trajectories instead of assuming the sample is homogeneous as in traditional regression.23-26 This approach is a specialized application of finite mixture modeling that identifies meaningful subgroups of patients based on their patterns of change (trajectories) within a population over time. Unlike growth mixture modeling, GBTM uses maximum likelihood estimation to approximate an unknown distribution of trajectories and does not assume that latent classes represent distinct populations.24,27 Length of stay for each assessment was used as a measure of time due to the de-identified nature of this dataset. Residents who experienced study attrition (defined as either death or discharge during the study population) were included in the GBTM analysis using an enhanced version of the methodology that jointly estimates the outcome of interest, pain, and the probability of dropping out of observation due to mortality.28 To avoid obscuring the analysis based on a small set of surviving residents, we restricted the maximum observations per resident to 28, reducing the influence of outlying observations. The maximum likelihood method was used to fit a discrete-mixture model to the longitudinal data. Analyses were conducted using traj26 in Stata 17.

Trajectories were modeled as a binary distribution using pain presence (yes/no). The optimal number of trajectories (one to six) and shape (constant, linear, quadratic, cubic, or quartic terms) were selected using the Schwarz formulation of the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The model with the highest BIC (least negative) that also demonstrated a BIC change of ≥10 was selected. For each trajectory, the shapes were varied until the best-fitting model was identified using the maximum BIC. The fit was confirmed by evaluating the average of the posterior probability of trajectory assignment (with &lt;0.70 considered a poor fit23) and odds of correct classification (≥5.023). (See Supplementary Tables 1 &amp; 2)

To characterize trajectories, we assessed associations between trajectories and cognitive function, demographic, clinical comorbidities, and mortality using chi-square tests. Any characteristic with a p value &lt; 0.05 were included in the logistic regression analysis. Descriptive statistics, chi-square analysis, and logistic regression analysis were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 28.

RESULTS

Demographic Characteristics

The final analytic sample was 4,864 NH residents and 46,103 total pain assessments. At admission, 63.9% were female. The sample age ranges were &lt; 60 (8.8%), 60-69 (11.9%), 70-79 (21.9%), 80-89 (37.0%), and ≥ 90 (20.4%). Most were White (87.3%) or Black (11.6%) with few being Hispanic (0.6%) or other race/ethnicities (0.5%). Most (76.7%) lived in an urban area. BMI ranged from underweight (8.5%), normal (38.8%), overweight (27.8%) to obese (24.9%). Very few residents were on hospice (2.1%) or had a life expectancy of &lt; 6 months (1.8%). Cognitive function varied from intact (31.9%) to impaired mildly (25.9%), moderately (37.2%) or severely (3.3%). Less than half the sample died within the analysis time period (40.4%).

Pain Trajectories

As shown in Figure 1, four distinct pain trajectories emerged: 1) consistent pain absence (48.9%) [pain consistently absent]; 2) decreasing-increasing pain presence (21.8%) [pain presence initially decreased, held steady, then increased over time]; 3) increasing-decreasing pain presence (15.3%) [pain presence initially increased, held steady, then decreased]; and 4) persistent pain presence (14.0%) [pain consistently present].

Characterizing Pain Trajectories

Table 1 shows the results of the characterization of the four trajectories by demographic variables, clinical variables, clinical comorbidities and mortality based on chi-square analyses.

Demographic Variables

Demographic variables of age and rurality were associated with the persistent pain presence trajectory subgroup. A greater proportion of residents with ages &lt;60 and 60-69 and smaller proportions of residents with ages 80-89 and 90+ in the persistent pain presence trajectory (p&lt;.001). In addition, a greater proportion of residents living in a rural location were in the persistent pain trajectory (p&lt;.001).

Clinical Characteristics

The clinical variables obesity and intact cognition were associated with being in the persistent pain presence trajectory subgroup. Whereas smaller proportions of residents with moderately or severely impaired cognition were in any of the trajectory groups with pain. For body mass index, greater proportion of residents with obesity and smaller proportions of residents with normal body mass index were in any of the trajectory groups with pain (p&lt;.001). Regarding cognitive function a larger proportion of residents with intact cognition were in the persistent pain presence trajectory (61.8%) versus the consistent pain absence trajectory (21.3%). Whereas smaller proportions of residents with moderately or severely impaired cognition were in any of the trajectory groups with pain (p&lt;.001). All comorbid conditions except for stroke and ADRD were positively associated with being in one of the trajectory groups with pain. Whereas ARDR was negatively associated with being in one of the trajectory groups with pain.

Supplementary Table 3 shows adjusted multinomial model results for pain trajectories. Compared to residents in the consistent pain absence trajectory, residents in the persistent pain presence trajectory were more likely to be female (AOR 1.52, CI 1.24-1.88, p&lt;.001), rurally located (AOR 2.75, CI 2.20-3.43, p&lt;.001), obese (AOR 1.32, CI 1.02-1.71, p=.037) with intact (AOR 6.70, CI 3.21-13.78, p&lt;.001), or mildly impaired cognition (AOR 2.79, CI 1.34-5.82, p=.006), arthritis (AOR 1.49, 1.19-1.86, p&lt;.001), hip fracture (AOR 4.29 CI 2.61-7.04, p&lt;.001), fracture (other than hip) (AOR 2.89, CI 2.03-4.11, p&lt;.001), contracture (AOR 1.75, CI 1.43-2.13, p&lt;.001), anxiety disorder (AOR 1.55, CI 1.23-1.95, p&lt;.001), heart failure (AOR 1.37, CI 1.07-1.75, p=.011), PVD/PAD (AOR 1.51, CI 1.01-2.25, p=.045). In contrast residents with a diagnosis of ADRD were less likely to be in the persistent pain presence trajectory (AOR 0.34, CI 0.27-0.44, p&lt;.001).

Relative to the consistent pain absence trajectory, the odds of being in any one of the other three trajectories with pain was higher for residents who were living in a rural location (AORs range 1.41 to 2.75), obese (AORs range 1.248 to 1.37), with hip fracture (AORs range 1.26 to 5.64), fracture (other than hip) (AORs range 1.38 to 3.34), or contracture (AORs range 1.31 to 11.75). In addition, also relative to the consistent pain absence trajectory, the odds of being in any one of the other three trajectories was lower for residents with a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia (AORs range 0.34 to 0.73).

Pain Trajectories and Mortality

For mortality a greater proportion of residents that died during the analysis time period were in the increasing-decreasing trajectory (45.6%) compared to the consistent pain absence trajectory (41.3%), decreasing-increasing trajectory (39.2%), or persistent pain presence trajectory (33.4%). After controlling for all covariates in the model, residents in the increasing-decreasing trajectory were at 42.0% greater risk of mortality (AOR 1.42, CI 1.19-1.70, p&lt;.001) versus the consistent pain absence trajectory.

DISCUSSION

In this analysis, we present the first evidence of four distinct pain trajectories among NH residents using group-based trajectory modeling. Pain trajectories capture the complex and dynamic (temporal) nature of pain and have implications for both clinical assessment and research. After pain trajectories emerged, we characterized them in terms of demographics, clinical variables, and mortality.

Pain Trajectories

The four pain trajectories identified in this analysis tended to represent contrasting pain patterns, either steady state (consistent pain absence; persistent pain presence) or changing over time (increasing-decreasing pain presence; decreasing-increasing pain presence). All four pain trajectories exhibit a period of stability. The two dynamic groups tend to have a change at the beginning and end of the trajectory separated by a period of stabilization. After this period of stabilization, both trajectories tend to return toward their initial pain occurrence level. For example, the decreasing-increasing pain presence trajectory starts with a high occurrence of pain, declines, stabilizes, and then trends toward an increasing occurrence of pain. A similar pattern repeats with the increasing-decreasing pain presence trajectory, although this trajectory begins and ends with a lower occurrence of pain. The source of this period of stabilization is unclear although it may indicate a time in which physical, emotional and cognitive comorbidities remain stable. Moreover, this stabilization may indicate regression toward the mean for individuals with a trajectory subgroup. Understanding the source of this stabilization may be important in driving change to reduce pain in this population.

Characterizing Pain Trajectories

Compared to the consistent pain absence trajectory, the common factors associated with pain across all three trajectories with pain were female gender, living rurally, intact cognition, and contracture. Residents with normal BMI or a diagnosis of ADRD were less likely to be in any of the three pain trajectories. Younger, female residents who lived rurally, were obese, had fracture (hip or other) or contracture were more likely to be in the persistent pain presence trajectory. Our findings are important because they provide clinically relevant evidence that can improve recognition of risk factors associated with pain persistence in NH residents.

Knowing the demographic and clinical correlates of the identified trajectories is important for clinicians. This information may be used to identify residents at increased risk for experiencing pain that persists over time, thus providing an opportunity to intervene and alter the trajectory. Moreover, the converse is also true. Identifying residents likely to be underrepresented in the pain trajectories, such as individuals with ADRD, may provide impetus for nursing home staff to improve pain assessment and evaluation skills. We provide a brief discussion of several factors we believe are important.

Hip Fracture

Hip fracture in our study was associated with a five-fold increased risk for persistent pain. In the United States, nearly 32,000 NH residents fracture their hip each year,29 leading to functional decline,30,31 poor quality of life,31 and increased risk of mortality.32 Acute fracture is commonly associated with increased acute pain, but no prior studies have evaluated how this pain changes over time. Hip fracture in our study was associated with a five-fold increased risk for persistent pain presence over time. Understanding this increased risk for persistent pain allows residents and clinicians to plan care and set priorities.

Living in Rural Area

Living in a rural location was also identified as a significant predictor of persistent pain presence. This may be due to decreased resources available outside of large urban centers to identify and treat pain. Most pain specialty practices, and palliative care practices are located within an urban setting, necessitating great effort to obtain a specialty consultation to reduce pain for those living in rural settings in Indiana.33-35 Alternatively, rural residents are more likely to have pain and not request pain medication.36 Rural disparities in pain management for NH residents provides an important area of future research and intervention.

ADRD

Finally, consistent with prior studies, we identified lower likelihood of persistent pain for individuals with ADRD.3,4,37,38 This finding likely represents both the under assessment and under reporting of pain among cognitively impaired NH residents. Pain assessment for residents unable to self-report pain, relies on the ability of staff to infer pain from behaviors such as grimacing, yelling out, or guarding a body part, but inferring pain is difficult. To improve quality of life and pain management for residents with cognitive impairment a change in pain assessment such as the movement-based pain assessment in older adults may be necessary.39 Future directions in this area are exciting, but additional research is needed to support practice changes.

Pain Trajectories and Mortality

Incorporating mortality into analysis of pain trajectories is an important step because those who survive across periods of observation and those who die in the interim may follow distinctly different pain trajectories. The group-based trajectory modeling approach is well suited to summarizing large numbers of individual trajectories and allows for the inclusion of the experience of both survivors and decedents. Limiting the analysis to survivors would have resulted in substantially different pain trajectories that do not truly reflect the experience of NH residents, many of whom are approaching death. In this analysis, the increasing-decreasing trajectory was at significantly greater risk for mortality. This group consisted of a higher proportion of residents who were underweight or diagnosed with ADRD, possibly indicating increased frailty. Unfortunately, a frailty measure was not included in the MDS dataset. Moreover, the persistent pain presence group was at lower risk for mortality. This may be due in part that residents in the persistent pain present trajectory were younger and had a lower prevalence of cognitive impairment. Research is needed to further evaluate this association.

Strengths and Limitations

Some limitations should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. First, we were unable to use age in determining trajectory groups. For residents aged 90 years and above, the age in the de-identified dataset was categorized as 90 or older. This age limitation may obscure some important dynamic relationships that vary based upon age in the oldest old. For this reason, future work is recommended to model age-based pain trajectories. In addition, this analysis does not account for comorbid conditions that change over time or the use of pain treatments meant to improve pain. Future refinements and expansion of our analysis should include investigating time-varying covariates such as cognitive function and use of analgesic medications. The use of a sample of NH residents that were part of a demonstration project, that provided enhanced geriatric care, potentially limit generalizability of findings. Finally, relying on MDS data alone, including the binary nature of the data (pain presence yes/no) limits the ability to reflect the complex nature of pain that goes beyond its change over time.

Despite these limitations, this analysis has several strengths. First our analysis included a large and diverse sample. In addition, our use of comprehensive standardized measures (MDS) facilitates comparison with other clinical studies conducted in the NH setting. Finally, we included NH residents with various levels of cognition. Many times, NH residents with cognitive impairment are excluded from studies due to difficulties in assessing their pain and obtaining informed consent. Use of previously collected MDS data allowed us to overcome this issue.

CONCLUSIONS

We identified and characterized four pain trajectories among NH residents, including persistent pain presence which was associated with demographic characteristics (younger, female, rural) and clinical factors (obese, fracture (hip or other), contracture). Moreover, residents with a diagnosis of ADRD were less likely to be in any of the three trajectories with pain, likely representing the difficulty in evaluating pain in these residents. It is important that nursing home staff understand, recognize and respond to the factors associated with the identified pain trajectories to improve mitigation of potentially persistent pain (e.g., hip fracture, contracture) or improve proxy pain assessment skills for residents at risk for under reporting of pain (e.g., ADRD). Further research to examine the biological underpinnings of each trajectory may elucidate unique genetic and biomarker profiles, leading to further refinement of dynamic pain trajectories.

Key Points:

1) We present the first evidence of four distinct pain trajectories among nursing home residents using group-based trajectory modeling; 2) The four pain trajectories identified in this analysis tended to represent contrasting pain patterns, either steady state (consistent pain absence; persistent pain presence) or changing over time (increasing-decreasing pain presence; decreasing-increasing pain presence). 3) Persistent pain presence was associated with demographic characteristics (younger age, female, rural) and clinical factors (obese, fracture, contracture).

Why does this matter?

It is important that nursing home staff understand, recognize and respond to factors associated with the identified pain trajectories to improve mitigation of potentially persistent pain (e.g., hip fracture, contracture) or improve proxy pain assessment skills for residents at risk for under reporting of pain (e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease).
