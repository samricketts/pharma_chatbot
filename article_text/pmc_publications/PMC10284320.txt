Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial, chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), activated microglial cells, and an inflammatory state (involving reactive oxygen species production) in the brain. NFTs are comprised of misfolded and hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-binding protein tau. Interestingly, the trimeric form of the 2N4R splice isoform of tau has been found to be more toxic than the trimeric 1N4R isoform in neuron precursor cells. Few drug discovery programs have focused on specific tau isoforms. The present drug discovery project is centered on the anti-aggregation effect of a series of seventeen 4- or 5-aminoindole carboxamides on the 2N4R isoform of tau. The selection of the best compounds was performed using α-synuclein (α-syn). The anti-oligomer and -fibril activities of newly synthesized aminoindole carboxamide derivatives were evaluated with biophysical methods, such as thioflavin T fluorescence assays, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins, and transmission electron microscopy. To evaluate the reduction of inclusions and cytoprotective effects, M17D neuroblastoma cells expressing inclusion-forming α-syn were treated with the best amide representatives. The 4-aminoindole carboxamide derivatives exhibited a better anti-fibrillar activity compared to their 5-aminoindole counterparts. The amide derivatives 2, 8, and 17 exerted anti-oligomer and anti-fibril activities on α-syn and the 2N4R isoform of tau. At a concentration of 40 μM, compound 8 reduced inclusion formation in M17D neuroblastoma cells expressing inclusion-prone αSynuclein3K::YFP. Our results demonstrate the potential of 4-aminoindole carboxamide derivatives with regard to inhibiting the oligomer formation of α-syn and tau (2N4R isoform) for further optimization prior to pre-clinical studies.

pmcintroduction

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) can trace their origin to protein fibrillization, the process by which a misfolded protein develops fibrils [1]. Two major neuropathological hallmarks characterize typical AD, the accumulation of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain [2,3]. NFTs contain misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tubulin associated unit (tau) protein [2,3]. Hypothetically, Aβ plaques accumulate in the brain and consequently activate microglia, neuroimmune cells involved in sensing, housekeeping, and defense of the central nervous system (CNS) [4]. These microglial cells then adopt pro-inflammatory states, which contribute to the hyperphosphorylation of tau (p-tau) and drive the spread of misfolded p-tau, but doesn’t constitute necessarily an upstream event in aggregation. The insolubility of tau protein fibrils leads to the formation of NFTs. Importantly, it is believed that tau oligomers contribute to neuron toxicity [5–7] and may have an important role in AD neurodegeneration. The spatiotemporal distribution of NFTs has been shown to coincide with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment [8,9].

The tau protein is expressed as six naturally-occurring isoforms in the human brain, all of which vary by the presence or absence of inserts encoded by the Tau gene [10]. These six isoforms (0N3R, 0N4R, 1N3R, 1N4R, 2N3R, 2N4R) are transcribed in the human brain by alternative splicing and are expressed in different ratios during neurodegeneration, resulting in tau pathological effects [11]. Each isoform is distinguished by two criteria: the absence, presence, or partial presence of two 29 amino acid inserts encoded by exons 2 and 3 resulting in 0N (no insert), 1N (one insert), or 2N (two inserts) tau; and the presence (4R) or absence (3R) of the R2 domain of the microtubule binding domain region (MTBR) in addition to the already present R1, R3, and R4 domains [11]. Tau isoforms are differentially expressed across the hippocampus during various stages of development; in fetal stages only the 0N3R isoform is expressed while all six isoforms are expressed in adulthood [12]. In healthy adults the ratio of 3R to 4R isoforms is approximately 1:1 [11,13]. In AD brains, this ratio becomes skewed with the 3R isoform becoming preferentially added to the tau fibrils as the disease progresses [14]. Isoform 4R on the other hand is more efficient at promoting microtubule assembly compared to 3R with the R1-R2 region being unique to 4R-Tau; when the ratio of 4R to 3R drastically increases in the human brain this leads to Argyrophilic Grain Disease (AGD), a form of dementia [12,15,16]. The 1:1 ratio of 3R and 4R isoforms is important to maintain as seen by the progression of neurodegenerative diseases when this ratio is altered towards the 3R or 4R direction.

Our drug discovery program seeks to incorporate amide compounds and evaluate their effectiveness in preventing tau oligomer and fibril formation. With sparse prior studies to explore the amide anti-aggregation activity on α-synuclein (α-syn) and tau, we have prepared eighteen compounds containing a carboxamide functional group and have pre-evaluated their anti-fibrillary activity on α-syn, a protein associated with PD [17], in order to narrow down the most effective compounds in reducing tau aggregation. The most promising compounds were then evaluated for their anti-fibrillary activity on the 2N4R isoform of tau. The 2N4R isoform of tau is the largest at 67 KDa [13]. Extracellular phosphorylated tau isoform 2N4R p-tau induces microglial proliferation and loss of neurons at low concentrations while inducing necrosis of neurons and microglia at high concentrations, with its neurotoxicity being dependent on its aggregation activity [18]. Importantly, tau oligomer formation at the early stage of aggregation may contribute to the neuropathological effect [5–7,19]. In this study, the 2N4R isoform of tau was selected to test small molecules with a special emphasis on anti-oligomer activity that could potentially be optimized and validated with tau animal model for proof of concept. Through the use of spectrometric and biophysical assays such as ThT fluorescence analysis, photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) assay, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), three interesting amide compounds emerged, one of which resulted in a reduction of inclusion formation in M17D neuroblastoma cells that express inclusion-prone αSynuclein-3K::YFP.

Materials and Methods

Chemistry.

All reagents and solvents were commercially available (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; Thermo Scientific (formerly Alfa Aesar), Waltham, MA; Matrix Scientific, Columbia, SC; Ambeed, Arlington Hts, IL). Reagents were used without further purification. The progress of all reactions was monitored using TLC on precoated silica gel plates with fluorescent indicator detectable at 254 nm from Sigma Aldrich. Organic solutions were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents was carried out on a Büchi rotavapor R-100 equipped with a Büchi V-100 vacuum controller. Proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. Proton chemical shifts are reported in ppm (TMS, ẟ 0.00) or with the solvent reference relative to TMS employed as the internal standard (CDCl3, ẟ 7.26; DMSO‑d6 ẟ 2.54). The multiplicities of NMR signals are designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (double doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), br (broad), m (multiplet, for unresolved lines). High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) of the compounds were carried out on Advion Mass Spectrometer (Advion Expression CMS) at the Analytical Mass Spectrometry Facility within the Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery. Uncorrected melting points (mp) were determined on a Barnstead Electrothermal Mel-Temp apparatus (Barnstead International, Dubuque, Iowa, USA). The physical chemical properties of each molecule were predicted using the following programs: SwissADME (TPSA, Log P, Log D), Blood-Brain Barrier Prediction Server (https://www.cbligand.org/BBB/), and Chemaxon (pKa) (Table 1).

General procedure for the synthesis of indole carboxamides (1–17)

4-dimethylamino pyridine (1.1 eq) and N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (1 eq) was added slowly to a stirred solution of appropriate carboxylic acid (1 eq) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (4 mL) at 0°C. The reaction was then allowed to stir for 45 minutes at 0°C. After this, 4- or 5-aminoindole (1.1 eq) was added and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. On completion, an aqueous solution of 1N hydrochloric acid (7 mL) and EtOAc (10 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and extracted. The organic layers were then washed with saturated solutions of ammonium chloride (7 mL), sodium bicarbonate (7 mL), and brine (7 mL), respectively. Organic layers were collected, filtered over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and dried in-vacuo to obtain the desired products with moderate to good yields.

Biophysical and cellular assessment

Expression and purification of recombinant human α-syn and tau

α-Syn was purchased from rPeptide, LLC (Watkinsville, GA) (results presented in Table 1 and Figs. 3, 5–7). Recombinant α-syn was produced for validation of Table 1 and utilized in results presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Human WT aSYN and human tau 2N4R were purified from BL21 DE3 E. coli cells. The cells were transformed with the plasmid pT7–7-wt-aSyn [20] or pRK172–2N4R (kindly provided by Dr. David Eliezer, Weill Cornell Medicine), and grown in LB media supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37°C, and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6,000 g for 15 min at 4°C.

Freshly made α-syn lots were used for evaluation of oligomer formation by western blot. aSyn-expressing cells were resuspended in aSyn lysis buffer (10 mM Tris·HCL, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme, pH 8.0), and a lysate prepared from the cells using a French pressure cell press was supplemented with streptomycin sulfate to precipitate DNA, followed by ammonium sulfate to precipitate unwanted proteins via a salting out method. After boiling the supernatant for 20 min, heat-denatured protein were pelleted by centrifugation at 22,500 g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant containing aSyn was filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane and fractionated successively on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 size exclusion column, followed by a HiPrep Q HP 16/10 anion-exchange column (Cytiva). Proteins were eluted from the HP 16/10 column with a linear gradient ranging from 25 mM to 1 M NaCl. Tau 2N4R-expressing cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM MES, 400 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma Aldrich), 0.25 mg/mL lysozyme, and 1 μg/mL DNase I, pH 6.8) and lysed with a French pressure cell disruptor at 4°C, and the lysate was boiled for 20 min. Denatured proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was dialyzed overnight against cation exchange buffer (20 mM MES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM PMSF, pH 6.8). The dialysate was loaded onto a HiPrep SP HP column, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient ranging from 50 mM to 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing aSyn or tau isoform 2N4R (as determined via SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining) were pooled, and the resulting protein solution was dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) and stored at −80°C.

Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays

The ThT fluorescence assay is an established method used routinely to follow the kinetics of α-syn fibril formation with different drug candidate treatments [21,22]. We first tested compounds at a final concentration of 100 μM and prepared α-syn and 2N4R tau at 2 μM and 6 μM, respectively. Compounds with the highest anti-fibrillary activity were tested at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μM to obtain dose-response curves.

For the α-syn ThT assay, ThT was used at a final concentration of 20 μM. α-Syn was dissolved in 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 mM NaCl to a stock solution of 277.8 μM (1 mg/250 μL) prior to resuspension in ThT buffer to obtain a final concentration of 2 μM. Compounds and ThT were first added to the wells. The kinetics of fibril formation begin when the α-syn is solubilized in the ThT buffer (10 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4), supplemented with 0.5 mM SDS and 300 mM NaCl) and added to a non-treated black 96 well microplate with a transparent flat bottom. Each well was filled with a maximum volume of 150 μL buffer with one 3 mm borosilicate bead [23]. The background fluorescence signal consisted of ThT in buffer and 0.25% DMSO without α-syn. The excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 440 and 485 nm, respectively, with a Synergy HT multi-mode microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Measurements were taken at 37°C every 20 min over 50 h of shaking prior to reading the plate. Samples were measured in three replicates, and the experiments were repeated three times using different α-syn stock solutions. For each time point, the background fluorescence signal was subtracted. Arbitrary units of fluorescence were calculated from the mean values normalized against the maximum value in each completed assay. Arbitrarily, the maximum value (100%) for the fluorescence intensity was established for α-syn.

Concerning the tau (isoform 2N4R) kinetics of fibril formation, measurements of ThT fluorescence were performed with a solution of the protein diluted to a final concentration of 6 μM in PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 1.5 μM heparin, 20 μM ThT, 2.5 mM DTT, and 100 μM compound. Aliquots of the diluted protein solution (100 μL each) were pipetted into the wells of a 96-well plate, and a Teflon ball was added to each well. The plate was incubated at 37°C with constant shaking at 1,000 rpm in a Tecan Spark plate reader. ThT fluorescence was measured every 15 min with excitation and emission wavelengths of 440 nm and 480 nm, and the data were plotted using GraphPad Prism.

Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP).

To induce oligomerization by cross-linking, α-syn (from Rpeptide, LLC) and tau isoform 2N4R were diluted in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to reach a final concentration of 50 and 6 μM, respectively [22]. Different compounds were added to the protein solution at a final concentration of 50 μM. To confirm the gradual effect of our compounds on the inhibition of α-syn oligomerization, compounds were tested at final concentration of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μM. The controls consisted of samples without light exposition, without Ru(bpy), and without compound (i.e. 0.125% DMSO). The cross-linking reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μL of Ru(bpy) (300 μM final concentration) and 2 μL ammonium persulfate (6 mM final concentration). Samples were irradiated immediately. Light exposure was of a 1 s duration for α-syn and a 3 s duration for tau isoform 2N4R, with a 53 W (120 V) incandescent lamp installed in a homemade dark-box. Each tube contained a final volume of 20 μL. After irradiation, 8.3 μL of Laemmli loading buffer containing 15% β-mercaptoethanol was immediately added to the solution, followed by incubation at 95°C for 10 min. The cross-linked samples were separated on a 16% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomassie blue staining.

In order to validate the PICUP results, the uncrosslinked α-syn was incubated at a final concentration of 60 μM in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in the presence of vehicle (1.5% DMSO), the amide compounds of interest (compounds 2, 8, 17), and the weak anti-fibrillization inhibitor (compound 13). Compounds were tested at a final concentration of 600 μM (molar ratio 1:10). Samples were incubated for 24h and 48h with constant shaking at 300 rpm and 37°C (VWR Thermal Shake Touch, Troemner, LLC, Thorofare, NJ). At the end of the incubation, samples were mixed with one third volume of the above-mentioned loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis in a 16% SDS-PAGE gel. After transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the proteins were analyzed via Western blotting using previously published procedures [24,25] to detect oligomers and α-syn using a polyclonal anti-oligomer A11 (Invitrogen, Waltham, Massachusetts, cat. #AHB0052) and monoclonal anti-α-syn (Invitrogen, syn 211, cat. #32–8100), respectively. Nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to the monoclonal antibodies diluted at 1/1000 using a solution of 5% non-fat dried milk in TBS plus 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 12 h at 4°C. Peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies consisted of an anti-rabbit antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals, inc., Pottstown, PA, cat. #611–1322-0100) and an anti-mouse antibody (Rockland, cat. #610–1319-0100) at a dilution of 1/5000 in 5% non-fat dried milk with TBS-T for one hour at room temperature. The membranes were then exposed to a 1:1 ratio of enhanced chemiluminescent solution (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, cat. #32209) for one minute before the acquisition of images using a SynGene G;Box scanner (model Chemi XR 5) and the G:Box Chemi-XRQ GENESYS software.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

For the examination of ultrastructural changes, a solution of α-syn or tau isoform 2N4R (60 μM) supplemented with DMSO (1.5%) or 600 μM of compound was incubated in a 10 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4) for 24h at 37°C (molar ratio 1:10). Tau samples recovered at the end of kinetic analyses of fibril formation using ThT were also analyzed at similar molar ratio with 6 times less concentrated samples. For the preparation of grids prior to EM analysis, a volume of 10 μL of each sample was applied to a 400-mesh Formvar-carbon-coated copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). The grids were incubated for 1 min with the sample and then washed three times with distilled water. After being air-dried, a fresh solution of 1% uranyl acetate was applied for 1 min. Solution was absorbed with filter paper, and grids were air-dried. The grids were examined using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1400 Flash, Japan), and micrographs were captured using an accelerating voltage of 100 kV and magnification of 40 k.

α-Syn (or αS) inclusion-forming neuroblastoma cell experiment.

Dox-inducible neuroblastoma cells M17D-TR/ αS-3K::YFP were used according to the published experimental procedure [21,22,26]. For this cell-based assay, the cellular density consisted of 30,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate format. After 24h of seeding the plates, compounds were introduced at ranging concentrations of 5 to 40 μM for a period of 24h. After, the induction of the αS-3K::YFP transgene expression was initiated by adding dox (1 μg per mL, final concentration in culture media). Cells were incubated in the Incucyte Zoom 2000 platform (Essen Biosciences), where the acquisition of images (green, bright field) occurred continuously. After 48h of induction, inclusion formation and cell growth were assessed. To determine the levels of different proteins by Western blotting, α-syn monoclonal antibody 4B12 (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA; 1:1000) and GAPDH polyclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, G9545; 1:5000) were used.

Results and Discussion

In this work, a series of seventeen 4- or 5-aminoindole carboxamides (Scheme 1) were synthesized using various commercially available substituted aromatic carboxylic acids employing the acid-amine coupling protocol. Indole carboxamide derivatives 1–17 were synthesized starting from 4- or 5-aminoindoles and commercially available carboxylic acids using the acid-amino coupling protocol, employing 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. HCl (EDCI.HCl) and 4-(dimethylamino) pyridine in N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 0 – 25°C (Scheme 2). Compound 18 was prepared using the same procedure starting from 2-aminofluorene and 4-chlorobenzoic acid. All final compounds were obtained in moderate to good yields (49–76%) and characterized by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), and melting point (MP).

For each carboxamide compound, the physicochemical parameters were predicted using SwissADME, Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Prediction Server (https://www.cbligand.org/BBB/), and Chemaxon. The chemical structures and physicochemical parameters are indicated in Table 1. During the design of the molecules that target prone-to-aggregate neuropeptides, the physicochemical properties relevant to cross the BBB were considered. The favorable physicochemical properties for ideal molecules to cross the BBB consist of the following: a MW ≤ 397.9, a calculated partition coefficient (clogP) ranging from 1.7 and 3 (below ~2.8), and a topological polar surface area (TPSA) below 80–90 angstroms squared [27]. These physicochemical median values are based on the on the Pfizer study [27] which have evaluated 227 CNS drug candidates and set a Central Nervous System Multiparameter Optimization scoring (CNS MPO candidates). Among all the synthesized compounds, compounds 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 11, 15 and 17 have a calculated logP below 2.8. All amide derivatives display a MW inferior to 397.9 and a TPSA value of below 80–90 angstroms squared. On a scale of 6, the CNS MPO scores ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 are considered having potential to cross the BBB. Amide derivatives 2 to 4 and 7 to 17 exhibited a CNS MPO score withing this range. No compounds exhibited a higher score, which would have been considered more desirable.

ThT fluorescence assay using alpha-synuclein (α-syn) was employed as a means to identify the most potent anti-fibrillary compounds among the amide series. Compounds were tested at 100 μM with α-syn at 2μM. The complete kinetics of fibril formation for these compounds are presented in Fig. 1. The plateau phase of sigmoidal kinetics is of particular interest because it is the phase in which mature fibrils form and where aggregation and disaggregation are at equilibrium with each other; therefore, we can compare the fluorescence intensity between multiple compounds at the plateau phase in order to identify the compounds with the most promising anti-aggregation activity (Table 1, column α-syn ThT %). This initial ThT fluorescence assay identified compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as the most potent anti-fibrillary compounds, where fibrillation was reduced to 30% or less compared to the control condition (Table 1). Compound 17 was the best representative of the 5-aminoindole series and moved to the tier-2 assays, even though the resulting ThT percentage of fluorescence intensity was 10% higher than the 30% cut off referred to above. These compounds were then selected to be tested on tau 2N4R ThT fluorescence assays.

In terms of structure-activity relationships, compound 18 was prepared to link our prior anti-aggregation chemistry work with the 2-aminofluorene substituent [21,28]. However, the aminoindole substituent has been identified as an interesting molecular component of urea derivatives to inhibit the α-syn oligomer and fibril formation [22]. This work aimed to compare compound 18 with a series of 4- or 5-aminoindole carboxamides. Based on the results obtained (Table 1), compound 18, which bears a 2-aminofluorene coupled with p-chlorobenzoic acid, resulted in a ThT fluorescence intensity of 69.4%, confirming the relative efficacy of the aminoindoles (as seen when comparing the related compounds 4 and 12) in abrogating α-syn fibril formation. The 4-aminoindole carboxamides (compounds 1 to 8) were more efficacious compared to 5-aminoindole carboxamides (compounds 9 to 17). In the case of 5-aminoindole carboxamides, the anti-fibrillary activities were lower, with ThT fluorescence intensities ranging between 40 and 102%, with compounds 9 (40.5%) and 17 (44.1%) being the best 5-aminoindole representative.

Among the 4-aminoindole derivatives, compound 2 (27.3%) which bears an unsubstituted phenyl ring was more efficacious than compound 1 (50.9%) harboring a heteroaromatic ring (thiophene). The thiophene group is known as an isostere of phenol, and this may indicate that the phenyl ring with a substituted electron donating group such as a hydroxyl results in weak anti-aggregation activities. When the methoxy is introduced on the aromatic right at the meta position, the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity increases as seen in compound 3 (40.5%) when compared to unsubstituted carboxylic acids (compound 2, 27.3%). The Hammett equation classifies a methoxy substituent at the meta position as an electron-withdrawing group [29–31]. Substitutions with a more diverse selection of electron-withdrawing groups such as p-chloro (compound 4; 22%), o-chloro (compound 5; 19.5%), p-trifluoromethyl (compound 6; 26.7%), cyano (compound 7; 22.9%), and p-fluoro (compound 8; 22.2%) confirmed the importance of such electronic modifications in order to observe an anti-fibrillary activity with α-syn.

The kinetic solubility of most important compounds was performed at the MSU Medicinal Chemistry Core facility (Table 2). Two best compounds (2 and 8) and one weak inhibitor (negative control, compound 13) of α-syn fibrillization demonstrate solubility at higher concentration (300 μM) compared to the concentration used in ThT assay (100 μM) in the same buffer. From this result, it is inferred that the anti-fibrillization effect observed with compounds 2 and 8 is independent of the solubility.

A major goal of our study was to investigate the inhibitory potential of the best amide representatives on tau isoform 2N4R fibril formation and to examine which derivatives exhibit a robust cytoprotective (and/or anti-inclusion) effect with cell-based assays. Various structural analogs were first tested at a final concentration of 100 μM. We pre-selected compounds 2, 4–8, and 17 with the α-syn ThT assay prior to evaluation on tau isoform 2N4R. Pre-selection with α-syn was made of compounds suspected to be general inhibitors of aggregation in order to reduce number of compounds tested on tau. The kinetic aggregation curves resulting from the ThT experiment are shown in Fig. 2. Representative of the 4-aminoindole series, compounds 4, 5, 7, and 8 resulted in good inhibitory effect, with compounds 2 and 6 exhibiting a weaker anti-fibrillization effect. Interestingly, the 5-aminoindole representative, compound 17, was the best inhibitor of tau isoform 2N4R fibril formation. Compound 13 increased the fluorescence intensity, i.e. fibrillization, and was used as a negative control for most of the tier-2 assays.

One critical end point used to validate drug candidates targeting protein misfolding and self-assembly is evidence of inhibition of oligomer formation. We utilized the photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) assay to investigate α-syn (Fig. 3A) and tau isoform 2N4R (Fig. 3B) oligomerization in the presence of eight amide compounds (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, and 17). After being subjected to short light exposure, α-syn and tau formed cross-linked, high molecular weight species that were resolved via SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining (lane 3, Fig. 3A and B). Compounds 2, 8, and 17 effectively prevented this crosslinking for both α-syn and tau isoform 2N4R oligomerization. Compound 13 was used as a negative control for the α-syn PICUP. However, the compound resulting in the strongest oligomer band (i.e. compound 6) was selected as a negative control for the tau PICUP, and the incubation of 2N4R with this compound under PICUP assay conditions resulted in the appearance of high molecular bands representing the oligomeric species (consistent with a lack of anti-oligomerization activity). Our prototypes, compounds 2, 8, and 17, proved to be potent inhibitors of α-syn and tau aggregation by reducing not only fibrillization, but also oligomerization.

One limitation of the PICUP assay is the generation of free radicals which can be quenched by aromatic compounds, resulting in false positives when using the assay to characterize aromatic drug candidate. For this reason, results obtained by PICUP were validated using uncross-linked α-syn (Fig. 4). Freshly made α-syn lots were used for evaluation of oligomer formation by western blot. Protein samples (60 μM) incubated at 37°C for 24 h with different compounds (600 μM) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots generated using a polyclonal anti-oligomer antibody (A11) and a monoclonal anti-α-syn antibody were assessed to detect high molecular weight oligomers and monomeric α-syn, respectively. The anti-oligomeric effects of the 4-aminoindole carboxamide derivatives 2 and 8 were confirmed by the presence of narrow-shaped and less intense bands in samples incubated with these compounds compared to controls. Compounds 13 (negative control) and 17 (anti-fibrillary compound) did not reduce the intensity of the bands representing the oligomeric species.

We tested the three lead compounds (2, 8, and 17) at lower molar ratios to analyze their effect on α-syn and tau aggregation kinetics and demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship between compound concentration and protein aggregation. Dose-response curves were assessed with all three compounds. Our data in Fig. 5 showed a correlation between the concentration of the three lead compounds (dose-response) and a reduction in fluorescence intensity. Both α-syn and tau isoform 2N4R exhibited a reduction in protein fibrillization when subjected to higher concentrations of the three lead compounds. Based on the α-syn curves using the log(agonist) vs. response variable slope (four parameter) in Prism, the inhibition of percentage of fluorescence at 50% is estimated at 12.9 μM for compound 2 and 11.6 μM for compound 8. PICUP assays were also performed with different concentrations for each lead compound. PICUP dose-response experiments (Fig. 6) further confirmed that compounds 2, 8, and 17 prevented α-syn oligomer formation in a dose-dependent manner.

To confirm that the reduction of ThT fluorescence observed with compounds 2 and 8 is due to a reduction in protein fibrillization rather than interference with ThT [32], we utilized transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of tau isoform 2N4R after a 50-hour incubation with these compounds to visualize direct changes in tau 2N4R fibril morphology (Fig. 7). Long fibrils were observed in samples of tau incubated for 50h with 0.25% DMSO. The two compounds exhibited a clear effect in reducing tau fibrillization at a molar ratio of ~1:16, compared to 6 μM of tau in 0.25% DMSO. A sample of tau 2N4R supplemented with compound 2 resulted in shorter and less defined fibrils. Treatment of tau with compound 8 resulted in the most drastic effect, leading to the formation of immature fibrils.

In order to evaluate the effects of compounds on inclusion formation and cell survival, we opted to examine M17D neuroblastoma cells that express an α-syn-derived αS3K::YFP fusion protein in a doxycycline (dox)-inducible fashion. The pathological effect of the familial PD-linked α-syn missense mutation E46K is amplified in a triple α-syn mutant with E35K + E46K + E61K (= αS3K), which results in round cytoplasmic α-syn-based inclusions in cultured cells. αS3K expression is responsible for cell stress/toxicity and delayed growth of neuroblastoma cells [26,33]. In the αS3K system, several sulfonamide [21], urea [22], and other [26] derivative compounds have been demonstrated to overcome both αS inclusion formation and αS-induced cytotoxicity. Therefore, we selected this assay to evaluate the effect of compound 13 as a weak to non-inhibitor of aggregation, and the three best anti-aggregation inhibitors, compounds 2, 8, and 17 (Fig. 8). Compound 8 reduced inclusion formation in M17D αS3K neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of 40 μM (Fig. 8A and C). None of these compounds exhibited a significant reduction of inclusions at lower concentrations. Only compound 8 exhibited a small degree of toxicity at 40 μM (Fig. 8B), below 50% which doesn’t not confirm the cytotoxic potential of this compound [34]. Moreover, cell-based assays are a poor predictor of animal toxicity [35]. Western blot analyses for total α-syn, normalized to calnexin (loading control), were performed to determine the compounds’ effects on α-syn protein levels due to degradation or non-specific effects on transgene expression. Compound 8 reduced α-syn levels at low concentration (5–10 μM) only.

Conclusions

In this work, seventeen aminoindole carboxamides were designed and synthesized in order to investigate their potential therapeutic effects on α-syn and tau isoform 2N4R oligomer and fibril formation. It was beneficial to perform the anti-aggregation studies on α-syn first as a pre-test to identify potential candidates to further evaluate their tau anti-fibrillization activities. The results obtained from the α-syn ThT fluorescence analysis demonstrated that the 4-aminoindole derivatives were more efficacious inhibitors of fibril formation in contrast to the 5-aminoindole derivatives. The PICUP assay allowed us to identify compounds 2, 8, and 17 as the best molecules for reducing oligomerization of α-syn. Importantly, these three aminoindole carboxamides reduced α-syn and tau isoform 2N4R oligomer formation at low micromolar concentration. Compounds 2 and 8 are both representative of the 4-aminoindole series, whereas compound 17 is representative of the 5-aminoindole series. Compound 17 harbors a free amine that would need further optimization to avoid structure alert (i.e. oxidation by cytochromes p450 (CYP) enzyme family and formation of toxic metabolites). All of the 3 compounds possess physicochemical properties favorable to cross the blood brain barrier. Moreover, compound 8 reduced α-syn inclusion body formation in the dox-inducible neuroblastoma cell line M17D-TR/αS3K::YFP at 40 μM. Based on the data obtained from this biological evaluation, compound 8 seems to be the most promising in preventing fibril formation, oligomerization, and intracellular inclusion formation.

The amide scaffold is of utmost interest in developing new anti-NFT therapies given its lack of cytotoxicity to various cell lines and the drug-like properties of compounds with this scaffold, including a high propensity to cross the BBB. Herein, we have reported the pre-selection of the best anti-aggregation compounds with α-syn and inhibition of tau isoform 2N4R oligomer and fibril formation using 4-aminoindole carboxamide derivative compounds. The goal of this study was to provide a chemical scaffold for future optimization to design more potent inhibitors of α-syn and tau oligomer formation. These amide derivatives could represent a new class of effective inhibitors of prone-to-aggregate proteins relevant for the development of new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. We aim to explore more structure-activity relationships related to our top amide compounds in future studies to greatly improve their anti-aggregation and cytoprotection activities.

Fig. 1. Kinetics of α-synuclein (α-syn) fibril formation: comparison of 18 carboxamide compounds and control (CTRL) monitored using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays. The compounds were tested at a final concentration of 100 μM in presence of α-syn at 2 μM. Control consisted of the vehicle, i.e. DMSO at 0.25% (v/v). The graphs show kinetic curves of fibril formation for the control condition (black), cases of effective inhibition (e.g. compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 17) and a case of ineffective inhibition (compound 10).

Compounds were tested at a final concentration of 100 μM in the presence of tau 2N4R at 6 μM. Molar ratio of protein:compound was ∼1:16. Compounds 4, 5, 7, 8, and 17 exhibited the most promising anti-fibrillary activity. CTRL, control (0.25% DMSO); BG, background fluorescence signal.

Fig. 3. Aminoindole carboxamide derivatives 2, 8, and 17 inhibit α-syn and tau isoform 2N4R oligomer formation in contrast to other representative compounds. (A) α-syn (50 μM) was cross-linked (PICUP assay) with different compounds at 50 μM (∼molar ratio, 1:1). (B) Tau isoform 2N4R (6 μM) was cross-linked (PICUP assay) with different compounds at 50 μM (∼molar ratio, 1:8). The monomeric form of each protein was observed across all conditions and in the presence of all compounds (labeled ‘1’). Coomassie blue-stained polyacrylamide gels showed high molecular weight α-syn or tau oligomers (labeled ‘2’) with control (0.125% DMSO, 3A and 3B: lane 3) as well as compounds 4–7, 13 (3A: lanes 5–8, 10) or compound 6 (3B: lane 7). Compounds 2, 8, and 17 stopped formation of α-syn and tau oligomers (uncross-linked) (3A: lanes, 4, 9, 11; 3B: lanes 4–6).

Fig. 5. Curves showing dose-dependent reduction of protein fibrillation by aminoindole carboxamide compounds. Incubations were carried out with α-synuclein (α-syn) at ∼83 h (A) and tau isoform 2N4R at 50 h (B) with varying concentrations of the three most efficacious compounds (2, 8, and 17) identified by the ThT fluorescence assay. For each concentration (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 μM), triplicate data were collected from five consecutive time points at the plateau phase. α-syn and tau were tested at 2 and 6 μM, respectively. For tau, the resulting molar ratios (protein: compound) consist of ∼1:0 (control DMSO), 1:0.5 (compound at 3.125 μM), 1:1 (compound at 6.25 μM), 1:2 (compound at 12.5 μM), 1:4 (compound at 25 μM), 1:8 (compound at 50 μM), and 1:16 (compound at 100 μM).

Fig. 6. Evidence of dose-dependent inhibitory activity of aminoindole carboxamides on α-syn oligomerization determined using the PICUP assay. The protein (50 μM) was incubated with compound 2 (A), compound 8 (B), or compound 17 (C) at 50 μM (molar ratio 1:1), 25 μM, 12.5 μM, 6.25 μM, and 3.125 μM. The inhibition of α-syn oligomerization by compounds 2, 8, 17 is dose dependent. Control consisted of DMSO (0.125%). The monomeric form of α-syn is indicated by #1, and oligomeric species are indicated by #2.

Tau isoform 2N4R (6 μM) was incubated with (A) DMSO (0.25%; ‘CTRL’), (B) compound 2 (100 μM), or (C) compound 8 (100 μM) for 50 h (i.e., in previously described experiments aimed at monitoring fibril formation by measuring ThT fluorescence) prior to TEM visualization (molar ratio 1:10). High magnifications (40K) show fewer fibrils in tau samples supplemented with compound 2 or 8 in comparison with DMSO control. Scale bars located at the lower-right corner are representative of 200 nm.
