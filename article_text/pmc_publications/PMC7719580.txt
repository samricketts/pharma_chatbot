Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia globally, and the number of individuals with AD diagnosis is expected to double by 2050. Numerous preclinical AD studies have shown that AD neuropathology accompanies alteration in learning and memory. However, less attention has been given to alterations in metabolism, sleep, and sensorimotor functional outcomes during AD pathogenesis. The objective of this study was to elucidate the extent to which metabolic activity, sleep-wake cycle, and sensorimotor function is impaired in APPSwDI/Nos2−/− (CVN-AD) transgenic mice. Female mice were used in this study because AD is more prevalent in women compared to men. We hypothesized that the presence of AD neuropathology in CVN-AD mice would accompany alterations in metabolic activity, sleep, and sensorimotor function. Our results showed that CVN-AD mice had significantly decreased energy expenditure compared to wild-type (WT) mice. An examination of associated functional outcome parameters showed that sleep activity was elevated during the awake (dark) cycle and as well as an overall decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity. An additional functional parameter, the nociceptive response to thermal stimuli, was also impaired in CVN-AD mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate CVN-AD mice exhibit alterations in functional parameters that resemble human-AD clinical progression.

1. Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia in the elderly and is estimated to cost the United States healthcare system 290 billion dollars annually [1]. AD neuropathology includes: extracellular beta-amyloid plaque deposition, accumulation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and the loss of synapses and neurons [2]. These pathological observations have been demonstrated and examined for decades; yet, the mechanisms that underlie their etiology remain unclear [2, 3]. Current AD therapies have proven ineffective in mitigating or halting the progression of AD pathology following diagnosis [4, 5]. The absence of an adequate therapy to treat AD progression will foreseeably burden the economies of many nations due to the continued increase in AD prevalence globally [2]. Therefore, an approach focused on developing therapies that halt AD progression in conjunction to therapies or strategies that improve the quality of life in individuals diagnosed with AD should be considered [1]. To accomplish this, neurological impairments and other facets of AD beyond the well described realm of memory loss in several animal models need to be elucidated.

Abundance of glial cell (microglia and astrocyte) activation and proliferation is a common feature seen in AD that is stimulated by the presence of neurotoxic beta-amyloid accumulation. Glial cell activation and beta-amyloid accumulation in AD have been shown in a number of preclinical studies to accompany memory loss [6-10]. On the other hand, functional outcomes such as sleep, metabolism and sensorimotor dysfunction are examined to a lesser extent in AD preclinical research compared to memory impairment. Human AD clinical studies have revealed disrupted glucose metabolism and excessive sleepiness as indices of AD pathogenesis that occur earlier than memory loss [11-14]. Moreover, human brain post-mortem studies have revealed that beta-amyloid deposition in sensory and motor cortical areas is seen earlier compared to other brain regions such as the hippocampus [15, 16]. Therefore, in this study we examined whether the presence of glial activation and beta-amyloid accumulation paralleled alterations in metabolism, sleep, and sensorimotor function in the CVN-AD transgenic mouse model.

The CVN-AD mouse is a bigenic mouse model of AD and expresses the human APPSwDI transgene on a mouse nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) knockout background [17, 18]. The absence of NOS2 in the APPSwDI mouse disrupts redox balance and shifts the pathology toward a more human AD-like phenotype [18, 19]. Although less widely used than other AD models such as the 3xTg and 5xFAD models [20-22], the CVN-AD model is unique because it exhibits human AD-like pathologies such as: 1) parenchymal and vascular beta-amyloid, 2) neuronal loss, 3) cognitive impairment, and 4) hyperphosphorylated tau independent of a human tau mutation [17, 23-25]. We hypothesized that the presence of AD neuropathology in CVN-AD mice would accompany alterations in metabolic activity, sleep, and sensorimotor function. We employed female mice because two-thirds of AD cases in America are women, and we sought address this disparity in our study [26]. Our results validate the presence of beta-amyloid deposition in 8-9 month-old CVN-AD mice as described previously [24]. Furthermore, we revealed that the presence of beta-amyloid accumulation elevated glial cell activation and proliferation in this mouse model. Our results demonstrate that CVN-AD mice revealed the clearly established AD neuropathology that are coincident with disruption of metabolic activity, sleep-wake cycle impairment, and diminished sensorimotor function. Taken together, our results elucidate other neurological impairments in a model of AD that may present beyond memory loss.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Animals

Wild-type (WT) mice were generated from C57BL/6J breeding pairs obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, ME, Catalog # 000664). Homozygous APPSwDI/mNos2−/− (CVN-AD) breeding pairs were obtained from Dr. Carol Colton in the Department of Neurology at Duke University Medical Center. CVN-AD mice display human AD-like pathology that includes: vascular and parenchymal amyloid deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau, and neuronal loss [17]. All mice were bred in West Virginia University Health Sciences Center vivarium facilities, and only female mice ages 8-9 months were used in this study. Mice were group housed in environmentally controlled conditions with a reverse light cycle (12:12 h light/dark cycle at 24 ± 1°C) and provided food and water ad libitum. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of West Virginia University.

2.2. Indirect Calorimetry and Sleep Assessment

Oxymax/Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) (Columbus instruments, Columbus, OH) was used to measure oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), energy expenditure/heat (kcal/hr), sleep profiles, and locomotor activity as described previously [27, 28] (see Figure 1). Briefly, mice were individually housed in 12:12 h light/dark cycle CLAMS chambers maintained at 24 ± 1°C and were given access to food and water ad libitum. All measurements used for analyses were taken after the mice were acclimatized for 15.6 h in their respective chambers; all data were recorded at 26 min intervals for 48 hours (i.e. one interval equals a 26 min period) following acclimatization. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was calculated as a ratio of VCO2 to VO2. The total body weight for each animal was entered into the CLAMS Oxymax software which normalizes VCO2 (mL/kg/hr), VO2 (mL/kg/hr), and RER to body weight. Locomotor activity during indirect calorimetric assessment was measured in the light and dark cycles. The sleep threshold was set to four epochs (totaling 40 s) of inactivity (zero movements) and a single sleep bout was defined as one 40 s period of no activity. All data was collected were analyzed for both light and dark cycle periods.

2.3. Behavioral testing

Behavioral tests were performed in a second cohort of mice as shown in Figure 1. All behavioral tests were performed in the light cycle.

2.3.1. Open field

Open field testing was used to evaluate passive locomotor activity as previously described [29, 30]. Locomotor activity was recorded using a 4x8 photobeam activity system by San Diego Instruments (San Diego, CA). At the start of the trial, each mouse was placed at the center of the box and received a 1 h session recorded over 5 min intervals. The dependent variables are the total horizontal movements (x, y direction) and vertical movements (z direction) over a 60 min period.

2.3.2. Accelerating rotarod (AR)

Accelerating rotarod test was used to evaluate evoked locomotor performance and coordination as previously described [31]. A textured plastic horizontal rod (3 cm in diameter) was mounted 14.5 cm above a pressure-sensitive base (Ugo Basile, Gemonio, Italy). For each trial, the mouse was placed on a moving rod that accelerates from 4 rpm to 44 rpm when the operator hits the start button. Acceleration is continued until the mouse fell onto the padded base or until 300 s elapsed. Latency to fall (s) onto the padded base was the dependent variable. All mice received 4 trials on the rotarod.

2.3.3. Hot plate (HP)

Hot plate test was used to assess nociception [31]. Mice were individually placed on a preheated 55°C hot plate (IITC Life Science, CA), inside an open-ended cylindrical Plexiglas tub with a diameter of 30 cm. The latency (s) to respond to thermal stimuli and the total number of nociceptive behaviors (jumps as well as hind limb-lick, flick or flexion) exhibited over a 30 s time frame were measured. To prevent tissue damage, mice were removed from the hot plate after 30 s regardless of their response.

2.4. Tissue collection and processing

Tissue collection and processing was performed as described previously [29]. Briefly, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and intracardially perfused with 25 mL of 0.9% saline followed by perfusion and fixation with 50 mL 4% chilled paraformaldehyde (PFA, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Perfused brains were removed from the skull and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4oC. Brains were rinsed in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and sequentially cryoprotected in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 h each. Sectioning was performed in the coronal plane at 35 μm on a sliding microtome.

2.5. Immunohistochemistry

A third cohort of mice was used for immunohistochemistry (see Figure 1). Sections were immunostained using standard free-floating bright field and fluorescent immunohistochemistry methods as previously described [29, 32]. Briefly, all bright field sections were blocked with 80 mL PBS, 10 mL of methanol (Fisher Scientific), and 10 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Fish Scientific) and incubated on a shaker (Model 55D, Reliable Scientific, Hernando, MS) for 15 min. Bright field and fluorescent sections were then washed 3 times and permeabilized for 30 min on a shaker with 1% Triton (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at room temperature, followed by a 2 h incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used with antibody identification number and working dilutions indicated in parentheses: Iba-1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; AB_2544912, (1:1000)), GFAP (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA; AB_2811722, (1:10,000)), and beta-amyloid (Cell Signaling Technology, MA; AB_ 2797642, (1:500)).

2.6. Image analyses

Sections were viewed on a Leica DM6B microscope (Leica Camera, Allendale, NJ) and images were captured using Leica LASX software (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). Regions of interest such as the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3) and somatosensory cortex were identified by referring to the Allen Institute Brain Atlas (http://mouse.brain-map.org). Analysis of Iba-1 and GFAP images was conducted in the somatosensory cortex (40X magnification) and in the hippocampus (i.e. CA1 and CA3 at 40X magnification). 3 fields from 3 sections per animal were collected for GFAP and Iba-1 quantification. All collected images were converted to an 8-bit image using the FIJI/Image J version 2.0 software. To count the cells of interest, we performed threshold analyses on the 8-bit images to remove background signal without removing the true signal, i.e. the cells of interest, in the image. Identical lower and upper limit threshold values were applied to all images. The thresholded signals, representing the cells of interest, were then analyzed using the analyze particle icon in FIJI. Results are reported as percent area.

2.7. Experimental design and statistical analysis

Experiments were executed to enhance rigor and avoid experimenter bias according to ARRIVE guidelines [33]. Female mice were used for all experiments because several studies have reported a higher incidence of women living with dementia and AD compared to men [34, 35]. However, future experiments will utilize both sexes to allow for sex comparisons between males and females. Behavior tests were conducted from least aversive (i.e. open field) to most aversive test (i.e. hot plate). The investigator was blinded to the treatment groups for all behavior tests and image analyses. See Figure 1 for experimental outline. Statistical analyses were conducted in GraphPad Prism 8.1 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) or R programming software (R core Team, 2019). Image analyses, sleep, and behavior data were analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test, repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons post hoc test. Indirect calorimetry data was analyzed using a functional data analysis (FDA) approach to determine significant differences between treatment groups over all time points. Briefly, we used the R software package fdANOVA to perform an FDA analysis of variance and reported the p-values based on the Fmax test statistic [36, 37]. Within each light or dark cycle period, we tested the genotype effect for each response by fitting linear mixed effects models to leverage the near linear trend within each light or dark cycle regime [38]. Sleep profile analyses were separated into light and dark cycle profiles and analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. All results are expressed as mean ± SEM and p-values &lt;0.05 is considered significant. An outlier test was performed for all datasets using the Grubbs test. All datasets that did not display a Gaussian distribution were subjected to a comparable non-parametric analysis. All p-values and n values are indicated in the figure legends.

3. Results

3.1. Cortex and hippocampus of CVN-AD mice are burdened with beta-amyloid plaque deposition, glial cell activation and proliferation

First, we validated the presence of brain parenchymal amyloid-beta deposition in the CVN-AD mouse model as described previously for 12 month old mice [24]. 8-9 month old CVN-AD mice exhibit severe beta-amyloid plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus compared to WT mice (Figure 2A). Yet, it was unclear whether the presence of beta-amyloid plaques at this age accompanies neuroinflammatory glial pathology. Therefore, we examined in our CVN-AD model the accumulation of beta-amyloid plaque deposition to well described neuroinflammatory attributes of AD such as microgliosis and astrogliosis [39]. Our results revealed that CVN-AD mice displayed significantly elevated cortical microglia and reactive astrocytes (microglia, p = 0.02; astrocytes, p = 0.03, Figure 2B) compared to age and sex matched WT mice. Likewise, microglia numbers in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3) of CVN-AD mice were significantly increased (microglia, p = 0.0043, Figure 2C) compared to WT mice, though, no significant differences in hippocampal astrocytes numbers were observed between CVN-AD and WT mice (Figure 2C). Furthermore, microglia conformation in the cortex and hippocampus (CA1 shown) of CVN-AD displayed an amoeboid morphology (i.e. activated microglia) compared to the ramified microglia morphology (i.e. surveillance microglia) seen in WT mice (Figure 2D). Likewise, astrocytic cell body hypertrophy and increased fiber-like processes (i.e. activated or reactive astrocytes) were observed in the cortex and hippocampus (CA1 shown) of CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice (Figure 2E). These results demonstrate that CVN-AD mice display severe amyloid-beta plaque deposition and neuroinflammatory characteristics such as microgliosis and astrogliosis. Taken together, these results validate the use of 8-9 months old female CVN-AD mice as a suitable model to investigate the coupling of AD neuropathology to disruptions in metabolic activity, sleep, and sensorimotor function.

3.2. Energy utilization and expenditure are diminished in CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice

Next, we examined whether the neuropathological findings shown in Figure 2 were coupled to alterations in metabolic activity. To do this, we performed indirect calorimetric assessments on a cohort of 8-9 months old female CVN-AD and WT mice over two light:dark cycle periods (see experimental design, Figure 1). Our results showed that CVN-AD mice displayed a significant decrease in oxygen consumption (VO2) in the light (sleep state, p = 0.0064) and dark (awake phase, p = 0.0014) cycles compared to WT mice (Figure 3A). Carbon dioxide production was also significantly decreased in CVN-AD mice for both the light (p = 0.0001) and dark (p = 0.001) cycles compared to WT mice (Figure 3B). RER was measured as a surrogate to demonstrate substrate, i.e. carbohydrate or lipid, utilization [40]. CVN-AD mice revealed a significantly decreased RER in the light cycle (p = 0.0001) compared to WT mice; however, RER was not significantly different between CVN-AD and WT mice in the dark cycle (Figure 3C). Furthermore, energy expenditure (heat) was examined in both groups. Our results showed that CVN-AD mice revealed a significant decrease in energy expenditure compared to WT mice in the light (p = 0.01) and dark (p = 0.0003) cycles (Figure 3D). These results demonstrate that CVN-AD mice exhibit significant alterations in functional metabolic parameters relative to age-matched WT mice.

3.3. Disrupted dark cycle sleep profiles are present in CVN-AD mice

Thereafter, we investigated whether CVN-AD mice displayed alterations in sleep. The sleep analysis was performed in the same cohort of mice that underwent metabolic assessment and data were collected simultaneously (see Figure 1). Our results showed that CVN-AD mice showed a trending increase in the percent of time sleeping time during the dark cycle compared to WT mice (p = 0.087, Figure 4A). Interestingly, CVN-AD mice had a significantly increased number of sleep bouts in the dark cycle (p = 0.01, Figure 4B). However, comparisons of average bout duration in the dark cycle between WT and CVN-AD mice were not significant (Figure 4B). Percent time sleeping (Figure 4A), number of sleeping bouts (Figure 4B), and average bout duration (Figure 4C) were not significantly different between CVN-AD and WT mice in the light cycle. To provide further evidence that CVN-AD spent more time sleeping in the dark cycle, we analyzed activity during the light and dark cycles at timepoints when the sleep data was collected. Our results showed that CVN-AD mice had a significantly decreased activity in the dark cycle (p = 0.02, Figure 4D), however, there were no significant differences in locomotor activity between CVN-AD and WT mice in the light cycle (Figure 4G). Collectively, these data show that sleep disruption is present in the awake phase (i.e. dark cycle) of CVN-AD mice.

3.4. AD neuropathology is coupled to sensorimotor dysfunction

Finally, we investigated whether CVN-AD mice displayed alterations in sensorimotor function using the open field, rotarod, and hot plate tests on a second cohort of mice (see Figure 1). CVN-AD mice displayed a significantly decreased spontaneous horizontal (p = 0.0009) and vertical (p = 0.006) movements when introduced to a novel environment over a 1 h time period compared to WT mice (Figure 5A, B). Evoked locomotion and coordination measured by the rotarod test revealed no differences between CVN-AD and WT mice over four trials (Figure 5C). Next, we used the hot plate test to examine sensorimotor deficits to thermal stimuli. Our results from the hot plate test revealed an increase (p = 0.06) in the latency to respond to nociceptive stimuli in CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice. Furthermore, CVN-AD mice displayed a significant decrease (p = 0.006) in the total number of nociceptive behaviors compared to WT mice (Figure 5D). From these data, we report novel findings of sensorimotor dysfunction in the CVN-AD mouse model.

4. Discussion

In the present study, we utilized female CVN-AD mice to demonstrate that metabolic activity is impaired in AD and parallels the progression of beta-amyloid and neuroinflammatory pathology. Female mice were used in these experiments because we thought it was important that our initial studies model the sex with the highest prevalence of AD [26]. It is not clear why females exhibit a higher AD prevalence compared to males. Some studies have suggested that the differences result from females living longer than males while others have proposed that an interaction between genetics and sex hormones may play a role in this increased prevalence; nevertheless, the role of sex in AD remains controversial [1].

Several AD studies have shown that beta-amyloid accumulation, microglia activation, microgliosis, and reactive astrocyte proliferation are archetypal AD neuropathology that often parallel AD associated memory impairment [7, 8, 41, 42]. Owing to this knowledge, we hypothesized that AD neuropathology in CVN-AD mice would equally alter functional outcomes such as metabolic activity, sleep, and sensorimotor function which are less described in AD preclinical studies. Furthermore, we aimed to elucidate a preclinical AD model that exemplified the neurological impairments present in early human AD clinical progression before memory loss becomes apparent [15, 43, 44].

Hypometabolism is well described in human and rodent AD studies; however, a majority of these studies assess metabolism in the context of the brain’s utilization of glucose [13, 14, 45-48]. In our study, we utilized a non-invasive approach to assess changes in metabolic activity. To our knowledge, we are not aware of any preclinical and clinical studies that have utilized this indirect calorimetric method to assess metabolic deficits in AD. RER was used to assess substrate utilization in CVN-AD and WT mice. A high RER (i.e. 1.0) indicates that carbohydrates are mostly utilized while a lower RER (i.e. 0.7) indicates lipid oxidation as a major source of energy [40]. Although the RER derived from aged WT and CVN-AD mice trended towards lipid oxidation as a major source of energy, it appears that CVN-AD mice significantly favored lipid oxidation relative to their WT counterparts in the light cycle. This finding is particularly important since lipid peroxidation (i.e. the oxidative degradation of lipids) is a risk factor for neurological impairment in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [49, 50].

Along with the RER findings, we observed that CVN-AD mice showed decreased VO2, VCO2, and energy expenditure compared to WT mice. These findings are similar to those seen in rodent studies investigating metabolic disorders [51-53]. Metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes have been implicated as a risk factor for development of AD [2]. Since we did not measure insulin levels in our mice, it is unclear whether the AD neuropathology promotes a state of hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance which could in turn alter metabolism. Although this has not been previously reported in the CVN-AD transgenic mouse, an insulin resistance phenotype is plausible since other AD transgenic mouse models such the Tg2576 and 3xTg mice have been shown to exhibit peripheral and central insulin resistance [54]. Alternatively, the alterations in metabolic outputs could also result from the chronic activation of microglia and astrocytes which in the long-term can become energetically costly and strain the brain’s energy budget for other processes such as synaptic plasticity and brain metabolism [55-57].

We also examined whether AD neuropathology in the CVN-AD mouse paralleled sleep disruption. Epidemiological studies reveal that 45 percent of patients with AD exhibit disruptive sleep patterns and it is clear from recent studies that these sleep alterations occur in the earliest stages of AD before cognitive impairment becomes apparent [11, 58, 59]. However, it is not clear whether these findings originate as a result of sleep deprivation which increases the risk of developing AD or via the degeneration of sleep neural pathways during AD progression [60, 61]. Our results showed that CVN-AD mice spent a greater percent time sleeping and exhibited an increased number of sleep bouts in the dark cycle (i.e. awake phase). The significant decrease in locomotor activity in CVN-AD mice furthers supports the notion that these mice were indeed asleep during the awake phase. Consistent with the findings from this study are reports from AD human patients which also demonstrated excessive sleeping during daytime hours [12, 62]. We speculate that the chronic activation of microglia and astrocytes in the brain may be responsible for the altered sleep patterns seen in CVN-AD mice. This speculation is warranted since sleep deprivation is known to promote microglia and astrocyte activation [63]. Conversely, neuroinflammatory attributes such as microglia and astrocyte activation have been shown to alter sleep [64-67].

An earlier study by Thal et al. showed that sensory associated areas of the neocortex exhibited increased beta-amyloid accumulation compared to memory associated brain regions such as the hippocampus [15, 16]. Yet, less attention is generally given to the importance of sensorimotor function in AD progression compared to learning and memory outcomes [15]. The open field test revealed decreased spontaneous locomotion while the accelerating rotarod, which tests for evoked locomotion and coordination, revealed no differences between CVN-AD and WT mice. These results are consistent with those seen in other AD animal studies showing decreased locomotion in the open field and no changes on rotarod [68-70]. Some studies have shown significant differences on the rotarod for other transgenic AD mouse models; however, these studies have typically utilized aged AD mice (12-16 months old) [69, 71-73]. The ensuing differences between the open field and rotarod tests in our study revealed that CVN-AD mice are less motivated to explore a novel environment. Conversely, when the mice are motivated to participate in a motor test, i.e. they are motivated to stay on the accelerating rotarod rather than falling off, they perform similar to WT mice. In addition to the locomotor deficits, the hot plate test revealed novel findings of increased latency to respond to nociceptive stimuli and decreased number of nociceptive behaviors exhibited in CVN-AD mice. While there is a paucity of data on pain threshold during AD progression, dysfunction of the somatosensory cortex has been recognized in human and rodent AD sensory studies [74-79]. Studies utilizing the CVN-AD mouse model have demonstrated that learning and memory deficits become apparent at 12 months of age [17, 80]. We did not perform memory tests in our mice at 8-9 months old; however, the rotarod test can be used as an index of motor learning over four trials [81]. Our results suggest that CVN-AD mice were able to learn the motor task similar to WT mice over the span of four trials. Therefore, it is plausible that the age group used in this study better exemplifies preclinical AD progression.

In summary, this study has identified a novel and translationally relevant AD-like phenotype in the CVN-AD mouse which mimics the disruption of metabolic activity and disordered sleep seen in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Furthermore, we reveal a novel sensorimotor phenotype discussed to a lesser extent in preclinical AD studies. Our results demonstrate that these behavioral outcomes may represent a crucial component of an AD-like phenotype in transgenic AD mouse models. Delineating the underlying mechanisms would not only improve our understanding of AD pathogenesis and progression but would also improve the quality of life in individuals living with AD. Some limitations of this study include: the evaluation of indirect metabolic outputs and the absence of vaginal cytology examination since female mice were utilized. Nevertheless, the non-invasive approach described here illustrates methods through which AD preclinical studies can investigate additional relevant functional outcomes in conjunction with learning and memory assessments.

(D) CVN-AD mice microglia displayed an amoeboid morphology with shorter processes (i.e. activated microglia) compared to WT mice microglia which displayed longer ramified processes (i.e. surveillance microglia) in the cortex and hippocampus (CA1 shown). (E) Cortical and hippocampal (CA1 shown) astrocytes of CVN-AD mice displayed intense GFAP staining, cell body hypertrophy (red arrow), and increased fiber-like processes (yellow arrows) compared to WT mice. Data represented as mean ± SEM; n = 3/group; *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01. Scale bar in (A) = 75 μm, (B, C) = 25 μm, and (D, E) = 75 μm. Images were taken at (A) 5X and 20X magnification and (B, C) 40X magnification. Magnified images in (D, E) were derived from images taken at 40X magnification in (B, C).

Fig. 3. Energy utilization and expenditure is altered in CVN-AD mice.

(A, B) VO2 (light cycle (white horizontal bars): p = 0.0064; dark cycle (black horizontal bars): p = 0.001) and VCO2 (light cycle: p = 0.0001; dark cycle: p = 0.001) are significantly decreased in CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice. (C) Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was decreased in the light cycle (p = 0.0001) of CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice. However, no significant differences in RER were seen between CVN-AD and WT mice in the dark cycle. (D) CVN-AD mice revealed a significant decrease in energy expenditure in the light (p = 0.01) and dark (p = 0.0003) cycles compared to WT mice. Data was analyzed using the FDA analysis of variance and p-values were based on the Fmax test statistic; n = 5 (WT) and n = 14 (CVN-AD). 1 interval = a 26 min period.

Fig. 4. Sleep is disrupted in the CVN-AD mice.

(A) There was no significant difference in percent time spent sleeping between CVN-AD and WT mice in the light cycle (sleep phase). However, in the dark cycle (awake phase) CVN-AD mice spent an increased percent time sleeping compared to WT mice, though, this was not statically significant (p = 0.087, Student’s unpaired t-test). (B) Number of sleep bouts in the light cycle was not significantly different between CVN-AD and WT mice. However, in the dark cycle CVN-AD mice had a significantly increased (p = 0.01, Student’s unpaired t-test) number of sleep bouts compared to WT mice. (C) No significant differences in average bout duration were observed in the light and dark cycles between CVN-AD and WT mice. (D) Analysis for activity during the sleep test revealed that CVN-AD mice had a significantly decreased activity (p = 0.02) in the dark cycle (white horizontal bars) compared to the WT mice. No significant differences in locomotor activity were seen in the light cycle (black horizontal bars) between CVN-AD and WT mice. Data in (A-C) represented as mean ± SEM. Data in (D) was analyzed using the FDA analysis of variance and p-values were based on the Fmax test statistic; n = 5 (WT) and n = 13-14 (CVN-AD); *p &lt; 0.05. 1 interval = a 26 min period.

Fig. 5. CVN-AD mice exhibit sensorimotor deficits.

(A, B) Open field testing revealed a significant decrease in spontaneous horizontal (p = 0.0009, repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) and vertical (p = 0.006, repeated measures two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)) movements in the CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice. (C) Evoked locomotion was not significantly different between CVN-AD and WT mice on the rotarod test over 4 trials. (D) CVN-AD mice displayed an increased latency to respond to nociceptive stimuli compared to WT mice, however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.06, Student’s unpaired t-test). Furthermore, the total number of nociceptive behavior was significantly decreased (p = 0.006, Student’s unpaired t-test) in the CVN-AD mice compared to WT mice. Data represented as means ± SEM; n = 6 (WT), n = 8 (CVN-AD); *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001.
