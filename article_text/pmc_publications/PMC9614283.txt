Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) hydrolyzes cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) leading to increased levels of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a transcriptional factor involved with learning and memory processes. We previously reported potent quinoline-based PDE5 inhibitors (PDE5Is) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the low aqueous solubility rendered them undesirable drug candidates. Here we report a series of novel PDE5Is with two new scaffolds, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,6]naphthyridine and 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one. Among them, compound 6c, 2-acetyl-10-((3-chloro-4-methoxybenzyl)amino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,6]naphthyridine-8-carbonitrile, the most potent compound, has an excellent in vitro IC50 (0.056 nM) and improved aqueous solubility as well as good efficacy in a mouse model of AD. Furthermore, we are proposing two plausible binding modes obtained through in silico docking, which provide insights into the structural basis of the activity of the two series of compounds reported herein.

Graphical Abstract


pmcINTRODUCTION

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. AD is a neurodegenerative disorder that compromises the ability of thinking, memory, and behavior. Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, composed of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide and microtubule binding protein tau, respectively, are the two main pathological hallmarks of AD. To date, no effective therapies have been developed for AD and only symptomatic treatments are available.1,2 Therefore, major efforts are ongoing to find better ways to prevent the progression of this disease. Several biological pathways have been considered for developing valid therapeutic approaches, such as Aβ-targeted strategies, tau-based therapies, oxidative stress reduction, anti-inflammatory drugs, and therapies targeting second messenger systems that are impaired by either Aβ or tau.1,2 However, drugs that entered the clinical trials, e.g., most recently solanezumab, bapineuzumab, and aducanumab, which are humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, have failed to improve clinical outcomes in patients or shown to induce adverse effects, e.g., vasogenic edema, making the Aβ-removing therapy a doubtful strategy to pursue for the treatment of AD.3–5

Here we have focused our attention on therapies targeting the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway because of its relevance to learning and memory processes.6 Specifically, NO stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), resulting in increased levels of second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which is important for promoting the phosphorylation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) at its Ser133.7,8 Phosphorylation of the CREB has been recognized as a crucial event for gene transcription during synaptic plasticity, which is one of the fundamental processes underlying learning and memory.9–11 Targeting the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway can be achieved through the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs are a superfamily of enzymes consisting of 11 subfamilies (PDE1–11) that hydrolyze the two nucleotides cGMP and cAMP into their inactive forms. One fundamental distinction between the subfamilies is based on their different affinity for the two substrates. PDE5, 6, and 9 are cGMP-specific enzymes, PDE4, 7, and 8 are cAMP-specific enzymes, while the remaining enzymes are dual-substrate PDEs, having affinity for both cyclic nucleotides.12 This superfamily of enzymes have been studied as targets for the treatment of various diseases, including erectile dysfunction, pulmonary arterial hypertension, cancer, schizophrenia, and AD.12–15

Over the past years, we have been interested in elucidating the involvement of the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB signaling pathway in AD;16 we have demonstrated that the inhibition of PDE5, which specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of cGMP therefore reducing PKG activity, leads to an improvement of learning and memory in mouse models of AD.6,17,18 Previous research in our laboratories led to a novel series of quinoline inhibitors of PDE5 (PDE5Is) represented by compound 1 (Figure 1). Compound 1 is a potent and selective PDE5 inhibitor as determined by an in vitro enzymatic assay [IC50 (PDE5) = 0.270 nM, IC50 (PDE6) = 0.339 μM]. When dosed at 3 mg/kg, an elevation of cGMP in the hippocampus of mice was observed. Moreover, compound 1 rescues learning and memory as shown by a pharmacological treatment of two different AD mouse models.18 However, a turbidimetric (kinetic) solubility screening revealed that compound 1 has a low water solubility (Table 2). This poor physicochemical property precluded the advancement of 1 into additional preclinical studies.

In the course of our drug discovery program, we have also discovered other classes of heterocyclic PDE5Is, derived from compound 1 and represented by scaffolds A and B (Figure 1). The two scaffolds were designed by locking the rotatable bonds of the hydroxymethyl group of compound 1 into a ring. By rigidifying the conformation of the parent compound, we sought to improve the potency and selectivity of the new molecules. We then decided to investigate these new chemical entities with the aim to find a suitable lead compound. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,6]naphthyridine (scaffold A) and 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one (scaffold B) ligands and their enzymatic activity. Notably, we could identify a PDE5 inhibitor, compound 6c, that displays enhanced potency, retained selectivity, and improved water solubility with respect to compound 1, as well as in vivo pharmacological efficacy in the APP/PS1 double transgenic mice19 that manifest aberrant accumulation of human Aβ driven by mutations in APP695K670N/M671L and PS1M146L. Additionally, we identified two plausible binding modes in the same pocket using in silico docking, which provides insights into the structural basis of the activity of the new series of compounds reported here. The validation of one of these binding modes as well as its usage for further optimization of the herein reported compounds via a structure-based approach are to be pursued in a following study.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Chemistry.

As the first step, we targeted the synthesis of a set of tricyclic analogues 6a–g (Scheme 1), 10 (Scheme 2), and 13a–d (Scheme 3). As show in Scheme 1, 2-amino-5-cyanobenzoic acid 4 was prepared via the cyanation of methyl bromobenzoate 2 with copper cyanide20 followed by hydrolysis under basic conditions of ester 3. For the synthesis of the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,6]naphthyridine core, a condensation reaction was used to synthesize intermediates 5a–d.21 Specifically, the reaction of 4 with the appropriate N-substituted piperidin-4-one in POCl3 gave 5a–d in moderate yields (21–55%). Then, 3-chloro-4-methoxibenzylamine was introduced on the tricyclic ring of 5a–c via nucleophilic substitution to obtain the final compounds 6a–c. Similarly, compounds 6d–f were obtained by using the corresponding commercially available benzylamines (see Experimental Section for details). For the synthesis of compound 6g, (3-chloro-5-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl) methanamine hydrochloride (10) was prepared starting from the benzaldehyde 7, which was initially reduced into benzyl alcohol 8 via a reduction reaction using NaBH4. Subsequently, benzylamine 10 was obtained by following the Gabriel synthesis procedure (Scheme 1). The synthetic route followed to prepare compound 14 was slightly different than the one used for synthesizing 6a–g (Scheme 2). Intermediate 5d was first dealkylated by using α-chloroethyl chloroformate (ACE-Cl); subsequently, after protecting the aliphatic nitrogen of 11 with a Boc group, the synthesis of 13 was accomplished via the same nucleophilic substitution reaction conditions used for compounds 6a–g. Finally, removal of the Boc group gave the desired analogue 14.

We also sought to introduce other functionalities at the naphthyridine 8-position. In the course of this effort, analogues 17a–d were synthesized using the same synthetic route of 6a–g but starting from commercially available materials 15a–c, as shown in Scheme 3.

Of note, during the chemical characterization of the naphthyridine-based compounds by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, the appearance of extra peaks was observed for derivatives bearing the acetyl group at the naphthyridine 2-position. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of equilibrating rotamers, which were confirmed by using additional spectroscopic techniques.22 1D NOESY experiments allowed us to identify the protons undergoing chemical exchange and to give a clear interpretation of the NMR spectra. A detailed description of the spectroscopic profile of compounds 5c (Figure S1 and S2) and 6c (Figure S3 and S4) as representative spectra is reported in the Supporting Information. In addition, as already reported for our previous series of quinoline-based compounds,18 a spin–spin coupling between NH protons and their vicinal aliphatic CH2 protons was observed for most of the naphthyridine-based compounds and confirmed by D2O exchange. The presence of clear split signals (doublets and triplets) was also depending on the solvent used to record the NMR experiment.

The general synthesis of 1H-pyrroloquinolinone analogues 24a–f is outlined in Scheme 4. Starting with 5-substituted 2-aminobenzoic acids 18a–c, 2H-benzo[d][1,3]oxazine-2,4(1H)-diones 19a–c were prepared from the reaction with triphosgene. Readily accessible isatoic anhydride 19d and 5-chloroisatoic anhydride 19e were utilized for the synthesis of intermediates 20d and 20e. Treatment of 19a–e with methyl acetoacetate yielded the desired methyl 4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate derivatives 20a–e, which were subjected to a chlorination reaction to obtain the 2-methylquinoline derivatives 21a–e. Next, bromination of the methyl group followed by cyclization with ethylamine in EtOH provided 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]quinolin-1-one derivatives 22a–f. The introduction of 3-chloro-4-methoxibenzylamine on the tricyclic template via nucleophilic substitution gave the final compounds 24a–f.

Inhibition of PDE5 and Selectivity versus PDE6.

Both naphthyridine (6a–g, 14, and 17a–d) and 1H-pyrroloquinolinone (24a–f) analogues were tested on human recombinant PDE5A1 in a fluorescent enzymatic assay performed by BPS Bioscience (Table 1). With respect to 1, both scaffolds A and B retained potent PDE5 activities. While compounds 6b, 6g, and 24c showed a potency comparable to that of compound 1, compounds 6c and 24a exhibited the highest inhibitory activity in the picomolar range. On the contrary, compounds 6d, 17a, and 24f displayed the lowest potency, which was still in the nanomolar range. The most potent PDE5Is 6c and 24a were also evaluated for selectivity versus the PDE6C isozyme, which shares a high similarity in the catalytic site with PDE5 with respect to the molecular binding and therefore represents a major obstacle in developing highly selective PDE5Is.23 Although both scaffolds were well tolerated, it appears that a larger aliphatic ring fused to the quinoline moiety contributes to increasing the PDE5 selectivity versus PDE6, as compound 6c bearing a 6-membered aliphatic ring showed to be ~500-fold more potent against PDE5, while the 5-membered fused ring in compound 24a leads to a selectivity for PDE5 of ~100-fold compared to PDE6.

Computational Study.

In order to better understand the structural basis of PDE5 inhibition by the new inhibitors reported here, we have conducted a computational study to identify a binding mode allowing to account for the experimental structure–activity relationship observed within the naphthyridine and the 1H-pyrroloquinolinone series (Figure 1, scaffold A and B, respectively).

First, we performed unconstrained in silico docking of compounds 6c and 24a, the most potent compounds of the naphthyridine and the 1H-pyrroloquinolinone series, respectively, into the putative cGMP pocket of PDE5A1 (see methods in Experimental Section). We targeted this pocket based on the fact that multiple complex crystal structures show that diverse PDE5 small molecule inhibitors consistently bind in it (e.g., pdb codes 1UHO, 3BJC, 3B2R, 3HDZ, 3SIE, 4G2W, 4G2Y, 4I9Z, 4OEW, and 4OEX), showing that it has highly druggable characteristics (Supporting Information, Figure S5A). The docking pose with the best docking score obtained for compound 6c (Figure 2A,B) and compound 24a (Supporting Information, Figure S7A) were very consistent (see Supporting Information, Figure S6A). Interestingly, a second binding mode, where the tricyclic ring is flipped compared to the best docking pose described above, was also consistently found for both compounds (Figure 2C and Supporting Information, Figure S7B). Of note, the two alternative binding poses occupy approximately the same space within the cGMP pocket for compounds 6c and 24a, as the tricyclic ring is rotated by ~180° around its central axis (Supporting Information, Figure S6C,D). Similarly to most PDE5 inhibitors, both compounds lack interaction with the structural Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions present in the enzymatic pocket.

In order to compare these two binding modes and potentially provide further validation for one of them, we explored whether they could account for the structure–activity relationship observed within the naphthyridine and the 1H-pyrroloquinolinone series. The interactions of compound 6c with PDE5 for both binding modes are summarized in Figure 3. Expectedly, the interactions of compound 24a with PDE5 are very similar for both binding modes (Supporting Information, Figure S7). Noticeably, these interactions can provide a qualitative explanation for some of the structure–activity relationships observed for the two series of compounds. For the best docking pose, in particular, the hydrogen bond between the nitrile group of compound 6c or 24a and the amide group of residue Q775, located at the deep end of the binding pocket, can explain the significant impact of chemical changes at this position on potency (compare compounds 6c and 17a–c for the naphthyridine series and compounds 24a–d and 24e for the 1H-pyrroloquinolinone series). Among the groups that can be compared for this position, the best potency is obtained with a nitrile group (IC50 ~ 0.6 nM for both compound 6c and 24a), while the weakest potency, within both series, is obtained in the absence of any acceptor (IC50 of 110 nM and 64 nM for compounds 17a and 24d, respectively). The presence of a weaker acceptor (e.g., F, Cl, or Br in compounds 24c, 24e, and 17c, respectively) and/or of a shorter linker between the acceptor and the tricyclic ring core (e.g., —OMe in compounds 17b and 24b, respectively), which places the acceptor further away from the Q775 donor, results in intermediate potencies (Table 1).

On the other side of the tricyclic ring, for the naphthyridine series, the water bridge formed between the acetyl group and M816 backbone in the best docking pose can also explain the reduced potency with groups lacking a good acceptor or donor (e.g., IC50 of 0.19 nM, 0.59 nM, and 1.55 nM with an ethyl group (compound 6b), methyl group (compound 6a), and hydrogen (compound 14), respectively) (Table 1). This role of the acetyl group in the naphthyridine series could, however, also be explained in the alternative docking pose, by the hydrogen bond formed with residue Q817. In the alternative binding mode, however, the importance of the nitrile group is more difficult to explain as it is mostly solvent exposed.

The two binding modes can also provide an explanation for the importance of the methoxy group in para- position of the benzyl ring of compound 6c (IC50 ~ 0.056 nM for a methoxy group in compound 6c compared to IC50 of 337, 57, and 1.5 nM for a trifluoromethyl, unsubstituted pyridine and a single fluoride in compounds 6d, 6e, and 6f, respectively). The benzyl ring carrying the group occupies the same small pocket lined by F786, F787, L804, I813, and M816 in both binding modes (Figure 2). When molecular dynamics simulations are preformed, water clustering and statistical thermodynamic analysis using WaterMap24,25 shows that, in the absence of a ligand, this small pocket is likely to be occupied by several “high-energy” water molecules (i.e., predicted by WaterMap to be significantly more energetically stable in the bulk solvent than in the binding pocket, where it, however, binds in order to avoid a vacuum) (Supporting Information, Figure S8). Overlapping of a ligand with one of these high-energy hydration sites by either a polar or a nonpolar group allows the simultaneous displacement of the unstable water into the bulk solvent while avoiding a vacuum and is energetically quite favorable. One of these high-energy hydration sites precisely overlaps with the position of the methoxy group for both docked binding modes of compound 6c (Supporting Information, Figure S8), while smaller groups like an unsubstituted pyridine or a fluoride (compounds 6e and 6f) would not be bulky enough to displace this water molecule to the solvent. For the case of the trifluoromethyl substituent (IC50 of 337 nM for compound 6d), the significantly reduced potency can be explained by the fact that, while it is certainly bulky enough to desolvate the pocket as well as the methoxy group, its significantly larger size does not sterically fit as well in the pocket.

Overall, these qualitative explanations globally argue rather in favor of the best docking pose relative to the alternative pose, although more work would be needed to further validate one of these poses.

Physicochemical Properties.

To determine the potential drug-likeness of compounds 6c and 24a, their in silico physicochemical properties were evaluated and compared to those of compound 1. As shown in Table 2, both compounds 6c and 24a obey the Lipinski’s rule of five and fulfill the restrictions of topological polar surface area (tPSA) for drugs targeting the central nervous system.26 Additionally, water solubility of compound 6c and 24a was assessed to establish whether the new scaffolds showed an increased solubility than compound 1. Kinetic solubility was measured in phosphate buffered saline following an 18-h incubation period according to the procedure described in the Experimental Section. Compound 24a was found to have a low kinetic solubility, while compound 6c showed an improved water solubility with respect to compound 1 (Table 2). The melting points of compounds 6c, 24a, and 1 have been reported in Table 2 as well. These findings suggest that compound 6c represents a good candidate for further analyses. We then engaged compound 6c in a set of experiments aimed at evaluating its pharmacological properties and potential use in AD.

Effects of Compound 6c on Hippocampal cGMP Levels and Synaptic Plasticity.

Based on its potency and selectivity profile, as well as its favorable aqueous solubility, compound 6c was moved into a functional assay aimed at evaluating its ability to increase the cGMP levels in the hippocampus of mice. Wild-type (WT) mice were treated with compound 6c at two different concentrations (3 and 10 mg/kg). Mice were subjected to foot shock and sacrificed 10, 60, and 180 s afterward (Figure 4). These time points were chosen based on previous experiments in which we observed a change in the cGMP levels immediately after foot shock.18 Increased levels of cGMP were observed at both concentrations and all of the 3 different time points. A dose-dependent increase of the cGMP levels was detected in hippocampi collected at 10 and 60 s after foot shock, with a 1.5- and 1.7-fold increase at 3 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, compared to untreated mice for both time points. At 180 s, a slight increase in the cGMP levels was detected in mice treated with 3 mg/kg of 6c, but it failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.097), while the higher dose produced a 1.3-fold increase of the cGMP levels with respect to vehicle-treated mice. A compensatory cellular mechanism leading to the hydrolysis of cGMP by other PDEs could explain the reduced increase of the cGMP levels at 180 s with respect to 60 s after foot shock for mice treated with 10 mg/kg of compound 6c. However, longer time points or the employment of inhibitors of other cGMP-hydrolyzing PDEs were not explored to verify this hypothesis. In any case, the NO signal transduction cascade, involving cGMP, is sufficient to phosphorylate the CREB that leads to memory formation through transcription of memory-related genes. Such a cellular response is triggered by memory-stimulating events, such as foot shock. Indeed, vehicle-treated mice subjected to foot shock (Figure 4, veh) showed an increase of the cGMP levels compared to vehicle-treated mice that did not receive foot shock (Figure 4, basal). Notably, compound 6c was effective in elevating the hippocampal cGMP levels, indirectly proving its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

To determine whether compound 6c was able to strengthen synaptic transmissions, we carried out electrophysiological experiments to measure the compound’s effects on the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a type of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and memory and to be impaired by the elevation of Aβ.16,27 Slices of the hippocampus were collected from 3 to 4 month old APP/PS1 transgenic mice and WT littermate controls and were treated either with vehicle or with 6c (50 nM through the bath perfusion for 10 min prior to the tetanus) (Figure 5A,B). According to our previous results, vehicle-treated APP/PS1 mice showed a reduction in LTP compared to that of the WT mice.28 Compound 6c rescued the defect in LTP; the residual potentiation recorded in slices from APP/PS1 mice treated with compound 6c (201.76% ± 14.09) was increased with respect to slices from APP/PS1 mice treated with vehicle (137.30% ± 10.83) (Figure 5A,B). Compound 6c did not have any effect on WT slices, consisting with the possibility that the inhibitor is acting on the LTP mechanisms underlying memory loss instead of a more generalized effect (Figure 5A,B). Thus, by acting on the NO/cGMP signaling pathway, compound 6c re-established the normal increase of synaptic strength in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice (Figure 5A,B). A similar beneficial effect was observed when compound 6c was injected in APP/PS1 mice from the age of 3–4 months for 3 weeks, and hippocampal slices were harvested at 6–7 months of age (Figure 5C,D). LTP was restored in compound-treated APP/PS1 mice (226.22% ± 6.71) compared to nontreated transgenic mice (164.11% ± 10.36) (Figure 5C,D), suggesting an enduring effect of 6c on potentiating synaptic plasticity. These results corroborate our previous findings on the prolonged beneficial effect induced by the PDE5 inhibition on synaptic and cognitive abnormalities in APP/PS1 mice that persists beyond the administration of the inhibitor.18,17

Plasma and Brain Levels and in Vitro Microsomal Stability of Compound 6c.

To further validate compound 6c as a promising candidate for treating a central nervous disease, a pharmacokinetic study was performed. We evaluated brain and plasma levels in mice after intraperitoneal (ip) administration of compound 6c at 25 mg/kg at different time points (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min). As shown in Table 3, peak plasma concentration of 6c occurred 0.25 h after dosing and its plasma half-life was 1.07 h. At 0.25 h, the concentration of 6c in the brain and plasma were 492.25 ng/g and 1571.44 ng/mL, respectively. The logBB value was used to evaluate BBB permeability; 6c showed the logBB values of −0.50, which was within the established threshold that defines a compound as crossing the BBB (logBB ≥ −1).29 Therefore, compound 6c demonstrated crossing the BBB.

Microsomal stability of compound 6c was measured in both mouse liver microsomes (MLM) and human liver microsomes (HLM) (Table 3). Such short half-lives were indicative of a rapid metabolism of the compound by both mouse and human microsomes. Optimizing the metabolic stability while maintaining potency is an effort to be pursued in a following study. The structural insights gained through the computational study presented above will be leveraged in this endeavor. The first possible metabolic liability to be further explored is the demethylation of the methoxy group on the benzyl ring of compound 6c. If this metabolic liability is confirmed (for example through microsomal stability profiling of compounds 6d, 6e, and 6f), the binding mode proposed for compound 6c will be used to guide the choice of an isostere to replace the methoxy group (i.e., bulky enough to desolvate the pocket while not too bulky to sterically fit well in it).

Behavioral Studies of Compound 6c.

Despite the fact that the analysis of microsomal stability suggested that further improvement is needed, we wanted to verify if the new scaffold (compound 6c) retained the capability of rescuing the memory loss in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. To this end, two memory tasks, fear conditioning (FC) and 2-day radial arm water maze (RAWM), were performed to assess associative and spatial memory, respectively (Figure 6). APP/PS1 mice were subjected to both tasks at the age of 3–4 months (Figure 6A,B), when they clearly show cognitive impairment.28,30 In these experiments, both APP/PS1 and WT mice were treated with 6c (3 mg/kg, ip) daily for 3 weeks and compared to vehicle-treated APP/PS1 and WT mice. The percentage of freezing in the FC task (Figure 6A) defines the animal response to an electric foot shock (see Experimental Section for detailed methods). Figure 6A shows that vehicle-treated transgenic mice froze less (~15% freezing) compared to vehicle- and compound-treated WT mice as well as compound-treated APP/PS1 mice, indicating the inability of these animals to associate the noxious stimulus with the environment where the stimulus occurs. Treatment with 6c, however, rescued contextual learning in APP/PS1 mice (~30% freezing) without affecting memory in WT mice (~30% freezing). In the 2-day RAMW (Figure 6B), the number of errors refers to the ability of the animal to reach the hidden platform, which is placed in one of the six arms of a maze (see Experimental Section for detailed methods). Compared to vehicle-treated APP/PS1 (~3 errors), compound-treated APP/PS1 showed a fewer number of errors (~1 error), suggesting that compound 6c is able to rescue spatial working memory. As expected, vehicle- and compound-treated WT mice performed well in the 2-day RAWM as they show no symptoms of memory impairment.

To investigate whether the beneficial effects of compound 6c on synaptic and cognitive abnormalities in APP/PS1 mice was persisting beyond its administration, both WT and APP/PS1 mice that were treated for 3 weeks with 6c at the age of 3 months were assessed for contextual and spatial memory when they were 6–7 months old (Figure 6C,D). In the contextual memory experiments, transgenic mice treated with the compound froze ~40% of the time compared to ~15% in vehicle-treated transgenic mice (Figure 6C) and made ~1 error in the 2-day RAWM test compared to ~2.5 in vehicle-treated transgenic mice (Figure 6D). Thus, synaptic and cognitive improvements persist beyond the administration of compound 6c. For all experiments, we performed cued conditioning and visible platform tasks to verify that contextual memory-independent mechanisms interfere with the interpretation of the results. None of these controls showed differences among various groups of mice (see Supporting Information, Figures S9 and S10).

CONCLUSION

We reported an extensive study of new chemical entities with PDE5 inhibitory activity. In particular, we reported the naphthyridine derivative 6c, which was found to have excellent PDE5 potency and selectivity, with improved water solubility with respect to the quinoline analogue 1.18 Despite its lack of in vitro metabolic stability, which suggests the need of further effort toward the optimization of this drug property, physicochemical and pharmacological properties of compound 6c were found to be optimal for a potential drug candidate.

Using in silico docking, we were furthermore able to identify two plausible binding modes and provide structural insights into the structure–activity relationship for the two series of compounds reported here. Further validation of one of these binding modes is work for a following study and should open the way to the structure-based optimization of the compounds reported here.

We further showed that treatment with compound 6c increased cGMP levels in the hippocampus of mice and improved learning and memory deficits in a mouse model of AD. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that the NO/cGMP/PKG/CREB molecular pathway plays an important role in learning and memory and that the inhibition of PDE5 represents a sound AD therapeutic approach for either slowing down or preventing the progress of the disease.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Chemistry. General Method.

All solvents and chemicals were reagent grade. Unless otherwise mentioned, all reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial vendors and used as received. Silica gel chromatography was performed using glass columns packed with silica gel (200–400 mesh, Aldrich Chemical). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent-NMR-vnmrs400 (400 and 100 MHz, respectively) spectrometer and were determined in chloroform-d, DMSO-d6, acetone-d6 or methanol-d4 with tetramethylsilane (TMS) (0.00 ppm) or solvent peaks as the internal reference.

PDE Enzymatic Activity.

Experiments were performed by BPS Bioscience, Inc. The enzymatic reactions were conducted at room temperature for 60 min in a 50 μL volume containing PDE assay buffer, 100 nM FAM-cGMP or FAM-cAMP substrate, 0.1–0.45 ng PDE5 or 22.5–250 ng PDE6, and the test compound. After the enzymatic reaction, 100 μL of a binding solution (1:100 dilution of the binding agent with the binding agent diluent) was added to each sample. After 60 min at room temperature, fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 528 nm using a Tecan Infinite M1000 microplate reader. PDE activity assays were performed in duplicate at each concentration. Fluorescence intensity was converted to fluorescence polarization using the Tecan Magellan6 software. The fluorescence polarization data were analyzed using the computer software, Graphpad Prism. The fluorescence polarization (FPt) in absence of the compound in each data set was defined as 100% activity. In the absence of PDE and the compound, the value of fluorescent polarization (FPb) in each data set was defined as 0% activity. The percent activity in the presence of the compound was calculated according to the following equation: % activity = (FP − FPb)/(FPt − FPb) × 100%, where FP = the fluorescence polarization in the presence of the compound. The values of % activity versus a series of compound concentrations were then plotted using nonlinear regression analysis of the Sigmoidal dose–response curve generated with the equation Y = B + (T − B)/1 + 10((logEC50−X)×Hill slope), where Y = percent activity, B = minimum percent activity, T = maximum percent activity, X = logarithm of compound, and Hill slope = slope factor or Hill coefficient. The IC50 value was determined by the concentration causing a half-maximal percent activity. Standard errors were calculated using the following equation SE=IC50(mean)−IC50(low)×SE(logIC50)logIC50(mean)−logIC50(low)

Computational Methods.

All calculations were performed using the Schrodinger molecular modeling suite (version 2016–2). The protein structure used for PDE5A1 was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (3TGG.pdb)31 and prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard.32 In this step, force field atom types and bond orders are assigned. Missing atoms are added, and tautomer/ionization states are assigned. Water orientations are sampled; Asn, Gln, and His residues are flipped to optimize the hydrogen bond network, and a constrained energy minimization is performed. The water molecules present in the crystal structures were conserved. Of note, only a few were present in the targeted binding site and were located at its periphery.

In silico Docking.

Compounds 6c and 24a were docked into the cGMP binding site of PDE5A1 using Glide.33,34 In both cases, the docking region (grid) was centered on the position of the crystal ligand (in 3TGG.pdb) that occupies the targeted region in the cGMP binding site. Default box sizes were used. Glide docks flexible ligands into a rigid receptor structure by sampling of the conformational, positional, and orientational degrees of freedom of the ligand. No constraint was used for the docking calculations. The poses obtained were further refined using minimization of the binding pocket around the docked ligands.

WaterMap Calculations.

WaterMap is a molecular dynamics-based method that predicts the locations and thermodynamic properties (entropy, enthalpy, and free energy) of explicit water molecules in a region of interest around a protein. The theoretical basis for the method as well as the specific computational algorithms used are fully described elsewhere.24,25 In brief, WaterMap clusters make the statistical analysis of the water molecules around the site of interest from many frames of a molecular dynamics simulation. Regions of high water density (high occupancy) are identified as “hydration sites”, and their corresponding enthalpies and entropies are computed relative to bulk solvent using the inhomogeneous solvation theory.35,36 In the work presented here, we ran WaterMap in the binding pocket in the absence of any ligand.

Kinetic Solubility Assay.

Experiments were performed by Cyprotex US, LLC. Serial dilutions of each compound were prepared in DMSO at 100× the final concentration. Test compound solutions were diluted 100-fold into buffer in a 96-well plate and mixed. After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, the presence of precipitate was then detected by turbidity (absorbance at 540 nm). Precipitate forms when maximum aqueous solubility levels were reached. An absorbance value greater than mean + 3× standard deviation of the blank (after subtracting the background) was indicative of turbidity. For brightly colored compounds, a visual inspection of the plate was performed to verify the solubility limit determined by UV absorbance. The solubility limit was reported as the highest experimental concentration with no evidence of turbidity. Reserpine and tamoxifen were used as a low-solubility control, and verapamil was used as a high-solubility control.

Microsomal Stability.

Experiments were performed by Absorption Systems. Human liver microsomes were purchased from XenoTech. The test compounds were added into the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 μM. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (without cofactor) was incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 °C for 3 min. The control compound, testosterone, was run simultaneously with the test compounds in a separate reaction. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a cofactor, and the mixture was then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 °C. Aliquots (100 μL) were withdrawn at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min for the test compound and 0, 10, 30, and 60 min for testosterone. Test compound and testosterone samples were immediately combined with 400 μL of ice-cold 50:50 acetonitrile/H2O-d containing 0.1% formic acid and the internal standard to terminate the reaction. The samples were then mixed and centrifuged to precipitate microsomal proteins. Samples for test compounds were analyzed by LC-HRAMS for the disappearance of the test compound and appearance of metabolites. All the remaining samples were assayed by LC-MS/MS using electrospray ionization. The peak area response ratio (PARR) to the internal standard was compared to the PARR at time 0 to determine the percent of test compound or positive control remaining at each time point. Half-lives were calculated using the GraphPad software, fitting to a single-phase exponential decay equation.

Pharmacokinetics.

Compound 6c was administered to mice ip at a dosage of 25 mg/kg. Blood and brain samples were collected at six time points (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 h) from three animals at each time point. For plasma measurements, blood (approximately 250 μL) was collected via retro-orbital puncture into tubes containing sodium heparin anticoagulant. Plasma was separated via centrifugation (4 °C, 3500 rpm, 10 min) and stored at −80 °C. At the time of measurement, frozen plasma samples were thawed at room temperature and vortexed thoroughly. Plasma (25 μL) was transferred into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. To each sample, 25 μL of methanol and 25 μL of the internal standard were added, followed by the addition of 100 μL of methanol. The sample mixture was vortexed for approximately 1 min. After centrifugation at 11 000 g for 5 min, the upper organic layer was transferred to a glass tube and evaporated at 40 °C under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Residues were dissolved in 150 μL of the mobile phase and mixed using a Vortex mixer. A 20 μL aliquot of the resulting solution was injected onto the liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) Shimadzu system for analysis. For measurement of brain concentrations, mice were killed by cervical dislocation after blood harvest. Brains were immediately excised, weighed, and rinsed by cold saline and then frozen at −80 °C until further processing for LC/MS analysis. On the day of the assay, frozen tissue samples were thawed unassisted at room temperature. When completely thawed, each tissue sample of 200 mg was weighed and placed into a plastic tube. Methanol (1.0 mL) was added, and homogenization was conducted using a pellet pestle cordless motor homogenizer for approximately 1 min. Then, the samples were vortexed for 1 min, and a 25 μL aliquot was transferred into an Eppendorf tube. To each sample, 25 μL of methanol was added, and the samples were centrifuged at 11 000 g for 5 min. A 20 μL aliquot of the supernatants was diluted to 60 μL with the mobile phase (H2O/acetonitrile with 5% formic acid), and a 10 μL aliquot was injected onto the LC/MS system for analysis. Quantification of the drug concentration in each aliquot was achieved by using the standard curve method. Half-life was calculated using the GraphPad software, fitting to a single-phase exponential decay equation.

Hippocampal cGMP Levels.

Male and female mice (2–3 months old; 20–25 g; C57Bl6 mice) were injected with 6c (3 mg/kg, 2% DMSO and 2% Tween, ip) or Vehicle (2% DMSO and 2% Tween, ip). Thirty min after administration of vehicle or 6c, mice were subjected to foot shock and sacrificed 10 s, 1, and 3 min after shock by cervical dislocation and decapitation. The hippocampal samples were extracted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Levels of cGMP were quantitated by the Enzyme Immunoassay procedure (Cayman Chemical Company, item no. 581021) following the manufacturer’s guidelines in duplicate. cGMP levels were normalized with the protein concentration calculated using BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Scientific).

Electrophysiology.

Hippocampal slices were cut as previously described.16 Briefly, 3–4 month old animals were sacrificed, and their hippocampi were extracted. Slices (400 μm) were obtained and maintained in an interface chamber continuously perfused with a solution (ACSF) consisting of (in mM) 124.0 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1.0 Na2HPO4, 25.0 NaHCO3, 2.0 CaCl2, 2.0 MgCl2, and 10.0 glucose, and the solution was bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Extracellular recordings were performed by stimulating the Schaeffer collateral fibers and recording in CA1 stratum radiatum with a glass electrode filled with ACSF. Following the recording of a 20 min baseline, LTP was evoked through a theta-burst stimulation (four pulses at 100 Hz, with the bursts repeated at 5 Hz and each tetanus including three 10-burst trains separated by 15 s).

Behavioral Studies.

Fear conditioning was assessed as previously described.28,30 Training for fear conditioning was performed by placing the mouse in a conditioning chamber for 2 min before the onset of a tone (conditioned stimulus (CS), 30 s, 85 dB sound at 2800 Hz). In the last 2 s of the CS, mice were given a 2 s, 0.7 mA mild foot shock (unconditioned stimulus, (US)) through the bars of the floor. After the US, the mice were left in the chamber for another 30 s. Freezing behavior, defined as the absence of movements except for respiratory excursions, was scored using Freezeview software (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Contextual fear learning was evaluated 24 h after training by measuring freezing responses for 5 min in the same chamber where the mice were trained. Cued fear learning was evaluated 24 h after contextual testing (Supporting Information, Figure S9). The mice were placed in a novel context for 2 min (pre-CS test), after which they were given a CS for 3 min (CS test), and freezing behavior was measured during the first 30 s that mimic the CS–US conditioning and the remaining 2.5 min.

The radial arm water maze task, a hybrid of the classic Morris Water Maze and the radial arm land maze, was performed as previously described.37 The mouse had to swim in 6 alleys (arms) radiating from a central area until it found a hidden (submerged) platform at the end of one of the arms, based on visual cues placed in the room. The first day of the protocol was a training day on which mice were trained to identify the platform location by alternating between a visible and a hidden platform in a goal arm. The final 3 trials on that day and all 15 trials on day 2 used a hidden escape platform to force mice to use spatial cues to identify the location of the goal arm. To avoid learning limitations imposed by exhausting practice and to avoid fatigue that may result from consecutive trials, spaced practice training was established by running the mice in cohorts of 4 and alternating different cohorts through the 15 training trials over 3-h testing periods each day. The number of incorrect arm entries (entries to arms with no platform) was counted.

If the animal entered the incorrect arm, it was gently pulled back to the start arm. Failure to select an arm after 15 s was counted as an error, and the mouse was returned to the start arm. Each trial lasted up to 1 min. After 1 min, if the platform had not been located, the mouse was guided gently through the water by placing a hand behind it to direct it toward the platform. The mouse rested on the platform for 15 s. The goal platform location was different for each mouse. On day 2, the same procedure was repeated as on day 1 for all 15 trials using only the hidden platform. For data analysis, averages for each mouse were calculated using blocks of 3 trials.

Behavioral testing also included control tasks. Specifically, evaluation of the visible platform task was performed to exclude motor, sensorial, and motivational defects. Speed and time (latency) to reach the platform was observed among the different groups of mice (Supporting Information, Figure S10).28

Statistical Analyses.

Experiments were performed in blind. Results were expressed as standard error of the mean (SEM). Level of significance was set for p &lt; 0.05. Results were analyzed by student t test/2-way ANOVA for repeated measures. Planned comparisons were used for post hoc analysis.

Animals.

The animal protocols for PK studies, measurement of hippocampal cGMP levels, and behavioral assessment were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The animals were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (with light onset at 6:00 a.m.) in temperature and humidity-controlled rooms of the Columbia University Animal Facility. Food and water were available ad libitum.

(B) Close-up view of the best docking pose for compound 6c. This pose is very similar to the best docking pose found for compound 24a (Supporting Information, Figure S6A). Note that for both compounds, postdocking minimization led to a significant change in the Q775 side chain orientation compared to the PDB structure used for docking (3TGG). The refined side chain orientation, which optimizes the geometry of the hydrogen bond with the nitrile group of the two compounds, is consistent with alternative side chain orientations observed for residue Q775 in other PDE5 crystal structures (Supporting Information, Figure S5B,C). (C) Close-up view of the alternative docking pose found for compound 6c. A very similar alternative docking pose was found for compound 24a (Supporting Information, Figure S7B). Dashed lines in parts B and C represent intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
