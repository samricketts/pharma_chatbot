Neurological diseases (NDs), featured by progressive dysfunctions of the nervous system, have become a growing burden for the aging populations. N-Deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 3 (NDST3) is known to catalyze deacetylation and N-sulfation on disaccharide substrates. Recently, NDST3 is identified as a novel deacetylase for tubulin, and its newly recognized role in modulating microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification provides fresh insights into ND therapeutic approaches using NDST3 as a target. Microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification have been reported to be critical for activities in neurons, implying that the regulators of these two biological processes, such as the previously known microtubule deacetylases, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), could play important roles in various NDs. Aberrant NDST3 expression or tubulin acetylation has been observed in an increasing number of NDs, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and Parkinson’s disease (PD), suggesting that NDST3 is a key player in the pathogenesis of NDs and may serve as a target for development of new treatment of NDs.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Neurological diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are becoming a major global burden to the society [1]. Dementia, disabilities, and even death are common outcomes of neurological impairment [2]. Thus, seeking efficient therapies to cure NDs is a public health priority around the world. However, the complicated pathogenesis poses challenges in understanding the underlying pathology and finding appropriate targets for treating these diseases. Protein quality control is critical for maintaining cellular function and is a key factor in NDs [3]. The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is one of the main pathways for protein degradation and quality control within cells. Dysfunction of the pathway leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and wastes and the induced proteotoxicity underlies the pathogenesis of various NDs [4]. Furthermore, the interruption of lysosomal activity causes deficits in the overall protein quality control [5]. In our recent study, the deacetylation of α-tubulin has been observed to exert regulatory effect on lysosomal activity by regulating the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) assembly [6]. This discovery sheds light on the understanding of the mechanism of NDs and potential therapies implicating the pathways of protein quality control and microtubule dynamics.

Microtubule dynamics describes the nature of microtubules which allows microtubules to change in length by reversibly converting between addition or subtraction of tubulin on each end to serve different functions in various biological activities [7]. Tubulin acetylation of α-subunits at K40 (hereinafter “microtubule acetylation”) is a vital regulatory factor of microtubule dynamics [8]. This post-translational modification (PTM) of microtubules is considered an important marker for microtubule stability. Tubulin acetylation provides cells resistance against mechanical stress, thus facilitating microtubule self-repair and support to help protect the overall structure of microtubules [8]. A stable and intact microtubule network is required for numerous neuronal functions, such as cell architecture, axonal transport, and dendritic growth [9]. Therefore, precise regulation of microtubule acetylation plays a critical role in neuronal functions and is frequently linked to anti-neurodegeneration targets [10,11].

The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is one of the most important cellular mechanisms for protein quality control. Among the components in the pathway, the lysosome is the central organelle for the enzymatic degradation of misfolded or malfunctioning proteins, damaged organelles, or other cellular wastes [12]. The lysosome contains over 60 different hydrolases. An appropriate acid environment is required for optimal hydrolase activities. The lysosomal lumen pH is maintained through active lysosomal acidification. The acidic environment is achieved by the action of several membrane ion channels, particularly the proton-pumping V-ATPase [13]. Consistent with the critical role of autophagic degradation in neurological disorders, lysosomal dysregulation has long been implicated in NDs [14]. Fluctuation in lysosomal pH would compromise the enzymatic activities of hydrolases, leading to the accumulation of a variety of waste products and the interruption of protein quality control, thus disrupting various neuronal functions. The commonly studied neurotoxic protein aggregation in neurodegenerative conditions, such as that of amyloid β-protein (﻿Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43, is an example of the consequences of abnormal lysosomal acidity. [14,15]

N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase 3 (NDST3) is recently identified as a novel regulator of lysosomal acidification via microtubule deacetylation [6]. NDST3 is a member of the NDST family responsible for the addition of bifunctional deacetylation and sulfation on disaccharides (Figure 1A) [16,17]. Surprisingly, our study uncovered an enzymatic activity of NDST3 on a protein substrate, α-tubulin, through which it acts as a classical histone deacetylase (HDAC) and catalyzes the deacetylation of α-tubulin at K40 (Figure 1B). This process regulates lysosomal acidification by affecting the assembly of the V-ATPase. Together with the two other previously known deacetylases for α-tubulin at K40, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), NDST3 constitutes the main regulatory machinery known to date for the reverse process of microtubule acetylation (Figure 1C). The pathway is responsible for balancing the level of acetylated microtubules to provide a functional microtubule network for cells in response to various cellular conditions. The discovery of the new role of NDST3 in microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification let us to propose that NDST3 could be a novel target for the treatment of NDs (Figure 2). In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the roles of NDST3 in various biological processes and its connections with NDs.

MICROTUBULE ACETYLATION AND NEURODEGENERATION

Microtubules are one of the fundamental cytoskeletons in cells. They form a long, hollow, straw-shaped structure that is dynamically assembled from ﻿α- and β- tubulin heterodimers. The dynamic addition and subtraction on each end of a microtubule allow it to reversibly switch between growth and shrinkage states. This feature of microtubules underlies their diverse cellular functions such as cell shaping, mitotic spindle building, organelle positioning, and intracellular vesicle trafficking [7]. The overall microtubule stability can be modulated in response to various conditions, such as stress and injury [18]. Stable and functional microtubules are critical to neuronal functions due to the need for long-distance signaling transduction [10]. Different types of regulatory mechanisms influence microtubule stability, including the PTM on the tubulin subunits, such as phosphorylation, polyamination, detyrosination, and acetylation [18]. Abnormal PTMs on microtubules put the microtubule network at the risk of dysfunction, which is often considered a significant pathogenic hallmark of neurodegeneration [19,20]. Among the PTMs, microtubule acetylation has been drawing particular attention because of its importance in fundamental cellular functions [21,22]. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of microtubule acetylation in maintaining the integrity and stability of microtubules [23]. Specifically, disorder of the microtubule flexible loop that contains tubulin K40 can be reduced by acetylation modification [23]. As a result, the modification increases the structural stability of the loop while maintaining microtubule flexibility, which in turn provides microtubules resistance to mechanical stress and breakage [23,24].

Failure in microtubule acetylation or deacetylation is one of the causes of neurodegeneration [8,22]. It is reported that lack of microtubule acetylation predisposes the tendency of the defect in neurons to the axon, such as over-branching and overgrowth, which results in impaired mechanical sensitivity and abnormal behaviors in animal models [22,25]. A decreased level of microtubule acetylation has been observed in various types of NDs. In a study investigating the microtubule acetylation in postmortem brain tissues of patients with AD pathologies, the cortical and hippocampal α-tubulin acetylated at K40 was significantly lower than that in the healthy control group [26]. Artificially elevating the level of microtubule acetylation promoted the clearance of Aβ deposition and tau aggregation, thus ameliorating the cognitive defects in AD models [27,28]. Similar effects of microtubule acetylation have also been found in HD, PD, schizophrenia, etc. [29] Intriguingly, excessive tubulin acetylation hyperstabilizes microtubules and triggers a series of neuronal abnormalities, such as fewer branches of axons and loss of synaptic varicosity [30]. The tubulin hyperacetylation was proposed to be involved in the pathological framework of some NDs [30].

NDST3 IS A NOVEL DEACETYLASE FOR α-TUBULIN

The control of microtubule acetylation is achieved via a reversible enzymatic process involving the forward reaction mediated by acetyltransferases. The reaction can be reversed by deacetylases [6,31]. To maintain stable cellular homeostasis and trigger cellular functions, such as axon regeneration, a precise balance between acetylation and deacetylation of microtubules is intrinsically required for cellular activities [22]. Hence, studying the mechanisms of microtubule acetylation/deacetylation regulators is critical for understanding the balance of microtubule acetylation. αTAT1/MEC-17 is one of the major acetyltransferase enzymes for α-tubulin that transfers the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA onto the α-tubulin-L-lysine for microtubule acetylation [25,32]. On the contrary, HDAC6 and SIRT2 were identified as two deacetylases catalyzing the deacetylation reaction that removes the acetyl group from α-tubulin [33,34].

In a recent advance, a novel deacetylase of α-tubulin, NDST3, has been identified, providing new insights into the understanding of microtubule dynamics and associated pathogenesis [6]. NDST3 was found to act as a classical HDAC that catalyzes the deacetylation reaction at the same site as HDAC6 and SIRT2 on α-tubulin [6]. Because NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 have all been identified as enzymes involved in the deacetylation of α-tubulin at K40, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which they regulate the deacetylated level of microtubules and allow cells to achieve an appropriate balance of microtubule acetylation and deacetylation (Figure 1C). Through an overview of the current evidence, several possible mechanisms can be proposed by which NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 cooperate to deacetylate the microtubule network.

SIRT2, HDAC6, and NDST3 have similar effects on cellular processes, yet their mechanisms are different on various levels. SIRT2 colocalizes and immunoprecipitates with HDAC6 in vivo [33]. HDAC6 and SIRT2 are also thought to locate within the same multiprotein complex and interact with each other to work synergistically [33]. SIRT2 and HDAC6, on the other hand, have different activation requirements for their tubulin deacetylation function. That is, the tubulin deacetylase activity of SIRT2 requires the participation of the coenzyme NAD+, whereas the HDAC6 activity is constitutive [33]. Our previous study [6] found that the coenzyme NAD+ is not required for the deacetylase activity of NDST3 on tubulin and that the activity cannot be inhibited by SIRT2 inhibitors. However, NDST3 is inhibited by a classical HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), which also inhibits the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. The individual effect of NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 on tubulin deacetylation was suggested by the observation that inhibiting each of them alone was sufficient to cause tubulin hyperacetylation in cells [6,33,34]. Thus, these enzymes might function interdependently [33]. However, the overexpression of HDAC6 in NDST3 KO cells was able to reverse the hyperacetylation of tubulin and vice versa, indicating that NDST3 and HDAC6 can catalyze tubulin deacetylation in the absence of each other and casting doubt on the hypothesis that they function interdependently [6]. Therefore, whether NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 interdependently function together or independently function like isoenzymes still need further investigation.

HDAC6 and SIRT2 are found localized in specific cell types in the nervous system [35]. Specifically, HDAC6 is mainly found in neurons, while SIRT2 is specifically expressed in oligodendrocytes. The expression of NDST3 in various cell types has yet been determined. Moreover, tissue-specific expression of NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 has been observed in various human tissue types [36]. Transcriptome profiling suggests that NDST3 is enriched in the brain and spleen. HDAC6 is expressed throughout various tissue types without specific enrichment. SIRT2 has a predominant expression in the brain without specific enrichment in other areas of the body [36]. The fact that NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 have different expression patterns in different tissues and cells suggests their cell- and tissue-specific functions, which could be explored in future studies.

Apart from the enzymatic activity catalyzing microtubule deacetylation through tubulin substrates, NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 also exhibit activities on other substrates (Table 1). Given this feature, NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 might function independently under different physiological conditions, such as various stressful environments. In addition, NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 are regulated by different mechanisms in physiological conditions. The expression of NDST3 is regulated by the C9orf72 protein [6]. In the C9orf72 knockdown cells, NDST3 expression is significantly decreased. No regulation of HDAC6 or SIRT2 by C9orf72 has been reported. Therefore, the difference in the regulatory mechanism of the expression of NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 can be further examined.

The microtubule deacetylation by NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 might be a site-dependent function. Recombinant HDAC6 induces random deacetylation along the length of microtubules in acetylated microtubules [8,48]. NDST3 knockdown is associated with elevated microtubule acetylation, and this excessive microtubule acetylation predominantly present in the perinuclear region [6]. SIRT2 may target sites where microtubule remodeling occurs, such as in the myelin inner loop and the myelin paranode structure [35]. Therefore, it is possible that NDST3, HDAC6, and SIRT2 separately modulate the tubulin deacetylation in distinct sites of microtubules to trigger various downstream biological processes.

NDST3 IS A NOVEL REGULATOR OF LYSOSOMAL ACIDIFICATION

V-ATPase assembly on the lysosomal membrane is a downstream process regulated by microtubule acetylation [6]. The V-ATPase acts as a proton pump to maintain the acidic pH of the lumen of the lysosome. It is a holoenzyme containing two domains: the cytosolic V-ATPase V1 domain and the transmembrane V0 domain. Each of the two domains is composed of several subunits. In mammalian cells, the V0 domain comprises membrane-embedded subunits a, c, c”, d, e, Ac45, and (pro)renin receptors, and the V1 domain consists of eight free cytosolic subunits (A-H) [49]. The V-ATPase complex can only exert its function to pump cytosolic H+ into the lysosomal lumen when the V1 domain is assembled onto the V0 domain; therefore, the assembly status is a reflection of V-ATPase activity efficiency [50]. The V-ATPase V1 subunit V1C1 and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 colocalize in a perinuclear area where microtubule acetylation was enriched [6]. Upregulation of microtubule acetylation increases V-ATPase assembly; conversely, downregulation of microtubule acetylation decreases the assembly of V-ATPase [6].

By affecting the microtubule acetylation level, NDST3 modulates the assembly of V-ATPase and is subsequently involved in the regulation of lysosomal acidification [6]. As the lysosomal function is highly dependent on the activity of the pH-sensitive resident hydrolases, the acidification of lysosomes is precisely controlled to provide optimal homeostasis for the activity of hydrolases. The activation of the resident hydrolases in lysosomes can be hampered by either under- or over-acidification [51,52]. As an example, over-acidification induced by some factors such as microtubule hyperacetylation [6,53] and mutations in the ion channel mucolipin 1 (TRP-ML1) [52] led to impaired lysosomal activity. Autophagy inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine have been shown to inactivate lysosomal hydrolases, including cathepsins, by basifying the lysosomal environment [54]. The impairment of lysosomal activity is related to numerous diseases, particularly NDs [55,56], and drives various symptoms such as cognitive and motor disorders [57].

TARGETING NDST3 TO TREAT NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES

The central nervous system is highly susceptible to damages that impair cellular functions. Microtubule dysfunction and proteotoxic damages, resulting from the dysregulation of microtubule acetylation and the defective autophagy-lysosomal pathway, respectively, are considered major pathogenic mechanisms involved in many NDs, including ALS/FTD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), AD and PD [14,58,59]. The discovery of the NDST3-microtubule acetylation-lysosomal acidification cascade provides a new avenue for the treatment of NDs. In addition to the modulation of the microtubule dynamics, NDST3 can also be targeted to improve the lysosomal function. Increase of lysosomal pH is one of the main features for many types of NDs, including AD, PD, and neurodegenerative LSDs [60]. To reverse this condition and potentially develop a treatment for NDs, NDST3 function can be inhibited to restore the acidity in lysosomes. Furthermore, abnormal expression of NDST3 or microtubule acetylation has been observed in several NDs, such as ALS, schizophrenia, AD, and PD [6,20,61]. This dysregulation of NDST3 supports the idea that restoration of its normal expression might be a possible treatment strategy for NDs.

C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD

ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons that control voluntary muscle movement. FTD is characterized by frontotemporal lobe degeneration, which induces dementia in patients. Even though ALS and FTD express distinct clinical symptoms, the genetics and pathologies of these two diseases have shared features, implying the overlapping pathogenesis of the diseases and they are referred to together as ALS/FTD [62]. The mortality rate of ALS is high, with most deaths caused by respiratory failure due to loss of voluntary muscle control [63]. Although FTD is not fatal, there are currently no therapeutic measures developed for ALS/FTD due to the lack of understanding of the causes of the diseases [63]. The recent discovery of C9orf72 gene mutation in a subset of ALS/FTD patients provides new insights into ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Patients carrying expanded hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeats in C9orf72 constitute the largest subset of familial ALS/FTD. The hexanucleotide expansion, in C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD (C9 ALS/FTD), results in both reduction of C9orf72 function and toxicity of repeat-containing RNA transcripts and aberrant poly-dipeptides generated through repeat-associated non-ATG-dependent translation [64,65]. Also, it was reported that the reduction of C9orf72 function would exacerbate the other forms of toxicities [66], consistent with the lysosomal dysfunction found in C9orf72 deficiency and related ALS/FTD models [67].

Our previous study demonstrated that C9orf72 positively regulates NDST3, the newly recognized microtubule deacetylase whose loss results in lysosomal hyperacidification and dysfunction. The reduction of C9orf72 function led to a marked downregulation of NDST3 in C9 ALS patients’ lymphocytes and spinal cords, which in turn exacerbated the proteotoxicity of proline-arginine poly-dipeptides [6]. This observation suggests that NDST3 is involved in the lysosomal dysfunction in C9 ALS/FTD and it could be modified to treat C9 ALS/FTD. It is possible that a balance in the level of NDST3 is important for the optimal microtubule and lysosomal functions as well as the neuronal health. To balance the NDST3 level in C9 ALS/FTD, recombinant NDST3 therapeutic agent or mimics possessing deacetylase activity on α-tubulin would be a good option, which can be tested using C9 ALS/FTD models in the future.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental disorders affecting about 2% of the population [68]. Although increasing research has recognized schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as neurological diseases with regional degeneration of neuronal cells [69,70], the exact causes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have not yet been clarified. In recent genome-wide association studies, NDST3 was reported to be implicated in these diseases. Data from examining the postmortem cerebellar tissue samples collected from patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in the Caucasian population showed a significant relationship between the expression of NDST3 and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at rs11098403 [61]. It demonstrated that the carriers of the rs11098403 risk allele had a higher expression level of NDST3 when compared with homozygotes for the common allele. Thus, abnormality in NDST3 expression is considered to be a predisposition to severe psychiatric disease. Another study showed an association of the rs11098403 polymorphism with hippocampal NDST3 expression [71]. In the study, the carriers of the rs11098403 G allele had higher expression of NDST3 in the hippocampus than the carriers of the normal rs11098403 A allele. Interestingly, the study suggested that the rs11098403 G allele was likely to be a protective factor for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese populations, but a risk factor among Caucasian populations. The protective effect of the rs11098403 G allele in the development of schizophrenia was also observed in another study performed in a Han Chinese population [72]. However, this observation is controversial since another group did not find evidence for a major role of the NDST3 gene in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in the Han Chinese population [73]. In addition to the changes in NDST3 levels, dysregulations in the microtubule network and the protein degradation system have also been implicated in schizpphrenia and bipolar disorder [9,74,75]. Taken together, these studies suggest NDST3 may play an important role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by influencing microtubule and lysosomal functions, which could be studied in future studies by comparing the NDST3 protein levels between schizophrenia/ bipolar disorder patients and healthy controls in different populations. This hypothesis can be further tested on genetic models with either reduced or increased levels of NDST3 expression.

Neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders

LSDs are a class of diseases characterized by defects in lysosomal resident enzymes or accumulation of undigested cargos in the lysosome. A large percentage of LSD patients developed neurodegenerative complications, consistent with the critical role of lysosomal-related dysfunction in the pathogenesis of LSDs [76–78]. Although there is no current evidence suggesting any change in NDST3 expression in LSDs, the connection of NDST3 function and lysosomal acidification provides a possible therapeutic approach for LSDs via the targeting of NDST3. The alkalinized lysosomal environment is observed in various LSDs, such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses [79, 80], mucolipidosis type IV [81], and sialic acid storage diseases [82]. Since the activity of lysosomal resident hydrolases is highly dependent on the acidic environment inside the lysosomes, restoring the acidic environment of the lysosomal lumen, by inhibiting NDST3 function, could be a potential strategy to alleviate the symptoms of these LSDs.

The inhibition of NDST3 could be achieved by specific inhibitors that block the enzymatic activity of NDST3 on microtubule deacetylation. However, as no NDST3 specific inhibitor is currently available to block its deacetylase activity on tubulin, inhibitor screening would be needed before NDST3 can be targeted for the treatment of LSDs. Multiple methods could be used to screen for inhibitors, including virtual screening by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, in vitro enzymatic assays, and cell-based cytoblot assay and high-content analysis [83, 84]. With the specific inhibitors, validation of the therapeutic effect of targeting NDST3 can be performed on established models that recapitulate the clinical disease-relevant symptoms of LSDs.

Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease

Aggregation of misfolded protein deposition in neurons is the hallmark of numerous NDs [85]. Failure in the degradation of these pathological aggregats is attributed in part to defects in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway [60,86,87]. Deficiency in lysosomal acidification is a common feature of AD, and the accumulation of Aβ and tau in AD patients is thought to induce the neurodegeneration [58,88,89]. Mutation in the gene that encodes for protein presenilin-1 (PS1) has been reported to cause impaired lysosomal acidification and early-onset AD [51]. The inhibition of lysosomal acidification by chloroquine treatment delayed tau clearance and induced accumulation of tau aggregation [90]. Beyond proteostasis, lysosomal pH dysregulation can trigger other functional damages in neurons, including impairment of synaptic plasticity, disturbance of vesicle transport, and dystrophic axonal swellings [91,92]. Evidence suggests that normalization of lysosomal acidity is a possible therapeutic intervention for AD [93], which was supported by research results that restoration of lysosomal acidification enabled clearance of the Aβ accumulation and successfully reversed AD phenotypes [94]. Similar defects in lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates, such as α-synuclein and tau aggregates, are also observed in PD patients as a result of alteration of lysosomal acidification [60,95]. Several studies revealed the role of PD-associated proteins ATP13A2, LRRK2, and TMEM175 in the regulation of lysosomal pH, highlighting the link between lysosomal acidification and PD [96]. In several forms of PD, mutations in ATP13A2 [97], LRRK2 [98], and TMEM175 [99] cause an increase in lysosomal pH through various mechanisms. Thus, it is plausible that these genetic mutations lead to a proteolytic failure that contributes to the accumulation of insoluble α-synuclein and tau [100].

In addition, microtubule acetylation is implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, manifested by altered tubulin acetylation levels [20]. Decreased level of α-tubulin acetylation has been detected in AD models as well as in postmortem human AD patients [26,29,101]. Thus, acetylation of tubulin is regarded as a possible strategy in the treatment of AD. In concert with this perspective, HDAC6 inhibitors, such as tubastatin A (TubA), effectively restored the impaired α-tubulin acetylation, rescued the disrupted mitochondrial transport, caused changes in tau-isoform expression, decreased Aβ deposition, and ameliorated other phenotypes related to AD pathology in previous observations [102]. Additionally, in a PD model with LRRK2 mutation, deacetylated microtubules were observed. But after the treatment of HDAC6 inhibitor TubA or in the case of overexpression of the microtubule acetyltransferase α-TAT1, the microtubule acetylation was restored, leading to significantly improved behavioral phenotypes [103]. Subsequent studies provided supportive evidence for the therapeutic effect of HDAC6 and SIRT2 inhibitors in other PD models [104–106].

Currently, several HDAC6 inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials and demonstrated their potential efficacy in treating NDs, including AD and PD [28,102]. The function of NDST3 in deacetylating microtubules resembles that of HDAC6. In our previous report, NDST3 shows features of a classical HDAC6-like enzyme, since its activity can be inhibited by TSA [6]. Given the similarity between NDST3 and HDAC6, NDST3 may become an alternative to HDAC6 to be targeted in treating AD and PD.

Other neurodegenerative diseases

Microtubule acetylation and deacetylation processes have been widely studied in other neurodegenerative diseases. In HD models, the defects in microtubule-dependent transport and autophagic flux were reported to be reversed by HDAC6 inhibitors [22]. Additionally, SIRT2 is thought to influence neuronal cholesterol biosynthesis in HD models [107]. In another example related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2A (CMT2A), an inherited ND characterized by impairment in the peripheral nervous system, HDAC6 inhibition was protective in mice with CMT2A peripheral neuropathy by restoring microtubule acetylation in the distal sciatic nerves [108]. The similarity in effects of NDST3 with HDAC6 and SIRT2 on microtubule acetylation suggests that NDST3 might be an alternative to HDAC6 or SIRT2 to be targeted to treat these diseases.

CONCLUSION

Microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification have been widely recognized to be implicated in various NDs. The discovery of NDST3 as a novel regulator for both α-tubulin deacetylation and lysosomal functions provides a new perspective for the association of the NDST3 expression and pathogenesis of NDs. By regulating these two essential cellular functions, NDST3 plays important roles in maintaining microtubule dynamics and protein quality control. Functionally, NDST3 shows quite similarity to HDAC6 and SIRT2. However, the mechanisms through which NDST3 may cooperate with HDAC6 and SIRT2 to regulate the microtubule acetylation remains unclear. In various NDs, microtubule deacetylation was observed to be one of the most important causes of neurodegeneration. In the meantime, dysfunctional protein degradation and accumulation of protein waste are a hallmark for many NDs. Given the role of NDST3 in microtubule acetylation and lysosomal acidification, NDST3 can be utilized as a novel target for the treatment of NDs based on the recent advances in the understanding of its enzymatic functions. The investigation and validation of NDST3 as a target of NDs’ treatment will provide new strategies for treating NDs in the future.
