Introduction

The A/T/N classification system1 is the foundation of the 2018 NIA-AA Research Framework.2 Participants are assigned to one of eight A/T/N profiles based on whether amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers are normal or abnormal. In turn, these eight profiles comprise four categories: AD (amyloid and tau both abnormal), AD pathophysiology (amyloid, but not tau, abnormal), and normal (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration normal).2 The framework is intended to guide for the next 5-10 years the AD research agenda.2

Clinical trials testing potential treatments in the preclinical and early AD stages will be an important part of that agenda. These trials require evidence of both clinically meaningful cognitive and functional outcomes to demonstrate effectiveness.

Driving is a widespread functional activity that declines with symptomatic AD.3 Recent work links driving and AD biomarker abnormalities among older adults who are cognitively normal.3, 4 Since the A/T/N framework is based solely on biomarkers, it may be particularly useful in investigation of functional changes in pathological AD before onset of cognitive symptoms. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine driving in preclinical AD using the A/T/N framework.

Methods

Detailed information on study participants and methodology have been published.3 Briefly, participants had normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]5 = 0), were aged 65 years and older, drove an automobile at least once per week, and had amyloid imaging and/or CSF collection within 2 years prior to, or 6 months after, the baseline assessment. At baseline and subsequent annual visits participants took part in clinical assessments, self-reported their current driving practices using the Driving Habits Questionnaire (DHQ),6 and completed an on-road driving test.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents

Study protocols were approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office, and written informed consent was obtained.

Statistical analyses

Each participant was assigned to one of the eight possible A/T/N profiles (A+/T+/N+, A+/T+/N-, A+/T-/N+, A+/T-/N-, A-/T+/N+, A-/T+/N-, A-/T-/N+, A-/T-/N-).2 Amyloid abnormality on PET imaging was operationalized as a florbetapir (F-AV-45) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of ≥1.2194 or an SUVR≥1.31 for Pittsburgh Compound B.3 An “A+” designation was assigned when either amyloid imaging or CSF Aβ42 values (based on date and assay3) were abnormal. “T+” was assigned when CSF ptau181≥67 pg/mL and “N+” when tau≥339 pg/mL.7 Three A/T/N groups reflecting normal biomarkers, AD pathology, and AD were then constructed based on the A/T/N classifications.2 Participants with suspected non-Alzheimer’s pathophysiology (SNAP,2 N=34) were excluded from analyses.

Age-adjusted differences between the A/T/N groups at baseline on everyday self-reported driving practices (driving space, miles driven, number of places visited, and number of trips over the previous year)6 were examined using general linear models. Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, tested differences in the time from baseline to first rating of Marginal or Fail (vs. Pass) on the yearly driving test as a function of A/T/N group. Linear mixed models, adjusted for age, tested self-reported decline over time on everyday driving practices assessed using the DHQ.

Results

A total of 123 participants with a mean±SD age of 72.4±4.6 years and education of 16.4 ± 2.6 years met inclusion criteria. Seventy-three (78.3%) were normal (A-/T-/N-), 25 (15.9%) had AD pathology (A+) and 25 (15.9%) had AD (A+/T+). Participants with longitudinal data (N=97) were followed up to 4.4 years (mean±SD=2.7±0.9). There were no differences between the A/T/N groups in everyday driving behaviors at baseline driving evaluation (p&gt;.212), nor in decline of these behaviors with time (p&gt;.533).

There were significant unadjusted (p=.024, Figure 1) and adjusted (p=.031) effects of A/T/N group on time from baseline to a marginal/fail rating on the driving test. Participants with AD received a marginal/fail rating earlier than those with normal A/T/N biomarkers (HR=3.36, 95%CI=1.37-8.25, p=.008), whereas there was no difference between those with normal A/T/N biomarkers and AD pathology (HR=1.53, 95%CI=0.59-4.02, p=.385) in time to a marginal/fail rating.

Discussion

Examination of driving behavior using the A/T/N framework showed no associations between preclinical AD and cross-sectional, self-reported driving behavior at baseline, but this framework predicts time to onset of objectively-measured driving problems.

These results have implications for participant selection into clinical trials and for the application time of interventions aimed at prolonging the time of safe driving among older adults with preclinical AD. Because the onset of driving difficulties is most associated with abnormality of both amyloid and tau pathology, rather than amyloid alone, our results suggest that the best time to introduce interventions is once amyloid biomarkers are abnormal, but before abnormalities are present in both tau and neurodegeneration.
