Study Objective:

What is the association between anticholinergic burden and specific domains of cognitive function in older adults who are initially without major cognitive impairment?

Design:

Post-hoc analysis of longitudinal observational data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study.

Patients:

19,114 participants from Australia and the United States aged 70 years and older (65 years and older for US minorities) were recruited and followed for a median of 4.7 years. At enrollment, participants were free of known cardiovascular disease, major physical disability, or dementia.

Measurements:

Cognitive assessments administered at baseline and biennially at follow-up visits included the Modified Mini-Mental State examination (3MS), Hopkins Verbal Learning Test– Revised (HVLT-R) delayed recall, Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). Anticholinergic burden was calculated at baseline using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale and grouped as scores of 0 (no burden), 1–2 (low to moderate), or 3+ (high).

Main Results:

Linear mixed effects models were used to assess the relationship between ACB score and cognition over time. After adjusting for sex, age, education, minority status, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, depression, chronic kidney disease, country, and frailty, participants with a high ACB score had worse performance over time for 3MS (Adjusted [Adj] B=−0.092, P=0.034), HVLT-R delayed recall (Adj B=−0.104, P&lt;0.001), COWAT (Adj B=−0.151, P&lt;0.001), and SDMT (Adj B=−0.129, P=0.026), than participants with an ACB score of 0. A low to moderate ACB score was also associated with worse performance over time for HVLT-R delayed recall (Adj B=−0.037, P=0.007) and COWAT (Adj B=−0.065, P=0.003), compared to those with no ACB.

Conclusions:

Anticholinergic burden predicts worse cognitive function over time in initially dementia-free older adults, particularly for executive function (COWAT) and episodic memory (HVLT-R).

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

There is a growing concern that use of medications with anticholinergic properties can increase the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment. Anticholinergics reportedly have short-term cognitive side effects,1 and medications with high anticholinergic activity are considered potentially inappropriate for use in older adults according to both the American Geriatrics Society Beers criteria2 and the Screening Tool of Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions (STOPP) criteria.3

Despite the evidence suggesting anticholinergics adversely affect cognition,4 anticholinergics are still often used for conditions commonly associated with dementia in older adults, such as depression and urinary incontinence, which potentially confounds the determination of a causal relationship. Most prior research has been limited by small samples,5–7 or focused only on singular cognitive domains,8 or global function.6,9 Additionally, some studies did not exclude participants with dementia or cognitive impairment at study enrollment,6,8–11 leaving open the possibility that the relationship is confounded by indication. As a result, an important question left unanswered is whether anticholinergic medication use in healthy older adults is associated with cognitive decline over time, and whether specific cognitive domains are more strongly affected. A more thorough investigation of the relationship between anticholinergics and specific domains of cognitive function could potentially yield insight into causality and the underlying mechanisms involved.

We have recently shown that higher anticholinergic burden was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia, particularly for mixed/vascular dementia (which was the classification employed when there was a likely non-Alzheimer’s contribution, typically small vessel vascular disease on neuroimaging), over a 4.7-year follow-up period in participants of the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial.12 In this analysis, we aimed to expand this earlier work to determine whether anticholinergic burden is associated with change over time in global cognition and within specific domains, including processing speed, executive function, and episodic memory. We hypothesize that higher anticholinergic burden would be associated with higher rates of cognitive decline in all domains, but especially executive functioning. This hypothesis is based on the following: (1) anticholinergics work predominately by blocking the M1 muscarinic receptors, which are most abundant in the cerebral cortex, neostriatum, and hippocampus, and appear to be involved with executive functioning and episodic memory13; and (2) our previous findings demonstrated that anticholinergic burden is most strongly associated with mixed/vascular dementia,12 and decline in executive functioning is a prominent characteristic of vascular dementia.14

2 | METHODS

2.1 | Study design

This is a post hoc analysis of longitudinal observational data from the ASPREE study, which enrolled 19,114 participants 70 years of age and older (65 years and older for US minorities) from Australia (n = 16,703) and the United States (n = 2411). Participants were randomized (double-blind) to daily 100 mg aspirin or placebo, with a median follow-up of 4.7 years (March 2010–June 2017), to assess disability-free survival. At enrollment, participants were free of known cardiovascular disease, significant limitation in basic activities of daily living (physical disability), dementia or major cognitive impairment, and were required to have a Modified Mini-Mental State examination (3MS) score of 78 or more on screening.15 Further details on the ASPREE methods are published elsewhere.16

2.2 | Medication collection and anticholinergic burden

Prescription medications were collected at baseline and updated at the annual visits, and reviewed by ASPREE study staff and coded using the Anatomical and Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) coding system.17 Prescription medications initiated after baseline had an unknown exact initiation date, only whether the participant used the medication any time in the calendar year (eg, 2016) of the follow-up visit date. Full details on the medication coding process have been published previously.18

Anticholinergic burden was calculated using the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale,19 which quantifies the degree of anticholinergic exposure from anticholinergic medication use.19,20 Although there are several scales to measure anticholinergic burden, the ACB scale received the highest rating for quality of publications and validation studies in a 2021 systematic review.21 Medications that have possible anticholinergic effects, but do not have clinical evidence of negative cognitive effects, are assigned an ACB score of 1. If the medication has clinically negative cognitive effects it is assigned an ACB score of 2, or 3 if blood-brain permeability of the medication is high.19 The ACB score of all prescription medications that the ASPREE participant was using at baseline was then summed, and participants were categorized based on their total ACB score into three groups; ACB 0 (no anticholinergic burden), ACB 1–2 = low to moderate, and ACB 3+ = high. To determine whether the participant changed ACB score group over the trial, the ACB score group was calculated at each follow-up year until the participant exited the study (via withdrawal, death, or end of the trial period). The majority of participants (75%) remained in the same ACB group during the follow-up period.

2.3 | Cognitive measures

Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline and biennially at the follow-up annual visits (years 1, 3, 5) and the final/closeout annual visit (which could correspond to any annual visit in years 3–7 depending on when the participant was recruited into the trial as participants were recruited from 2010 to 2014). Cognitive assessments included as follows: 3MS to measure global cognitive function, which consists of 34 questions from 15 items that assess numerous domains of cognition including verbal recall, verbal fluency, reasoning, attention, visual construction, and expressive language (min score 0, max score 100, higher scores indicate better cognition)22; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) delayed recall to measure episodic memory and requires participants to recall a list of 12 nouns (four words from three semantic categories) after a 20–25 min delay after presentation (min 0, max 12, higher scores indicate better episodic memory)23; Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT— single letter version) to measure executive function and verbal fluency by requiring participants to produce words starting with a designated letter (min 0, no upper limit, higher scores indicate better executive functioning)24; and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) to assess psychomotor speed and requires a participant to match digits with abstract symbols using a reference key (min 0, max 110, higher scores indicate better psychomotor speed).25 To investigate overall cognitive performance across the four cognitive tests (“composite cognitive score”),26 the first step required was generating z-scores to standardize the scores for the individual cognitive tests at each time point (Z - score at time t=Participants score at time t−sample meanSample standard deviation). The z-scores for each test could then be summed together to give the composite score. A similar process was followed to generate composite scores for executive/psychomotor functioning and memory, which are important domains of cognitive function in older individuals and were assessed across more than one of the individual tests. Composite executive/psychomotor functioning was derived by summing z-scores SDMT, COWAT and the similarities subscales of the 3MS, while composite memory was derived by summing z-scores HVLT-R delayed recall and the memory subscales of the 3MS.

2.4 | Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics were used to compare participant characteristics according to ACB score group. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each baseline ACB score group across annual visit and for each cognitive measure. The number of participants who completed a cognitive measure was also reported for each time point and baseline ACB score group. Prevalence of anticholinergic burden medications by country was also presented.

Linear mixed-effects models (LMM) were used to analyze the effect of baseline ACB score group on cognitive function measures at a series of annual visits. Data collected from year 2, and year 7 were excluded from the analysis as very few participants (&lt;100) had data available at these time points (due to cognitive assessments not being part of the measurement protocol in year 2 and too few participants reaching year 7 by the time the study ended). Each cognitive measure was modeled using separate LMM, and was adjusted for baseline covariates including sex, age at randomization, years of education, minority status, smoking status, 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10),27 hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), country, and Fried frailty.28 A participant-specific random intercept and random slope were included in the LMM as exploratory analysis suggested there was considerable between-participant variability in baseline cognitive scores and cognitive scores over time. Interaction effects between baseline ACB score group and cognition over time (0 [baseline], 1 [annual visit 1], 3, 4, 5, 6) were also included to assess whether the rate of change in cognitive performance over time differed between ACB score groups. To enable comparisons between cognitive domains, cognitive test scores were also standardized (relative to the baseline mean and standard deviation). Further, the model estimates of ACB score group on cognitive performance over time were compared to the model age estimate, thus revealing the impact of ACB score group in terms of equivalent years of aging. Pairwise comparisons, with Tukey method p-value adjustment, were also calculated to compare cognitive performance over time between participants with an ACB score of 1–2 and participants with an ACB score of 3+. Sensitivity analysis was conducted by limiting the analysis to individuals who remained in the same ACB score group over the follow-up period. Further sensitivity analysis was conducted by adjusting for diabetes and blood pressure control. All analyses were performed using R (v 4.2).29

2.5 | Ethics

In the United States, ethics approval was granted by the relevant Institutional Review Board at study sites. In Australia, primary ethics approval was granted by Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee [CF07/3730 – 2006/745MC]. All participants provided informed consent.

3 | RESULTS

At baseline, participants with higher ACB scores were older, had higher CESD-10 depression scores, were more likely to be minority, female, and have fewer years of education. They were also more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, CKD, and be frail or pre-frail (Table 1). Although the majority of participants used only one anticholinergic medication at baseline, a quarter of individuals in the higher burden category (3+) used two medications, and almost 10% used more than two.

At baseline, higher ACB scores were generally associated with lower scores across all cognitive tests (Table 2). In the longitudinal analysis, over a median of 4.7 years participants with the highest burden score (3+), compared with those not using anticholinergic medications, had significantly worse performance over time with respect to 3MS (Adjusted [Adj] B = −0.092, p = 0.034), HVLT-R delayed recall (Adj B = −0.104, p &lt; 0.001), COWAT (Adj B = −0.151, p &lt; 0.001), and the SDMT (Adj B = −0.129, p = 0.026). Similar findings were observed for the composite scores: executive/psychomotor functioning (Adj B = −0.048, p &lt; 0.001), memory (Adj B = −0.037, p = 0.004), and overall cognitive score (Adj B = −0.102, p &lt; 0.001). The standardized scores permitted comparisons of the effect sizes for the different cognitive tests, which indicates that a high ACB score was most strongly associated with worse performance over time in performance for HVLT-R delayed recall and COWAT. Further, compared to the model age estimates, participants with an ACB score of 3+ had a worse performance over time for 3MS, HVLT-R delayed recall, COWAT, and the SDMT that is the equivalent to 0.5 (−0.092 [ACB score 3+*time]/−0.177 [age]), 0.8, 4.4, and 0.2 years of aging, respectively.

Participants with an ACB score of 1–2 had significantly worse performance over time with respect to HVLT-R delayed recall (Adj B = −0.037, p = 0.007), COWAT (Adj B = −0.065, p = 0.003), and composite cognitive score (Adj B = −0.035, p = 0.003) than participants with an ACB score of 0. There was no significant difference in cognitive performance over time between participants with an ACB score of 1–2 and participants with an ACB score of 0 for other cognitive domains. To illustrate performance over time for the specific cognitive domains across each ACB score group, estimated marginal means over time were calculated and visualized using line plots (Figure 1). These results remained consistent in sensitivity analysis including only participants who remained in the same ACB score group over follow-up (n = 14,383) (Table S1). Adjusting for diabetes and blood pressure control did not change the results of the analysis (Table S3).

The findings from the multiple comparisons (Table 3) showed that HVLT-R delayed recall (p = 0.012) and composite cognitive score (p = 0.003) were significantly worse for participants with a high ACB score (ACB score 3+) compared to participants with a low-to-moderate ACB score (ACB score 1–2).

4 | DISCUSSION

In this post hoc analysis of participants from the ASPREE study, we found that community-dwelling adults who were initially free of major cognitive impairment and who were classified as having a low-to-moderate, or high anticholinergic burden, had lower cognitive function in all cognitive domains at study enrollment. Congruent with the stated hypothesis, we found that anticholinergic burden also predicted worse performance over time in all cognitive domains, but was particularly notable for the specific cognitive domain of episodic memory (HVLT-R delayed recall) and executive function (COWAT), than for global cognition (3MS) or processing speed (SDMT).

By investigating the impact of anticholinergic burden on specific cognitive domains, the present findings build upon our earlier work that showed an association between anticholinergic burden and incident dementia.12 For all cognitive domains in combination (composite cognitive score), those with high or low-to-moderate anticholinergic burden had worse performance over time in cognition compared to those with no anticholinergic burden. Both composite executive/psychomotor functioning and composite memory had worse performance over time in those with high anticholinergic burden, though the effect was not seen with low-to-moderate anticholinergic burden. Further, high degrees of anticholinergic burden predicted worse performance over time in executive function, episodic memory, global cognition, and processing speed, with these effects being equal to 4.4, 0.8, 0.5, and 0.2 years of aging, respectively. Although, only episodic memory and executive function were impacted by having low-to-moderate anticholinergic burden. It should be noted, however, that executive function appeared to decline with age at a slower rate than other cognitive domains, which may lead to an overestimation of the clinical importance of anticholinergic burden on executive function (compared to other cognitive domains). The standardized effects, which reflects cognitive change in terms of standard deviations from the baseline mean, indicated that executive function and episodic memory had the strongest association with anticholinergic burden, and these two cognitive domains appeared equally impacted. Taken together, these findings suggest that anticholinergic burden is associated with worse performance over time in all domains of cognition, although the associations were strongest with executive function and episodic memory. These findings are largely in line with the stated hypothesis, in which anticholinergic burden was expected to be associated with decline in all domains of cognition, particularly executive functioning. However, the results did suggest that episodic memory was more strongly associated with anticholinergic burden than global cognition and processing speed, which was a somewhat unexpected finding.

The present findings are largely congruent with other research exploring the impact of anticholinergic medication use and cognitive change over time, although our study is the largest to examine multiple cognitive domains simultaneously. Fox et al. demonstrated that anticholinergic burden was associated with a decline in global cognition in participants aged 65 years and older over a 2-year follow-up period, though they did not exclude participants with major cognitive impairments at study enrollment.9 Further, in a study of 327 initially dementia-free adults aged 60 years and older, anticholinergic medication use was associated worse performance over time in multiple domains of cognition, including language, attention, and delayed non-verbal memory.5 Similar to the current findings, research has demonstrated that anticholinergic burden had a differential impact across the cognitive domains.11,30 Koyama et al.11 revealed that executive function was impacted by anticholinergic burden, but global cognition, processing speed, and episodic memory were unaffected. To the contrary, Papenberg et al.30 showed a significant association between anticholinergic burden and episodic memory, but not executive function or processing speed. Such inconsistencies in the literature may be related to a number of factors, including sample size, exclusion criteria (especially regarding dementia and cognitive impairments at enrollment), definition of anticholinergic exposure, and cognitive assessments used. Both Koyama et al. (n = 1429) and Papenberg et al. (n = 1473) had considerably smaller sample sizes than the present analysis, and Papenberg et al. did not exclude participants with dementia or cognitive impairments at study enrollment.11,30 Our data extends the research on anticholinergic medications and cognitive change over time by employing a large sample of initially dementia-free older adults and examining not only a global test of cognition but also three tests that assess different domains of function.

Though the current results do not provide causal evidence that anticholinergic medication use increases cognitive decline, the possibility of a causal pathway is strengthened by underlying biologic hypotheses that could explain the findings. Cholinergic activity is the most concentrated in the hippocampus, which is an important brain region for episodic memory.31 It has also been suggested that anticholinergic medication use may lead to brain changes similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease, such as the increase of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau proteins),32 which would also likely have an impact on episodic memory.33 Alternatively, a vascular mechanism, such as reduced glucose metabolism and cerebral atrophy,34 coincides with the results of our previous work, which demonstrated that anticholinergic burden increases the risk of vascular related dementia.12 A vascular hypothesis would also explain the current findings on executive function, as decline in executive function is a common symptom of vascular dementia.15 However, future research is needed to clearly establish the causal mechanism involved.

The present results add a number of important findings to the current literature on anticholinergics and cognition, in particular, the degree to which specific cognitive domains might be impacted by anticholinergics. Further, the current study involved older adults who were initially dementia-free and without major cognitive impairments at enrollment, suggesting that anticholinergic medication burden is negatively associated with cognitive change even in adults who reach older ages in relatively good cognitive health. Methodologically, the study sample size was large (n = 19,114) and the follow-up period was a median of 4.7 years, which increased the sensitivity of the analysis in detecting small changes across the specific cognitive domains. Additionally, a number of known demographic and risk factors were adjusted for in the analyses, missing data was not substantial and overall data quality was high.35

There are important limitations to the present analyses that should be considered, namely that only baseline prescription medication data were used to define anticholinergic burden. However, the majority of participants (75%) remained within the same ACB group throughout the trial, and sensitivity analysis excluding those who changed ACB score group during follow-up did not change the results. Secondly, we did not have doses or duration of exposure for individual medications, so we were unable to directly consider whether the association between anticholinergic burden and cognition is greater for longer periods of anticholinergic exposure. However, previous research has indicated that the duration of anticholinergic exposure is predictive of greater cognitive decline,4 suggesting that duration of anticholinergic burden may be an important clinical consideration. Third, the absolute decline in individual test scores were relatively small and the clinical significance of such small changes may be questioned. We believe that the results suggest that exposure to high anticholinergic burden may have clinically important cognitive impacts (assuming a causal effect), but only after an extended period of time, as the yearly decline estimates were small. Low-to-moderate anticholinergic exposure appears to have only subtle impacts, even after an extended period of time. Fourth, although a number of confounders were adjusted for in the analyses, unknown residual confounding, particularly by indication, is possible, which may suggest that the observed associations between anticholinergic burden and cognition are potentially overestimated. Lastly, it should be emphasized that these results are purely correlational. Nevertheless, our findings yield important insight into the potential adverse effects of anticholinergic burden on specific cognitive domains.

In summary, the present findings indicate that anticholinergic burden at baseline predicts cognitive decline across multiple specific cognitive domains in initially dementia-free older adults. Further, anticholinergic burden was most strongly associated with the domains of executive function and episodic memory. Although causation cannot be determined, the results reinforce some concern regarding the use of anticholinergics in older adults.
