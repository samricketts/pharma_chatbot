Summary

Onset of neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington’s disease, is strongly influenced by aging. Hallmarks of aged cells include compromised nuclear envelope integrity, impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport, and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks. We show that mutant huntingtin markedly accelerates all of these cellular phenotypes in a dose- and age-dependent manner in cortex and striatum of mice. Huntingtin-linked polyglutamine initially accumulates in nuclei, leading to disruption of nuclear envelope architecture, partial sequestration of factors essential for nucleocytoplasmic transport (Gle1 and RanGAP1), and intranuclear accumulation of mRNA. In aged mice, accumulation of RanGAP1 together with polyglutamine is shifted to perinuclear and cytoplasmic areas. Consistent with findings in mice, marked alterations in nuclear envelope morphology, abnormal localization of RanGAP1, and nuclear accumulation of mRNA were found in cortex of Huntington’s disease patients. Overall, our findings identify polyglutamine-dependent inhibition of nucleocytoplasmic transport and alteration of nuclear integrity as a central component of Huntington’s disease.


Introduction

Expansion of unstable repetitive sequences triggers various neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease (HD), myotonic dystrophy, spinocerebellar ataxias, and instances of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from hexanucleotide expansion in the C9ORF72 gene (Dejesus-Hernandez et al., 2011, Renton et al., 2011). Each of these diseases is characterized by abnormal nuclear and/or cytoplasmic aggregation of proteins.

Dynamic exchange of proteins and RNAs between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments is essential for cellular functioning but is gradually impaired in the course of normal aging (Yannarell et al., 1977, Fifkova et al., 1987, Pujol et al., 2002, Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006, D’angelo et al., 2009). Long-living postmitotic cells, especially neurons, are particularly susceptible to such age-related damage. Indeed, impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear integrity have been identified as hallmarks of aged neurons (Fifkova et al., 1987, Mertens et al., 2015). A flurry of recent reports has indicated that nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization is also markedly impaired in several models of repeat expansion disorders (Chapple et al., 2008, Mapelli et al., 2012, Freibaum et al., 2015, Jovicic et al., 2015, Kaneb et al., 2015, Liu et al., 2015, Rodriguez et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2015, Da Cruz and Cleveland, 2016, Lee et al., 2016, Nekrasov et al., 2016, Woerner et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2016, Shi et al., 2017). Furthermore, apparent disruption of the nuclear envelope or disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport has been reported in postmortem tissues from ALS (Kinoshita et al., 2009), Parkinson’s (Liu et al., 2012) and Alzheimer’s disease patients (Sheffield et al., 2006), and in cells expressing aggregation-prone proteins (Frost et al., 2016, Woerner et al., 2016).

To address the possible convergence of disease- and aging-related mechanisms in mediating nuclear dysfunction in the nervous system, we now focus on several mouse models, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neuronal progenitors and autopsy samples from HD patients. In all of these, we identify a crucial role for mutant huntingtin in accelerating hallmarks of cellular aging by progressive, dose-dependent disruption of the nucleocytoplasmic import/export machinery associated with compromised nuclear architecture and genome instability.

Results

Dose and age-dependent disruption of the nuclear envelope in brains of HD mice and Huntington’s disease patients

We investigated nuclear envelope alterations in mice expressing physiological levels of a ~175 CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion within one (HttQ7/Q175) or both (HttQ175/Q175) endogenous huntingtin (Htt) alleles (Heikkinen et al., 2012, Menalled et al., 2012, Smith et al., 2014, Carty et al., 2015). We first tested whether wild-type mice with 7 glutamines (Q) in both endogenous Htt alleles (HttQ7/Q7) develop age-dependent nuclear envelope defects in cortex and striatum, two HD-vulnerable brain regions in which &gt;80% of the cells are neurons detectable with the neuron-specific marker Neuronal Nuclear Antigen (NeuN) (Gusel’nikova and Korzhevskiy, 2015) (Figure S1A). For this, we followed lamin B1, a structural component of the nuclear lamina, as a marker of the nuclear envelope shape and an initial test of nuclear integrity. Consistent with aberrant nuclear architecture being a cellular hallmark of aging (Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006, Lopez-Otin et al., 2013), the number of abnormal nuclei increased two-fold in brains of 24 month-old compared to 6 month-old HttQ7/Q7 mice (from 21% to 39% in cortex and from 22% to 37% in striatum) (Figures 1A,C, S1B and S2A,B).

HttQ175 mice closely mimic the human genetic context, express mutant huntingtin containing expanded polyglutamine (polyQ Htt), and gradually develop behavioral and pathological abnormalities similar to those observed in HD patients (Heikkinen et al., 2012, Menalled et al., 2012, Smith et al., 2014, Carty et al., 2015). Strikingly, expression of HttQ175 from both alleles markedly increased the number of cells with altered nuclear envelopes to 89% in cortex and 62% in striatum of 24 month-old HttQ175/Q175 mice (Figures 1A, C and S2A,B). Nuclear alterations triggered by expanded polyQ accumulation were dose dependent: by 24 months of age, cortex of heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice contained 72% and 89% of misshapen nuclei, respectively (Figures 1A, C). Dose dependency was also evident in striatum with 38% and 62% aberrant nuclei in 24 month-old heterozygous HttQ175/Q7 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice, respectively (Figures S2A,B).

Consistent with the polyQ Htt exacerbating aging-associated nuclear envelope alterations, longitudinal analyses of 6 to 24 month-old heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice revealed gradual, age-dependent impairment of nuclear shape (Figures 1B,C and S2C). To precisely define the nuclear limits and determine the nuclear or extranuclear localization of polyQ Htt aggregates we used lamin B1 staining and DAPI. Intranuclear and extranuclear polyQ Htt aggregates increased in number and size with age in both heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice, being the most abundant by 24 month-old (Figures 1A–D and S2A,C). Cytoplasmic aggregates were apparent only after 9 months of age and increasing 3-fold from 18 to 24 months of age in cortex of heterozygous and homozygous HttQ175 mice (Figure 1D). Both heterozygous and homozygous HttQ175 mice demonstrated age-related changes in shape of intranuclear aggregates. While nuclei of young mice contained mostly round-shaped aggregates, elongated egg-shaped aggregates were often detected in older mice (Figures 1A,B and S2C). Disruption of nuclear shape was already evident in 6 and 9 month-old heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 mice prior to appearance of extranuclear aggregates, with 33% and 46% of cortical cells demonstrating altered nuclear envelopes while only rare nuclear polyQ Htt aggregates are detected in cortex at this stage (Figures 1B–D). Consistently, cortex of 6 and 9 month-old homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice contained 42% and 52% of cells with altered nuclear envelopes and predominantly nuclear polyQ Htt aggregates (Figures 1C–D, S2C).

In an additional HD model, the transgenic R6/2 mouse line (Mangiarini et al., 1996), severe alterations in nuclear lamina assembly were also present in 89% of cortical cells at much younger ages (3 months) (Figures 1C, S2D). R6/2 mice express a 23 kD human exon 1 fragment of huntingtin with a 120–125 polyQ expansion and develop severe, rapid onset of disease (Mangiarini et al., 1996). By 3 months of age nearly 100% of cortical cells with altered nuclear envelopes had nuclear polyQ aggregates (Figures 1C,D and S2D).

To test if the polyQ Htt-dependent changes in nuclear envelope morphology seen in mice reflected what occurs in human disease, we evaluated the nuclear envelope shape in iPSC-derived neuronal progenitors from HD and control individuals (Table S1). We observed that invaginations of the nuclear envelope were present in 50% of HD cells, compared to 13% in control cells, indicating that HD neuronal precursor cells are predisposed to nuclear defects (Figures 1E,F). We then confirmed the relevance of this cellular phenotype in human disease by analyzing the nuclear envelope shape within the motor cortex of 2 HD patients and 2 control individuals (Table S2). Strikingly, 55% of lamin B1-positive nuclei demonstrated misshapen nuclear envelopes as compared to 16 % in control individuals (Figure 1G,H).

Collectively, these data strongly indicate that expression of expanded polyQ-containing Htt exacerbates aging-associated alterations of the nuclear envelope architecture in cortex and striatum regions.

Expanded polyQ Huntingtin impairs nuclear integrity, inducing DNA damage

We next tested whether observed alterations in lamin assembly and nuclear envelope shape were associated with aging- and polyQ Htt-mediated nuclear envelope dysfunction. Envelope integrity is critically important for maintenance of genome stability and efficient DNA repair (Bukata et al., 2013). DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) accumulate in aging tissues (Mandavilli and Rao, 1996a, Mandavilli and Rao, 1996b, Wang et al., 2009) and DNA fragmentation has been implicated in neurological disorders, including HD (Dragunow et al., 1995, Enokido et al., 2010, Lu et al., 2014). Sites of DSBs are marked by phosphorylated histone H2AX, designated as γH2AX (Mandavilli and Rao, 1996b, Rogakou et al., 1998). Nuclear γH2AX foci accumulated with age in cortex of wild type HttQ7/Q7 mice (Figures S3A, B) with 13% and 54% of cells containing γH2AX foci at 6- and 24 months of age, respectively. Expanded Htt expression led to increase in DSBs in a dose-dependent manner in 24 month-old HttQ175 mice relative to HttQ7/Q7 mice, with γH2AX foci observed in 65% and 80% of cells from heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice, respectively (Figures S3A, B). Consistently, polyQ Htt expression increased the size of the γH2AX nuclear foci 3-fold in 24 month-old HttQ175/Q175 mice as compared to 24 month-old HttQ7/Q7 mice (Figure S3C). Additionally, DSBs accumulated in 73% of nuclei and increased in size in 3 month-old R6/2 mice, overall corroborating enhanced neuronal aging in polyQ Htt-expressing mice (Figure S3).

Intranuclear polyQ inhibits RNA export by sequestering RanGAP1 and Gle1

Alteration of nuclear envelopes during aging is associated with disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (Yannarell et al., 1977, D’angelo et al., 2009, Kelley et al., 2011). Since mutant huntingtin disrupted envelope integrity, we tested whether polyQ Htt also impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA and proteins. We used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify polyadenylated (polyA) RNAs (mRNA), and measured the ratios of polyA RNA signal intensities in nucleus and cytoplasm of 24-month-old control HttQ7/Q7, heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice. Expression of polyQ Htt was found to markedly exacerbate nuclear mRNA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner in HttQ175 mice (Figures 2A,B). In particular, 66% of cells in heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and 93% of cells in homozygous HttQ175/Q175 displayed nuclear to cytoplasmic polyA ratios above the mean of control HttQ7/Q7 mice.

Compromised nuclear RNA export was evident in second HD model mice, as mRNA accumulated in nuclei of cortical cells of 3-month old R6/2 mice (Figures 2A,B). Despite a recent proposal that cytoplasmic-only polyQ aggregates drive nuclear export deficits in R6/2 mice (Woerner et al., 2016), nuclear mRNA accumulation strongly correlated with the presence of nuclear polyQ, as &gt;99% of cells in the cortex of 3 month old R6/2 mice had intranuclear polyQ aggregates (in agreement with prior reports (Davies et al., 1997, Li et al., 2001)) (Figures 1D, S2D). To further address perturbed mRNA export in HD, we analyzed polyA RNA localization in motor cortex of Huntington’s disease patients (Table S2). Consistent with mouse models, the number of cells with marked nuclear mRNA accumulation increased two-fold in the cortex of Huntington’s disease patients as compared to control subjects (Figure 2C, Figure S3D).

Moreover, in cortical regions of heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice, nuclear expanded huntingtin co-aggregated with Gle1 (Figure 3A), a key component for mRNA export (Watkins et al., 1998) and with Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 (RanGAP1) (Figure 4A), a protein required for Ran-dependent nuclear import and export (Bischoff et al., 1995). Accordingly, nuclear Gle1/polyQ and RanGAP1/polyQ co-localizations were also observed in cortical regions of 3 month-old R6/2 mice (Figures 3B and 4A). Gle1 and Htt nuclear co-localization in HttQ175/Q175 mice was most evident at 12 and 18 months, and decreased at 24 months of age (Figures 3A,C). The decrease in nuclear Gle1 in 24 month-old mice is likely to be caused by reduced nuclear import of Gle1 due to chronic de-regulation of nuclear import machinery over the course of disease progression. Consistent with progressive impairment of nuclear import, RanGAP1/polyQ Htt co-localization within nuclei also peaked (in number and intensity) at 6 months of age and then decreased with age (Figure S4B, Movie S1), with the co-localization between RanGAP1 and polyQ Htt becoming perinuclear (Figures 4B,C and S4A,C and Movie S2). Prominent perinuclear RanGAP1/polyQ Htt co-localization was identified using Z-projections of 3 μM-thick optical stacks in cortex and striatum of older heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 and homozygous HttQ175/Q175 mice (Figures 4B–D and S4A,C). Consistently, in aged mice, intranuclear polyQ Htt inclusions were negative for RanGAP1 in cells with perinuclear RanGAP1/polyQ Htt aggregates (Figure 4B,C and Movie S2).

Accumulation of RanGAP1 and polyQ Htt in perinuclear area was age- and dose-dependent (Figures 4C,D and S4A), appearing initially in a few cells at 12 months of age in heterozygous HttQ7/Q175 mice and at 9 months of age in homozygous HttQ175/Q175. At later ages, both in cortex and striatum, the number of cells with aberrant perinuclear RanGAP1 increased, as did the size of the RanGAP1 aggregates in HttQQ7/Q175 and HttQ175/Q175 mice (Figures 4B–D and S4A,C). In addition, RanGAP1 (and more rarely Gle1) was observed inside cytoplasmic ring-shaped polyQ Htt aggregates at later ages in HttQ175 mice (Figures S4D,E). A gradual accumulation of RanGAP1, Gle1 and polyQ Htt in the cytoplasm – and/or reduced nuclear co-localization – further corroborated compromised nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins in cells expressing polyQ Htt. Moreover, aberrant perinuclear accumulation of RanGAP1, strikingly similar to that observed in polyQ Htt-expressing mice, accompanied physiological neuronal aging as it was found in 2% of cells in the cortex of 24 month-old HttQ7/Q7 mice, but not in 6 month-old HttQ7/Q7 (Figure S4F).

Furthermore, examination of iPSC-derived neuronal precursor cells expressing mutant huntingtin revealed 40% of cells with altered RanGAP1 distribution characterized by nuclear envelope invaginations with focal increased staining intensity, as compared to 13% in control cells (Figure S4G,H and Table S1). Finally, human brain autopsies (Table S2) of control individuals revealed a primarily perinuclear RanGAP1 signal (Figures 4E,F), even at advanced ages (e.g., 92 or 94 years old). In contrast, RanGap1 in HD patient samples was heterogeneously distributed into perinuclear clusters in 25% of cells examined in motor cortex (Figures 4E,F), strongly supporting perturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport as a consequence of polyQ Htt expression and a new pathological hallmark in HD.

Discussion

Our findings provide in vivo support for repeat expansion-mediated acceleration of neuronal aging with altered nuclear integrity and nucleocytoplasmic transport in HD. Indeed, polyQ Htt dramatically exacerbates nuclear dysfunction in a dose- and age-related manner, including alterations in the shape of the nuclear envelope, accumulation of DNA double strand breaks and compromised nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNA and proteins. Specifically, polyQ Htt initially forms intranuclear aggregates that sequester major regulators of nucleocytoplasmic transport Gle1 and RanGAP1, providing a likely explanation for polyQ Htt-mediated disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport. The initial defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport are accompanied by extranuclear accumulation of co-aggregating polyQ Htt and RanGAP1. Perinuclear accumulation of RanGAP1 also occurs in a small fraction of cortical and striatal cells in normal aging of wild-type animals, representing a new hallmark of cellular aging associated with neurodegeneration. Notably, alterations of the nuclear envelope were already present in iPSC-derived neuronal progenitors from HD patients, and mutant Htt-dependent exacerbation of RanGAP1 mislocalization was confirmed in motor cortex of HD patients, demonstrating perturbed nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization as a major component of HD.

Altogether, our data suggest common mechanisms underlying neuronal aging and pathogenesis. Indeed, several common hallmarks of aging, including mitochondria dysfunction, impaired protein homeostasis and degradation have previously been are associated with HD (Jenkins et al., 1993, Hay et al., 2004, Lin and Beal, 2006, Bennett et al., 2007). In addition, consistent with mutant Huntingtin accelerating cellular aging, a recent study reported an accumulation of epigenetic markers of aging in the brain of HD patients as compared to control subjects (Horvath et al., 2016). In line with this notion, several genetic, pharmacological and dietary anti-aging interventions have been reported to ameliorate aspects of HD in mouse models (Duan et al., 2003, Ma et al., 2007, Sadagurski et al., 2011, Tallaksen-Greene et al., 2014, Moreno et al., 2016).

PolyQ Htt-dependent accumulation of nuclear mRNA in HD patients and HD mouse models mice shown in this study adds to recent identification of similar mRNA export deficiency in cultured neurons following overexpression and aggregation of artificial β-sheet proteins, TDP-43, or Htt fragments (Woerner et al., 2016) and in iPS-derived neurons from ALS/FTD patients with C9ORF72 hexanucleotide expansion (Freibaum et al., 2015). Expanded RNA repeats and/or the polypeptides produced by translation of those repeats have recently been reported to interact with proteins that control nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization, including RanGAP1 (Freibaum et al., 2015, Jovicic et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2016, Woerner et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2016, Shi et al., 2017). In addition, the crucial mRNA export factor Gle1 (Watkins et al., 1998) can affect toxicity in flies expressing C9ORF72 hexanucleotide-repeats (Freibaum et al., 2015), is mutated in rare cases of ALS (Kaneb et al., 2015), and has been associated with severity in a congenital motor neuron disease (Coyne et al., 2015). Hence, accumulating evidence supports an emerging disease mechanism, in which repeat expansion and cellular aging progressively impair nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

Mice

R6/2 and HttQ175

HttQ175 mice were described earlier (Menalled et al., 2012) and were provided by CHDI foundation (CHDI-81003003) and maintained on C57BL/6 background. Males and females heterozygous for the expanded allele were bred together to obtain a colony of wild-type, heterozygous and homozygous animals; CAG repeats were maintained between 160–190.

R6/2 mice (Mangiarini et al., 1996) were obtained from Jackson laboratories and maintained by crossing transgene positive males with F1 (CBA x C57BL/6) females; CAG repeats were maintained between 120–145.

For both strains, males were perfused in a 20% paraformaldehyde solution and the tissue collected for imaging. Maintenance and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Diego.

Cell lines

Human Neuronal Progenitors

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (Consortium, 2012) were cultured on Matrigel coated (BD Biosciences) 6-well plates in mTeSR 1 media (STEMCELL Technologies) in a 37°C incubator at 5% CO2 with fresh-media changes (2.5mL/well) every day. To obtain human neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) populations, human iPS lines were differentiated following standardized STEMdiff™ NIM method (STEMCELL Technologies) following manufacturer’s instructions. In short, single cell suspensions of human iPS cells were prepared by harvesting individual iPS colonies using ACCUTASE™ (STEMCELL Technologies) and re-suspending in STEMdiff™ neural induction media (supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632). Total cell counts and viability were determined using the Countess Automated Cell Counter (ThermoFisher Scientific).

For initiation of uniform sized embryoid body formations, 3 million cells/mL in a single cell suspension was plated for each human iPS population in independent wells of an AggreWell800 plate (STEMCELL Technologies), resulting in approximately 10,000 single cells/micro-well. The resulting neural aggregates were incubated in neural induction media for four days with daily 1mL/well media changes. Mature embryoid bodies were harvested on day 5 and plated on PLO/Laminin coated 6-well plates and cultured for additional 7 days in neural induction media. The fidelity of the neural rosette formation from each embryoid body was checked over the course of the next 7 days. On day 12, high fidelity neural rosettes were harvested through individual neural rosette selection and replated onto Matrigel coated 6-well plates for further neuronal progenitor population expansion in NPC media. The neuronal progenitor populations were maintained in NPC media.

Additional information is provided in Table S1.

METHOD DETAILS

Mice surgery and tissue preservation

Anesthetized animals were subjected to transcardial perfusion with ice-cold Sorenson’s phosphate buffer (SPB), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffer (PBS). Brains were removed, trimmed with coronal cuts immediately rostral to the forebrain, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 23h, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in HistoPrep (TM) (SH75-125D, Fisher Chemical) followed by a rapid incubation in −40°C 2-Methylbutane (Fisher Scientific), and kept at −80°C. Fixed brains were cut using the Leica 2800E Frigocut cryostat at −20°C. 35 μm thick free-floating sections were preserved in PBS containing Sodium Azide (0.02%) at 4°C.

For RNA FISH experiments, the 10-μm thick sections were immediately mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after sectioning, and preserved in dry ice.

For an experiment shown in Figure 4A (R6/2), paraffin-embedded sections of 10 μm thickness prepared by UCSD histology core were used.

Immunofluorescence (free-floating OCT-embedded sections)

The sections were washed in PBS (3 times, 5 minutes each), permeabilized and blocked in a PBS/0.3% Tween 20/1.5% BSA for one hour at room temperature, followed by an overnight incubation with the primary antibody diluted in a PBS/0.2% TritonX100 solution at room temperature. Next, sections were washed in PBS (3 times, 10 minutes each) and incubated with the secondary antibody (diluted in PBS) for one hour, washed twice with PBS (10 minutes each), and then incubated for 10 minutes with PBS/DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 100ng/ml) solution. To quench autofluorescence, sections were incubated with 0.1% Sudan Black/70% EtOH for 1 minute, and then washed twice briefly with PBS. Sections were mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Immunofluorescence (paraffin-embedded sections)

Immunofluorescence of paraffin-embedded sections for an experiment shown in Figure 4A (R6/2) and Figures 1G, 2C and 4E (Human) was performed as following: CitriSol (Thermo Fisher Scientific)-treated sections were incubated in 100% EtOH, 90% EtOH and dH2O, permeabilized in 0.2% TritonX100/PBS, followed by antigen retrieval and blocking with 2% FBS/0.2% TritonX100/PBS. Then sections were incubated with Anti-Huntingtin Protein Antibody, clone mEM48 (1:500), RanGAP1 Antibody (H-180, sc-25630) (1:500) and lamin B1 Antibody (S-20 sc-30264) (1:5000) diluted in 2% FBS/PBS overnight at 4°C and, after additional washing and blocking steps, incubated with Goat anti Rabbit Alexa488, Invitrogen, A11008, (1:500) antibody, diluted in PBS for 1h at room temperature. Following incubations with 0.01% DAPI and 0.1% Sudan Black/70% EtOH, sections were washed with PBS and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Immunofluorescence (human neuronal progenitors)

For immunofluorescence, human neuronal progenitors were grown on Matrigel coated 6-well plates in a 37°C incubator at 5% CO2 with fresh media changes every third day. NPCs were harvested using TrypLE Express (GIBCO), re-suspended in fresh NPC media, and plated onto Matrigel coated 96-well glass bottom plate (PerkinElmer) at a total cell density of 20,000 cells/well. One day later, cells were washed once with PBS to remove residual media and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Tousimis) in PBS for 20 minute at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minute at room temperature. Cells were washed twice again with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine albumin in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-laminB1 antibody (Proteintech 12987-1-AP) at 1:500, anti-RanGAP1 (H-180, sc-25630) at 1:500), at the indicated dilution in the blocking solution supplemented with 0.02% Tween-20 and incubated at room temperature on a rocking platform (BellCo Technologies) for 2 hours. Appropriate fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa488/Alexa595 (ThermoFisher Scientific) were incubated for 30 minute at room temperature in the blocking buffer. The nuclei were stained sequentially using Hoechst 33342 dye (Life Technologies) at 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 15 minute at room temperature. The cells were washed finally with PBS twice and kept in PBS for imaging analysis.

Antibodies

The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence experiments: Anti-Huntingtin Protein Antibody, clone mEM48, MAB-5374, Millipore (1:500); lamin B1 Antibody (S-20), sc-30264, Santa Cruz (1:5000); lamin B1 Antibody, 12987-1-AP, Proteintech (1:500); RanGAP1 Antibody (H-180), sc-25630, Santa Cruz (1:500); Anti-GLE1 antibody (ab96007), Abcam (1:200); Anti-phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139) Antibody, clone JBW301, Millipore (1:500). Secondary antibodies include: Donkey anti Mouse Cy3, Jackson immunology, 715-165-151, (1:500); Goat anti Rabbit Alexa488, Invitrogen, A11008, (1:500); Donkey anti Goat Alexa488, Invitrogen, A11055, (1:500).

RNA Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

All hybridization steps were performed under RNase-free conditions. Brain OCT frozen sections (10 μm) were dried for 10 min at 60°C. Paraffin-embedded sections (from human autopsies) were washed with xylene and EtOH (100% and 70%) for deparaffinization and with water for hydration, followed by antigen retrieval. Then, samples were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X100/PBS for 10 min at room temperature and blocked (at 60°C for 1 h) with hybridization buffer (50% formamide, saline-sodium citrate (SSC, 2x), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 10% dextran sulfate, and 2 mM vanadyl sulfate ribonucleosides). The sections were then hybridized with 5’-labelled Cy3-(d)T20 oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) (200 mM) for 1h/overnight at 37°C or 60°C. After hybridization, slides were washed in 0.1% Tween-20/2xSCC for 5 min (at room temperature) and three times (10 min each) in 0.1x SSC at 65°C. Autofluorescence was quenched by 0.25% SudanBlack B/70% ethanol and cell nuclei were stained with DAPI.

Image acquisition

Images were acquired with Nikon Eclipse laser scanning confocal microscope with Nikon C2 power device, using the Nikon EZ-C2 software. Brain sections were imaged with 100X, 60X and 20X objectives.

For Z-stacks acquired at 100X, 3 μm thick layers were imaged by taking 30 consecutive images (0.1μm Z-step). Z-projections were generated with the standard deviation Z-projection algorithm using ImageJ-based open-source Fiji software package.

For Z-stacks, acquired at 20X, 15 μm thick layers were imaged by taking 10 consecutive images (1.5 μm Z-step), and Z-projections were generated as mentioned above.

For human iPS-derived neuronal progenitors immunofluorescence analysis, 40X images were acquired on IN Cell Analyzer 6000 Cell Imaging System (laser based confocal imaging platform from GE Healthcare Life Sciences). For lamin B1 and RanGAP1 based nuclear morphology analysis, 10 random Fields of View (FOVs) spread evenly across the entire surface of each well of a 96-well plate were captured for each cell line. Multiple independent wells for each cell lines were analyzed.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All quantitative analyses relied on systematic uniform random sampling.

A. Nuclear Envelope shape (lamin B1 staining)

We defined 2 types of NE morphology (Figure S1B):

normal, where nuclear lamina is characterized by a predominantly round and regular shape;

altered, with moderate or severe alterations, an irregular shape of nuclear lamina with several invaginations or protrusions.

100–400 cells (cortex) and 300–700 cells (striatum) from at least 2 animals per each genotype and age were analyzed.

B. PolyQ Huntingtin aggregates

PolyQ Htt aggregates were quantified manually per cell. Lamin B1 and DAPI staining were used to address nuclear/extranuclear polyQ Htt localization on images acquired with a 100X objective. 200 cells for each genotype and age were counted.

C. DNA Double Strand breaks

Thresholds for γH2AX and DAPI signals were defined using Nikon Elements software, and new binary layers containing both signals were generated. γH2AX foci number and areas were quantified using Nikon Elements or FIJI IMAGEJ software. 100–200 cells per animal were counted.

D. Gle1/PolyQ Htt and RanGAP1/PolyQ Htt co-localization in nuclei

Nuclear PolyQ Htt aggregates within 3 μm Z stacks (100x magnification, 30 consecutive images, 0.1μm Z-step) were analyzed for the presence of Gle1 or RanGAP1 signals. Aggregates were considered “co-localized”, if co-localizing Gle1 and PolyQ Htt signals or RanGAP1 and PolyQ Htt signals formed distinct spots, observed in any of corresponding channels: PolyQ Htt and Gle1, or PolyQ Htt and RanGAP1 respectively. Nuclear localization was defined by DAPI. At least 100 cells from at least 2 animals were analyzed for each genotype and age.

E. RanGAP1 perinuclear accumulation

20x images were analyzed. Cells, positive or negative for perinuclear accumulated RanGAP1 were counted manually (at least 600 cells per animal were analyzed).

RanGAP1 alterations in the human neuronal progenitor cells were determined by the detection of RanGAP1 positive nuclear invaginations. Nuclear RanGAP1 was first defined by overlaying Hoechst 33342 dye based nuclear area masks to segment individual nuclei. Each segmented nucleus was then scored for the presence or absence of RanGAP1 intensity based nuclear invagination. For automated detection, nuclear invaginations were defined as unilateral spikes in per pixel intensity forming a high intensity protrusion extending inwards from the periphery (outlined by Hoechst 33342 dye based individual nuclear perimeter) of a given nucleus. For obtaining percent of cells with nuclear invagination, cells from each Field of View were combined to take a ratio of total number of nuclei scored positive over the total number of nuclei measured. Multiple wells with 10 fields of views per well were analyzed for each cell line. At least 5000 cells per cell lines were analyzed.

F. PolyA RNA distribution

60x-100x images were analyzed. Using Acapella software (Perkin Elmer), cells were segmented by first identifying nuclei based on Dapi, and then cytoplasm based on PolyA RNA. Mean intensities of nuclear and cytoplasmic PolyA RNA signals were determined for each cell. Ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic signal intensities is shown in Figure 2B. 300–600 cells were analyzed from mice of following genotypes and ages: 24 month-old HttQ7/Q7 (n=3), 24 month-old HttQ7/Q175 (n=3), 24 month-old HttQ175/Q175 (n=3), 3 month-old R6/2 (n=1).

Quantification of cells with nuclear or nuclear/cytoplasmic RNA localization in human autopsy samples was performed manually by a blinded investigator; counting the cells that presented polyA signal only in the nucleus (nuclear mRNA accumulation) or in the nucleus &amp; cytoplasm (100x magnification, 30 consecutive images, 0.1μm Z-step). 150 cells were counted.

G. Human Nuclear Envelope shape (lamin B1 staining)

Nuclear envelope morphology was examined manually in lamin B1 positive cells. 3 μm Z stacks images (100x magnification, 30 consecutive images, 0.1μm Z-step) were analyzed. 100 cells were counted per subject.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. All data are shown as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The statistical significance of the differences between two groups was investigated by unpaired t test or by chi-square test with Yates’ correction. Statistical tests are indicated in each figure legend along with the corresponding significance level (p value). The number of cells analyzed per experiment is provided in the corresponding figure legends.
