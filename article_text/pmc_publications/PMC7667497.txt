Extracellular vesicle (EV) is a unified terminology of membrane-enclosed vesicular species ubiquitously secreted by almost every cell type and present in all body fluids. They carry a cargo of lipids, metabolites, nucleic acids and proteins for their clearance from cells as well as for cell-to-cell communications. The exact composition of EVs and their specific functions are not well understood due to the underdevelopment of the separation protocols, especially those from the central nervous system including animal and human brain tissues as well as cerebrospinal fluids, and the low yield of proteins in the separated EVs. To understand their exact molecular composition and their functional roles, development of the reliable protocols for EV separation is necessary. Here we report the methods for EV separation from human and mouse unfixed frozen brain tissues by a sucrose step gradient ultracentrifugation method, and from human cerebrospinal fluids by an affinity capture method. The separated EVs were assessed for morphological, biophysical and proteomic properties of separated EVs by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and labeled and label-free mass-spectroscopy for protein profiling with step-by-step protocols for each assessment.

1. Introduction

Extracellular vesicles (EV) include exosomes (50–150nm), which are secreted into the extracellular space after fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with plasma membrane; ectosomes/microvesicles (150–1000nm), which are shed from plasma membrane; and apoptotic bodies (1000–5000nm), which are generated from apoptotic cells. EVs are produced by almost all cell types in the central nervous system [1–3]. EVs contain many species of nucleic acids (microRNA, ncRNA, mRNA, DNA among others), lipids, and proteins that can be transferred to recipient cells as a form of cell-to-cell communication [4–10]. Several proteins are reported as markers for exosomes, such as tetraspanin protein (CD9, CD63 and CD81), syntenin-1, TSG101, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II [11,12]. In comparison, markers for microvesicles include glycoprotein 1b, actinin-4, heat shock protein (HSP) 90B1, mitofilin, and myosin light chain [11–14]. EVs are found in all body fluids, including blood, urine, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [15,16]. EVs have been extensively investigated by liquid biopsy modality for diagnosis as well as therapeutic vehicles for drug delivery especially in cancer fields, but much less in the neuroscience field [17–21]. We are, however, still in an infancy stage for standardizing the protocols for the separation of EVs from animal and human biospecimens [1,22]. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) members published a guideline on Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV) in 2014 [22], which was updated in 2018 [1]. In the MISEV2018 guideline, they classified the EV separation protocols into four categories based on recovery and specificity, and created a checklist to demonstrate the EV nature and the degree of purity of an EV preparation. Standardization of these protocols for efficient recovery of EVs with a high purity from biological samples, however, has not been achieved yet. In the past 10 years, there has been expanded investigation of physiological and pathological functions of EVs from cell culture or biospecimen. In addition, these studies have focused on EVs in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease, Prion disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is now known that brain derived-EVs contain pathogenic proteins, such as tau, amyloid beta (Aβ), superoxide dismutase, transactive response DNA binding protein 43kDa (TDP-43) and α-synuclein [15,23–27]. These EVs interestingly contribute to the cell-to-cell propagation of the disease [23,25,28,29]. EVs containing pathogenic proteins are also detectable in CSF, serum, and plasma from patients with neurodegenerative diseases [30–35]. Investigation of the brain-derived EV cargo, therefore, is important to further understand the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the CSF, serum, and plasma-derived EVs are also of particular interest as liquid biopsy samples for diagnosing and monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this report, we describe step-by-step protocols for the assessment of morphological, biophysical and proteomic properties of separated EVs by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis and mass-spectroscopy.

Procedure:

3.1.1. Dissection of unfixed human and mouse frozen brain tissues

Transfer 0.5g of unfixed frozen brain tissue to plastic petri dish on ice

Add 1mL of ice-cold Hibernate E solution to plastic petri dish

Chop the brain tissue on ice using a razor blade to generate 0.5mm3 sections

Note: In this protocol, 0.5g of frozen human cortical grey matter or whole frozen mouse brain tissue is used per sample.

Transfer the section samples to 15-mL centrifuge tubes and add Hibernate E solution containing 20 units of Papain in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) up to 3mL

Note: Enzymes such as papain, collagenase, and trypsin are commonly used for dissection. The enzyme should be selected with subsequent analysis.

Incubate in a water bath at 37°C for 15 min by stirring once every 5 min

Place immediately on ice and add 6mL of ice-cold Hibernate E with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails (1:100)

Homogenize gently the dissociated brain tissue samples (20 strokes) with a glass-Teflon homogenizer

Note: This homogenate step may need to utilize a Dounce homogenizer (loose pestle) or no homogenizer to distinguish intracellular vesicle from extracellular vesicle for subsequent analysis.

Filtrate the homogenized tissue samples with sterile nylon mesh filter (40-μm pore size) to new 50-mL tube

3.1.2. Differential centrifugation

Centrifuge the tissue samples at 300 × g for 10 min at 4°C using 5720R from Eppendorf

Note: This pellet contains cell debris and nucleus.

Transfer the supernatant to new 15-mL tube

Centrifuge at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C using 5720R from Eppendorf

Note: This pellet contains apoptotic bodies and microsomes.

Transfer the supernatant to polycarbonate bottles or 1.5-mL tube

Centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C using Avanti J-E JA25–50 from Beckman Coulter or 5430R from Eppendorf

Note: This pellet contains Large EVs (microvesicles) and plasma membranes.

Filtrate the supernatant through a PES membrane filter (0.22-μm pore size) into a new polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube with 13.2-mL capacity

Add ice-cold Hibernate E with Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails up to 12.5mL

Centrifuge at 140,000 × g for 70 min at 4°C using Optima-XE SW41 from Beckman Coulter

Note: Since the high-speed ultracentrifugation can induce the formation of EV aggregates, EV aggregation may be prevented by cushioning 1mL of 1.0M sucrose on the tube bottom.

3.1.3. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation

After ultracentrifugation (3.1.2.- Step 8), the supernatant is completely discarded, and pellets are resuspended in 2mL of 0.475M of sucrose solution

Create the sucrose step gradient with six 2-mL steps starting from 2.0M to 1.5M, 1.0M, 0. 825M, 0.65M, and 0.475M (containing the resuspended pellet) in a polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube

Note: These sucrose solutions were colored with commercially available food coloring to facilitate capture of the EV-rich interphase present between certain steps (Please see Figure 1).

Centrifuge at 200,000 × g (35,000 rpm) for 20 h at 4°C using Optima-XE SW41 from Beckman Coulter

Collect in 2mL fractions, except for the first and last fractions, which are 1mL each.

Note: Fraction “III” corresponds to the 1mL removed from the tube, and particles in this area had a buoyant density of approximately 1.08 g/cm3. The area between the first (0.475M) and second (0.650M) step is collected and corresponded to fraction “VI” with a buoyant density of 1.08 – 1.10 g/cm3, while the area between the second (0.650M) and third (0.825M) steps is collected and correspond to fraction “V” with a buoyant density of 1.10 – 1.12 g/cm3, and the interphase between the third (0.825M) and fourth (1.000M) steps correspond to fraction “VI” with a buoyant density of 1.12 – 1.15 g/cm3. Interphase between the fourth (1.000M) and fifth (1.500M) steps, fraction VII; between the fifth (1.500M) and sixth (2.000M) steps, fraction VIII; and the 1mL remaining in the tube, fraction IX (please see Figure 1). The fractions V and VI (1.10 – 1.15 g/cm3) are EV-rich fractions.

Dilute the V and VI fractions separately to a total volume of 12.5mL with dfPBS in a polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube

Centrifuge at 140,000 × g for 70 min at 4°C using Optima-XE SW41 from Beckman Coulter

Discard the supernatant and resuspend the final pellet from each fraction in 30μL of dfPBS

3.1.4. Size exclusion chromatography (qEV original column)

Equilibrate the qEV original column with at least 30mL of dfPBS buffer

Note: Allow to come to room temperature.

After ultracentrifugation (3.1.2.-step 8), the supernatant is completely discarded, and the pellet is resuspended in 1000μL of dfPBS. Mix by vortexing

Load the 1000μL of the vortexed sample to the qEV original column

Add in 3.0mL minus the initial sample volume of dfPBS to top of the column

Note: Don’t load more than 2.0mL at a time. The first 6 fractions (3mL) do not contain vesicles (fraction 1–6).

Add 500μL of dfPBS at a time to top of the column

Note: It collect this completely in a tube, and then add 500μL more for the next fraction.

Collect 5 vesicle fractions of 500μL of each (fraction 7–11)

Note: It is recommended to measure the particle number and protein concentration of those fractions. EVs elute predominantly into fractions 7, 8 and 9 with removal of ~99.8% of bulk proteins. If higher purity is desired, collect only the earliest peak fraction (fraction 7 and 8).

3.2. Protocols for separation of EVs from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

Materials and Methods

Reagents:

Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen

Note: Postmortem CSF specimens (1.0mL, 37 years old female, PMI 9h, pre-screened for infectious diseases, no previous cycle of freezing and thawing) were obtained from University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank and stored at −80°C. For identification of 700 EV proteins using 1D-LC-MS/MS (Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive with Waters NanoAcquity UPLC), at least 500μL of human CSF is needed to collect EVs (1.6 × 1010 particles / mL). The sample volume should be empirically optimized for this purpose.

4. Results

4.1. Biochemical characterization of EVs separated from unfixed frozen human brain tissue by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation method

The experimental workflow is summarized in Figure 1A and B. The EVs were separated from unfixed frozen human brain tissue using the discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (SG-UC) method. EVs were analyzed for protein concentration using protein assay (BCA), particle size and number using Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), which determines the size of suspended particles based on their Brownian motion, particle form using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and protein profiling using Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics analysis. The EVs separated from frozen brain tissue was observed cap-sharped morphology by TEM (Figure 1C). Table 1 shows the protein concentration of collected fractions. The fraction VIII and XI were below the detection limit of protein assay. Figure 2A shows the NTA plot of these fractions (tissue homogenate, pellet at 10,000g, and sucrose fraction-III, IV, V, VI, and VII). The tissue homogenate and pellet at 10,000g fractions represented a broad distribution of vesicle with several peaks (asterisk), but the sucrose fraction-V and VI was decreased to a few peaks by SG-UC. The results suggest the EV fraction could separate EV of the same or nearly same size from heterogenous size vesicles of brain tissue by buoyant density. In addition, fractions V and VI (1.10 – 1.15 g/cm3) are the EV fraction in which concentrated EV particles compared to tissue homogenate (Table 1). To check the protein profiling in these fractions, we performed the 10-plex TMT-based quantitative proteomics analysis for the brain tissue homogenates and the separated fractions. We found that these EV fractions were enriched in tetraspanins including CD9 and CD81, annexins, and lysosomal markers such as Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) as compared to tissue homogenates, and diminished in non-EV molecules such as Histone H1 from nucleus, 10kDa heat shock protein (HSPE1) from mitochondria, calnexin from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Ras-related protein Rab-2A (RAB2A) from the Golgi apparatus, as listed in MISEV2018 guidelines [1] (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 1). In addition, these identified proteins were tested by Gene Ontology analysis in The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [37,38] for properties pertaining to the ‘cellular component’ (Figure 2C). The EV fraction separated by the SG-UC method was enriched in the Extracellular exosome category. These data indicate that EVs were successfully separated from unfixed frozen brain tissue using discontinuous SG-UC method.

4.2. Comparison of unfixed murine brain-derived EVs separated via sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography methods

Using the SG-UC protocol, we found that the small vesicles corresponding to exosome size (50–150nm) are also present in other sucrose fractions as determined by NTA (Table 1). These fractions also contain EV markers including CD9 and CD81 as determined by proteomic profiling. To collect these EVs as they migrated into fractions other than V and VI, we decided to test alternative methods instead of the SG-UC. We separated EVs from mouse brain tissue by size exclusion chromatography (SEC method; qEV original column). The SEC method can separate the soluble molecules, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (5–12 nm), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (18–25 nm), and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) (25–35 nm) from EV fractions [39]. We compared the EV separation methods based on the particle size, particle counts, protein yield, and proteomic profiling (Figure 3). The particle size and number of separated EVs was determined by NTA, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA (Figure 4A, B and Table 2). The EVs separated via the SEC method had fractions 8 and 9 as the EV fractions. The SEC method had higher EV particle numbers and protein yield compared to the SG-UC method (Table 2). The SEC method, however, showed a broad distribution of vesicles with several peaks (asterisk) as compared to the SG-UC method (Figure 4A and B). In addition, TEM imaging was shown that the EVs separated by the SEC method contain differently sized vesicles, such as small and medium size particles compared to SG-UC method (Figure 3). In addition, a label-free Nano-LC-MS/MS analysis of these EV samples identified 933 and 1823 proteins in the EVs separated by SG-UC and SEC, respectively (Table 2). The SEC method separated EVs were enriched in molecules such as tetraspanins including CD9, CD81 and CD82, and ESCRT proteins including programmed cell death 6-interactting protein (PDCD6IP; Alix) and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS) as compared to the SG-UC method. However, the non-EV molecules, such as MICOS complex subunit MIC60 (IMMT), calnexin, and Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone Bip (BIP) were also detected. This suggests that separated populations may contain overlap of multiple EV sub-species. These identified proteins in the EV samples were tested by DAVID GO analysis for properties pertaining to the ‘cellular component’ (Figure 4C). Both EV fractions separated by SG-UC and SEC methods were enriched the Extracellular exosome category. The SEC method, however, also enriched mitochondrion category as non-EV molecules. The SG-UC method has disadvantage in work time and sample size per run, but it could recover small EVs of the same size with the highest enrichment between two methods (Table 2).

4.3. Characterization of EVs separated from human CSF by affinity capture method

To create the protein profiling of CSF-derived EVs, we separated EVs from CSF by affinity capture (AC method; MagCapture Exosome Isolation kit), which can also separate them from EV fractions by capturing with phosphatidylserine [40], and analyzed the secondary collected EVs by NTA and proteome analysis. The experimental workflow is summarized in Figure 5.

The particle size and number of separated EV were determined by NTA, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA (Figure 6A and Table 3). In addition, the separated EVs from CSF was showed classical EV morphology by TEM (Figure 5). The AD methods could successfully separate and concentrate EV of the same or nearly same size from human CSF (Table 3). Nano-LC-MS/MS-based protein profiling of the CSF-derived EVs identified a total of 700 unique proteins. The EV molecules such as tetraspanin and ESCRT, including PDCD6IP/Alix and syntenin-1 proteins could enrich in the EV fraction separated by AC method.

In addition, the EV fraction was enriched in Extracellular exosome molecules as determined by DAVID GO (Figure 6B). These results show that this EV separation method may be effective for separating EVs from biospecimens of limited availability for proteomic analysis. We have also separated the EV by UC and SEC method for LC-MS/MS, but we could not collect enough EV for proteomics analysis and the proteins mostly could not be identified.

5. Discussion

Here we described our recently established protocols for the separation of EVs from biospecimens with a specific focus on unfixed brain tissues and CSF. In the past decade, investigation of EV function in neurodegenerative diseases have expanded, and given rise to the need to separate high purity EVs from biospecimens to understand the role of EVs in progression of those diseases, as well as develop the biomarkers for monitoring and diagnostic of progression of those diseases. Previously, the protocols for separation of EV from brain tissues by sucrose or iodixanol density gradient ultracentrifugation have been reported [24–26,41]. Gonzalez et al has described the protocol to enrich EVs from frozen and fresh brain tissues by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation for the first time, and shown that the EVs separated from APP transgenic mouse brain tissue are contained neuropathogenic molecule such as full length APP, APP C-terminal fragments and amyloid-β peptide [24]. Hurwitz et al. described the technique for the enrichment of brain-derived EV by iodixanol sedimentation and flotation gradient based isolation techniques [26]. They showed the purity of EVs with less contaminating debris by iodixanol flotation density isolation as compared to sedimentation gradient isolation, along with the utility of this method in downstream proteomic analysis. The comparison of two isolation techniques, however, were not normalized by the total spectral counting in label-free proteomics.

In addition, non-specific EV protein HSC70 was detected in both sedimentation- and flotation-density gradient isolation by western blotting. Thus, we think that there is no obvious difference between sedimentation and flotation-based isolation techniques. Vella et al has reported a protocol to separate small EVs from human frontal cortical tissues using a triple sucrose cushion without homogenization and filtration [41]. The homogenization and filtration may reduce the purity of EVs by causing cell disruption and release of intracellular vesicles such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. In addition, they utilized collagenase type III to dissociate cells from these tissues, and minimize cell disruption. The separated EV fraction without the cell disruption was enriched in proteins related to the exosome biogenesis, the endosomal pathway and endosomal trafficking pathways, and less contamination non-EV molecules. Our method separated EVs from human unfixed brain tissue by papain dissociation, homogenization with standard tissue grinder and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The separated EV fractions are enriched with tetraspanins and ESCRT proteins as compared to tissue homogenates, and less contamination of non-EV molecules such as the nucleus, mitochondria, ER, Golgi-related proteins by TMT-based the proteomics dataset (Figure 2 B and Supplementary Table 1). On other hand, the EV fraction was also enriched myelin sheath-related molecules compared to published proteomics datasets for separation of brain EVs. This result suggests that the EVs separated by this method contained myelin related protein and lipid, presumably from oligodendrocytes [42,43]. In our proteomics data, CD9 and CD81 were also detected in fraction III (1.06 – 1.08 g/cm3), IV (1.08 – 1.10 g/cm3) and VII (1.15 – 1.18 g/cm3). In addition, small EVs were observed in fraction III and IV by NTA, when DTT was added to the EV fraction to dissociate aggregated EVs. Based on the findings, fraction VII may contain the large EVs and aggregated EVs generated by ultracentrifugation [44]. The fraction III and IV, on the other hand, may contain small EVs, LDL, IDL or HDL [39,45]. We separated brain-derived EVs using the SEC method instead of SG-UC after ultracentrifugation because the SEC method can avoid EVs from SG-UC-related aggregation, and could separate EVs from soluble proteins, HDL, LDL and IDL [46], which were frequently contaminated in EVs separated by the DC-UC or SG-UC methods [47–50]. Several reports, however, have shown SEC method failed to separate soluble proteins, apolipoproteins, HDL and LDL from EVs [51–59]. This could be due to the pooling of fractions from 7 to 9 or 10 in those studies. If fractions 7 to 8 or 9 were used, according to manufacturer’s instructions, this could be avoided. The SEC methods can collect more EVs and identify more EV marker molecules than SG-UC method in our study. The SEC method, however, also enriched in non-EV molecules (such as mitochondrion category) and contained more particles at various sizes than conventional EV size of around 100 nm compared to the SG-UC method (Figure 3 and 4). Thus, we suggest that SG-UC method is suitable for EV proteomic analysis. However, the sucrose cushion should be used for ultracentrifugation before SG-UC to avoid aggregation of EVs. In summary, we could collect 166μg of EVs from 0.5g of frozen human cortical grey matter or whole frozen mouse brain tissue using our separation protocol for brain-derived EV. The protein yield is sufficient for NTA, protein assay, TEM, western blot and proteomic profiling by mass-spectroscopy (Table 1 and 2).

Previously, protocols for separation of EVs from human CSF using ultracentrifugation, high-resolution flow cytometric sorting or size exclusion chromatography in downstream proteomic analysis have been reported [30,60–66]. Chiasserini et al have reported the EV were separated from 6mL of human CSF by ultracentrifugation and a sucrose cushion, and they represent the largest and most comprehensive dataset by proteomics analysis [61]. The separated EVs were highly enriched with the brain cell-type specific molecules and EV molecules such as the Alix, syntenin, and Rab proteins. This method, however, needs a very large volumes of CSF per sample and lengthy procedure lasting 16–24 h. This is unsuitable for scaling up larger population of the human study. Pieragostino et al on the other hand, reported EVs could be directly separated from 100μ of CSF using high-resolution flow cytometry sorting, and characterized the protein profiling of EVs by mass spectrometry [63]. This method, if reproducible, could be suitable for the larger clinical studies and can avoids any preparation steps, which may reduce the yield. One caveat is that the size of CSF-derived EVs is in the range 333–1326 nm, which we didn’t observe in our TEM study of CSF-derived EVs. The actual size of FACS-isolated EVs should be independently validated. The AC method can separate small EVs compared with FACS and does not require large volume of CSF samples. In our proteomics data, the AC method could enrich EV molecules such as tetraspanins and ESCRT proteins, but serum proteins such as an albumin and apolipoprotein were also identified. This is minor contamination, as Patel et al reported that EVs separated from culture media by the AC method were of good quality to remove the serum protein contamination for proteomic analysis [52]. In summary, using the AC method, high purity EVs can be separated from as low as 500 μL of CSF within 5 h for proteomics profiling (Table 3). In addition, multiple clinical samples (20–30 samples) can be processed at one time.

In conclusion, it is important to develop protocol standard operation procedure for EV separation from brain tissue and CSF samples for future development of EV-based diagnostics, and to investigate the biological function for progression of neurodegenerative disorders using a large volume of human biospecimens. The protocols we provided for separation of EVs from unfixed brain tissue and CSF samples and mass spectroscopy as a downstream application may respond to the urgent unmet needs.
