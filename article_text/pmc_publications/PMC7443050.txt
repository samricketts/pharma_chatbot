Despite the vast heterogeneity of amyloid plaques isolated from the brains of those with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the basis of the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) targets a single peptide, the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. The countless therapeutic efforts targeting the production and aggregation of this specific peptide have been met with disappointment, leaving many to question the role of Aβ in AD. An alternative cleavage product of the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein (AβPP), called the p3 peptide, which has also been isolated from the brains of AD patients, has been largely absent from most Aβ-related studies. Typically referred to as non-amyloidogenic and even suggested as neuroprotective, the p3 peptide has garnered little attention aside from some conflicting findings on cytotoxicity and potential self-assembly to form higher order aggregates. Herein, we report an extensive analysis of the findings surrounding p3 and offer some evidence as to why it may not be as innocuous as previously suggested.

BACKGROUND ON ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a debilitating, neurological disease responsible for an annual worldwide financial burden of over $818 billion US dollars [1]. While a definitive cause of the disease remains elusive, even in lieu of successive drug trial failures, significant evidence still supports the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH). The basis of the ACH is that an intrinsically disordered protein, called amyloid-β (Aβ), aggregates to form intermediate, soluble oligomers, and eventually late-stage, insoluble fibrils that accumulate in the brains of patients, eventually leading to dementia [2,3]. While the Alzheimer’s brain is riddled with plaques rich in Aβ fibrils, substantial evidence points to the metastable oligomers as the neurotoxic species of Aβ responsible for cognitive decline [3–6].

The processing of the Amyloid-β Precursor Protein (AβPP) occurs via two main enzymatic routes (Fig. 1): the amyloidogenic pathway and an alternative pathway, commonly referred to as “non-amyloidogenic”. In the amyloidogenic pathway, AβPP is cleaved by β- and γ- secretases to produce Aβ. Alternatively, in the “non-amyloidogenic pathway”, AβPP is cleaved by α- rather than β-secretase to produce an N-truncated version of Aβ, called p3 (Aβ (17–40/42) or p3 (17–40/42)) (Fig. 1B). The p3-producing pathway is thought to be favored, as p3 is released from cultured neurons approximately 2-fold more frequently than Aβ [7]. While most consider the p3-producing pathway to be neuroprotective given that it precludes the production of Aβ, little is known about the biological and biophysical properties of p3. Despite this, upon employing a web-based software for the prediction of aggregation-prone regions of polypeptides [8], we found that 100% of the predicted “hot spots” calculated for Aβ (1–42) were found within the p3 region (residues 17–42) (Fig. 1A). It begs the question as to why further studies have not been conducted to understand whether or not p3 plays a pathogenic role in AD.

SUCCESSIVE DRUG TRIAL FAILURES

Due to the strong link between Aβ levels and cognitive dysfunction, many therapeutic efforts have aimed to reduce Aβ levels in the brain, either by targeting Aβ directly, or indirectly through intervention into enzymatic processing of AβPP [9,10]. To date, most treatments aimed to cure Alzheimer’s Disease have failed Phase III clinical trials [9], aside from Biogen’s recent revisited analysis of the anti-amyloid antibody drug, aducanumab, that is currently seeking FDA approval [11]. Moreover, current treatments for AD symptoms include cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists [12]. These successive failures have led many to question the relevance of the Aβ with respect to disease treatment [13]. In fact, several β-secretase inhibitors have actually made patients cognitively worse when compared with the placebo groups [9,14–16], indicating that a new approach is urgently needed. Ultimately, AD is a complex disease that will likely require a treatment that is multifaceted in nature. Since Aβ is an intrinsically disordered protein, it can form a diverse landscape of aggregates with varied morphologies and toxicities, making it exceptionally difficult to target with therapeutics [17–19]. In addition, a factor rarely considered in drug design is the heterogeneity of amyloid plaques [20–23]. Proteomic studies have revealed that amyloid plaques isolated from the brains of patients with AD are comprised of on average 913 different proteins, and 279 of these were found consistently in all patients in the study [21]. It is not known what portion of these proteins contribute to plaque formation directly versus proteins that are absorbed at a later point. However, it is clear that Aβ is not the sole contributor to plaque formation.

DEFINING “AMYLOIDOGENIC”

When trying to understand whether p3 should be classified as amyloidogenic, it is important to first define what the term “amyloidogenic” actually means. To provide some historical context, the term “amyloid” was originally implemented by a botanist named Matthias Schleiden in 1838 to describe starch-like structures found in plants [24]. It was later applied to medicine by Rudolf Virchow in 1854 to describe disease-related deposits sensitive to sulfuric acid and iodine staining [25]. Today however, the term is applied more generally to a variety of different disease-related protein deposits, both in and ex vivo in nature. To provide some clarity, the Nomenclature Committee of the International Society of Amyloidosis defines an amyloid as “extracellular deposits of protein fibrils with a characteristic appearance in electron microscopy, a typical X-ray diffraction pattern and an affinity for Congo red with concomitant green birefringence” [26,27]. A thorough analysis of the small body of literature surrounding p3, primarily from the 1990s, reveals conflicting findings on whether p3 fulfills this definition of amyloidogenic.

DEBATE ON THE AMYLOIDOGENIC PROPERTIES OF P3

Presence of p3 in Plaques and CSF

Despite receiving little attention, p3 has been detected in plaques removed from the post mortem brains of patients with AD [23,28–30]. In fact, it has been identified as the major component of Down’s Syndrome diffuse plaques [28], which are thought to precede the formation of mature, senile plaques [31,32]. This is of interest because AβPP is located on chromosome 21, so people with Down’s Syndrome produce excess AβPP, and thus experience plaque deposition beginning in their 30s [33]. People with Down’s Syndrome almost invariably get AD, making the identification of substantial p3 content in plaques seem like an unlikely coincidence. Interestingly, these patients also experience elevated oxidative stress [34]. The finding that p3 is localized in the diffuse plaques may provide a snapshot into the early events of Aβ aggregation, which remain elusive in late-onset AD.

Aside from the handful of studies cited above, p3 is rarely mentioned as a product from brain homogenate extractions. However, this does not necessarily mean that p3 is not present in plaques, but rather that there may be detection limits for p3 that must be overcome. Factors that influence levels of certain isoforms of Aβ in postmortem brains may be antibody sensitivity, extraction protocols and brain extraction locations. Specifically, a commonly used immunohistochemistry antibody, 6E10, binds to amino acids 5–7 on Aβ [35], thus precluding p3 binding. In contrast, 4G8 binds amino acids 17–24 [35], which binds both Aβ and p3 indiscriminately. The use of 4G8 would prevent any distinction between p3 and Aβ, leading to the incorrect assignment of p3 as Aβ. Also, since p3 lacks a hydrophilic region, it is likely that different protocols and buffers are required for its extraction from brain homogenates. It is also unclear what effect the harsh conditions used in plaque purifications, such as high salt concentration, protease treatment and urea, have on the peptides of interest. In addition, unlike Aβ, p3 is devoid of any tyrosine residues, reducing the extinction coefficient at 280 nm, making UV-Vis detection less straightforward for this fragment.

Furthermore, since amyloid plaque deposition occurs in aging, healthy brains without AD symptoms, it has been suggested that clearance of Aβ plays a pivotal role in AD progression [36–39]. Mawuenyega and coworkers found that, compared to cognitively normal controls, patients with AD showed reduced clearance of Aβ from the brain to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [39]. Since p3 has not been implicated in AD, aside from one study that found elevated p3 levels in the CSF of patients with mild cognitive impairment [40], p3 is largely absent from studies on Aβ clearance. This is problematic because p3 (and/or other Aβ isoforms and fragments) may be an essential element to unlocking the Alzheimer’s puzzle, either through its effect on Aβ aggregation or clearance. Perhaps there is a substantial difference in clearance of p3 between healthy controls and demented patients. Or perhaps p3 seeds or sequesters Aβ, resulting in altered clearance rates. Without these data, these critical questions remain unanswered.

Fibril Formation

A discrepancy exists as to whether or not p3 forms amyloid fibrils, or even fibrils at all (Fig. 2). Early publications to explore the fibril forming ability of p3 (17–40/42) presented EM images of what they consistently described to be amorphous aggregates or lattices of dense polymers (Fig 2A–B, 2F) [28,41,42]. These authors noted differences in morphologies as compared with Aβ, such as shorter fibril lengths, narrower diameter and more heterogenous [28,41,42]. However, two of these studies did not provide any images of Aβ for comparison [28,41], making it difficult to assess any differences. Several subsequent publications also published EM images of p3 (17–40/42), but noted less differences other than reduced twisting and a slight irregular morphology (Fig. 2C–E, 2G-I) [43–46]. In each of these studies, drastically different fibril forming conditions were employed, which is not unusual in the field of AD. The concentrations ranged from 5–500 μM, incubation times ranged from 1 hour – 2 weeks, temperatures ranged from 25–37 °C, buffer contents and pH differed, and some samples were shaken while others were kept quiescent. Like Aβ, p3 is an intrinsically disordered protein, and thus will be exceptionally sensitive to assay conditions. Each of these conditions will individually exert effects on the morphologies of any aggregates formed. For example, shaking during fibril formation has been shown to sometimes produce shorter, thicker fragments [47]. Moreover, from these published EM images, it is clear that p3 exhibits fibril-like morphology, but whether or not p3 shares structural characteristics with Aβ is unclear.

p3 lacks the hydrophilic N-terminus of Aβ, leaving behind a peptide comprised to a large degree of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1A). This alone suggests that under aqueous, physiological conditions, p3 should be capable of self-assembly to a higher degree than Aβ. As shown in Fig. 1A, the aggregation-prone regions of Aβ (17–22 and 30–42) are all found in the p3 peptide, as determined by AGGRESCAN [8]. In fact, only a couple of the recently published cryo-EM structures of amyloid fibrils include the presence of the N-terminus as a critical part of the fibril stability [48,49]. Aside from these examples, most published structures of fibrillar Aβ to date omit the N-terminus entirely, or describe it as structurally disordered when compared with the C-terminus [49–51]. In support of this, Tӧrӧk et. al. found via site-directed spin labeling that amino acids 30–40 produce the core region of Aβ fibrils [52].

Moreover, significantly smaller regions of Aβ than p3 have been shown to exhibit amyloidogenic properties. The KVLFF region has been shown to self-assemble to form β-sheet rich, fibrillar species [53,54] and to competitively bind to full-length Aβ [55–57]. Even more surprising, Adler-Abramovich et. al. demonstrated that individual phenylalanine molecules can self-assemble into well-ordered, cytotoxic, disease- relevant, amyloid-like fibrils that exhibit birefringence under polarized light when stained with Congo Red [58]. However, in the context of p3, these findings are typically overlooked.

Absence of Binding Sites to Potential Molecular Chaperones of Aβ in p3

Furthermore, it has been proposed that the following binding partners of Aβ participate in amyloid plaque formation: heparin sulfate proteoglycans, Cu, Al, Fe, Zn, collagen-like Alzheimer’s amyloid plaque component [59]. Many of these are thought to interact with the N-terminus of Aβ [59], which is absent from p3. However, the necessity of the N-terminus of Aβ in the aggregation pathway to form toxic species has been heavily debated since the 1990s [59–61]. Ali et. al. concluded with electrospray mass spectrometry that p3 does not bind Cu2+ at pH 7.2 when compared with Aβ40 [62]. Despite this, Jang et. al. demonstrated that p3 forms ion channels in cell membranes of human cortical neurons, leading to calcium dysregulation and ultimately neurite degeneration [63]. Thus, perhaps even in the absence of the HHQKL region, other hydrophobic regions of p3 are capable of interacting with lipids. Further studies are needed to understand the potential for p3 to interact with the other chaperones of Aβ aggregation.

Structural Characterization of p3

Secondary structure analyses of Aβ and related peptides have revealed that under physiological conditions, they are primarily composed of β-sheets at various states of self-assembly [64]. Circular dichroism and ATR-FTIR studies have revealed predominant β-sheet character for p3 at physiological pH, similar to what has been published for Aβ [41,44,46,62]. Schmechel et. al. [44] and Vandersteen et. al. [46] found that p3 (17–40) and p3 (17–42) had less pronounced β-sheet character, while Pike et. al. [41]. found that the β-sheet content was the same regardless of N-terminus. In contrast, Ali et. al. [62] found that the β-sheet character of p3 (17–40) was substantially enhanced when compared with Aβ40.

Aside from characterizing morphology of fibrils, other techniques commonly used to identify β-sheet rich fibril formation are Thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red. ThT is a small molecule that exhibits a fluorescence enhancement upon binding β-sheet rich fibrils. However, there are certain limitations to the ThT assay including inconsistent fluorescence upon incubation with the Osaka mutation of Aβ [65,66], and the recent finding that ThT can bind a cross-α structure [67]. Of the fibril EM images shown in Fig. 2, four publications determined that p3 is ThT positive, one of which demonstrated a very low fluorescence intensity, and one additional publication determined that p3 is ThT negative [28,42,43,46,68]. Congo red is a dye that exhibits birefringence under polarized light upon binding amyloid fibrils. Lalowski et. al. stated that the p3 structures exhibited “characteristic apple-green birefringence” in some foci [28], however the images were published in black and white, so it is difficult to verify these findings, and Milton et. al. demonstrated Congo red binding but did not mention birefringence [45].

Kinetics of p3 Fibril Formation

Efforts to understand the kinetics of fibril formation for p3 have revealed that p3 aggregates more rapidly than Aβ via ThT and sedimentation assays [41,46]. In addition, p3 exhibited substantially more sedimentation of aggregates when compared with Aβ (80% for p3 as compared to 40% for Aβ) [41]. This is in stark contrast with the claims that p3 is soluble and preferentially exists as a monomer [34,69].

Intermediate Oligomer Formation

While not mentioned directly in the definition of an amyloid as defined by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Society of Amyloidosis, oligomers are widely considered to be the more relevant toxic species in Alzheimer’s Disease rather than fibrils [3–6]. There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not p3 forms transient oligomers during the transition from monomer to fiber. Vandersteen et. al. found that p3 binds A11 [46], the oligomer-specific antibody [70]. However, two other groups were unable to trap intermediate oligomers using oligomer forming conditions typically applied for Aβ [43,71]. The mechanism by which p3 aggregates remains unclear aside from theoretical calculations employing Molecular Dynamics [63,71–75]. For example, Cheon et. al. determined that p3 forms U-shaped protofilaments from disordered oligomers via a series of PRIME20/DMD simulations [75].

Furthermore, as mentioned by Chiti and Dobson, toxic, intermediate oligomers of Aβ have large hydrophobic regions exposed on the external surface [76]. The micelle-like, external hydrophobicity of oligomers is thought to be driven by an interaction with lipid-rich regions of cell membranes [77,78]. Jang et. al. [63] found that p3 (17–42) forms annular, channel-like structures that protrude from the membrane of lipid bilayers, similar to the membrane-associated oligomers formed by Aβ40/42 [77,78]. Given the extensive hydrophobic content of p3, it seems plausible that a similar confirmation could be achieved for p3. Further work is needed to understand what intermediates are formed during the aggregation of p3.

POTENTIAL SYNERGY BETWEEN Aβ AND P3

Another question yet to be answered is whether or not p3 and Aβ can interact with each other. The propensity of Aβ to interact with other molecules through hydrophobic contacts has been well established and includes other proteins, such as the prion protein [79], the islet amyloid polypeptide [80], α-synuclein [81,82], as well as other non-polar species, such as cholesterol [83], or even carbon nanotubes [84]. This suggests that Aβ is a promiscuous peptide capable to interacting and possibly aggregating with other molecules, thus forming heterogenous species. This should not come as a surprise given the heterogenous nature of amyloid plaques [20–23]. In fact, substantial studies have shown that the pyroglutamate modifications of Aβ truncations, Aβ (pE3–40/42) and Aβ (pE11–40/42), can both seed and interact with Aβ [85–89]. Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted investigating the co-aggregation and or seeding effects between p3 and Aβ.

Moreover, a lysine to asparagine heterozygous, missense mutation of AβPP (K16N), located at the α-secretase cleavage site, reduces the production of the p3 peptide by 40–50% [90]. People with this mutation are more likely to experience early onset dementia, which is attributed to the production of cytotoxic, heterogenous, proteolysis resistant aggregates and enhanced production of Aβ from AβPP. However, the AβK16N mutant will also have distinct biophysical and biological properties from Aβ, so that no direct comparison can be made. This mutation may indicate that the ratio of p3:Aβ is an important factor to consider when attempting to understand the role of p3 in AD.

BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF P3 COMPARED WITH Aβ

Despite the non-amyloidogenic designation that p3 has received, several publications have reported that it exhibits toxicity [41,63,91,92] and elicits a biological response [63,92,93]. Similar to much of the work surrounding p3, there are varied findings on the toxicity of p3 when compared with Aβ [91,92]. Pike et. al. [41] found that fibrillar p3 (17–40/42) was substantially more toxic than Aβ (40/42) in cultured hippocampal neurons. The same was true for freshly prepared p3 (17–40) vs. Aβ (1–40). Wei et. al. [92] supported these findings that p3 (17–40) is more toxic than Aβ (1–40) in SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells. In contrast, Liu et. al. [91] found that fibrillar p3 (17–40) and Aβ (1–40) are equally toxic to SH-SY5Y cells. However, interestingly, Pike et. al. [41] also found that freshly prepared p3 (17–42) was substantially less toxic than Aβ (1–42) in hippocampal neurons. While it is clear that both p3 (17–40) and p3 (17–42) exhibit toxicity in a variety of tissue culture cell lines, it is unclear how this toxicity compares with Aβ given the discrepancies described above. Walsh and coworkers found that synthetic p3 at a concentration of 11.5 nM did not block hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) [4]. However, it is not clear why this concentration was chosen, especially because significantly higher concentrations are typically used for experiments of this nature [94,95].

Calcium dysregulation is thought to play a role in the cell toxicity of Aβ [96]. Jang and coworkers found that p3 forms ion channels and disrupts calcium regulation, inducing death in human cortical neurons [63]. Also, Szczepanik and coworkers found that similar to Aβ, p3 is a pro-inflammatory glial modulator by initiating production of cytokines interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), MCP-1 [93].

PRODUCTION OF P3 AND IDENTITY OF α-SECRETASE

The N-terminus of p3 is generated by an α-secretase cleavage of AβPP in the plasma membrane and trans golgi network [97]. This cleavage also produces an ectodomain, AβPPα, which has been described as neuroprotective [98–100]. This may be an underlying reason why p3 has also been considered neuroprotective.

α-secretase is thought to be ADAM 10, of the disintegrin and metalloprotease family, which is a type I transmembrane protein containing 750 residues [101,102]. ADAM 10 knock-out results in early embryonic lethality presumably due to loss of Notch signaling [102]. Thus, if p3 were implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease, complete inhibition of α-secretase would not be a plausible treatment.

There is evidence indicating competition between α- and β- secretase activity, possibly attributed to the difference in cellular locations of AβPP processing[103]. This could potentially contribute to the vast number of failed β-secretase inhibitors if α-secretase activity is enhanced upon inhibition of β-secretase. Further studies should be done to quantify the levels of all products of AβPP in the blood and CSF during clinical trials to identify if alternative processing pathways are altered upon inactivation of β-secretase.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

In summary, there is some evidence that the “non-amyloidogenic” designation of p3 should be revisited, as it seems to share some of the amyloid-like properties of Aβ. The published cytotoxicity and aggregation studies, while incredibly conflicting, elude to the possibility of this peptide playing a larger role than previously described in the aggregation of amyloids in AD brains. Further effort should be aimed at understanding the complex biological and biophysical properties of p3, both with respect to its role alone and its effect on full-length Aβ. Once a clear relationship between Aβ and the other relevant AβPP processing products is established, a multifaceted therapeutic approach can be achieved.
