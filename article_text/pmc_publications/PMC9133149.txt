More than 50 million people worldwide live with a dementia, and most are cared for by family members. Family caregivers often experience chronic stress and insomnia, resulting in decreased mental and physical health. Accessibility of in-person stress reduction therapy is limited due to caregiver time constraints and distance from therapy sites. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) provides mindfulness and guided imagery tools to reduce stress, promote self and other understanding, and increase feelings of interconnectedness. Combining MIT with caregiver skills training might enable caregivers to both reduce stress and better utilize newly learned caregiving skills, but this has never been studied. Delivering MIT through a smartphone application (App) has the potential to overcome difficulties with scalability and dissemination and offers caregivers an easy-to-use format. Harnessing passive smartphone data provides an important opportunity to study behavioral changes continuously and with higher granularity than routine clinical assessments. This protocol describes a randomized, controlled, superiority trial in which 120 family dementia caregivers, aged 60 years or older, will be assigned to smartphone App delivery of caregiver skills with MIT (experimental condition) or without MIT (control condition). The primary objectives of the trial are (1) to assess whether the experimental condition is superior to control on reducing family caregiver stress, insomnia and related outcomes and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of developing behavioral markers from passive smartphone data that predict health outcomes in older adults. Trial outcomes may inform the suitability of our intervention for caregivers and provide new methods for assessment of older adults.


pmc1. Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, more than 50 million people have Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related disorders (AD/ADRD), with most individuals receiving care from their family members(1). The stress and burden of caregiving negatively affects caregivers’ mental health, with a high proportion reporting elevated levels of depression(2–7), insomnia(8–11), stress(3,7,12), poorer cognitive outcomes(2,7), and anxiety(3,12). To promote caregiver wellbeing, previous research has focused on providing skills for behavioral management of the person living with dementia, support and psychoeducational groups to help caregivers learn from each others’ experiences, group cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness techniques, or combinations of these(12–17). A common limitation of most trials of individual and/or group therapies for family caregivers is that delivery of the intervention occurs in person. In-person delivery may impose additional burden on caregivers related to travel and arrangement of substitute caregiving, and is less acceptable for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic(18). Furthermore, in-person delivery necessitates clinician resources in terms of meeting space and on-site personnel. In-person individual or group interventions thus have a common drawback of scalability for widespread feasibility and dissemination.

The purpose of this manuscript is to describe a protocol for a randomized, controlled trial that will test a smartphone App delivering Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT) as an augmentation to caregiver skills training. MIT is a “second generation” mindfulness therapy(19,20), which couples mindful practice to reduce emotional arousal with psychological principles designed to balance mentalizing. Mindfulness refers to non-judgmental, present-focused attention(21) and has been found to reduce depressive and anxious symptoms in community and clinical populations(22,23). In MIT, mindfulness is strengthened by gentle stretching and meditative exercises (24). Mentalizing refers to understanding the mental processes of self and others, and their links to observable behaviors within complex interpersonal situations(25). In MIT, guided imagery exercises consist of participants imagining their own and others’ perspectives and reactions, and the connectedness between self and other (19). Pilot studies have utilized 4-week group MIT for family AD/ADRD caregivers. Results have shown promising improvements in psychological symptoms such as caregiver depression and anxiety(24,26), and increasing perceived mental well-being and relationship quality(27). Smartphone delivery of MIT has been shown to be acceptable for family dementia caregivers in a feasibility trial(28). By providing caregiver skills, mindfulness training, and mentalizing exercises, the experimental intervention could result in synergism that enables the caregiver to better assist the person with dementia in their unique interpersonal context.

Smartphone delivery of therapeutic techniques holds tremendous promise for several reasons. First, it increases potential for portability. Second, it enables caregivers to access information and support when they need it and initiate usage any time, thus optimizing their control of the process. It also provides a scalable approach to deliver notification reminders for caregivers to complete home exercises. Finally, it provides non-invasive, passive monitoring capabilities, potentially reducing burden associated with participating in nonpharmacological trials. Precisely and objectively monitoring participant behavior through passive smartphone sensors affords the opportunity to identify “digital phenotypes”(29) that are associated with psychological symptoms. Digital phenotypes quantify moment-by-moment information about behaviors using data from smartphones and other digital (most often wearable) devices(30). Such phenotypes may enable adaptive interventions(31,32) provide early signs of poor treatment response (33), or presage symptomatic worsening(34,35). Few studies have focused on identifying digital phenotypes specifically in an older adult caregiver population to measure treatment outcomes or monitor daily symptoms(36).

The goals of the current protocol are to address gaps in the literature regarding smartphone delivery of MIT to older adult caregivers and the feasibility of development of digital phenotypes that link to clinical outcomes. The first aim of the trial is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with MIT (experimental condition) or without MIT (control condition) on caregivers’ perceived stress, which is the primary outcome. The second aim is of the trial is to develop digital phenotypes of participant behaviors associated with psychological outcomes such as perceived stress and insomnia.

2. METHODS/DESIGN

Study Design

To achieve the aims of this study, a randomized, controlled trial will be conducted with 120 family AD/ADRD caregivers. The arms include Mentalizing Imagery Therapy + Caregiver skills (MIT+CS-App), or the control condition, caregiver skills (CS-App) (Figure 1). Both arms are supported by optional virtual group telehealth sessions. An active comparator consisting of psychoeducation and support was chosen to control for (1) amount of therapist contact time and (2) acquisition of skills, and to determine whether smartphone-based skills training is associated with psychosocial benefits. Stratified randomization will be deployed with caregiver sex and dementia patient severity (Dementia Severity Rating Scale (37)) as two key strata. Within each stratum, group assignment will be determined by block randomization in groups of twelve sequential participants (http://www.random.org).

Of the 120 participants, 60 will receive the MIT+CS-App, while the other half will receive the CS-App. The study will consist of two phases over 24 weeks. In the first phase of active treatment (8 weeks), participants will undergo baseline assessments and receive mobile App treatment supported by optional weekly virtual groups, followed by assessment of the primary outcome (perceived stress) and secondary outcomes. This will be followed by a continuation phase (16 weeks) during which caregivers will be allowed to continue using the assigned App unsupervised, followed by repeat outcomes assessment. All participants will be 60 years of age or older to ensure a focus on usability by those underserved by technological innovations and at highest risk of intrinsic decline(38). Participants will be blinded to study hypotheses. Because outcome measures are self-reported, blinding of clinical outcome raters is not applicable. The trial has been registered at clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT05253443. For further regulatory details including dissemination and data sharing, please refer to online supplementary material (OSM).

Hypotheses

Clinical outcomes.

We hypothesize that at the week 8 timepoint, caregivers receiving MIT+CS-App will exhibit superiority on psychological outcome measures relative to those receiving CS-App alone. Perceived stress will be the primary outcome, and secondarily we will assess caregiver burden, mastery, insomnia and depression. Furthermore, we predict that overall App usage (total number of App CS or MIT skill sessions) will mediate improvements in PSS. We also hypothesize that the beneficial effects of MIT+CS-App versus CS-App will remain significant at the 24-week follow-up.

Digital phenotyping hypotheses.

We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features that predict day-to-day stress.

Mobile applications

The treatment mobile Apps (Table 1) will be available for download in the Apple App store for iOS devices or on Google Play for Android and will require an anonymized activation code for use. After written informed consent is obtained remotely using REDCap by a member of the study staff, participants will be instructed by videoconference to download and activate two Apps: 1. the treatment App assigned to them and 2. the open-source Beiwe application(30) for digital phenotyping.

Both mobile Apps contain caregiver skills information. In addition to caregiver skills, the MIT+CS-App will deliver MIT techniques and practices to caregivers. Both Apps will gather ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) on a daily basis via a push notification. The Beiwe App will be used to passively monitor smartphone sensor data (please refer to OSM for full details). All caregivers will receive download and other technical support as needed.

Caregiver Skills mobile application components.

Information and links to quality video resources on caregiver skills topics for supporting the person with dementia such as: understanding environmental, social, and cognitive causes of difficult behaviors; repetitive behaviors; refusals; sundowning; wandering; aggression; stages of dementia; and ideas for daily activities.

Mentalizing Imagery Therapy mobile application components.

Written information, videos and audio recordings on the following topics: mindful stretching and breathing, meditation, chair yoga and guided imagery. Guided imagery practices are 20–30 minutes long and consist of a focused, imaginative, meditative process led by an instructor in real-time or by audio recording, during which the participant is generally seated with eyes closed. The focus of guided imagery is balancing mentalization of self and others at rest and in challenging situations. These practices also explicitly target connectedness to communities, mentalization of social groups, and interconnectedness with nature as previously described(19,28).

Optional Virtual Groups

Optional real-time virtual groups conducted using HIPAA-compliant telehealth technology. These will be staffed by a therapist with at least a bachelor’s degree and two years of experience training caregivers. During videoconferences, caregivers will receive psychosocial support which includes empathic listening to caregiver concerns, encouragement to comprehensively elaborate the source of caregiver difficulties, identification of common concerns among caregivers, and brainstorming to find possible solutions. There will also be question-and-answer sessions and didactic content related to MIT and/or CS based on a treatment manual. The treatment manual for each group has been adapted from manuals previously developed for our in-person trials (24,26) but modified to facilitate accompaniment with the App. In both groups, use of the mobile App will be reviewed and questions regarding App content and navigation will be answered. For additional technical support details, please refer to OSM.

Participants

Participants will be recruited using a multipronged approach which will include placing flyers in outpatient clinics serving dementia patients in the local Boston area, Facebook advertisements and other web postings. Targeted mailings will be sent through the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and to health maintenance organizations serving an older adult population nationally. The primary strategy to recruit underrepresented groups will focus on community engagement. The PI and co-investigators will attend community informational fairs to hand out flyers, give talks for community groups, and encourage participation in focus groups by underrepresented minorities to determine their preferences. To achieve a representative racial and ethnic sample similar to that of the United States 2020 Census, we will also target direct mail to caregivers of people living with dementia who live in zip codes known to have a high proportion of minority individuals. Flyers and other materials have been tailored for diverse populations. We will also make use of our institutional resources for minority recruitment, such as the MGH CARE (Community Access, Recruitment and Engagement) Center.

Participants will be screened via videoconference for psychiatric disorders utilizing the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview(39) and for cognitive impairment with the Mini Mental Status Examination (40). All procedures involving human participants will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Inclusion Criteria

Study participants must meet the following criteria: (1) self-identify as the primary family caregiver (or “care partner”) for a relative with a clinical or research diagnosis of dementia, (2) 60 years of age or older, (3) answer “yes” to whether they carry and use a smartphone on a regular basis (at least 5 days per week), and (4) self-report English language fluency. Primary caregiver (or care partner) is defined as the person most responsible for ensuring the well-being of the person with dementia, whether providing direct care, managing the care provided by others, or monitoring their well-being at a nursing facility or other facility. For concurrent treatments, participants may be receiving treatment for mental health disorders at entry (medication or psychotherapy). However, they cannot enroll earlier than 6 weeks after the last change in medication dose or psychotherapy visit frequency. They will be allowed to continue with their current regimen without change while in the active phase (first 8 weeks) of the study. Following completion of the active phase they may change their medication or psychotherapy regimen.

Exclusion Criteria

Exclusion criteria include: (1) active psychosis or mania, (2) suicide attempt in the past 6 months or current active suicidal ideation, (3) cognitive impairment (MMSE &lt; 26), (4) unstable medical illness or planned major surgery, (5) substance use disorder in the past six months, and (6) mindfulness or guided imagery practice more than once per week in the past three months.

Measures

A full list of data to be obtained from participants may be found in Table 2.

Psychological Outcome Scales

The following pre-specified primary and secondary outcome scales will be collected at baseline, eight weeks, and 24-weeks, using REDCap(41) electronic data capture tools and questionnaires on the mobile App. All measures will be accessible for completion remotely on the caregivers’ smartphone.

Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

The PSS(42) is a 14-item self-report questionnaire that measures the magnitude to which various situations in an individual’s life are appraised as stressful. The PSS has been extensively used and has established psychometric properties including reliability and validity (43). Each item is anchored by a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = never to 4 = very often. An example item is, “In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?” The range of possible scores is 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating worse perceived stress.

Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale (CBS).

The CBS(44) is a 22-item self-report assessment that measures the burden a caregiver feels. The CBS is a widely used measure with established reliability and validity(45). Each item is anchored on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 = never to 4 = nearly always. An example item is, “Do you feel that because of the time you spend with your relative that you don’t have enough time for yourself?” The range of possible scores is 0 to 88, with higher scores indicating more caregiver burden.

Caregiver Mastery Index (CMI).

The CMI(46) is a 6-item self-report scale, in which a caregiver measures their level of perceived mastery when providing care. Reliability and validity have not been fully established for this measure(46). Cronbach alpha in a study of 509 patients was reported as 0.58(47). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 = never to 4 = nearly always. Scores are calculated by reversing the three negatively scored items and summing to generate a total score, with higher scores indicating greater mastery. An example item is, “In general, I feel able to handle most problems in the care of my impaired relative.” The range of possible scores is 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater caregiver mastery.

Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

The ISI(48) is a 7-item self-report measure that yields the degree to which one is suffering from insomnia, and has excellent reliability and validity(49). Each item is anchored on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater symptoms. An example item is, “How satisfied/dissatisfied are you with your current sleep pattern?” The range of possible scores is 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating worse insomnia. Participants scoring at least 8 on this measure at baseline (indicating at least subthreshold insomnia) will be selected for secondary outcome analysis.

Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Report (QIDS-SR).

The QIDS-SR(50) is comprised of 16-items, and analyzes the severity of depressive symptoms. The QIDS-SR has been widely used in pharmaceutical and behavioral trials of depression and has excellent reliability and validity(51). Each item is anchored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. The total composite score assesses the maximum score for each of the nine cardinal symptoms of major depressive disorder, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptom severity (range of possible scores, 0 to 27). Participants scoring at least 6 at baseline (mild depressive symptoms or greater) will be selected for secondary analysis.

Ecological momentary assessments, passive smartphone data collection and mobile application usage data:

please refer to OSM.

Statistical Analysis Plans

Clinical measures will be examined for baseline group differences utilizing t-tests for continuous and likelihood-ratio chi-square for categorical variables. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) will be used to estimate the effect of Time and Time by Group interactions on primary and secondary outcome measures from baseline to 8 weeks (primary outcome), as well as from baseline to 24-weeks. If there are baseline differences on demographic or caregiving variables, the models will be run with and without these as covariates. Post hoc comparisons will be made within group if there are significant omnibus effects. In order to examine whether App usage mediates improvements in caregivers’ perceived stress, a mediation analysis with bootstrapping(52) will be performed with group as the predictor, total number of App-performed MIT and CS didactic sessions as the mediator, and PSS change as the outcome. Covariates listed above will also be used as moderators in exploratory analyses to inform the design of larger trials.

Power Calculations

Assuming there are 20 dropouts per group (67% retention), the sample size will yield 40 analyzable participants per group and provide 80% power to detect effect size of f = .27 (a small effect) with alpha = .05. Based on our pilot data, this would be adequate to assess the clinical effects of MIT+CS-App versus the CS-App from baseline to 8-weeks and 24-weeks. For correlation of smartphone estimated sleep with ISI, a sample of 80 completers will provide 80% power to detect a difference with alpha of .05 and an effect of r=.60. This is supported by previous research, which has indicated that self-reported sleep duration was moderately correlated with smartphones’ passively estimated sleep (r=0.69, 95% CI 0.23–0.90) in 17 individuals with schizophrenia60. For details of statistical analysis of smartphone data, please refer to OSM.

3. DISCUSSION

Providing a mobile App that delivers caregiver skills and mentalizing techniques to an older population of AD/ADRD caregivers is a novel strategy to alleviate the stress and burden they face and may increase scalability. The focus on adults over age 60 targets those underserved by studies of mobile technology innovations. Results of the proposed study will inform on the feasibility of delivery approach and efficacy of the interventions for caregiver stress and insomnia. This study builds on the groundwork of our prior research demonstrating that App delivery of MIT was feasible for older adult caregivers(28) and extends it to address additional questions of import in the psychological and technical domains.

The choice of perceived stress as the primary outcome addresses a near universal experience of family AD/ADRD caregivers(53). Family AD/ADRD caregivers are faced with needing to shoulder increased responsibility and manage a range of issues with which they often have had no prior personal experience. Simultaneously, they must also confront an illness that robs their relative of memory and normal behavior, and that may threaten financial ruin. Furthermore, the caregivers often experience reduced ability to take part in their own health promoting and social activities outside the home(54). Whether remote MIT and skills intervention can play a key role in reducing caregiver stress is as yet unclear. Although a randomized controlled trial for family dementia caregivers of in-person MIT (without caregiver skills) versus a psychosocial support group resulted in superior reductions in perceived stress in the MIT arm with a large effect size(55), resultant stress levels were overall still in the moderate range according to historical norms. The current experimental intervention coupling MIT with caregiver skills might reduce caregiver stress further by eliminating travel needs and providing more comprehensive caregiver training. However, the possibility remains that caregivers will experience a reduction in stress-ameliorating psychosocial support and connection due to the lack of in-person meetings.

Most studies for caregivers of mindfulness techniques or other forms of emotion regulation skills have occurred in isolation from caregiver skills training. The particular novelty of the MIT approach is that in addition to providing emotion regulation skills, it also seeks to stimulate self and other understanding. It does so through an imaginal process of simulating the reciprocal influences of self on other, and other on self, in the context of challenging situations(19). Studying caregiver mastery as an outcome will provide pilot data to inform on whether the incorporation of these emotion regulation and mentalizing skills indeed enables for a greater perceived sense of effectiveness in the caregiver role. However, if improvements in mastery are similar between groups, it might suggest that (1) caregiver skills training is sufficient, (2) that the links between mentalizing and mastery of the caregiver skills are indirect, or even (3) that the particular MIT techniques utilized are not as helpful for improving caregiver mentalizing as our prior work has suggested(27). In this eventuality, semi-structured exit interviews will help differentiate among these possibilities.

Data from this trial will also identify the feasibility of using passive smartphone data to objectively identify treatment outcomes and to monitor symptoms daily. If successful, this could have important implications for delivery of measurement-based care to caregivers. Within the mental health field, there is an increasing appreciation for the role of using structured questionnaires to monitor treatment progress and track progression. Use of these instruments, however, is hampered by issues such as time constraints, patient privacy, and organizational and systems level barriers. Incorporation of structured questionnaires into most clinics has not been achieved(56). Self-report questionnaires also suffer from recency bias and other forms of systematic bias(57). Passive data does not have these limitations and thus could be more readily scalable. Successfully tracking chronic stress and insomnia passively might help to intervene early and more dynamically adjust interventions to prevent caregivers from developing psychological and physical comorbidities.

Potential limitations and plans for mitigation

The most important limitation concerns the inclusion criteria, which specifies that only older adult caregivers regularly using a smartphone are eligible. This limits the population to those older adults already familiar with smartphone technology, which is estimated to be about half of older adults, though adoption is increasing(58,59). While limitation of the current trial to the population of regular users was believed to be necessary for feasibility, future research will seek to generalize results to the population of older adults who do not already use smartphones. This might follow a strategy of offering older adults training in the basics of smartphone usage and providing a dedicated device to those who do not own them.

Racial and ethnic minority individuals are historically underrepresented in research of technological innovations and dementia care. Notably, though, smartphones are more widely adopted than computers or tablets by minority individuals(60). Thus, implementation of an intervention accessible via mobile phone might result in increased access for minorities, as was demonstrated by a virtual pilot trial of MIT for Spanish language AD/ADRD caregivers(61). Spanish language caregivers have not been included in the current trial due to a need for cultural adaptation of the caregiver skills components of the intervention. Future research will include mixed methods studies to better identify preferences for mobile App content among Spanish language caregivers.

An additional limitation is that the trial is not designed to determine mechanism of action. Although we will assess mediators such as overall App usage, we expect that those in the MIT arm will use the Apps more frequently and for longer periods of time. Thus, a definitive assessment cannot be made of whether expected improvements are due to non-specific effects of engagement or MIT active components. If App usage is found to be a mediator, further research with controls matched for homework exercises and App engagement will be required to definitively assess active mechanisms.

Finally, it it is unknown for how many hours per day on average older adults carry a cell phone (and thus the potential for passive data collection in this population). This trial will provide valuable information regarding cell phone use in a caregiver sample that endorses using a smartphone at least 5 days a week.

4. CONCLUSIONS

This protocol describes a clinical trial design with novel features including delivery to older adults by smartphone App and support with optional virtual group sessions (that are also smartphone accessible). This will be the first study to test whether the provision of mentalizing training provides synergistic benefits with caregiver skills training. The incorporation of digital phenotyping may help to address limitations related to timing, recency bias and investigator bias inherent in psychological questionnaires and clinician ratings. The results promise to inform our understanding of mobile and accessible technologies for an older adult sample of caregivers. If successful, this trial may open new avenues of intervention for older adult caregivers and also may inform new measurement strategies to remotely and efficiently track psychological symptoms in an older adult population.
