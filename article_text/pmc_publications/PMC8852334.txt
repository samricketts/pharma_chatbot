Objective:

Worse hearing was linked to higher brain β-amyloid, a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, in a recent study. We analyze the associations between β-amyloid and early age-related hearing loss in the right versus left ear to explore the laterality of this relationship.

Study Design:

Cross-sectional analysis of a prospective cohort study

Setting:

Tertiary referral center

Participants:

98 late middle-age adults

Interventions:

None

Main Outcome Measures:

The primary outcome was whole brain and regional β-amyloid standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) on positron emission tomography. The exposure was hearing in the right and left ear, measured by pure tone average (PTA) and word recognition score (WRS). Linear regression analyzed the association between β-amyloid and hearing in each ear, adjusting for potential confounders, including age, gender, education, cardiovascular disease, and hearing aid use.

Results:

Mean age±standard deviation was 64.3±3.5 years. Mean PTA was 20.4±8.8 dB. Multivariable regression adjusting for covariates demonstrated that a 10 dB worsening in PTA in the left ear was associated with significantly higher β-amyloid (SUVR) in the bilateral cingulate gyri (right coefficient: 0.029, [95% confidence interval: 0.003–0.054]; left: 0.029 [0.003–0.055]), bilateral frontal lobes (right: 0.024 [0.002–0.047]; left: 0.028, [0.006–0.049]), and the right temporal lobe (0.019 [0.002–0.037]). Consistent results were observed when WRS served as the exposure. No associations were observed between β-amyloid and PTA or WRS in the right ear.

Conclusions:

Worse hearing in the left ear, but not the right ear, was associated with higher β-amyloid. This might relate to asymmetric central auditory processing.


pmcIntroduction

Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a gradual degeneration of the auditory system in older adults. It involves both ears and first affects perception of high frequency sounds, successively followed by lower frequencies. ARHL is highly prevalent, affecting nearly 50% of adults ages 60–69 and over 80% of those over 85 years old.1–6 Moreover, ARHL has been linked to conditions of aging including dementia7–9 and depression.9–12 In fact, recent evidence suggests that if ARHL were eliminated as a risk factor, the incidence of dementia may decrease by 8%. This is a higher percentage than any other individual modifiable risk factor for dementia, including smoking, depression, hypertension, social isolation, and low early-life education.13

Several mechanisms underlying the association between ARHL and dementia have been proposed. Causal hypotheses center around ARHL-induced structural brain changes, shifting of cognitive resources from memory to hearing, and social isolation. Non-causal hypotheses highlight common underlying pathologies leading to both ARHL and dementia.14 The focus of this study is how β-amyloid, a neuropathologic biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease, may be linked to ARHL. While conflicting, some early evidence suggests that more severe hearing loss is linked to higher β-amyloid across many brain regions.15 The mechanistic nature of this relationship remains unclear.

The degree of hearing in the right versus left ear may not initially seem to play a role in the ARHL-cognition relationship due to the symmetric nature of ARHL. However, ARHL is often not perfectly symmetrical;6,16 these subtle asymmetries provide the substrate for further study. Furthermore, the brain does not symmetrically process auditory input. Specifically, each ear has stronger central connections to the opposite brain hemisphere,17 suggesting that hearing loss in each ear may be related to different downstream neural changes. Previous studies have shed light on how ARHL is associated with lateralized changes in the cerebral hemispheres.18,19 For example, Armstrong et al identified that hearing loss in the right ear, compared to the left ear, was associated with steeper volumetric declines in various regions of both temporal lobes. To our knowledge, only one previous study has examined the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and the laterality of hearing loss. This study identified that central auditory function in the left ear, as measured by the dichotic sentence identification test, was a significant predictor of overall brain connectivity on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in participants with Alzheimer’s disease.20 Interestingly, central auditory function of the right ear was not significantly correlated. The distinct results between the right and left ear merit further investigation with additional cognition-related outcome measures, such as β-amyloid.

Our objective was to conduct a post-hoc analysis of a prior study15 by analyzing the associations between brain β-amyloid and early ARHL in the right versus left ear. Examining the neuropathological associations of hearing loss in each ear may inform how asymmetric central auditory pathways may be differentially related to Alzheimer’s pathology. Given the limited prior literature examining the laterality of hearing loss (or any risk factors that possess laterality) and β-amyloid, this was an exploratory analysis without an a priori hypothesis of which ear(s) may be associated with β-amyloid.

Methods

Study Cohort

Participants were included from the Northern Manhattan Study of Metabolism and Mind (NOMEM), an ongoing community-based prospective, observational cohort study based at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. NOMEM includes community residents of northern Manhattan and the Bronx who are late middle-age. Participants were healthy community volunteers without dementia by self-report. All testing was conducted in English or Spanish per participant preference.

NOMEM participants who underwent audiometry were included in the hearing subcohort of NOMEM (NOMEM-Hearing). Participants were excluded from NOMEM-Hearing if they had open wounds on or near the auricle. Of 460 enrolled participants in NOMEM, 98 participants underwent both audiometry and PET neuroimaging and met inclusion criteria. While NOMEM-Hearing is an ongoing longitudinal study, only one wave of data is available, making the analysis cross-sectional. The Institutional Review Board at Columbia University Irving Medical Center approved this study (#AAAQ2950, AAAI5156, AAAR5012).

Hearing Assessment

Participants first completed a questionnaire that inquired about history of ear disease and ear surgery, past and current issues with hearing, and whether they wore a hearing device. If the participant reported wearing a device, they were asked to identify the type of device (hearing aid, cochlear implant, or other) and estimate frequency of wear (hours/week).

Participants underwent audiometry from 2017–2019. Testing was conducted in a quiet room with ambient noise continuously measured as &lt;45 dB A. A clinically validated21 iPad-based audiometer (ShoeBox; Clearwater Clinical, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) that complies with guidelines established by the American National Standards Institute22 was used. Sound-attenuating headphones (DD450, RadioEar, Eden Prairie, Minnesota; which have attenuation of 46 dB at 4000 Hz)23 were calibrated to the audiometer and placed on the participant after removing any external hearing devices. Air-conduction pure tone thresholds (in dB hearing level) were measured. The pure tone average (PTA) for each ear was calculated by averaging thresholds at 0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz.

Word recognition score (WRS) was the percentage of 25 correctly repeated English or Spanish words presented at suprathreshold loudness (+35 dB for PTA &lt;50 dB, +30 dB for PTA 50–59 dB, +20 dB for PTA 60–69 dB, +10 dB for PTA ≥70 dB) without any background noise. Word recognition testing does not test memory, and is not affected by memory loss, as the participant is asked to instantly repeat the word after presentation.

PTA in the right and left ears served as the primary exposure. The secondary exposure was WRS in the right and left ears. Hearing was analyzed as a continuous variable to maximize power.

β-amyloid

Participants were injected with the radiotracer 18F-florbetaben to identify β amyloid signal. Participants underwent positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans 90 minutes postinjection (Siemens Biograph 64, Siemens, Munich, Germany). Static PET images were registered with CT scans.

The intensity of the β-amyloid signal is expressed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR).24 A higher SUVR in a brain region indicates greater β-amyloid pathology. The standardized uptake value was the decay-corrected concentration of radioactivity normalized for injected dose and body weight. The standardized uptake value at each voxel was normalized to that of cerebellar gray matter to calculate the SUVR. Mean SUVR was calculated for the whole brain as well as various regions of interest, including frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and parietal cortex.25

Statistical Analysis

The association between right ear PTA and continuous β-amyloid SUVR as well as left ear PTA and continuous β-amyloid SUVR was analyzed using univariable and multivariable linear regression. Covariates included age (years), gender (woman/man), education (years), cardiovascular disease (composite score), and hearing device use (yes/no). The cardiovascular composite score ranged from 0 to 4, with 1 point being added for each of the following: hypertension (blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg), diabetes (self-reported), stroke (self-reported), and heart attack (self-reported). If data for one of the four cardiovascular variables were missing (n=2), the score for the missing variable was imputed using the mean of scores for the other three variables. This composite score was used, rather than individual cardiovascular risk factors, to avoid multicollinearity.26

PTA was analyzed according to a 10 dB unit of change, which approximates a half-category change in hearing level (where hearing categories are defined as normal, mild, moderate, moderately-severe, and profound). Higher PTA indicated worse hearing. WRS was analyzed according to a 10-percentage point unit of change. Lower WRS indicated worse hearing. β-amyloid SUVR was analyzed continuously, with higher values indicating increased β-amyloid burden. Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05. Adjustment for multiple comparisons was not performed as this was a strictly exploratory analysis. Data analysis was performed using the R programming language v3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with RStudio v1.2.5033 (RStudio, Boston, MA).

Results

Study Participants and Characteristics

Table 1 highlights baseline characteristics of the cohort (n=98). Mean age (±SD) was 64.3 years (±3.5) and ranged from 51–72 years. The cohort included 65% women. Of the 98 participants, 23 (23%) had hearing loss (defined as &gt;25 dB PTA in the better ear) and 2% used hearing aids. No participants had cochlear implants or other hearing devices.

Mean PTA in the right ear was 24.0 dB (± 10.5, range: 5.0–53.75 dB) and mean PTA in the left ear was 22.9 dB (± 11.6, range: 5.0–71.3 dB). Mean WRS in the right ear was 95.6% (± 12.0, range: 0–100%) and mean WRS in the left ear was 95.2% (± 12.5, range: 12–100%). There was no significant difference between PTA or WRS in the right versus left ear (PTA p=0.270, WRS p=0.784 by paired samples T-test). Mean global amyloid level was 1.16 (± 0.11). The relationship between hearing in the right and left ear versus age is depicted in Figure 1.

Regression Models Using Hearing Defined by Pure Tone Average

Linear regression assumptions were assessed and met. There were no significant relationships between PTA in the right or left ear and global amyloid SUVR in the univariable (right ear p=0.265, left ear p=0.115) and multivariable analyses (right ear p=0.235; left ear p=0.076) (Table 2).

The relationship between PTA of the right and left ear was also analyzed according to specific brain regions of interest. Multivariable regression adjusting for covariates, including age, gender, education, cardiovascular composite score, and hearing device use, demonstrated that a 10 dB worsening in PTA in the left ear was associated with significantly higher β-amyloid SUVR in the bilateral cingulate gyri (right coefficient [coef]: 0.029, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.003–0.054; left coef: 0.029, 95% CI: 0.003–0.055), bilateral frontal lobes (right coef: 0.024, 95% CI: 0.002–0.047; left coef: 0.028, 95% CI: 0.006–0.049), and right temporal lobe (coef: 0.019, 95% CI: 0.002–0.037) (Table 3). A representative PET scan of high SUVR in these regions is included in the Supplement. No significant relationships were identified between PTA in the right ear and β-amyloid SUVR in any brain regions of interest.

In a sensitivity analysis, education was removed as a covariate. There were no significant relationships between PTA in the right or left ear and global amyloid SUVR in the multivariable analyses (right ear p=0.317; left ear p=0.131). PTA in the left ear was associated with significantly higher β-amyloid SUVR in the left frontal lobe (coef: 0.025, 95% CI: 0.004–0.045). Again, no significant relationships were identified between PTA in the right ear and β-amyloid SUVR in any brain regions of interest.

Regression Models Using Hearing Defined by Word Recognition Score

There was a significant relationship between WRS in the left ear and global amyloid SUVR in univariable regression. For every 10% worsening (decrease) in WRS in the left ear, global amyloid SUVR was elevated by 0.021 (95% CI: 0.004, 0.038; p=0.017) (Table 4). Adding covariates to the model did not attenuate the effect size of this relationship (coef: 0.021; 95% CI: 0.001, 0.041; p=0.037) (Table 4). There were no significant relationships between WRS in the right ear and global amyloid SUVR in univariable or multivariable regression.

In multivariable analysis of brain regions of interest, 10% worsening in WRS in the left ear was associated with significantly higher β-amyloid SUVR in the bilateral cingulate gyri (right coef: 0.032, 95% CI: 0.010–0.054; left coef: 0.030, 95% CI: 0.008–0.053), bilateral parietal lobes (right coef: 0.026, 95% CI: 0.007–0.044; left coef: 0.018, 95% CI: 0.001–0.037), bilateral frontal lobes (right coef: 0.022, 95% CI: 0.002–0.042; left coef: 0.021, 95% CI: 0.002–0.041), and right temporal lobe (coef: 0.022, 95% CI: 0.007–0.037) (Table 5). No significant relationships were identified between WRS in the right ear and β-amyloid SUVR in any brain regions of interest.

In a sensitivity analysis, education was removed as a covariate. All of the aforementioned associations between WRS and β-amyloid SUVR were preserved.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that worse ARHL in the left ear was associated with higher brain β-amyloid burden in most measured regions of interest. These associations were present when controlling for potential confounders, including age, gender, education, cardiovascular disease, and hearing aid use. Worse hearing in the right ear, however, was not related to brain β-amyloid burden. Results were consistent whether hearing was measured by pure tone average or word recognition score. β-amyloid is a well-characterized biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. These results suggest that the mechanistic relationship between hearing loss and dementia may be influenced by lateralized differences in central auditory pathways.

To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the relationship between ear-specific hearing and brain β-amyloid. Our group previously found an association between ARHL overall (defined by hearing in the better ear) and brain β-amyloid.15 Overall, there is no consensus on whether there is a true relationship between ARHL and β-amyloid or other dementia biomarkers such as tau protein. Some animal studies have supported an association.27 However, clinical studies have generally shown mixed results28,29 or no relationship.30,31 The finding of an ear-specific relationship may expand upon hypotheses that support a mechanistic rather than by-chance association.

While β-amyloid is an established biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease, it is not clear what causes its formation. Certain factors, such as the APOE ɛ4 allele or vascular comorbidities, are thought to be causally related. There is no existing theory as to why ARHL would lead to β-amyloid formation. Cognitive symptoms of dementia and β-amyloid pathology are distinct entities. For example, some people with high β-amyloid burden have little cognitive impairment and some people with minimal β-amyloid burden have substantial cognitive impairment.32 Nonetheless, prior studies have identified a cutoff of SUVR &gt; 1.4 as “high” amyloid burden that is suggestive of Alzheimer’s disease.33–35 Furthermore, a previous study found that cognitively healthy individuals had a mean SUVR of 1.31 ± 0.4 SD.36 Thus, there is a relatively small difference (~0.09) between mean amyloid SUVR in non-demented individuals and those with Alzheimer’s disease. A regression coefficient of 0.03 change in SUVR for every 10 dB deterioration in hearing thresholds, for example, appears to represent a meaningful effect size, especially given that 10 dB is also a small change in hearing.

There are several theories of how ARHL may cause impaired cognition and dementia symptoms. One hypothesis is that diminished auditory input causes changes in brain macrostructure. Previous research identified associations between worse ARHL and lower gray matter volume in the primary auditory cortex,37–39 as well as worse hearing and accelerated atrophy of the whole brain.19 Among middle-aged adults, ARHL is associated with volumetric declines in several brain regions, including the right temporal gray matter, right hippocampus, and left entorhinal cortex.18 This, however, does not directly explain how ARHL might be associated with β-amyloid pathology. Another mechanistic hypothesis is that diminished auditory signals increase recruitment and activation of broad neural networks to compensate for disrupted auditory processing.40,41 Compensatory activation42,43 may function at the expense of other cognitive processes, such as memory.41 It is also possible that this higher neuronal activity might increase metabolic demand and production of free radicals, leading to higher β-amyloid deposition in later life.44 Finally, hearing loss can reduce social engagement, which may reduce cognitive stimulation and predispose to earlier cognitive decline.14 Lack of social engagement may therefore result in earlier expression of dementia symptoms, but is unlikely to be causally related to β-amyloid pathology.

The auditory signal arising from the ear is not processed symmetrically. After conversion from an acoustic to an electrical signal by the cochlea, the signal is carried by the cochlear nerve to the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei.17 The pathway then diverges into two. The direct, and dominant, path consists of axons from the dorsal cochlear nucleus traveling with the lateral lemniscus to the contralateral inferior colliculus.45 The indirect path consists of axons from the ventral cochlear nucleus traveling to both the ipsilateral and contralateral superior olivary nuclei, which then sends axons to the inferior colliculus.45 Signals are ultimately relayed to the auditory cortex within the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe. The auditory cortex integrates auditory information with sensory and motor inputs from other cortical areas and communicates with nearby structures, such as the hippocampus.46 (This connection between auditory processing and memory-forming structures of the brain may at least partially mediate the relationship between hearing loss and dementia.) In summary, the majority of nerve fibers from each ear cross to the contralateral side.47–49 This is clinically evident as well because unilateral pathology such as acoustic neuroma50 affects the contralateral auditory pathway more than the ipsilateral pathway.51,52

Although ARHL is typically bilateral and symmetric, the symmetry is imperfect, conveniently providing variation to study whether the right or left ear may have asymmetrical effects.6,16 The concepts of “right ear advantage” and hemispheric lateralization may support the findings of this study. The right ear advantage hypothesis53 is centered around the finding that participants have better recall of syllables presented to the right ear than the left ear when stimuli are presented to both ears simultaneously.54–58 In most individuals, the left hemisphere is dominant for auditory speech-language processing59 and the right ear, as noted previously, has stronger connections to the left hemisphere. Thus, the right ear may be advantaged for sound processing. In fact, those with mild Alzheimer’s disease tend to demonstrate an even larger right ear advantage than healthy controls.60–62 In the context of central effects of ARHL, this right ear advantage may provide some initial resilience to age-related decline in auditory input coming from the right side. In contrast, input from the left ear, with its weaker connection to the dominant language centers may be more vulnerable to age-related decline. Thus, one could speculate that left ear dysfunction may be more impactful in terms of downstream changes. However, one could also argue the converse scenario, where right ear dysfunction would be more impactful if it is relied upon more given its “advantage”. For example, in right-handed individuals, injury to the right hand would be more impactful than injury to the left hand. These theories are highly speculative and additional studies are warranted.

We found that worse left-ear PTA and WRS predicted elevated β-amyloid burden in both hemispheres and most regions of interest.63 However, one notable exception was in the temporal lobes, which house the auditory cortices. The right lateral temporal cortex demonstrated greater β-amyloid with worse left-ear PTA and WRS, while the left lateral temporal cortex did not. A previous study by our group using this cohort found that ARHL (defined by hearing in the better ear) was associated with β-amyloid in every analyzed region of interest in the brain except the left temporal lobe. Similarly, other studies have found an association between ARHL and lower volume in the right, but not left temporal lobe.19,37 Audiovisual cross-modal reorganization in hearing loss is also more likely to occur in the right rather than left temporal lobe.64,65 Because of the stronger connection between the left ear and the right temporal lobe, one could predict a stronger association between left sided hearing loss and right temporal lobe pathology, such as β-amyloid. Our findings therefore add to growing evidence that the paired left ear-right temporal lobe system is potentially more associated with pathologic change than the paired right ear-left temporal lobe system.

Recent studies have examined the laterality of ARHL and other downstream brain imaging findings. Notably, one recent study identified that central auditory processing of the left ear was significantly worse than that of the right ear, and that left-sided central auditory processing was significantly correlated with global brain connectivity on fMRI20. This is consistent with the findings of the present study, in which the left ear, but not the right ear, was linked to downstream brain changes. However, another study demonstrated that right-sided hearing loss was associated with more rapid volumetric decline in both temporal lobes, whereas left-sided hearing loss was not associated with volume loss.18 While these findings are the opposite of ours, volumetric changes are distinct from β-amyloid, and β-amyloid aggregation may not be directly related to the brain atrophy commonly observed in Alzheimer’s disease.66

While prior studies examining the association between ARHL and neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer’s disease have adjusted for education,29–31 it may be possible that education is a moderator, not a confounder. In other words, lower education may cause individuals to have worse cognition for a given level of amyloid pathology. It is possible that low education does not actually cause increased amyloid deposition, in which case it would not be a confounder. When we removed education as a covariate, findings were somewhat attenuated, but we observed the same general trends.

From a clinical perspective, the observed association between left ear hearing and β-amyloid burden does not affect management of ARHL. Despite the lateralized observations in this study, bilateral hearing loss should still be treated with binaural hearing aids. For patients with symmetrical ARHL who can only use one hearing aid (e.g., because of costs), we can also not offer a recommendation as to whether the left or right ear is better to treat.

This study has several limitations. For one, this is a post-hoc cross-sectional analysis of the first wave of participants enrolled in the NOMEM-Hearing subcohort. Therefore, causality cannot be determined. We are currently performing additional waves of audiometry and neuroimaging that will allow for longitudinal analysis in the future. Second, this study focused on radiologic evidence of β-amyloid burden rather than cognitive outcomes, meaning a definitive link between worse hearing and cognitive decline cannot be established. However, several previous studies have reported associations between worse hearing and cognitive decline67 and β-amyloid burden and cognitive decline.68,69 This study aims to address the lack of research on the independent relationship between hearing and β-amyloid. Moreover, participants in this study were healthy, late-middle age community volunteers who did not have dementia. This age group is highly unlikely to have advanced cognitive impairment. Because peripheral audiometry is a relatively undemanding task (e.g., it can be performed on children as young as 5 years old), it is unlikely that cognition confounded performance on audiometry.

Another limitation is that power is limited due to the sample size. It is possible that with additional participants, we would have found associations, albeit possibly weaker, between right-ear hearing and β-amyloid. In addition, participants were recruited from a largely Hispanic community in Northern Manhattan, which limits generalizability. However, this is also an advantage as Hispanic people have been historically under-represented in the hearing loss literature. The majority of participants had normal hearing or mild hearing loss, as expected from a middle-aged community sample. However, this limits power to detect associations present only in greater levels of hearing loss. It is possible that once hearing loss is severe enough, there are no longer differential associations between β-amyloid and the right versus left ear. Also, hearing tests were not conducted in a soundproof booth, as is standard practice in clinical audiometry. For logistical reasons epidemiologic studies often perform audiometry in quiet environments outside a soundproof booth. We previously describe these methods.15 Briefly, several safeguards were taken including preselecting locations with extremely low ambient noise, using headphones that maximally attenuate ambient noise, and employing continuous ambient noise monitoring with visual alerts if sound exceeded 45 dB A. If the ambient noise exceeded this level, the test was halted. The system used has been clinically validated21 and used in prior studies.70 Administration of hearing in noise tests, such as the speech-in-noise test, would be beneficial to include in future studies to identify functional deficits in hearing and how they relate to changes in β-amyloid. The preliminary findings in the present study should be replicated in larger cohorts from multiethnic populations with a broad range of hearing loss to expand generalizability. Lastly, we controlled for several potential confounders, but it is possible that other confounders exist, including confounders that are not yet known.

This study has several strengths. Hearing was measured objectively with audiometry as opposed to subjectively with self-report. Findings were consistent across two different measures of hearing: pure tone average and word recognition score. This is also one of the largest studies to examine the association between audiometric hearing loss and a brain biomarker for dementia. Finally, participants were drawn from the community, which should lead to less bias than a convenience-based sample at a healthcare practice.

Conclusion

Worse hearing in the left ear, but not the right ear, was associated with higher β-amyloid burden, a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. These findings may be related to right ear advantage as well as hemispheric lateralization of auditory processing. However, further research is needed to validate these findings.
