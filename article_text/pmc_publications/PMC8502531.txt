The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) functions at the molecular nexus of cell death, survival, and differentiation. In addition to its contribution to neurodegenerative diseases and nervous system injuries, recent studies have revealed unanticipated roles of p75NTR in liver repair, fibrinolysis, lung fibrosis, muscle regeneration and metabolism. Linking these various p75NTR functions more precisely to specific mechanisms marks p75NTR as an emerging candidate for therapeutic intervention in a wide range of disorders. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of p75NTR binding to neurotrophins have shown efficacy in models of Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegeneration. Here, we outline recent advances in understanding p75NTR pleiotropic functions in vivo, and propose an integrated view of p75NTR and its challenges and opportunities as a pharmacological target.

pmcPleiotropic biological functions of p75NTR

p75NTR plays a central role in a wide range of biological processes including regulation of cell death and survival, scar formation, energy expenditure and the hypoxic response and through these processes contributes to biological functions vital for tissue repair, metabolism and neurodegeneration. These pleiotropic functions have been identified in vivo in relevant animal models including neurological, metabolic, and fibrotic diseases. Emerging evidence for the role of p75NTR in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has led to an ongoing clinical trial targeting p75NTR in AD patients. Although these disease-relevant biological functions make p75NTR a promising target for diverse pathologies, they also present challenges due to the pleiotropic functions of p75NTR in the brain and the periphery. The manifold functions of p75NTR in vitro have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [1–3]. Here, we provide an overview on the in vivo functions of p75NTR and the challenges and opportunities for its pharmacologic targeting in disease.

p75NTR – structure &amp; function

The p75 neurotrophin receptor, or p75NTR (also known as nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR)), was first cloned by Dan Johnson and Monte J. Radeke [4, 5] and recognized as a receptor for all neurotrophins (NTs) (see Glossary), including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). Named according to its molecular mass, p75NTR belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, and is a single transmembrane-spanning protein with an amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and carboxy-terminal intracellular domain (ICD) with a flexible juxtamembrane adaptor protein-binding region, followed by a globular death domain (DD). Four cysteine-rich domains in the p75ECD control receptor conformation and ligand binding (Figure 1) [6]. The mechanism of p75NTR activation by NTs involves a rearrangement of disulfide-linked receptor dimers, resulting in the separation of intracellular DDs [7]. In addition to all NTs, the p75ECD binds pro-neurotropins (proNTs), amyloid-β (Aβ), prion protein peptide 106–126 (PrP), and rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) [3, 8]. p75NTR lacks intrinsic catalytic activity, and activates signaling cascades via co-receptors and intracellular adaptor proteins. For example, p75NTR can interact with tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptors to enhance its binding specificity and affinity to mature NTs, with NogoR and Lingo-1 to mediate axonal growth inhibitory effects of CNS myelin, with sortilin to initiate apoptosis signaling of proNTs, and with PKA to regulate cAMP [1, 8, 9]. In addition, p75NTR undergoes proteolytic cleavage by α-secretases, such as ADAM metalloprotease and γ-secretase (regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP)), which releases soluble ICD with cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling functions. The hierarchical activation of p75NTR downstream pathways is determined by competitive protein-protein interactions [10–12]. Indeed, depending on the nature of its co-receptors and cytoplasmic interaction partners, p75NTR mediates diverse and sometimes opposing cellular effects (Table 1, Figure 1, reviewed by [1, 3, 6, 13]).

Cell Death &amp; Survival

The effect of p75NTR on cell death or survival depends upon the ligands and co-receptors [14, 15]. P75NTR null mice have approximately 50% less dorsal root ganglion neurons across different sensory neuron subtypes, which may be due to impaired NT signaling, although the underlying mechanism is unclear [16]. Interestingly, neuron-specific deletion of p75NTR results in no embryonic deficits, but postnatally 20% of neurons are lost selectively within the nonpeptidergic nociceptor lineage, suggesting that p75NTR is required for establishment of postnatal sensory neuron diversity [17]. Inappropriate innervation of sympathetic neuron targets in p75NTR null mice and BDNF+/− mice suggests that BDNF binding to p75NTR might regulate sympathetic pruning. Indeed, in vivo experiments in sympathetic eye-projecting neurons revealed that BDNF signaling via p75NTR causes locally-defined axon elimination, largely by inhibiting the TrkA-mediated signaling that is essential for axon maintenance [18]. During development and following injury, p75NTR can act as an apoptotic receptor. ProNT binding to p75NTR can induce apoptosis of oligodendrocytes after spinal cord injury (SCI) [19], of corticospinal neurons after axotomy [20], and of basal forebrain neurons after seizure [21], and blockade of p75NTR reduces ischemic cell death [22]. ProNT activation of p75NTR in Müller glial cells of the retina induces a TNFα-dependent death of retinal ganglion cells in a non-cell-autonomous way [23]. Apoptotic activity of p75NTR induced by proNTs requires interaction with sortilin as a p75NTR co-receptor [24], and signals via activation of caspase-3 [25], in contrast to other death receptors that signal via the extrinsic, caspase-8-dependent pathway. Moreover, NT receptor-interacting factor (NRIF), a p75NTR effector protein, is required for p75NTR-mediated apoptosis in sympathetic [26] and hippocampal neurons [27]. Although most studies of p75NTR-mediated cell death have focused on proNT-induced cell death, ligand-independent apoptotic signaling by p75NTR has also been shown to promote apoptosis, potentially by dimeric conformational changes [28, 29].

Cell differentiation &amp; Growth

p75NTR is a key player in the regulation of cell differentiation and neuronal growth [3, 30]. p75NTR null embryos show deficits in outgrowth of thoracic intercostal nerves and display delayed development of axonal limb and ophthalmic branches, and p75NTR null adult mice have deficits in sensory and sympathetic target innervation [16, 31]. Unligated p75NTR is a potent activator of RhoA signaling, and NTs suppress this effect. In addition, myelin ligands, such as Myelin Associated Glycoprotein (MAG), can bind to the Nogo receptor (NgR), a GPI-linked p75NTR co-receptor. MAG strengthens the association between p75NTR and the Rho-GDP dissociation inhibitor (Rho-GDI), and prevents Rho-GDI from inhibiting RhoA, thus leading to RhoA activation. Consistent with this model, MAG-induced growth inhibition is attenuated in sensory and cerebellar granule neurons derived from p75NTR null mice. Overall, p75NTR serves as an on/off switch for RhoA activation, and ligands (such as NT and MAG) modulate the level of RhoA activation.

Scar Formation &amp; Regeneration

Scar formation by activated astrocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) inhibits tissue repair and regeneration in the brain and periphery, respectively [32] (Table 2). p75NTR is expressed in HSCs and astrocytes and is a key regulator of scar formation in liver and brain [33–35]. In the liver, p75NTR regulates regeneration by promoting HSC differentiation into myofibroblasts through activation of the small GTPase Rho [33]. At later stages following injury, secretion of pro-NGF or NGF by regenerating hepatocytes may lead to ligand-induced p75NTR-mediated activation of apoptotic pathways in HSCs. These findings have been confirmed in independent rodent models of liver fibrosis [36].

In the brain, expression of p75NTR is upregulated in astrocytes following injury, which promotes reentry into the cell cycle by upregulating CDK2 expression [35], as well as hypertrophic reactivity [34, 35]. Astrocyte p75NTR is cleaved in response to the profibrotic factor transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and the p75ICD interacts with nuclear pore complex nucleoporins to promote nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors required for glial scar formation. Notably, this nuclear pore interaction does not occur in neurons, indicating cell-specific regulation of intramembrane proteolysis of p75NTR might contribute to cell type differences in the composition of the nuclear pore complex and growth factor signal transduction pathways [34].

Fibrinolysis &amp; Tissue Fibrosis

Fibrinolysis is required for fibrin degradation, ECM remodeling and tissue repair, and its inhibition leads to excessive fibrin deposition resulting in inflammation, scar formation, and reduced regeneration [37]. p75NTR inhibits fibrinolysis independent of NTs by interacting with phosphodiesterase PDE4A4/5, which leads to cAMP degradation, reduced PKA activation, downregulation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) [38]. Expression of p75NTR in Schwann cells inhibits fibrinolysis in sciatic nerve injury, whereas p75NTR null mice have increased fibrin clearance and are protected against lung injury [38]. Rolipram, an inhibitor of all PDE4s, reduces fibrin deposition in LPS-induced lung fibrosis [38], and reduces alveolar fibrin deposition in a model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury [39]. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), PDE4A4, the human analog of PDE4A5, is upregulated [40] and is considered a pharmacologic target [41]. Characterization of the p75NTR/PDE4A4/5 interaction revealed that it is mediated primarily by a unique region in the extreme C-terminus of PDE4A4/5 not shared by other PDE4 isoforms [9], suggesting PDE4A5-p75NTR interaction is an appealing precision drug target given its well characterized interface and upstream regulators. Further understanding of the cell types and injury states in which p75NTR and PDE4A4/5 are co-expressed might reveal additional opportunities for p75NTR-PDE4A4/5 based therapies for fibrin clearance.

Obesity &amp; insulin resistance

p75NTR is expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle and liver, and is a central regulator of glucose metabolism and obesity [42, 43]. Genetic loss of p75NTR improves glucose tolerance, increases insulin sensitivity, and significantly improves the suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin [42]. Furthermore, p75NTR null mice are protected from high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and insulin resistance through significantly enhanced energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, hepatic, and adipose tissue [43]. In adipocytes, the p75ICD forms a complex with Rab5 and Rab31 to regulate Glut4 plasma membrane translocation [42]. p75NTR also directly interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA) and regulates cAMP signaling in adipocytes, leading to decreased lipolysis and thermogenesis. Adipocyte-specific depletion of p75NTR or transplantation of p75NTR-null white adipose tissue into wild-type mice fed a HFD protects against weight gain and insulin resistance, identifying p75NTR/PKA signaling as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome [43].

In addition to these peripheral actions, the role of NTs in hypothalamic feeding circuits suggest that p75NTR may also be a candidate to influence food-entrainable behaviors. Indeed, p75NTR expression in neurons within the arcuate hypothalamus is required for food anticipatory behavior in response to daytime-restricted feeding [44]. However, future studies are needed to determine if p75NTR regulates PKA signaling in the CNS, and how p75NTR-regulated metabolism and food-entrained clocks impact metabolic health.

Hypoxia

p75NTR undergoes oxygen-dependent cleavage by γ-secretase to provide a positive feedforward mechanism required for the adaptive response to low oxygen tension, a condition known as hypoxia [45]. Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which regulates a battery of genes involved in cell migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism and inflammation. Stabilization of HIF-1α during hypoxia is controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase seven in absentia homolog 2 (Siah-2), which targets prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) for proteasomal degradation. Reduction in oxygen levels stimulates γ-secretase-dependent release of p75ICD and its interaction with Siah2, which decreases autoubiquitination. Siah2 then targets PHDs for proteasomal degradation, which results in HIF-1α stabilization [45]. Hypoxia and upregulation of Hif1-α contribute to a wide range of diseases including tumorigenesis, ischemic disorders and neurologic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Regulation of hypoxic responses by p75NTR cleavage demonstrates an oxygen-dependent signaling mechanism upstream of PHDs and ubiquitin ligases. Thus, targeting the hypoxia-dependent cleavage of p75NTR could have wide-ranging therapeutic effects.

p75NTR functions in nervous system pathologies

Central nervous system diseases

Retinal injuries

In the retina, p75NTR has been primarily associated with axon guidance, NT-mediated neuronal apoptosis and ischemic retinopathy. In retina-specific p75NTR null mice, ephrin-A reverse signaling is impaired, disrupting axon repulsion and mapping during visual system development [46]. p75NTR expression is confined to Müller glial cells, where it may reduce Müller cell supportive functions or promote the release of proapoptotic factors to induce retinal degeneration [23, 47] (Table 2). Supporting this non-cell-autonomous role for p75NTR in retinal degeneration, genetic loss of p75NTR prevents basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) reduction and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) production by Müller glial cells in response to proNGF, resulting in increased retinal ganglion cell and photoreceptor survival [23].

p75NTR is a major player in ischemic vascular diseases in the eye, such as diabetic retinopathy and oxygen-induced retinopathy, which can cause visual impairment and eventually blindness [48]. p75NTR null mice have decreased stabilization of HIF-1 and VEGF expression, leading to decreased retinal angiogenesis [45]. Thus, in retinal diseases characterized by HIF-1α dysregulation, such as ischemic retinopathy, the p75ICD–Siah2 interaction might be a therapeutic target for regulating oxygen-dependent angiogenesis and tissue remodeling.

Multiple Sclerosis and spinal cord injury

Multiple approaches have been used to investigate the role of p75NTR function in demyelinating diseases, leading to some discrepant results [49, 50]. Although genetic loss of p75NTR does not affect oligodendrocyte death and subsequent remyelination in the MS model of cuprizone-induced demyelination [51], p75NTR can mediate death of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and influence myelinating processes after SCI [19]. These diverging results likely reflect context-dependent differences in p75NTR expression, and the effect of the inflammatory environment. Interestingly, in addition to oligodendrocytes, p75NTR is upregulated in endothelial and perivascular cells of the CNS at the vascular interface in several animal models of MS, suggesting that p75NTR might be crucial for the regulation of blood-brain-barrier integrity and the extent and composition of inflammatory infiltrates during inflammatory demyelination [49, 50, 52]. Although p75NTR impairs neovascularization and blood flow recovery in a mouse model of limb ischemia by suppression of signaling mechanisms implicated in endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis [53], the link between p75NTR expression in injured endothelial and perivascular cells has not been investigated during inflammatory demyelination.

Alzheimer’s disease

A growing body of evidence indicates that p75NTR might contribute to AD pathogenesis [54]. Studies performed on p75NTR deficient mice indicate that Aβ can directly activate p75NTR-mediated cell death through the selection of downstream death effectors [55]. AD is also characterized by abnormal aggregation of tau protein, and p75NTR expression has been associated with tau hyperphosphorylation. Antagonizing the binding of Aβ to p75NTR in mouse models of human tauopathies suppresses tau hyperphosphorylation [56, 57]. Moreover, inactive variants of p75NTR internalize more slowly than wild-type p75NTR, reducing amyloid precursor protein (APP) internalization and colocalization with beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) and favoring non-amyloidogenic APP cleavage [58]. However, loss of p75NTR has differing outcomes on Aβ-related pathology depending on the AD mouse model [59]. Altogether, these in vivo studies favor a potential mechanism for a feed-forward loop of amyloidogenesis regulated by Aβ/p75NTR/BACE1 interactions in AD.

Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that the soluble p75ECD is protective against Aβ toxicity in AD. p75ECD levels in cerebrospinal fluid and in brains of AD patients and in APP/PS1 (AD) transgenic mice are significantly reduced [60]. The sheddase-TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, also called ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17)) is the main enzyme to cleave p75NTR and release its ECD, and TACE activity is significantly reduced in brains of AD mice and CSF of AD patients. Aβ reduces TACE expression and shedding of p75ECD, indicating that reduction of soluble p75ECD in AD is a downstream toxic action of Aβ [60]. Remarkably, restoration of normal p75ECD levels by transgenic expression of human p75ECD before or after Aβ deposition reversed behavioral deficits and AD-type pathologies in a mouse model. Furthermore, transgenic expression of p75ECD also reduced amyloidogenesis by suppressing beta-secretase expression and activity [60]. Overall, these data indicate that p75ECD might act as a neurotoxin scavenger for Aβ and proNTs, preventing their signaling through full-length p75NTR and, therefore, represents a compelling therapeutic target and biomarker in AD.

Cognitive impairment

p75NTR acts as a critical regulator for cholinergic forebrain neuron function and hippocampal synaptic plasticity, which affect learning and memory [15, 61, 62]. Cholinergic neurons highly express p75NTR, and germline deletion of p75NTR increases cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus [63], suggesting that p75NTR is a negative regulator of hippocampal function. However, a more recent study showed that deletion of p75NTR alters cholinergic innervation of barrel cortex but not hippocampus [64]. A key component of working and spatial memory is persistent firing of entorhinal cortex pyramidal neurons. p75NTR controls excitability and persistent firing of the cortical pyramidal neurons in a proNGF-dependent way [65]. p75NTR null mice have improved working memory, but also display increased propensity for severe seizures. Therefore, the proBDNF-p75NTR axis may control pyramidal neuron excitability and persistent activity to balance entorhinal cortex performance with the risk of runaway activity that can result in epileptic seizures [65].

Persistent modifications of synapses include either strengthening or weakening of synaptic connections, respectively termed long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Synaptic plasticity is tightly controlled by NTs, and an emerging concept is that proBDNF and mature BDNF, through their respective p75NTR and TrkB receptor-signaling systems, elicit opposing effects on synaptic plasticity. p75NTR null mice have impairments in several learning and memory tasks [66, 67] and are deficient in LTD [68]. P75NTR null mice also show decreased expression of NR2B, an NMDA glutamate receptor subunit uniquely involved in LTD, and activation of p75NTR by proBDNF enhances NR2B-dependent LTD and NR2B-mediated synaptic currents, suggesting that activation of p75NTR by proBDNF facilitates hippocampal LTD [69, 70]. Interestingly, p75NTR null mice are resistant to age-dependent disruption of hippocampal homeostatic plasticity, as well as age-related memory and cognitive deficits, supporting the notion that p75NTR might mediate age-related increased LTD over LTP [71]. However, cognitive dysfunction of p75NTR null mice could also be attributed to a role of p75NTR in adult neurogenesis. p75NTR is expressed in subventricular zone and hippocampal progenitor cells, and regulates their cell fate [72]. Newborn neurons generated from hippocampal neural stem cells contribute to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, and abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis occurs in CNS diseases, such as AD. Collectively, these studies underscore the emerging view of p75NTR as a contributor to cognitive impairment in AD and aging, and highlight p75NTR as an important therapeutic target for limiting AD- and age-related memory and cognitive function deficits.

p75NTR as a pharmacological target

As p75NTR functions through various modes of action, four major classes of p75NTR-modulating agents are considered for pharmacologic manipulation: 1) modulators of p75NTR expression, 2) inhibitors of p75ICD interaction with its partners, 3) agents blocking p75NTR cleavage, and 4) agents blocking ligand binding to p75ECD (Figure 2, Table 3).

Genetic tools altering p75NTR expression

In vivo knockdown of p75NTR expression using antisense oligonucleotides prevents sensory neuron degeneration after axotomy in rats when administered to the proximal nerve stump [73], and reduces inflammation and demyelination in an animal model of MS [50]. In the rat retina, shRNA targeting of p75NTR expression prevents proNGF-induced acellular capillary formation [74] and abrogates Müller glia activation and inflammation [75]. Noninvasive intranasal delivery of siRNA blocking the induction of p75NTR expression after traumatic brain injury (TBI) prevents proNT-induced neuronal cell death and preserves sensorimotor function [76], highlighting the potential benefit of inhibiting p75NTR signaling as a therapeutic approach to prevent secondary progressive brain damage after TBI.

Cell-permeable peptides interfering with intracellular signaling

Cell permeable peptides can competitively inhibit interactions of p75NTR with its downstream partners, abrogating p75NTR signaling. Tat-pep5, which inhibits the interaction between p75ICD and Rho-GDI and prevents p75NTR-induced activation of RhoA, induces axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush [77]. Moreover, Tat-pep5 attenuates isoflurane-mediated loss of synapses in the hippocampus [78], reduces the lesion volume after TBI [79] and improves learning and memory in mice receiving proBDNF infusions in the hippocampus [77, 80].

The soluble form of c29, a 29-amino acid peptide mimic of the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of p75NTR, inhibits neuronal cell death, whereas the plasma membrane bound c29 peptide induces neuronal cell death, suggesting that membrane localization of the p75NTR cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region is required to activate the death pathway and that c29 can act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of p75NTR death signaling [81]. Acute c29 application to axotomized motor neuron axons decreases cell death, and systemic c29 treatment of SOD1G93A mice, a common model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, resulted in spinal motor neuron survival at mid-disease as well as in delayed disease onset [82]. Soluble c29 promoting motor neuron survival is suggested to enhance the activation of TrkB-dependent signaling pathways in neurons in conditions of low-level NT exposure [82].

Blocking p75NTR cleavage

Peptide inhibitors of α-secretase and γ-secretase prevent the proteolytic cleavage of p75NTR and thereby prevent p75ICD-mediated biological functions. Inhibition of p75NTR cleavage by γ-secretase may represent a strategy to counteract p75NTR functions in AD, such as p75ICD-induced cell death. However, γ-secretase processes a wide range of integral membrane proteins, some of them with critical cellular functions, and targeting γ-secretase in AD has failed in clinical trials, resulting in significantly increased risk of serious adverse events [83]. Thus for clinical use, it may be necessary to design secretase inhibitors that selectively lower p75NTR cleavage events without interfering with the cleavage of other important substrates.

Blocking interaction of p75NTR with extracellular ligands

The interaction of p75NTR with NTs can be blocked using small molecules, peptide inhibitors or antibodies [84]. A cyclic decapeptide that mimics the binding site of NGF for p75NTR decreases the size of β amyloid-induced brain inflammation [85], modulates kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting in a rat model of epilepsy [86] and decreases post-axotomy retinal ganglion cell death [87]. Various antibodies (e.g. REX) can also be used to block NT binding to p75NTR. In vivo application of REX results in decreased myelin sheath thickness in sciatic nerve axons by inhibiting BDNF from binding to p75NTR [88], and leads to altered firing patterns and synaptic composition of abducens motoneurons via inhibition of NGF binding to p75NTR [89].

In silico screening has identified small molecule ligands that interact with p75NTR and modulate its signaling pathways, marking a milestone for p75NTR as an emerging candidate for therapeutic intervention [90] (Figure 3). Small molecule ligands (e.g. THX-B, LM11A-24 and LM11A-31) effectively downregulate degenerative and upregulate trophic signaling in animal models of disease, such as in retinal diseases, TBI, SCI, peripheral neuropathy, Diabetes, Huntington’s disease, HIV, aging, tauopathy, and AD (Table 3) [47, 91–107]. The small molecule LM11A-31 stimulates the recruitment of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) survival adaptor to p75NTR and upregulates downstream NF-ҡB and Akt pro-survival signaling. LM11A-31 significantly improves bladder function and promotes functional recovery after SCI [91, 108], reverses spatial memory impairments after TBI [92], ameliorates cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy [93], prevents diabetes-induced retinal vascular permeability [94], and suppresses neurodegeneration in HIV and aging [95]. LM11A-31 also interferes with proNT degenerative signaling, promoting survival signaling through p75NTR to inhibit/reverse AD degeneration and slowing progression of AD [96–100], and LM11A-31 inhibits multiple aspects of the development of tau pathology, including degeneration of neurites and spines [100, 101]. The effectiveness of altering p75NTR-coupled signaling networks and in reversing neurite/spine degeneration with a lack of apparent deleterious effects in preclinical studies indicate that LM11A-31 modulation of p75NTR may be an approach with significant therapeutic potential. Excitingly, a modified formulation of LM11A-31 is currently being tested in a phase IIa exploratory endpoint trial in subjects with mild to moderate AD (Clinical Trial Numberi: NCT03069014).

Additional agents have expanded the umbrella of potential pharmacological approaches targeting p75NTR in nervous and non-nervous system disorders. These include the lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), which promotes axonal regeneration after optic nerve crush injury and inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling by interfering with the interaction between NgR1 and p75NTR [109], EVT901, a novel piperazine derivative inhibiting p75NTR oligodimerization, which is neuroprotective, modulates central and peripheral inflammation and improves functional outcome in a model of TBI [110, 111], lithium citrate, which is a potential inhibitor of proNGF and protects hippocampal neuronal cell death [112], and the small molecule NSC49652, which inhibits tumor growth in a melanoma mouse model by targeting the transmembrane domain of p75NTR, inducing receptor activation and cell death in melanoma cells [113].

Concluding Remarks

Given the fundamentally improved understanding of its in vivo functions and induced expression in a wide range of neurological and peripheral diseases, p75NTR represents an emerging target for drug discovery. Small molecule compounds that modulate p75NTR ligand binding are of great interest, and have already shown efficacy in CNS injuries and disease, in particular in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases (Figure 2). Since p75NTR has pleiotropic functions, it will be important to identify if p75NTR-driven diseases share common p75NTR mechanisms to optimize pharmacological approaches targeting of the molecule (see Outstanding Questions). Notably, some p75NTR functions are ligand-independent, indicating that blocking ligand binding may only partially inhibit p75NTR signaling and could potentially leave some detrimental functions of p75NTR intact. Therefore, it will be important to differentiate ligand-dependent cell surface p75NTR signaling from signaling by cleaved fragments, and to define the molecular pathways and interaction sites of intracellular mediators of p75NTR in disease. Targeting specific intracellular mediators of p75NTR, which are required for both ligand-dependent and independent signaling, may have better therapeutic potential than blocking only ligand-dependent signaling. By defining the intracellular mediators of p75NTR signaling and the mechanisms by which they interact with p75NTR, it may be possible to selectively block its deleterious functions while retaining its beneficial effects. Patients with devastating conditions stand to benefit from the successful development of these agents.

Glossary

Neurotrophins (NTs) NTs are a family of proteins that regulate survival, development and function of neurons. The term NT is more generally reserved for four structurally related factors: Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4).

Pro-neurotrophins (proNTs) Neurotrophins are synthesized as precursor proteins that are proteolytically cleaved to form mature neurotrophins. ProNT cleavage can occur either intracellularly by the action of furin or proconvertase, or extracellularly by the action of plasmin, matrix metalloproteinase MMP-7 or MMP-9.

Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) p75NTR is subject to proteolytic cleavage, first by a peptidase- mediated ectodomain shedding, leaving a membrane bound C- terminal fragment (p75CTF) and liberating the ECD, and then by the γ-secretase complex that targets the p75CTF, releasing a soluble intracellular domain (p75ICD) with signaling capabilities.

The TM is involved in membrane sorting of p75NTR. The ICD consists of the juxtamembrane adaptor protein-binding region, the DD and the C-terminal tail. p75NTR is subject to proteolytic cleavage releasing a soluble ICD with signaling capabilities. Selected p75NTR catalytic (red, serine-threonine kinases, protein tyrosine phosphatase, ligase and small GTPase), and non-catalytic (grey, scaffolding- and adaptor-like molecules) partners mediate diverse cellular effects, such as neurite outgrowth inhibition &amp; HSC differentiation, cell survival, cell death, glucose uptake, cell cycle arrest, inhibition of fibrinolysis, hypoxia, lipolysis, energy expenditure, and ECM remodeling (see list of p75NTR interactors in Table 1, reviewed by [1, 3, 6, 13]). Abbreviations: p75NTR; p75 neurotrophin receptor, ECD; extracellular domain, TM; transmembrane domain, ICD; intracellular domain, DD; death domain, CRD; cysteine rich domain. HSC; hepatic stellate cell, ECM; extracellular matrix.

LM11A-31, LM11A-24, THX-B and the KGKE peptide or homologous sequence inhibit proNT binding to p75NTR, EVT901 interacts with the p75NTR CRD1 and inhibits p75NTR pre-oligomerization, NSC49652 interacts with the p75NTR TM domain and induces conformational changes and p75NTR activity, lithium citrate prevents the association of the p75NTR-sortilin receptor complex, s-LOTUS inhibits the interaction between NgR1 and p75NTR, the c29 peptide inhibits p75NTR cytoplasmic juxtamembrane death signaling, and the TAT-Pep5 peptide inhibits p75ICD and Rho-GDI interaction (see list of p75NTR modulating small molecule compounds and peptides in Table 3). Abbreviations: p75NTR; p75 neurotrophin receptor, ECD; extracellular domain, TM domain; transmembrane domain, ICD; intracellular domain, JTM domain; juxtamembrane domain, CRD1; cysteine rich domain 1, NgR1; Nogo receptor 1.

Highlights

p75NTR is a driver of disease pathogenesis in neurological, metabolic, and fibrotic diseases.

p75NTR is highly pleiotropic interacting with multiple ligands, co-receptors, and signaling molecules.

Blockade of p75NTR binding to its ligands or intracellular partners has therapeutic potential.

Tissue-specific selective targeting of p75NTR may avoid potentially adverse on-target effects.
