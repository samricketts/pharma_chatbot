Background:

Most older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) do not receive a timely formal diagnosis, although formal diagnosis is linked to improved outcomes. Little is known about how a recognized formal diagnosis impacts family caregivers, who provide crucial support for older adults experiencing ADRD.

Methods:

We analyzed 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study and linked National Study of Caregiving data for a nationally representative sample of 724 (weighted n=5,431,551) caregivers who assisted an older adult with probable dementia. Probable dementia was determined via previously validated composite measure. We modelled caregiver experiences as a function of recognized formal ADRD diagnosis using weighted, logistic regression and adjusting for relevant older adult and caregiver characteristics.

Results:

Among caregivers who assisted an older adult with probable dementia, those assisting an individual with recognized formal ADRD diagnosis were significantly more likely to report emotional difficulty (aOR: 1.77; p=0.03) and family disagreement over the older adult’s care (aOR: 5.53; p=0.03). They were also more likely to assist with communication during doctors’ visits (aOR: 9.71; p&lt;0.001) and to receive caregiving-related training (aOR: 2.59; p=0.01).

Conclusions:

While a timely ADRD diagnosis may help ensure access to needed supports for older adult and caregiver alike, diagnosis must be linked to support as they navigate resultant complex emotions. Formal diagnosis is linked to caregiver integration with, and support from, the older adult’s team of health care providers; therefore, reducing existing disparities in timely diagnosis is necessary to ensure all caregivers have equal access to support.


pmcINTRODUCTION

In the US, an estimated 6.2 million adults ages 65 and older live with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).1 Individuals with ADRD experience impairments in executive function and memory2 and have unique and significant care needs. If these care needs go unmet, individuals with ADRD experience increased risk for adverse events such as institutionalization and hospitalization.3–6 More than two-thirds (67%) of older adults with ADRD live in the community and meet their care needs primarily through assistance from family and unpaid care partners and caregivers (hereafter, “ADRD caregivers”).7,8 Compared to other family caregivers, ADRD caregivers provide more time-intensive assistance and are more likely to experience burden.7–9

Despite major ramifications of ADRD for affected individuals and their families, a formal ADRD diagnosis can be difficult to obtain. When a diagnosis is made, individuals and families may remain unaware of the diagnosis. A host of factors contribute to underdiagnosis and awareness of ADRD, including: ceiling effects in available cognitive testing, multiple underlying pathologies, lack of reliable biomarkers, heterogeneity in patients’ underlying cognitive reserve, provider discomfort in diagnosis and disclosure, patient or family insight or denial, stigma, and the dynamic nature of the disease.10–12 It is estimated that over half (58.7%) of older adults with probable ADRD do not receive or recognize a formal diagnosis.13 The issue is particularly salient among underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, who are more likely to receive a diagnosis later in the disease progression or not at all.13,14

There is strong interest in expanding early diagnosis of ADRD through new reimbursement opportunities for providers, advances in biomarkers, and more sensitive cognitive testing.12,15–18 Awareness of a formal ADRD diagnosis, especially at earlier disease stages, may improve outcomes for the older adult as they are able to receive treatment for reversible causes, complete advance care planning, and connect to specialized social and medical services.19–21 Little is known about the effect of a recognized, formal ADRD diagnosis on older adults’ family caregivers, who are a critical part of the care team for older adults with impaired cognition. Qualitative studies suggest diagnosis can prompt feelings of concern, grief, isolation, and a declining sense of purpose for caregivers.22–24 However, diagnosis may also help caregivers better understand and plan for current and future care needs22 and, given broad acceptance of caregivers’ critical role in supporting those with ADRD, could improve caregiver recognition and support by the health care team.

Given increasing interest in policies and practices to encourage earlier diagnosis,12,15–18 and recent consensus that evidence remains insufficient to support expanded ADRD screening,25 there is value in understanding effects of formal ADRD diagnosis on caregivers to add to the available evidence regarding potential benefits and/or harms of diagnosis. The present study analyzes data from linked surveys of community-living older adults and their family caregivers, collected in 2017. Among family caregivers assisting older adults with probable dementia, we examine effects of recognized formal ADRD diagnosis on caregiving activities and experiences. This work extends previous literature by applying quantitative methods, drawing on a nationally representative sample, and considering those with probable dementia, regardless of formal diagnosis. Findings are relevant to ongoing efforts to improve supports for ADRD caregivers and increase early detection of ADRD.

METHODS

Data and Sample

This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the 2017 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and its linked National Study of Caregiving (NSOC). NHATS is an annual, in-person survey of Medicare beneficiaries 65 and older. NSOC is a companion survey administered via telephone to family and unpaid caregivers identified by NHATS participants. The present study included 724 (weighted n=5,431,551) family caregivers who assisted a community-living older adult with probable dementia in 2017. Probable dementia was determined using a previously validated composite measure based on NHATS items including self- or proxy-reported formal diagnosis, responses to the AD8 dementia screening tool, and performance on cognitive tests.26 Per Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Board criteria, this study is not considered human subjects research.

Measures

A recognized, formal ADRD diagnosis was determined via older adult or proxy reports of a physician diagnosis of ADRD, collected in NHATS. This measure reflects both a formal diagnosis and awareness of this diagnosis among the older adult and/or their proxy. Other older adult characteristics drawn from the NHATS included: age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, self-reported overall health status, and receipt of assistance with two or more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). ADLs include eating, bathing, toileting, and dressing. An older adult was considered to receive assistance with an ADL if they reported that, in the past month, they received help performing this task and rarely or never performed the task without help.

Caregiver characteristics and experiences of caregiving were drawn from self-reports in the NSOC. Characteristics included: age, sex, race, educational attainment (less than high school, high school, some college), and relationship to the older adult (spouse, child, or other). Experiences of caregiving included measures of burden, caregiving network cohesion, caregiver involvement in co-managing health care, and receipt of role-related supports. Measures of burden included five NSOC items: caregiver reports of experiencing financial, emotional, and physical difficulty related to caregiving, exhaustion (affirmative response to “you are exhausted when you go to bed at night), and feeling overwhelmed (affirmative response to “you have more things to do than you can handle”). Caregiving network cohesion measures included two NSOC items: caregiver reports of doing their “fair share” of caregiving and whether the family disagrees “very much” over the details of the older adult’s care (versus “somewhat” or “not as much”). Caregiver involvement in co-managing health care was measured via four NSOC items which asked caregivers to report whether they had assisted with medication management, medical tasks (e.g. IVs, wound care), care coordination, and attending doctor’s visits with the older adult to remind them of information, help them understand what is being said, or ask questions. Finally, receipt of supports was measured across three NSOC items which queried caregivers on whether they had received respite care, attended a support group, and received role-related training.

Statistical Analyses

Among caregivers who assisted a community-living older adult with probable dementia, we compared caregiving experiences by whether the older adult had a recognized, formal ADRD diagnosis. We modelled experiences of caregiving as a function of formal ADRD diagnosis using weighted, multivariable logistic regression. Models adjusted for underlying characteristics of the caregiver (sex, race, educational attainment, relationship to older adult) and older adult (age, sex, Medicaid enrollment, self-reported overall health status, and receipt of help with two or more ADLs). All models were weighted to account for complex survey design and to provide nationally representative estimates. Analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

RESULTS

Among 724 (weighted n=5,431,551) family caregivers who assisted a community-living older adult with probable dementia, 512 (74.3%) assisted an older adult with recognized formal ADRD diagnosis (Table 1). Caregivers had an average age of 60.1 years, were mostly female (64.9%), white (66.1%), and had attended college (66.4%). Approximately one-half of caregivers reported emotional difficulty (52.5%) or exhaustion (49.4%) and one-quarter (26.4%) reported receiving role-related training.

In models adjusting for older adult and caregiver characteristics (Table 2), caregivers who assisted an older adult with a recognized formal ADRD diagnosis were significantly more likely to report emotional difficulty related to caregiving (aOR: 1.95; p=0.01) and family disagreement over the older adult’s care (aOR: 5.08; p=0.03). When a formal ADRD diagnosis was present, caregivers were less likely to directly manage medical tasks (e.g. ostomy care, IVs, blood testing) (aOR: 0.29; p&lt;0.001), but ten times as likely to attend doctors’ visits with the older adult to help ask questions or relay information to the doctor (aOR: 10.01; p&lt;0.001). Caregivers who assisted an older adult with a recognized ADRD diagnosis were more than twice as likely to receive role-related training (aOR: 2.42; p=0.02).

DISCUSSION

Among a nationally representative sample of family and unpaid caregivers assisting a community-living older adult with probable dementia, awareness of a formal ADRD diagnosis was associated with greater emotional challenges, increased involvement in healthcare provider visits, and higher likelihood of receiving role-related training. While formal diagnosis may increase access to needed supports for older adult and caregiver alike, healthcare systems and providers must acknowledge and address the associated emotional and psychological impacts and family dynamics. These findings demonstrate the complex mix of benefits and drawbacks that a formal ADRD diagnosis may hold for caregivers. The impact of diagnosis on caregivers, and how clinicians and health systems could best connect caregivers with appropriate supportive resources, should be taken into consideration as policymakers and stakeholders weigh the merits of payment reforms and clinical practice guidelines aimed at expanding cognitive screening for older adults.12,15,25

The emotional difficulties faced by caregivers assisting an individual with ADRD are well-documented.8,27 By limiting our sample to those with probable dementia and adjusting for a range of older adult and caregiver factors, the present study extends this work; findings indicate that emotional difficulty may stem not only from witnessing ADRD symptoms, but also from anticipatory concern and family conflict that may arise after assigning these symptoms the label of “dementia”. The US Preventive Services Task Force cited the potential emotional toll of receiving an ADRD diagnosis in a 2020 statement declining to endorse universal cognitive screening for older adults;25 given their critical role in coordinating and providing care for those with ADRD, caregivers’ emotional responses are also worthy of inclusion in these discussions.

Formal ADRD diagnosis may increase caregivers’ access to services and supports and facilitate their involvement in co-managing health care. Most ADRD caregivers report unmet needs for education and resource referrals.8,28 In the present study, formal diagnosis was associated with greater odds of receiving provider-led training, a key component of increasing ADRD caregiver efficacy.29,30 Notably, this benefit of diagnosis can only accrue to caregivers who have access to appropriate supportive services, highlighting a need for future research and programs to investigate and address disparities in resources/service availability, referrals, and use among ADRD caregivers in the early stages of the disease trajectory. Caregivers were also more likely to participate in provider visits when a formal diagnosis was present. Greater caregiver involvement in healthcare delivery may facilitate high-quality, patient-centered care by allowing caregivers greater access to information needed to effectively assist with care planning and self-management while offering providers an additional source of information on the patient’s condition.

Strengths of this study include a nationally representative sample, rich information regarding both caregiver and older adult characteristics, and use of a validated measure of probable dementia which does not rely solely on diagnosis. Notable limitations include cross-sectional study design which precludes causal inference and lack of information on other factors which may impact caregiver experiences, including use of home- and community-based services, ADRD disease stage (although we adjust for functional impairment), and impacts of external factors such as theCOVID-19 pandemic. It could be that emotional distress and family disagreement due to cognitive decline lead to greater likelihood of diagnosis and clear disclosure; the need for supports and services may be even more important if that is the case. Additionally, our measurement of recognized, formal ADRD diagnosis does not include individuals who may have received a formal ADRD diagnosis but are unaware of this diagnosis.

Conclusion

Among caregivers assisting an older adult with probable dementia, a recognized formal ADRD diagnosis is associated with greater emotional challenges, increased involvement in health care interactions, and higher likelihood of receiving training. Findings highlight the importance of providing resources to help both the older adult and their caregivers navigate the complex emotions accompanying ADRD diagnosis. Additionally, as receiving a diagnosis is linked to caregiver integration with, and support from, the older adult’s team of medical providers, increasing timely diagnosis while ensuring equitable access to related supportive services is necessary to improve care for the older adult and to ensure that all caregivers have equal access to training and recognition from the health care system.

KEY POINTS

Key Points:

Family caregivers experience both negative and positive impacts associated with a formal ADRD diagnosis for their care recipient.

Formal ADRD diagnosis is associated with greater caregiver access to training and involvement in co-managing the older adult’s health care.

Formal ADRD diagnosis is associated with caregiver-reported emotional distress and family conflict.

Why does this Matter?

Ongoing policy and practice discussions regarding the value of expanded screening for dementia should acknowledge and consider the impacts of diagnosis not only on persons with dementia, but also on their caregivers. Timely dementia diagnosis for older adults may improve their family caregivers’ efficacy, as diagnosis is associated with access to supportive services and integration with the health care team.
