Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by triplication of human chromosome 21. In addition to intellectual disability, DS is defined by a premature aging phenotype and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology, including septohippocampal circuit vulnerability and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). The Ts65Dn mouse model recapitulates key aspects of DS/AD pathology, namely age-associated atrophy of BFCNs and cognitive decline in septohippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks. We investigated whether maternal choline supplementation (MCS), a well-tolerated treatment modality, protects vulnerable BFCNs from age- and genotype-associated degeneration in trisomic offspring. We also examined the effect of trisomy, and MCS, on GABAergic basal forebrain parvalbumin neurons (BFPNs), an unexplored neuronal population in this DS model. Unbiased stereological analyses of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactive BFCNs and parvalbumin-immunoreactive BFPNs were conducted using confocal z-stacks of the medial septal nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band (MSN/VDB) in Ts65Dn mice and disomic (2N) littermates at 3–4 and 10–12 months of age. MCS trisomic offspring displayed significant increases in ChAT-immunoreactive neuron number and density compared to unsupplemented counterparts, as well as increases in the area of the MSN/VDB occupied by ChAT-immunoreactive neuropil. MCS also rescued BFPN number and density in Ts65Dn offspring, a novel rescue of a non-cholinergic cell population. Furthermore, MCS prevented age-associated loss of BFCNs and MSN/VDB regional area in 2N offspring, indicating genotype-independent neuroprotective benefits. These findings demonstrate MCS provides neuroprotection of vulnerable BFCNs and non-cholinergic septohippocampal BFPNs, indicating this modality has translational value as an early life therapy for DS, as well as extending benefits to the aging population at large.

pmc1. Introduction

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common aneuploidy in humans, with an incidence of roughly 1 in 700 live births (Parker et al., 2010). The result of triplication of human chromosome 21 (HSA21), DS is the primary genetic cause of intellectual disability (Costa and Scott-McKean, 2013; Hartley et al., 2015). In addition to systemic conditions including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal abnormalities, individuals with DS have congenital structural alterations of the brain (Millan Sanchez et al., 2012; Sherman et al., 2007). Volume reductions in the prefrontal and temporal cortices, hippocampus, and cerebellum are observable at a young age (Lott and Dierssen, 2010; Millan Sanchez et al., 2012; Pinter et al., 2001; Rachidi and Lopes, 2008). Functional disturbances in the DS prefrontal cortex and limbic system are linked to neurological impairments in language acquisition, attention, emotional control, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (Costa and Scott-McKean, 2013; Lott and Dierssen, 2010). Individuals with DS also exhibit a premature aging phenotype (Dekker et al., 2021; Franceschi et al., 2019), with many developing the neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by early middle-age. Pathobiologic changes include dysregulation of the endosomal-lysosomal system, deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) (Cataldo et al., 2000; Hartley et al., 2015; Mufson et al., 2021; Perez et al., 2019; Sendera et al., 2000; Startin et al., 2019).

Several murine models have been designed to study critical elements of DS/AD pathology, the most widely used of which is the Ts65Dn mouse. A segmental trisomy model, Ts65Dn mice overexpress 90 protein-coding genes that are orthologous to those found within the long arm of HSA21 (Gardiner et al., 2003; Gupta et al., 2016; Sturgeon and Gardiner, 2011). Fusion of the distal portion of mouse chromosome 16 (MMU16) to a centromeric portion of mouse chromosome 17 (MMU17) results in the formation of a small translocation chromosome (Akeson et al., 2001; Davisson et al., 1993; Kahlem et al., 2004; Reeves et al., 1995). Ts65Dn mice survive to adulthood and recapitulate many of the structural changes found in the brains of individuals with DS (Rachidi and Lopes, 2008), including reduced hippocampal neurogenesis (Bianchi et al., 2010; Insausti et al., 1998; Velazquez et al., 2013), deficits in neuroplasticity and dysfunctional neurotransmission (Kaur et al., 2014; Kleschevnikov et al., 2012a, 2012b, 2004), dendritic spine abnormalities (Belichenko et al., 2004, 2007, 2009), and synapse loss (Kurt et al., 2000; Popov et al., 2011).

In addition to aberrant neurodevelopment, Ts65Dn mice model key aspects of the DS/AD phenotype, including early endosomal defects (Cataldo et al., 2000, 2003), age-associated amyloid-beta precursor protein overexpression (Choi et al., 2009; Millan Sanchez et al., 2012; Salehi et al., 2006; Seo and Isacson, 2005), and age-related loss of BFCNs (Hamlett et al., 2016). BFCNs provide the major cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus and cortical mantle (Mesulam, 2004; Wu et al., 2014). Cholinergic neurons originating in the medial septal nucleus/vertical limb of the diagonal band (MSN/VDB) project to the hippocampus and are essential for explicit memory, while those arising in the nucleus basalis of Meynert/substantia innominata (NBM/SI) project to the cortex and modulate attention and working memory (Ballinger et al., 2016; Mesulam et al., 1983; Muñoz and Rudy, 2014; Rye et al., 1984). Behavioral impairments in Ts65Dn mice in hippocampal-dependent memory and spatial mapping (Ash et al., 2014; Escorihuela et al., 1995, 1998; Hunter et al., 2003a; Hyde and Crnic, 2001; Reeves et al., 1995), sustained attention (Driscoll et al., 2004; Moon et al., 2010; Powers et al., 2016), and hyperactivity (Cooper et al., 2001; Reeves et al., 1995; Whitney and Wenger, 2013) are a reflection of the progressive degeneration of these cholinergic circuits.

Septohippocampal circuit vulnerability is a cardinal feature of both DS and AD. Individuals with DS are born with normal BFCNs that atrophy starting in early childhood (Kish et al., 1989; McGeer et al., 1985; Rachidi and Lopes, 2008). Similarly, intact BFCNs in Ts65Dn mice degenerate starting around 6 months of age (MO), coinciding with cognitive deficits (Granholm et al., 2000; Holtzman et al., 1996; Hunter et al., 2003a; Hyde and Crnic, 2001; Seo and Isacson, 2005). Loss of the cholinergic phenotype within BFCNs of aged Ts65Dn mice (Cooper et al., 2001; Granholm et al., 2000) occurs concomitantly with diminished neurotrophic immunoreactivity and alterations in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity in both the basal forebrain and distal projection sites, including the hippocampus (Chen et al., 2009; Contestabile et al., 2006; Hunter et al., 2003b; Kelley et al., 2016; Seo and Isacson, 2005).

Therapeutic strategies to effectively prevent age-associated cognitive decline in individuals with DS and/or AD are in high demand. One possible treatment is early-life choline supplementation (Strupp et al., 2016). Choline is an essential nutrient critically important for proper function of both the adult and fetal nervous system (Blusztajn, 1998). Its use as a neuroprotective agent arose from studies conducted in wild-type rats demonstrating organizational changes in the septohippocampal circuit of offspring from supplemented dams (Albright et al., 1999; Meck et al., 1989; Sandstrom et al., 2002). Early choline delivery produced life-long cognitive enhancements in behaviors subserved by this circuit including learning, working memory, and sustained attention (Meck and Williams, 1999, 2003; Mohler et al., 2001).

When consumed via the maternal diet, choline passes to the developing infant through both the placenta and breast milk (Caudill et al., 2020). During fetal neurodevelopment, metabolized choline is utilized in the synthesis of acetylcholine, which regulates neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival, as well as synaptic formation and plasticity (Abreu-Villaça et al., 2011; Lauder and Schambra, 1999; Strupp et al., 2016). Choline also plays an important role in membrane biogenesis; its incorporation into phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin are pivotal for cell division, synaptic vesicle regulation, and axogenesis (DeLong et al., 1999; Jackowski and Fagone, 2005; Lauwers et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014). Additionally, as the primary dietary source of methyl groups, choline helps establish the fetal epigenome (Anderson et al., 2012; Blusztajn and Mellott, 2012; Zeisel, 2017). Maternally derived methyl groups are used in the de novo methylation of nascent fetal DNA in utero, assisting in the programming of gene expression in developing tissues (Jiang et al., 2012; Kovacheva et al., 2007; Mellott et al., 2007; Pauwels et al., 2017; Ueland, 2011).

Ts65Dn offspring of dams receiving perinatal MCS perform better in septohippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks with greater attentional focus, emotional regulation, and spatial cognition persisting into old age (12–17 MO) (Ash et al., 2014; Moon et al., 2010; Powers et al., 2017; Strupp et al., 2016; Velazquez et al., 2013). Cognitive improvements were accompanied by increases in hippocampal neurogenesis and cholinergic fiber innervation (Kelley et al., 2016; Velazquez et al., 2013).

In the present study, we sought to determine whether morphological improvements observed in the BFCNs of 4–8 MO Ts65Dn mice following MCS (Kelley et al., 2014a) persisted to 10–12 MO, well after neurodegeneration within the septohippocampal circuit has progressed. We also investigated whether MCS had a neuroprotective effect on basal forebrain parvalbumin neurons (BFPNs) within Ts65Dn mice. This GABAergic component of the septohippocampal circuit, which includes distal projections as well as local network connections (Freund and Antal, 1988; Gulyás et al., 2003), is currently unexplored in the MSN/VDB of trisomic mice.

2. Material and methods

2.1. Mice

Female Ts65Dn (strain #005252) and male C57Bl/6JeiJ x C3Sn. BliA-Pde6b+/DnJ F1 (strain #003647) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and bred at the Nathan Kline Institute. Mice were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle under temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions. Standard cages contained paper bedding and enrichment objects including plastic igloos, t-tubes, and cotton square nestlets. Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Nathan Kline Institute and NYU Grossman School of Medicine, in accordance with NIH guidelines.

2.2. Maternal choline supplementation (MCS)

Upon arrival at the Nathan Kline Institute, breeder pairs were randomly assigned to one of two choline-controlled experimental diets as previously described (Alldred et al., 2018, 2019). Dams assigned to the choline-normal control diet were given rodent chow containing 1.1 g/kg of choline chloride (AIN-76 A; Dyets, Bethlehem, PA). This choline concentration is equivalent to those found in standard rodent chows, and is considered an adequate choline intake for a healthy rodent diet, i. e., not choline deficient. Dams assigned to the choline-supplemented diet received rodent chow containing 5.0 g/kg of choline chloride (AIN-76 A; Dyets), approximately 4.5 times the concentration of choline present in the control diet but still within the appropriate physiologic range for consumption (Detopoulou et al., 2008). Breeder pairs were given ad libitum access to both food and water. Pups born to choline-supplemented (+ = MCS diet) and unsupplemented dams were weaned on postnatal day 21 and genotyped as described by Duchon et al. (2011). After weaning, all offspring were placed on the choline-normal control diet with ad libitum access to food and water. Offspring were kept in mixed genotype housing and aged to approximately 3–4 MO (Y = Young) or 10–12 MO (A = Aged) (Table 1).

2.3. Tissue preparation

Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a ketamine (83 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg) solution and transcardially perfused with cold 0.15 M phosphate buffer (PB). Whole brains were removed from the skull and drop-fixed in a solution of 4% para-formaldehyde in PB and placed on an orbital shaker for 48 h at 4 °C. Brains were post-fixed in a series of sucrose solutions in PB (12%, 18%, and 30%) at 4 °C on an orbital shaker, with a minimum of 24 h in each solution. Sectioning was performed in the coronal plane at 40 μm on a cryostat (CM1860; Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) set to −25 °C. Sections were subsequently stored in 12-well tissue culture plates in a cryoprotectant solution (30% glycerol, 30% ethylene glycol, and 40% PB) (Gautier and Ginsberg, 2021) at −20 °C until immunolabeling.

2.4. Immunolabeling and image acquisition

Free-floating 40 μm sections were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) for 15 min (3 × 5 min) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in a dilution buffer solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 3% normal horse serum, and 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS (Gautier and Ginsberg, 2021). Brain sections were placed on an orbital shaker at 4 °C and incubated for either 36 h in a goat polyclonal anti-body against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; 1:250; AB144P, Millipore Sigma, Temecula, CA), or overnight in a rabbit polyclonal antibody against parvalbumin (1:5000; PV27, Swant, Burgdorf, CH) (Choi et al., 2013; Kaur et al., 2017). Sections were subsequently washed in dilution buffer for 30 min (3 × 10 min) at room temperature and incubated in either Alexa-Fluor donkey anti-sheep 488 secondary antibody (1:500; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) (Buchwalow et al., 2011; Kaur et al., 2018) or Alexa-Fluor donkey anti-rabbit 594 (1:500; Invitrogen) for 2 h on an orbital shaker at room temperature in a darkened room. Sections were rinsed in PBS for 15 min (3 × 5 min), mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, coverslipped using VectaShield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and stored in the dark at room temperature until imaging. Tissue sections through the MSN/VDB were stained as a 1 in 4 series.

Z-stacks of the immunofluorescent sections were imaged on a confocal microscope (LSM510, Zeiss, White Plains, NY) using LSM5 software (Zeiss). Z-stacks of the MSN/VDB were collected using a Plan-Apochromat 10×/0.45 objective at a 2 μm slice interval. Z-stack images of individual ChAT-immunolabeled BFCNs were collected using a Plan-Apochromat 100×/1.4 oil objective at a 0.5 μm slice interval (Gautier and Ginsberg, 2021).

2.5. Morphometric analysis

Morphometric analyses of immunofluorescent labeled z-stacks were performed using COANSI (COunting ANd SIze; https://github.com/RisingTideBiotech/Coansi), a newly developed, custom designed stereology macro for ImageJ (Kelley et al., 2020). COANSI was developed as a freeware alternative to commercial stereology software, and can be used on any computer without the need for a product license. The program was built using java on the ImageJ 1.52a source code. Z-stack quantification was conducted using ImageJ version 1.53c (Rasband and ImageJ, 1997–2018). Analysis parameters for counting, density, and area measurements were determined via a series of optimization trials. Appropriate counting frame number, counting frame size, and sampling fraction were selected through repetitive runs on z-stacks containing low, medium, and high quantities of immunolabeled BFCNs. The shape of the MSN/VDB at different points along the rostrocaudal axis was also taken into consideration when evaluating these parameters. Analysis was performed blinded to age, sex, genotype, and maternal diet.

2.6. Neuronal count and density measurements

ChAT-positive and parvalbumin-positive neuronal counts and density measurements within the MSN/VDB were performed on 10× z-stacks using the optical fractionator stereological probe, called “Count” within the COANSI macro (Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). This tool utilizes a 2D grid to perform unbiased systematic random sampling through a 3D region of interest (ROI) (Ash et al., 2014). 33.3% of the demarcated ROI of each z-stack was systematically sampled using COANSI. Counting frames were overlayed on the stack and the dissector probe constructed such that the researcher could scroll through the entire z-axis within the x and y bounds of each individual counting frame. Count and density measurements for each brain section were conducted in triplicate and averaged to account for the variable start location of generated counting frames. Replicates were analyzed non-consecutively to prevent experimenter bias.

Averaged cell counts per section were multiplied by 3 to account for the sampling factor (33.3%), and then by 4 to account for the series interval (1:4 series) (Glaser et al., 2007; Mouton, 2002). Final quantitation of neuron counts within the MSN/VDB for each brain were estimated by summing the totals of each section analyzed. Cell density per section was determined by dividing the number of neurons counted for a given replicate by the area of the traced ROI, and presented as cells per 100,000 μm2 (Ash et al., 2014; Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). Averaged neuronal densities for each section were averaged across all sections of an animal to establish estimated density per brain.

The ChAT immunostained 3–4 MO cohort contained: Y2N n = 10 (4F/6M), YTs65Dn n = 9 (5F/4M), Y2N+ n = 13 (8F/5M), and YTs65Dn+ n = 11 (5F/6M) mice. The ChAT immunostained 10–12 MO cohort contained: A2N n = 12 (6F/6M), ATs65Dn n = 13 (7F/6M), A2N+ n = 12 (7F/5M), and ATs65Dn+ n = 13 (6F/7M) mice. The parvalbumin immunostained 10–12 MO cohort contained: A2N n = 6 (3F/3M), ATs65Dn n = 6 (3F/3M), A2N+ n = 7 (3F/4M), and ATs65Dn+ n = 7 (4F/3M) mice.

2.7. BFCN size measurements

BFCN size was determined using the Cavalieri estimator probe, called “Point Estimator” within the COANSI macro (Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). Cross sectional area measurements of individual ChAT-positive BFCNs were performed on z-stacks taken at 100× magnification. Smoothing via recursive Kalman filtering was applied to all 100× stacks to diminish gain noise around the periphery of each neuron (Rasband and ImageJ, 1997–2018). A series of crosses was overlaid on each z-stack image. Markers were placed on each cross that fell within the neuron of interest. Crosses were considered to be inside the neuron of interest if the neuronal profile contacted the center of the cross. BFCN area was measured on the z-slice of the widest neuronal profile. The 3–4 MO cohort contained: Y2N n = 4 (1F/3M; 122 cells), YTs65Dn n = 4 (2F/2M; 114 cells), Y2N+ n = 4 (3F/1M; 119 cells), and YTs65Dn+ n = 4 (2F/2M; 119 cells) mice. The 10–12 MO cohort contained: A2N n = 6 (3F/3M; 170 cells), ATs65Dn n = 8 (5F/3M; 234 cells), A2N+ n = 7 (4F/3M; 220 cells), and ATs65Dn+ n = 6 (1F/5M; 162 cells) mice.

2.8. MSN/VDB regional area measurements

The area of the MSN/VDB occupied by ChAT-immunostained neuropil was measured via planimetry using the “Outline” tool in COANSI (Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). The periphery of the region was traced on each 10× z-stack, with care taken to include all ChAT-identified cholinergic fibers projecting from the midline through the entirety of the z-stack. All sections had their luminosity increased by 3 levels within the program to help with visualization of the fibers. The total area of the region for 1 series was calculated by adding the individual area measurements of 5 consecutive sections through the MSN/VDB. The 3–4 MO cohort contained: Y2N n = 8 (4F/4M), YTs65Dn n = 9 (5F/4M), Y2N+ n = 12 (8F/4M), and YTs65Dn+ n = 11 (5F/6M) mice. The 10–12 MO cohort contained: A2N n = 11 (6F/5M), ATs65Dn n = 11 (5F/6M), A2N+ n = 12 (7F/5M), and ATs65Dn+ n = 13 (6F/7M) mice.

2.9. qRT-PCR and microarray validation using cultured DS and 2N fibroblasts

To validate select Ts65Dn findings, human forearm skin fibroblasts from individuals with DS and control subjects (n = 4 per genotype) were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ) and grown in culture as described previously (Cataldo et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010). qRT-PCR was performed in duplicate on total RNA extracted from fibroblasts using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) (Ginsberg et al., 2010a). Taqman qPCR primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were utilized for early endosome marker Rab5 (Hs00991293_g1), BDNF receptor TrkB (Hs01093096_m1), and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh; Hs02758991_g1) (Ginsberg et al., 2010a). Standard curves and cycle threshold (Ct) were employed with standards from total human brain RNA. Negative controls consisted of the reaction mixture without input RNA (Ginsberg et al., 2010a).

For microarray analysis, DS and 2N fibroblasts (n = 4 per genotype) were obtained from Coriell, cultured, and 1 ng of RNA (4–6 replicates per sample) was reverse-transcribed and hybridization probes synthesized by in vitro transcription using 33P incorporation as described previously using the terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification protocol (Alldred et al., 2009; Ginsberg, 2008; Ginsberg et al., 2010a). Radiolabeled TC RNA probes were hybridized to custom-designed cDNA arrays in the Ginsberg laboratory (576 genes per array) and placed in a phosphor screen for 24 h and developed on a phosphor imager (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) (Ginsberg, 2008; Ginsberg et al., 2010a). Array images were standardized to the same brightness and contrast levels. Hybridization signal intensity for each gene was assayed as a ratio of the total hybridization signal intensity (global normalization) of the array utilizing ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare) (Ginsberg, 2008; Ginsberg et al., 2010a).

2.10. Electrophysiology of medial septal neurons (MSNs)

6–8 MO male Ts65Dn (n = 3) and 2N (n = 5) mice were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia, brains removed, and transferred into ice-cold N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) solution (in mM: 12 N-acetyl-cysteine, 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 1.97 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate, 10 MgSO4(7H20), 0.5 CaCl2 (2H20), pH 7.4 with HCl; bubbled continuously with 95% O2/5% CO2) (Chakroborty et al., 2019). Coronal slices (250 μm) containing the MSN were obtained using a vibrating blade microtome (VT1000 S, Leica) in NMDG solution. Slices were transferred to an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF)-containing holding chamber and allowed to recover for 10 min at 32 °C then moved to a chamber containing aCSF at room temperature (22 °C). Standard aCSF solution contained the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 10 D-dextrose equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.3–7.4). Osmolarity was maintained at 310 mOsm. Patch pipettes (4–5 MΩ) were filled with intracellular solution containing the following substances (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 2 MgCl2, 4 NaATP, and 0.4 NaGTP, pH adjusted to 7.3–7.4 with KOH (Sigma).

BFCNs were identified visually via infrared differential interference contrast optics on an Olympus BX51 upright microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Identification of BFCNs was largely based on morphological criteria, including appearance of a large spherical soma. Voltage-gated sodium currents and evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were obtained in voltage-clamp mode while spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs) were obtained in current-clamp mode, acquired at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1322 A-D converter and Multiclamp 700B amplifier and recorded using Clampex 10.4 software (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) (McDaid et al., 2021). For recording, slices were transferred to a recording chamber superfused with aCSF at room temperature at a rate of 2 ml/min. Borosilicate glass electrodes were pulled to a resistance of 3–7 MΩ and series resistance was &lt;20 MΩ. Cells that reached higher resistances during the course of recording were discarded. All recordings were conducted in the presence of 20 μM picrotoxin (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) to limit indirect effects from GABAergic synaptic inputs.

For measurement of voltage-gated sodium currents, membrane voltage potential (Vm) was initially held at −70 mV and voltage-gated sodium channels activated using a series of depolarizing steps. Spontaneous EPSPs were measured using a series of gap-free recordings in current-clamp mode. Evoked EPSCs from BFCNs were obtained using a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode placed in the lateral portion of the MSN. To obtain paired-pulses of evoked EPSCs, we used a 50 ms inter-stimulus interval between pairs of EPSCs, at Vm = −70 mV, and the paired-pulse ratio was calculated as the amplitude of the second EPSC divided by the amplitude of the first EPSC (P2/P1) (Chakroborty et al., 2019). For measurement of inward rectification of AMPA receptors, evoked EPSCs were obtained at a Vm ranging from −70 mV to +70 mV, in 10 mV increments, and recorded at 20 s intervals. To obtain evoked currents at depolarized potentials, the recording solution in the pipette also contained TEA (5 mM) to block potassium currents and QX314 (5 mM) to block voltage-gated sodium currents. In addition, the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 (50 μM) was included in the aCSF, to prevent the occurrence of evoked NMDA currents at depolarized potentials. The number of individual neurons recorded ranged from (n = 5–19) per experiment.

2.11. Statistical analysis

For the quantitative morphometry studies, data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), as well as fold change from unsupplemented groups. Comparisons between groups were conducted in R (R.Core.Team, 2021) via a linear model including the interaction of genotype, maternal diet, and age (3-way ANOVA) (Chambers, 1992), followed by Tukey HSD post-hoc control (Miller, 1981). The contrasts for pairs of each level of genotype X maternal diet X age (e.g., Y2N, Y2N+, YTs65Dn, YTs65Dn+ and A2N, A2N+, ATs65Dn, ATs65Dn+) were evaluated using the fitted linear model. Independent variables evaluated included age, genotype, sex, and maternal diet. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

For qRT-PCR analysis, the ddCT method was employed and statistical analysis between DS and 2N fibroblasts performed by a linear mixed model in R (Alldred et al., 2015a, 2018, 2019), as samples were run in duplicate. For the microarrays, statistical analysis between DS and 2N fibroblasts was performed via a linear mixed model in R due to multiple measures, as described previously in trisomic mice (Alldred et al., 2015a, 2018, 2019). For slice electrophysiology, voltage-gated sodium currents and evoked EPSCs were analyzed using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices), while the frequency and amplitude of sEPSPs was analyzed using Minianalysis software (SynaptoSoft, Fort Lee, NJ) (McDaid et al., 2021). Unpaired t-tests were used to assess differences between genotypes. t-tests were performed using SigmaPlot (Systat, Chicago, IL), and results presented as the mean ± SEM.

3. Results

3.1. MCS rescues BFCN loss in aged trisomic offspring and significantly increases BFCNs in 2N offspring

Quantitative analysis of the number of ChAT-immunoreactive BFCNs in the MSN/VDB was performed using unbiased systematic random sampling (Ash et al., 2014; Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). The number of BFCNs within the MSN/VDB for each group is presented in Table 2. Comparisons between choline-normal diet YTs65Dn and Y2N littermates at 3–4 MO revealed no significant differences in total BFCN counts (Fig. 1A, B). MCS Y2N+ offspring had a mean of 2415.38 ± 125.26 MSN/VDB BFCNs per brain, a significant 1.1-fold increase (p = 0.04) in neuronal number compared to choline-normal Y2N offspring (2134.00 ± 115.18 BFCNs) (Fig. 1B). No significant changes were observed between supplemented YTs65Dn+ offspring and unsupplemented YTs65Dn mice (Fig. 1C). No significant sex differences were found by age, genotype, or maternal diet in MSN/VDB BFCNs in any of the experiments comprising the study (Supplementary Table 1).

Comparisons within the 10–12 MO cohort revealed genotype differences in MSN/VDB BFCN number (Figs. 1D, E; 2C, D). Choline-normal ATs65Dn offspring had a mean of 1666.61 ± 102.17 ChAT-positive neurons in the MSN/VDB, a significant 1.2-fold decrease (p = 0.003) compared to a mean of 2062.16 ± 100.89 BFCNs in A2N littermates (Fig. 1E). Qualitative comparisons of basal forebrain sections showed a decrement in ChAT-staining intensity in aged trisomic mice (Fig. 2D), suggesting a loss of cholinergic phenotype (Granholm et al., 2000). Accordingly, comparisons of YTs65Dn (2225.33 ± 91.77 BFCNs) and ATs65Dn (1666.61 ± 102.17 BFCNs) mice revealed a significant 1.25-fold age-associated loss (p = 0.0002) of cholinergic neurons in the MSN/VDB (Figs. 1G, H; 2B, D). Comparisons between Y2N and A2N mice revealed no significant differences in BFCN number due to aging (Figs. 1G; 2 A, C).

MCS produced a robust protective effect in both A2N+ and ATs65Dn+ offspring (Figs. 1E, F; 2E–H). Analysis of A2N+ offspring revealed a mean of 2347.33 ± 66.98 BFCNs in the MSN/VDB, a significant 1.1-fold increase (p = 0.03) in total BFCN counts compared to unsupplemented A2N mice (2062.16 ± 100.89) (Fig. 1E). ATs65Dn+ mice had a mean of 2312.00 ± 74.10 ChAT-positive neurons in the MSN/VDB, a significant 1.4-fold increase (p = 0.000003) in BFCN number compared to unsupplemented ATs65Dn offspring (1666.61 ± 102.17) (Fig. 1F). Significant increases in the number of MSN/VDB cholinergic neurons were found in all ATs65Dn+ offspring analyzed, indicating rescue of the cholinergic phenotype in this basal forebrain subregion (Fig. 1D). Importantly, no significant differences were found between A2N+ (2347.33 ± 66.98 BFCNs) and ATs65Dn+ (2312.00 ± 74.10 BFCNs) cohorts, highlighting the genotype independent benefit of MCS (Figs. 1D, E; 2G, H).

3.2. MCS rescues BFCN density in aged trisomic offspring

ChAT-immunoreactive BFCN density measurements within the MSN/VDB are presented in Table 2. Comparisons between Y2N and YTs65Dn mice showed no significant genotype differences in ChAT-immunoreactive BFCN density in the 3–4 MO cohort (Fig. 3A, B). No significant differences in MSN/VDB BFCN density were observed by maternal diet between YTs65Dn+ offspring and YTs65Dn counterparts (Fig. 3C).

As with BFCN counts in the MSN/VDB, quantitative analysis revealed significant age- and genotype-associated decreases in neuronal density in trisomic mice at 10–12 MO (Fig. 3D). BFCN density was 16.73 ± 0.86 cells per 100,000 μm2 in ATs65Dn mice, a significant ~20% decrease in neuronal density compared to A2N littermates (20.93 ± 1.10 cells per 100,000 μm2; p = 0.001) (Fig. 3E). A significant ~20% decrease was also observed between ATs65Dn mice (16.73 ± 0.86 cells per 100,000 μm2) and the YTs65Dn group (20.76 ± 0.86 cells per 100,000 μm2; p = 0.003) (Fig. 3H). In contrast, no significant age-associated differences in BFCN density were observed between A2N and Y2N counterparts (Fig. 3G).

The rescue of BFCN number in ATs65Dn+ offspring at 10–12 MO led to a concurrent, significant 1.3-fold increase (21.31 ± 0.81 cells per 100,000 μm2; p = 0.0003) in relative BFCN density compared to unsupplemented ATs65Dn counterparts (16.73 ± 0.86 cells per 100,000 μm2) (Fig. 3F). However, in A2N+ offspring, the significant increase in BFCN number did not significantly increase BFCN density compared to unsupplemented A2N counterparts (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, BFCN density in MCS A2N+ offspring (22.22 ± 0.86 cells per 100,000 μm2) was significantly increased compared to unsupplemented Y2N offspring (19.49 ± 0.95 cells per 100,000 μm2; p = 0.04), suggesting MCS exerts a lasting effect on BFCN density in 2N mice that does not diminish with age (Fig. 3G). This sustained effect on neuronal density is apparent when comparing Y2N+ mice (21.94 ± 0.96 cells per 100,000 μm2) to A2N+ mice (22.22 ± 0.86 cells per 100,000 μm2), and YTs65Dn+ mice (21.03 ± 0.78 cells per 100,000 μm2) to ATs65Dn+ mice (21.31 ± 0.81 cells per 100,000 μm2) (Fig. 3G). A2N+ and ATs65Dn+ littermates did not differ in terms of BFCN density (Fig. 3E).

3.3. MCS alters age-associated changes in BFCN size in trisomic offspring

Morphometric analyses of cholinergic neuron size were performed on 100× z-stacks of individual ChAT-immunoreactive MSN/VDB neurons utilizing the Cavalieri estimator probe (Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). The cross-sectional area of 1260 BFCNs were measured across all 8 groups. Cross-sectional areas are presented in Table 3. No differences were seen in cross-sectional area within the 3–4 MO or 10–12 MO cohorts (Fig. 4A). However, a significant age-associated change in BFCN size was found in Ts65Dn mice that was altered by MCS. A significant, 1.1-fold age-related increase in MSN/VDB cholinergic neuron size in YTs65Dn offspring (230.29 ± 6.71 μm2) compared to ATs65Dn offspring (254.21 ± 6.68 μm2; p = 0.04) was attenuated by MCS (ATs65Dn+ = 238.86 ± 9.67 μm2) (Fig. 4B, C).

3.4. MCS increases MSN/VDB regional area independent of age and genotype

The regional area of the MSN/VDB occupied by ChAT-stained neuropil was measured through 10× z-stacks using planimetry (Kelley et al., 2014a, 2014b). Regional area measurements are presented in Table 4. No significant differences between unsupplemented 3–4 MO littermates were found (Fig. 5A, B). However, MCS significantly increased MSN/VDB regional area by 1.1-fold in Y2N+ (3.19 × 106 ± 8.05 × 104 μm2; p = 0.01) and YTs65Dn+ (3.26 × 106 ± 9.81 × 104 μm2; p = 0.002) offspring when compared to unsupplemented counterparts (Fig. 5B, C).

Comparisons between A2N and ATs65Dn littermates revealed a genotype dependent difference in regional area at 10–12 MO (Fig. 5D, E). ATs65Dn mice had a significant ~10% reduction (2.39 × 106 ± 9.83 × 104 μm2; p = 0.01) in the area of the MSN/VDB containing ChAT-immunoreactive neuropil compared to A2N littermates (2.67 × 106 ± 4.99 × 104 μm2) (Fig. 5E). The intensity of cholinergic immunofluorescent fibers was also diminished in ATs65Dn mice (Fig. 6D). MCS ameliorated regional losses observed in trisomic mice, and MSN/VDB area was significantly increased in MCS offspring compared to choline-normal counterparts independent of genotype. Regional area was significantly 1.3-fold higher in ATs65Dn+ mice (3.14 × 106 ± 5.84 ×104 μm2; p = 7.57 × 10—10) compared to unsupplemented ATs65Dn offspring (2.39 × 106 ± 9.83 × 104 μm2), and 1.2-fold higher compared to the A2N offspring (2.67 × 106 ± 4.99 × 104 μm2; p = 0.00003) (Fig. 5E, F). MSN/VDB area was significantly increased in A2N+ offspring (3.17 × 106 ± 6.89 × 104 μm2), with a 1.2-fold increase (p = 0.00001) compared to A2N offspring (2.67 × 106 ± 4.99 × 104 μm2) (Fig. 5E). Regional area in A2N+ and ATs65Dn+ littermates was not significantly different (Fig. 5E).

Comparisons between 3-4 MO and 10–12 MO groups revealed age-associated decreases in MSN/VDB area that were abrogated by MCS. ATs65Dn mice experienced a significant ~20% reduction (2.39 × 106 ± 9.83 × 104 μm2; p = 0.00006) in the relative area of the MSN/VDB when compared to YTs65Dn mice (2.89 × 106 ± 1.05 × 105 μm2), while 2N mice did not differ as a function of age (Fig. 5G). When compared to the Y2N cohort, MCS offspring, regardless of genotype or age, had significant increases in MSN/VDB regional area. Both Y2N+ (3.19 × 106 ± 8.05 × 104 μm2; p = 0.01) and A2N (3.17 × 106 ± 6.89 × 104 μm2; p = 0.02) offspring had significant 1.1-fold increases in regional area compared to Y2N mice (2.90 × 106 ± 6.89 × 104 μm2) (Fig. 5G). The regional area of YTs65Dn+ (3.26 × 106 ± 9.81 × 104 μm2; p = 0.004) and ATs65Dn+ (3.14 × 106 ± 5.84 × 104 μm2; p = 0.04) offspring were also significantly elevated 1.1-fold compared to Y2N mice (2.90 × 106 ± 6.89 × 104 μm2) (Fig. 5G, H). Strikingly, no significant age-related changes in regional area were observed between Y2N+ (3.19 × 106 ± 8.05 × 104 μm2) and A2N (3.17 × 106 ± 6.89 × 104 μm2), and YTs65Dn+ (3.26 × 106 ± 9.81 × 104 μm2) and ATs65Dn+ (3.14 × 106 ± 5.84 104 μm2) treatment groups, suggesting a long-lasting treatment effect (Fig. 5G). Cholinergic fiber intensity was increased in MCS offspring regardless of age or genotype (Fig. 6E–H).

3.5. MCS rescues BFPN number and density in aged trisomic offspring

To establish whether MCS benefits non-cholinergic cell populations, quantitative analyses of neuron number and density were performed on GABAergic BFPNs located within the MSN/VDB region in aged trisomic mice. Dual labeling of basal forebrain sections for ChAT and parvalbumin confirmed the lack of overlap between these different neuronal populations (Fig. 7). Count and density values for BFPNs are presented in Table 5. No significant sex differences were found by genotype or diet in BFPNs. A comparison by sex can be found in Supplementary Table 2.

Unbiased systematic random sampling between ATs65Dn and A2N littermates revealed significant genotype-dependent decreases in parvalbumin-positive neuron number and density (Fig. 8A, top left and right panels). Choline-normal ATs65Dn offspring had a mean of 1584.00 ± 196.58 BFPNs in the MSN/VDB, compared to 2211.66 ± 127.99 BFPNs in A2N littermates, representing a significant 1.3-fold decrease (p = 0.006) (Fig. 8B, D). BFPN density was 15.20 ± 1.51 cells per 100,000 μm2 in ATs65Dn mice, a significant ~30% decrease (p = 0.04) compared to A2N mice (21.11 ± 2.03 cells per 100,000 μm2) (Fig. 8C, E).

Paralleling findings in BFCNs, MCS rescued BFPNs from degeneration in trisomic offspring (Fig. 8A, bottom right panel). MCS ATs65Dn+ offspring had a mean of 2309.71 ± 157.62 BFPNs in the MSN/VDB per brain, a 1.5-fold increase (p = 0.001) in parvalbumin-positive neuron number compared to ATs65Dn offspring (1584.00 ± 196.58 BFPNs) (Fig. 8F). BFPN density in ATs65Dn+ offspring was significantly increased to 25.26 ± 2.44 cells per 100,000 μm2, a 1.6-fold increase (p = 0.0009) in relative density compared to ATs65Dn offspring (15.20 ± 1.51 cells per 100,000 μm2) (Fig. 8G). No significant differences were found between A2N (2,211.66 ± 127.99 BFPNs; 21.11 ± 2.03 cells per 100,000 μm2) and ATs65Dn+ (2309.71 ± 157.62 BFPNs; 25.26 ± 2.44 cells per 100,000 μm2) mice, indicating a nearly complete rescue of this GABAergic phenotype by MCS (Fig. 8D, E). Interestingly, no significant differences in parvalbumin-positive neuron number and density were found between A2N and A2N+ mice (Fig. 8A bottom left panel, D, E). This observation is in contrast to the significant increases in cholinergic neuron counts observed as a result of MCS in the same A2N+ mice within the same brain region.

3.6. Validation of the Ts65Dn model in the context of BFCN and BFPN deficits by qRT-PCR, microarray analysis, and whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology

To validate in vivo findings in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS in the context of BFCN deficits, we conducted additional confirmatory experiments in culture and by slice electrophysiology. Upregulation of the early endosome marker Rab5 is documented in trisomic mouse BFCNs (Cataldo et al., 2003; Gautier et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2016; Salehi et al., 2006), as well as in postmortem human DS and AD brains (Cataldo et al., 2000; Ginsberg et al., 2011; Ginsberg et al., 2010b). Corroborating these findings by qRT-PCR, we found a significant 2-fold upregulation (p = 0.00002) of Rab5 gene expression in cultured DS fibroblasts compared to 2N controls (Fig. 9A left panel), consistent with protein-based assays in DS fibroblasts (Cataldo et al., 2008). A significant 1.6-fold downregulation (p = 0.00003) of the BDNF receptor TrkB was also observed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 9A right panel), paralleling the loss of TrkB expression in trisomic BFCNs and human postmortem cholinergic basal forebrain neurons (Alldred et al., 2019; Alldred et al., 2021b; Ginsberg et al., 2010a; Ginsberg et al., 2006).

Microarray analysis using RNA harvested from DS and 2N fibroblasts revealed dysregulation of select genes in relevant classes of transcripts (e.g., cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways, among others) similar to findings in trisomic mice. Consistent with in vivo cholinergic deficits (Alldred et al., 2021b), significant downregulation of Ache (p = 0.027) and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 (Chrm1; p = 0.011), along with upregulation of nicotinic cholinergic receptor 7 (Chrna7; p = 0.026), was found in DS fibroblasts (Fig. 9B). Dysregulation of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits NMDA R1 (Nr1; downregulation, p = 0.003) and AMPA GluR1 (Gria1; upregulation p = 0.028) were observed, along with upregulation of early immediate gene FosB (p = 0.029) (Fig. 9B). Additional dysregulation observed in vivo that was paralleled in DS fibroblasts included significant downregulation of nerve growth factor beta (Ngfb; p = 0.019) and upregulation of late endosomal marker Rab7 (p = 0.022) (Fig. 9B).

Ts65Dn BFCNs show evidence of impaired energy production via oxidative phosphorylation (Alldred et al., 2021a), which may make these neurons especially vulnerable to changes in metabolic demand. To this end, we tested trisomic BFCN glutamatergic synapses via whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices. As a measure of presynaptic transmission, we tested the frequency of sEPSPs and the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of evoked EPSCs, and found a significantly increased frequency of sEPSPs in Ts65Dn mice compared to 2N littermates (4.53 ± 1.6 Hz in 2N versus 12.45 ± 3.09 Hz in Ts mice; t(1,6) = −2.55; p = 0.04; Fig. 9C). The PPR of evoked EPSCs was also decreased in Ts65Dn mice compared to 2N littermates (1.46 ± 0.12 in 2N versus 1.02 ± 0.06 in Ts mice; (t(8) = 3.13; p = 0.01; Fig. 9D). To measure glutamatergic signaling properties, we measured the inward rectification index of AMPA glutamate receptors, as well as AMPAR:NMDAR ratios. 2N and Ts65Dn BFCNs at 6–8 MO demonstrated similar inward rectification of evoked EPSCs in response to a series of depolarizing steps from −70 mV to +70 mV, indicating possible Ca2+ permeability, with a rectification index of 2.21 ± 0.24 and 2.28 ± 0.36 in 2N and Ts65Dn littermates, respectively (Fig. 9E). Likewise, there were no differences in AMPAR:NMDAR ratios between the mice (data not shown). There was no significant change in the amplitude of sEPSPs across genotypes (2.12 ± 0.10 pA in 2N versus 2.45 ± 0.12 pA in Ts65Dn littermates) (Fig. 9C), indicating unchanged BFCN postsynaptic AMPA receptor function, including Ca2+ permeability.

The increased frequency of sEPSPs and decreased PPR of evoked EPSCs indicates the presynaptic release probability of glutamate is increased in trisomic mice, which coupled with existing Ca2+ permeability of the BFCN postsynaptic AMPA receptors, may have implications for synaptic energy requirements and Ca2+ signaling in DS. We measured voltage-gated Na+ currents in response to depolarization and found the amplitude of these currents to be significantly decreased in Ts65Dn BFCNs (2121.59 ± 230.77 pA in 2N versus 1218.27 ± 136.76 pA in Ts65Dn littermates; t(26) = 2.93; p = 0.007; Fig. 9F). Although the implications of this observed decrease in trisomic voltage-gated Na+ currents remain unclear, it may affect the function of other voltage gated channels sensitive to changes in action potential amplitude. Taken together, these electrophysiology experiments validate defects in BFCN synaptic properties and point towards glutamatergic synaptic dysfunction, both a cardinal feature of the Ts65Dn mouse model (Alldred et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2021b; Costa, 2008; Kaur et al., 2014) and reflective of individuals with DS (Costa, 2014; Costa and Scott-McKean, 2013).

4. Discussion

We compared morphological changes within vulnerable BFCNs and BFPNs, a largely unexplored GABAergic neuronal population within the MSN/VDB, of young and aged Ts65Dn and 2N offspring following MCS. We found increased maternal choline intake during the perinatal period ameliorated age- and genotype-associated changes in neuronal number, density, and regional area in supplemented offspring. The demonstrated neuroprotective benefits of MCS on cholinergic and non-cholinergic neuronal populations has important translational implications with respect to the use of MCS as a therapeutic intervention in children with DS.

Quantitative analysis of BFCNs using COANSI revealed no significant differences in number, density, or regional area of the MSN/VDB in unsupplemented YTs65Dn and Y2N offspring at 3–4 MO. These findings align with earlier studies showing neurodegenerative onset occurring at roughly 6 MO (Cooper et al., 2001; Granholm et al., 2000; Holtzman et al., 1996; Hunter et al., 2003a). By 10–12 MO, genotype-associated differences in unsupplemented ATs65Dn and A2N littermates were readily apparent. ATs65Dn mice had significant reductions in BFCN number and density compared to A2N littermates and YTs65Dn counterparts. The area of the MSN/VDB region occupied by ChAT-immunoreactive neuropil was also significantly smaller. ChAT-immunostaining in ATs65Dn mice was patchy compared to A2N littermates, and staining intensity significantly diminished compared to YTs65Dn counterparts. This decrement in cholinergic phenotype corresponds with sequencing data published by our lab demonstrating downregulation of the neurotrophins Bdnf, Ngf, Nt3, and Ntf 4/5 and their cognate receptors TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC in both the hippocampus and basal forebrain of Ts65Dn mice at multiple time points (Alldred et al., 2015a, 2015b, 2018, 2019, 2021b). These data are further supported by our qRT-PCR and microarray validation studies of TrkB and Ngfb in DS fibroblasts.

MCS effectively rescued BFCNs from degeneration in ATs65Dn+ offspring. Additionally, average BFCN counts for both ATs65Dn+ and A2N+ mice were higher than unsupplemented young counterparts. Interestingly, BFCNs in ATs65Dn+ and A2N+ offspring stained more intensely than unsupplemented aged mice, suggesting increased cholinergic activity independent of genotype. Single-population expression profiling of BFCNs from 6 MO MCS offspring previously showed upregulation of multiple genes associated with cholinergic synaptic function, including muscarinic cholinergic receptors Chrm1 and Chrm2 in Ts65Dn+ offspring (also supported by the present microarray analysis in DS fibroblasts), and the nicotinic cholinergic receptor Chrnb3 in 2N+ offspring (Kelley et al., 2019).

These data demonstrate age- and genotype-dependent atrophy of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain of ATs65Dn mice that is rescued by perinatal MCS. Target derived neuroprotection of BFCNs likely stems from a restoration of trophic support to the basal forebrain (Strupp et al., 2016). Retrograde transport of NGF is severely impaired in Ts65Dn mice (Cooper et al., 2001; Salehi et al., 2006). Direct infusion of NGF into the basal forebrain of aged Ts65Dn mice was previously found to restore cholinergic phenotype, rescuing BFCNs from degeneration (Cooper et al., 2001). MCS also increases NGF and BDNF levels in adult offspring of supplemented wild-type rats (Glenn et al., 2007; Sandstrom et al., 2002), indicating increased neurotrophic support likely contributes to the rescue of this vulnerable neuronal population.

Importantly, the beneficial effects of MCS appear to be genotype independent. Both YTs65Dn+ and Y2N+ offspring had increased BFCN numbers and MSN/VDB regional area measurements that were retained into adulthood. These results suggest MCS exerts both neuroprotective and neurogenic effects on cholinergic neurons of the MSN/VDB, which has previously been observed in the dentate gyrus of Ts65Dn+ mice (Velazquez et al., 2013) and wild-type rats (Albright et al., 1999; Glenn et al., 2007). Since choline is a precursor to acetylcholine, it is possible increased ontogenetic signaling during development increases neuronal proliferation and survival in the basal forebrain (Abreu-Villaça et al., 2011; Lauder and Schambra, 1999; Schliebs and Arendt, 2011).

Morphometric analysis of BFCN cross-sectional area showed BFCNs from unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice enlarged significantly with age, a change that was prevented by MCS. Increases in BFCN size within unsupplemented Ts65Dn mice may reflect a neuroplastic compensatory response in reaction to the initial loss of cholinergic neurons, similar to the increases in cholinergic activity observed in the hippocampus of patients in the mild cognitive impairment phase of AD (DeKosky et al., 2002; Ikonomovic et al., 2003; Kelley et al., 2014a, 2016; Mufson et al., 2015). Rescue of BFCN number and density following MCS may eliminate compensatory enlargement.

BFCN enlargement in Ts65Dn mice may also occur secondary to increased early endosome pathology (Cataldo et al., 2003; Salehi et al., 2006). Pathological accumulation of early endosomes in the cell soma and proximal dendrites of BFCNs of the MSN/VDB is observable in Ts65Dn mice by 6–8 MO (Cataldo et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2016; Salehi et al., 2006). Prior studies investigating the effects of MCS on the endosomal-lysosomal system indicate that endosomal-lysosomal and autophagy pathway genes are extraordinarily MCS-responsive in Ts65Dn mice (Alldred et al., 2018, 2019; Kelley et al., 2019), and that MCS affects early endosome phenotype in supplemented offspring (Gautier et al., 2022).

The septohippocampal circuit contains both cholinergic and GABAergic fibers (Freund, 1989; Köhler et al., 1984). The cholinergic neurons of the MSN/VDB that project to the hippocampus primarily innervate pyramidal and granule cells, while GABAergic projection neurons innervate hippocampal GABAergic interneurons (Freund and Antal, 1988; Müller and Remy, 2018). Additionally, GABAergic projection neurons in the hippocampus reciprocally project back to the basal forebrain, forming connections with local cholinergic and GABAergic neurons (Gulyás et al., 2003; Müller and Remy, 2018; Takács et al., 2008). We found a significant reduction in BFPN MSN/VDB neuron number and density in ATs65Dn mice compared to A2N littermates. This novel finding provides new evidence of extensive septohippocampal network dysfunction in aged trisomic mice. This is demonstrated in part by the blunted neurophysiological phenotypes in BFCNs, including suppressed Na+ channel currents and altered presynaptic properties, which are suggestive of dampened membrane excitability and increased Ca2+ levels, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis of single population RNA-sequencing of MSN BFCNs in 6 MO Ts65Dn mice has revealed significant downregulation of numerous GABAergic genes and GABAergic neurotransmission pathways (Alldred et al., 2021b).

MCS increased BFPN MSN/VDB neuron number and density in ATs65Dn+ offspring to levels not significantly different than those of unsupplemented A2N counterparts. Whether this rescue results from direct neuroprotective action on MSN/VDB GABAergic neuronal populations, or is a secondary benefit due to salvage of the BFCN connectome, remains to be resolved. Notably, MCS normalized expression of several upregulated GABAA receptor subunits in the hippocampus of Ts65Dn+ offspring at 6 and 11 MO (Alldred et al., 2018, 2019). If decreased MSN/VDB BFPNs represents a loss of phenotype (Heizmann and Braun, 1992; Krzywkowski et al., 1995), similar to BFCNs (Sofroniew et al., 1990), MCS may rescue GABAergic basal forebrain neurons in Ts65Dn mice by a similar mechanism. This may include rebalancing calcium signaling and oxidative phosphorylation, and/or attenuating excitotoxicity (Alldred et al., 2018, 2019, 2021a; Ginsberg et al., 1999).

MCS increases ChAT-immunoreactive BFCN, but not BFPN, number in the MSN/VDB of A2N+ offspring. This finding is significant given the differential effects of aging on cholinergic and GABAergic neuronal populations. Aging studies have demonstrated that while minor cholinergic cell loss in the basal forebrain is expected under normative conditions, GABAergic basal forebrains neurons do not decrease with age (Bañuelos et al., 2013; Krzywkowski et al., 1995; McKinney, 2005). On the contrary, significant age-associated increases in GAD67-immunopositive basal forebrain projection neurons have been observed in rats (Bañuelos et al., 2013). Investigation of age-related changes in BFPN number in Ts65Dn and 2N littermates, and whether MCS has any early-life remodeling effects on GABAergic populations, awaits future study.

It should be noted that there are limitations with respect to the translational applicability of the Ts65Dn mouse model. The translocation chromosome in Ts65Dn mice is crafted from a telomeric portion of MMU16 and a pericentromeric segment of MMU17 (Akeson et al., 2001; Davisson et al., 1990). However, HSA21 genes that are syntenic in mice span MMU16, MMU17, and MMU10 (Sturgeon and Gardiner, 2011). While the Ts65Dn model overexpresses ~90 protein coding genes found on HSA21, estimates place the total number of orthologous HSA21 protein coding genes in mice at ~158, meaning Ts65Dn mice are not trisomic for ~68 genes that are often triplicated in human DS (Gupta et al., 2016). Additionally, the pericentromeric portion of MMU17 in the Ts65Dn translocation chromosome contains ~35 protein coding genes not typically overexpressed in human DS (Gupta et al., 2016). Murine models such as Dp16 (Yu et al., 2010) that contain nearly all triplicated genes on HSA21, without extraneous triplications, have yet to replace the practicality and utility of the Ts65Dn model. While showing physiologic and functional deficits, Dp16 models to date have not reproduced significant behavioral deficits or BFCN degeneration (Chang et al., 2020; Raveau et al., 2018; Sawa et al., 2022), hallmarks of septohippocampal connectome vulnerability in human DS and AD that are recapitulated in Ts65Dn mice. Studies employing perinatal MCS in Dp16 mice may be considered in the future.

Although the exact mechanism(s) by which perinatal MCS exerts life-long effects on supplemented offspring remain unknown, bolstered neurotrophic support and increased neuronal survivability are likely derived from two major processes. The first are organizational brain changes secondary to the role of choline as a precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the phospholipids PC and sphingomyelin (Abreu-Villaça et al., 2011; Derbyshire and Obeid, 2020; Lauder and Schambra, 1999). MCS increases metabolic activity of the hepatic-PEMT pathway (Yan et al., 2014), a biosynthetic pathway that generates PC metabolites that are highly enriched for the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). DHA is found in high concentrations in neuronal membranes and is important for CNS development (Cao et al., 2009; Eilander et al., 2007; Kawakita et al., 2006; Scott and Bazan, 1989; Wurtman, 2008). MCS increases the availability of enriched choline metabolites like PC-DHA during periods of rapid cell division and myelination (Derbyshire and Obeid, 2020; Jiang et al., 2014; Korsmo et al., 2019). Long-term cognitive benefits in adult offspring (McCann et al., 2006; Meck and Williams, 2003; Strupp et al., 2016) likely stem from MCS induced changes in neuronal proliferation and differentiation, membranogenesis, and synaptogenesis during key neurodevelopmental windows (Cansev, 2016; Glenn et al., 2007; Meck et al., 1989; Mellott et al., 2007; Zeisel and Niculescu, 2006). The second avenue stems from the role of choline as a dietary methyl donor (Obeid, 2013). MCS increases levels of bioavailable methyl groups during prenatal establishment of the fetal epigenome (Anderson et al., 2012; Blusztajn and Mellott, 2012; Kwan et al., 2018; Mellott et al., 2007; Pauwels et al., 2017). Gestational changes in fetal methylation patterns likely contributes to the long-lasting phenotypic alterations observed in supplemented offspring (Jiang et al., 2012; Zeisel, 2017).

5. Conclusions

Supplementing the maternal diet with additional choline during gestation and lactation rescues multiple vulnerable basal forebrain neuronal populations from degeneration in an established mouse model of DS and AD. These results support ongoing translational investigations into the use of MCS in DS, as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome (Otero et al., 2012; Ryan et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2007, 2009), Rett syndrome (Nag and Berger-Sweeney, 2007; Nag et al., 2008; Ricceri et al., 2013; Ward et al., 2009), and pediatric epilepsy (Holmes et al., 2002; Wong-Goodrich et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2000), among others. Demand for choline rises significantly during pregnancy, and data suggests current dietary recommendations are inadequate to meet these increased metabolic requirements (IOM, 1998; Wallace et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2012; Zeisel, 2006). As evidenced by the current study, choline has permanent and/or long-lasting organizational benefits to resident neurons of the basal forebrain critical for septohippocampal functions including memory and attention. Increased maternal choline intake may therefore be both an effective neuroprotective therapy for DS, as well as a safe nutritional supplement for optimization of brain development and cognitive function in the general population.

Comparison of age, genotype, and MCS on BFCN cross-sectional area between the 3–4 MO and 10–12 MO cohorts. No significant differences in relative BFCN cross-sectional area were found in disomic or trisomic mice in either age group compared to Y2N mice. B. Comparison of age and MCS on BFCN cross-sectional area in trisomic mice.

Fig. 9. Validation of the DS phenotype seen in Ts65Dn mice within DS fibroblasts and in MSN BFCNs via slice electrophysiology. A. Boxplots illustrate qRT-PCR results for the early endosome marker Rab5 in DS and 2N fibroblasts indicating significant upregulation (left panel) along with concomitant downregulation of BDNF receptor TrkB (right panel). B. Annotated list of dysregulated genes from cholinergic (Ache, Chrm1, Chrna7), glutamatergic (Nr1, Gria1), neurotrophic (Ngfb), and endocytic pathways (Rab7) in DS fibroblasts compared to 2N fibroblasts. C. sEPSPs occurred at a higher frequency, but not amplitude, in MSN BFCNs from Ts65Dn compared to 2N littermates. Representative traces on the right illustrate whole-cell current-clamp recordings from 2N and Ts65DN MSN neurons. The increased frequency of sEPSPs indicates a presynaptic phenomenon reflecting increased release probability of glutamate. D. The PPR is decreased in slices. Pairs of EPSCs evoked at 50 ms intervals showed increased EPSC amplitude on the second pulse compared to the first in 2N mice, resulting in a paired-pulse ratio (PPR, amplitude of P2/amplitude of P1) of mean ~ 1.4. The PPR was decreased in slices taken from trisomic mice (P2/P1 of approximately 1, see trace on right). This decreased PPR, taken along with the observed increase in the frequency of sEPSPs seen in C, indicates that the release probability of glutamate is increased at medial septal synapses in Ts65Dn mice. Both of these presynaptic phenotypes are consistent with increased Ca2+ within presynaptic terminals. E. Synaptically-evoked AMPA currents in MSN neurons from 2N and Ts65Dn littermates display inward rectification. I-V plot indicates the current voltage relationship of evoked AMPA EPSCs using whole-cell voltage-clamp patch recordings from MSNs from 6 to 8 MO 2N (n = 5) or Ts65Dn (n = 3) mouse brain slices. The rectification index (RI) is the ratio of the peak of the evoked EPSC at −70 mV divided by the EPSC peak at +70 mV. Representative trace (top left) illustrates evoked 2N EPSCs at −70 mV and + 70 mV. Bar graph shows averaged RI from Ts and 2N populations which are not different from each other. F. Voltage gated Na+ currents are significantly decreased in MSN BFCNs in Ts65Dn mice. Na+ currents were obtained by depolarization of MSN neurons using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings. Representative traces on the right illustrate large voltage gated Na+ currents observed in both 2N and Ts65DN BFCNs neurons. Error bars on bar graphs indicate SEM. Statistical analysis (A-B) was performed via the contrast test (t-test) based on the fitted linear model. Statistical analysis (C–F) was performed via unpaired t-tests.
