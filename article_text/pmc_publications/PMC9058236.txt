Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) performs incompletely understood biochemical functions that affect pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. ABCA7 is most similar in primary structure to ABCA1, the protein that mediates cell lipid efflux and formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays were employed to investigate lipid efflux in BHK-ABCA7(low expression), BHK-ABCA7(high expression) and BHK-ABCA1 cells. Shotgun lipid mass spectrometry was used to determine lipid composition of HDL synthesized by BHK-ABCA7 and BHK-ABCA1 cells. BHK-ABCA7(low) cells exhibited significant efflux only of choline-phospholipid and phosphatidylinositol. BHK-ABCA7(high) cells had significant cholesterol and choline-phospholipid efflux to apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apo E, the 18A peptide, HDL, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid and significant efflux of sphingosine-lipid, serine-lipid (which is composed of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in BHK cells) and phosphatidylinositol to apo A-I. In efflux assays to apo A-I, after adjustment to choline-phospholipid, ABCA7-mediated efflux removed ~4 times more serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol than ABCA1-mediated efflux, while ABCA1-mediated efflux removed ~3 times more cholesterol than ABCA7-mediated efflux. Shotgun lipidomic analysis revealed that ABCA7-HDL had ~20 mol% less phosphatidylcholine and 3–5 times more serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol than ABCA1-HDL, while ABCA1-HDL contained only ~6 mol% (or ~1.1 times) more cholesterol than ABCA7-HDL. The discrepancy between the tracer efflux assays and shotgun lipidomics with respect to cholesterol may be explained by an underestimate of ABCA7-mediated cholesterol efflux in the former approach. Overall, these results suggest that ABCA7 lacks specificity for phosphatidylcholine and releases significantly but not dramatically less cholesterol in comparison with ABCA1.

pmc1. Introduction

Adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) has strong genetic support for involvement in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). All major genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in European and African ancestry populations have identified sequence variants at the ABCA7 locus that are associated with AD [e.g., 1–5]. Presence of these AD-associated variants at the locus does not by itself signify that the ABCA7 gene bears on AD pathogenesis, i.e., another nearby gene could be the culprit factor affecting the disease, but genome sequencing studies in European and African ancestry individuals have found AD-associated loss-of-function alleles in the ABCA7 gene and not in any other gene at the ABCA7 locus [6–10]. For individuals of European ancestry, the GWAS variants and loss-of-function mutations at the ABCA7 locus raise the risk of AD by, correspondingly, 8%−20% and 100%−400% [1,3,4,7–9]; in African ancestry populations, a common ABCA7 loss-of-function allele increases AD risk by 80% [10].

On the amino acid level, ABCA7 is most similar to ABCA1, a protein that mediates formation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) from cell phospholipid and cholesterol and certain extracellular amphipathic helical proteins, such as apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and E and serum amyloid A [11]. Because HDL formation removes lipid from the cell, this process is frequently called cell lipid efflux. Variants at the ABCA1 locus are also associated with AD but at the nominal (i.e., p &lt; 5 × 10−8) level of significance [1,4]. ABCA7 can mediate HDL formation, but discordant findings have been reported regarding the presence of cholesterol in ABCA7-HDL [12–16]. ABCA7-HDL also differs from ABCA1-HDL in particle size distribution and may differ in phospholipid composition [12,17]. ABCA7 deletion in mice has a broad effect on many lipid species in the brain, especially diacyl, plasmanyl and plasmenyl species of phosphatidylethanolamine [18]. Variants at the ABCA7 locus are associated with plasma dihexosylceramide and many species in the major phospholipid classes [19,20]. The emerging evidence shows that ABCA7 performs a distinct and pleiotropic but yet poorly-understood role in lipid pathophysiology.

Elucidation of the ABCA7-specific biochemical functions would further along understanding of AD pathogenesis and potentially foster development of an ABCA7-inspired AD therapy. Toward this goal, in the present work, we used cell lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays and shotgun lipid mass spectrometry to investigate specificity of ABCA7-mediated lipid efflux in comparison with ABCA1-medaited efflux in cell models heterologously expressing a low or a high level of human ABCA7 or a high level of human ABCA1. The results demonstrate that ABCA7-mediated efflux lacks the very strong preference for phosphatidylcholine characteristic of ABCA1-mediated efflux and releases much more of non-choline-containing phospholipid and moderately less of cholesterol in comparison with the ABCA1-mediated process.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Cell lines and cell culture

BHK-ABCA1 and BHK-PS4 cells were made in the laboratory of the late Dr. John Oram using the GeneSwitch system (now available from Thermo Fisher Scientific) [21] and were a kind gift of Dr. Chongren Tang. Dr. Oram’s group first stably transfected BHK cells with the pSwitch vector to derive BHK-pSwitch lines; these cells were then transiently transfected with pGene/V5-His/lacZ and assayed for β-galactosidase activity to determine which line supported the highest level of reporter expression, which was the BHK-PS4 line. Full-length human ABCA1 in pGene-V5/His A was stably integrated into the latter line to derive BHK-ABCA1 cells [21]. The complete coding portion of the human ABCA7 cDNA was cut from the pENT223-ABCA7 plasmid (Transomic Technologies, Huntsville, AL) as a BsrGI fragment and ligated into the Acc65I-cut and dephosphorylated pGene-V5/His A plasmid; the resultant plasmid was cut with SpeI and PmeI, the larger fragment was treated with the Klenow fragment to fill in the SpeI overhang and ligated on itself to remove the V5 epitope and polyHis tag (Supplementary Fig. 1). Sequencing of the ABCA7 cDNA in the latter plasmid showed that the ABCA7 sequence contained the coding 4580C&gt;G (A [GCT] &gt; G [GGT] at the amino acid position 1527) mutation, which is the GWAS AD-associated variant rs3752246 (the minor risk-conferring G allele at this variant is the reference allele, while the major, i.e., wild-type, protection C allele is the alternative allele). This plasmid was therefore called pGene-ABCA7(A1527G). A QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was used to change the G nucleotide to C at the 4580 position and to introduce K847M and K1833M mutations in the ABCA7 Walker motifs. pGene-ABCA7 (i.e., wild-type) and pGene-ABCA7(K847M/K1833M) were transfected into BHK-PS4 cells using lipofectamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and several stable lines were isolated. Cell lines were routinely maintained in high glucose, sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine-containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in 5% CO2 without any antibiotics.

2.2 Western immunoblotting

Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as recommended by the buffer manufacturer. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Supernatant aliquot portions containing 20 μg of protein were heated at 60°C for 10 minutes in 1X sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer, resolved on 4 to 20% Tris-Glycine SDS protein gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; the membrane was treated with Western Blocker solution for horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection systems (Sigma-Aldrich) and probed with either a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino acids 1871–2008 of the human ABCA7 (sc-377335; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a rabbit polyclonal ABCA1 antibody (NB 400–105; Novus Biological), followed by application of a secondary antibody labeled with HRP. The membrane was then immersed into Luminata Crescendo Western HRP substrate (EMD Millipore) and imaged using an ImageQuant LAS4000 imager (GE Healthcare). Gel quantification was done using ImageJ.

2.3 Cell fractionation into the plasma membrane and cytoplasm

Plasma membrane was isolated as described in ref. 22. Cells were grown in 12-well plates to near confluence and treated with 10 nM mifepristone for 16–18 h. To biotinylate cell surface, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), kept in ice-cold PBS/1 mM MgCl2/0.1 mM CaCl2 for 15 m at 4°C, incubated in 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4)/150 mM NaCl/0.5 mg/mL EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 4°C with gentle shaking and soaked in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/150 mM NaCl/100 mM glycine for 15 m at 4°C to stop biotinylation. The cells were then collected by scraping in 500 μL/well of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/150 mM NaCl, centrifuged at 1000g for 10 m at 4°C and re-suspended in 500 μL/well of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10 mM KCl/1.5 mM MgCl2/1 mM sodium EDTA/1 mM sodium EGTA/250 mM sucrose/protease inhibitor cocktail. To lyse the cells, the cell suspension was forced through a ball-bearing homogenizer (isobiotec, Heidelberg, Germany) set to 10 μm clearance 13 times. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 3000g for 10 m at 4°C and added to 0.6 mg of 0.8 μm NanoLink streptavidin magnetic beads (TriLink Biotechnologies, San Diego, CA) (the beads were washed and re-suspended in 250 μL of 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4)/150 mM NaCl/0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin before addition of the homogenate) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were then pelleted using a MagRack 6 (GE Healthcare), the supernatant was collected, and the beads were washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10 mM KCl/1.5 mM MgCl2/1 mM sodium EDTA/1 mM sodium EGTA/250 mM sucrose/protease inhibitor cocktail for 10 min, followed by seven 10 m washes in 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5)/5 μM biotin/protease inhibitor cocktail and one wash in PBS using the MagRack 6. Finally, the beads (i.e., the plasma membrane fraction) were resuspended in 100 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCL (pH 7.5)/ 150 mM NaCl/3 mM biotin/6 M urea/2 M thiourea/2% (w/v) SDS, incubated at room temperature for 15 min and heated at 95°C for 15 min. The supernatant (i.e., the cytoplasm fraction) was concentrated to 100 μL using Microcon-10 kDa centrifugal filter units with Ultracel-10 membrane (MilliporeSigma). The same volumes (either 10 μL or 20 μL, depending on the well size of a protein gel) of the plasma membrane and cytoplasm fractions were resolved on 4 to 20% Tris-Glycine SDS protein gels, and protein distribution between the fractions was assessed using Western immunoblotting.

2.4 Metabolic labeling of cell lipids and cell lipid efflux assays

Confluent cells were trypsinized and seeded into 24-well plates at 1/10 dilution or 1.5 × 105 cells per well and grown overnight in DMEM/10% FBS. The cells were then incubated with 2 μCi/mL [methyl-3H]-choline chloride and 0.24 μCi/mL [4-14C]-cholesterol (both from PerkinElmer), 5 μCi/mL D-erythro-[4,5-3H]-dihydrosphingosine, 0.25 μCi/mL [1,2-14C]-ethanolamine hydrochloride, 56 μCi/mL L-[3-3H]-serine or 30 μCi/mL myo-[1,2-3H(N)]-inositol (all from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Saint Louis, MO) over the following night in DMEM/2.5% FBS and treated with 10 nM mifepristone or vehicle for 16–20 h over the third night in DMEM/0.2% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid free, EMD Millipore). Lipid efflux was initiated by adding apo A-I, apo E or 18A to 10 μg/mL or HDL to 100 μg/mL in DMEM, human plasma diluted to 2% with DMEM or DMEM without lipid acceptors to the cells. Mifepristone (or vehicle for controls), was present in media during the efflux step to maintain expression of the transgene. Efflux continued for 4 h. Then, cell medium was collected, centrifuged to pellet floating cells, transferred to a new tube, and lipids were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method. Cell lipids were extracted using hexane-isopropanol (3:2, v/v). Lipid extracts were transferred to scintillation vials, the solvent was evaporated, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter. Cholesterol efflux was calculated as the percentage of counts in medium from the total of counts in cells and medium. For the cells exposed to medium without an acceptor or to medium with the same acceptor, the average value for lipid efflux from cells treated with vehicle was subtracted from individual values for lipid efflux from cells treated with mifepristone. The resultant values represented non-specific ABCA7/ABCA1-induced lipid release in the absence of acceptor (for the cells exposed to acceptor-free medium) and non-specific ABCA7/ABCA1-induced lipid release plus ABCA7/ABCA1-mediated efflux to an acceptor. Apo A-I and HDL were isolated from human plasma at the Lipoprotein Core of the Lipid Research Group at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia as previously described [23]; apo A-I was stored in 6 M guanidine HCl and dialyzed extensively in PBS before use; HDL was stored in KBr and transferred to PBS using PD-10 desalting columns immediately before use. 18A was synthesized at the Temple University Moulder Center for Drug Discovery Research. Efflux to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was conducted by the same protocol, except cells were seeded in 96-well plates, and CSF was diluted to 33% in DMEM for the total volume of 75 μL/well. Plasma and throwaway CSF were purchased from commercial sources. Plasma and CSF were from single individuals and not pooled. CSF samples had normal protein and/or glucose levels.

2.5 Accessibility of plasma membrane cholesterol to cyclodextrin

Cells were plated, labeled with 2 μCi/ml [1,2-3H(N)]cholesterol (PerkinElmer) and treated with mifepristone as in the lipid efflux assays. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated in ice-cold 10 mg/mL methyl-β-cyclodextrin/PBS for 4 min on ice. Cell medium was collected, and a 100 μL aliquot of it was read in a scintillation counter. Cell lipids were extracted and cholesterol efflux was calculated as in the cholesterol efflux assays.

2.6 Large scale HDL formation in vitro

BHK-ABCA7 cells with a high expression of ABCA7 and BHK-ABCA1 cells were plated into T75 flasks (12 and 6 T75 flasks per sample for BHK-ABCA7 and BHK-ABCA1 cells, respectively) at 1/10 dilution from confluent cultures and grown to confluence in DMEM/10% FBS/antibiotics. The cells were then treated with 10 nM mifepristone in DMEM without FBS for 16–18 h to induce ABCA7 and ABCA1 expression, washed with DPBS and incubated in 10 mL/flask of DMEM with 10 nM mifepristone and either 5 μg/mL of apo A-I for BHK-ABCA7 cells or 10 μg/mL of apo A-I for BHK-ABCA1 cells for 5–6 h to allow for HDL formation. Apo A-I was prepared from human plasma as above. At the end of incubation, cell medium was forced through 0.22 μm pore size polyethersulfone syringe filters into 50 mL conical tubes to remove floating cells; HDL was concentrated by reducing the volume of cell medium to 1.5 mL using 10,000 NMWL Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units, stored at −80°C and shipped for lipidomic analysis on dry ice. Three samples of each ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL were prepared sequentially and independently.

2.7 HDL lipid analysis by shotgun lipidomics

Lipid composition of HDL was determined using multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics [24]. In brief, 1 ml of each HDL sample was accurately transferred to a disposable glass tube; a mixture of lipid internal standards was added, and then lipid extraction was performed using a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure [25]. The samples were diluted to 500 fmol total lipid per μL and analyzed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Altis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) and a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA), both equipped with an automated nanospray device (TriVersa NanoMate, Advion Bioscience Ltd., Ithaca, NY), as described [26]. Identification and quantification of lipid species were performed using an automated software program [27, 28].

2.8 Statistical analysis

One-way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparison by keeping the false discovery rate at 0.05 (using the two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli) was used when more than two sample groups were compared. Unpaired two-tailed t test was used to compare two sample groups. Mean and standard deviation were plotted in all graphs and included in the text. Graphing and data analysis were conducted with GraphPad Prism 9.1.2.

3. Results

3.1 Localization of ABCA7 to the plasma membrane at a low and a high expression level

Several lines of BHK cells expressing human ABCA7 under control of a mifepristone inducible promoter were made. The line with the lowest (line 3) and a line with some of the highest (line 5) expression of the protein were selected for further investigation (Fig. 1A). Based on western immunoblotting, BHK-ABCA7(high) cells had 3.8 (±1.3, n = 4) times more ABCA7 than BHK-ABCA7(low) cells. ABCA7 expression could be also detected in BHK-ABCA7(high) cells without mifepristone treatment, i.e., this line had a leaky expression of the transgene. Isolation of plasma membrane protein using cell surface biotinylation showed that ABCA7 was almost completely sequestered to the plasma membrane in BHK-ABCA7(low) cells and was much more prevalent in the plasma membrane than the cytoplasm in BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (Fig. 1B). Isolation of plasma membrane protein in BHK-ABCA1 cells was conducted in parallel as a control and showed similarly predominant localization of ABCA1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). Catalytically inactive ABCA7 with K847M and K1833M mutations in the Walker motifs of the nucleotide-binding domains also localized predominantly to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1D).

3.2 ABCA7-mediated cholesterol and choline-phospholipid efflux to apo A-I, apo E and plasma in metabolic labeling/tracer lipid efflux assays

In choline-phospholipid (radioactive choline labels phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin [29]) and cholesterol dual radiolabeling assays, BHK-ABCA7(low) and BHK-ABCA7(high) cells treated with mifepristone to induce expression of the transporter had significant efflux of choline-phospholipid to apo A-I and apo E ε3; induced ABCA7(low) cells had detectable but not statistically significant choline-phospholipid efflux to plasma, while induced ABCA7(high) cells had significant choline-phospholipid efflux to plasma (Fig. 2A, left panel). Choline-phospholipid efflux from induced ABCA7(high) cells to apo A-I, apo E ε3 and plasma was significantly and, correspondingly, 2.5 (±1.5, n = 3), 4.0 (±2.8, n = 3) and 3.5–4.8 (n = 2 after excluding a very high outlier value) times higher than efflux of this lipid from induced ABCA7(low) cells to the same acceptors. The higher levels of choline-phospholipid efflux in ABCA7(high) relative to ABCA7(low) cells were proportional to the greater amount of ABCA7 protein in the former versus the latter cells (i.e., 3.8 ±1.3 times greater ABCA7 amount in ABCA7(high) than ABCA7(low) cells; from Section 3.1). Induced ABCA7(low) cells had minimal and not statistically significant efflux of cholesterol to apo A-I, apo E and plasma, while cholesterol efflux to the three acceptors was significant in induced ABCA7(high) cells (Fig. 2A, right panel). Mifepristone-treated BHK-ABCA1 cells had significant efflux of choline-phospholipid to apo A-I, apo E ε3 and plasma, significant efflux of cholesterol to apo A-I and apo E ε3 and detectable but not statistically significant efflux of cholesterol to plasma (Fig. 2B). The ratio of cell cholesterol to choline-phospholipid efflux (i.e., the percentage of cell cholesterol efflux divided by the percentage of cell choline-phospholipid efflux) was calculated for ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated efflux from, correspondingly, ABCA7(high) and ABCA1 cells. Higher cholesterol/choline-phospholipid ratios indicate that greater amounts of cholesterol were removed from the cell per the same amount of choline-phospholipid. The cholesterol/choline-phospholipid ratios for ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux to apo A-I, apo E and plasma were significantly higher than the corresponding ratios for ABCA7-mediated efflux (Fig. 2C). ABCA1-mediated efflux to apo A-I, apo E and plasma removed, correspondingly, 2.9 (±0.4, n = 3), 4.1 (±0.6, n = 3) and 3.3 (±0.5, n = 3) more of cholesterol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid than ABCA7-mediated efflux.

3.3 ABCA7 does not affect the state of cholesterol in the plasma membrane

Changes in the state of the plasma membrane cholesterol brought about by ABCA7 and ABCA1 were assessed using cyclodextrin [30]. As previously reported [31], ABCA1 increased the pool of plasma membrane cholesterol available for extraction by cyclodextrin (i.e., the pool of active cholesterol [30]) in BHK-ABCA1 cells. ABCA7, in contrast, had no effect on the pool of cyclodextrin-accessible cholesterol in the plasma membrane of BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (Fig. 3).

3.4 ABCA7 mediates lipid efflux to HDL, the synthetic 18A peptide and CSF, requires intact nucleotide-binding domains for activity and does not distinguish between the apo E ε3 and ε4 isoforms

ABCA7 maintained significant efflux of choline-phospholipid to HDL in both BHK-ABCA7(low) and BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (Fig. 4A). ABCA7-mediated choline-phospholipid efflux to HDL was similar in magnitude to efflux of this lipid to apo A-I and apo E in both cell lines, but induced ABCA7(high) cells released 3.6 (±1.5, n = 3), 3.6 (±1.1, n = 3) and 2.7 (±0.4, n = 3) times more choline-phospholipid to, correspondingly, HDL, apo A-I and apo E than induced ABCA7(low) cells. 18A (also called 2F) is a synthetic amphipathic helical peptide that can support strong ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux [32,33]. In dual [3H]choline and [14C]cholesterol lipid efflux assays, both induced ABCA7(low) and ABCA7(high) cells had significant choline-phospholipid efflux to 18A; however, no cholesterol efflux to 18A could be detected from induced ABCA7(low) cells, while induced ABCA7(high) cells had detectable and significant cholesterol efflux to 18A (Fig. 4B). Induced BHK-ABCA1 cells, used as a control, exhibited strong efflux of choline-phospholipid and cholesterol to 18A. Several CSF samples derived from patients with diagnosed or suspected neurological conditions were acquired from commercial sources. Some of these CSF samples supported significant choline-phospholipid efflux from mifepristone-treated BHK-ABCA7(low) and BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (e.g., CSF 1; Fig. 4C), while other CSF samples did not support choline-phospholipid efflux from any cell lines, including BHK-ABCA1 (data not shown).

Several lines of BHK cells expressing mutated (containing the K847M and K1833M mutations in the Walker motifs in the nucleotide-binding domains), catalytically-disrupted ABCA7 under control of a mifepristone-inducible promoter were made, and the line with the highest ABCA7(K847M/K1833M) expression was selected for further investigation. ABCA7 expression in BHK-ABCA7(K847M/K1833M) cells was higher than in BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (Fig. 1D). Mifepristone-treated ABCA7(K847M/K1833M) cells did not exhibit any detectable choline-phospholipid efflux (Fig. 4D). ABCA7-mediated choline-phospholipid efflux from induced ABCA7(high) cells was the same to apo E ε3 and ε4 isoforms (Fig. 4E).

3.5 Survey of ABCA7-mediated phospholipid efflux using metabolic labeling/tracer lipid efflux assays

Metabolic labeling of major cell phospholipids was used to survey ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated phospholipid efflux to apo A-I and plasma. Radioactive D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine labels ceramide and ceramide derivatives, including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids, which localize preferentially to the plasma membrane [34]. Induced BHK-ABCA7(low) cells did not efflux a detectable amount of sphingosine-lipid to apo A-I, while induced BHK-ABCA7(high) and BHK-ABCA1 cells exhibited significant sphingosine-lipid efflux to apo A-I and plasma (Fig. 5A). The bulk of phosphatidylethanolamine in BHK cells is synthesized from phosphatidylserine by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase even in the presence of plentiful exogenously-added ethanolamine, and long-term incubation with radioactive serine labels primarily the aminophospholipids phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine [35]. There was no significant serine-lipid efflux from induced ABCA7(low) cells to apo A-I or from induced ABCA7(high) cells to plasma; significant serine-lipid efflux was detected from induced ABCA7(high) cells to apo A-I and from induced ABCA1 cells to apo A-I and plasma (Fig. 5B). Radioactive myo-inositol labels phosphatidylinositols [29]. There was significant efflux of phosphatidylinositol from induced ABCA7(low) cells to apo A-I and from induced ABCA7(high) and ABCA1 cells to apo A-I and plasma (Fig. 5C). The ratios of cell sphingosine-lipid, serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol efflux to choline-phospholipid efflux (%/%) to apo A-I were calculated for ABCA7(high) and ABCA1 cells using the percentages of choline-phospholipid efflux to apo A-I from Fig. 2A and B. This was done to assess whether there were differences between ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated efflux with respect to phospholipid: higher ratios would indicate that greater amounts of sphingosine-lipid, serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol were removed from the cell per the same amount of choline-phospholipid. There was no significant difference between the ABCA7 and ABCA1 sphingosine-lipid/choline-phospholipid ratios; however, the ABCA7 serine-lipid/choline-phospholipid and phosphatidylinositol/choline-phospholipid ratios were significantly higher than the corresponding ABCA1 ratios (Fig. 5D). The ABCA7 serine-lipid/choline-phospholipid and phosphatidylinositol/choline-phospholipid ratios were divided by the corresponding ratios for ABCA1. ABCA7-mediated lipid efflux removed 3.7 (±1.0, n = 3) times more of serine-lipid and 3.8 (±1.3, n = 3) times more of phosphatidylinositol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid than ABCA1-mediated efflux.

3.6 Lipid composition of ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL determined using shotgun lipidomics

ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL were raised at a large scale using BHK-ABCA7 cells with a high ABCA7 expression, BHK-ABCA1 cells and human apo A-I. The ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL samples contained 39.9 (±3.6, n = 3) nmol and 41.0 (±1.6, n = 3) nmol, respectively, of the total phospholipid (i.e., phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid) per sample (~30 μg of phospholipid per sample). Lipid composition ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL was analyzed using multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics [24]. As the molar fraction (mol%) of the total phospholipid, ABCA7-HDL contained significantly less of phosphatidylcholine (63.2 ±2.3 mol% versus 82.5 ±3.6 mol%, i.e., ~20% less) and significantly more of phosphatidylethanolamine (8.1 ±0.3 mol% versus 2.6 ±0.2 mol%), phosphatidylserine (7.8 ±0.5 mol% versus 2.9 ±0.8 mol%), phosphatidylinositol (1.8 ±0.18 mol% versus 0.42 ±0.05 mol%), phosphatidylglycerol (2.5 ±0.20 mol% versus 0.51 ±0.10 mol%) and phosphatidic acid (0.81 ±0.1 mol% versus 0.20 ±0.03 mol%) than ABCA1-HDL; ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL did not differ significantly in the content of sphingomyelin (Fig. 6A and B; Supplementary Table 1 contains raw data). As the mol% of the total phospholipid and cholesterol, ABCA7-HDL contained significantly less cholesterol than ABCA1-HDL, but this difference was not large (60.3 ±2.8 mol% versus 66.1 ±0.8 mol%, i.e., only ~6% less; Fig. 6C). ABCA7-HDL contained significantly more lysophosphatidylethanolamine than ABCA1-HDL; and the two HDL species had the same levels of lysophosphatidylcholine, triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester (Fig. 6D, E). On the molar basis, ABCA7-HDL contained 3.4 (±0.2) and 5.0 (±0.5) times more, correspondingly, serine-lipid (i.e., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine) and phosphatidylinositol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid (i.e., phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine) than ABCA1-HDL; on the other hand, ABCA1-HDL contained 1.11 (±0.01) times more cholesterol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid than ABCA7-HDL. The latter value was the same whether only free cholesterol was considered or the total amount of free and esterified cholesterol was used, because esterified cholesterol was a minor fraction of the total cholesterol, and ABCA7- and ABCA1-HDL had the same mol% of it.

4. Discussion

In the present work we investigated lipid specificity of ABCA7-mediated efflux in comparison with ABCA1-mediated efflux using the complementary methods of cell lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays and shotgun lipid mass spectrometry. The two methods are in a very good agreement regarding the phospholipid specificity of ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated efflux. Lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays showed that ABCA7-mediated efflux has a preference for non-choline-containing phospholipids and releases ~4 times more serine-lipid (i.e., phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in BHK cells, [35]) and phosphatidylinositol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid to apo A-I than ABCA1-mediated efflux. Shotgun lipid mass spectrometry-based analysis of HDL made by ABCA7 or ABCA1 with apo A-I revealed that indeed ABCA7-HDL contains ~20% less phosphatidylcholine and 3–5 times more serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid than ABCA1-HDL. As has been previously reported [36], ABCA1-HDL contains triacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester; ABCA7-HDL also contains similar amounts of these neutral lipids. However, in contrast to another previous report that ABCA7-HDL may contain more lysophosphatidylcholine than ABCA1-HDL [12], in the present study ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL had the same concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine, while ABCA7-HDL had more lysophosphatidylethanolamine. Sphingosine-lipid and serine-lipid efflux was not evident in BHK-ABCA7 cells with the low ABCA7 expression likely because of very little formation of HDL in these cells and inefficient metabolic labeling of these phospholipid species. Overall, the findings from both methods strongly support a lower specificity for phosphatidylcholine on the part of ABCA7.

With respect to cholesterol, cell lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays and shotgun lipid mass spectrometry-based analysis of HDL concur that ABCA7-mediated efflux removes significantly less cholesterol than ABCA1-mediated efflux but vastly diverge about the magnitude of this difference. While efflux assays indicated that ABCA1-mediated efflux to apo A-I removes ~3 times more cholesterol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid than ABCA7-mediated efflux, mass spectrometry-based analysis of HDL made by ABCA7 or ABCA1 with apo A-I set this number at only 1.1 times and showed that ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL have similar concentrations of cholesterol. Furthermore, cholesterol efflux could be detected in BHK-ABCA7 cells with the high but not the low level of ABCA7 expression. These disagreements in the result between the two methods and two levels of ABCA7 expression in heterologous cells are reminiscent of the discord presently existing in the literature [12–16]. Because cholesterol, unlike phospholipid, can readily diffuse through the aqueous milieu [30,37], there is likely to be a degree of its loss to diffusion from HDL to hydrophobic surfaces of laboratory ware. The extent of this diffusion as a fraction of the total cholesterol release/total cholesterol in HDL could be greater when cholesterol efflux and HDL formation are low because of a small scale of experiments and low activity of the transporter. In the present study, the tracer efflux assays were conducted on a much smaller scale than HDL formation procedures (24-well plates versus T75 flasks), and ABCA7 activity was about 5 times lower in terms of choline-phospholipid efflux to apo A-I in BHK-ABCA7(high) cells and still more lower in BHK-ABAC1(low) cells than ABCA1 activity in BHK-ABCA1 cells (Fig. 2A and B). Therefore, in the present work, the tracer efflux assays may involve an underestimate of ABCA7- relative to ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. The shotgun lipidomics of HDL likely reflect ABCA7-mediated cholesterol efflux more faithfully and indicate that ABCA7 mediates a moderately lower cholesterol efflux than ABCA1. This finding corroborates the reports that ABCA7 supports substantial cell cholesterol release [15,17].

ABCA7 and ABCA1 are frequently thought to function as outward (from the inner to the outer monolayer of the plasma membrane) transbilayer phospholipid translocases, i.e., proteins that transport the charged headgroups of phospholipids through the hydrophobic middle of the lipid membrane and thus flip phospholipids from one side of the membrane to the other [11]. Accumulation of phospholipid in the outer monolayer at the expense of the inner monolayer is then thought to induce strain in the whole membrane and cause it to form an outwardly protruding lipid domain whose distinct physicochemical properties permit it to readily bind apolipoproteins [11,38]. Our present findings regarding the specificity of ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux are in line with the results of the previous study that showed preferential translocation of non-choline-containing phospholipids by reconstituted ABCA7 and preferential translocation of phosphatidylcholine by reconstituted ABCA1 in liposomes [39]. In contrast to phospholipids, which have half-lives for spontaneous transbilayer flip and aqueous diffusion on the order of days [37,40], cholesterol can flip between the monolayers in a bilayer almost instantaneously and has a two-hour half-life for aqueous diffusion [30,37]. For these reasons, it has been suggested that ABCA1 does not transport cholesterol directly but affects it indirectly as a consequence of the changes in lipid membrane morphology and physicochemical properties [11]. The present work supports this hypothesis. Cholesterol has higher solubility in bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine than non-choline-containing phospholipids [41,42]. Correspondingly, ABCA1-HDL has higher concentrations of both phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, while ABCA7-HDL has lower concentrations of these lipids. In fact, the cholesterol concentration in ABCA1-HDL in the present study (i.e., 66 mo% of the total phospholipid and cholesterol) is at the limit of cholesterol solubility in phosphatidylcholine bilayers [41]. The cholesterol concentration in ABCA7-HDL is also likely to be at the limit of its solubility for bilayers with a low phosphatidylcholine content. HDL formation and tracer lipid efflux in the present work took place as soon as cells reached confluence and began adapting to crowding by reducing levels of intracellular free and esterified cholesterol [43,44]. Because of this, the cells had large amounts of cholesterol available for release and drove-up cholesterol concentrations in ABCA7- and ABCA1-HDL to the limits. Thus, while the phospholipid specificity of ABCA1-mediated efflux is optimized to make HDL with the highest solubility for cholesterol, the phospholipid specificity of ABCA7-HDL is not optimized for this purpose. Nonetheless, ABCA7-HDL still had a high concentration of cholesterol simply because cholesterol can readily invade any available lipid bilayer and was available in excess. Therefore, cholesterol is a cargo lipid in ABCA1-HDL but a bulk lipid in ABCA7-HDL, which has a different cargo lipid.

We have recently proposed that ABCA7-mediated efflux removes a specific lipid from the cell that arises during normal function, causes neurodegeneration and promotes development of AD in neural tissues [45]. This proposal is based on the precedents provided by ABCA1 and ABCA4. ABCA1 mediates removal of cholesterol that macrophages engulf with low-density lipoprotein and dying cells [11]. Individuals with heritable mutations in ABCA1 (Tangier disease) accumulate cholesteryl esters in macrophages and cells of other type [46]. Likewise, ABCA4 mediates disposal of N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine, which arises in photoreceptor cells during light perception; heritable loss of ABCA4 leads to accumulation of all-trans and 11-cis retinoids in photoreceptors and causes a range of degenerative eye diseases [47]. Global changes that occur in lipid metabolism in Abca7-deleted mice and individuals with certain ABCA7 variants are likely to be secondary outcomes of the loss of ABCA7 primary function [18–20]. The cargo of ABCA7-lipoprotein remains to be identified.

The present study suggests the following further conclusions regarding ABCA7 and ABCA1 functional properties. ABCA7 and ABCA1 localize preferentially to the plasma membrane in most, if not all, cell types [present work and ref. 12,14,48,49] and support lipid efflux to a variety of lipid acceptors, including the synthetic 18A peptide, apo A-I, apo A-II, apo E, serum amyloid A, HDL, plasma and CSF [present work and ref. 12–16,50]. However, while ABCA1 distinguishes between the apo E ε3 and ε4 isoforms in that ABCA1-mediated efflux of cholesterol and choline-phospholipid to apo E ε3 is higher than to ε4, ABCA7 does not differentiate between the two, and ABCA7-mediated choline-phospholipid efflux to apo E ε3 and ε4 is the same. This has been previously shown [12], and this finding is confirmed here.

In summary, the present work shows that ABCA7-mediated efflux lacks the high specificity for phosphatidylcholine that is evident in ABCA1-mediated efflux and releases significantly less, although not dramatically less, of cholesterol in comparison with cholesterol efflux brought about by ABCA1. We suggest that the discrepancies that exist in the literature with regard to the ability of ABCA7 to mediate cell cholesterol efflux have arisen because small-scale cholesterol efflux assays using cells weakly expressing ABCA7 underestimate ABCA7-mediate cholesterol efflux owing to cholesterol diffusion away from HDL. We further suggest to divide lipid components of ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL into the bulk lipids that comprise the lipid bilayer of HDL and the cargo lipids that are solubilized in the bilayer for the purpose of being transported. The cargo lipid in ABCA1-HDL is cholesterol, the cargo lipid in ABCA7-HDL is presently unknown.

Fig. 1. Expression of human ABCA7 in BHK cells. Several BHK cell lines that express human ABCA7 after treatment with mifepristone (mife) were made (A). The line with the lowest level of expression (marked as low) and a line with some of the highest (marked as high) level of expression were further investigated. ABCA7 was localized predominantly to the plasma membrane in both cell lines (B). This was determined by surface biotinylation. Human ABCA1 in BHK-ABCA1 cells was similarly predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (C). Inactivation of ABCA7 by deleting catalytically essential lysines residues in the Walker motifs did not affect localization of this protein to the plasma membrane (D).

Fig. 2. ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated choline-phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to apo A-I, apo E and plasma. Cellular pools of choline-phospholipid (i.e., phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) and cholesterol were labeled with, correspondingly, [3H]choline and [14C]cholesterol, the cells were treated with mifepristone and exposed to the indicated lipid acceptors. BHK-ABCA7(low) cells exhibited significant choline-phospholipid efflux to apo A-I and apo E (A, left panel) but no significant cholesterol efflux to any of the acceptors; BHK-ABCA7(high) cells had significant choline-phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to all acceptors (A, right panel). BHK-ABCA1 cells exhibited strong and significant choline-phospholipid and cholesterol efflux to apo A-I and apo E (B). To evaluate the strength of cholesterol efflux relative to choline-phospholipid efflux in BHK-ABCA7(high) and BHK-ABCA1 cells, the percentage of cholesterol efflux was divided by the percentage of choline-phospholipid efflux for the same acceptor. This ratio was significantly higher for ABCA1-mediated efflux in comparison with ABCA7-mediated efflux, indicating that ABCA1 removed more cholesterol per the same amount of choline-phospholipid than ABCA7 (C).

Fig. 4. ABCA7-mediated lipid efflux to HDL, 18A and apo E ε3 and ε4, and the requirement for intact catalytic capacity in ABCA7. ABCA7-mediated choline-phospholipid efflux to HDL was significant in BHK-ABCA7(low) and BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (A). Efflux of choline-phospholipid to 18A was also significant in both cell lines, but ABCA7-mediated cholesterol efflux to 18A could be detected only in ABCA7(high) cells, where it was also significant (B). Some CSF supported choline-phospholipid efflux from mifepristone-treated BHK-ABCA7(low) and BHK-ABCA7(high) cells (C). An isoform of ABCA7 that has mutated essential lysine residues in the Walker motifs of the nucleotide-binding domains does not mediate choline-phospholipid efflux (D). The magnitudes of choline-phospholipid efflux from ABCA7(high) cells to apo E ε3 and ε4 were not significantly different (E).

Fig. 5. ABCA7- and ABCA1-mediated efflux of broad classes of sphingolipids and glycerolipids to apo A-I and plasma. Sphingosine-lipid, including sphingomyelin, were labeled using radioactive D-erythro-dihydrosphingosine. Mifepristone-treated BHK-ABCA7(high) and BHK-ABCA1 cells supported significant efflux of sphingosine-lipid to apo A-I and the plasma (A). Radioactive serine was used to label BHK cell phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine [35]. BHK-ABCA7(high) cells supported significant serine-lipid efflux to apo A-I; ABCA1-mediated serine-lipid efflux was significant to apo A-I and plasma (B). Radioactive myo-inositol was used to label phosphatidylinositol. All cell lines exhibited significant phosphatidylinositol efflux to apo A-I and plasma (C). The sphingosine-lipid, serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol efflux percentages to apo A-I were divided by the choline-phospholipid efflux percentages to apo A-I from Fig. 2A and B to calculate the sphingosine-lipid, serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol to choline-phospholipid efflux ratios. The serine-lipid/choline-phospholipid and phosphatidylinositol/choline-phospholipid efflux ratios were significantly higher for ABCA7- than for ABCA1-mediated efflux (D).

Fig. 6. Lipid composition of ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL as determined by shotgun lipidomics. Large scale preparations of ABCA7-HDL and ABCA1-HDL were analyzed by multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics. ABCA7-HDL had significantly less phosphatidylcholine (PC, panel A) and significantly more phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidic acid (PA) than ABCA1-HDL (B). Although there was significantly less cholesterol (CL) in ABCA7-HDL than ABCA1-HDL, this difference was not large (C). ABCA7-HDL also had less lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and the same amounts of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), triacylglycerol (TG) and cholesteryl ester (CE) (D,E). ns - not significant, * - p &lt; 0.05, ** - p &lt; 0.01, *** - p &lt; 0.001.
