Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, are devastating diseases in the elderly world, which are closely associated with progressive neuronal loss induced by a variety of genetic and/or environmental factors. Unfortunately, currently available treatments for neurodegenerative disorders can only relieve the symptoms but not modify the pathological processes. Over the past decades, our group by collaborating with Profs. Yuan-Ping Pang and Paul R. Carlier has developed three series of homo/hetero dimeric acetylcholinesterase inhibitors derived from tacrine and/or huperzine A. The representative dimers bis(3)-Cognitin (B3C), bis(12)-hupyridone, and tacrine(10)-hupyridone might possess disease-modifying effects through the modulation of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, the activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2D gene transcription, and the promotion of neurotrophic factor secretion. In this review, we summarize that the representative dimers, such as B3C, provide neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins via multiple targets, including the inhibitions of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor with pathological-activated potential, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, and β-amyloid cascades synergistically. More importantly, B3C might offer disease-modifying potentials by activating myocyte enhancer factor 2D transcription, inducing neuritogenesis, and promoting the expressions of neurotrophic factors in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the novel dimers might offer synergistic disease-modifying effects, proving that dimerization might serve as one of the strategies to develop new generation of therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders.

pmc1 | INTRODUCTION

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are the groups of disorders characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal functions in the nervous system. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the two most common forms of NDDs among the aging populations (Alzheimer’s Association, 2016). The major symptoms of AD are cognitive impairments, including loss of decision-making ability and judgment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 65.7 million people will suffer from AD, and the estimated medical cost will be around US$600 billion in 2030 (Jia et al., 2018). It is no doubt that NDDs are not only substantial health and economic burden on society but also severely affecting the quality of life of patients.

The causes of NDDs might be closely associated with neuronal apoptosis. Significant neuronal loss, induced by a variety of risks, might greatly contribute to the pathological progress of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and PD (Grossberg et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Hyper-phosphorylation of tau protein, accumulation of β amyloid (Aβ), neuronal loss, and oxidative stress have been characterized as the main biological hallmarks with the pathology of AD. Both extracellular amyloid plaques accumulation and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles have been proposed as the most important pathological features for AD diagnosis (Forstl &amp; Kurz, 1999; van Marum, 2008). In addition, the abnormal regulations of cellular or molecular pathways, especially in hippocampus and cortex, might play an important role in the AD pathogenesis. These lesions may eventually lead to dementia. However, the exact causes or the underlying mechanisms need to be further elucidated. In the past decades, several hypotheses, including the cholinergic hypothesis, excitotoxicity hypothesis, and Aβ cascades hypothesis, have been developed (Abeysinghe et al., 2020; Barbero-Camps et al., 2013; Mullard, 2016; Salminen et al., 2008). The currently available drugs for treating AD are limited. So far, only five drugs, targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, respectively, have been approved by USFDA to treat AD. There are four AChE inhibitors (AChEIs), tacrine (Cognex®−1993), donepezil (Aricept®−1996), rivastigmine (Exelon®−2000), and galantamine (Reminyl®−2001), which have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy on AD patients by enhancing the cholinergic transmission (Coyle et al., 1983; Folch et al., 2016), while memantine (Namenda®−2000) is a well-tolerated NMDA receptor antagonist and was approved to treat moderate to severe AD by USFDA in 2003 (Parsons et al., 1999; Reisberg et al., 2003). In addition, Huperzine A, an alkaloid derived from the herbal medicine Huperzia Serrata (also known as Qian Ceng Ta), has been approved for treating AD in China, also exhibited potent inhibitory effects on AChE and provided neuroprotective effects (Francis et al., 1999; McGleenon et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1986; Zhang &amp; Tang, 2006).

Regarding the therapeutic outcomes, the single-target drugs cannot cure or slow down the pathological process of AD. Studies have shown that combinations of AChE inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists might provide synergistic therapeutic benefits to the AD patients. In 2014, USFDA has approved a fixed combination of memantine and donepezil in a capsule (Namzaric®, 2014) for the treatment of moderate to severe AD (Greig, 2015). The results from a meta-analysis by the European Academy of Neurology revealed that Namzaric, concurrently hitting AChE and NMDA receptors, could synergistically improve the behaviors and mood, cognitive functions, and global outcomes when compared to those of AChE inhibitors monotherapy used in treating mild to severe AD patients (Schmidt et al., 2015). The success of donepezil and memantine combination has opened a new door for the treatment of multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders through multiple targets.

Disease-modifying therapies have been proposed as an effective strategy for curing NDDs, by arresting or slowing the pathological processes (Golde, 2006). Neuroprotection and/or neuro-restoration might be essential for modifying the disease progress through multiple targets. Compared to the multiple component or cocktail drugs, single compound with multitarget or multifunction might reduce the risk of drug-drug interactions (Morphy &amp; Rankovic, 2005). Thus, multitarget drugs have been developed in the last decade due to their advantages in the treatment of complex diseases such as cancer and NDDs (Blaikie et al., 2019; Youdim, 2013). In the past decades, many studies have proven that multifunctional compounds could provide synergistic effects on neuroprotection through pharmacophores and functional chemical moieties, making it possess desired multiple functions (Bajda et al., 2011; Blaikie et al., 2019; Jeong, 2017). Thus, novel dimers/hybrids have been synthesized from the pharmacophores or existing anti-AD drugs. For example, Rosini et al., (2005) have synthesized a hybrid from tacrine and lipoic acid, showing multiple anti-AD effects including the inhibitions of AChE and Aβ aggregation. In addition, Camps et al., (2000) designed and synthesized series of tacrine-huperzine A hybrids (Huperines) by linking tacrine and huperzine A. The hybrids have demonstrated more potent inhibitory effects on AChE than those of the analogues with ability to penetrate blood-brain barrier (BBB). Roldan-Pena et al., (2019) have also reported a series of tacrine-phenolic heterodimers possessed multiple functions such as neuroprotection and inhibition of AChE and Aβ self-aggregation. Moreover, a series of tacrine-coumarin hybrids have been designed and synthesized to inhibit AChE, which have been shown to reduce Aβ aggregation and to chelate metal ions (Bajda et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011). Another example is the donepezil and curcumin hybrids, which were shown significant AChE inhibition, anti-oxidant, and metal-chelating activities (Unzeta et al., 2016). Ladostigil, a dual AChE and MAO inhibitor, has been developed by Prof. Moussa et al. for the treatment of dementia and depression (Weinreb et al., 2012; Youdim, 2013). Piazzi et al., (2008) have designed and synthesized compound 22, a dual inhibitor of AChE and BACE-1 have also synthesized lipocrine, an antioxidant with AChE and Aβ aggregation inhibition activities. The multifunctional molecules might provide more advantages comparing to the combinations, such as more appropriate pharmacokinetic profile and easier for admission by dementia patients (Umar &amp; Hoda, 2017).

The concept that dimerizes the pharmacophores or functional moieties from existing drugs by a linker is one of the effective ways to obtain multitarget directed ligands (MTDLs) (Carlier et al., 1999; Eckroat et al., 2020; Han et al., 1999; Sameem et al., 2017). Slightly different from the hybrids, several series of homodimers or heterodimers have designed and synthesized derived from tacrine and/or the fragment of huerzine A linked by alkylene chain (Figure 1). Compared to the monomers, some of these dimers have demonstrated more superior inhibitory effect on AChE through binding to catalytic and peripheral anionic sites (Carlier et al., 2000; Pang et al., 1996). For example, compared with tacrine, bis(7)-Cognitin (B7C) proved 1,000 times more potent and 10,000 times more selective in inhibiting rat brain AChE (Li et al., 2009; Pang et al., 1996). Furthermore, the tacrine-based dimers inhibited γ-aminobutyric acid subtype A (GABAA) receptors in a tether-dependent manner (Li, Carlier, et al., 2007). B7C has also exhibited multifunctional anti-AD effects by inhibiting AChE, NMDA receptors, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and Aβ cascades, concurrently (Fu et al., 2008, 2009; Li et al., 2006; Li, Xue, et al., 2007). Furthermore, huperzine A has been showed to potently inhibiting AChE, Aβ and NMDA receptor (Gordon et al., 2001; Tang et al., 1989). However, the clinical developments of huperzine A were limited by the difficulties to chemically synthesized or isolated from the herb. Bis(12)-hupyridone (B12H), another promising dimer derived from huperzine A, has demonstrated multifunctional neuroprotection and neurodifferentiation in the in vitro and in vivo models associated with AD (Cui, Cui, et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2013; Cui, Li, et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011). In our previous investigations, the log P values for B12H and B7C were determined to be 5.4 and 8.2, respectively, indicating that the two dimers are highly lipophilic. In addition, in vivo pharmacological assay conducted in mice have showed a maximum AChE inhibition occurred 15 min after the single-dose (i.p.) of either dimer. All these results have indicated that bis(3)-Cognitin (B3C) and B12H may easily pass through the BBB in a relatively short period (Yu et al., 2008). In this review, we systematically reviewed our most recent findings of novel dimers, including B3C and tacrine(10)-hupyridone (A10E) (Table 1), which might provide disease-modifying effects by inhibition of amyloid cascade, induction of neurodifferentiation, and enhancement of the secretion of neurotrophic factors.

2 | B3C MIGHT BE A PATHOLOGICALLY ACTIVATED ANTAGONIST WITH FAST OFF-RATE ON NMDA RECEPTOR

Excitatory neurotransmission mediated by the NMDA receptor plays a fundamental role in both physiological and pathological processes in the mammalian central nervous system (Mehta et al., 2013). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NMDA receptors might be over-activated at low transmembrane potential, resulting in an excessive influx of Ca2+ and subsequently triggering apoptosis (Piña-Crespo et al., 2014). Thus, NMDA receptors have been proposed as one of the therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative disorders (Hardingham, 2009; Lipton, 2005). Based on the glutamate-induced neuronal excitotoxicity hypothesis, small molecules which might antagonize NMDA receptor has been proposed as the anti-dementia agent or combination with AChE inhibitors (Danysz &amp; Parsons, 2003; Geerts &amp; Grossberg, 2006). However, few of them succeeded to pass the clinical trials and become the anti-dementia drugs clinically. One of the major issues might be the serious adverse effects caused by the candidates (Olivares et al., 2012). It has been revealed that many important physiological functions are mediated by NMDA receptors (Benarroch, 2011). Antagonists with high affinity could reduce the Ca2+ influx by antagonizing the NMDA receptor; however, the physiological signal transductions might be also blocked. For example, MK-801 and phencyclidine are potent NMDA receptor antagonists with high affinity with NMDA receptors. Unfortunately, MK-801 has been associated with several side effects, such as cognitive disruption and psychotic-spectrum reactions; thus, it cannot be used to treat AD (Harder et al., 1998; Ramoa et al., 1990).

Uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists with moderate affinity and fast off-rate have been proposed to be effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (Lipton, 2007). The concept of pathologically activated therapeutics (PAT) proposed that the antagonists or ligands might only block the receptor in the pathological condition but not the physiological condition (Lipton, 2004, 2005, 2007). Memantine, the first and only NMDA receptor antagonist for treating AD, is an example of the PAT properties, meeting the criteria of drugs for various neurodegenerative disorders (Lipton, 2005, 2006). In the previous studies, we have demonstrated that some of the dimers, including B3C, B7C, and B12H, are GABAA receptor and NMDA receptor antagonists (Cui et al., 2013; Li et al., 2006; Li, Xue, et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2007). Based on the results of electrophysiology experiments, the dimers antagonized NMDA receptors in a tether-length dependent manner (Liu, Luo, et al., 2008). Among them, B7C is the most potent NMDA receptor antagonist with IC50 of 0.19 μM (Liu, Li, et al., 2008). In addition, B3C has moderate inhibitory effects on the NMDA receptor with IC50 of 0.52 μM (Luo et al., 2010).

More importantly, under pathological conditions mediated by glutamate, B3C, in contrast to B7C, prevent excitotoxicity with increasing efficacy against escalating levels of glutamate (25–500 μM) in rat primary cultured cerebellar granule neurons (Li et al., 2005; Luo et al., 2010). In primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons, B3C voltage-dependently, selectively and moderately inhibits NMDA-activated currents measured by patch-clamp. These findings suggest that B3C exhibited the PAT potential against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in vitro. The inhibitory effects of B3C are increased with the rise in NMDA and glycine concentrations. In addition, the kinetics studies show that B3C inhibited NMDA receptor with fast-off rates, and the off-rate time constant is 1.9 s (Luo et al., 2010). Moreover, the molecular docking simulations suggest that B3C might interact with NMDA receptors at the MK-801 binding region in the ion channel pore. This finding is further confirmed by ligand binding assay, indicating that B3C competes with [3H]MK-801 with a Ki value of 0.27 μM. And the point mutation of NR1(N616R) of NMDA receptors significantly reduces the inhibitory potency by B3C. More interestingly, MK-801 inhibits the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and impair the abilities of learning tasks in rats and primates (Gao &amp; Tamminga, 1995). Unlike MK-801, although B3C might bind to the NMDA receptor in the MK-801 site, B3C enhances LTP in hippocampal slices of rat, whereas memantine does not alter this process (Jiang et al., 2016). In our previous studies, B3C has been demonstrated as an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist with fast off-rate and moderate binding affinity. Studies have proof that MK-801 is a potent noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The findings of patch clamp experiment have demonstrated that B3C blocks NMDA receptor in a voltage-dependent manner. The differences between B3C and MK-801 might be due to the differences of binding affinity to NMDA receptor. These results suggest that B3C is an uncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors with moderate affinity and fast off rate, which may provide PAT for various neurodegenerative disorders associated with NMDA receptor dysfunction. Moreover, the enhancement of LTP may be attributed to the elevation of acetylcholine levels and the inhibition of GABAA receptors. As a multifunctional dimer, B3C may contribute to the facilitation of LTP not only antagonizes NMDA receptors but also through multiple pathways.

3 | B3C PROVIDES MULTIFUNCTIONAL NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS

Animal studies have shown that B3C attenuated cognitive impairment in the animal models associated with AD (Han et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2016; Luo et al., 2010). B3C could inhibit glutamate-induced apoptosis in a concentration-and time-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.45 μM, which is about 10 times more potent than that of memantine (4.58 μM) (Hu, Cui, Mak, et al., 2013). In general, the potency of neuroprotection against glutamate excitotoxicity produced by NMDA receptor antagonists might reflect the potency of inhibition on the NMDA receptor. The IC50 of B3C against NMDA-activated currents is 0.52 μM, which is 3 times more potent than that of memantine (IC50, 1.68 μM). The discrepancy between the potency of two NMDA receptor antagonists (B3C and memantine)-induced NMDA-activated current inhibition and neuroprotection against glutamate excitotoxicity may be explained by the different model systems or the treatments of chemicals.

These findings may indicate other possible contributing targets at membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, or nucleus for B3C. Our previous study has shown that B7C, another similar multifunctional neuroprotective dimer of tacrine, could elicit superior neuroprotection via concurrent blockade of NMDA receptor and neuronal NOS (nNOS) signaling (Li, Xue, et al., 2007; Luo et al., 2007). Like B7C, the results indicate that B3C might directly inhibit nNOS, contributing to its superior neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in cerebellar granule neurons (Hu, Cui, Mak, et al., 2013). Furthermore, glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is mediated by the excessive influx of calcium, mainly through overactivating NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, and subsequently initiating several downstream signaling pro-apoptotic pathways. It has been reported that the activation of nitric oxide (NO), MAPK pathways, and the inhibition of the GSK3β pathway, the downstream pathways of calcium overload, mediate the intracellular signaling transduction of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (Hu, Cui, Xu, et al., 2013). The results of pharmacological experiments strongly suggest that pretreatment of B3C and memantine might inhibit the increase of intracellular NO, suppress the activation of ERK, and reverse the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3β suppressed by glutamate insults concurrently. Taken together, the findings suggest that B3C elicited promising neuroprotection via concurrent regulation of NO, MAPK/ERK, and PI3-K/Akt/GSK3β pathways, which are downstream signaling pathways of NMDA receptors.

4 | B3C PROTECTS AGAINST AΒ-INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY BY INHIBITING THE FORMATIONS OF AΒ OLIGOMER AND FIBRILS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO

Many studies have pointed out that Aβ aggregation plays a crucial role in the pathological process of AD (Barbero-Camps et al., 2013; Salminen et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2018). Therefore, the regulation of expression and aggregation of Aβ has been proposed as an effective anti-AD strategy (Danysz &amp; Parsons, 2012; van Marum, 2008; Salminen et al., 2008). Aβ can be produced by an amyloidogenic pathway resulting from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), first by β-secretases, and subsequently by γ-secretases. On the other hand, APP can be cleaved by α-and γ-secretases in the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Many researchers have focused on the regulations of secretases, including β-and γ-secretases, to reduce the production of Aβ. Moreover, to promote the nonamyloidogenic APP pathway, several α-secretase enhancers or activators have been developed. Acitretin, a retinoid drug for treating dermatologic diseases, and epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol from green tea, are proposed to be α-secretase enhancers, promoting the nonamyloidogenic pathway (Ettcheto et al., 2020; Holthoewer et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). Monoclonal antibodies or small molecules targeting the production of Aβ have been developed or designed through different mechanisms (Lozupone et al., 2020; Plotkin &amp; Cashman, 2020).

The strategies of the inhibition of the proteolytic activities of β-and γ-secretases could reduce the synthesis of Aβ (Selkoe &amp; Hardy, 2016). In previous studies, some drug candidates, such as Lanabecestat and Verubecestat, targeting β-secretases have been demonstrated to reduce the amount of Aβ in AD patients (Egan et al., 2019; Panza et al., 2018; Wessels et al., 2019). However, most of these drugs have failed in large randomized clinical trials conducted for treating mild-to-moderate AD. For example, Lanabecestat, a novel potent β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 inhibitor, has been demonstrated to significantly reduce concentrations of Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid and brain (Sims et al., 2017). On June 12, 2018, AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly and Company announced that they were discontinuing the phase 3 clinical trial of Lanabecestat. It might be because that Lanabecestat was unlikely to improve the cognitive status in the patient group (Wessels et al., 2019).

In the past decade, many immunotherapies against Aβ have been developed for the treatment of AD. Vaccination with the soluble or fibrillar form of Aβ peptides and passive immunotherapies with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against Aβ are effective in reducing Aβ in transgenic APP mice (Lardenoije et al., 2019; Syvanen et al., 2018). The passively administrated monoclonal antibodies against Aβ, such as Bapineuzumab and Crenezumab, might trigger the clearance or inhibit the production of Aβ by binding to the β-secretase cleavage site on APP (Abushouk et al., 2017). Although many anti-Aβ antibodies have shown promising effects to reduce the amount of Aβ and senile plaques in cerebrospinal fluid or brain, most of these drugs have been terminated in Phase III trials due to the lack of effects to improve cognitive functions in AD patients (Hung &amp; Fu, 2017; Kwon et al., 2020; Rygiel, 2016).

Alternatively, the inhibition of fibrilization and generation of Aβ oligomer might be effective strategies for AD treatment (Darling &amp; Shorter, 2020; Rahimi et al., 2008; Yoshiike et al., 2003). Aβ aggregation is a complex process of assembly. Aβ monomers undergo multiple steps of conformational transition and reorganization, forming the oligomeric intermediate and finally becoming fibrils with β-sheet structures (Davis &amp; Berkowitz, 2010). The fibrils and soluble Aβ oligomer have been proposed as the major toxic species during the Aβ assembly, which might induce synaptic lost and neuronal cell death. Based on this hypothesis, a variety of inhibitors, including small molecules and antibodies, targeting Aβ aggregation have been designed and developed. More notably, many small molecules, owning the ability to inhibit Aβ aggregation, shared the symmetrical structures, including curcumin, resveratrol, and orcein-related O4 (Sun et al., 2015; Yanagisawa et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2005). Furthermore, B7C could protect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting BACE-1 and reducing the formation of Aβ oligomers (Chang et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2008, 2009). Therefore, we speculated that B3C, B7C, and B12H, with symmetrical structures, might also inhibit Aβ aggregation.

Encouragingly, B3C has shown promising effects on the neuroprotective effects in a variety of animal models associated with NDDs, including Aβ-induced cognitive failure in rodents (Han et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2020). The in vivo findings of B3Cs effects against Aβ-induced apoptosis and cognitive failures, strongly suggest that B3C could prevent the formation of Aβ fibrils (Hu et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2016). The speculation is further confirmed by Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and atomic force microscopy, demonstrating that coincubation of B3C and Aβ monomers sharply reduce the fibrils distributed sporadically. Interestingly, B3C also greatly disaggregates preformed Aβ fibrils (Hu et al., 2020). These findings indicated that B3C could either bind with Aβ monomers to prevent the formation of structured Aβ oligomers or slowdown the conformational transition into Aβ fibrils. Moreover, B3C might induce the transformation of mature Aβ fibrils into granular aggregates, leading to Aβ fibrils disaggregation (Hu et al., 2020). Electrophysiological studies have shown that Aβ oligomers exhibit a strong inhibitory effect on the induction of hippocampal LTP (Jiang et al., 2016). B3C at 0.5 μM effectively reverses Aβ-induced LTP inhibition, which is much lower than that of tacrine or donepezil, but not interfere with the normal LTP in rat hippocampal slices. This finding is further confirmed by the evaluation of the synaptic plasticity induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The HFS-induced LTP is potently inhibited by preperfusion of Aβ applied 40 min before HFS. In addition, the EPSP amplitudes at 1 hr after HFS are significantly lower than those of the group without Aβ. Preincubation of B3C at 0.5 μM for 1 hr prior to HFS significantly attenuates the Aβ-oligomer-induced inhibition of LTP in a concentration-dependent manner (Jiang et al., 2016). Moreover, the EPSP amplitudes reduced by Aβ oligomers at 1 hr after HFS are significantly reversed by B3C.

More encouragingly, B3C has also shown superior anti-AD effects in animal models. Aβ might induce spatial working memory and recognition deficits in rodents, mimicking in the cognitive function impairments in the early stage of AD. The results of the Morris water maze and novel object recognition task indicate that B3C might prevent the cognitive impairments and spatial memory deficits induced by Aβ oligomer or fibrils in vivo, respectively (Han et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2016). How does B3C inhibit the Aβ oligomers and fibrils-induced neurotoxicity? The symmetrical fragments of B3C may interact with Aβ at both ends, either to block the process of fibrillization or disaggregate the mature fibrils. Structurally, B3C, as well as the other homodimers, may have the advantage to interrupt the progress of Aβ aggregation by the interaction with its monomer. Some studies suggest that Aβ aggregation might be driven mainly by hydrophobic forces including aromatic packing (Marshall et al., 2011). B3C consists of a large hydrophobic area and a small polar part, suggesting that B3C might directly bind with Aβ via hydrophobic interactions. These interactions may interfere with the intermolecular interactions of Aβ and ultimately lead to the formation of unstructured aggregates.

5 | B3C REGULATES MYOCYTE ENHANCER FACTOR 2 (MEF2) GENE TRANSCRIPTION

MEF2 consists of 4 different isoforms (MEF2A-D) and governs development, differentiation, and even survival of various cells including neurons (Li et al., 2001; Lin et al., 1996). Studies have shown that the survival-and death-related pathways such as glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and GSK3β converge their regulatory activities on the expression and translocation of MEF2 (Butts et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2018; She et al., 2012). It has been reported that the expression of MEF2C in AD patients was significantly lower than those in healthy elderly (Sao et al., 2018). In addition, evidence also suggests that MEF2C may facilitate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (Adachi et al., 2016). The activation of MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) in particular, has been well demonstrated to be critical for neuroprotection in response to various neurotoxins. For example, we have previously reported that the enhancement of MEF2D transcriptional activity by rhynchophylline and SU4312 could attenuate motor function deficits in rodent animal models associated with NDDs (Guo et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2018). Taken together, MEF2D could serve as an important target for the neuroprotectants.

The dimers, such as B3C, possess MEF2D stimulatory effects in various cellular and animal models associated with NDDs, and thus considered to provide possible therapeutic values. MEF2D is regulated by chaperone-mediated autophagy, which might be disrupted by α-synuclein-induced toxicity during PD progress (Yang &amp; Mao, 2010). In addition, α-synuclein aggregation can reduce the expression of MEF2D in substantia nigra. The alterations of MEF2D have been proven to parallel with the changes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressions. These findings demonstrate that the dysregulation of MEF2D may play a critical role in PD, suggesting that MEF2D may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of PD. Constituted with previous findings, B3C, but not tacrine or B7C, might enhance the activity of MEF2D in dopaminergic neurons with the basal condition (Yao et al., 2012). In addition, B3C provides significant neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons against MPP+-induced injury and SN4741 cells from α-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that B3C might also restore the activity of MEF2D under the neurotoxins challenge. We have observed that both wild type and A53T mutant α-synuclein dysregulated the function of MEF2D in vitro. Although further experiments will be needed, B3C might protect against α-synuclein-induced toxicity by reversing the dysfunctions of MEF2D. More importantly, B3C ameliorates dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra and improves the behavioral impairments in mice by restoring the dysfunctions of MEF2D in MPTP-induced PD mice model (Yao et al., 2012). Taken together, the dimer, B3C specifically, might provide substantial neuroprotection against a variety of neurotoxins by regulating MEF2D in the models associated with AD and PD in vitro and in vivo.

6 | B3C AND B7C INDUCE NEURITOGENESIS THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF Α7 NICOTINIC ACH RECEPTOR

Neuroprotection combining with neuritogenesis has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to slow down the pathological progress of NDDs. Studies have shown that degeneration of neurites is prior to the determination of neurons, leading to the communication failure between neurons (Skaper, 2005). Neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), play essential roles on the promotion of neuritogenesis. However, the therapeutic application of exogenous NGF is severely restricted by their poor penetration through the BBB and the undesirable apoptotic effects by interacting with the p75NTR receptor (Bamji et al., 1998). Thus, small molecules that mimic the neurotrophic action to promote neuritogenesis might provide disease-modifying effects for treating NDDs. Recent studies strongly suggested that activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR) is important for mediating various cellular responses including neuritogenesis (Nordman &amp; Kabbani, 2012; Utsugisawa et al., 2002). The activation of α7-nAChR might induce calcium influx, which stimulates the downstream signaling pathways, including the MAPK pathway. As the dimers have demonstrated superior inhibitory effects on AChE, the degradation of acetylcholine could be inhibited and then α7-nAChR could be activated indirectly. As expected, several dimers, including B3C, B7C and B12H, have shown to be able to promote neuritogenesis in PC12 cells and primary cultured neurons (Cui, Cui, et al., 2011; Hu, Cui, Mak, Choi, et al., 2015; Hu, Cui, Mak, Xu, et al., 2015). Either pharmacological blockade or genetic depletion of α7-nAChR partially abolished the neurite outgrowth, as well as ERK activation, induced by B3C and B7C (Hu, Cui, Mak, Choi, et al., 2015; Hu, Cui, Mak, Xu, et al., 2015). These findings indicated that the dimers might induce neurite outgrowth by promoting the activation of α7-nAChR. In addition, studies have indicated that activation of α7-nAChR might play a crucial role to suppress the neuroinflammation, which has been closely related to the pathological development of NDDs (Kawamata &amp; Shimohama, 2011; Lykhmus et al., 2016). Thus, the dimers enhance the activation of α7-nAChR and then not only induce neuritogenesis but also potentially suppress neuroinflammation, providing novel insights into the potential application of α7-nAChR activators against NDDs.

7 | B3C AND A10E PROMOTE THE SECRETION OF NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS IN VIVO

Neurotrophic factors, such as NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial-derived neurotrophic factor, play important roles for neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity (Budni et al., 2015). Studies have revealed that the level of BNDF in the brain of patients with NDDs is significantly lower than those of healthy people (Mitra et al., 2019). In addition, NGF and BDNF have demonstrated anti-AD effects in the animal models by enhancing the synapse formation and neuroprotection. However, the exogenous application of NGF may not be effective to improve the cognitive impairments, as it may be not easy to pass through the BBB (Poduslo &amp; Curran, 1996). Thus, small molecules owning the ability to enhance the expression of neurotrophic factors might not only relieve the symptoms but also effectively modify the pathological development of NDDs. Recent studies have shown that A10E might improve the motor functions by elevating BDNF in post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) models (Chen, Wu, et al., 2018; Ke et al., 2019).

POCD could cause short-term or long-term cognitive disruption due to the neurodegeneration after anesthesia and surgery in the elderly. Previous studies indicated that the enhancement of BDNF expression and the cholinergic system might be effective to treat POCD (Hem et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017). The results of behavioral tests, including novel object recognition test and Morris water maze, reveal that A10E, a dimer derived from tacrine and huperzine A, could prevent surgery-induced cognitive impairments in aged mice. Moreover, A10E significantly increases the expression of BDNF, stimulating the downstream Akt and ERK pathways. A10E could enhance the cholinergic signal transmission by substantially elevating the choline acetyltransferase activities and inhibiting AChE in the hippocampus (Chen, Wu, et al., 2018). In conclusion, the novel dimers, including B3C and A10E, not only provide neuroprotective effects but also enhance the expressions of neurotrophic factors. These findings might strongly support that the novel dimers might be promisingly developed as disease-modifying drugs for the treatment of NDDs.

7.1 | Summary and prospects

NDDs, especially AD and PD, are caused by multifactorial pathological mechanisms. Thus, the traditional “one-drug-one-target” therapeutic strategy has been challenged from most aspects. For example, there is no novel drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of AD over the last two decades. The novel strategy has been tweeted to the “one-drug-multi-target” concept that the drug should be able to regulate the dysfunction of multiple therapeutic targets concurrently. Many studies have demonstrated that multifunctional small molecules will provide greater efficacy and/or better therapeutic benefits based on synergistic regulations with multiple targets. Design and synthesis of the MTDLs might be effective to obtain the multifunctional candidates for the treatment of NDDs.

Over the past decades, many investigators have systematically investigated the multifunctional small molecules for developing the potential anti-NDDs drugs. Several series of novel dimeric AChE inhibitors derived from tacrine and/or the fragment of huperzine A have been demonstrated to provide multifunctional neuroprotection and disease-modifying effects. Among them, B3C, B7C, B12H and A10E, are the superior representatives showing multifunctional effects in a variety of models in vitro and in vivo. In particular, B3C, similar to memantine, exhibits pathologically activated neuroprotection through uncompetitive blockade of NMDA receptor with fast off-rate, significant restores MEF2D dysfunctions and enhances the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the brain. Therefore, we conjecture that the novel dimers, such as B3C, may modify the pathogenesis and protect against neurotoxins. Moreover, mounting evidence indicated that natural products are the big resource for the development of drugs. In our previous studies, B12H, a dimer merged by tacrine and natural alkaloid, huperzine A, performs promising MTDLs characters, suggesting dimerization of homo/hetero monomers of small molecules or natural products should be an effective strategy to mining MTLDs for NDDs.

In the preclinical PK studies, the log P values for B7C and B12H have indicated that the two dimers are highly lipophilic. In addition, in vivo pharmacological assay conducted in mice have showed a maximum AChE inhibition occurred 15 min after the single-dose (i.p.) of either dimer. All these results have indicated that B7C and B12H may easily pass through the BBB. However, B7C was expected to have a low oral bioavailability in vivo, which may be due to its poor intestinal permeability, significant tissue binding and hepatic hydroxylation metabolism. For the other promising dimers, the details of PK properties have remained unclear and more detail pre-clinical studies will be worth to conduct and the characteristics of dimers will be reported in future.

Taken together, these representative dimeric AChE inhibitors may provide robust therapeutic effects to NDDs, including AD and PD. Furthermore, these findings have demonstrated that dimerization is an effective strategy to rationally design the novel drugs with multiple targets, which also offer new insights into the molecular basis of NDD modifications.
