Background

Current practice guidelines recommend against APOE testing. However, advances in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research may soon change this.

Objective

To examine longitudinally the experience of learning an APOE result and, if an ε4 carrier, taking a disease-specific treatment to reduce one’s risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

Methods

Fifty ε4 carriers and 20 non-carriers completed semi-structured interviews 3-months and 15-months after APOE disclosure.

Results

Individuals generally understand their APOE results. While non-carriers felt relief, ε4 carriers often described themselves as disappointed by their result but nevertheless glad to know. Carriers expressed concerns about stigma and discrimination, including in the workplace. Carriers adopted new health behaviors at higher rates than non-carriers and revised their future plans to account for their increased risk of AD. Individuals participating in research were hopeful that their participation would help them or others; individuals who learned they were at increased risk for AD but who could not participate in research were disappointed.

Conclusion

Providers disclosing APOE results should be sensitive to how APOE results shape emotions, self-perceptions, and attitudes about memory; raise concerns about stigma and discrimination in personal and professional relationships; influence health behaviors and decision-making; and can have follow-on effects on family members.

pmcApolipoprotein E (APOE) is a susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Whereas APOE ε2 and ε3 alleles are protective or neutral, respectively, APOE ε4 alleles increase the carrier’s risk of developing AD.[1] For the 10 to 15% of the population who are ε4 heterozygotes, lifetime risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia caused by AD is 20 to 25% percent; for the 1 to 2% of the population who are APOE ε4 homozygotes, lifetime risk may exceed 50%.[2]

In the clinical setting, genetic testing is typically done to inform at least one of the following: clarify a person’s risk, improve the accuracy of diagnosis or prognosis, or inform treatment. There has been little clinical benefit to APOE testing along these dimensions. Therefore, the American College of Medical Genetics and the National Society of Genetic Counselors issued joint practice guidelines recommending against APOE testing in 2011, which were reaffirmed in June 2018.[3,4] Further, insurers generally do not cover APOE testing.[5] Yet, advances in AD research and care may soon change this.

APOE testing and disclosure have become common in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for AD.[6,7] The results are used to enrich samples—that is, to enroll persons likely to experience cognitive decline over the course of the trial and therefore to show a response to therapy.[8] Additionally, ε4-carrier status increases the risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with edema or hemorrhages caused by certain amyloid-modifying therapies like Aduhelm (aducanumab), which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway.[9–11] Thus, the results of APOE testing offer key insights into both the potential benefits and also the potential risks of therapies and will constitute an important piece of information for patient and clinician decision making moving forward.

Here, we report results from the Study of Knowledge and Reactions to APOE Testing (SOKRATES II), a qualitative study of cognitively unimpaired older adults who learned their APOE genotype in order to enroll in a clinical trial. The current study builds upon prior work by investigating questions with implications germane to clinical practice. The API Generation Program’s process of APOE testing, counselling, and disclosure of test results, and if indicated, provision of a potential disease-modifying therapy for AD (albeit experimental) foretells clinical practice. SOKRATES II participants’ experiences provide insights into a future of diagnosis and treatment of a serious and disabling disease that involves millions of adults.

METHODS

Eligibility criteria

SOKRATES II participants were individuals screening for the API Generation Program, which consisted of Generation Study 1 (NCT02565511) and Generation Study 2 (NCT03131453)—secondary prevention trials testing the safety and efficacy of two investigational drugs, CAD106 and CNP520, respectively.[8] Generation Study 1 required that participants were cognitively unimpaired ε4 homozygotes, aged 60 to 75 at baseline. Generation Study 2’s inclusion criteria were similar except that participants needed only to be ε4 carriers, though elevated amyloid-β was also required for ε4 heterozygotes. API Generation Program participants underwent pre-test education about APOE—including possible results and implications for risk of developing MCI or dementia due to AD by age 85.[12] Genetic counselors disclosed the APOE results in-person, by phone, or by video conference using standardized talking points. While individuals who learned their APOE results via other means (e.g., direct-to-consumer genetic testing such as 23andMe) were eligible for the API Generation Program, only those who first learned their result through the API Generation Program were eligible for SOKRATES II.

Recruitment and enrollment

API Generation Program study staff at select sites provided materials describing SOKRATES II to individuals following APOE disclosure. Individuals interested in enrolling in SOKRATES II contacted the University of Pennsylvania research team. Data are not available on the number of individuals who received recruitment materials. Our pre-specified enrollment goal was 70 participants. In all, 163 individuals contacted the research team. Of those who did not ultimately participate, eight were ineligible, nine declined after learning more, and 76 were not interviewed due to demographic quotas being full or the study having closed to enrollment.

Data collection

Interviews were conducted telephonically between June 20, 2017 and August 23, 2019. Time 1 interviews, conducted approximately 3 months after APOE disclosure, examined four domains: (1) comprehension of and reactions to the APOE result; (2) implications for sense of self, memory, and future; (3) sharing of results with others; and (4) risk-reduction behaviors. Time 2 interviews, conducted approximately 15 months post disclosure, re-examined participants’ initial reports and included additional questions about employment and blood relatives’ uptake of genetic testing. The semi-structured interview guides, consisting of open-ended questions and probes, were developed by a multi-disciplinary team following a review of the literature. Interviews took approximately 45 minutes to complete.

Data analysis

Audio recordings of the interviews were professionally transcribed. NVivo qualitative analysis software (QSR International) was used to manage coding. Three authors reviewed a subset of the transcripts to identify themes, which were formalized in a codebook. Some codes were descriptive and grounded in the data, while others were more interpretive, based on useful concepts from the literature. A subset of transcripts was double coded by team members—with regular checks on agreement using the Cohen coefficient for inter-coder reliability —until inter-coder reliability was achieved (κ ≥ 0.80).[13] Differences were rectified through discussion, and the codebook was revised to account for themes not adequately captured and to adjust codes lacking clarity. Once the codebook had been refined and there was agreement on its application, all transcripts were coded. We reached code saturation.[14] The authors examined contrasts between the three groups (i.e., APOE ε4 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and non-carriers) as well as between the Time 1 and Time 2.

Human subjects protections

The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board approved SOKRATES II. Participants gave verbal consent.

RESULTS

Fifty ε4 carriers (i.e., 19 homo- and 31 heterozygotes) and 20 non-carriers completed an initial semi-structured interview 3-months after APOE disclosure; 17 homozygotes, 30 heterozygotes, and 16 non-carriers completed the 12-month follow-up. Demographics are reported in Table 1. Participants in this interview study are reflective of participants in the API Generation Program, who identify predominantly as female and non-Hispanic White.[15,16]

Baseline expectations

Only 4 of the 70 SOKRATES II participants expected to be non-carriers. Most participants (48 of 70 (69%)) indicated that, prior to testing, they expected to carry at least one ε4 allele. This expectation was most prevalent among homozygotes, as all but two believed they would be carriers (17 of 19 (89%)); however, two-thirds of heterozygotes (21 of 31 (68%)) and half of non-carriers (10 of 20 (50%)) also expected to be carriers. Many participants cited family history of AD, or lack thereof, to explain their baseline expectations. The few who expected to be non-carriers also cited their self-assessed cognitive abilities. For instance, a participant who expected to be a non-carrier but learned she was a heterozygote related how “[p]eople always talk about what a great memory I have…so that’s probably where the surprise came in.” A quarter of all SOKRATES II participants (18 of 70 (26%)) indicated they were uncertain what to expect or had no expectations at baseline.

Understanding of result

Most carriers understood they were at an increased risk for developing AD (46 of 50 (92%)). They invoked various reference points to assess their risk as “increased.” Some used other genotypes. For instance, one homozygote explained, “I’m at a much higher risk than people without two ε4s for developing Alzheimer’s.” Others drew comparisons to “the average person” or “the general population.” Still other participants did not specify any particular comparator but used language such as “slightly elevated,” “slightly higher,” or “high risk.” Three heterozygotes expressed a belief that they were at decreased risk for AD in comparison to homozygotes (3 of 31 (10%)). Although all participants had undergone genetic counselling that included presentation of numerical ranges of risk, few cited these numbers to explain the meaning of their genetic testing results.

Among non-carriers, equal proportions thought that they were at decreased (8 of 20 (40%)) or average (8 of 20 (40%)) risk for AD. Like carriers, non-carriers used different reference points to explain their risk, including ε4 homozygotes, ε4 carriers generally, and the “average” person. Four non-carriers described their risk as increased, having misunderstood their results and thinking that ε3 confers increased risk for AD.

One fifth of participants (13 of 70 (19%)) described their risk of AD dementia by citing additional risk factors, such as diet and exercise. Some simply acknowledged that such factors also play a role in determining one’s risk, while others felt they could lower their risk if they were to “change my diet, do some exercising, brain stuff, to try to keep it away.”

Feelings about result

Homozygotes’ emotional reactions fell into four categories: positive, negative, mixed (i.e., both positive and negative), or neutral. At Time 1, a third of homozygotes expressed either wholly positive (3 of 19 (16%)) or wholly negative (4 of 19 (21%)) emotions. Positive reactions were of “empowerment.” They explained that knowing their APOE status enabled them to “prepare ahead of time…prepare for my later life” and to “make plans based upon the probabilities that I would, in fact, develop Alzheimer’s disease.” Exclusively negative emotions were feelings of being “devastated, “sad,” and “concern[ed],” and included fears of burdening others. Another third of homozygotes expressed a mix of both positive and negative emotions (6 of 19 (32%)). The following is a typical finding: “I felt like a domino fell…but on the other hand, it’s empowering. …I can contribute to the science of it [Alzheimer’s]…I can’t do anything about my genes, but I can do something about the science.” The final third of homozygotes were emotionally neutral (6 of 19 (32%)), stating that they “just accepted [the APOE result] as fact” or as “just one of those things.”

Heterozygotes’ emotional reactions at Time 1 fell into the same categories—positive, negative, mixed, or neutral—though wholly positive reactions were more prominent. Positive emotions (16 of 31 (52%)) included empowerment but also relief. Heterozygotes felt empowered by their ability to “look toward the future and make plans and everything like that,” and several specified that “I was just glad it wasn’t two fours.” Negative reactions (6 of 31 (19%)) included a “sinking feeling” at the thought of developing cognitive impairment. A fifth of participants (7 of 31 (23%)) reported mixed emotions.

Nearly all non-carriers, most of whom had expected to be ε4 carriers, expressed exclusively positive feelings (18 of 20 (90%)). One participant remarked “I was ready to dance, I was thrilled,” while another described “a weight…being lifted off of my shoulders.” Some non-carriers expressed a tempered optimism, saying that while they felt happy about their result, they were also aware of the possibility that non-carriers could develop AD. Some also expressed relief for their loved ones because they inferred from their own results that it was unlikely either their children or siblings carried an ε4 allele.

At Time 2, feelings amongst the homo- and heterozygotes had shifted toward neutral (32 of 46 (70%); one carrier was not asked this question). Many homozygotes described a process of coming to terms with their ε4 carrier status over the intervening year. Reflecting on his experience, one explained, “I’m just, really fine with it, to be honest with you now. I don’t know if I went through the stages of grief or whatever it was, but I’m…it is what is. I don’t worry about it.” Another said, “I think I was more nervous and upset before, whereas now I’d say I’m…more serene with it; what’s gonna be is going to be.” Heterozygotes also noted that their negative feelings had dissipated, and many explained that they were thinking about their APOE result “less now than I did right after they first told me about it.” Some homo- and heterozygotes noted that “there’s nothing much I can do about it. So, whatever happens, happens.” Several ε4 carriers described feeling “more positive” at Time 2 than they had at Time 1; often, these individuals spoke to the value of knowing their APOE genotype and feeling “relieved to know…happy to know what my potential exposure might be.”

Two-thirds of non-carriers (11 of 16 (69%)) continued to report experiencing “a lot of relief,” being “very grateful,” and “still [feeling] happy” at Time 2. The remaining third (5 of 16 (31%)) were neutral and described themselves as feeling “fine.”

Feelings in light of research participation

At Time 2, half of carriers (24 of 47 (51%)) reported that they were ineligible to participate in the API Generation Program. Of these, many described being disappointed by their inability to join a trial. A homozygote who was ineligible for Generation Study 1 for health-related reasons described himself as “very heartbroken…glad I had the testing done but…very sad I’m not able to continue with the [API Generation] Program.” He continued, “I know I’ve got a higher chance or percentage of getting Alzheimer’s. … I just wish I could be in the study with [my health issues]. It almost makes you feel like you’re broken. … There’s nothing you can do at this point with Alzheimer’s. It’s just scary.” One heterozygote who was ineligible to participate in research because Generation Study 1 only enrolled homozygotes, and Generation Study 2 had not yet opened for enrollment explained, “I was relieved about the result, that I wasn’t a 4/4, but … I wanted to be part of the treatment …, so it was like a double-edged sword.”

Thirteen heterozygotes in our sample had undergone amyloid-β testing between the Time 1 and Time 2 interviews as part of screening for Generation Study 2—which included as an eligibility criterion that ε4 heterozygotes also have elevated amyloid-β. Seven of these heterozygotes were ineligible because the researchers “didn’t find any amyloid.” Some reported that this had made them “feel a lot better…less concerned” about their APOE results. One said, “My family laughed about it in…a dark way, but it’s like, ‘Dad, you’ve always assumed you were going to have Alzheimer’s, and now you don’t. Now you have to kinda figure that out.’” Six heterozygotes had enrolled in Generation Study 2 between their Time 1 and Time 2 interviews. One individual explained that being in the study made her “feel like I can at least take some steps to alleviate my risk, maybe, depending on whether I get the study drug or not.”

Effect of result on perceived memory

Among carriers, roughly half of homo- and heterozygotes (24 of 50 (48%)) said their APOE results had no effect on how they felt about their memory (Table 2). Just under half (23 of 50 (46%)), however, reported being more “sensitive” or “alert” to their memory—feeling more conscious of “senior moments” or thinking about AD when they had trouble remembering things. Two heterozygotes said that the result had validated and provided an explanation for baseline memory concerns.

Non-carriers reported either no change in how they felt about their memory (8 of 20 (40%)) or feeling reassured and being less hard on themselves during forgetful moments than they had been previously (9 of 20 (45%)). One remarked, “I don’t leap to a dementia or Alzheimer’s conclusion quickly, like I had in the past.” Three non-carriers did, however, feel frustrated that they could no longer attribute memory concerns to AD and felt they “shouldn’t be forgetting stuff.” Their APOE results failed to provide a satisfying explanation for their ongoing cognitive complaints.

How APOE results compare to other health information

Across all participants, nearly two-thirds (41 of 67 (61%); three were not asked this question) felt the APOE result was different from other types of medical information. Amongst the 41 participants who indicated that the result was different, explanations for why varied between carriers and non-carriers (Table 3).

Of the 12 non-carriers who said that APOE results are different from other types of medical information, more than half (7 of 12 (58%)) explained that their APOE results—unlike other (impliedly positive) test results—felt like “nothing significant” or “not relevant.” One remarked, “You don’t go around telling people that you had a glucose test and you’re not diabetic.”

Carriers who endorsed the claim that APOE results are different commonly explained that APOE results are more uncertain than other test results (12 of 29 (41%)). They emphasized the APOE result was “just a risk factor.” Several contrasted APOE testing with blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol testing, or even mammograms, which they perceived as “definitive” while APOE only signals a “likelihood.” Additionally, some carriers noted the current lack of a disease-modifying therapy for AD (5 of 29 (17%)). These individuals were pained by the idea that, unlike “kidney stones” or “broken bones,” nothing could be done to treat or prevent dementia caused by AD. In many cases, this lack of medical actionability contributed to the emotionally fraught perception of the result. However, many who noted there is no disease-modifying therapy added that they were glad to be participating in research: “if it doesn’t help me, maybe it’ll help someone else.”

Nearly a quarter of ε4 carriers distinguished APOE results from other medical tests results in terms of the emotional weight of AD, talking about “heartbreak,” “pain,” and “baggage” (7 of 29 (24%)). One interviewee explained that dementia leaves just a “shell of the person.” Another described the sadness family members experience watching a “person going downhill.” Stigma was also emphasized as a point of difference (7 of 29 (24%)). Participants worried the result would cause others “to look at me…differently” or to “look[] at me and pity[] me.”

Finally, a portion of ε4 carriers who endorsed the claim that APOE results are different pointed to the genetic nature of APOE testing as a distinguishing factor (6 of 29 (21%)), though this cut different ways. Whereas one carrier explained that because the result was genetic, he felt comfort knowing “[i]t’s nothing that’s my fault,” another felt discomfited by the implications for relatives, noting that they “could…have this [ε4 allele] as well.”

Changes in health behaviors

Nearly half of homozygotes (9 of 19 (47%)) reported changes in health behaviors, while just under a third of heterozygotes (10 of 31 (32%)) and of non-carriers (6 of 20 (30%)) reported such changes. Across all groups, the most common changes were to diet (14 of 70 (20%)) and exercise (15 of 70 (21%)). While some participants reported generally healthier eating—such as more vegetables or fewer processed foods—others had adopted specific diets such as an “Alzheimer’s Prevention” or Mediterranean diet. Interviewees described their APOE results as “increased motivation” for exercise like walking or visiting the gym. A handful of individuals (6 of 70 (9%)) were keeping their minds “active” by playing computer games, learning new languages, or staying socially engaged, and a few (4 of 70 (6%)) were aiming to get adequate sleep. Four carriers but no non-carriers reported adding supplements, including cannabidiol (CBD), fish oil, and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), to their regimen.

Changes in future plans

Just under half of carriers reported making changes to their future plans after learning their APOE result (22 of 50 (44%)); changes were slightly more common among heterozygotes than among homozygotes (48% vs. 42%). Among those carriers who reported any change to future plans, the most common changes were in financial planning (11 of 22 (50%)). Many intended to revisit or had already revisited their finances, with several specifically mentioning the purchase of long-term care insurance. Interviewees often ruminated on whether they would like to move to a different home or whether they would prefer to receive care at home or in a nursing home in the future (7 of 22 (32%)). Some alluded to considerations of family members’ proximity or expressed worry about burdening others with caregiving responsibilities (5 of 22 (23%)). Many participants also described changes to leisure plans, mentioning a desire to travel or spend more time with family while they were still cognitively and functionally able (8 of 22 (36%)).

Three-quarters of non-carriers (15 of 20 (75%)) denied making changes in future plans. The few who reported any change articulated feeling their future was more “open” now and described putting their “plans into effect” with greater confidence.

Effects of result in the workplace

At the Time 2 interview, 22 participants—including carriers and non-carriers—were still working outside the home, full- or part-time. These individuals were asked about the effects of learning their APOE result on their work. A third (7 of 22 (32%)) indicated that it was affecting their work activities. Two carriers described being bothered by the possibility of AD, particularly during forgetful moments. For instance, one heterozygote said, “I guess it bothers me a little bit. One day a couple months ago at work I couldn’t remember my employee number … and I was like, ‘How could I not remember that?’ … I was going, ‘Oh my god, here it’s [Alzheimer’s] started.’” One homozygote explained that she was now planning to retire earlier because her APOE result was “kind of a reality check that we don’t want to wait.” Two heterozygotes reported taking precautions; of these, one explained that she was organizing materials so that if she left her job, others could more easily take over her work responsibilities. Other employed carriers (3 of 19 (16%)) expressed intentions to keep working because of perceived benefits like “structure” and “mental stimulation” that could act “as a safeguard against losing any skills.” One non-carrier described feeling more confident in his ability to continue working after learning his APOE result. Several individuals who were retired but engaged in volunteering reported that knowledge of their APOE result was affecting how they thought about their volunteer activities in similar ways.

The 22 participants who were still working at Time 2 were asked whether they felt comfortable sharing their APOE test results with their employers. Although some (3 of 22 (14%)) said that they might tell “if it becomes necessary, and I really am not performing at the level that they would need me to” or “if I start having problems with memory,” the general sentiment was that they would not share. Many expressed concerns “any kind of genetic testing could be used against you when it comes to … job security or even obtaining a job.” A homozygote offered a typical response: “I just didn’t really see any reason to [tell]. … I don’t want to wear a badge that says I’ve got a higher probability of getting Alzheimer’s … I didn’t see any benefit for them or to me in giving them that information.”

Pursuit of APOE testing by blood relatives

At Time 2, many SOKRATES II participants had discussed APOE testing with blood relatives. Five (5 of 63 (8%)) had “sen[t] all the information” about APOE testing to a relative or “encouraged them to” get an APOE test, but they did not know if their relatives had yet reached a decision about whether to pursue APOE testing or not. Eleven participants (11 of 63 (17%)), heterozygotes and non-carriers only, identified relatives—mostly siblings—who had expressed interest in or planned to undergo APOE testing in the future. Six participants (6 of 63 (10%)), five homozygotes and one heterozygote, reported that a sibling had already undergone APOE testing. One homozygote explained that his brother had learned he too is a homozygote; he continued, “The two of us are kind of in the same boat, … I mean, I feel bad for him, but it actually is a little comforting to know that there’s somebody else.” Of the five homozygotes who reported that a sibling had undergone genetic testing, two indicated that their sibling had subsequently decided not to learn the result after experiencing “some anxiety” and not feeling they “could handle” the result. Some interviewees (7 of 63 (11%)) had talked about APOE testing with relatives—mostly siblings—who ultimately decided against testing.

DISCUSSION

APOE genetic testing is emerging as a means to identify persons at risk of MCI or dementia due to AD—that is, who might benefit from a disease-modifying therapy—and also to ascertain the risks of such a therapy. Our findings from cognitively unimpaired persons aged 60 to 75 support the results of prior studies that examined the effects of APOE ε4 disclosure. Past studies have examined disclosure to cognitively unimpaired adults, though data on APOE ε4 homozygotes has to date been limited.[19–31] In general, these studies show that persons do not experience adverse psychological outcomes post-disclosure; however, they do experience an impact of the event, such as ruminating about the result. Our findings are similar. At Time 1, homozygotes and heterozygotes participating in SOKRATES II described feeling sadness and concern due to learning their increased risk of AD, but they also described feeling empowered by their ability to plan ahead in light of the information. By Time 2, many of the negative emotions homo- and heterozygotes initially experienced had dissipated as they reconciled themselves to their carrier status and thought less often about their results. As in other studies, we found an association between learning one is an ε4 carrier and health behavior changes, use of dietary supplements, and purchasing of long-term care insurance.[19,21,22,25,30] Our findings also extend prior studies by answering questions germane to clinical practice.

Carriers felt APOE test results were different from other medical test results due to the particular emotional weight of AD and the uncertainty of the result, as APOE is a susceptibility gene not a deterministic one. Additionally, some explained that, unlike other medical test results, information about AD risk is not medically actionable. These interviews were conducted prior to FDA’s approval of Aduhelm. Current practice guidelines recommend against clinical APOE testing due, in part, to the longstanding lack of medical actionability.[3,4] As described above, SOKRATES II participants learned their APOE results in the process of screening for the API Generation Program, a pair of randomized controlled trials testing investigational disease-modifying treatments for AD. Some carriers subsequently enrolled in these trials. They noted research participation could directly benefit them—though they recognized it was possible to receive either study drug or placebo—as well as advance science. Carriers who underwent APOE testing but were ineligible to participate in the API Generation Program described feeling disappointment knowing their APOE status put them at increased risk for AD yet being unable to participate in research. These findings suggest that the availability of a disease-modifying therapy will influence a person’s desire to learn an APOE result. This hypothesis is bolstered by prior research exploring willingness to take a predictive blood test for AD; in a 2001 survey, 61.1% of respondents stated that lack of preventive treatments was a primary reason not to be tested.[32] Further, our data suggest that for some individuals, availability of a disease-modifying therapy may mediate the impact of learning an APOE result. Though limited, our data indicate that other information about AD risk—for example, a favorable amyloid-β PET scan result—may also mediate the impact of learning an APOE result.

Carriers expressed a fear of stigma—inaccurate and damaging beliefs, attitudes, and feelings —and discrimination—unjust or prejudicial treatment. Though cognitively unimpaired, carriers worried that if others learned they carried ε4 alleles, they would be viewed or treated differently. Unfortunately, these concerns are likely reasonable.[36] In light of concerns about stigma, carriers engaged in careful decision making around whether to share their result in the workplace. Although the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) offers employment protections to cognitively unimpaired ε4 carriers, SOKRATES II participants generally indicated they would withhold their results from their employers to forestall discrimination.[33] A key finding from SOKRATES II is that ε4 carriers found the process of deciding to share with others—or not to share—as more emotionally and psychologically burdensome than they had anticipated.[33] As APOE testing becomes routine in the clinical setting, there is a need to develop policies and procedures that allow persons at risk for AD to live well. Stigma of AD is a widespread problem that must be mitigated through compelling counter-narratives in public health messaging and clinical services.[34,35] This will help individuals with AD dementia but also those who are at risk for it.

For carriers, learning their APOE result validated pre-existing concerns about their memory or introduced new concerns. Our qualitative findings add context to quantitative research showing that adults who know they are ε4 carriers judge their memories more harshly and perform worse on objective memory tests than others who do not know they are ε4 carriers.[28] By contrast, participants who learned they were non-carriers were “relieved” and many reframed or reinterpreted memory concerns, though they generally understood that the APOE result did not rule out the possibility that they would eventually develop dementia. Some non-carriers, however, felt frustrated by the lack of explanation for persistent memory concerns. Such frustration should be anticipated and addressed as APOE testing becomes more widespread in clinical practice.

Finally, irrespective of their ε4 carrier status, SOKRATES II participants were mindful that their genetic testing result had implications for themselves and also for others. This reflected awareness of both the informal caregiving burden dementia often entails as well as the heritability of ε4 alleles. Although SOKRATES II participants reported discussing the possibility of genetic testing with blood relatives, relatively few family members had undergone or planned to undergo APOE testing, and others had actively decided against it. Clinical APOE testing may become more common with the availability of Aduhelm. The FDA-approved label for Aduhelm, which indicates that treatment should be initiated in patients with MCI or mild dementia, has been criticized because it does not specifically recommend amyloid-β or APOE testing.[17,18] Yet, clinicians and researchers have suggested that “[r]isk stratification with APOE ε4 genotyping may help guide treatment decisions” and inform clinical management.[11] As a result, there soon may be increased demand for APOE testing amongst clinicians and patients, as well as increased willingness among insurers to cover testing. Older adults who undergo APOE testing in the course of seeking an Aduhelm prescription will learn about their own AD-related risks while also gaining insights into the genetic risks of others. By extension, family members may gain insights into themselves, which they do or do not want.

Limitations

SOKRATES II was a relatively small sample, and participants—though reflective of the API Generation Program—are demographically homogeneous and not reflective of AD patients generally. Moreover, many of the SOKRATES II participants expected to carry at least one ε4 allele due to a family history of AD. This limits the generalizability of our results and reflects a broader challenge for AD research: AD is disproportionately prevalent among African American and Hispanic older adults, but minority participation in research remains low.[37] Further research on APOE disclosure with representative populations is essential in light of documented differences in knowledge, awareness, and cultural beliefs about AD among different racial and ethnic groups.[38] The importance of this research is also heightened by the fact that the ε4 allele is “more common among those of African ancestry, but has a smaller—though still important—relationship with cognitive decline in this population.”[39] Individual and social factors may contribute to a decision to seek or forgo APOE testing; we did not follow individuals who declined testing.

Participants underwent standardized education and disclosure processes tailored for APOE as part of their screening for the API Generation Program.[12] The interviews do not suggest that this process needs to change but rather highlight outcomes of APOE testing when these procedures are included. We acknowledge that the API Generation Program counseling and disclosure process was time and resource intensive, and may not be scalable, particularly if APOE testing transpires in an increasingly broad range of clinical settings. When there is more heterogeneity in education and disclosure processes, the impact of learning one’s APOE result may differ. As APOE testing is poised to be more widely adopted, the AD field should consider development and assessment of other evidence-based education and disclosure modalities—such as self-directed education—to promote safety and understanding of results. These modalities should draw lessons from research on APOE disclosure.

CONCLUSION

APOE testing and disclosure are more and more a part of studies of disease-modifying treatments for AD, and it is reasonable to expect they will soon be adopted more widely in clinical practice. Our findings offer glimpses of a potential future patient experience for cognitively unimpaired adults: being told about one’s risk of MCI or dementia due to AD genes or biomarkers and then taking a disease-specific treatment to reduce that risk. In conjunction with prior studies, our results should inform further development of evidence-based strategies to communicate results to cognitively unimpaired older adults across diverse settings. Moving into these settings, providers should be sensitive to how APOE results shape self-perceptions and attitudes about memory, raise concerns about stigma and discrimination in personal and professional relationships, influence major decisions such as the timing of retirement, and can have follow-on effects on family members.

Table 2. Answers to the question “How has learning the APOE result affected how you feel about your memory?”

Key Themes	Illustrative Quotes	Totals (n=70)	
Homozygote (n= 19+)	Heterozygote (n=31)	Non-carrier (n=20)	
Learning the APOE result had no effect on memory.	10	Oh, honestly I don’t think it’s affected how I feel about my memory. I tend to make more jokes, like some humorous comment about … “Oh, just wait until I can’t remember that.”	14	It doesn’t affect me at all.	8	Because everything I was doing before, I’m doing now. And so, it didn’t spur me to do anything differently.	32	
Learning the APOE result validated concerns about memory.	0		2	It just validated it.	0		2	
Learning the APOE result heightened awareness of memory issues.	8	I guess I’m a little more cautious. I do have, when I can’t think of something that I think that I should know and it doesn’t come to me, then I think, “Oh, well. Yeah, this could be related,” although at the same time, there’s not a whole lot I can do about it right now.	15	Well, … when a little blip comes up, I think, “Oh, is this how it happens? Is this how it feels at first?”	0		23	
Learning the APOE result provided reassurance about memory.	0		0		9	Well, I think it just confirmed that I was not in any immediate or greater danger of starting to get senile.	9	
Learning the APOE result meant a lack of explanation for ongoing memory concerns.	0		0		3	Yeah, the only thing I think it did is I can no longer blame Alzheimer’s for my memory loss. It limited my sense of humor. Yeah, there are times when I wonder what’s causing … Even though I’m getting older, it’s still hard to ascribe mental issues to nothing, to old age.	3

Table 3. Answers to the question “How is telling your APOE result to people in your life the same as or different from telling them other test results or health information?”

Key Themes	Illustrative Quotes	Totals (n=41*)	
Homozygotes (n=12+)	Heterozygotes (n=17)	Non-carriers (n=12)	
An APOE result is less definitive than other test results or health information.	3	It’s not something we can make specific plans for in the future. We can make general plans if it were to happen. It’s not something that’s impacting me right this minute.	9	The difference to me was some test results are more immediate, for example, if my blood sugar was, let’s just say for the sake of argument, 250. That would be pretty scary because that would mean I’m diabetic and that would be an immediate thing, whereas this [APOE] is something that not only not immediate, but could never even happen.	3	All the APOE does, in my opinion, I could be wrong, all it does is say you have a 15% increase in developing Alzheimer’s. Alzheimer’s is a disease state which has a lot of questions associated with it. You know, why do some people get it? Why do some people not? Why do some people with APO3 not get it and others do?	15	
An APOE result is more emotionally fraught than other test results or health information.	2	I guess Alzheimer’s has a, for lack of a better word, fear factor with it.	5	It’s devastating. It’s heartbreaking, because you lose these people years before they actually die, and it is hard. It is hard, and heartbreaking, because the person who has it, they’re just gone.	2	You know, I think part of it just the baggage that comes with the term Alzheimer’s. People are just … I think people are almost as afraid of that as they are of saying cancer…	9	
An APOE result is associated with greater stigma than other test results or health information.	4	You don’t want people to look at you differently. Be on the lookout for, “Is she losing it?” … Or make assumptions.	3	I don’t wanna give anyone that impression but because I have the gene I’m gonna wind up goofy…start making plans to put me in some home or somewhere.	0		7	
Unlike other test results or health information, there is nothing that can be done for an APOE result.	1	If you have diabetes, you take insulin. If you have heart disease, you stop smoking. Whatever it is, if you have osteoporosis, you exercise differently. There are options to perhaps change your outcome, but not so much here.	4	You don’t have any choice. Like, kidney stones, drink the water. Eat what you’re supposed to do that goes away…This is, you can’t change the numbers. You can help with your exercise and diet and your blood pressure you can help to be in the 75–80%. But, you can’t change that number. It always stays there.	2	I think it’s a little different in the fact that the Alzheimer’s is a very insidious disease, and if you have it, you know you’re not going to get better from it.	7	
Unlike other test results or health information, an APOE result is about my genes.	3	It’s nothing that’s my fault so to speak so it doesn’t bother me at all. It would be easier to say that [I am a homozygote] than to say I got diabetes from eating the wrong way or something. I don’t have diabetes. That would be embarrassing to me to compare to this… Yeah, like lung cancer. You know people think, “Oh yeah, smoking, yeah, it’s all your own fault.	3	But I think what’s interesting about sharing APOE results is that it’s something that hits home to a lot of people, … many of the people that I share that with could, in fact, get this, have this as well, have one of the genes as well.	0		6	
An APOE result is less familiar to others than other test results or health information.	1	[M]ost people don’t even know what the damned gene is, so then I’d have to explain what it is, blah, blah, blah, it doesn’t make any sense.	1	Oh, I suppose it would be different because some of these things that all women get, might say, oh yeah, my doctor did this and this again this year. Now I’m getting my bone density this year and these are the results and so forth but, this one I don’t feel the same way about because it, I don’t know of anybody else that has this.	1	I guess it’s a little different ‘cause everybody has cholesterol. And everybody’s got some number of cholesterol that they can parrot back to you. Or high blood pressure numbers, something like that. When the topics come up everybody says, “Well mine is this and mine is that.” Whereas this [APOE test] everybody doesn’t talk about ‘cause everybody” doesn’t have one.	3	
* This table reflects only those individuals who indicated that, yes, telling your APOE result to others is different than telling them other test results or medical information. Participants’ responses may have been coded for more than one theme. Twenty six participants indicated that telling your APOE result to others is the same as telling them other test results or health information; three participants were not asked this question.

+ One homozygote indicated that he was sharing his APOE result with others to promote Alzheimer’s disease researc
