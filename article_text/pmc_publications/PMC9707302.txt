Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) are clinical syndromes that commonly have underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD), although non-AD pathologies have also been reported. PET imaging allows for identification of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau in AD, so we aimed to assess these in a large cohort to identify patients that do not have evidence for biomarker-defined AD. Eight-one patients, 47 PCA and 34 LPA, underwent extensive neurological and neuropsychological testing, [11C] Pittsburgh compound B, [18F] flortaucipir and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose PETs. Global Aβ and tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were plotted for all patients and outliers, and patients with abnormally low SUVRs compared to the biomarker-classic cohort were identified. Six (7.4%) biomarker-outlier cases were identified, and three patterns were observed: i) negative/borderline Aβ-PET and striking widespread tau-PET uptake (two LPA); ii) negative/borderline Aβ-PET and low tau-PET uptake (three PCA) and iii) elevated Aβ-PET uptake but mild focal tau-PET uptake (one LPA). Among the unusual patients in group ii, two patients showed no abnormal tau uptake suggesting non-AD pathology, with one developing features of corticobasal syndrome and the other dementia with Lewy bodies. The remaining patient showed very mild focal tau uptake. This study demonstrates that a small minority (~8%) of PCA and LPA patients do not show the typical striking patterns of Aβ and tau PET uptake, with only 2% showing absence of both proteins. These findings will help inform the use of molecular PET in clinical treatment trials that include patients with atypical phenotypes of AD.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau proteins in the brain. Patients with AD typically present with prominent episodic memory loss [1], although atypical clinical presentations can occur. Two widely studied phenotypes of atypical AD include posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) [2, 3].

PCA is a young-onset, visual variant of atypical AD with primary visuospatial and visuoperceptual deficits [4]. Prominent clinical symptoms include features of Balint’s (simultanagnosia, optic ataxia, oculomotor apraxia) and Gerstmann’s syndrome (acalculia, finger agnosia, dysgraphia/agraphia) [4]. PCA patients often have good insight into their symptoms [5, 6], and relatively preserved episodic memory and comportment [4]. Language decline typically occurs later in the disease [7, 8]. Neuroimaging features of PCA include atrophy on MRI and hypometabolism on [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET in the posterior occipital and parietal lobes [2, 9-11], often with greater involvement of the right hemisphere [10, 12]. In pathological studies, almost 80% of PCA cases have underlying AD [13, 14], but there are some cases that can be attributed to other neurodegenerative diseases [15, 16], such as corticobasal degeneration (CBD) [17], Lewy body disease (LBD) [15, 16] and sometimes prion disease [16, 18].

LPA is a young-onset, language variant of atypical AD [3, 19]. Clinical symptoms include hesitant speech, anomia, deficits in sentence repetition and phonological errors in speech. Grammar and semantic knowledge are relatively preserved [19]. Neuroimaging features of LPA include atrophy and hypometabolism in the left lateral temporal and inferior parietal regions [3, 20, 21]. The most common underlying pathology in LPA is AD [22-25], although cases of LBD [26] and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and have also been reported, the latter particularly when related to a progranulin gene mutation [27]. Prion disease was also determined as an underlying pathology of LPA in a unique case [28].

PET biomarkers for Aβ and tau are now available that allow the in vivo diagnosis of AD [29]. Previous imaging studies have found that approximately 75% of PCA patients [30] and 70-88% of LPA patients [31, 32] show evidence of Aβ deposition on PET, although estimates can vary across centers and these studies have not considered the tau-PET profile of these patients. At the group-level, cohorts of Aβ-positive PCA and LPA patients show striking tau uptake on PET, with patterns of uptake largely consistent with the patterns of neurodegeneration in these syndromes [33, 34]. It is, however, unknown what proportion of PCA and LPA patients show evidence of tau ligand uptake on PET. This is important because evidence of both Aβ and tau deposition on PET is required for a biomarker-defined diagnosis of AD [29]. Furthermore, elevated Aβ deposition is not always associated with elevated tau PET uptake [35].

To address these knowledge gaps, we aimed to assess both Aβ and tau PET in a large cohort of patients clinically diagnosed with PCA or LPA to determine what proportion of patients do not have evidence for elevated Aβ and tau uptake. We also aimed to assess the clinical and imaging profiles of these patients to better understand how they differ from classic cases of PCA and LPA that do show biomarker evidence of AD. A better understanding of individual-level molecular PET findings in these syndromes will be crucial to aid diagnosis, help in the interpretation of molecular PET, and guide inclusion of these patients in clinical treatment trials for AD.

Methods

2.1 Patients

Forty seven patients that fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for PCA [4] and thirty four patients that fulfilled clinical diagnostic criteria for LPA [3, 19] were recruited by the Neurodegenerative Research group (NRG) from the Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, between June 09, 2016 and November 11, 2021 into an NIH-funded grant. All patients were enrolled into the study regardless of sex and age and underwent extensive neurological evaluations by one of two behavioral neurologists (KAJ or JGR) and neuropsychological testing overseen by a neuropsychologist (MMM). All patients underwent [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET to assess Aβ deposition, [18F] flortaucipir (AV-1451) PET to assess tau deposition, FDG PET and structural MRI. Per protocol, all clinical diagnoses were rendered prior to, and hence blinded to, imaging results. The majority of patients also underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype testing [36], and those with unusual Aβ and/or tau PET uptake were screened for microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT)[37] and progranulin (GRN) mutations [27], as previously described.

2.2 Patient consent and protocols

The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in this study.

2.3 Clinical testing

The neurological evaluations performed on the PCA and LPA patients included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Battery (MoCA) for assessing general cognitive function [38], Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) to assess functional impairment [39], Ishihara test to assess colour vision [40], Cambridge Behavioral Inventory (CBI) to assess behavioral changes [41], Movement Disorders Society sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson’s disease rating scale III (UPDRS III) to assess for parkinsonism [42], and the Western Aphasia Battery ideomotor apraxia subtest to assess ideomotor praxis [43]. Additional test for simultanagnosia included images of overlapping line drawings, images of fragmented numbers, and Navon figures, with performance scored on a 20-point scale (scores under 17 considered abnormal) [44]. The presence of oculomotor apraxia, optic ataxia, dyslexia, hemispheric neglect, apperceptive prosopagnosia and finger agnosia was documented. The neuropsychological evaluations included the 15-item Boston Naming Test (BNT) for assessing confrontational naming [45], Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Exam (BDAE) repetition subtest for assessing sentence repetition [46], Auditory Verbal Learning Test Recognition Percent Correct (RPC) measuring episodic verbal memory [47, 48], Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (Rey-O) for assessing visuoconstructional ability [49, 50], Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP) Cubes for assessing visuospatial ability and VOSP Letters for assessing visuoperceptual ability [51], and the Wechsler Memory Scale III, digit span subtest (WMS ds) for assessing attention and working memory [52].

2.4 Image acquisition

All patients underwent a 3T volumetric MRI, which included a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence. All PET scans were acquired on a PET/CT scanner. For Aβ PET, patients were injected with ~ 628MBq (range 385-723MBq) of PiB followed by a 40 mins uptake period. For tau PET, patients were injected with ~ 370MBq (range 333-407MBq) of [18F] flortaucipir, followed by an 80 mins uptake period. For both, Aβ and tau PET, acquisition was 20 mins. The scans consisted of four, 5 minute dynamic frames after a low dose CT image. For FDG-PET, patients were injected with ~ 459MBq (range 367-576MBq) of fluorodeoxyglucose followed by a 30 min uptake period. PET acquisition was carried out for 8 mins, consisting of four, 2 minute dynamic frames after a low dose CT image. Standard corrections were applied and the PET sinograms were reconstructed into a 256mm FOV. The four individual frames were averaged for analysis [53]. Detailed acquisition details have been previously published [54].

2.5 Image processing

The Aβ and tau PET images were registered to their corresponding subject-space MPRAGE T1-weighted MRI using SPM12. Regional PET values were calculated by using ANTs [55] to propagate the Mayo Clinic Adult Lifespan Template (MCALT) atlas to native MPRAGE space. Unified segmentation [56] in SPM12 was used to determine the tissue probabilities of each MPRAGE scan with MCALT tissue priors and settings [57]. For the Aβ-PET, a global PiB uptake value was calculated, as previously described [58]. Median PiB uptake was calculated for each patient across gray and white matter and was divided by the cerebellar crus gray matter median uptake value to generate standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). An SUVR cut-point of 1.48 was used to define Aβ-positivity [58]. For the tau-PET, a summary metric was generated by a weighted average of the uptake across the following 11 regions of interest (ROI): superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus, superior occipital gyrus, middle occipital gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus. These ROIs were chosen because they cover the regions that show greatest tau-PET uptake in PCA and LPA [59, 60]. Median tau PET values were calculated for each ROI across gray and white matter and were divided by the cerebellar crus gray matter median uptake value to generate SUVRs. Patterns of hypometabolism on FDG-PET were assessed at the individual patient level using the clinical tool of 3D stereotactic surface projections [61] and CortexID software (GE Healthcare). Each FDG-PET scan was normalized to the pons and compared with an age-segmented normative database (consisting of 294 healthy controls, age 31-89 years), yielding a 3D stereotactic surface projections z-score image.

2.6 Identifying outlier cases based on biomarkers

The global Aβ SUVRs and the tau-PET summary metric SUVRs were plotted for all PCA and LPA cases and outliers were identified as those patients who had negative or borderline (less than 1.60 SUVR) Aβ PET SUVRs or abnormally low (no or focal uptake) tau PET SUVRs (will be referred to as biomarker-outlier cases). Patients who showed elevated Aβ and tau PET SUVRs will be referred to as biomarker-classic cases. Visual reads of the Aβ and tau-PET scans were performed in all biomarker-outlier cases to confirm the ROI-based classification.

Results

Of the total cohort of 81 patients, six (7.4%) were identified as biomarker-outlier patients (Figure 1). Five patients (6.2%) showed negative or borderline Aβ PET SUVRs, with two of these patients showing clearly elevated tau PET SUVRs (Alow Thigh) and three showing relatively low or a negative tau PET SUVRs (Alow Tlow) compared to the rest of the cohort. One further patient showed clearly elevated Aβ PET SUVR and low tau PET SUVR (Ahigh Tlow).

3.1 Biomarker-classic demographics and clinical findings

The demographic and clinical features of the biomarker-classic PCA and LPA cohorts are shown in Table 1. The PCA and LPA groups did not differ in sex or education, but the PCA group was slightly younger at age of onset and had a slightly longer disease duration at the time of MRI scan compared to LPA. The frequency of APOE ε4 carriers in PCA was 52%, while LPA was 32%. On clinical testing, the PCA group tended to perform worse on the visual battery (Ishihara, Simultanagnosia, VOSP letters and cubes and the Rey-O complex figure), CDR and CBI, while LPA tended to perform worse on the language battery (BNT, BDAE repetition), as well on the AVLT and WMS-III ds.

3.2 Biomarker-outlier demographics and clinical findings

The demographic and clinical features of each biomarker-outlier patient are shown in Table 1. Of the six biomarker-outlier patients, three were diagnosed as LPA and three as PCA, representing 9% of the LPA cohort and 6.4% of the PCA cohort. The LPA biomarker-outlier patients showed poor naming on the BNT and poor sentence repetition on BDAE-repetition consistent with performance in the biomarker-classic LPA patients (Table 1 and Figure 2). The PCA biomarker-outlier patients showed poor performance on the Ishihara, Simultanagnosia and VOSP cubes tests consistent with performance in the biomarker-classic PCA patients. Individual descriptions of each patient are provided below (Table 1 and Figure 2).

3.2.1 Alow Thigh patient descriptions

Two patients (patients 1 and 2) showed the Alow Thigh biomarker profile, accounting for 2.46% of the total cohort.

Patient 1: Patient 1 was diagnosed with LPA at the age of 78 years with a disease duration of almost 6 years. She had 16 years of education, is an APOE ε4 carrier, had a family history of dementia with Lewy bodies (father affected) and tested negative for MAPT and GRN mutations. She scored 25/30 points on the MoCA. She had hesitant speech with striking anomia and mild impairment in sentence repetition but sparing of visuoperceptual, visuospatial, and visuoconstructional function (Table 1). Auditory attention/working memory was average, and verbal memory was low average. She returned for follow-up one year later, at which point she had moderate cognitive and functional impairment with Gerstmann’s syndrome and severely impaired verbal memory. Auditory attention/working memory was low average, and visuoperceptual, visuospatial and visuoconstructional function remained relatively spared. There was evidence of mild behavioral abnormalities such as acting impulsively and socially embarrassing behavior. Hypometabolism on FDG-PET at baseline was observed predominantly in the temporal lobes, and spreading anteriorly to the temporal poles, with moderate involvement of the parietal and frontal lobes (Figure 3). The global Aβ SUVR was borderline with a value of 1.50 and uptake observed predominantly in the white matter (Figure 3). Flortaucipir uptake was predominantly observed in the temporal and parietal lobes, worse in the left hemisphere (Figure 3). Neuroimaging obtained at follow-up was unusable due to movement artifact.

Patient 2: Patient 2 was first assessed at the age of 69 years, with a disease duration of two years. She had 16 years of education, a family history of AD (aunt affected) and tested negative for the APOE ε4 allele, MAPT and GRN mutations. She underwent a speech-language examination and was diagnosed with progressive fluent aphasia. She had evidence of anomia with a score of 9 on the BNT but with preserved sentence repetition and rare phonological errors, and she had moderate cognitive impairment with a MoCA of 21. She returned for a clinical visit 2-years later, at the age of 73 years, where she had dysgraphia, hesitant speech and scored 4/10 on a sentence repetition task. She was diagnosed with LPA at this visit, at which time she underwent both Aβ and flortaucipir PET (and hence this visit is considered the baseline visit in this study). At this visit, the neurological examination showed severe cognitive and functional impairment with a MoCA score of 0 and CDR-SB of 13, and she was untestable on most other tests. She had further follow-up visits at age 74 and 75 years and was generally untestable at both visits, although there was evidence that she had developed behavioral abnormalities at the third visit (Table 1). There was no evidence of parkinsonism. Severe hypometabolism on FDG-PET was observed at baseline in the temporoparietal cortices, greater in the right hemisphere, with moderate frontal lobe involvement on the right (Figure 3). The global Aβ SUVR was negative at baseline with a value of 1.41 and became borderline at follow-up with a value of 1.54 (Figure 4). Widespread flortaucipir uptake was observed at baseline throughout the lateral temporal, parietal, occipital and frontal lobes, with greater uptake in the right hemisphere in the frontal and occipital lobes (Figure 3); similar patterns were observed at follow-up one-year later (Figure 4).

3.2.2 Alow Tlow patient descriptions

Three patients (patients 3-5) showed the Alow Tlow biomarker profile, accounting for 3.70% of the total cohort.

Patient 3: Patient 3 was diagnosed with PCA at the age of 74 years with a disease duration of 4 years. She had 15 years of education and is an APOE ε4 carrier. She presented with difficulty reading. Neurological examination showed moderate cognitive impairment with a MoCA of 18. She had evidence of oculomotor apraxia and simultanagnosia and showed profound visuospatial and visuoperceptual impairment on the VOSP and Rey-O tests and moderately impaired performance on the Boston Naming Test. In contrast, auditory attention/working memory and verbal memory were low average. She did not have any parkinsonian features or ideomotor apraxia. She returned for a follow-up research visit two years later, at which time she showed further cognitive decline with the MoCA score of 11. She also showed mild attention/working memory deficits and mild impairment in sentence repetition although verbal memory remained relatively spared. A more thorough neuropsychological examination was not possible as the patient was essentially blind. Hypometabolism on FDG-PET at baseline was observed in the occipital lobe, greater in the right hemisphere (Figure 3). The global Aβ SUVR was borderline at baseline and follow-up with values of 1.51 and 1.52, respectively. Very mild and focal flortaucipir uptake was observed bilaterally in the occipital lobe at baseline and follow-up (Figure 4) (Of note, a large amount of off-target uptake was observed in the brain meninges at the baseline scan and occipital uptake declined at follow-up).

Patient 4: Patient 4 was diagnosed with PCA at the age of 60 years with a disease duration of 5 years. He has 12 years of education, with a family history of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (father and uncle affected) and tested negative for APOE ε4. Neurological examination showed moderate cognitive impairment with a MoCA of 18. Simultanagnosia, acalculia, optic ataxia, right visual field deficits were present, but oculomotor apraxia was absent. Neuropsychological testing showed severe visuoperceptual and visuoconstructional deficits. Naming, sentence repetition, auditory attention/working memory, visuospatial ability, and verbal memory were spared (Table 1). He returned for two additional follow-ups, at ages 61 and 62 years. Naming, repetition, auditory attention/working memory, and verbal memory remained normal at the second visit though there was a slight decline on a measure of visuospatial ability. At the third visit, visuoperceptual and visuospatial ability were profoundly impaired. Auditory attention/working memory declined slightly and was low average. There was a more notable decline on repetition and verbal memory, which were mildly impaired. Naming remained preserved. He developed mild ideomotor apraxia and parkinsonism by the third visit, and developed paranoia, visual hallucinations, delusions, and some behavioral changes. Hypometabolism on FDG-PET was observed in the occipital and parietal lobe, bilaterally, with moderate involvement of the frontal and temporal lobes (Figure 3). The global Aβ SUVR was negative at all three time-points (1.42, 1.45 and 1.45). Furthermore, there was no evidence for cortical flortaucipir uptake on PET at any time-point (Figure 4).

Patient 5: Patient 5 was diagnosed with PCA at the age of 66 years, with a disease duration of two years. She has 16 years of education and a family history of AD (mother affected). Neurological examination showed severe cognitive impairment with a MoCA of 15. She had dressing apraxia, with finger agnosia, right left confusion, and acalculia consistent with a Gerstmann’s syndrome and simultanagnosia, while oculomotor apraxia and optic ataxia was absent (Table 1). Neuropsychological testing showed severely impaired visuospatial, visuoconstructional, and verbal memory performances. Naming was also impaired but repetition and visuoperception were normal, and auditory attention/working memory was low average. Marked left upper extremity ideomotor apraxia and cortical sensory findings were observed, with no alien limb, leading to a secondary diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Mild hypometabolism was observed on FDG-PET in the right lateral parietal and frontal lobes (Figure 3). The global Aβ SUVR was negative with a value of 1.40 and there was no evidence for cortical flortaucipir uptake on PET (Figure 3).

3.2.3 Ahigh Tlow patient description

Patient 6: Patient 6 showed the Ahigh Tlow profile. This patient was diagnosed with LPA at the age of 78 years. He has 16 years of education, with no family history, and he tested positive for APOE ε4. Neurological examination showed the MoCA was mildly impaired with a score of 26. Neuropsychological testing showed low average auditory attention/working memory, and mild naming and sentence repetition impairments with preserved visuoperceptual, visuospatial and visuoconstructional ability and verbal memory (Table 1). He returned for follow-up one year later. At this time, moderate cognitive impairment was observed on the MoCA. Remaining performances were largely stable except for a notable drop on verbal memory (moderately impaired). Mild hypometabolism was observed on FDG-PET in the temporal lobe, greater in the left hemisphere (Figure 3). The global Aβ SUVR was positive at both time-points with values of 2.43 and 2.45, with elevated Aβ uptake observed throughout the cortex (Figure 3). Mild and focal flortaucipir uptake was observed in the left lateral temporal lobe at baseline, with uptake in the temporal lobe increasing at follow-up (Figure 4).

Discussion

This study demonstrates that ~8% of PCA and LPA patients do not show the typical striking patterns of elevated Aβ and tau PET uptake. We identified three main patterns in the biomarker-outlier patients: i) negative/borderline Aβ-PET SUVRs and elevated tau-PET SUVRs (Alow Thigh), ii) negative/borderline Aβ-PET SUVRs and low tau-PET SUVRs (Alow Tlow) and iii) elevated Aβ-PET SUVRs and low tau-PET SUVRs (Ahigh Tlow). Both of the Alow Thigh cases were LPA, while all three Alow Tlow cases were PCA, with these PCA patients showing very mild and focal tau-PET uptake on visual review in the occipital lobe which differed from the striking uptake observed in biomarker-classic cases, albeit could still be considered tau-PET positive. Only two PCA patients in the cohort (2%) showed no cortical Aβ or tau and, hence, could confidently be considered to have a non-AD underlying pathology. The Alow Thigh profile is of particular interest as it showed elevated and widespread tau uptake across the cortex but with borderline Aβ uptake, an unusual pattern since in AD pathogenesis, Aβ is considered upstream of tau [62-64].

The Alow Thigh group consisted of two LPA cases and accounts for 2.46% of the entire cohort and 5.88% of all LPA patients. Patient 1 had borderline-positive Aβ PET uptake, while patient 2 had negative Aβ PET uptake on the first visit but showed borderline-positive uptake on the second visit. Tau PET uptake for both cases was widespread with a temporoparietal predominance, which matches expected findings for the LPA phenotype [34]. The FDG-PET findings were also largely consistent with patterns expected for LPA, with temporoparietal hypometabolism in both patients, although both also showed anteromedial temporal involvement, as we have previously published in an independent cohort of Aβ-negative LPA [31]. Given that the Aβ-PET SUVR values were just above the cut-point is it possible that these patients do have underlying AD pathology, as these cases meet criteria for biomarker-AD [29, 65]. However, the fact that the Aβ-PET uptake was very subtle and the tau-PET uptake widespread suggests that tau deposition may have preceded Aβ deposition in these patients. One could also speculate the presence of tangle dominant dementia or FTLD-TDP pathology The relatively high tau-PET levels could reflect off-target binding. However, both patients screened negative for GRN mutations.

The hypothesis that tau may precede Aβ deposition in the Alow Thigh patients contradicts the well-known AD pathogenesis hypothesis [62-64]. However, there are multiple studies that can offer alternate theories. One such study offers the hypothesis of the dual pathway, wherein Aβ and tau are proposed to be driven by a common upstream driver [66]. Another study hints towards the dual pathway hypothesis proposing that tau could be a crucial partner to Aβ, wherein both amplify each other’s toxicity [67, 68]. There are multiple theories which could explain why tau uptake would precede Aβ, but the exact reason for this observation in our study is unclear.

The Alow Tlow group consisted of three PCA cases and accounts for 3.70% of all initial patients, and 6.38% all PCA patients. This group was heterogeneous. Within this group, patient 3 showed focal and mild tau uptake in the occipital lobe, was APOE ε4 carrier and relatively old (~70 years old) compared to the biomarker-classic PCA patients. Here the mild occipital tau uptake was contrasted with the severity of cognitive deficits. The Aβ-PET SUVRs was borderline positive and, hence would meet biomarker criteria for AD [29, 65]. The reason for the low levels of Aβ and tau in this patient is unclear. It is possible that a small amount of pathology was sufficient to cause the clinical syndrome. The mild tau uptake fits with the fact that cortical tau uptake has been shown to be lower in older patients with atypical AD [53]. We could also speculate that these types of patients may only require very low levels of Aβ to initiate the tau cascade. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that another pathology such as Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is known to show occipital tau-PET uptake [69, 70], may be present with the co-existence of low levels of AD. Overall, it is important to note, that the cases with focal tau remained focal over time, not displaying the same level of widespread tau uptake that is typically seen in biomarker-classic cases.

Within the Alow Tlow group, the two remaining PCA patients showed no evidence of cortical tau uptake, and both were Aβ-negative. In fact, patient 4 remained Aβ-negative for three successive visits. Hence, these patients do not meet biomarker-AD criteria, and we can predict that the syndrome results from a non-AD pathology in both patients. Patient 4 developed parkinsonism, paranoia, visual hallucinations, and delusions over time. His expected underlying pathology based on these features was DLB [4, 16]. Indeed, the parietoccipital FDG-PET findings could be consistent with both PCA and DLB, although the relatively symmetric findings could have pointed towards DLB [71]. Patient 5 presented with ideomotor apraxia and cortical sensory findings leading to a secondary diagnosis of CBS. Her FDG-PET showing posterior frontal and parietal hypometabolism was consistent with the diagnosis of CBS [72]. Hence, her probable underlying pathology was predicted to be CBD [17].

Only one LPA patient showed the Ahigh Tlow profile. Patient 6 had mild impairment at baseline, was an APOE ε4 carrier and had high Aβ PET uptake throughout the cortex. Tau uptake was focal and localized to the left temporal lobe asymmetrically. Given the positive Aβ and tau PET findings this patient likely has underling AD pathology [29, 65]. The subtle tau-PET findings could have been due to the relatively old age of the patient (78 years) [53] or the fact that the patient was seen at a relatively early stage of the disease. The high Aβ uptake could, however, also be related to the old age of this patient. Interestingly, longitudinal follow-up was available for this patient, and tau uptake showed significant progression within the left temporal lobe. Previous studies have found that tau accumulation over time tends to occur in regions that did not show the highest uptake at baseline, showing spread of tau to other relatively unaffected regions [60, 73, 74]. In this patient we appeared to have captured the process in the early stage where tau is still accumulating in the temporal lobes.

A limitation of the study was the lack of available cut-off thresholds for tau PET positivity using our cortical tau-PET metric. In this study we showed that the cortical tau-PET metric was able to detect tau uptake in most of the cohort since the biomarker-classic patients showed high levels of uptake in cortical regions. However, the metric was unable to detect very low and focal tau uptake in many of the biomarker-outlier patients. This is not necessarily a bad thing since many of these patients may have a non-AD pathology, but it should be considered when utilizing a summary tau-PET metric. Visual assessment of the flortaucipir PET will be needed to make sure these cases do not go undetected. It is interesting to note that of the four patients that were identified as having low tau-PET uptake, only one of them had a clearly elevated Aβ-PET, suggesting that low tau-PET uptake is often also associated with low Aβ-PET uptake in these atypical AD phenotypes. It will be interesting for future studies to investigate whether similar focal patterns of mild tau-PET uptake are observed in cognitively normal controls. While many of our patients had a follow-up visit, further follow-up will be needed to assess change in Aβ and tau, along with evaluation of other biomarkers such as CSF or plasma for the diagnosis of AD and/or DLB and eventual autopsy examination will be needed to confirm our autopsy predictions.

Conclusion

In summary, this study shows that a small group of LPA and PCA patients do not neatly fit into the category of biomarker-classic atypical AD. The underlying pathology is unclear in many of these patients and whether they reflect an early stage of AD, another pathology or a mixed pathology will require pathological validation. The inclusion of tau-PET scans, in addition to Aβ-PET, provided additional information which helped support the presence of presumed AD pathology in some patients. This study broadens our understanding of the atypical AD phenotypes of PCA and LPA and demonstrates the clinical utility of molecular PET imaging in these patients. Our findings will also help inform the use of molecular PET in clinical treatment trials that include patients with atypical phenotypes of AD.

Figure 1: Scatter plot between Aβ-PET SUVRs and tau-PET SUVRs. The plot shows the distribution of biomarker-classic and biomarker-outlier patients with the tau summary metric and the Aβ-PET threshold, marked with a dotted black line. The biomarker-classic patients are shown as ghosted-out, semitransparent stars, with purple representing PCA and orange representing LPA cases. The biomarker-outlier patients are shown in shown in solid symbols, sorted based on their groups and coloured based on their diagnosis i.e., purple for PCA and orange for LPA.

Figure 2: Associations between clinical test scores and disease duration for biomarker-classic and biomarker-outlier cases. The plot shows the distribution of biomarker-classic and biomarker-outlier patients. Here longitudinal data for every available biomarker-outlier patient has been plotted and indicated by arrows. The biomarker-outliers are shown in shown in solid symbols, sorted based on their groups and coloured based on their diagnosis i.e., purple for PCA and orange for LPA. While the biomarker-classic cases are shown as ghosted-out, semitransparent stars, coloured based on their diagnosis i.e., purple for PCA and orange for LPA. The median score for the biomarker-classic PCA and LPA scores are represented with a solid line across the plot (purple for PCA and orange for LPA). Each patient can be followed across plots based on their disease duration (x-axis values) as they are unique across the biomarker-outlier patients.

Figure 3: Neuroimaging baseline scans of Biomarker-outlier patients. The figure includes FDG PET (hypometabolism), Aβ-PET (Aβ uptake) and tau-PET (tau uptake) for all patients. Each patient has their group and diagnosis marked on the left and right top corner respectively.

Figure 4: Neuroimaging follow up scans of Biomarker-outlier patients. The figure includes FDG PET (hypometabolism), Aβ-PET (Aβ uptake) and tau-PET (tau uptake) for all patients that had a follow up visit available. Each case has their group and diagnosis marked on the left and right top corner, respectively. Patients 2, 3 and 6 have one follow up visit, while patient 4 has two follow up visits.

* Patient scored 9/10 on the WAB repetition subset.

Highlights

Only a small proportion of PCA and LPA cases do not show elevated Aβ and tau uptake on PET

Low Aβ uptake was commonly associated with low tau uptake, particularly in PCA

Biomarker-outlier cases with extensive tau deposition, but low amyloid, were observed

Biomarker-outlier cases are a heterogenous group in which Aβ and tau PET characteristics reflect the existence of underlying non-AD pathologies.
