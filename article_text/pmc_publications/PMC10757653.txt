Background:

Cognitive assessment of older adults typically includes symptom reports and objective evaluations. However, there is often poor agreement between these measures. Cultural norms, stress, and anxiety may also influence cognitive self-appraisal and performance.

Objective:

This study investigated whether the disparity between subjective cognitive concerns and objective cognitive performance is related to measures of anxiety and stress in older Black and African American adults.

Methods:

Telephone screenings were administered to 206 older adults (ages 64–94) during the first year of the pandemic. Demographic data, objective memory (Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status [TICS-m]), subjective memory (Cognitive Change Questionnaire [CCQ]), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS4) were measured.

Results:

Neither GAD-7 nor PSS-4 moderated the relationship between TICS-m and CCQ, and TICS-m scores weakly predicted subjective CCQ scores (F(1, 197)=4.37, p=.038, R2=.022). A Metacognition Discrepancy Index (MDI) was calculated from the standardized residual after regressing TICS-m on CCQ scores to quantify the discrepancy between cognitive self-appraisal and objective cognitive functioning. MDI correlated with stress and anxiety (r’s=.294, .396, p’s&lt;.001).

Conclusions:

Discrepancies exist between objectively measured and self-evaluated cognition. Elevations in stress and anxiety are associated with greater overestimation of cognitive difficulties relative to objective performance. Pandemic-related stressors may have worsened anxiety and diminished self-appraisal of cognitive abilities for some individuals, while others remain reluctant to acknowledge impairments. Social and emotional factors are meaningful considerations in assessing cognitive difficulties.

pmcINTRODUCTION

Metacognition, the ability to accurately assess and reflect on one’s internal mental processes, is essential in evaluating cognitive resources and performance. A perceived change in cognitive ability is often the first symptom recognized by older adults who later develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or, eventually, dementia [1]. However, other etiologies of cognitive symptoms are possible [2]. Prompt identification of perceived cognitive decline is critical for clinicians to treat reversible conditions and for researchers to target cognitive health-promoting interventions during the earliest possible stage of the disease. Inaccurate metacognition is associated with worry, negative emotions, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and hallucination proneness for individuals experiencing psychological distress [11, 15, 16, 17].

Clinicians frequently administer subjective and objective assessments of cognition [3] to differentiate older adults with bona fide cognitive impairment (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or MCI) from persons expressing a subjective cognitive decline (SCD; [20]). There is often a poor agreement between subjective and objective measures, with small and inconsistent associations found in meta-analyses [4, 5]. Previous research suggests that subjective cognitive appraisal, mainly when supported by informant reports, may be more sensitive to MCI than objective cognitive performance measures [6]. However, cognitive self-appraisal may be influenced by anxiety, depression, stress, and memory loss itself [6, 7, 8, 9 for meta-analysis and review, see 10]. Cognitive, psychological, and affective processes dynamically interact with the metacognitive process to influence the accuracy of self-appraisal of cognition.

Little research has examined the correlates of metacognition discrepancies in older adults at risk for AD and even less in older Black and African American (B/AA) adults, who have reported a high incidence of race-related stressors [18]. In two studies focused on older B/AA adults, subjective cognitive complaints were associated with mood [16, 19]. Compared to non-Hispanic White participants, B/AA older adults report subjective cognitive complaints less frequently [24, 25], although the opposite trend has been noted for middle-aged adults [26]. Subjective cognitive complaints are not consistently associated with objective cognitive performance in older B/AA adults [16, 19, 24], yet contrasting findings have also been reported [25]. A concomitant high incidence of mood disorder and stress [18] and greater risk for dementia [27] for B/AA older adults than non-Hispanic White adults is also observed. Given this confluence of risk factors, characterizing the interaction of reported mood symptoms with SCD among older B/AA adults is needed to interpret potential applications of metacognition assessments in community settings more effectively.

For older B/AA adults, COVID-19 pandemic-related challenges amplified existing disparities [45]. These disparate burdens may be attributable to reduced access to healthcare, increased risk for close personal contact through employment as an essential worker or living in high-density housing, and pre-existing comorbid health conditions [46, 47, 48]. Beyond the physical risks, psychosocial stress increased for people from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds during the pandemic, especially for females [49]. Because physical, psychological, and social context can influence cognitive performance and perceptions, our team examined the specific dynamics of these relationships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in a historically disadvantaged population.

This study examined how anxiety and stress perceptions moderate the relationship between perceived cognitive changes and objectively measured cognition in older B/AA adults. We evaluated associations between subjective and objective mental functioning with the expectation that these measures would be highly correlated. Next, we examined the impact of anxiety on measures of cognition. We hypothesized that anxiety levels would moderate the relationship between subjective and objective cognitive measures. Higher anxiety would be associated with more substantial discrepancies between elevated subjective burdens relative to objective cognitive measures. Lastly, we measured the relationship between perceived stress and cognitive measures. We expected higher perceived stress to be associated with an elevated level of perceived cognitive difficulties relative to actual cognitive performance.

METHODS

Participants and Procedure

We administered telephone screenings to 206 older B/AA adults (aged 64 – 94 years) during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (from July 28, 2020, through the reopening of our lab on July 16, 2021). Our recruitment source was the Healthier Black Elders Center (HBEC) research registry, a community-based participatory research initiative from the Michigan Center for Urban African American Aging Research (a Resource Center for Minority Aging Research) located at Wayne State University’s Institute of Gerontology and sponsored by the National Institutes of Health [50]. Participants were eligible for participation if they were fluent English-language speakers, self-identified as Black or African American, and were at least 64 years old. We excluded participants with unstable telephone connections or profound hearing impairment. We assessed hearing status by asking participants to repeat a phrase accurately. Verbal assent for survey participation was obtained, and this study was conducted with the approval of the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board.

We used telephone surveys as a screening step to determine eligibility for a more extensive study. We recruited potential participants through a research registry and referrals from existing participants. Each survey took approximately 45–60 minutes to complete. Of the 482 participants contacted, 230 agreed to complete the survey, and 206 had complete data for the variables included in the primary analysis.

Materials and Instruments

Survey questions were designed and implemented by an international team of researchers in China, Slovenia, and the United States with the purpose of better understanding the variety of pandemic responses and experiences of participants in different environments [51]. The final survey included several core measures which were common to all sites, as well as additional site-specific items. The instrument battery captured many aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including perceptions of stress, cognitive performance, personal experiences with COVID-19, general health status, emotions, anxiety, and vaccination beliefs. The analyses reported here include only data collected in the United States from a sample of B/AA participants from Wayne State University’s HBEC. We present only the subset of survey instruments relevant to our research questions.

Subjective Assessment of Cognitive Functioning - Change Questionnaire (CCQ)

We implemented the cognitive change questionnaire (CCQ) to measure subjective cognitive performance [51]. The CCQ includes nine items to measure perceived changes in current cognitive functioning compared to before the pandemic. We quantified responses on a 7-point scale (1 – much less often or much easier than before, through 7– much more frequently or more challenging than before). We designed items to assess subjective decline in processing speed, attention, working memory, executive control, and memory. Higher scores indicated more subjective cognitive impairment.

Objective Cognitive Performance - Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-m)

To assess objective cognitive performance, we used the TICS-m [52]. This 22-item instrument measures global cognition with questions about orientation, immediate and delayed recall, and executive function. TICS-m is a modified version of the more extended original TICS instrument [53]. Using a score below 32 as a cut point, TICS-m scores are both sensitive (82.4%) and specific (87.0%) to the identification of MCI [54]. Possible scores ranged from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance. A score below 32 was indicative of clinically significant cognitive impairment.

Anxiety - Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7)

We measured anxiety using the GAD-7 [55]. The GAD-7 is widely used as a screening instrument to detect self-reported anxiety. The GAD-7 includes seven items measured with responses on a four-point scale (ranging from never to nearly every day). It has demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s 𝛂 =.88–89; [51, 56]). Higher scores indicate that participants experience anxiety more frequently. In clinical settings, scores of 5, 10, and 15 indicate mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively, with scores of 10 or higher serving as a widely used screening cutpoint [57].

Stress Perceptions - Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4)

We evaluated perceived stress with the four-item PSS-4 [58]. The PSS-4 is a brief adaptation of the original self-report instrument [59]. Although it contains few items, PSS-4 scores show adequate reliability in previous studies (Cronbach’s 𝛂=.60–.75; [51, 60, 61]). The PSS-4 measures generalized stress and a sense of control over self-appraised important features in life. Participants endorse each item with a rating between 1 – never, and 5 – very often. Higher scores indicate elevated perceived stress or that perceived demands exceed perceived coping ability [58].

Demographics

Participants reported their sex, age, years of education, current occupation, residence type, number of household residents, and general perceived health status.

Data Analysis

We examined each variable’s central tendency and distribution measures (Table 1). We computed Welch’s t tests and ANOVAs (Table 1) to compare metacognition discrepancy indices across subsamples based on self-reported health status and demographic groups (sex, age, education, occupation, household members). We also calculated scale reliabilities and descriptive statistics for each study variable (Table 2). Because of the ordinal nature of the CCQ item response options, we computed polychoric correlations using principal components analysis to evaluate the component structure of the CCQ instrument [62]. We tested hypotheses using linear and multiple regression and correlation with an alpha level of .05. To quantify the magnitude and direction of metacognition discrepancies, we measured the mismatch between subjective and objective cognitive measures as the standardized residual variance in the regression of TICS-m to CCQ-e. We, therefore, renamed this standardized residual a Metacognition Discrepancy Index (MDI). Negative MDI resulted from more observed impairment than expected from the level of subjective complaints; positive MDI was recorded when less objective impairment was observed than expected from subjective complaints. We analyzed data with IBM SPSS Statistics, version 28, and Stata, version 16.1 [63].

RESULTS

Demographics

Table 1 displays complete demographic data for the final sample. Participants were primarily female (91%). Participants’ ages ranged from 64 to 94 years (M=75.4, SD=7.2). Most had received at least some university education (years of education ranged from 12–20). Participants were generally retired from formal employment (80.6%), but 14.5% maintained an actively employed job status. Household composition and residence type varied. Most participants lived alone (60.2%) and in single-family, detached dwellings (63%), although some lived in households of up to 9 individuals. Generally, participants rated their health status as “good” (56%).

CCQ Latent Variable Analysis

In this sample, we identified two components within the CCQ. The first five items with “easier/harder” responses reflected working memory, and the remaining four described executive function (CCQ-e). Because the first principal component of the CCQ-e explained 68.8% of the variance with an eigenvalue of 2.75, these component scores were retained to represent the subjective cognitive status variable in all further analyses.

Anxiety and Cognition

To evaluate the role of anxiety in subjective cognitive complaints, we tested GAD-7 as a moderator of the TICS-m and CCQ-e relationship. The interaction between GAD-7 and TICS-m did not demonstrate a significant moderating effect on the linear relationship between TICS-m and CCQ-e (see Table 2, b=.005, SE=.003, p=.10). However, GAD-7 scores correlated moderately with the MDI (r(197) =.40, p&lt;.001; Figure 1, panel A).

Perceived Stress and Cognition

We examined perceived stress as a potential moderator of the relation between subjective and objective cognitive measures. There was no interaction effect between the PSS-4 total score and the TICS-m (see Table 2; b=0.01, SE=0.01, p=0.16), indicating that PSS-4 scores did not moderate the linear relationship between TICS-m and CCQ-e. In contrast, the PSS-4 and the MDI were moderately correlated (r(197) =.33, p&lt;.001; Figure 1, panel B).

Group differences

Table 1 illustrates comparisons in average discrepancy scores and tests for group differences. We found no significant group differences in average MDI between sexes or employment status using t tests and no significant differences in average MDI between individuals living alone, with a partner, or with others using ANOVA. Years of age, education, and MDI were uncorrelated. Individuals reporting different perceived health statuses reflected the only group differences in mean MDI (F(3, 195)=3.89, p=.01). Those who acknowledged “Fair” health had the highest average MDI (M=0.32, SD=1.11), and those endorsing “Excellent” health had the most negative MDI (M=−0.39, SD=0.41).

DISCUSSION

No significant stress or anxiety moderation effect influenced the relationship between subjective and objective cognitive measures. Our analyses suggest that, although not wholly explanatory, subjective and objective measures of cognition are related. The discrepancy between subjectively and objectively measured cognitive performance is related to anxiety and perceived stress, such that increases in these affective experiences occur alongside increased perceived cognitive difficulty beyond expectation based on objective cognitive performance. There were no observable differences in MDI between any of the examined subgroups except for individuals with differences in perceived health status. Participants who reported “Fair” health demonstrated the highest MDI, and those that reported “Excellent” health status showed the most negative MDI.

Metacognition: Subjective Complaints and Objective Measures

Considering the direction of metacognitive discrepancy could provide clinically meaningful information beyond what can be independently ascertained through symptom reports or cognitive tests. An MDI of zero indicates a perfect agreement between objective and subjective cognitive measures. A positive discrepancy corresponds to an excess of subjective cognitive complaints relative to what would be expected based on objective criteria, not unlike SCD. In contrast, a negative MDI describes a state similar to anosognosia in which an individual’s subjective report does not acknowledge measured cognitive impairments.

Previous studies of subjective and objective cognitive measures in older adults report inconsistent findings. Diverse populations have often been excluded from cognitive aging research and studies of metacognition [24, 27]. In a study of a diverse sample, Jackson and colleagues [24] observed different patterns of inaccurate metacognition across racial groups. Although all older adult participants reported similar levels of cognitive concerns, non-Hispanic white participants’ self-reported cognitive concerns were significantly related to poorer measurements of objective performance. In contrast, no similar associations were found among B/AA participants. These differential findings were attributed to differences in culture or lifestyle factors. Some evidence also suggests that the reliability of subjective reports in predicting objective performance may be compromised in older adults with MCI compared to normal cognition [64], which further complicates assessment efforts in this subset of the population with significant needs for accurate results. Across all samples, statistically detectable associations between subjective ratings and cognitive performance are weak and explain only a small portion of variance by this relationship alone [4, 5, 22, 24, 65]. The remaining variance must be attributable to other physical, psychological, or social factors. This study further explored two possible psychological factors, anxiety and stress.

Metacognition and Psychological Factors

Anxiety represents a psychological burden that may interrupt the process of cognitive self-evaluation and reporting. Previous studies of the relationships between anxiety and the closely related concepts of worry and negative affect have consistently demonstrated the detrimental effect of these emotional processes on subjective, self-reported cognitive status [1, 7, 9, 23]. However, previous studies have not explained the influences of psychological burdens on metacognition to contextualize the nature of cognitive complaints within objective cognitive performance. Other samples have failed to support a relationship between anxiety and subjective complaints when studied across all age groups [51].

Similarly, stress impacts both subjective and objective functions. In its acute and chronic stages, stress affects cognitive functions such as planning, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility [66, 67]. The combination of daily and pandemic-related stressors may also promote subjective cognitive impairment in samples of older and younger adults [51, 68].

The mechanisms underlying the relationships between anxiety or stress and metacognition are not known. In situations with measurable cognitive decline, physical neurodegeneration, chronic health conditions, or physiological aging processes may explain some metacognition discrepancies arising from objective reductions in cognitive performance [69, 70,71]. In these scenarios, individuals’ perceptions of cognitive decline may be denied or repressed due to fears about AD [29]. This position is congruent with our finding of group differences in perceived health status: those who already perceived poorer overall health reported more significant cognitive difficulties than expected for their objective performance. In contrast, those who perceived having an optimal health status acknowledged fewer cognitive complaints than expected from their actual performance.

In other cases, psychological and social phenomena may influence metacognition by causing increased vigilance and sensitivity to expected age-related changes, motivating an increased utilization of memory care evaluations and a higher likelihood of receiving a diagnosis of MCI or AD [9]. Both objective and subjective cognition could be at risk for decline during heightened stress or anxiety. These stressful circumstances may divert already limited cognitive resources for processing stress- and anxiety-related thoughts and emotions, reducing the ability to allocate cognitive capacity to the performance of cognitive tasks or accurate metacognitive evaluation [71].

Metacognition and Contextual Factors

In a COVID-19 telephone outreach initiative conducted by the HBEC, our target population expressed their experiences with issues such as grief, difficulty obtaining necessities through reduced in-person shopping outings, and confusion about COVID-19 [73]. Many participants also expressed a need for further information or specific resources [73]. Considering the likely combination of the acute stress of the pandemic and the chronic stress of structural racism within this particular population [18, 46, 47, 48, 49], the magnitude of perceived stress was surprisingly low in this survey. The extent to which practical stress-related coping skills support accurate metacognition remains unknown. Further, although this study did not measure COVID-19 exposure or recovery, accumulating evidence demonstrates the physical risks to subjective and objective cognition related to SARS-CoV-2 infection [41, 42, 43, 44].

Limitations

The cross-sectional sample of participants limits the extent to which conclusions can be drawn about the long-term clinical utility of the MDI over time. We collected data remotely with telephone interviews, which may threaten the reliability of the measures compared to better-validated, traditional, pencil-and-paper cognitive evaluation. However, when considering both the physical risks and sequelae of COVID-19 and the technological limitations of older adults with limited financial means, telephone contact was the most ethically responsible and inclusive communication during the pandemic [73].

Our study focused only on older B/AA participants from a single urban metropolitan area, which limits the ability to draw comparisons with other groups and may limit the generalizability of these findings to other populations. Further, the sample included primarily women (91%), another limitation to the generalizability of these findings. Participants in this study were volunteers, and the risk of self-selection bias is possible. In studies where recruitment is not population-based, altruism or volunteerism can further complicate bias. In a study of aging and cognition (Ganguli et al., 1998).[74], In comparison to randomly selected participants, volunteers were significantly more likely to be women, more educated, demonstrate higher cognitive performance, and have fewer Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) impairments. Participants in this non-randomly selected sample may be similarly differentiated from the general population. In addition, several studies using cognitive tasks have shown gender differences in metacognition, demonstrating that relative to women, men generally underestimated their performance (Hertzog et al., 1990) [75] [76]. However, females have been more precise in questioning the author’s credibility and the source of the article they read than the male participants (Srinivasan, 2005) [77]. Future research should further explore the potential effects of selection bias related to investigations of the association between subjective and objective measures of cognition.

Lastly, additional contextual covariates, such as depression [4, 10, 29], comorbid health conditions, or formal dementia diagnosis, were not measured in these analyses. Other unmeasured determinates of the relationship between subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive status may exist.

Notably, general SCD is not always indicative of disease-related neurodegenerative processes. In many cases, SCD may reflect expected age-related changes or the harmful cognitive effects of chronic health conditions rather than impending AD [69, 70]. Considering the potential etiologies of SCD and the limited reliability of self-reported cognition, it is essential to emphasize that a subjective cognitive complaint does not always indicate preclinical AD.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that subjective and objective measures of cognitive status are related and that metacognition discrepancy has clinically relevant interpretations. The MDI, which anchors subjective cognitive symptoms in the context of objectively measured cognitive performance, may provide more comprehensive insights into the individual’s experience than either subjective or objective reports measured independently. Furthermore, metacognition discrepancies relate to affective experiences such as anxiety and perceived stress. These findings also have several practical implications. First, while subjective and objective measures are critical data sources linked to an individual’s cognitive capacity, subjective complaints are more uniformly interpretable when subjective complaints are anchored within the context of objectively measured cognitive performance. Second, during experiences of heightened anxiety or stress, an overestimation of cognitive difficulties relative to actual capability is likely. Future studies may extend these findings by investigating the potential for focused interventions to reduce anxiety and stress, which may, in turn, reduce metacognition discrepancies. Further testing of such interventions in persons with different cognitive diagnoses or psychosocial backgrounds may also help realign subjective and objective perceptions. Clinical diagnosis and future research should also consider the association between subjective and objective cognitive decline within the context of neural, psychological, and social factors.
