Objective:

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement invariance of a neuropsychological battery across race/ethnicity by sex/gender subgroups over repeated measurements.

Method:

Participants were 6,057 non-Hispanic White (NHW), Black, and Hispanic men and women in the Washington/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) who were administered neuropsychological tests of memory, language, and visuospatial abilities at 18 to 24-month intervals for up to 25 years. Invariance analyses were conducted on the three-factor model across sex/gender, racial/ethnic, and sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups, as well as across five assessment timepoints.

Results:

The three-factor model demonstrated full measurement invariance across sex/gender groups and over repeated measurements. However, partial measurement invariance (invariant factor structure and factor loadings but nonequivalent observed score intercepts) for the language domain was exhibited across racial/ethnic and sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups.

Conclusion:

Establishing measurement invariance essential for valid interpretation of group differences in cognitive test performance. Findings from the current study highlight the need for continued examination of sex/gender by racial/ethnic differences in measurement properties of assessment tools, as well as expanded research on sex/gender variability across other understudied racial/ethnic groups.

neuropsychology

Neuropsychological assessment provides critical information about the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other dementias and is an essential component of longitudinal research aimed at understanding disparities in dementia. Older Hispanics and older non-Hispanic Blacks are more likely than older Non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) to have AD (Evans et al., 2003; Gurland et al., 1998; Haerer, Anderson, &amp; Schoenberg, 1987; Mayeda, Glymour, Quesenberry, &amp; Whitmer; Perkins et al., 1997; Potter et al., 2009; Prineas et al., 1995; Samper-Ternent et al., 2012; Tang, Cross, Andrews, Jacobs, Small, Bell, Merchant, et al., 2001; Tang et al., 1998; Whitmer, 2014; Yaffe et al., 2013). Women account for nearly two-thirds of the 5.3 million individuals aged 65 years and older with AD in the United States (Hebert, Weuve, Scherr, &amp; Evans, 2013). It is important for neuropsychological measures to have comparable measurement across racial/ethnic and sex/gender groups in order to make valid interpretations of demographic differences in cognitive aging.

Neuropsychological measures used to diagnose dementia have been developed and validated with primarily US-born, highly educated, monolingual English speaking NHWs. An overwhelming amount of literature suggests that cognitive test performance is influenced by a myriad of socio-cultural factors including acculturation level, quality of education, socio-economic status, and English language proficiency (see reviews in Ferraro, 2016). When criterion measures are vulnerable to socio-cultural factors, the potential for measurement validity issues increases. Failure to account for potential measurement issues can lead to inaccurate classification of cognitive impairment and, ultimately, hinder efforts to eliminate age-related cognitive health disparities.

Measurement invariance (i.e., equivalence) is an essential component of neuropsychological research examining group differences. Measurement invariance is observed when measures of interest represent the same theoretical constructs under different conditions (Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992). Different conditions may include groups and/or time of measurement. In the context of measurement invariance, researchers can examine whether neuropsychological tests measure the same cognitive constructs (equal factor structure), demonstrate equivalent relationships to hypothesized constructs across different subpopulations or contexts (equal factor loadings), and whether observed scores differ between subpopulations or contexts at equivalent levels of underlying cognitive abilities (equal intercepts) (Brown, 2015). Such analyses are typically conducted via multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), whereby the CFA model represents a measurement model with observed indicator scores (e.g., scores on individual measures of memory) that are regressed on scores of the latent, unobserved construct (e.g., memory ability) (Wicherts &amp; Dolan, 2010). The measurement model includes a factor loading, intercept, and residual term for each observed indicator and models are simultaneously estimated for each group and/or time point. Multiple-group CFA allows all aspects of measurement invariance to be examined by testing increasingly restrictive hypotheses to determine whether the relationship between test scores and latent constructs is independent of or dependent on group membership/time. This relationship must be independent to make meaningful comparisons of latent mean differences (Wicherts, 2016). It is important to note there is variability in terminology for various tests of invariance (Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000), which will be reviewed briefly here.

Configural invariance is the most basic form of invariance and concerns whether all groups or measurement occasions have the same factor structure (Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992). For example, configural invariance asks whether individual tests of memory ability represent the cognitive construct of memory in the same way across different groups or across time-points. Configural invariance is tested by constraining the measurement model to be equal across groups while allowing all parameters (factor loadings, intercepts) to be freely estimated within groups (Kline, 2011). If configural invariance is established, then the cognitive construct (i.e., memory) can be conceptualized in the same way across groups and/or time (Meitinger, 2017). However, since factor loadings are allowed to freely vary in this model it is still possible that individuals responded to items on each memory tests differently.

Metric invariance, or weak invariance (Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992), examines differential responding to items by testing whether the strengths of the relationships between, for example, specific measures of memory and the memory construct are the same across groups/time. This is done by adding an additional restriction to the previous configural model to constrain the unstandardized factor loadings of each indicator to be equal across groups/time. If the metric model does not fit worse than the configural model, then it is assumed that item indicators are related to latent factors in the same way across groups/time. While a necessary step to make group comparisons, establishing metric invariance is not sufficient to compare (latent) mean values across groups/time (Wicherts &amp; Dolan, 2010), which is often of main interest to researchers.

Scalar invariance (i.e., strong invariance) examines whether any group differences in observed scores on individual measures are due to group differences at the latent level or factor mean (Meitinger, 2017). For example, this model assumes that at the same level of latent memory ability, individuals will be at the same level (i.e., intercept) of each memory test. Building from the metric invariance model, another restriction is added by constraining intercepts of the observed variables to be the same across groups/time (Widaman &amp; Reise, 1997). If the scalar model does not fit worse than the metric model, then it is assumed that test performance is the same, at the same level of the latent factor, across groups/time. If scalar invariance fails for a particular measure, then observed group differences on that measure cannot be explained by the latent cognitive ability that the measure is intended to represent (Wicherts, 2016). When more than half of the intercepts on a factor fail scalar invariance, then the actual group differences in the factor (e.g., mean differences in memory ability) are not correctly reflected in group differences on the observed indicators. Failure to meet scalar invariance indicates that other, construct-irrelevant factors are affecting test performance differently across groups/time and comparisons of latent means are ill-advised. Potential construct-irrelevant factors include linguistic, education, and socio-cultural differences between groups, as well as issues related to familiarity with testing and/or test content, and test-taking strategies (Wicherts &amp; Dolan, 2010).

Residual invariance (i.e., strict invariance) is the most restrictive level of invariance and requires equal factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances. This type of invariance is considered overly restrictive, but is useful if determining the reliability of a measure is invariant across groups (Bryne, 2004). Finally, structural measurement invariance can be examined through group comparisons on factor variances, covariances, and means. Examination of structural parameters determines whether groups differ in their average levels of the underlying construct and whether the amount of within-group variability of a latent construct differs across groups (Brown, 2015).

Previous studies examining measurement invariance across sex/gender groups have demonstrated scalar invariance between men and women on a range of cognitive abilities (i.e., verbal memory, visuospatial memory, processing speed, attention/concentration, crystallized and fluid intelligence) (Blankson &amp; McArdle, 2013; Maitland, Intrieri, Schaie, &amp; Willis, 2000). Research across racial/ethnic groups has been mixed, with some studies finding scalar invariance (Barnes et al., 2016; Blankson &amp; McArdle, 2013; Dolan, 2000) and others only demonstrating partial metric or partial scalar invariance on measures of memory and/or language abilities (Dolan, Roorda, &amp; Wicherts, 2004; Mungas, Widaman, Reed, &amp; Farias, 2011; Wicherts &amp; Dolan, 2010). The few studies that have examined measurement invariance across race/ethnicity and/or sex/gender and repeated assessments have done so by examining each aspect separately. This approach ignores important differences in socio-cultural experiences across racial/ethnic by sex/gender subgroups (e.g., Black women vs. NHW women) that may differently affect test performance and assumes that measures are invariant across women or men of different racial/ethnic groups. However, if this assumption of invariance is incorrect and not explicitly tested, then interpretation of group differences in neuropsychological test performance between racial/ethnic by sex/gender subgroups are likely to be inaccurate (Blankson &amp; McArdle, 2013). Little is known about measurement invariance of neuropsychological measures across race/ethnicity by sex/gender subgroups. Establishing measurement invariance across race/ethnicity and sex/gender subgroups would enable researchers to look at interactions between sex/gender and race/ethnicity on cognitive trajectories.

Several studies have found scalar invariance across multiple measurement occasions (Blankson &amp; McArdle, 2013; Williams, Chandola, &amp; Pendleton, 2018), yet few have examined factor structure stability across repeated assessments in specific sex/gender (Maitland et al., 2000) and/or racial/ethnic groups (Barnes et al., 2016). Given that the aforementioned literature demonstrated measurement invariance within sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups, it is likely that factor structure stability will also be demonstrated within sex/gender by racial/ethnic groups. However, when examining longitudinal invariance in samples age 65 years and older, issues related to dedifferentiation of cognitive abilities (i.e., cognitive/sensory abilities become simplified and less distinct in old age) question the viability of such assumptions (Baltes &amp; Lindenberger, 1997). Moreover, practice effects may also lead to an overestimation of cognitive test performance at follow-up visits (Wicherts &amp; Dolan, 2010). If measurement invariance fails due to factors affecting measurement invariance across time, such as practice effects or change in cognitive and/or sensory impairment (Williams et al., 2018), functioning differently across subgroups, then any group differences in rate of cognitive change are not interpretable. Thus, examination of measurement invariance over multiple assessments is an essential first step to examining group differences in cognitive trajectories.

The problem with utilizing non-invariant neuropsychological measures is that differences in test scores are mistakenly associated with differences in actual cognitive abilities. It is often simply assumed that neuropsychological tests are similarly invariant across different demographic groups, as well as across assessment time points. Yet, very few longitudinal studies in cognitive aging with diverse populations have tested measurement invariance. In order to move AD disparities research forward, it is imperative to determine the comparability of neuropsychological test scores among those most at risk for AD.

The Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP) is a community-based longitudinal aging study that has produced extensive data regarding prevalence rates and risk factors associated with AD and other dementias among Black, Hispanic, and NHW elderly, urban-dwelling residents of Northern Manhattan communities. Cognitive functioning in WHICAP was assessed via a comprehensive neuropsychological battery comprised of measures of memory, language, visuospatial functioning, and processing speed (see Stern et al., 1992, for details on battery development). Siedlecki et al. (2010) examined measurement invariance across the English and Spanish versions of the WHICAP battery and demonstrated partial scalar invariance, with at least one non-invariant intercept on each cognitive domain. When post-hoc invariance analyses were conducted across education-matched subsamples of English and Spanish speakers, only one intercept on the language domain and two intercepts on the visuo-spatial domain were non-invariant. These findings suggest that while intercept differences can be partially accounted for by differences in educational attainment, some measures may be biased with respect to language of administration. It is unclear whether the WHICAP battery measures the same constructs across sex/gender and racial/ethnic groups, as well as across assessment time points.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement invariance of a neuropsychological battery across race/ethnicity by sex/gender groups over time. Based on previous literature, we hypothesized the battery would demonstrate configural and metric invariance over repeated measurements, as well as across sex/gender, racial/ethnic, and sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups. We also expect that the battery will demonstrate scalar invariance across men and women; however, due to socio-cultural heterogeneity between racial/ethnic groups, we hypothesize that scalar invariance will not be fully demonstrated across racial/ethnic and sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups. Further, we hypothesize that only partial scalar invariance will be met across repeated measurements due to practice effects for earlier assessment periods and potential dedifferentiation of cognitive abilities at later assessment periods.

Method

Participants

Participants in WHICAP were community-living Medicare recipients 65 years and older recruited from northern Manhattan (Tang, Cross, Andrews, Jacobs, Small, Bell, &amp; Mayeux, 2001). Potential participants were identified based on residence in U.S. census tracts within the study catchment area. Recruitment occurred in three waves: 1992 (N = 2,126), 1999 (N = 2,174) and 2009 (N = 2,128). Participants invited to participate completed an initial assessment session and were followed up at approximately 18 to 24-month intervals for up to 25 years. During each session, participants were administered a battery of neuropsychological measures and asked an extensive set of questions about their general health, functional ability, and medical history. Self-reported race/ethnicity was classified based on the 1990 US Census guidelines. Participants were first asked whether they were Hispanic or Latino and then asked to classify themselves as White, Black, Asian, American Indian, Pacific Islander, or other. Evaluations were conducted in English or Spanish, based on the participant’s language of preference. This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, Columbia University Health Sciences, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Of the 6,428 participating individuals, 6,163 completed neuropsychological testing. Participants who self-reported a primary race/ethnicity other than NHW, Black, or Hispanic (N=86) and those missing data on years of education (N=20) were excluded from the current analyses. The remaining sample included a total of 6,057 NHW male (n=554), NHW female (n=876), Black male (n=549), Black female (n=1,332), Hispanic male (n=834), and Hispanic female (n=1,912) participants. Approximately 60% of the participants were administered study protocols, including neuropsychological measures, in English. Spanish was the preferred language of administration for 94% of the Hispanic participants.

Diagnosis of all-cause dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was determined via consensus case conference based on neurological, neuropsychological, functional, medical, and psychiatric data collected from participants and/or informants, and followed standard research criteria for all-cause dementia (Manly et al., 2008; McKhann et al., 2011). Follow-up diagnoses were made blind to prior diagnoses. Estimated MCI prevalence at baseline was 15.0% in Black women, 16.6% in Black men, 16.9% in NHW men, 17.0% in NHW women, 17.9% in Hispanic men, and 18.8% in Hispanic women. Dementia prevalence at baseline was 4.0% in NHW men, 6.8% in NHW women, 11.7% in Black men, 14.6% in Black women,13.9% in Hispanic men, and 15.6% in Hispanic women.

Approximately half of each group was lost to follow-up before their third visit and between 77% and 86% of each group was lost to follow-up before their fifth visit. Of those lost to follow-up, 26% to 46% were lost to follow-up due to death (Figure 2). Follow-up data in the current study was limited to five study visits due to low sample sizes after the 5th visit across sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups.

Neuropsychological Assessment

Selective Reminding Test (SRT; Buschke &amp; Fuld, 1974).

In this word recall measure, participants were read a list of 12 words over six trials and asked to recall as many words as possible after each trial. The SRT Total score was calculated as the total number of words correctly recalled after all six trials. The SRT Delayed Recall score refers to the number of words correctly recalled after a 15-minute delay. Participants were also administered a delayed recognition test in which they were asked to recognize each of the 12 words among three distracter words. The SRT Delayed Recognition score was calculated by the difference between number of words correctly recalled and number of words correctly recognized divided by number of recognition items administered. Three alternate forms of the SRT, with word lists matched on frequency and length, were administered over repeated measurement occasions.

Boston Naming Test, Modified 15-Item (BNT; Kaplan, Goodglass, &amp; Weintraub, 1983).

Participants were presented with 15 line drawings of objects and asked to identify each. Participants were provided with a semantic cue if they are unable to name the object 20 seconds after it is presented to them. Phonemic cues were provided if the participant was unable to name the object 15 seconds after a semantic cue was presented. The Naming Total score refers to the total number of objects spontaneously named (i.e., without cueing).

Verbal Fluency.

For the letter fluency portion of this test, participants were given one of three letters at a time (i.e., C, F, L) and asked to generate as many words as possible that begin with each letter in one minute. Participants administered this test in English were asked to generate words beginning with the letters C, F, and L, while those administered in Spanish were asked to generate words beginning with the letters P, S, and V. Letters used in the English and Spanish versions were comparable in mean frequency rank (for details, see Jacobs, Sano, Albert, Schofield, Dooneief, &amp; Stern, 1997). The Letter Fluency score refers to the total number of words generated across the three letters. For the category fluency portion, participants were presented with a category (e.g., animals) and asked to spontaneously generate as many semantically related words as possible within one minute. The Category Fluency score refers to the total number of words generated across categories (Siedlecki et al., 2010).

Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Similarities subtest (WAIS-R; Wechsler, 1987).

Participants were presented with two words at a time and asked to describe how the two sets of words were similar. The Similarities variable refers to the total number of points obtained on this task.

Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT; Benton, 1955).

This test was comprised of two parts. In the first part, participants were presented with a design for 10 seconds and then asked to select the design among three distracters. The BVRT Recognition score refers to the total number of designs correctly recognized. The second part of the test asks participants to match each of the previously learned designs to identical designs among four smaller designs. The total number of designs correctly matched is quantified as the BVRT Matching score.

Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Evaluation, Repetition subtest (BDAE; Goodglass, 1983).

Participants were asked to read phrases that were read to them by an examiner. The Repetition variable refers to the total number of phrases correctly repeated.

Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Evaluation, Comprehension subtest (BDAE; Goodglass, 1983).

Participants were asked basic comprehension questions and the number of questions correctly answered was recorded.

Rosen Drawing Test (Rosen, 1981).

Participants were presented with five different designs and asked to copy each on a piece of paper. The total number of correctly copied designs was quantified as the Rosen variable.

Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, Identities and Oddities subtest (Mattis, 1976).

Participants were presented with three items at a time over eight trails. For each trial, participants were asked to select two of the three items that are similar to each other. Participants were then administered another eight trials of the same items and asked to select which of the three items is different from the other items. The Identities &amp; Oddities variable refers to the total number of correct items across trials.

Descriptive statistics for the neuropsychological measures are provided in Table 2. Preliminary analysis of the selected neuropsychological measures used in this study found no violations related to multivariate outliers, variable distributions, and their intercorrelations across groups.

Statistical Analyses

Basic dimensional structure.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was used to evaluate the dimensional structure of the WHICAP neuropsychological battery. The original WHICAP factor structure described in Siedlecki et al. (2010) summarized 15 WHICAP measures into four cognitive domains: Memory, Language, Visuospatial Functioning, and Processing Speed. Of note, the sample in this previous study only included WHICAP participants in the 1992 cohort who were non-demented at their baseline visit.

Memory was represented by total recall, delayed recall, and delayed recognition from the SRT. Language abilities were measured by naming total, category and letter fluency, and WAIS-R similarities subtest. The BDAE repetition and comprehension subtests were initially included in the model as part of the language factor; however, both measures demonstrated poor psychometric properties and standardized factor loadings below 0.40. While several correlation residuals exceeded the recommended cut-off of 0.10 (Kline, 2011), the highest was between category and letter fluency (0.54). Considering that these variables have similar administration and response formats, they likely have shared variance that may not represent meaningful variance of the underlying latent variable, in this case language (Mungas et al., 2011). Correlations among the two measures were accommodated with methods correlations, which improved model fit by relaxing the conditional independence assumption. Of note, the inclusion of this methods correlation was not done to improve fit of a poor fitting model, as fit for the model excluding the residual correlation was adequate (χ2 [41] = 920.40, p &lt;0.001; CFI=0.970, TLI=0.961, RMSEA=0.068 [90% CI 0.064, 0.071]). Methods correlations between category and letter fluency have been included in previous measurement invariance analyses (Park et al., 2012; Tuokko et al., 2009). All analyses reported in the current paper were re-estimated without the residual correlation and substantive interpretations were unchanged. The visuospatial factor was comprised of the BVRT recognition and matching subtests, the Rosen Drawing Test, and the Identities and Oddities subtest. Participants from the 1992 recruitment cohort were not administered measures of processing speed at their baseline assessment; as a result, the Processing Speed factor was not included in the current hypothesized factor structure. A model diagram for the hypothesized factor structure is provided in Figure 1.

Invariance of model across groups.

Multiple-group CFA was used to test whether the model measured the same constructs across race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and race/ethnicity by sex/gender groups. Configural invariance was assessed by examining the overall fit of the model when model structure is constrained to be equal across groups, but indicator factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances are freely estimated for each group. Metric invariance was assessed by adding an additional model constraint of equivalent loadings, of the same indicators, across groups for all indicators. The metric model fit was compared to the configural model fit to determine whether there was a significant decrement in model fit with the additional model constraint. Scalar invariance was then evaluated by adding an additional model constraint of equivalent item intercepts across groups for all indicators. Invariance across structural parameters was examined by constraining factor variances and covariances. Measurement invariance was first assessed across racial/ethnic groups, followed by sex/gender groups, then racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups.

To examine measurement invariance across time, we used a single-group longitudinal CFA framework that allowed residual correlations for the same indicators that were measured at different occasions, taking into account the longitudinal nature of the data (Fokkema, Smits, Kelderman, &amp; Cuijpers, 2013). Attempts were made to fit the three-factor model across five time points simultaneously, however, results were inadmissible with non-positive definite estimated matrices due to estimated factor correlations across time being greater than 1.0. As a result, several longitudinal analyses were conducted comparing baseline to the subsequent timepoints (e.g., baseline vs. time 2, baseline vs. time 3, etc.,) in each racial/ethnic group by sex/gender group individually.

Model estimation was performed with Mplus version 7.4 (Muthen &amp; Muthen, 1998-2011) using a maximum likelihood estimator for continuous variables applied to a mean and covariance data structure. Goodness of fit indices were used to assess model fit and to compare the fit of each constrained model to the previous model. Overall chi-square was evaluated; however, given the large difference in group size, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; Browne &amp; Cudeck; Steiger &amp; Lind, 1980) and Comparative Fit Index (CFI; Bentler, 1990) were primarily used for assessment of acceptable model fit. Model fit was determined as having acceptable fit if RMSEA values were less than 0.10 and CFI values greater than 0.90 (Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999; MacCallum, Browne, &amp; Sugawara, 1996). Change in CFI and RMSEA were used to interpret whether the fit of the models was significantly different, with change in CFI equal to or less than −.01 and change in RMSEA less than 0.015 indicating that the invariance hypothesis should not be rejected (Chen, 2007).

Results

Demographic Characteristics

Demographics are presented in Table 1. Female participants were older and completed fewer years of education compared to their male counterparts. The NHW participants had the highest level of educational attainment followed by the Black participants and then Hispanic participants. While NHW and Hispanic men had higher levels of educational attainment compared to their NHW and Hispanic female counterparts, Black women completed more years of education compared with Black men.

Initial CFA

Results for the entire sample indicated good model fit (χ2 [40] = 874.65, p &lt;0.001; CFI=0.975, TLI=0.965, RMSEA=0.059 [90% CI 0.055, 0.062], SRMR=0.035). Standardized factor loadings were above 0.40 for all measures. Indicator variables varied in their strength of factor loadings, with the strongest factor loadings for SRT immediate recall (0.95), phonemic fluency (0.82), Benton recognition (0.82) and Similarities (0.82) and the weakest loadings for identities/oddities (0.60) and SRT delayed recognition (0.61). Residual misfit was noted based on correlation residuals exceeding 0.10 (Kline, 2011), with a correlation residual of −0.290 for Benton matching with SRT delayed recall; however, average residual correlation was acceptable based on the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR = 0.036). Factor correlations ranged from .687 to .877 with the strongest correlation between the language and visuospatial factors and lowest between the visuospatial and memory factors.

Model fit was good across each racial/ethnic group, sex/gender group, and race/ethnicity by sex/gender group, with RMSEAs of 0.042 to 0.062 and CFIs of .951 to .978. Model fit indices by groups are presented in Table 2.

Measurement Invariance Across Groups

Sex/Gender.

The configural model fit well across sex/gender groups (χ2 [80] = 900.58, p&lt;.001, RMSEA = 0.058 [90% CI = 0.055-0.062], and CFI = 0.974). Examination of goodness of fit indices indicated that the data fit full scalar invariance, with no substantial changes in model fit when models became more restricted. Additionally, full structural invariance was obtained between men and women. Results from the analyses across sex/gender groups are presented in Table 3.

Racial/Ethnic.

Across racial/ethnic groups, the configural model fit well (χ2 [120] = 865.74, p &lt;.001, RMSEA = 0.055 [90% CI = 0.052-0.059], and CFI = 0.973) (Table 4). Change in model fit was substantial when comparing the metric and scalar models (Δ CFI = −0.020). Evaluation of fit indices for each variable intercept when constrained separately indicated that the largest reductions in fit were associated with the constraints on the Naming Total indicator for the NHW and Hispanic groups and the Similarities indicator for the NHW group. When the Naming Total and Similarities intercept was unconstrained in the respective groups change in model fit was no longer substantial (Δ CFI = −0.006, Δ RMSEA = 0.003). Regarding structural invariance, the model met factor variance invariance after the Language and Visuospatial factor variances were unconstrained for the NHW and Hispanic groups. Evaluation of factor covariances was not permitted given noninvariant factor variances.

Sex/Gender by Racial/Ethnic.

The configural model fit well across the six racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups (χ2 [240] = 989.91, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = 0.056 [90% CI = 0.052-0.059], and CFI = 0.973) (Table 5). Similar to the results demonstrated across racial/ethnic groups, change in model fit was substantial when comparing the metric and scalar models (Δ CFI = −0.021). Partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing the intercept for the Naming Total indicator in the female and male NHW and female Hispanic groups and the Similarities indicator in the male NHW group. Effect sizes for intercept differences on non-invariant indicators were calculated based on the standardized difference between groups (e.g., (Naming intercept for NHW men – Naming intercept for Hispanic women) / pooled standard deviation). Using this scale 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 can be interpreted as small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively (Muthen, 1998-2004). The smallest effect size was 0.15 for the intercept difference between Hispanic women compared with Black men and women and Hispanic men on the Naming Total indicator, followed by 0.27 for the difference between NHW men and all other groups for the Similarities indicator. Effect sizes for Naming Total intercept differences between NHW men and NHW women compared with Black men and women and Hispanic men were 0.35 and 0.43, respectively. Medium effect sizes were noted for Naming Total intercept differences between Hispanic women compared with NHW men (0.50) and NHW women (0.57).

Results from the structural invariance analyses indicated that factor variance invariance was met once the Visuospatial factor variance was unconstrained for the female and male NHW and female Hispanic groups and the language factor variance for the female NHW groups, suggesting that the amount of within-group variability of this factor differed across these groups compared to the other racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups. Examination of equality of factor covariances was not conducted due to noninvariant factor variances.

Results from the invariance analyses across time indicated that the data fit full scalar invariance and full structural invariance in the entire sample, as well as in each racial/ethnic by sex/gender group except for Hispanic men (Table 6). For Hispanic men, full scalar and structural invariance was met for time 1 compared to times 2, 3, and 4; however, due to a large proportion of missing data at time 5, fit indices could not be calculated for the model assessing invariance between time 1 and time 5 due to a non-positive definite matrix.

Discussion

These results provide support for a three-factor model of memory, language, and visuospatial functioning in female and male Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Black, and Hispanic older adults across a range of cognitive functioning. There was evidence for stability of the model across racial/ethnic, sex/gender, and racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups. As expected, full measurement invariance was demonstrated across sex/gender, and only partial scalar invariance was demonstrated across racial/ethnic groups with intercept differences that varied by racial/ethnic and by racial/ethnic by sex/gender group. Examination of model modification indices suggested that the source of misfit in the partially invariant models was due to group differences on indicator intercepts for the language factor. This finding was not surprising given differences in educational attainment across racial/ethnic groups. The three-factor model was also stable over time within each racial/ethnic by sex/gender group as criteria were met for all levels of invariance across five time points.

The current study provides further support for findings from Siedlecki et al. (2014) by demonstrating invariant factor structure and factor loadings for this neuropsychological test battery in the racial/ethnically and linguistically diverse WHICAP sample. We add to the previous findings by expanding the current sample to include a range of cognitive functioning levels across racial/ethnic, sex/gender, and racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups, at five time-points. The previous study also demonstrated intercept noninvariance for the Naming Total and Similarities indicators. These intercepts were invariant when post-hoc invariance analyses were conducted across education-matched subsamples, suggesting that the intercept differences likely reflect the significant difference in educational attainment across groups.

Results from this study are consistent with previous studies examining the measurement invariance of different cognitive test batteries across sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic groups. Full measurement invariance has been demonstrated across sex/gender groups (Blankson &amp; McArdle, 2013; Maitland et al., 2000) but findings of measurement invariance across racial/ethnic groups have been mixed (Barnes et al., 2016; Blankson &amp; McArdle, 2013; Mungas et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the interaction between race/ethnicity and sex/gender on neuropsychological test performance among older adults across time. The current study demonstrated intercept differences for indicators on the Language factor between the male and female NHW and female Hispanic groups but not all other groups. Thus, combining racial/ethnic by sex/gender subgroups into one overall sex/gender group for analyses can obscure important sex/gender differences that vary by race/ethnicity.

When intercepts are noninvariant, observed indicator values will differ between groups at any given level of the factor. Although the Naming Total and Similarities indicators were related to the Language factor similarly across racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups, the location parameter of each intercept differed for some groups, and all predicted observed scores will differ at various levels of the factor as a result (Brown, 2015). For example, predicted scores for the male NHW group on the Similarities indicator will be higher than the other racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups with the same Language factor score. Similarly, predicted scores on the Naming Total indicator will differ for the male and female NHW and female Hispanic groups compared to the female and male Black and male Hispanic groups who will have similar Naming Total scores at the same level of the Language factor. These findings indicate that observed group differences on the Naming Total and Similarities indicators are not due to group differences in language ability. When differences in test performance cannot be explained by the latent ability of interest, it is likely that additional construct-irrelevant factors, that differ across groups, are causing group differences in test scores (McDonald, 1999), such as educational attainment and quality of education, acculturation level, socio-economic status, and English language proficiency. Group comparisons on the Language factor mean should be done by freely estimating intercepts for the Naming Total and Similarities indicators for NHW men and women and Hispanic women. Since half of the indicators on the language domain are demonstrated scalar invariance, this will allow unbiased estimation of factor mean differences across groups (Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998; Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000). However, it has been suggested that effect sizes above 0.40 indicate that violations of invariance are large enough to strongly interfere with conclusions regarding group differences (Nye, Bradburn, Olenick, Bialko, &amp; Drasgow, 2018). Thus, should these tests be used as stand-alone measures of language ability, as is typically done in the clinical context, normative group comparisons may be inappropriate depending on the racial/ethnic by sex/gender composition of the normative sample.

Structural invariance findings indicate that the range of scores on the language factor was larger for NHW men compared with all other groups. For the visuospatial factor, while the range of scores was smaller for NHW men and women compared with all other groups, the range was larger for Hispanic women. Given these non-invariant findings, we were unable to examine factor covariance, or whether the strengths of relationships between factors differed across groups (Brown, 2015). Any differences in the correlations between memory, language, and visuospatial performance across sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups should be interpreted with caution, as a result.

Examination of cognitive trajectories leading to AD or other dementias is essential to understand differences in onset and maintenance of cognitive disparities. In the absence of longitudinal measurement invariance, it cannot be determined if any group differences in cognitive trajectories are due to true change or to change in the structure or measurement of the cognitive constructs over time (McArdle, 2007). The current study demonstrated full measurement invariance over multiple assessment time points for each racial/ethnic by sex/gender group, thus, demonstrating the stability of the cognitive constructs over time and allowing for comparisons across groups and over time.

The BDAE repetition and comprehension subtests were excluded from the factor structure due to low standardized factor loadings (below 0.40), which indicated that these measures were not meaningfully related to the language factor (Brown, 2015). For the non-demented subsample of WHICAP examined in Siedlecki et al. (2010), factor loadings for these indicators 0.38 and 0.54 for the repetition and comprehension subtests, respectively, and intercept differences on the comprehension subtest were noted between English and Spanish speakers. Considering the current study included prevalent dementia cases, it is possible that both measures exhibit different psychometric properties across demented and non-demented participants. More research is necessary to determine whether these measures should be included in the calculation of language factor scores in the WHICAP test battery.

This study had several limitations. The sample was recruited from a neighborhood in Northern Manhattan that is predominantly NHW, Non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic, which is a limitation for national generalizability. Also, given that the Hispanics in this sample are primarily Caribbean emigrants, it is unclear whether these results apply to other Hispanic subgroups with different cultural immigration, and educational experiences. Future research should examine measurement invariance across sex/gender by racial/ethnic groups in other cohorts better suited to examine other understudied groups, such as Native Americans or Asian Americans, as well as different Hispanic subgroups. Participants in the study represented a range of cognitive status at baseline, from cognitively normal to clinical diagnoses of dementia. The incident dementia rate was approximately 13% across the entire sample. NHW men were least likely to be diagnosed with dementia at baseline, and NHW women and men had the lowest incident dementia rates compared to all other racial/ethnic groups. Black women and Hispanic men and women had the highest prevalent and incident dementia rates compared to all other groups. Variability in cognitive test performance may also be attributable to heterogeneity of cognitive impairment within racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups, independent of socio-cultural factors. Future studies should examine measurement invariance across different diagnostic subgroups within racial/ethnic by sex/gender groups. Further, it is also possible that other sources of bias, such as age entering the study, birth cohort, or education, interact with sex/gender and race/ethnicity. Such interactions are important to examine in future research.

This research has direct relevance for longitudinal studies aimed at understanding racial/ethnic and sex/gender disparities in AD. Overall, our findings suggest that performance on a neuropsychological test battery, measuring memory, language, and visuospatial functioning, can be meaningfully compared across sex/gender, racial/ethnic, and sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups over repeated measurements. Partial measurement invariance results suggest that some measures of language functioning may be more vulnerable to scalar non-invariance. However, group comparisons of language factor means would only be problematic if more than half of the items on the factor were invariant (Steenkamp &amp; Baumgartner, 1998; Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000). Nonetheless, interpretation of group differences on non-invariant tests when used as stand-alone measures of language should be approached with caution. The current study also highlights the importance of examining measurement invariance across sex/gender by racial/ethnic subgroups. Researchers should not assume that measures that are invariant across sex/gender will demonstrate full measurement invariance across men and women of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. Examining differences in cognitive trajectories in an educationally, socio-economically, and linguistically diverse sample of NHW, Black, and Hispanic men and women has the potential to provide valuable information about the onset and maintenance of disparities in AD.

Public Significance Statement:

Accurate identification of cognitive aging disparities is an important step in eventually eliminating disparities in dementia. Examining interactions between race/ethnicity and sex/gender may yield a more nuanced understanding of cognitive aging disparities and lead to the development of more targeted strategies to prevent or slow cognitive decline. The current findings suggest that the intersectionality of multiple identities is also important to consider when judging the validity of measures used to diagnose dementia and identify disparate cognitive trajectories.
