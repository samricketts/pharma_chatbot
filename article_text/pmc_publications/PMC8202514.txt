Background:

Evidence suggests that amyloid β (Aβ) peptides play an important role in the degeneration of neurons during the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the prevalent cause of dementia affecting the elderly. The endosomal-lysosomal system, which acts as a major site for Aβ metabolism, has been shown to exhibit abnormalities in vulnerable neurons of the AD brain, reflected by enhanced levels/expression of lysosomal enzymes including cathepsin D (CatD). At present, the implication of CatD in selective neuronal vulnerability in AD pathology remains unclear.

Methods:

We evaluated the role of CatD in the degeneration of neurons in Aβ-treated cultures, transgenic AD mouse model (i.e., 5xFAD) and post-mortem AD brain samples.

Results:

Our results showed that Aβ1–42-induced toxicity in cortical cultured neurons is associated with impaired lysosomal integrity, enhanced levels of carbonylated proteins and tau phosphorylation. The cellular and cytosolic levels/activity of CatD are also elevated in cultured neurons following exposure to Aβ peptide. Additionally, we observed that CatD cellular and subcellular levels/activity are increased in the affected cortex, but not in the unaffected cerebellum, of 5xFAD mice and post-mortem AD brains. Interestingly, treatment of cultured neurons with nanoparticles PLGA, which targets lysosomal system, attenuated Aβ toxicity by reducing the levels of carbonylated proteins, tau phosphorylation and the level/distribution/activity of CatD.

Conclusion:

Our study reveals that increased cytosolic level/activity of CatD play an important role in determining neuronal vulnerability in AD. Additionally, native PLGA can protect neurons against Aβ toxicity by restoring lysosomal membrane integrity, thus signifying its implication in attenuating AD.

Introduction

The neuropathological features associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include the presence of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, extracellular neuritic plaques and the loss of neurons in selected regions of the brain [1–4]. Structurally, neurofibrillary tangles consist of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and neuritic plaques contain a compact deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, both of which can form amyloid via cross beta-sheets [1, 3, 5, 6]. Pathological changes that characterize AD, together with the constitutive production of Aβ from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the normal brain [4, 7, 8], indicate that an overproduction or a lack of clearance of Aβ may increase its level which, in turn, contribute to neuronal loss and development of AD. The brain regions affected in AD include the neocortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain and certain brainstem nuclei, whereas the striatum and cerebellum are relatively spared [1, 9].

A variety of experimental approaches have shown that the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) system, which consists of the endocytic pathway and the lysosomal system, acts as an important site for APP/Aβ metabolism [5, 10, 11]. Consistent with this notion, marked abnormalities in the EL system have been reported in “at-risk” cortical and hippocampal neurons, prior to their degeneration in AD brains [12–15]. The anomalies, which precede clinical symptoms and extracellular Aβ deposition, include proliferation of lysosomes along with enhanced expression of the lysosomal hydrolases cathepsins B and D [12, 13, 15]. Transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing Aβ also exhibit an up-regulation of EL markers including cathepsin D (CatD) in selected brain regions [16–20], suggesting a potential role for the enzyme in the processes of AD pathogenesis [15]. CatD is an aspartic protease, which is involved in a variety of biological activities including degradation of intracellular proteins, processing of enzyme activators/inhibitors and regulation of cell death mechanisms [21–25]. It is reported that increased levels/activity of CatD within lysosomes may counteract cellular abnormalities resulting from aging or exposure to toxic agents [17, 26–28], whereas lysosomal leakage leading to release of the enzyme into the cytosol triggers apoptosis [18, 19, 29–35]. Consequently, Aβ-treatment of cultured neurons has been shown to enhance cytosolic levels of CatD following lysosomal permeabilization [36–38]. However, the significance of lysosomal leakage leading to the release of CatD into the cytosol and its association with neuronal vulnerability in AD brains remains unclear.

Interestingly, some recent studies have shown that poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles, which constitute a family of FDA-approved biodegradable polymers synthesized from the glycolic acid and lactic acid, can be used for prophylactic delivery of the antibiotic vancomycin after brain surgery [39–41]. Following internalization, these acidic nanoparticles traffic to lysosomes where they reduce lysosomal pH and lead to improved degradative activity of the lysosomal enzymes. The magnitude of acidification induced by PLGA is larger in compromised lysosomes with elevated pH than at baseline levels, suggesting PLGAs could be used in the treatment of various diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction [42]. In fact, PLGA can attenuate death of cultured neurons caused by the mitochondrial toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (i.e. MPTP, used in the development of an animal model of Parkinson Disease) by repairing impaired lysosomal function [43]. Additionally, it has been reported that PLGA nanoparticles conjugated with various drugs/agents can have beneficial effects on cellular and/or animal models of AD [44–52]. However, it remains unclear if native PLGA itself (i.e., unconjugated with any drugs/molecules) has an intrinsic activity to protect cultured neurons against Aβ-mediated toxicity by restoring lysosomal integrity [43]. To address this issue, we first evaluated the expression/levels, activity and subcellular profile of the lysosomal enzyme CatD in Aβ-treated cultured neurons as well as in affected (i.e., frontal cortex) and unaffected (i.e., cerebellum) regions of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD and post-mortem AD brains. Subsequently, we determined if native PLGAcan protect Aβ-treated cultured neurons by restoring altered level/activity and subcellular distribution of CatD. This study not only establishes a role for cytosolic CatD in determining neuronal vulnerability but also highlights the potential significance of native PLGA in the treatment of AD pathology.

Sources of primary antibodies are listed in Table-1. All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Paso Robles, CA, USA). All other chemicals were obtained from either Sigma-Aldrich or Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Mouse cortical neuronal cultures:

Timed pregnant BALB/c mice purchased from Charles River (St. Constant, Quebec, Canada) were maintained according to Institutional Animal Care guidelines. Primary cortical cultures were prepared from 18-day-old embryos of timed pregnant mice. In brief, frontal cortex from pup brains were dissected in Hanks’ balanced salt solution supplemented with 15mM HEPES, 10units/mL penicillin, 10μg/ml streptomycin and then plated on cultured wells or glass coverslips. The cultures were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27/N2 and all experiments were performed on day 6/7 after plating as described previously [53].

APP-Tg mice:

We used 5xFAD mice and the age-matched non-Tg control mice (The Jackson Laboratory) on C57BL/6xSJL background. The phenotype and characteristic features of these 5xFAD mice were described previously [54]. These mice were housed on a 12h light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. Different age groups of 5xFAD mice (i.e., 5 and 9month) along with age-matched controls were either euthanized by decapitation and their frontal cortex and cerebellum were processed for various biochemical assays or the mice were fixed by perfusion in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and their brain sections were processed for immunohistochemical staining.

AD and control brain tissues:

Post-mortem tissues from the frontal cortex and cerebellum of well characterized AD (n = 8; 3 males and 5 females; age 77.38±4.82 years) and neurologically normal controls (n=8; 4 males and 4 females; age 84.25±2.06 years) were obtained from The Douglas-Bell Canada brain bank (Montreal, Canada) and The Maritime brain tissue bank (Dalhousie, Canada). All AD cases were ascertained both clinically and histopathologically according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria [55]. The information about the control and AD patients were provided in the Suppl. Table-1. From each control and AD cases, frozen samples were used for biochemical assays, whereas 4% PFA immersion fixed tissues were used for immunohistochemistry.

Treatments of cultured neurons:

The oligomeric form of human Aβ1–42 or its reverse sequence Aβ42–1 used in all experiments was prepared as described earlier [56]. In brief, Aβ1–42 was initially dissolved at a 1mM concentration in hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), aliquoted in sterile microcentrifuge tubes, dried under a stream of N2 and stored at −80°C. Prior to use, the peptide was resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to 5mM, diluted with the media to 100μM, incubated overnight at 4°C and then added to cultured neurons to the required concentrations (1–20μM) for different periods of time (i.e., 6h, 24h or 48h). Cortical cultured neurons were treated with oligomeric 1–20μM Aβ1–42 for 24h or with 10μM Aβ1–42 for different period of times (6–48h). In some experiments, cultured neurons were pre-treated with pepstatin A (5–10μM) or native PLGA (100–200μg/ml) for 24h followed by exposure to 10μM Aβ1–42 for an additional 24h or neurons were co-treated with pepstatin A (5–10μM), native PLGA (100–200μg/ml) or with antioxidant agent CoQ10 (2μM) along with 10μM Aβ1–42 for 24/48h. In a parallel set of experiments, neurons were post-treated with pepstatin A (5–10μM) or PLGA (100–200μg/ml) for either 12h or 24h following exposure to 10μM Aβ1–42 for 12/24h. Control and Aβ-treated cultures were then processed for various assays.

Neuronal viability and toxicity assays:

Neuronal viability following various experimental paradigms was analysed using MTT and LDH assays as described earlier [57, 58]. Neuronal viability w as also assessed using the Live/Dead assay kit and then visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop-2 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction:

To determine alterations in CatD mRNA following Aβ treatment, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described earlier [53]. In brief, cellular RNA was first extracted with the RNeasy mini kit and then reverse-transcribed using iScript RT Supermix in the conditions as follows: 25°C for 5min, 46°C for 20min and 95°C for 1 min. [53]. Quantitative P CR was then carried out using SYBR green real-time PCR master mix according to manufacturer’s instructions. Mouse primer sequences used in the study are as follows: CatD (sense: 5’-CGCAGTGTTTCACAGTCGT-3’, anti-sense: 5’-TGAGCCGTAGTGGATGTCAA-3’); GAPDH (sense: 5’-TGAAGCAGGCATCTGAGGG-3’, anti-sense: 5’-CGAAGGTGGAAGAGTGGGAG-3’) and TATA sequence binding protein (TBP; sense: 5’-GGCCTCTCAGAAGCATCACTA-3’, anti-sense: 5’-GCCAGGCCCTGAGCATAA-3’). All primers were purchased from IDT (CA, USA). PCR was performed with MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, ON, Canada) and conditions used were as follows: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec and 60°C for 1 min. The relative quantitative values of CatD expression were normalized by the expression levels of TBP as well as GAPDH genes. Relative changes in CatD mRNA levels were analysed by the 2−ΔΔct method and presented as fold increase to the mean value of the control [59].

CatD activity assay:

Mouse cortical cultured neurons from various experimental groups and the brain tissues (i.e., cortex and cerebellum) from 5xFAD mice (i.e., 5 and 9month; n = 6–8/age group) and post-mortem AD (n = 8) cases along with equal number of respective control samples were processed to measure CatD activity as described earlier [33, 53].

Subcellular fractionation:

Cortical cultured neurons from different experimental groups and brain samples (i.e., cortex and cerebellum) from 5xFAD mice (i.e., 5, 9month old mice; n = 4–6/age group) and post-mortem AD (n = 8) cases along with the corresponding control samples were fractionated into cytoskeletal, cytosol, membrane and nuclear proteins using the Qproteome cell compartment kit as described earlier [33, 53]. Fractionated samples were assayed with BCA and then processed for Western blot using various antibodies as indicated in Table-1. All blots were re-probed to determine the equal loading of the cytosolic, membrane and nuclear fractions. Quantification of the blots were carried out using ImageJ [57].

Western blotting:

Western blotting of cultured cells and brain tissues samples was performed as described earlier [57, 58]. In brief, cultured neurons from various experimental paradigms and the brain tissues from 5xFAD mice (n = 6–8/age group) and post-mortem AD (n = 8) cases along with their corresponding controls were homogenized with radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer and proteins were quantified using BCA kit. Denatured samples were resolved on gradient sodium polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated overnight at 4°C with various primary antibodies at dilutions listed in Table-1. The membranes were then incubated with secondary antibodies (1:5000) and immunoreactive proteins were detected by ECL. All blots were re-probed with anti-β-actin antibody and quantified using a MCID image analysis system [57].

Detection of oxidative stress:

Control and Aβ-treated cortical cultured neurons with or without exposure to PLGA (100–200μg/ml) were assayed for protein carbonyl content using the Oxyblot™ protein oxidation kit following manufacturer’s protocol. All blots were re-probed with anti-β-actin to monitor protein loading [60].

Confocal Microscopy with LysoTracker and LysoSensor:

To evaluate endosomal/lysosomal changes, cortical cultured neurons were treated with 10μM Aβ1–42 for 24h in the presence or absence of pepstatin A or PLGA. The cultured neurons were then exposed to the LysoTracker for 30min and Hoechst 33258 (1μg/mL) for 5min, fixed with 4% PFA and then visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope at excitation and emission wavelengths of 577 and 590nm, respectively. In parallel, control and treated cultured neurons were exposed to 5μM LysoSensor for 10min [37] and the fluorescent signal was measured under a Zeiss confocal microscope at excitation and emission wave-lengths of 329 and 440nm, respectively.

Immunostaining:

Brain sections from the frontal cortex and cerebellum of 5xFAD mice (5 and 9month) and post-mortem AD cases along with their respective controls were processed as described earlier [16, 35]. With regard to cultures, neurons grown on coverslips were treated for 24h with or without Aβ1–42 in the presence or absence of PLGA, fixed with 4% PFA and then processed for immunocytochemistry. In brief, brains sections (30μm) and cells were incubated overnight with anti-CatD along with or without anti-Aβ (4G8) antibodies at dilutions listed in Table-1. Subsequently, sections/neurons were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488/594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000), washed and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop-2 microscope or a Zeiss confocal microscope.

Fluoro-Jade C Staining:

Fluoro-Jade C labels degenerating neurons, dendrites and axons [33, 61]. Brain sections from the frontal cortex and cerebellum of 9month old 5xFAD and control mice were incubated with 0.0001% Fluoro-Jade C in 0.1% acetic acid at room temperature, washed and examined using a Zeiss Axioskop-2 microscope [62].

Statistical analysis:

All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis for multiple comparisons or Student’s t-test for single comparison with a significance set at p &lt; 0.05. All analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA).

Results

Aβ1–42-induced toxicity and CatD in cultured neurons:

Mouse primary cortical cultured neurons are vulnerable to Aβ1–42-mediated toxicity, as evident from a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in MTT values. The reversed peptide Aβ42–1 did not alter MTT values, thus indicating the specificity of the effect (Fig. 1A and B). This was validated by a time-dependent increase in LDH levels in the conditioned media of the neurons treated with 10μM Aβ1–42 (Fig. 1C). The live/dead cell assay also revealed that exposure to 10μM Aβ1–42 for 24h could induce a marked increase in the number of dead neurons (Fig. 1D, E). In keeping with earlier studies [56, 63–67], we observed that Aβ1–42-induced toxicity was associated with increased levels of oxidative stress marker carbonylated proteins (Fig. 1F, J), enhanced levels of phospho-Thr202/Tyr204 extracellular-signal related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phospho-Tyr216 glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3β) (Fig. 1G, K), phospho-tau, cleaved-tau and cleaved-caspase-3 (Fig. 1H, L). Also, Aβ1–42 toxicity is accompanied by a marked increase in the levels of autophagic markers LC3-II and autophagy protein 5 (ATG5), unaltered levels of p62 and decreased levels of beclin-1 (Fig. 1I, M). However, no alteration in the cellular levels of cytochrome c, Bax or apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was evident in Aβ1–42-treated cultured neurons (Suppl. Fig. 1). To examine the influence of Aβ on lysosomal integrity, LysoTracker, a weakly basic amine that exhibits punctate labelling following its selective accumulation in cellular compartments with low internal pH, was used [68]. Our result s revealed a punctate labelling of LysoTracker in control but not in Aβ-treated neurons (Fig. 1N, O) suggesting a compromise in lysosomal integrity following Aβ treatment. This is partly supported by our labelling with LysoSensor [68], which displayed an acidic environment in the control neurons by yellow fluorescence and a more basic environment by blue fluorescence in Aβ-treated neurons due to leakage/breakdown of lysosomes (Fig. 1P, Q).

To determine potential alterations in CatD level/activity, we first measured mRNA and steady-state levels of CatD; these were markedly increased in Aβ1–42-treated cortical neurons (Fig. 2A–C). Moreover, the activity of CatD was enhanced in Aβ1–42-treated neurons (Fig. 2D). Our immunocytochemical results further revealed a diffuse distribution of immunoreactive CatD in Aβ-treated cultured neurons compared to control neurons (Fig. 2E, F). A number of earlier studies have shown that increased lysosomal leakage leading to sustained release of CatD into the cytosol can trigger cell death via cytochrome c release from mitochondria [18, 19, 25, 30–33, 35]. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c associates with Apaf-1, forming an apoptosome complex that, in the presence of dATP/ATP, is capable of activating caspase-9, followed by caspase-3 leading to cell death [24, 25, 69]. There is also evidence that CatD can induce permeability of mitochondria by cleaving the Bcl-2 family member Bid, which in its truncated form translocates to mitochondria, resulting in Bax/Bak activation [70, 71]. Damage to mitochondria may also lead to the release of other factors such as AIF, which can trigger cell death in a caspase-independent manner following its translocation to the nucleus [25, 72, 73]. To determine the potential role of CatD in Aβ1–42-induced toxicity, cortical neurons were treated with or without 10μM Aβ1–42 for 6h and 24h and then subjected to cytosolic, membrane and nuclear fractionations followed by Western blotting. Our results clearly showed that cytosolic and membrane CatD levels are not altered at 6h but significantly increased at 24h following treatment with Aβ1–42 compared to untreated control cultures (Fig. 2G, H). In parallel, cytosolic levels of cytochrome c, Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 as well as nuclear AIF levels were increased in 24h Aβ1–42 treated neurons compared to control cultures (Fig. 2G, I–L).

Mutant APP-Tg mice and CatD:

As a first step, we evaluated neurodegeneration along with the expression levels and activity of CatD in the affected frontal cortex and unaffected cerebellum of 5xFAD mice which exhibit extracellular/intracellular Aβ deposits, spatial learning deficits and loss of neurons in cortical regions of the brain compared to control mice [54, 74](Fig. 3). Our results revealed that Fluoro-Jade C degenerating neurons, as reported in earlier studies [33, 62], are apparent in the cortex but not in the cerebellum of 5xFAD mice (Fig. 3A, C, E, G). At the cellular level, CatD immunoreactivity in control mice was distributed in all layers of the cortex (Fig. 3B, B’). In the cerebellum, most Purkinje cells exhibited moderate CatD expression, whereas neurons of the granule cell layer displayed relatively low immunoreactivity (Fig. 3D). Although no obvious alterations in the distributional profile was apparent either in the cortex or cerebellum, CatD immunoreactivity was found to be more intense in the cortical neurons of 5xFAD compared to control mice. Additionally, all Aβ-containing neuritic plaques in the cortex of 5xFAD mice were labelled with CatD. A subset of cortical neurons of 5xFAD mice were also found to exhibit immunoreactivity for both Aβ and CatD (Fig. 3B, B’, F, F’). Unlike cortex, we did not observe any neuritic plaques or cellular Aβ in the cerebellum of 5xFAD mice (Fig. 3D, H). Our results further revealed that levels (Fig. 3I–L) and activity (Fig. 3M, N) of CatD were increased in the frontal cortex but not in the cerebellum of 5 and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice compared to control mice.

Our results also showed that cytosolic and membrane levels of CatD in the cortex were markedly increased in 5 and 9-month-old 5xFAD mice compared to controls (Fig. 3O; Suppl. Fig. 2A, C). As well, the cytosolic levels of cytochrome c, Bax and cleaved- caspase-3 were increased in the cortical region of 5xFAD mice (Fig. 3O, Suppl. Fig. 2A, E, G, I). No alteration in AIF was evident in any of the subcellular fractions of the cortex in 5xFAD mice (Fig. 3O; Suppl. Fig. 2A, K). Also, we did not observe changes in the levels of either CatD, cytochrome c, Bax or caspase-3 in any of the cerebellar subcellular fractions of 5xFAD mice compared to control mice (Fig. 3P, Suppl. Fig. 2B, D, F, H, J, L).

Human AD brains and CatD:

In keeping with the 5xFAD mice, our results showed strong CatD immunoreactivity in neurons as well as in a subset of Aβ-containing neuritic plaques in the cortex of AD compared to control brains (Fig. 4A, C). However, no marked difference in CatD labelling was evident in the cerebellum between AD and control brains (Fig. 4B, D). The levels and activity of CatD were also significantly increased in the cortex, but not in the cerebellum, of AD compared to control brains (Fig. 4E, F, G, I). Our subcellular fractionation results further revealed that CatD levels were markedly increased in both cytosolic and membrane fractions of the cortex of the AD brains compared to control brains (Fig. 4K; Suppl. Fig. 3A). While cytochrome c levels were increased in the cytosolic fraction, the levels of Bax were increased both in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of the AD cortex (Fig. 4K; Suppl. Fig. 3C, E, G). The subcellular distributions of CatD, cytochrome c, and AIF did not exhibit any variation in the cerebellum of AD brains compared to controls (Fig. 4L; Suppl. Fig. 3B, D, F, H).

Protective effects of pepstatin A against Aβ1–42-induced toxicity:

To establish whether increased CatD level/activity was a cause or consequence of toxicity, cortical cultured neurons were treated with different concentrations of the established CatD inhibitor, pepstatin A, either concurrently or 24h prior to exposure with 10μM Aβ1–42, and then neuronal viability was assessed using an MTT assay. Our results revealed that 5μM and 10μM pepstatin A could significantly protect neurons against Aβ-induced toxicity both following 24h pre-treatment and 48h co-treatment paradigms, whereas only 10μM pepstatin A protected neurons after 24h co-treatment with Aβ1–42 (Fig. 5A, B). Interestingly, 10μM pepstatin A was able to rescue cultured neurons following 12h but not 24h post-exposure to Aβ1–42 (Fig. 5C). The protective effect of pepstatin A was accompanied by decreased CatD activity (Fig. 5D) and cleaved-caspase-3 level (Fig. 5F, H) in Aβ-treated cultured neurons. The steady-state level of CatD, as reported earlier [75], was not altered in Aβ-treated neurons following pepstatin A treatment (Fig. 5E, G). Our lysotracker labelling further revealed that pepstatin A partly attenuated diffuse labelling of neurons observed after Aβ treatment (Fig. 5I–K). In parallel, we showed that Aβ1–42 toxicity, as reported in earlier studies [76, 77], was significantly attenuated following treatment with antioxidant CoQ10. Concurrently the levels of carbonylated proteins and CatD were reduced (Suppl. Fig. 4).

Protective effects of PLGA against Aβ1–42-induced toxicity:

At present, it remains unclear if native PLGA can protect neurons against Aβ-mediated toxicity by restoring lysosomal leakage. Thus, we first evaluated the toxic potency of PLGA in rat cortical cultured neurons. Our results show that 100–200μg/ml native PLGA did not exhibit any toxic effect following 48h exposure to cultured neurons, whereas 500μg/ml PLGA reduced neuronal viability after 24h exposure (Suppl. Fig. 5). Additionally, fluorescent PLGA localized to lysosomes following internalization into cultured neurons (Fig. 6A). Subsequently, we showed that both pre-treatment as well as co-treatment of cultured neurons with 100 and 200μg/ml PLGA along with 10μM Aβ1–42 for 24h was able to significantly protect neurons against toxicity (Fig. 6B, C). In these studies, 200μg/ml PLGA, but not 100μg/ml PLGA, rescued cultured neurons following 12h exposure to Aβ1–42 (Fig. 6D). The protective effect of the acidic nanoparticles was further validated by an attenuation in the number of dead neurons in Aβ+PLGA compared with Aβ alone treated cultures in our live/dead cell assay (Fig. 6E–H). Our LysoTracker labelling revealed that PLGA treatment decreased diffuse labelling of cultured neurons observed following Aβ treatment (Fig. 6I–L). This is supported by our LysoSensor labelling which displayed a more acidic environment in Aβ+PLGA-treated neurons, as observed in control and PLGA alone treated conditions (Fig. 6M–P). In parallel, we noted that the protective effects of PLGA against Aβ-induced toxicity are associated with attenuation of ERK1/2 and GSK-3β activation (Fig. 7A, D), decreased levels of phosphorylated and cleaved-tau protein as well as cleaved-caspase-3 (Fig. 7B, E). Additionally, PLGA significantly reduced the levels of protein carbonyl groups in Aβ-treated neurons, suggesting that its protective effect may partly be mediated by attenuating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig. 7C, F). Our results further showed that PLGA could decrease the level, activity and cytosolic distribution of CatD indicating potential restoration of lysosomal leakage/breakdown in Aβ-treated cultures neurons (Fig. 7G–M).

Discussion

Using a variety of experimental approaches, the present study reveals that lysosomal leakage leading to enhanced level/activity of CatD plays an important role in Aβ-induced degeneration of neurons and in the subsequent development of AD pathology. Our results show that: i) Aβ1–42-mediated toxicity in mouse cortical cultured neurons is accompanied by an impaired lysosomal integrity/acidic pH, increased production of toxic free radicals, phosphorylation of tau protein and its associated signalling mechanism; ii) cellular mRNA/protein levels and activity of CatD are enhanced along with cytosolic levels of CatD, cytochrome c, Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 levels in Aβ-treated cultured neurons; iii) CatD level/activity as well as its cytosolic levels are also increased in the affected frontal cortex but not in the unaffected cerebellar region of 5xFAD mice and post-mortem AD brains compared to respective controls; iv) pepstatin A, a potent inhibitor of CatD and antioxidant CoQ10 protected Aβ-treated neurons and finally v) native PLGA can attenuate Aβ toxicity by restoring lysosomal integrity and the level/distribution/activity of CatD. These results, taken together, suggest that lysosomal leakage and release of CatD may possibly underlie neuronal vulnerability in AD brains. Additionally, the evidence that native PLGA can protect neurons against Aβ toxicity by restoring lysosomal integrity and altered signalling pathways raises its potential in the treatment of AD pathology.

CatD and Aβ1–42-mediated toxicity:

Previously, a number of studies have shown that chronic exposure to Aβ peptides at μM concentrations can cause neuronal toxicity under in vitro paradigms [1, 64, 65, 67]. The mechanisms associated with Aβ toxicity are not clearly defined, but appear to involve alterations in intracellular calcium, production of toxic free radicals and/or activation of a caspase cascade culminating in cell death [56, 63–65, 67]. The present study, in keeping with earlier da ta, shows that treatment of cortical cultured neurons with Aβ1–42 enhanced the levels of carbonylated proteins, phosphorylation of tau kinases and tau protein as well as cleaved-caspase-3 levels. The autophagic marker s LC3-II and ATG5 are also increased, whereas levels of beclin-1 decrease as reported in earlier studies [78–80]. The levels of p62, a multidomain protein that acts as an adaptor for ubiquitinated cargos targeted for autosomal degradation, is not significantly altered in Aβ-treated cultured neurons [81]. In addition to altered signalling pathways, our results show that Aβ treatment of cultured neurons triggers a breakdown of lysosomal integrity, evidenced by diffuse LysoTracker staining concomitant with a basic pH environment reflected by LysoSensor labelling. Since Aβ can directly damage biomimetic vesicles/bilayers [38], it is possible that internalized Aβ peptide breaches lysosomal membrane integrity. Alternatively, Aβ following internalization can accumulate within lysosomes and trigger generation of ROS, apparent by an upregulation of carbonyl protein levels, which can subsequently lead to the breakdown of lysosomal integrity [82]. It is of interest to note that the lysosomal leakage observed in the present study in response to Aβ treatment may be a part of the well-known inflammatory sequelae involving the formation of the inflammasome by NLRP and ASC and the activation of diverse repertoire of stimuli including ROS production triggered by Aβ peptide [83, 84].

As a consequence of lysosomal membrane permeability, we observed enhanced cellular mRNA/protein levels, enzyme activity as well as cytosolic translocation of CatD in Aβ-treated primary neurons. A corresponding increase in the levels of cytochrome c, Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 indicates a role for the enzyme in cell death mechanism as detected in a variety of other toxic paradigms [24, 25, 35, 53]. This notion is substantiated by the evidence that pepstatin A can significantly protect neurons against Aβ toxicity by diminishing CatD activity, cleaved-caspase-3 levels and restoring diffuse LysoTracker DND-99 labelling. Since Aβ-treatment can enhance nuclear levels of AIF, it is likely that caspase-independent pathway may also participate in the degeneration of cultured neurons following cytosolic translocation of CatD as described earlier [23].

CatD in animal models and AD brains:

Some earlier studies have shown that CatD, as detected in the present study, is expressed in Aβ-containing neuritic plaques and its levels are increased in the cortical regions of mutant APP-Tg mouse brains [16, 18–20, 85]. We extended these results by revealing that increased level of the enzyme is associated with an enhanced activity in the frontal cortex of 5 as well as 9-month-old 5xFAD mice. Additionally, our subcellular fractionation studies showed that cytosolic levels of CatD, cytochrome c, Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 are increased in the cortical region of 5xFAD compared with control mice. Since 5xFAD mice exhibit loss of cortical neurons, as observed in the present and earlier studies [54, 74], it is likely that lysosomal breakdown leading to enhanced levels of CatD triggers the neuronal loss, similarly to Aβ-treated cultures. This is supported by two lines of evidence i) altering the activity of the lysosomal enzymes using lysosomal modulator PADK has been shown to attenuate Aβ level and cognitive deficits in two lines of APP-Tg mice [28] and ii) unlike control mice, CatD exhibited diffuse distribution in APP transgenic mice, which are known to exhibit loss of neurons as 5xFAD mice [18]. Additionally, no alteration either in the cellular level/activity or cytosolic level of CatD was evident in the relatively spared cerebellum of 5xFAD mice at any age.

The EL system plays a key role in the generation of Aβ-related peptides and has been shown to express enhanced mRNA/protein levels of various lysosomal enzymes including CatD in vulnerable neurons of the AD brain much prior to extracellular Aβ deposition [12–15]. Consistent with these results, we observed an increased level and activity of CatD in the cortex of the AD brains, as evident in 5xFAD mice, compared to age-matched controls. Additionally, the cytosolic levels of the enzyme, cytochrome c and Bax were also elevated in the cortical regions of the AD brains. No alteration, however, was apparent either in the level, activity or subcellular distribution of CatD in the unaffected cerebellar region of the AD brains. Since increased levels of cytosolic CatD along with cytochrome c and Bax are associated with neuronal loss following exposure to Aβ and in 5xFAD mice, it is likely that increased level/activity of the enzyme in the cortex may be due to progressive loss of neurons in AD brains.

PLGA nanoparticles and Aβ-mediated toxicity:

Evidence suggests that PLGA is able to reduce lysosomal pH, triggering improved degradative activity of the lysosomal enzymes [39–42]. Consequently, we observed that fluorescent PLGA once internalized into cultured neurons is targeted primarily to lysosomes. Additionally, native PLGA following pre-/co-treatments as well as in post-treatment paradigm was found to significantly protect cortical neurons against Aβ toxicity. This effect of PLGA appears to be mediated not only by decreased phosphorylation of tau protein and its associated signalling pathway but also via a decreased production of ROS – which may underlie the cause of lysosomal leakage. A role for ROS in Aβ toxicity is supported by the evidence that antioxidant CoQ10 protected the neurons by decreasing the levels of carbonylated proteins as well as CatD levels. The restoration of the lysosomal leakage/pH is supported by the evidence that PLGA treatment i) attenuates diffuse LysoTracker labelling in neurons exposed to Aβ, ii) reinstates a more acidic milieu in Aβ-treated neurons as detected with LysoSensor labelling and finally iii) diminishes the enhanced level/activity and lysosomal egress of CatD observed following Aβ treatment.

Significance of CatD and PLGA in AD pathology:

Although increased mRNA and protein levels of CatD, along with other lysosomal enzymes, have been demonstrated in AD brains [14–17, 86–88], the impact of this phenomenon on the pathology remains unclear. This would likely be an adaptive response to amyloid burden and the consequence of a role for the enzyme in the degeneration of neurons. Some studies have indicated CatD may regulate APP processing as well as lysosomal clearance of Aβ but these remain to be validated as deletion of CatD gene did not alter Aβ levels [89–91]. More recently, it has been demonstrated that CatD levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and in neural-exosomes isolated from blood of AD patients were higher than control subjects, indicating its potential use as a biomarker of AD [92, 93]. Complementing these results, we showed that the level/activity and cytosolic translocation of CatD are increased in vulnerable cortical region, but not in relatively spared cerebellum in 5xFAD mice and post-mortem AD brains. Given the critical role of cytosolic CatD in Aβ-induced toxicity, it is likely that increased activity and translocation of the enzyme in vulnerable regions of the AD brain reflect the cause and not the consequence of neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, the specific strategy of using an inhibitor of CatD enzymatic activity may have drawbacks as a treatment of AD because of the contribution of the enzyme to bulk proteostatic flux and the evidence that lysosomal permeability lies upstream of CatD-mediated cell death mechanism.

Interestingly, PLGA nanoparticles without any conjugated agent/drug are found to protect neurons against Aβ toxicity by preventing lysosomal leakage and attenuating the level/activity as well as cytosolic translocation of CatD. This is unique as PLGA is mostly used in transporting drugs such as donepezil and curcumin and the beneficial effects on cellular or animal models of AD are attributed to the drug and not the nanoparticles [44–52]. Although the mechanism by which PLGA restore lysosomal integrity remains elusive, reducing production of toxic free radicals, as apparent from our study, may have a role in the restitution of the lysosomal membrane integrity. It is also possible that native PLGA by regulating other mechanisms such as tau phosphorylation or production/aggregation of Aβ can protect neurons against toxicity. Nonetheless, our results reveal that increased translocation of CatD into cytosol may act as an important marker in determining neuronal vulnerability in AD brains and PLGA without any conjugated drug/agent may have a unique potential in the treatment of AD pathology.
