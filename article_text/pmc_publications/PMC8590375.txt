Background:

While being obese in mid-life is associated with an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline in late-life, being obese in late-life is shown to be associated with a lower risk of these outcomes in some studies. This phenomenon is known as the “obesity paradox”, but the underlying reasons and potential sex difference have not been well understood.

Objective:

To investigate the association between cognition and waist circumference (WC), an alternative measure of body fat which can be measured easier than body mass index (BMI), among older adults in each generation of late-life for men and women separately.

Methods:

Three hundred thirty-five participants were used in the current study who were identified by random sampling of residents aged 65–74, 75–84, and 85+years in Takashima County, Shiga Prefecture, Japan during 2005–2006. Associations between WC and domain-specific cognitive functions measured by 12 neuropsychological tests were examined using multivariable linear regression models with covariates: age, education, and hypertension.

Results:

Larger WC was associated with better attention/working memory among 65–74-year old women and with better learning/acquisition among 65–74-year-old men, while larger WC was associated with worse learning/acquisition, memory, attention/working memory, and language/fluency among 75–84-year old men.

Conclusion:

We found age and sex differences in the association between WC and domain-specific cognitive functions. Among older old men (age 75–84), larger WC had negative effects on various domains including memory, attention, language, and executive functions, while we did not find any negative effects of larger WC on cognition among women in any age groups.

pmcINTRODUCTION

The world’s population is aging, and Japan has the longest life expectancy in the world [1, 2]. However, the longer life expectancy has led to an increase in the number of people with chronic diseases, including dementia [3]. The age-specific prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, seems to be increasing in Japan [4, 5]. Prevention of cognitive impairment including preclinical AD [6] is one of the public health priorities in Japan [7].

Obesity predominantly affects non-communicable diseases including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease [8, 9]. In contrast, in a phenomenon known as the “obesity paradox”, being obese in later-life has been shown to be associated with better cognitive function and protective against dementia or cognitive decline [10–12]. According to previous studies, being obese in mid-life, but weight loss and thinness in late-life, are associated with a high risk of dementia in late-life. Being obese in late-life is either not associated with cognitive function or associated with a lower risk of global cognitive impairment and dementia [11, 13–19]. In these studies, obesity was measured using body mass index (BMI). However, BMI can underestimate body fat due to body composition changes and increased abdominal obesity [20]. On the other hand, shrinkage of the spine caused by scoliosis and vertebral bone loss, or kyphosis in older adults [21] might overestimate body fat due to reduced measured height. Therefore, waist circumference (WC) may be a better indicator of body fat or abdominal obesity [21]. Larger abdominal fat has shown to be associated with the better global cognitive function among elderly women, but inversely associated among elderly men. However, sex differences in the association between body fat and domain-specific cognitive functions is yet to be examined to further clarify the underlying mechanisms [22, 23]. In this study, we examined a sex difference in the association between WC and domain-specific cognitive functions among randomly selected non-demented older adults living in Takashima, Japan [24].

We hypothesized that larger WC would be associated with better domain-specific cognitive functions, as implied by the obesity paradox, in older women based on previous findings [18, 22, 23].

METHODS

Study design and participants

Takashima Study is a population-cohort study aimed to examine the risk factors for cardiovascular disease [24–26]. As a part of Takashima Study, we conducted the Takashima Cognition Study between 2005 and 2006, a population-based survey in Takashima County, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. In this survey, residents of Takashima County were sampled randomly from each of three age groups: 65–74, 75–84, and 85+years. Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to 957 randomly selected residents. A total of 391 residents consented to participate and underwent face-to-face interviews [24]. Details of the Takashima Cognition Study are published elsewhere [24]. For the current study, we included community-dwelling older adults with WC data and Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (J-MMSE) test scores≥21. The conventional threshold J-MMSE score of 24 for defining cognitive impairment was lowered to 21 to account for the low educational level of the sample, as described previously [24]. Of the 391 participants interviewed, 66 participants were excluded (40 participants had J-MMSE score&lt;21, 17 had missing WC data or missing J-MMSE data, and nine had invalid data outcomes). Therefore, 325 participants are included in the current study.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Shiga University of Medical Science (No.17–17) and Oregon Health &amp; Science University (IRB00006845) and it is in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. All participants signed informed consent form.

Domain-specific cognitive functions

In addition to J-MMSE, as an indicator of global cognitive function, 12 interview-based neuropsychological tests were administered comprising the following cognitive domains: Word List Immediate Recall (learning/acquisition) and Word List Delayed Recall (memory) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) [27]; Block Design-5 blocks, even numbers (visuospatial ability) from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) [28]; Trail making Test A (psychomotor Speed) and Trail making Test B (Executive function) [29]; WAIS-R Digit Span Forward and Backward (attention/working memory) [28]; and Word Fluency Category (language-based executive function) from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease (CERAD) [30]. The above tests were previously validated in Japan [24, 31]. Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Copy (visuospatial ability), Immediate Recall (visuospatial immediate recall), Delayed Recall (visuospatial memory) [32], and Verbal Fluency Letter (language/fluency) [33] are conventionally used in Japan.

In ADAS Word List Immediate Recall (learning/acquisition) and ADAS Word List Delayed Recall (memory), lower scores indicate better cognitive function. In all other test items, higher scores indicate better cognitive function.

Waist circumference

WC was measured at the level of the umbilicus while standing during the late exhalation phase using a non-elastic measuring tape in centimeters [34].

Additional variables

Demographic variables of age and years of education were included in the models. We also included presence of hypertension in the models due to its potential mediating effect between WC and cognitive function [35] and a large prevalence of those with hypertension among this cohort. Blood pressure was measured twice and hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90mmHg. As a sensitivity analysis, we also ran models with potential confounders which included age, years of education, drinking, marital status, frequency of sports, alcohol status, smoking status, Japanese geriatric depression scale score, the number of prescription medication, and medical history including hypertension, cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus, stroke, and cancer.

Statistical analysis

Participants were classified into three age groups: 65–74, 75–84, and 85+ years. Basic characteristics of the age groups were summarized using mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables and proportion for categorical variables. We examined the association of domain-specific cognitive functions with WC among age categories using multivariable linear regression models stratified by sex. The neuropsychological test scores were transformed into z-scores by using the mean and standard deviation of each test scores. Each outcome was approximately normally distributed. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. However, as a reference, we also provided multiple comparison adjusted p-value. The Bonferroni corrected p-value was calculated by 0.05 divided by 12, the number of cognitive function tests and then it was rounded to 0.004. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Characteristics of 160 women and 165 men study participants are shown in Tables 1A and 1B. The mean age (SD) [range] was 77.5 years (7.2) [66.0–98.0] among all participants.

Tables 2A and 2B show that mean WC was not different by age groups in women or men. The mean WC (SD) [range] was 83.4cm (9.9) [56.0–115.0] among all participants. Domain-specific cognitive function test scores were worse as age increased among both women and men except for WAIS-R Digit Span Forward and Verbal Fluency Letter for which the scores are relatively stable regardless of age. In women, WAIS-R Digit Span Backward scores was worse as age increased, but not in men.

Results for women

Larger WC was associated with better WAIS-R Digit Span Forward test scores (attention/working memory) among women aged 65–74 years and including hypertension did not modify the result (p = 0.012, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.009 to 0.068 without hypertension, p = 0.023, 95% CI: 0.005 to 0.067 with hypertension). No other domain-specific cognitive functions were associated with WC in any age groups among women (Table 3A and Supplementary Table 1A).

Results for men

Larger WC was associated with better ADAS Word List Immediate Recall test scores (learning/acquisition) among 65–74 years old men and including hypertension did not modify the result (p = 0.003, 95% CI: −0.059 to −0.013 without hypertension, p = 0.003, 95% CI: −0.059 to −0.013 with hypertension). With and without adjusting for hypertension, larger WC was associated with worse test scores of the ADAS Word List Immediate Recall test (learning/acquisition), the ADAS Word List Delayed Recall test (memory), the WAIS-R Digit Span Forward and Backward test (attention/working memory), and Verbal Fluency Letter test (language/fluency) among men aged 75–84 years. No other domain-specific cognitive functions were associated with WC among any age groups (Table 3B and Supplementary Table 1B).

DISCUSSION

This work examines findings from community-dwelling, relatively healthy, Japanese older residents of Takashima County free from cognitive impairment. Larger WC was associated with better attention/working memory among younger old women (age 65–74 years) and larger WC was associated with better learning/acquisition among younger old men (age 65–74 years). In contrast, larger WC was associated with worse learning/acquisition, memory, attention/working memory and language/fluency among 75–84-year-old men. We did not see any negative effects of larger WC on cognition among women in any age group.

Several studies have examined the association between being obese or having increased body fat and cognitive functions or incidence of dementia [17, 18, 22, 23, 36, 37]. Several studies found that obesity measured by BMI in late-life was associated with a lower risk of global cognitive decline and dementia among older adults including Asian population [17, 36, 37]. However, these studies did not examine the potential sex difference. Two prospective cohort studies evaluated the association between abdominal fat and cognitive function for women and men [22, 23]. The first study observed 3,054 older adults (70–79 years old at baseline) in the Health, Aging and Body Composition (ABC) Study with follow-up of over seven years found that larger WC and more abdominal fat measured by computed tomography were associated with a higher risk of global cognitive impairment only among men [22]. The second study investigated 5,607 postmenopausal women (mean age: 63.8 years) with follow-up for seven years found more abdominal fat mass (subcutaneous fat and visceral fat) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was associated with less global cognitive impairment [23]. In a cross-sectional analysis, larger total fat mass measured by DEXA in late-life was found to be associated with better global cognitive function among older Asian women, but not among men [18]. These previous studies suggest that the effects of being obese, having increased body fat, or abdominal fat on cognitive function vary with age and sex. Our findings are partly consistent with these studies showing the association between abdominal fat measured by WC and better cognitive function among younger old women, while inverse associations were found only among older old men. Our study further contributed to the existing evidence by showing that these association were seen in the domain of attention/working memory, learning/acquisition, memory and language/fluency with sex difference even after adjusting for hypertension as one of established and mediating vascular factors for cognitive decline [35].

Physical exercise is associated with executive functions and attention [38, 39]. The detrimental effects of larger WC among men aged 75–84 on learning/acquisition, memory, attention/working memory, and possibly executive function indicated by verbal fluency letters, could due to lack of exercise. We did not see these negative effects of larger WC among women. The effects of estrogen may explain this lack of negative effects among women. That is, estrogen favorably affects cognitive function via estrogen receptors in the hippocampus and amygdala [40] and adipose tissue is also a major source of endogenous estrogen in postmenopausal women [41]. Additionally, a larger central fat mass is correlated with estradiol levels in postmenopausal women, and estrogen, but not testosterone, lowers the risk of cognitive impairment [23, 42]. The adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, may explain the association between larger WC and improved cognition among those aged 65–74 years [43].

Our study had some limitations. First, while we discerned that there may be some advantage to larger WC in terms of cognitive function among women in comparison with men, it is unclear if excessive obesity has the same effect on cognitive function among women because our WC measurements only ranged from 56.0 to 115.0 cm. Second, these results were obtained from one county in Japan, and therefore may not be generalizable, in particular to people of other races who may have different body compositions. Third, the cross-sectional nature of this study limits the ability to induce causal relationships and may potentially suffer from reverse causations where those who are at risk of cognitive decline or dementia lose weight long before these events [44]. Fourth, the main objective of the baseline survey conducted between 2005 and 2006 was to clarify the association of daily activities and lifestyle with domain-specific cognitive function [24]. Therefore, residual confounding due to unmeasured variables may exist, such as body composition measures other than WC, nutrition data such as food frequency and diet, and biochemical data on factors including amyloid-, tau, and the ApoE4 allele. Further, random errors associated with the one-time WC measurement may have occurred. More invasive methods of measuring BMI and biochemical information were not feasible due to the age of the study population [45]. We also lowered MMSE cutoff points (21, instead of conventionally used threshold score of 24) to screen out those with frank dementia because mean years of education of our participants was 10 [46, 47].

The current study also has several unique strengths. First, the study participants were randomly sampled using an age-stratified sampling method. Second, cognitive functions measured are not limited to global cognition, which allowed us to examine the association with different cognitive domain. Furthermore, the association of domain-specific cognitive function with WC was investigated across three age groups of non-demented Japanese older adults, and we found a difference in the effect of WC on cognition among these age groups.

In conclusion, abdominal fat measured by WC is a potentially modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment. Positive associations between larger WC and better attention/working memory and learning/acquisition were observed among non-demented young-old Japanese older adults. But among older old men, we found negative effect of WC on various cognitive domains. Our findings are consistent with some of previous studies, and suggest varying roles of WC among different age groups and by sex in older adults. Further research is needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms, and to develop strategies to maintain cognitive health tailored for specific sex and age groups.
