Background

Cerebrovascular dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease is heterogeneous and may contribute to disease pathophysiology or progression. There is a need to understand the mechanisms by which cerebrovascular dysfunction is altered in participants with Parkinson’s disease.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that participants with Parkinson’s disease exhibit a significant reduction in the ability of the cerebral vessels to dilate in response to vasoactive challenges relative to healthy controls.

Methods

The current study uses a vasodilatory challenge while participants undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the amplitude and delay of cerebrovascular reactivity in participants with Parkinson’s disease relative to age and sex matched healthy controls. An analysis of covariance was used to evaluate differences in cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude and latency between Parkinson’s disease participants and healthy controls

Results

A significant main effect of group was observed for whole brain cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude (F(1, 28) = 4.38, p = 0.046, Hedge’s g = 0.73) and latency (F(1, 28) = 16.35, p &lt; 0.001, Hedge’s g = 1.42). Participants with PD exhibited reduced whole brain amplitude and increased latencies in cerebrovascular reactivity relative to HC. Evaluation of regional effects indicate that the largest effects were observed in the cuneus, precuneus and parietal regions.

Conclusions

Parkinson’s disease participants exhibited reduced and delayed cerebrovascular reactivity. This dysfunction may play an important role in chronic hypoxia, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation, mechanisms that could lead to disease progression. Cerebrovascular reactivity may serve as an important biomarker and target for future interventions.


pmcIntroduction

Perhaps the largest hurdles for developing efficacious treatments for Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the lack of mechanistic understanding of pathogenesis and factors contributing to disease progression in addition to objective biomarkers for early identification and stratification of patients based on the location and extent of neuropathological processes. Emerging evidence suggests that cerebrovascular dysfunction is an etiological driver of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative conditions [1,2], rather than a co-occurring neuropathological process [3,4]. Additionally, cardiovascular risk factors and co-occurring cerebrovascular disease predict the progression and severity of cognitive symptoms in Lewy body dementias [3–5], suggesting that direct measurement of cerebrovascular dysfunction is an important factor to detect and monitor over time. Since a rapid and adequate cerebrovascular dilatory response is crucial in maintaining brain perfusion under a variety of conditions of stress, there is a crucial need to understand whether cerebrovascular reactivity is altered in PD.

Cerebrovascular dysfunction in PD is heterogeneous and associated with established vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, as well as risk factors unique to PD, such as baroreflex dysfunction, blood pressure variability with neurogenic orthostatic hypertension, and supine hypertension [6,7]. Together, these factors may contribute to disease progression by impacting the functioning of the neurovascular unit. Prior MRI studies have primarily used arterial spin labeling (ASL) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging to evaluate the impact of cerebrovascular dysfunction on clinical outcomes via quantification of perfusion/cerebral blood flow, arterial arrival time, and white matter hyperintensities. ASL imaging has indicated regional reductions in cerebral blood flow in the middle frontal gyrus (including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) [8–10] temporal regions [8–10], cuneus [8,9], precuneus [8,9,11], supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobe [8,10–15], occipital [8–10,15], caudate [8], and thalamus [8] in participants with PD relative to HC. Additionally, increased cerebral blood flow has been observed in the right post-central gyrus, thalamus, and globus pallidus in participants with PD relative to HC [15–17]. Examination of the arterial arrival time (the delay in the cerebral blood flow response at rest), has demonstrated that patients with PD also exhibited significantly delayed arterial arrival time [13,16,18] relative to HC. Finally, increased volume of white matter hyperintensities [3–5,19,20], has been associated with cognitive decline in PD.

While ASL can quantify a reduction in blood flow, MRI cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) paradigms are a recently developed technique that can measure the ability of the cerebral vessels to dilate in response to vasoactive challenges such as carbon dioxide inhalation [21]. CVR provides a functional assessment of the neurovascular unit, which can help differentiate to what extend observed reductions in blood flow in PD are due to dysfunction of the cerebrovascular cells and whether this may be a more sensitive measure to detect changes in PD. Prior efforts have evaluated the impact of levodopa medication on CVR and have demonstrated no difference in participants ON and OFF dopaminergic medications [22]. While one study failed to find differences between participants with PD relative to controls [13], another found increased CVR in motor regions associated with worsening motor scores [23]. A major limitation of these prior reports is the latency of CVR response was not quantified, even though cerebrovascular dilatory response varies in speed and magnitude. Further, the latency and amplitude of CVR differs between the gray and white matter, with significant reductions in amplitude and longer delays in the white matter [24], highlighting the importance of evaluating whether there is differential disruption in the gray versus white matter in PD. Finally, in light of the perfusion work that indicates both decreases (in fronto-parietal cortical regions) and increases (in regions of the basal ganglia) in perfusion, it is important to evaluate how regional effects differ in PD. To address these questions, the current study tested the hypothesis that participants with PD have increased latency and decreased amplitude of CVR relative to age and sex-matched healthy controls using a carbon dioxide as a vasodilatory challenge while participants undergo blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI imaging.

Methods

Participants

25 participants with PD and 17 HC between the ages of 50 and 89 were recruited into the study. For PD, inclusion criteria include a previous diagnosis based on United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank Criteria. Healthy controls were free of any neurological conditions. Exclusion criteria for the participants included 1) a history of a) neurological diagnosis other than PD, b) previous traumatic brain injury with &gt;5 min loss of consciousness, c) learning disability, d) any psychiatric disorders persisting for an extended period of time (greater than 6 months) other than depression or anxiety, 2) non-fluency in English, or 3) current or past substance dependence/abuse. This study was approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Human Research Review Committee. Participants provided written informed consent. 4 HC and 6 PD were excluded from final analysis due to issues during data acquisition rendering either fMRI or breath data unusable.

Neuropsychological and Clinical Assessments

Demographics (age at baseline, age at symptoms onset, years of education, and sex) and clinical characteristics (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale [25] Part III total score and Hoehn and Yahr Scale, PD disease duration [since symptom onset and diagnosis], and levodopa equivalent daily dose) were assessed [26]. Additionally, capacity to perform daily activities was assessed with The Modified Schwab and England Percent Activities of Daily Living [ADL] Scale). Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was defined as a reduction in blood pressure greater than 20 mmHg systolic, or 10mmHg diastolic, with changing from the supine to standing position (or as a reduction in blood pressure greater than 30 mmHg systolic in participants with hypertension) [27,28]. The neuropsychological test battery included Level II Comprehensive Assessment based on the MDS task force diagnostic criteria (neuropsychological testing that includes two tests within each of the five cognitive domains)[29]. To characterize the cognitive performances of the groups, data are presented on global functioning (Montreal cognitive assessment; MoCA[30]), in addition to measures typically associated with cerebrovascular disease ((Symbol Digit Modalities Test [SDMT [31]) and those that are predictors of cognitive impairment in PD (verbal episodic memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised [HVLT-R [32]; delayed recall, and discrimination recognition score]), visuospatial functioning (Benton Judgment-of-Line-Orientation total score [JLO [33]), language (semantic fluency – animal naming [ANIM]), and executive functioning (Trail Making Test B [34]). Given that prior work indicated no effect of medication on CVR [22], all participants were ON medications while completing the study procedures.

CVR Paradigm

All participants completed a hypercapnia challenge modified from [35] while undergoing BOLD-based imaging. We used the computerized RespirAct™ system (Thornhill Research Inc. Toronto, Canada), to precisely control arterial end-tidal CO2 (end-exhalation; ETCO2), minimize inter-subject variability, maximize test-retest reliability and our ability to detect differences in CVR. In contrast to common paradigms that administer fixed concentrations of inspired gases, the RespirAct™ system calculates a breath-by-breath inspired gas concentration to target 10 mmHg ETCO2 [36]. This includes a baseline collection that includes 4–5 minutes of participants breathing regularly, followed by four on-off cycles (35 seconds on with a pseudorandom inter-block off interval of 30±5 seconds to better model hemodynamic change).

Neuroimaging Acquisition

T1-weighted images were collected using either the four-echo Human Connectome Project (HCP) sequence [TE (echo time) = 1.81, 3.6, 5.39, and 7.18 ms, TR (repetition time) = 2.5 s, TI (inversion time) = 1 s, 8° flip angle, number of excitations (NEX) = 1, field of view (FOV) = 256 mm, voxel size = 0.8×0.8×0.8 mm], or a five-echo MPRAGE sequence [TE = 1.61, 3.47, 5.33, 7.19, and 9.05 ms, TR = 2.53 s, TI= 1.2 s, 7° flip angle, NEX = 1, FOV = 256 mm, and voxel size = 1.0×1.0×1.0 mm isometric]. Functional data were collected using protocols based on the HCP Aging protocol [37] [TE = 37 ms, TR = 800 ms, 52° flip angle, NEX = 1, FOV = 208 mm, and voxel size = 2.0×2.0×2.0 mm, 72 slices, multiband acceleration factor = 8], which included a single-band reference image (SBRef), and two spin-echo field mapping sequences with reversed phase encoding directions (A → P; P → A) to correct for susceptibility-related distortion.

Image Preprocessing

Imaging data were processed using a combination of AFNI [38], ANTS [39], FSL [40], and SPM-12 [41] software. Only those images that passed visual quality inspection by two independent raters were included in the analysis. T1-weighted images were first skull stripped using antsBrainExtraction. antsRegistration normalized images to the MNI 152 template using the BsplineSyN transformation with an initial alignment determined by antsAffineInitializer. Tissue segmentation was performed using SPM-12 in subject space, subsequent gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps were converted to masks using a 60% threshold and aligned to template space using the T1-to-MNI warp.

Motion regressors were saved using AFNI’s 3dvolreg and their first-order derivatives were calculated using AFNI’s 1d_tool.py. Mean framewise displacement (meanFD) was calculated as the average of the frame-by-frame translational (x, y, and z) and rotational (roll, pitch, and yaw; converted from degrees to millimeters; [42]) head motions across the entire sequence. Each run of the functional data was first despiked (3dDespike), time-shifted (3dTshift), and registered to the single-band reference image in both 2D (2dImReg) and 3D (3dvolreg) using AFNI. Images were then distortion corrected using FSL’s topup. Data were aligned to the subject’s T1 image using FSL’s FLIRT Brain Boundary Registration and the subsequent warp was combined with the T1-to-MNI normalization to align the fMRI data to MNI space. Finally, a 6mm gaussian blur kernel was applied using AFNI’s 3dmerge.

Data was processed similar to previously published studies.[43] Peak-to-peak interpolation was conducted on the ETCO2 data measured by the RespirAct™ system in MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) followed by sampling of the interpolated line at times corresponding to scanner images to generate an ETCO2 vector for use as a regressor in BOLD analyses. Functional imaging maps (AFNI’s 3dfim+) were calculated using a family of time lagged ETCO2 regressors (GM: 8.0 to 26.4 seconds; WM 12.0 to 35.2 seconds) to identify which latency results in maximal fit to ETCO2 at the voxel-wise level [44,45]. In other words, AFNI’s 3dfim+ returned the highest Pearson correlation coefficient between any single time-lagged ETCO2 regressor and each voxel’s fMRI timeseries as well as returning the associated latency index to this maximal fit. The voxel-wise maximal fit Pearson correlation coefficient maps were transformed to Fisher’s Z-scores. Amplitude of CVR was quantified as the change in BOLD response per unit change in end-tidal CO2 (%BOLD/mmHg) [35]. The index of maximal fit is converted to real time (seconds) to obtain voxel-wise latency maps.

To obtain summary measures, we calculate the average (using AFNI’s 3dmaskave) across the whole brain, gray matter, and white matter, respectively, for both amplitude of maximal fit and latency following published methods [46]. We identified regions of interest (ROI) that exhibited differences in prior arterial spin label (ASL) studies when comparing PD to HC to evaluate whether we observed any regional effects. ROIs included the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), caudate, globus pallidus, thalamus, postcentral gyrus (defined as Brodmann areas [BAs] 1–3), middle frontal gyrus (BAs 9 and 46), precuneus (BA 31), supramarginal gyrus and superior parietal lobe (BAs 7 and 40), cuneus (BA 17), and occipital region (BAs 18 and 19). We used the CIT168 brain atlas for the SNc [47], the Harvard-Oxford cortical and subcortical structural atlases for regions of the basal ganglia [48] and The TT Daemon AFNI atlas (nonlinearly transformed to standard TTN27 space and then warped to MNI space) for Brodmann areas [49]. Average amplitude and latency were calculated for each ROI using 3dmaskave.

Statistical Analyses

All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.2.0. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate group differences between PD and HC in the whole brain CVR amplitude and latency accounting for age and sex. Additionally, the same ANCOVA was used to evaluate ROI and voxel-wise CVR amplitude and latency. Bonferroni correction was used for the ROI analyses to correct for multiple comparisons. Results were corrected to achieve an expected cluster-wise false positive rate of 5% (p &lt; 0.05) based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations with individual voxels required to have p &lt; 0.001. The minimum recommended cluster size correction from these simulations was 760 μl.

Results

Participants

19 PD (Female: 11, Age: 71.9 ± 7.3 years, Education: 18.0 years [17.5–19.0]) and 13 HC (Female: 9, Age: 70.5 ± 8.1 years, Education: 17.0 years [16.0–18.0]) were included in the final analysis (Table 1). There were no significant differences in demographic information, with the exception of education that exhibited a trend (p = 0.07).

Summary metric and ROI analyses

Results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1. A significant main effect of group was observed for whole brain cerebrovascular reactivity amplitude and latency. Participants with PD exhibited reduced whole brain amplitude and increased latencies in cerebrovascular reactivity relative to HC. Similar effect sizes were observed for metrics calculated from gray and white matter regions. ROI results indicate significant increases in latencies in patients with PD relative to HC across all regions examined, though only the postcentral gyrus, precuneus, supramarginal gyrus and cuneus regions survived corrections for multiple comparisons. Additionally, significant reductions in amplitude were observed in the postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, cuneus, and occipital regions in patients with PD relative to HC, however, none of these effects survived corrections for multiple comparisons. Supplemental Table 1 presents the ROI analyses repeated using demeaned amplitude and latency ROIs (ROI latency/WB latency). Patients with PD exhibit significantly increased latency in the precuneus and supramarginal gyrus relative to HC, though only the effect in the supramarginal gyrus survived correction for multiple comparisons.

While no participants were excluded due to motion, we identified group differences in FD (p = 0.049) in addition to a motion outlier in the participants with PD group. To ensure our results were not driven by motion, we re-ran analyses accounting for FD and separately excluding the motion outlier. Similar effect sizes were observed when accounting for FD in analyses (e.g. all whole brain, gray matter, and white matter amplitude measures exhibited medium effect sizes (range = 0.70 – 0.76) and all latency measures exhibited large effect sizes (range = 1.35 – 1.41) across whole brain, gray matter, and white matter metrics. Similar effect sizes were observed when analyses were re-run excluding the single motion outlier in the cohort. The remaining cohort exhibited low levels of motion (e.g. 91% of the cohort exhibited FD &lt; 0.5) and there wsd no longer group differences in FD when the outlier was removed.

Voxel-wise analyses

A significant main effect of group was observed for the voxel-wise latency (Figure 2). Individual cluster results are presented in Table 3. While results were present in various regions across the brain, there was a notable predominance of effects observed in the posterior regions, including the precuneus and parietal regions. Using stringent fMRI thresholds, we did not observe significant effects of amplitude in our voxel-wise analyses.

Discussion

Cerebrovascular disease is commonly conceptualized as a co-occurring disease process that independently contributes to progression of clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment in PD. The current study evaluates whether MRI CVR measures, which capture the ability of the cerebral vasculature to respond to vasodilatory stimuli, are abnormal in PD. Our results showed that CVR was significantly different in participants with PD in both reduced amplitude and delayed (longer latency) response. Regional evaluations indicated increased latencies in PD relative to HC in all regions examined, with the postcentral gyrus, precuneus, supramarginal gyrus and cuneus regions surviving corrections for multiple comparisons. Additionally, significant reductions in amplitude were observed in the postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, cuneus, and occipital regions in patients with PD relative to HC, though none of these effects survived corrections for multiple comparisons. Voxel-wise evaluations indicated increased latency of CVR in participants with PD across the brain, though there is a relatively greater deficit in the posterior cortical regions. Our results suggest robust CVR dysfunction in PD that includes an overall reduced response as well as an increased latency of the response in participants with PD.

While prior efforts have failed to support such effects, it is likely because the earlier approaches did not quantify and account for latency of the response [13,23] and leveraged different methodology (e.g. using ASL CVR, which includes a continuous period of hypercapnia). Compared to BOLD MRI, ASL has a much lower signal-to-noise ratio that can also be confounded by changes in the bolus arrival time and labeling efficiency related to the changes in blood flow velocity during hypercapnia [21]. The measurement of latency using our BOLD CVR approach exhibits the most robust effects in our analyses (large effect sizes, Hedge’s g = 1.46). Similar patterns have been observed in perfusion data – while few studies have examined arterial arrival time (the delay in the cerebral blood flow response at rest), those that have found that patients with PD exhibited significantly delayed arterial arrival time [13,16,18] in addition to reduced cerebral blood flow [8,11,12,14].

Reductions in cerebral blood flow in PD relative to HC have been observed across fronto-parietal, temporal and occipital regions, with more pronounced effects in the parietal and occipital cortical regions (e.g. precuneus, cuneus, supramarginal gyrus). We localized the regional change in the latency of CVR using both ROI and voxel-wise analyses to the precuneus, cuneus, supramarginal gyrus and posterior regions. It is notable that reduced perfusion in posterior regions corresponds to progression of cognitive symptoms [8–12,14,15]. The most predominant theory of cognitive dysfunction in PD suggests there are two patterns of cognitive impairments in PD: frontoparietal (executive-attention) and posterior cortical (memory, language, and visuospatial) [50–52]. Fronto-executive dysfunction is likely secondary to the impact of α-synuclein aggregation and damage to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and related regions [53,54]. Posterior alterations include changes in the temporal lobe (associated with amnestic memory impairments) [55,56] and posterior parietal and occipital lobe (associated with visuospatial impairments) [57,58]. Notably, the posterior alterations may be due to heterogeneous pathological processes that may include: progression of α-synuclein, co-occurring amyloid-β and tau abnormalities, and cerebrovascular related dysfunction [59,60]. It is likely, given the participants with PD in our cohort exhibited significantly reduced executive function in addition to reduced visuospatial and memory performances relative to controls, that the participants with PD may be experiencing posterior dysfunction secondary to increased CVR latencies.

Prior studies have challenged whether the reduction of cerebral blood flow is driven by neuronal loss rather than cerebrovascular dysfunction. Our results suggest that the reduction may be related to cerebrovascular vessel dysfunction, though future research is necessary to evaluate whether altered cerebrovascular reactivity accounts for the observed perfusion deficits. Additionally, prior work indicated no differences in patients ON and OFF medications [22], suggesting differences are not driven by medication effects. However, future work is necessary to evaluate this using our analytical approach that incorporates the latency of the response.

Cerebrovascular functioning in PD can be impacted by a variety of factors, such as baroreflex dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, and supine hypertension [6,7]. This spectrum of dysfunction results in both blood pressure variability as well as hypertensive processes, both of which may contribute to cerebrovascular small vessel disease. Additionally, a delayed cerebrovascular response may be the result of endothelial cell dysfunction as these cells play a key role in signaling vasoconstriction through binding to receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells [61]. Furthermore, endothelial dysfunction may contribute to increased protein (e.g., synuclein) aggregation via impaired clearance mechanisms [62] and directly contribute to impaired synaptic plasticity, axonal repair, and impaired learning [63]. In a recent study of individuals with preclinical Alzheimer disease, endothelial dysfunction was found to be associated with cognitive outcomes to a comparable extent to amyloid and tau pathologies [63]. In this context, reduced and delayed CVR responses likely lead to micro-stresses to the brain every time there is a need for increased blood flow as well as chronic or episodic hypoperfusion. There are several potential effects of chronic hypoperfusion, including neuronal death [64], glial activation [64], and alpha synuclein aggregation [65,66]. This would suggest that episodic hypoperfusion due to reduced and delayed CVR could potentially lead to increase neuroinflammatory processes and/or alpha-synuclein aggregation, both of which are considered key components of PD pathogenesis. Supporting this idea is that patients with PDexhibit increased volume of white matter hyperintensities that are associated with cognitive decline [3–5,19,20]. Thus, CVR dysfunction may contribute to white matter hyperintensities via an inadequate ramp up of brain perfusion resulting in a state of chronic or episodic hypoperfusion.

The current study exhibits numerous strengths, including cutting edge CVR methods, including the computerized RespirAct™ system to calculate a breath-by-breath inspired gas concentration to attain targeted CO2 levels, resulting in an unbiased measure [36]. However, the current results are based on a small sample size that requires replication in an independent cohort. Additionally, power analyses based on the effect sizes observed in perfusion studies indicate that we are well powered to detect latency changes, but not amplitude or associations between CVR measures and clinical outcomes. Thus, larger sample sizes are crucial to systematically evaluate the amplitude changes and associations between CVR and clinical measures such as autonomic, cognitive, and motor symptoms. Further, there are limitations of CVR using BOLD MRI that should be considered when evaluating CVR in clinical population. While our use of the Respiract system may mitigate this by more precisely targeting ETCO2, prior work indicates that CVR varies as a function of basal ETCO2 and as a function of the change in ETCO2 in response to the vasodilatory stimuli [67]. While BOLD MRI has better signal-to-noise ratios relative to ASL for CVR analyses [21], it does exhibit regional variation and low SNR in certain brain region can affect impact CVR measurements. Additionally, there is a non-linear relationship between cerebral blood flow and BOLD signals, making it challenging to interpret BOLD CVR changes.

Taken together, the current study indicates patients with PD exhibit robust disruption in CVR. Future work is necessary to further understand the role of altered CVR in PD. CVR may serve as an important biomarker and target for future interventions.

Figure 1. Results of whole brain and regional CVR metrics. Participants with Parkinson’s disease (PD) exhibited reduced amplitude (A) and increased latency (B) relative to healthy controls (HC) in their cerebrovascular response to a vasodilatory challenge with similar effects observed across whole brain (WB), gray matter (GM), white matter (WM). Evaluation of the following regions of interest (substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), caudate (Cau), globus pallidus (GP), thalamus (Tha), postcentral gyrus (PCG), medial frontal gyrus (MFG), precuneus (PC), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), cuneus (Cun), and Occipital regions (Occ)) indicated robust increases in latency in PD relative to HC. PD patients generally exhibited regional reductions in amplitude relative to HC, however, effects were relatively smaller than those observed for latency with larger effects observed in the posterior cortical regions. Significance is marked with asterisks for p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.01 (**), and p&lt;0.001 (***).
