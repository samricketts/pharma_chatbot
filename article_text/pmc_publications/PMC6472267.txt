Nanoscale fibrils formed by amyloid peptides have a polymorphic character, adopting several types of molecular structures in similar growth conditions. This property, evidenced in both experimental (i.e., solid-state NMR) and computational studies, hinders both the structural characterization of Alzheimer’s Aβ amyloid protofilaments and fibrils at a molecular level, as well as the possible applications (i.e., development of drugs or biomarkers) that rely on similar, controlled molecular arrangements of the Aβ peptides in amyloid fibril structures. We have explored the use of several contact potentials for the efficient identification of minimal sequence mutations that could enhance the stability of specific fibril structures while simultaneously destabilizing competing topologies, controlling thus the amount of structural polymorphism in a rational way. We found that different types of contact potentials while having only partial accuracy on their own, lead to similar results regarding ranking the compatibility of wild-type (WT) and mutated amyloid sequences with different fibril morphologies. This property allows exhaustive screening and assessment of possible mutations and the identification of minimal consensus mutations that could stabilize fibrils with the desired topology at the expense of other topology types; a prediction that is further validated using atomistic molecular dynamics with explicit water molecules. We apply this two-step multiscale (i.e., residue and atomistic-level) approach to predict and validate mutations that could bias either parallel or anti-parallel packing in the core Alzheimer’s Aβ 9–40 amyloid fibril models based on solid-state NMR experiments. Besides shedding new light on the molecular origins of a structural polymorphism in WT Aβ fibrils, this approach could also lead to efficient tools for assisting future experimental approaches for amyloid fibril determination, and for the development of biomarkers or drugs aimed at interfering with the stability of amyloid fibrils, as well as for the future design of amyloid fibrils with a controlled (e.g., reduced) level of structural polymorphism.

Graphical Abstract


Introduction

Despite the increasingly significant clinical and societal impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the complex molecular processes at its core remain poorly understood. The AD was first referred to in 1906 by Alois Alzheimer as ‘a peculiar severe disease process of the cerebral cortex’.1 While at the beginning the topic generated limited interest in the scientific community, AD grew to present a crucial biomedical challenge, being the most common cause of dementia among elderly people and is currently considered an irreversible brain disorder.

The study of Aβ molecular fibrils formed by aggregated amyloid peptides, which are involved in the development and progression of the AD, is key to fully understand AD and its origins.

The amyloid β (Aβ) peptides associated with AD, consist of 38 to 43 amino acids chains.2,3 They are products of β- and γ-secretases acting on the transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP).4–6 Aβ peptides are the main component of extracellular deposits, which are one of the hallmarks of AD.7,8 Upon cleavage, Aβ monomers are released into the extracellular environment, where they assemble into oligomers, fibrils, and eventually, into filaments, that is deposited on and interacting in a complex manner with the neural membranes.9. These filament-like structures are the major components of amyloid plaques.

In the molecular structural biology of the AD, the ‘amyloid hypothesis’ states that the disease is the effect of Aβ accumulation and deposition.10 On the other hand, the ‘cascade hypothesis’ regards this accumulation as just an early event in the AD progression.11

Understanding the exact mechanism of toxicity induced by fibrillar aggregates is still a matter of debate. There are reports showing that Aβ peptides are neurotoxic12 and that its aggregation is required for toxicity,13,14 while other studies show that Aβ peptides could have a positive effect on different regulatory aspects of neuronal function.15 The Aβ fibrils found in amyloid plaques have been considered to be the main pathological markers of AD,16 with several recent studies reporting that protofibrils and soluble oligomers, rather than the fully formed fibrils, are the more toxic species.7,8,17–21 These findings suggest that the final products of peptide aggregation in AD plaques (i.e., fibrils and high-order oligomers) may not be directly involved in cytotoxicity, as they are absent in certain forms of the disease22, and do not impair cell survival.23 This could imply that the smaller fibrillar oligomers may also be more toxic due to their reduced size and greater diffusion rates through tissues, while fibrils tend to be less dangerous as they sequestrate the small oligomers in insoluble deposits.19,24

Recently, substantial advances were made by X-ray micro-crystallography and high-resolution AFM experiments.25,26 However, they remain limited to studies of fibrillar aggregates with much smaller lengths than the full-length Aβ (e.g., in the range from 2 to 11 residues).27

A pioneering step forward that allowed structural studies of full-length Aβ40 and Aβ42 was achieved more than a decade ago by experimental studies using solid-state NMR (ss-NMR) measurements in conjunction with electron microscopy.28–30 Before this key milestone, only limited information on the molecular structure of Aβ fibrils was available from fiber diffraction data, described them as ribbon-like β sheets arranged in a cross β orientation. Due to ssNMR experiments, interatomic and intermolecular distances and backbone dihedral angles of the peptides in the amyloid fibrils can be estimated. Both solid-state NMR data and structural models support parallel β-sheet structures formed by 40 to 42 residues of typical β amyloid peptides.31–33 Interestingly, ssNMR data in conjunction with mass-per-length measurements from electron microscopy showed that the Aβ protofilaments fibrils are dimeric (i.e., they contain two peptides in a fibril layer) and that the inter-peptide interactions in a fibril layer occur preferentially between the two C-terminal beta-sheet regions and are mediated primarily by hydrophobic contacts. Earliest data was consistent with protofilament structures with parallel C-terminal β-sheets,34,35 while subsequent studies, (both experimental and modeling studies31), showed that both cases lead to fibrils with very similar stabilities, which makes their experimental investigation difficult.31,36

In Figure 1, a schematic representation of a dimeric layer (N-terminal, red, and C-terminal, blue) separated by a turn region (green) is shown. Thus, in these models, dimeric protofilaments models can have either (A) parallel C-terminal beta-sheets (i.e., with Cx2 symmetry if the beta sheet regions are aligned through a 180° rotation about the x-axis), or (B) antiparallel β-sheet orientations (i.e., with Cz2 symmetry, where the fibril is aligned through a 180° rotation about the z-axis).37,38

The two topologies differ in the relative orientation of the contacting C-terminal sheets in the interface between the two U-shaped peptides within a two-peptide unit: the two strands are parallel in C2x structures, and antiparallel in C2z structures.

To discriminate between these two major topologies, we study the fibril stability in response to mutations at the interface between them two C-terminal β-strands (cyan), with the goal to design minimally mutated sequences that that would maximize the difference instabilities between the Cx2 and Cz2 topologies.39–41

Here, we use a combination of coarse-grained and atomistic-level modeling methods to perform the computational redesign of Alzheimer’s Aβ 9–40 fibrils, which were shown both experimentally and computationally to have indeed a high propensity for the topologies illustrated in Figure 1. We ask the question: could the formation of specific protofilament structures be controlled through a minimal set of thoughtfully designed mutations, which could bias one topology type versus the other? To address this question, in this study we develop a new approach developed based on coarse-grained statistical potentials and complex maps of interactions for each residue in the investigated structures. This method makes it possible to find, through an efficient and exhaustive screening, the minimal number of mutations that would strengthen the structure interactions in one confirmation and significantly weaken them in all other possibilities. Selected mutations were validated by use of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and effects of alterations were systematically compared to the wild-type sequence of Aβ 9–40 in the same conditions. Our multi-scale approach to controlling amyloid fibril topologies brings a significant improvement in the emerging field of amyloid fibril design, leading to efficient yet reasonably accurate screening for desired mutation outcomes.

Methods

Statistical contact potentials

Statistical contact potentials (CPs) are some of the simplest yet most widely used representations of inter-residue interactions. Since their introduction in 1975,42–44 statistical CPs have been successfully used in many applications ranging from protein structure prediction to protein docking. Typically, the statistical potentials are presented as numerical tables that quantify the interactions between the 20 amino acids using a 20 by 20 matrix. Its elements give the interaction strength between a pair of amino acids at contact in arbitrary units. Two amino acid residues are considered as being in contact if the distance between them is less than a certain cut-off distance, rcut.

Some of the most widely used statistical potentials, used in this study, were developed by Miyazawa and Jernigan (MJ-9645 and MJ-9946), Betancourt and Thirumalai (BT)47, Skolnick et al. (SJKG)48 and Hinds and Levitt (HL)49 (Figure S1).

Typically, the contact potentials are derived from known protein structures, and hence rcut is chosen to reflect the value used in the X-ray or NMR structures.

Studies50–53 of the 20 by 20 contact potential matrices suggest that eigenvalue analysis is useful for characterizing the underlying physical driving forces directly involved in protein folding.

As shown in the Supplementary Information (SI) Fig. S1, here the CP matrices were rearranged such that the amino acid order is the same as in the Miyazawa-Jernigan matrix (MJ-96), with bluer shades corresponding to more attractive interactions, while more red shades correspond to stronger repulsions.52 showed that the famous Miyazawa-Jernigan potential matrix has only two dominant eigenvalues and that their corresponding eigenvectors are strongly correlated to each other and to a hydrophobicity scale. The presence of the two dominant eigenvalues implies that only two types of residues (hydrophobic (H) and polar (P)) are needed to describe the significant forces that determine the nature of protein folding.

More recently,50 a detailed MJ-96 potential based analysis showed that the origin of the firm HP character of the interactions is due to essential correlations between the elements of the leading eigenvector (qi) and the dipolar moments (Qi) of the side chains.54

These observations support the widely held view that the most relevant characteristic of a given residue’s interactions is described through its interaction with water.55,56

The relationship between hydrophobicity and the principal eigenvector of statistical potentials matrices was further used by57 to study the structure, stability, and evolution of proteins,58–61 and the minimal set of amino acids that are required for a reasonable accuracy of contact potentials.62 The analysis of several different CPs in Ref.62 showed that only between 7 and 9 amino acids of varying chemical character are needed to accurately reconstruct a full CP matrix. This illustrated the importance of modeling accurately interactions between small hydrophobic residues,62 and of taking specifically into account the protein backbone when dense packing in protein structures.62,63

We started by analyzing atomistic structures with the two Cx2 and Cz2 topologies (Figure 1), which have the same amino acid chains but different relative orientations.

The two stacks of U-shaped peptides have either parallel (Cx2) or antiparallel orientation (Cz2), with equivalent fibril, ends in the case of Cx2 fibrils, and different end structures in the case of Cz2 fibrils.

Moreover both structures Cx2 and Cz2 are slightly shifted in respect to each other not only in z plane but also in the x-axis.

The amino-acid sequence of the Aβ1–40 peptide is illustrated in Figure 1. The mutations studied here (from single to five sites) leading to the highest (most stabilizing) score in each case are highlighted in cyan.

Coarse-grained modelling of desired mutation effects

In the first-stage study of atomic-level models of Aβ protofilaments we focused on the binding interface (considering amino acids 30 to 40). With the use of VMD64, the two topologies of Aβ peptides (Cx2 and Cz2) were first analyzed to obtain a full list of possible contacts between every amino acid. Here, a residue-residue contact is defined as occurring between every amino acid that has all their heavy atoms separated by a distance of at least rcut = 0.5 nm.

As a result of this study on dimeric Aβ fibril structures, an average of 6 contacts per amino acid has been found. Since amino acid chains in both cases are identical, the divergence in contacts is only due to the different 3D spatial conformations of fibrils. It can be observed that, in 3D, even relatively minor differences between topologies can cause a major difference in interaction energies (and corresponding z-scores) between the stacks of peptides in the protofilaments.

After mapping the underlying network of contacts in the fibril structures, we used an algorithm that creates new mutations at precisely the same positions in both topology types. That was performed by changing from one to five amino acids mutated at the same time in the C-terminal interface area between the two protofilaments of the amyloid fibrils, and then calculating the new value of the interaction potential energy and the corresponding z-scores based on contact potential tables. For this experiment, about 3,200,000 different types of mutations of studied fibrils were generated. Values of the five contact potentials (see above) for MJ-96, MJ-99, HL, SJKG, BT in every case were calculated. Based on these values, the most promising candidates were selected for further study.

Finding the best mutations

Figure 2, presents distributions of CP energies for all possible mutations at the C-terminal interface, in cases when the different CPs are used to assess the relative stability of the system. Interestingly, regardless of the fact that these CPs were obtained using different methods, based on a variety of biochemical considerations, the majority of them place the energies of wild-type (WT) sequences on the left side of these histograms, an indication that they all can provide a significant level of confidence in assessing the relative stability of these structures. In general, for statistical CPs, if the energy value for the selected system is positioned to the left of the mean of the corresponding CP energy distribution, this indicates an increased stability of that system. Thus Cz2 WT is more stable than Cx2 WT, however with an increasing number of mutations Cz2 is more likely to find mutations that are more destabilizing as compared to Cx2.

Z-score-based ranking

To assess the extent to which a set of one or more mutations are more stabilizing or destabilizing, we calculate the standard score (also known as z-score)62,65,66, for the statistical potentials corresponding to the mutated structure relative to the distribution corresponding to all possible mutations of that kind (i.e., at those specific amino-acid sites). The difference between the mean value and the WT value of the potential energy for each distribution is quantified by the standard score (see also SI).

There are several different inter-residue statistical potentials that have been developed for coarse-grained (CG) representation of molecular interactions.62 Here, we are using some of the most popular statistical CPs: HL, BT, MJ-96, MJ-99, SJKG. We note that many additional contact potentials are available, but we are limiting our study to these ones due to their good robustness and popularity reflected by recent comparative studies.62 They have been developed using different approaches, concepts and underlying models and, therefore, they present various parameters on very different scales. To enable comparison between energies calculated for every contact potentials, the CP values were normalized. Additionally, rather than comparing absolute contact energies, we use a statistical parameter, (the standard score, or z-score) that characterizes relative rather than absolute effects of perturbations such as mutations of the inter-residue interactions, concerning the first two moments (i.e., mean value and standard deviation) of the underlying potential distribution.62

For a normal distribution, the standard score (z-score in energy, zE) is defined as in Eq. 1 (1) zE=E−μEσE

Where μE is the mean CP energy value and σE is the corresponding standard deviation.

Thus, the standard score represents the distance between the value of energy for the mutated system and the population mean in units of the standard deviation. A negative z-score value would correspond to a mutation that is more stabilizing, and a positive standard score would correspond to a mutation that is more destabilizing on average.

Minimal number of necessary mutations

To find an optimal mutation that in the Cz2 case would make the system unstable and in case of Cx2 make it more stable or not influence its stability at the same time. The data were segregated based on the number of mutated residues and 20 mutations were selected for each group that in Cz2 have the most positive value of standard score and simultaneously in Cx2 the top negative value.

When only a single mutation is introduced the difference between standard scores in structures is negligible, but this significantly rises with increasing the number of mutated residues. The z-score is up to 3.4 times greater with five mutations as compared to single-reside mutations. In Figure 3, we show standard score differences (Δz) calculated for contact potential energies obtained for Cx2 and Cz2 fibril structures, in cases where the same mutations were implemented, and for five different types of contact potentials. Here, N is the total number of mutations, and the z-score values shown were averaged over the top 20 results in our exhaustive mutation screening calculation. Note that for the WT sequence (N = 0) we obtain similar standard scores for all contact potentials used. However, in order to obtain ΔzE values that correspond to approximately one standard deviation, the majority of cases required at least three simultaneous mutations for this condition to be satisfied for all contact potentials employed (except for the older MJ-96, see Figure 3).

To test the stabilizing or destabilizing effects of the mutations found by our Δz screening method, selected residues were mutated to the desired amino acids using the atomistic structural models of Alzheimer Amyloid β peptides presented above. As in previous studies, infinite fibril models were constructed as illustrated in Figure 4. To model very long fibrils, periodic boundary conditions were modified so that in the Z-axis direction the distance between periodic images of peptides was 0.48 nm.37 This construction allows structures to freely move in the x-y plane, whereas due to periodicity in the z-axis, twisting is not possible.37

In Figure 4, a representation of the initial atomistic model of the Aβ protofilament system with an infinitely-long topology (i.e., due to periodic boundaries) is shown. The system is replicated periodically along the fibril z-axis using a simulation box (outlined in cyan) of a size corresponding to an integer number of backbone hydrogen bonds and solvated using explicit water molecules. The color-coding for secondary structure elements is the same as the one used in previous figures.

MD simulations and data analysis

The Python67 the programming language was used (version 2.7) with SciPy libraries (version 0.13.3)68 to design the algorithm for mutations based on contact potentials The initial structures were obtained based on previously performed simulations of the Aβ. Before testing mutations, the original system was first solvated, minimized, heated and finally equilibrated. All the atomistic MD simulations were performed using NAMD69 with the CHARMM3670 force field, under the same conditions in the NPT ensemble (a constant value of pressure, temperature, and number of atoms) with periodic boundary conditions. The temperature was set to 310 °K and was controlled by Langevin thermostat with a damping coefficient of 10 ps−1, the pressure was maintained at 1.01325 bar level. The switching distance for non-bonded electrostatic and van der Waals interactions was 0.95 nm with a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. Integration step was set to 1 fs. Each system was solvated with explicit TIP3P water molecules [112] before minimization, heating, and equilibration. The PyMol71 the software was used for structure visualization. MDTraj72 for data analysis and Matplotlib73 for plotting.

The total atom numbers for each tested system including water molecules and other parameters are reported in Table 1.

Results and discussion

Multiple promising cases of mutations were tested (Figure 5), here we describe in detail the effects of the G33V, G37K, V39E mutations that had one of the top scores for combined contact potentials, and can be valuable for further study, as it destabilizes Cz2 which in nature is more stable than the rest of Aβ structures and it also stabilizes Cz2 (examples of other tested cases can be seen in the SI figures).

It is observed that Cx2 remains stable, even with mutations present, for the entire simulation time, while Cz2 moves apart after 40 ns and stays in this relative position for the rest of the simulation.

In Figure 6, we present the outcomes of the atomistic MD simulations that were run to test the effects of the mutations predicted by our coarse-grain method. Both structures are having exactly the same mutations: G33V (red side chains), G37K (blue side chains) and V39E (orange side chains) and as predicted for Cx2 (top: A, B, C, and D) they don’t cause any significant conformation changes where for Cz2 (bottom: E, F, G, and H) they having clearly de-stabilizing effect.

To characterize the structural stability of our amyloid fibril models with both Cx2 and Cz2 topologies, we also monitor a set of inter-residue distances that can capture directly critical structural perturbations in WT and mutated fibrils occurring during the MD run.

In Figure 7, the distances between the residues 36 and 32 (i.e., defined as distances between the center of mass of the heavy atoms in the side chains) that is located in the middle of the C-terminal β-strands but on different neighboring peptides in the fibril structure, shown for four atomistic systems of WT and mutated fibrils with Cx2 and Cz2 topologies. These distances indicate that for both WT systems, these distances remain relatively stable during the entire duration of the MD runs. Reassuringly, our mutations designed to stabilize the structures with Cx2 topology succeed (green curve in Figure 7) while also destabilizing the corresponding Cz2 topology structure with the same mutated sequence (blue curve in Figure 7).

Values of distance between two residues that are located in the middle of Alzheimer β-amyloid C-terminal β-strand but placed in opposite stacks for four atomistic systems, (Cx2, Cz2 WT and Cx2, Cz2 with mutation) are presented on Figure 7.

Distances of the same residues of wild-types for both structures are similarly constant as Cx2 mutated during the whole period of simulation and have average values of 2.52 nm for Cx2 and 2.47 nm for Cz2. The distance between the 24th and 29th amino acid in the Cx2 the mutated case stays relatively constant throughout the simulation, with only small fluctuations of about 1.5 nm. While for the Cz2 mutated case, starting with the same inter-residue distance as Cx2 reaches values of up to 3.97 nm.

To investigate further the effect of our predicted mutations, we analyze additional collective variables that are correlated with different physical-chemical stability properties of amyloid fibrils. Figure 8 shows the corresponding time evolutions during atomistic MD simulations of several collective variables such as: (A) the fraction of native contacts, Q, (B) the root mean square deviation (backbone), (C) the radius of gyration, and (D) the solvent accessible surface area calculated for the same four WT and mutated systems as in Figure 7.

The graph of the fraction of native contacts (Figure 8A) shows clearly that in all cases the number of native contacts decreases, which is the result of the system’s relaxation. It is also observed that the mutated systems have a 15% the greater decline in the number of native contacts than their WT counterparts. This is due to the fact that the mutated systems are more unstable than the WT and therefore should have a lower value of native contacts. Cx2 WT also decreases significantly more compared to Cz2 WT due to fluctuations of the N-terminal residues.

The root mean square deviation (RMSD) is another quantitative indicator of system stability. Results of Cα RMSD calculations for four atomistic systems, (Cx2, Cz2 with mutations and without mutations) were calculated and are presented in Figure 8B. RMSD values in three cases: Cx2 wild-type, Cz2 wild-type and Cx2 mutated are converged and remain stable along the entire simulation. They do not show any significant instability with a mean value of RMSD 0.44 ± 0.04 nm for Cx2 wild-type, 0.34 ± 0.03 nm for Cz2 wild-type and 0.51 ± 0.07 nm for Cx2 mutated. Conversely, RMSD for the Cz2 mutated structure starts in line with the other results and then increases dramatically reaching values of up to 1.43 ± 0.27 nm. This indicates that Cz2 is the most unstable and dynamic of the four systems.

The radius of gyration (Rg) results presented in Figure 8C correlate with the RMSD data analyzed previously. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients for Cx2 wild-type is 0.53, Cz2 wild-type is 0.54, Cx2 mutated is 0.67 and Cz2 mutated is 0.98. The Rg graph clearly shows the stage in the simulation where Cz2 mutated becomes unstable (2500 – 5000 [ps]). Whereas the Rg values for remaining structures Cx2 wild-type, Cz2 wild-type and Cz2 mutated sequences remain relatively stable.

To compare the solvation properties of wild types and mutants, the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) was calculated from the MD trajectories using the Shrake-Rupley algorithm.74

Taking into consideration only the ‘interface’ part of the system SASA values are converged for all the WT cases. They remained almost constant, not showing any significant changes along the trajectories. Mean values of SASA Cx2 wild-type 0.30 ± 0.02 nm2 and Cz2 wild-type 0.28 ± 0.01 nm2 in mutated systems starting value of SASA is near to the values 2 observed for sequences not mutated (Cx2 wild-type 0.29 nm2, Cz2 wild-type 0.29 nm2, Cx2 mutated 0.35 nm2 and Cz2 mutated 0.38 nm2) but as the simulation is progressing value of SASA increases and almost doubles (between 2500 – 5000 ps) in mutated ones (Cx2 mutated 0.66 nm2, Cz2 mutated 0.79 nm2) after which the value of SASA for Cx2 mutated drops to 0.55 ± 0.03 nm2 and oscillates around this value throughout the remainder of the simulation, while Cz2 mutated decreases only by 0.09 ± 0.02 nm2 in the same period.

SASA for the WT systems remains stable throughout the simulation with values of approximately 7.5 nm2. The starting SASA for the mutated systems is similar to the WT systems. The Cz2 SASA increases to 20 nm2 where it remains for 40 ns and then rises to almost 30 nm2 where it stays for the rest of the simulation. The Cx2 increases up to 25 nm2, then fluctuates between 20 and 25 nm2 for the remainder of the trajectory. This indicates that the mutants have a greater SASA compared with their WT, with Cz2 having the largest SASA.

In this experiment we selected the optimal mutation that would destabilise Cz2 and does not destabilise Cx2. As seen in Figure 8C–D some influence of mutations on Cx2 was unavoidable but this effect is to weak to fully destabilize the Cx2 structure.

Finally, to illuminate the mutation effects on the local structural perturbations, we have also calculated the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) for Aβ 9–40 residues for the same four cases discussed above: Cx2 wild-type, Cz2 wild-type, Cx2 mutated and Cz2 mutated. Figure 9 shows the calculated RMSF values per residue for the whole period of MD simulations of Aβ 9–40 infinite fibril segments. The corresponding secondary structure regions of the Aβ 9–40 peptides are highlighted on the bottom of the figure in the color strip using a similar color-coding used as in the other figures above (i.e., the N-terminal: red, C-terminal: blue, turn: green).

The RMSF distributions shown in Figure 9 present distinctive features characteristic for Aβ 9–40. Specifically, the plots reveal regions with suppressed backbone fluctuations, residues from 25 to 28, which coincide with the formation of stable turn structures. It is also observed that, in general, fluctuations of particular residues become reversed when the mutation is applied to the system. The Cz2 structure fluctuates more compared to its wild-type whereas Cx2 is significantly more stable compared to its original. Furthermore, in the simulation of Cz2 mutated for all sequence positions, the RMSF has the biggest value with the overall average of 5.34 ± 0.26 nm and with peak value 5.85 ± 0.26 nm at residue 26. The average RMSF for remaining complexes are respectively: Cx2 mutated 3.71 ± 0.42 nm, Cx2 wild-type 4.41 ± 0.59 nm and Cz2 wild-type 4.66 ± 0.03 nm This shows that for Cx2 sequence mutated there is a significant decrease in fluctuations compared to the Cx2 WT sequence, by an average value of 0.7 nm with the greatest difference of 2.01 nm in the case of residue Aβ 26.

The relatively large RMSF of Cz2 mutated for all residues with exceptionally large value in the turn region indicate that Cz2 mutated is unstable and that its initial fibril conformation is stray. For the others structures, the turn region exhibits much smaller fluctuations. The Cx2 mutated is characterized by the most minor variations which indicates that introduced mutation additionally stabilize this structure. The Cx2 wild-type has larger fluctuations than Cz2 wild-type as the antiparallel models are more favored than the parallel conformations.75

Conclusions

It becomes crucial as a treatment and intervention strategy in the AD to develop molecular compounds that will inhibit amyloid formation, or decrease preformed aggregates thus reducing the amyloid load and alleviating the progression of the disease. To address this issue, here we have demonstrated the possibility to identify the sets of minimal mutations to selectively destabilize fibrillar amyloid structures using the well documented Cx2 and Cx2 conformations as a template.31,37,38

Drawing inspiration from erstwhile experimental studies, we developed a computational approach showing for the first time that by using several different types of statistical contact potentials (which have only partial accuracy on their own) allows us to obtain an efficient screening and accurate and identification of minimal sequence mutations.

As a plausible mechanism of disassembly for the specific Aβ fibril, we showed that the mutations disrupt the specific native conformation by rendering the fibril more solvent accessible, without causing at the same time a structurally distorting effect in cases where mutations are stabilizing.

We have, thus, explored the use of several contact potentials for the efficient identification of minimal sequence mutations that could enhance the stability of specific fibril structures while simultaneously destabilizing competing topologies, controlling thus the amount of structural polymorphism in a rational may. We found that different types of contact potentials while having only partial accuracy on their own, lead to similar results regarding ranking the compatibility of WT and mutated amyloid sequences with different fibril morphologies. Interestingly, our ‘CP crowdsourcing’ approach leads to a likely cancelation of errors due to the limited accuracy of individual main types of CPs, and allow us to predict effectively the relative stabilities of amyloid structures with mutated sequences. This property allows exhaustive screening and assessment of possible mutations and the identification of minimal consensus mutations that could stabilize fibrils with the desired topology at the expense of another; a prediction that is further validated using atomistic molecular dynamics with explicit water molecules.

We applied this two-step multiscale (i.e., residue and atomistic-level) approach to predict and validate mutations that could bias either parallel or anti-parallel packing in the core Alzheimer’s Aβ 9–40 amyloid fibril models based on solid-state NMR experiments.31

Although there is a significant number of studies of naturally occurring mutations (often accompanied by corresponding crystal structures), with the cases of Iowa,76 Flemish77 or Arctic mutations78 being of substantial attention, to our knowledge, there are only two natural mutations occuring in the region of interest, G37G79 and G38S,80 which do not appear to have any noticeable influence on the fibril structures. Interestingly, these two mutations also do not appear as significantly ranked candidates in the results of our analysis.

Interestingly, besides shedding new light on the molecular origins of the structural polymorphism in WT Aβ fibrils, our approach could also lead to efficient tools for assisting future experimental approaches for amyloid fibril determination, and for the development of biomarkers or drugs aimed at interfering with the stability of amyloid fibrils, as well as for the future design of amyloid fibrils with a controlled, reduced level of structural polymorphism.

Figure 1: Schematic representation of a dimeric region (N-terminal, red, and C-terminal, blue) separated by a turn region (green). Thus dimeric protofilament models can have either (A) parallel C-terminal beta-sheets (i.e., with Cx2 symmetry if the beta sheet regions are aligned through a 180°rotation around the x-axis), or (B) antiparallel beta-sheet orientations (i.e., with Cz2 symmetry, where the fibril is aligned through a 180°rotation around the z-axis). (C) The sequence of the Aβ1–40 peptide. To discriminate between these two topologies, we study the fibril stability in response to mutations at the interface between the two C-terminal b-strands (cyan), with the goal to design minimally mutated sequences that would maximize the difference instabilities between the two Cx2 and Cz2 topologies.

Figure 2: Contact potential energy distributions of all mutations with use of MJ96, MJ99, HL, SJKG, BT contact potentials, respectively for the Cx2 (A, C, E, G, I) and Cz2 (B, D, F, H, J) systems. Green bars indicate the position of the unaltered, wild-type (WT) sequence in relation to all mutations.

Figure 3: Differences (Δz) between standard scores calculated for Cz2 and Cx2 fibril structures, for the same mutations, and for five different statistical potentials. N is the total number of mutations. The standard scores values shown were averaged over the top 20 results in our exhaustive mutation screening calculation. Significant Δz values require at least 2 mutations, while the WT sequence (N = 0) present similar standard scores for all contact potentials used.

Figure 4: The initial model of the Aβ protofilament system with an infinitely-long topology (i.e., due to periodic boundaries). The system is replicated periodically along the fibril z-axis using a simulation box (outlined in cyan) of a size commensurate with an integer number of backbone hydrogen bonds, and solvated using explicit water molecules. The color-coding for secondary structure elements is the same as the one used in previous figures.

Figure 5: The sequence of the Aβ1–40 peptide, with color coding corresponding to the N-terminal (red), C-terminal (blue), turn (green), and disordered (black) regions in the fibril structure. Mutation having the highest average score for destabilizing Cx2 is highlighted in cyan.

Figure 6: Probing the effects of stabilizing mutations with atomistic MD simulations. Initial structures with mutations G33V (red side chains), G37K (blue side chains) V39E (orange side chains) are illustrated for both Cx2 (top: A, B, C, and D) and Cz2 (bottom: E, F, G, and H) topologies after MD simulations performed for (A and E) 1 ns, (B and F) 40 ns, (C and G) 225 ns, and (D and H) 325 ns.

Figure 7: Distances between the residues 36 and 32 (i.e., defined as distances between the center of mass of the heavy atoms in the side chains) that is located in the middle of the C-terminal β-strands but on different neighboring peptides in the fibril structure, shown for four atomistic systems of WT and mutated fibrils with and topologies.

Figure 8: Time evolution during atomistic MD simulations of (A) fraction of native contacts, Q, (B) root mean square deviation (backbone), (C) radius of gyration, and (D) solvent accessible surface area calculated for the same four systems as in Figure 7.

Figure 9: Root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) per residue calculated for the whole period of MD simulations of Aβ 9–40 infinite fibril segments. The corresponding secondary structure regions of the Aβ 9–40 peptides are highlighted on the bottom of the figure (with color coding used as in Figure 1, N-terminal: red, C-terminal: blue, turn: green).
