We examined the contribution of candidate genes for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) on Chromosome 21 and other chromosomes to differences in Aβ peptide levels in a cohort of adults with DS, a population at high risk for AD. Participants were 254 non-demented adults with Down syndrome, 30–78 years of age. Genomic DNA was genotyped using an Illumina GoldenGate custom array. We used linear regression to examine differences in levels of Aβ peptides associated with the number of risk alleles, adjusting for age, sex, level of intellectual disability, race/ethnicity and the presence of the APOE ε4 allele. For Aβ42 levels, the strongest gene-wise association was found for a SNP on CAHLM1; for Aβ40 levels the strongest gene-wise associations were found for SNPs in IDE and SOD1, while the strongest gene-wise associations with levels of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio were found for SNPs in SORCS1. Broadly classified, variants in these genes may influence APP processing (CALHM1, IDE), vesicular trafficking (SORCS1), and response to oxidative stress (SOD1).

1. INTRODUCTION

Amyloid β (Aβ) plays a critical role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid β peptides Aβ40 and Aβ42 are the two major species generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage by β and γ secretases of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Selkoe, 2001). Brain levels of Aβ42 increase early in the development of dementia, (Cummings and Cotman, 1995, Naslund, et al., 2000) and studies of Aβ peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have consistently shown that declining or low levels of Aβ42 and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and high concentrations of tau in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with higher brain Aβ load (Fagan, et al., 2006, Fagan, et al., 2009, Fagan, et al., 2007) and predict conversion to AD (Blennow and Hampel, 2003, Hansson, et al., 2007, Jack, et al., 2013). Studies of plasma Aβ have shown less consistent relationships to risk of AD than studies of CSF Aβ and inconsistent correlations between plasma and CSF Aβ peptides (Toledo, et al., 2013). Elevated plasma Aβ42 levels have been proposed as a risk factor related to both age and risk for AD. Thus, although deposition of Aβ42 in brain tissue is unlikely to result directly from increased plasma levels, both brain and plasma levels may reflect a general alteration in Aβ processing and individual differences in plasma Aβ42 peptide level may serve as a biological marker of risk, sensitive to the development and progression of AD.

Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology and clinical dementia, which has been attributed to triplication and overexpression of the gene for amyloid precursor protein, APP, located on chromosome 21 (Head, et al. 2012), which leads to elevated levels of Aβ peptides from an early age (Conti, et al., 2010, Head, et al., 2011, Mehta, et al., 1998, Schupf, et al., 2001, Teller, et al., 1996, Tokuda, et al., 1997). In adults with DS, high initial levels of plasma Aβ42, are associated with increased risk for AD (Coppus, et al., 2012, Head, et al., 2011, Jones, et al., 2009, Matsuoka, et al., 2009, Schupf, et al., 2007, Schupf, et al., 2001). However, there are large individual differences in initial Aβ peptide levels and a wide range of age at onset of AD within this population, suggesting a more complex underlying mechanism and a role for additional risk factors.

The factors that influence individual differences in plasma Aβ peptides are not well understood. Genetic and environmental risk factors may influence the development of AD by increasing production of Aβ or by reduced clearance or excess deposition of Aβ. Compared with individuals without DS, adults with DS could also be at increased risk for AD through triplication and overexpression of genes on chromosome 21 other than APP, and genes on other chromosomes may modify this risk. Multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified potential genetic pathways for AD (Bertram and Tanzi, 2012, Hollingworth, et al., 2011, Jun, et al., 2010, Lambert, et al., 2009a, Lambert, et al., 2013, Naj, et al., 2011) but only a few studies have examined their relation to Aβ levels (Bali, et al., 2012, Chouraki, et al., 2014, Kim, et al., 2011, Miners, et al., 2010, Reitz, et al., 2011b). Reasoning that individuals with DS may be a population group with increased sensitivity for revealing such pathways, in this study we examined the relation of candidate genes for AD to baseline levels of Aβ peptides, Aβ42, Aβ40 and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in older adults with DS. The aim was to identify genetic factors associated with individual differences in level of Aβ peptides which might act as biomarkers of risk for AD.

2. METHODS

2.1 Study population

The study sample included 254 members of a community-based cohort of adults with confirmed DS, non-demented at their initial examination. Dementia status at baseline was classified using data from all available sources reviewed during a consensus conference. Following recommendations of the AAMR-IASSID Working Group for the Establishment of Criteria for the Diagnosis of Dementia in Individuals with Developmental Disability (Aylward, et al., 1997, Burt and Aylward, 2000). Participants were classified into 2 groups:

1) dementia, if there was a history of progressive memory loss, disorientation, and functional decline over a period of at least 1 year and if there were no other medical or psychiatric conditions that might result in or mimic dementia present (e.g., untreated hypothyroidism, stroke) and 2) without dementia, if they were without cognitive or functional decline based on performance on neuropsychological assessments referenced to level of intellectual disability tested in young adulthood, review of medical records and interviews with informants (Silverman et al., 2004). Among participants who were non-demented at baseline, we analyzed the relation of SNPS in candidate genes to Aβ levels using plasma from the baseline visit (Schupf, et al., 2010) to identify genetics factors associated with individual difference in levels of abeta peptides which might act as biomarkers of risk. All individuals were 31 years of age and older (range 31–78) and resided in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey or northern Pennsylvania. Participants were recruited with the help of state and voluntary service provider agencies and were eligible for inclusion in the present study if: (a) a family member or correspondent provided informed consent, (b) he or she either provided consent or assent indicating willingness to participate, and (c) he or she was willing and able to provide blood samples. 76.4% of the study sample was female. The high frequency of females in the study sample reflects a focus in our research program on the relationship between menopause and risk for dementia among women with Down syndrome. Recruitment, informed consent and study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Columbia University Medical Center, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

2.2 Clinical Assessment

Assessments included evaluations of cognition and functional abilities, behavioral/psychiatric conditions and health status. Cognitive function was evaluated with a test battery designed for use with individuals varying widely in their initial levels of intellectual functioning, as previously described (Silverman, et al., 2004). Structured interviews were conducted with caregivers to collect information on adaptive behavior and medical history. Past and current medical records were reviewed for all participants.

2.3 Plasma Aββ β42 and Aβ ββ40

Participants were asked to provide a 10 ml venous non-fasting blood sample (K2EDTA lavender-top tube) at each assessment cycle. Blood draws were done between 10 am and 4 pm. Plasma levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 were measured blind to clinical status using a combination of monoclonal antibody 6E10 (specific to an epitope present on 1–16 amino acid residues of Aβ) and rabbit antisera R165 (vs. Aβ42) and R162 (vs. Aβ40) in a double antibody sandwich ELISA as previously described. (Mayeux, et al., 2003, Mehta, et al., 1998, Schupf, et al., 2007). The detection limit for these assays was 5 pg/ml for Aβ40 and 10 pg/ml for Aβ42. Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels from each sample were measured twice using separate aliquots. Reliability between measurements was substantial for both peptides (r= .93. and r= .97 for Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively, p&lt; .001), and the mean of the two measurements was used in statistical analyses.

2.4 Apolipoprotein E genotypes

Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping employed standard PCR-RFLP methods using Hha1 (CfoI) digestion of an APOE genomic PCR product spanning the polymorphic (cys/arg) sites at codons 112 and 158. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to assess and document the restriction fragment sizes (Hixson and Vernier, 1990). Participants were classified according to the presence or absence of an APOE ε4 allele.

Selection of Candidate Genes

An initial set of candidate genes included the top candidate genes from the ALZGENE database (http://www.alzgene.org) and additional positional candidate genes from published genome wide linkage and association studies. We used SNAP (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearch.php) to identify genes within the candidate regions. This process generated six candidates on chromosome 21 and 41 genes on other chromosomes. Candidate genes on chromosome 21 included the genes for amyloid precursor protein (APP), β amyloid converting enzyme-2 (BACE2), the Down syndrome critical region-1 (DSCR1), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), the astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor S100β, and CU/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD-1). Additional candidate genes were on chromosomes 1, 2, 6–11, 15, 17, 19, 20 and X (See Supplemental Table 1 for the full list of genes). Figure 1 provides an overview of SNP selection and SNP analysis performed in the 2-stage candidate gene study.

2.5 SNP Selection

We genotyped each gene with a sufficient number of SNPs to provide dense coverage (r2~0.8), and the selected SNPs had a relatively high minor allele frequency (MAF&gt;0.15). To identify tag SNPs in these genes, we applied the TAGGER program (de Bakker, 2009) to a Caucasian population available from the HapMap dataset (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). In addition, we used SNAP (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearch.php) to check LD patterns across the genic region to ensure that the coverage was comprehensive. For chromosome 21, 263 SNPS from the six genes had a median minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.30 and a median inter-marker distance of 1,914.5 base pairs. For chromosomes other than 21, 1,110 SNPS, exclusive of APOE, from 41 genes, had a median MAF of 0.30 and a median inter-marker distance of 1,955 base pairs. We present top strands generated from the Illumina customized platform.

2.6 SNP Genotyping: Customized SNP array in trisomic samples

Genomic DNA was genotyped using an Illumina GoldenGate custom array. Clustering and genotype calling of Chromosome 21 SNPS and non-Chr21 SNPs was performed using GenomeStudio genotyping module v1.8 which supports polyploidy loci. For SNPs on chromosome 21, the custom cluster option in GenomeStudio genotyping module v1.8 was used to specify 4 clusters and the custom GType was used to display genotype calls for polyploidy loci (AAA, AAB, ABB, or BBB). All genotype calls were inspected manually by viewing SNP graph cluster plots. Figure 2 shows a typical cluster plot for one of the trisomy SNPs tested (rs2830054). The minor allele was always coded as the risk allele.

2.7 Quality Control Assessment

Prior to allelic association analysis, we first checked the quality of SNP genotyping. Quality scores were determined from allele cluster definitions for each SNP as determined by the Illumina GenomeStudio Genotyping Module version 3.0 and the combined intensity data from 100% of study samples. Genotype calls with a quality score (Gencall value) of ≥0.25 were considered acceptable. For chromosome 21, the average call rate was 98%. We dropped SNPs with a call rate &lt;90% (n=23) or SNPs that did not produce genotypes (n=9). For chromosomes other than 21, the call rate for SNPs was 99%. A total of 11 SNPs were dropped because they had GenTrain scores below threshold or had a call rate of &lt; 98%. After the filtering process, we analyzed 231 SNPs on chromosome 21 and 1099 SNPs from chromosomes other than 21. As a further test of assay reliability, 15 randomly selected samples were genotyped in duplicate. The concordance rates for genotyped SNPs in these samples ranged from 91.8 to 100% for Chr 21 SNPs and from 95.2 to 99.6 for non-Chr 21 SNPs. We then conducted additional quality control (QC) assessments using PLINK (Purcell, et al., 2007). We excluded SNPs with the following characteristics: missing genotyping rate &gt;5%; minimum allele frequency &lt;1%; Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) test [27] at a p-value &lt;0.000001.

2.8. Population stratification

To adjust for population stratification, we applied the multidimensional scaling (MDS) method as implemented in PLINK. Using all available SNPs that survived the QC process, genetic similarity across individuals was estimated by computing identity by state (IBS). To anchor and cross-check against individuals with known ethnic background, we also included whites (n=165), Africans (n=165) and Asians (170) from the Hapmap database (www.hapmap.org). This analysis generated three distinct racial/ethnic clusters. These clusters were included in the multivariate model to account for ancestry.

2.9. Covariates

Covariates included age, sex, level of intellectual disability, race/ethnicity clusters from MDS analysis, and the presence or absence of an APOE ε4 allele. Level of intellectual disability was classified into two groups based on IQ scores obtained before onset of cognitive impairment due to onset of CMI or dementia: mild/moderate (IQ 35–70) and severe/profound (IQ &lt;35).

2.10. Statistical analyses

Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of potential confounders, including age, sex, race/ethnicity clusters, level of intellectual disability and the presence of an APOE ε4 allele to peptide levels. To minimize penalties for multiple testing, we conducted a two-stage analysis to identify SNPS that are associated with levels of amyloid Aβ42 and AB40 (Figure 1). In Stage 1 (screening stage), using PLINK, we pruned SNPs to achieve a variance inflation factor (VIF) of 1.43, which is equivalent to a pairwise r2&lt;0.3. Using PLINK, we evaluated the allelic association between a SNP and Aβ42, Aβ40 and Aβ42/Aβ40 levels using a linear regression model after adjusting for confounders. An additive model was used based on the number of risk alleles. An empirical p-value was computed using 10,000 permutations. In Stage 2 (fine mapping stage), we focused on candidate genes where at least one SNP met an empirical p-value &lt;0.05. To perform the fine mapping analysis, we included all SNPs that were genotyped within that gene. We repeated the linear regression model and, in addition, we computed adjusted p-values to correct for multiple testing, as proposed by Benjamini and colleagues (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995, Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001). The R statistical package (http://www.r-project.org/) was used to compute adjusted p-values. For the three most promising genes from the single point analysis (CALMH1 and Aβ42, IDE and Aβ40, SORCS1 and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), we used PLINK to conduct haplotype analysis with a 3-SNP sliding windows approach to identify contiguous regions with significant association.

3. RESULTS

3.1

Valid genotypes were obtained for 254 participants for chromosome 21 genes, and for 219 participants for non-chromosome 21 genes. The demographic characteristics of the two subsets of participants were comparable. For both subsets, mean age was 49.6 years, 76.4% of the study sample was female, 56.7% had a mild or moderate level of intellectual disability while the remainder had severe intellectual disability, and 90.6% of the sample was Caucasian. The APOE ε4 allele frequency was 11.3% (Table 1). Mean levels of Aβ peptides were also comparable across both sets. Mean Aβ42 level was 28.2 pg/ml (8.0–132.4) for the 254 participants with genotypes on Chromosome 21 and 27.3 pg/ml (8.0–110.7) for the 219 participants with genotypes on other chromosomes. Mean Aβ40 level was 156.0 pg/ml (24.3–491.4) and the mean Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio was 0.21 pg/ml (0.047–1.15) for both subsets of participants.

For all participants, level of intellectual disability, sex, race/ethnicity components and the presence of an APOE ε4 allele were not related to baseline levels of Aβ42, Aβ40 or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Aβ40 levels increased with age (r= .135, P=.031), while levels of Aβ42 and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio decreased with age (r= −.17, p=.008 and r= −.16, p=.009, respectively).

3.2. Aβ42

Stage 1 screening based on tagSNPs identified SNPs in RUNX1 and DSCR1 on chromosome 21 genes (Table 2), and identified SNPS in MTHFR, MTHFD1L, RELN, CALHM1, SORCS1, SORL1, ACAN, and PCDH11X on non-chromosome 21 genes that were associated with Aβ42 levels at empirical p-value&lt;0.05 (Table 2). In Stage 2 fine mapping for genes on Chromosome 21, none of the SNPs for Aβ42 level achieved the adjusted gene-wiser empirical p-values using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995, Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001) (Table 2). In Stage 2 fine mapping for non-chromosome 21 genes, two SNPs (rs177736358 and rs755577) that are ~2.5kb apart on the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) gene were significant after correcting for multiple testing, and two SNPs (rs11814111 and rs8878183) on SORCS1 had adjusted p-values of 0.066, approaching the threshold of 0.05, while SNPs on the other non-chromosome 21 genes failed to achieve the adjusted gene-level empirical p-values. (Table 2).

3.3. Aβ40

Stage 1 screening based on tagSNPs identified SNPs in the APP, SOD1, DSCR1, and BACE2 chromosome 21 genes (Table 3) and SNPs in the BIN1, RELN, DAPK1, IDE, ACAN, LDLR and PCDH11X non-chromosome 21 genes that were associated with Aβ40 levels at empirical p-value&lt;0.05 (Table 3). In Stage 2 fine mapping, 3 SNPs in the SOD1 gene that were significant at the p-value of 0.05 for single point analysis barely missed the threshold p=0.05 for significance (p=0.0529) in the gene-wise analysis correcting for multiple testing, but none of the SNPS in APP, DSCR1, or BACE2 chromosome 21 genes achieved significance in the gene-wise analysis (Table 2). 12 of 13 SNPs in the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) gene, spanning 20kb, remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing while SNPS in the other non-chromosome 21 genes did not achieve gene-wise empirical p-values.(Table 3).

3.4 Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio

In Stage 1 screening, SNPs in the APP, RUNX1 and BACE2 chromosome 21 genes (Table 4) and SNPs in the DAPK1, SORCS1, SORL1 and LDLR non-chromosome 21 genes reached the threshold of 0.05 for single point analysis, and were associated with variation in the level of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (Table 4). In Stage 2 fine mapping, the contiguous seven SNPs for the sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1) gene located on 10q23-q25, which were strongly associated with the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in Stage 1 screening, remained significant after multiple testing adjustment (0.0337&lt;p&lt;0.0394) while SNPS in the other genes did not achieve statistical significance.(Table 4).

3.5 Haplotype analysis

To further characterize candidate regions that may harbor putative variants, we then performed a 3-mer sliding window haplotype analysis for the 3 promising candidate genes with the strongest support for association, CALHM1 for Aβ42, IDE for Aβ40, and SORCS1 for Aβ42/Aβ40. As shown in Supplemental Tables 2–4, multiple haplotypes anchoring on the SNPs that were significant from the single point gene-wise analysis strengthened the support for association.

4. DISCUSSION

We found significant SNP-wise associations with Aβ peptide levels for SNPs on 17 genes of 47 candidate genes examined, and three genes (CALHM1, IDE, and SORCS1) remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. These 47 candidate genes were selected from previous genome wide linkage, association and expression studies of AD in the DS and general populations. Our results extend previous findings of a relationship between SNPs in APP, PICALM, SORLI1, BACE1, ALDH18A and RUNX1 and risk of AD in adults with DS (Jones, et al., 2013, Lee, et al., 2007, Margallo-Lana, et al., 2004, Patel, et al., 2011) to include examination of plasma beta amyloid peptides as a critical risk factor for AD in DS, and employing a wider range of SNPs and genes. We found significant gene-wise associations with Aβ peptide levels for SNPs in 3 genes: CALHM1, IDE and SORCS1. For Aβ42 levels, two SNPs (rs755577 and rs17736358) in CAHLM1 were associated at the gene-wise level. For Aβ40 levels the strongest gene-wise associations were found for a set of SNPs on IDE, located 94,217038 to 94335799 bp. These were represented by a set of contiguous 3-mer haplotypes with empirical p-values ranging from 0.00015 to 0.00063 (See Supplement table 3). As an external confirmation, the 2-stage meta-analysis of the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) dataset reported that rs2421942 was significantly associated with AD. For levels of the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, the strongest gene-wise associations were found for SNPs in SORCS1, located in the region encompassing 108,479,649 to 108,647,761bp. Although the exact same set of SNPs were associated with AD in the (ADGC) meta-analysis, rs12248379 (chr10:108562008) (p=0.00534) overlapped with haplotype A-C-C that was significant in our dataset (p=0.00329). Broadly classified, variants in these genes may influence APP processing (CALHM1, IDE) and vesicular trafficking (SORCS1), neurodevelopmental processes, response to oxidative stress (SOD1).

Processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by cleavage by β and γ secretases to generate Aβ peptides is central to the pathogenesis of AD (Vardarajan, et al., 2012). Missense mutations in the gene for APP, which increase the proteolytic conversion of APP into the fribillogenic Aβ42 peptide, have been shown to lead to early onset of AD (Goate, et al., 1991, Guerreiro, et al., Rogaeva, et al., 2007, Scheuner, et al.,1996, Younkin, 1997), but less work has been done on the relation of common SNPS in APP to age at onset, risk of AD, or individual differences in Aβ peptide levels (Benitez, et al., 2013, Chapman, et al., 2013, Kimura, et al., 2007, Shulman, et al., 2013). Several, but not all, studies have found a relationship between high initial levels of Aβ42 and subsequent development of AD, both among adults with Down syndrome (Coppus, et al., 2012, Head, et al., 2011, Jones, et al., 2009, Matsuoka, et al., 2009, Schupf, et al., 2007, Schupf, et al., 2001) and in the general population (Blasko, et al., 2010, Mayeux, et al., 2003, Mayeux, et al., 1999, Pomara, et al., 2005, Schupf, et al., 2008). However, large GWAS studies of AD have not found an association between SNPs in APP and late onset AD (LOAD) (Bertram and Tanzi, 2012, Hollingworth, et al., 2011, Lambert, et al., 2009b, Naj, et al., 2011). A recent GWAS meta-analysis of plasma Abeta peptide concentrations in nondemented elderly also failed to find SNPs on APP that were associated with Aβ levels, although several suggestive loci were found on other genes; the gene most strongly associated with Aβ42 was CTXN3 (cortexin3), involved in Aβ42 secretion (Chouraki, et al., 2014). In our cohort of adults with DS, we did find SNPs on APP that were significantly associated with Aβ peptides in the single point analysis; however, after correcting for multiple testing at the gene-wise level, those SNPs were no longer significant. This may reflect the very high level of Aβ that is found among all adults with DS (Conti, et al., 2010, Head, et al., 2011, Mehta, et al., 1998, Schupf, et al., 2001, Teller, et al., 1996, Tokuda, et al., 1997): it may be that processing and clearance rather than generation of Aβ are more important factors associated with the individual differences we have examined. It is also possible, given the results of the single point analysis, that studies of SNPs in APP, using a much larger sample than we were able to study in this paper, will identify SNPs in APP associated with individual differences in levels of Aβ peptides.

We found that the A allele in rs755577 and the G allele in rs17736358 on CALHM1 were associated with individual differences in Aβ42 levels. However, this SNP is located 5.8kb and 8.3kb away from rs2986017 the SNP which has been associated with increased risk and age at onset in some (Boada, et al., 2010, Dreses-Werringloer, et al., 2008, Lambert, et al., 2010), but not all (Beecham, et al., 2009, Bertram, et al., 2008, Minster, et al., 2009) prior studies. CALHM1 is expressed in the hippocampus and encodes a calcium channel involved in APP processing. The CALHM1 rs2986017 polymorphism has been proposed to increase Aβ levels by interfering with CALHM1-mediated Ca(2+) permeability (Dreses-Werringloer, et al., 2008). Replication in a larger dataset will be required to confirm this finding.

We found SNPs on IDE (insulin degrading enzyme) that were associated with individual differences in Aβ40 levels. IDE shares insulin and Aβ as substrates (Kurochkin and Goto, 1994). Consistent with our findings, IDE is up-regulated in amyloid plaques, (Bernstein, et al., 1999) and lower expression of IDE is found in the hippocampus in brains of elders with LOAD who are APOE ε4 positive (Cook, et al., 2003, Qiu and Folstein, 2006), and in persons with mild cognitive impairment (Zhao, et al., 2007), who are at highest risk for LOAD. Lower IDE expression has also been found to correlate with higher levels of cellular Aβ42 associated with PS1 mutations in cellular models. Several have found an association between a variant on IDE and plasma Aβ42 or Aβ40 levels (Carrasquillo, et al., 2010, Reitz, et al., 2012). However, data on the relation of the IDE locus with AD is conflicting. Some studies showed no association between the IDE locus and LOAD (Abraham, et al., 2001, Boussaha, et al., 2002, Nowotny, et al., 2005, Ozturk, et al., 2006, Sakai, et al., 2004), while other studies have found an association (Carrasquillo, et al., 2010, Vepsalainen, et al., 2007, Zuo and Jia, 2009).

SORCS1 is a member of the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) domain-containing receptor protein family. VPS10 receptors are involved with APP trafficking and can influence APP processing and Aβ production through linking APP to the endosomal retromer complex and access to secretases that cleave APP (Lane, et al., 2010, Lane, et al., 2013). SNPS in SORCS1 have been associated with increased risk for late onset AD (Reitz, et al., 2011a, Rogaeva, et al., 2007) and also influence Aβ peptide levels where over-expression of SORCS1 reduces γ-secretase activity and Aβ levels, and SORCS1 suppression increases γ-secretase processing of APP and Aβ levels (Rogaeva, et al., 2007).

An interesting connection between IDE and SORCS1, the candidate genes with strongest signals in chromosome 10 in our study, is that both may be related to hyperinsulinemia and type 2 diabetes, potential important risk factors for LOAD. (Cheng, et al., 2011, Luchsinger, et al., 2004) Certain IDE genotypes are related to a higher risk of diabetes (Fakhrai-Rad, et al., 2000, Karamohamed, et al., 2003, Kwak, et al., 2008, Rudovich, et al., 2009), although the contribution of IDE to diabetes is controversial,(Groves, et al., 2003) and other studies have found no relationship.(Florez, et al., 2006, Qin and Jia, 2008). SORCS1 may also affect insulin levels and the risk of diabetes (Clee, et al., 2006, Goodarzi, et al., 2007, Lane, et al., 2010). Diabetes and insulin resistance are also more prevalent in persons with Down syndrome (Fonseca, et al., 2005). Thus, the connection of IDE, SORCS1, insulin resistance and diabetes, Aβ and AD in Down syndrome requires further investigation.

Several genes on chromosome 21 are involved in inflammation and are overexpressed in DS, including APP, superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), Ets-2 transcription factors, Down Syndrome Critical Region 1 (DSCR1) stress-inducible factor, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE-2), and S100β. In this study, SNPS in SOD1 were associated with individual differences in levels of Aβ40, but not with Aβ42 or the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and SOD1 has been implicated in neurodegenerative processes (Lott, et al., 2006). Adults with DS overexpress SOD1 and show increased free radical–mediated oxidative damage (Markesbery and Lovell, 2007, Reynolds and Cutts, 1993). Increased SOD1 expression has been found in degenerating neurons in the brain of adults with DS (Furuta, et al., 1995). The rate of production of Aβ from APP may be increased in the presence of this type of oxidative damage (Dickinson and Singh, 1993, Lott and Head, 2001), where membrane damage secondary to lipoperoxidation allows abnormal cleavage of the protein (Singth and Dickinson, 2006). Zis and colleagues (Zis, et al., 2012) observed in a longitudinal study that higher SOD levels were positively associated with memory performance over a period of 4 years in 26 adults with Down syndrome, and suggested that these enzymes may have protective, antioxident effects. Further work will need to be conducted to determine the contribution of SOD levels to onset of dementia in adults with DS. Further work will need to be conducted to determine the contribution of SOD levels to onset of dementia in adults with DS.

In sum, recent GWAS and meta-analyses of genes associated with risk for AD have identified SNPS associated with several major pathways, including amyloid production, lipid/cholesterol metabolism, immune response and inflammation, vesicular trafficking/synaptic function and neurodevelopment. Our study examined the relation of candidate genes for AD to individual differences in Aβ peptide levels among unaffected adults with Down syndrome. We found significant associations with candidate genes in several of these pathways but the strongest associations were related to Aβ processing, neuro-developmental processes, and oxidative damage. These findings support the hypothesis that individual differences in Aβ processing or deposition, distinct from overexpression of APP, may act as an initial step in the pathogenesis of AD.

Our study has several limitations. Timing of blood draws was not specifically controlled for. Blood draws were done between 10 am and 4 pm. We believe that this diurnal variation is unlikely to alter the relation between Aβ levels and SNPs, since timing was randomly distributed and variations would be expected to lead to non-differential bias. However, this is a potential source of increased variability in our Aβ measures.

Not all the genes associated with individual differences in Aβ peptide levels in our cohort of adults with DS have been confirmed in recent large GWAS and meta-analyses as associated with risk for AD in the general population. Our study is limited by a relatively small sample size, but examined the role of these genes in a very high risk group that is characterized by early onset of AD and by especially high levels of Aβ peptides. These findings may therefore help to clarify pathways that contribute to the development of AD, both in adults with DS and within the broader population.

Highlights

Adults with DS overexpress APP, have increased levels of Aβ peptides and are at high risk for AD.

The relation of variants in genes on chromosome 21 and other chromosomes to Aβ peptide levels was examined.

Variants in CAHLM1, IDE, SOD1 and SORCS1 were related to differences in levels of Aβ2, Aβ40 and the ABβ2/Aβ40 ratio.

Variants influencing levels of Aβ peptides can provide insight into pathways active in the pathogenesis of AD in adults with DS.
