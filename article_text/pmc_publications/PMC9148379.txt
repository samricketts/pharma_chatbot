INTRODUCTION:

Pre-analytical sample handling might affect the results of Alzheimer’s blood-based biomarkers. We empirically tested variations of common blood collection and handling procedures.

METHODS:

We created sample sets that address the effect of blood collection tube type, and of EDTA plasma delayed centrifugation, centrifugation temperature, aliquot volume, delayed storage, and freeze-thawing. We measured Amyloid-β (Aβ)42 and 40 peptides with six assays, and Aβ oligomerization-tendency (OAβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP)699-711, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light (NfL), total tau (tTau) and phosphorylated (p)tau181.

RESULTS:

Collection tube type resulted in different values of all assessed markers. Delayed plasma centrifugation and storage affected Aβ and tTau. tTau was additionally affected by centrifugation temperature. The other markers were resistant to handling variations.

DISCUSSION:

We constructed a standardized operating procedure for plasma handling, to facilitate introduction of blood-based biomarkers into the research and clinical settings.

pmcBACKGROUND

Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have the potential to be implemented as non-invasive screening tools. Promising markers that reflect AD neuropathophysiological processes are amyloid-β (Aβ),1-9 (phosphorylated) tau,10-13 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)6,8,14-16 and neurofilament light (NfL).8,15-17 Particularly GFAP and NfL are also implicated in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as non-AD dementias, multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injury.14,18,19 Standardization of measurement across clinical trials and care settings will facilitate widespread adoption and implementation of blood-based biomarkers.

It took decades for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and (p)tau to be widely accepted as fluid biomarkers for AD,20,21 amongst others due to large variability in levels between and within laboratories.22,23 Variation has been partly mitigated by fully automated analytical instruments,24,25 and development of Certified Reference Materials to re-calibrate commercial assays to.26 Different procedures of sample handling in the pre-analytical phase, from body fluid collection until analysis, also caused variation.27 This was standardized by development of standardized operating procedure (SOP)s.28-31 It is conceivable that pre-analytical variations might also impact levels of the novel AD blood-based biomarkers.

A plasma sample handling SOP has been proposed,32 but this was not yet based on empirical evidence. Initial pre-analytical experiments showed that use of different anticoagulants resulted in different Aβ42,Aβ40, GFAP, NfL, t-Tau and p-Tau181 levels,33-35 and that Aβ levels might be unstable in EDTA blood pending centrifugation and after,33,35-37 while tTau and NfL appeared to be more stable but with some conflicting results.33,37-40 A comprehensive study of a broad range of pre-analytical factors on the wide portfolio of novel AD blood-based biomarkers is lacking. We aimed to establish an analyte-independent and technology-independent blood sample handling SOP based on empirical evidence.

METHODS

This study was a joint effort of the Standardization of Alzheimer’s Blood Biomarkers (SABB) workgroup of the Global Biomarker Standardization Consortium (GBSC) of the Alzheimer’s Association, which was launched in 2018 to bring together expertise from academia, government, and industry. In a stepwise approach, we 1) identified the breadth of variation in sample handling protocols applied by cohort studies and diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, 2) investigated the effect of the most common and most relevant pre-analytical sample handling differences on the different blood-based biomarkers in systematic experiments, and 3) generated a unified SOP.

Identification of pre-analytical sample handling variation between studies using inventories

We invited 42 GBSC members representing 30 organizations to fill out a survey detailing all steps of their pre-analytical sample handling protocols (19 variables; survey template in supplementary file 1). After reviewing, a next survey was sent to 48 GBSC members representing 32 organizations (template in supplementary file 2), inviting them to give priority rankings (scale 1(=highest)–5(=lowest)) to short-list the most relevant pre-analytical factors.

Generation of pre-analytical sample sets

At Amsterdam UMC, sample sets were prepared to mimic the extremes of the reported variations of the short-listed pre-analytical factors. Fresh blood was obtained from adults who presented at the Clinical Chemistry Department for a diagnostic blood draw for any disease. As reference condition, whole blood was centrifuged for 10min at 1,800xg at room temperature (RT), after standing 30min at RT. Subsequently, separated plasma (or serum) was aliquoted in 250μL portions in 0.5-mL polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Germany), and stored at −80°C. For the experimental conditions, these handling steps were systematically varied (detailed experimental protocols in supplementary file 3). 92 volunteers participated, contributing to n=10-12 inclusions per protocol, with ≤15 aliquots per condition.

The study was in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, and approved by the medical ethical committee of the VU University medical center (approval number: 2019.257–NL69123.029.19). All volunteers gave written informed consent to use their blood for research purposes. No demographic or clinical information was collected.

Sample measurements

Samples were shipped to eight laboratories for quantitative analysis using different platforms (detailed below). All measurements were performed according to lab protocols and/or manufacturers’ instructions. Sample handling from thawing until measurement is described in supplementary file 4.

Aβ42 and Aβ40 were measured at C2N Diagnostics’ CLIA-certified lab (Precivity-Aβ™, USA)using immunoprecipitation liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS),41 at the Shaw lab of University of Pennsylvania using Euroimmun ELISAs (Euroimmun, Germany) and at Araclon Biotech (Spain) using their ELISAs.42,43 Aβ42, Aβ40 and amyloid precursor protein (APP)669-711 were measured at the Hirtz lab with immunoprecipitation MALDI-TOF-MS, using a protocol slightly modified from Nakamura et al.1 Aβ42, Aβ40, NfL and GFAP were measured at the Quanterix lab (USA), with the pre-commercial Simoa Neurology 4-Plex E kit, and Aβ42, Aβ40 and total tau (tTau) were measured at the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory of Gothenburg University with the Simoa Human Neurology 3-Plex A kit (Quanterix). Aβ oligomerization tendency (OAβ) was measured at PeopleBio (Republic of Korea), using multimer detection system-OAβ test.7 Lastly, pTau181 was measured at Amsterdam UMC in duplicates with 4-fold automated sample dilution on the Simoa HDx analyzer using a Simoa prototype 2-step assay with AT270 (Thermofisher Scientific) as the capture and LRL (Eli Lilly and Company) as the detector antibody, which is according to the MSD set-up as published previously.44 We analytically validated this novel assay prior to use and accepted it to be fit for purpose, according to validation consensus guidelines.45

Data analysis

We applied Spearman’s correlation analysis to compare the raw blood biomarker values obtained in the reference conditions. Biomarker values obtained under experimental conditions were normalized against their reference condition (%recovery). We calculated group median %recovery per experimental condition. When the median changed &gt;10%, we considered this as a relevant (clinically significant) change. This arbitrary value was chosen to balance intra-assay variability inherent to fluid biomarker measurements (generally &lt;10%), with the observation that plasma Aβ42/40 is decreased by only 20% approximately in patients with AD compared to controls.9 Data were visualized using R version 1.1.463.

RESULTS

Pre-analytical variations across studies identified with inventories

Fifteen investigators representing nine cohorts, five companies and one experimental study filled out our pre-analytical sample handling survey. Results are summarized in table 1. No relevant variation was reported in sampling factors needle size, location of blood draw, plastic tubing or other tools used, tube collection order and tube filling volume. No variation was reported in preparation factor tube inversion or manipulation before centrifugation, and only little variation in storage factor freeze-thaw cycles. Much variation was reported in standing time from blood draw until centrifugation (longest: 30h), and from centrifugation to freezing (longest: 4h), during which 50% of the studies hold the tubes at RT and 50% hold the tubes cold.

The pre-analytical variables were ranked for priority for testing (average ratings in table 1). In general, variables with little variation were ranked lowest, and variables with much variation were ranked highest. Exceptions were collection tube type and freeze-thawing.

Effect of pre-analytical variation on the Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides

Aβ42 and Aβ40 were measured with two MS assays, two Simoa assays and two ELISAs. The absolute Aβ42, Aβ40 and Aβ42/40 values for each of the assays as measured in the non-mistreated reference conditions of the experimental sample sets (n=80 for each assay) are presented in supplementary file 4. All values were measured well above the assay’s lower limits of quantifications. In these reference samples, we observed moderate between-assay correlations of most of the Aβ42 values (range Spearman’s ρ: 0.3–0.6, all: p&lt;0.04), only the Araclon ELISA results did not correlate with the MALDI MS, the Euroimmun ELISA and the N4PE Simoa results (supplementary file 5). We also observed moderate between-assay correlations of most of the Aβ40 values (range Spearman’s ρ: 0.3–0.6, all: p&lt;0.02), only between the MALDI MS assay and the N4PE Simoa assay there was no correlation (supplementary file 5).

A detailed summary of the median recovery with interquartile range (IQR) per pre-analytical sample handling variation, for each of the markers with each of the assays, is presented in supplementary file 6. For most assays, Aβ42 and Aβ40 values were somewhat lower in sodium-citrate samples (range of median recovery Aβ42: 85%–100%; Aβ40: 82%–99%) and somewhat higher in lithium-heparin samples (Aβ42: 104%–131%; Aβ40: 97%–128%; figures 1, 2) as compared to plasma EDTA samples. Aβ42 and Aβ40 values in serum samples were either lower, the same, or higher depending on the assay used (Aβ42: 36%–108%; Aβ40: 69%–115%; figures 1, 2). Sample type-mediated higher or lower Aβ values seemed largely independent of the technology and/or assay used. An exception might be lithium-heparin, as qualitatively, recoveries of both MS assays as well as both Simoa assays were similar for Aβ42, and of both MS assays and both ELISAs for Aβ40.

Independent of the assay used, if centrifugation was delayed for 24h, plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 values declined when tubes were held at RT (range Aβ42: 59%–81%; range Aβ40: 62%–93%), whereas this decline was not yet visible at earlier time points (1h and 3h) nor when tubes were held in the refrigerator up to 24h (figures 1, 2; except outliers in MALDI MS Aβ40 and N3PA Aβ40 data: see supplementary file 6). We observed this same assay-independent effect upon delayed storage of separated plasma (i.e. post-centrifugation and aliquoting; figures 1, 2). Plasma Aβ42 and Aβ40 values were decreased in samples that were held at RT for 24h prior to −80°C storage (Aβ42: 70%–85%; Aβ40: 68%–90%), whereas this decrease was not yet visible at time point 4h nor when the samples were held in the refrigerator for up to 24h (except outliers in MALDI MS Aβ40 data: see supplementary file 6). Two-week intermittent storage in the refrigerator prior to storage at −80°C also resulted in decreased Aβ42 (41%–79%) and Aβ40 values (27%–80%), independent of the assay used, while two-week intermittent storage at −20°C did not (figures 1, 2). Centrifugation temperature (RT or 4°C), aliquot volume (250μL, 500μL or 1000μL in 1.5mL-tubes) and sample freeze-thawing (up to 4 cycles) did not impact Aβ42 and Aβ40 values (figures 1, 2).

The Aβ42/40 ratio mitigated the pre-analytical variation observed on Aβ42 and Aβ40 values for only some of the assays and conditions (supplementary file 6 and 7). The observed pre-analytical effect at 24-hour delayed centrifugation (RT condition) could be mitigated by the Aβ42/40 ratio for only the Euroimmun ELISA assay, and not the other five assays. The observed effect of 24-hour delayed storage (RT condition) was mitigated by the Aβ42/40 ratio for four of six assays (C2N MS, Simoa N3PA, Euroimmun ELISA, Araclon ELISA), and the observed effect of two-week storage in the refrigerator was mitigated by this ratio for three of six assays (C2N MS, Simoa N3PA, Araclon ELISA).

Effect of pre-analytical variation on other blood-based biomarkers

We also measured levels of two other amyloid forms OAβ and APP699-711 and the non-amyloid biomarkers GFAP, NfL, tTau and pTau181 (absolute values in non-mistreated reference samples in supplementary file 4; median (IQR) recovery per pre-analytical condition per analyte in supplementary file 6).

Sample type influenced OAβ, GFAP, NfL, tTau and pTau181, but not APP699-711 (figure 3), in a similar way as for the Aβ42 and Aβ40 analytes. Compared to EDTA plasma samples, values were lower in sodium-citrate samples (range of median recovery: 74–103%), higher in lithium-heparin samples (except OAβ: recovery 52%; other: 103% – 206%) and either comparable (APP699-711, GFAP, NfL) or lower (OAβ, tTau, ptau181) in serum samples.

OAβ, APP699-711, GFAP, NfL and ptau181 were stable over 24h delayed centrifugation conditions both when tubes were held at RT or in the refrigerator pending centrifugation (figure 3; except one outlier for OAβ: see supplementary file 6). tTau however was not stable in whole blood, with lower values when tubes were held at RT for 3h (83%) and for 24h (49%), and higher values when tubes were held in the refrigerator for 3h (115%) and for 24h (129%) pending centrifugation. Also, centrifugation temperature affected tTau levels (4°C compared to RT condition: recovery 81%), while it did not affect the other markers. Aliquot tube filling did not affect any of the markers. Short term delayed storage (i.e., max 24h) did not affect any of the markers (except outliers in pTau181: see supplementary file 6), but APP699-711 and tTau levels were lower after two-week storage in the refrigerator (APP699-711: 72%; tTau: 85%). The marker levels remained stable upon two-week −20°C storage. Lastly, only GFAP levels were increased in the samples that underwent 4 additional freeze-thaw cycles (113%), while no change was observed at the second cycle. Levels of the other markers were not changed after up to 4 times repeated freeze-thawing.

DISCUSSION

We showed that between studies, largest pre-analytical variation is in time to centrifugation and time from centrifugation to storage, during which tubes are kept at RT or cold. Our experiments showed that time and temperature to centrifugation and storage are critical pre-analytical variables, as was blood collection tube type. Levels for all investigated markers were unaffected by differences in aliquot tube filling, short-term −20°C storage and up to three cycles of sample freeze-thawing. Based on our empirical observations, we recommend an SOP for the handling of EDTA plasma from collection to measurement (figure 4). Understanding pre-analytical sample handling effects on blood-based biomarkers and implementing SOPs to limit variation, is key to reach consistency across studies, technologies and laboratories. This will contribute to validating and interpreting blood-based biomarkers results across studies, and facilitates implementation of blood-based biomarkers into diagnostic and trial settings.

Aβ values were decreased in whole blood and in separated plasma at 24h when held at room temperature but not when stored in the refrigerator, and after two weeks in the refrigerator but not at −20°C. Therefore, we recommend in our SOP to store whole blood or separated plasma in the refrigerator when centrifugation and aliquot freezing is not possible within a short time window. Biomarkers OAβ, APP699-711, GFAP, NfL and pTau181 were stable under delayed centrifugation and storage conditions. It is noted that tTau was not resistant to delayed centrifugation, with lower tTau levels observed when whole blood was held at RT for ≥3h, and higher levels when whole blood was held in the refrigerator for ≥3h. tTau findings in our study were the exception among the biomarkers investigated, and are not in line with earlier publications employing other tTau assays, that showed that tTau was stable for up to 6h33 or 8h37 prior to centrifugation. Additionally, clinical studies on plasma tTau suggest that when measured in its current format, this is not an accurate biomarker for AD.13 Therefore, we decided not to adapt the SOP to the tTau findings. Instead, we recommend tTau biomarker studies to be conducted in biobanks with minimal centrifugation delays. Further, only tTau levels were influenced by centrifugation temperature, with lower levels in samples that were centrifuged at 4°C. We recommend adhering to RT centrifugation.

At this time, few studies are published on pre-analytical stability of blood-based Aβ42, Aβ40, tTau, GFAP, NfL and pTau181.33,34,36,37,40,46,47 None studied the variables included in our study comprehensively and only one analytical platform was used within each study. Results of previous studies corroborated our observed resistance of Aβ42 and Aβ40 to sample freeze-thawing (up to 3x)33,34,40,46 and to delayed centrifugation or storage when kept cold.36 Results on the effect of delayed centrifugation and storage at RT on Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels were conflicting.33,36,37 With different assays than used in our study, Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels in whole blood were found stable at RT over 8h,37 started declining from 1h onwards,33 or from 6h (Aβ42) and 48h (Aβ40) onwards.36 In separated plasma, levels were shown to decline at RT from 6h (Aβ42) and 8h (Aβ40) onwards.36 We did not include intermediate standing times between 3h/4h and 24h, but in our hands, Aβ42 and Aβ40 values started declining somewhere within this time window. Using the Aβ42/40 ratio instead of the single peptides was not a solution to mitigate all pre-analytical effects in the current study. The observed declines were somewhat more pronounced for Aβ42 as compared to Aβ40, suggesting that plasma Aβ42 is more unstable. Since we did not see an effect of tube filling on Aβ levels, adsorption of Aβ to plastics likely does not explain the observed decreases in Aβ levels, in contrast to earlier observations for the CSF where adsorption to plastics was an important pre-analytical variable.48 Ex vivo aggregation or proteolytic cleavage could be mechanisms at play.

Prior NfL studies showed, in agreement with our findings, that levels are stable in the refrigerator for up to 24h prior to processing and storage,38 and for 48h prior to processing at RT.47 It was also shown that NfL levels increase when samples are stored either at RT or in the refrigerator for 5 days,39 but we did not see such an increase after two weeks in the refrigerator. There is some conflicting literature on the effect of freeze-thawing on NfL levels, with some studies reporting no effect of sample freeze-thawing,34,38 while another study did report an effect.40 Furthermore, it was reported that plasma p-Tau181 levels were decreased at freeze-thaw cycle 4, while GFAP remained stable up to freeze-thaw cycle 4.34 Thus, if possible, using fresh aliquots might be preferred, although our findings show it is possible to freeze-thaw several times after initial freezing. So far, none studied the effects of delayed storage and processing on pTau and GFAP.

A strength of the current study is that we had a standardized, systematic study design to investigate variations in the pre-analytical phase on a broad panel of blood-based biomarkers. With all biomarkers measured in the same samples, we could make well-founded conclusions on the relevance of pre-analytical variables and establish a biomarker-independent SOP, even though there was some measurement variation for some assays. Further, we included six different assays with different technologies for Aβ, resulting in a technology-independent SOP. Interestingly, the observed pre-analytical effects on Aβ42 and Aβ40 values were largely technology-independent, although Spearman’s correlations between the assay results were only moderate. Possible causes for these moderate correlations is that different assays target different epitopes of the Aβ peptides and there are differences in assay sensitivity and selectivity,49 and inherent to the assay used, there are differences in how samples are handled from thawing until measurements.

Our study has some limitations as well. We empirically tested effects of pre-analytical variations on plasma EDTA samples only, since this is the matrix most commonly stored in dementia biobanks and used for AD blood-based biomarker testing. Different collection tubes resulted in different absolute biomarker values, which was also confirmed in an independent study,34 but we do not know yet if pre-analytical effects are similar for different blood sample types, which is subject of follow-up studies. Further, we did not investigate differences between K2EDTA and K3EDTA, which are both used commonly in dementia biobanks. Also, it might be that pre-analytical variations are dependent on the presence of a disease (e.g., healthy controls versus patients with AD) or on the biomarker starting concentration, which we did not investigate here. Also, we have to note that RT is not a standardized term. In this study, RT was by estimation in the range of 17-22°C, and we did not test higher ambient RTs. Further, we only investigated single pre-analytical parameters per experiment, while there might be interactions between parameters, which should be addressed in follow-up studies. Also it is noted that pre-analytics might have effect on both measurement precision and on analyte stability, which both affect the measured biomarker concentrations, and which affects clinical applicability of the biomarkers. Lastly, it is important to note that only one pTau181 assay was included in this study, which is a prototype Simoa assay applying the antibodies used in the Eli Lilly MSD set-up. This assay is not yet published elsewhere. How the findings obtained with this assay relate to other assays, such as the commercially available pTau181 Quanterix assay, remains to be established.

We recommend follow-up studies to confirm, and expand, our current findings, e.g., including the multiple plasma pTau assays that are currently coming available. For a comparative pTau pre-analytics study, we recommend the inclusion of AD patients, to include samples with higher starting concentrations. Especially for pTau217, many control samples were reported to be measured below the detection limit in previous research,50 which impacts measurement precision, therewith hinders interpretation of possible variation in levels due to pre-analytical conditions. Also, we recommend to extent on our findings. Time of day of collection and fasting status, as well as long-term stability at −80°C, were not investigated in the current study but were deemed relevant by expert opinion. It is noted that the SOP we designed might be tailored most to observational studies that store samples to measure multiple biomarkers now and in the future. If one has a specific marker defined in the protocol or a specific context of use in mind, different sample handling protocols may be preferred. Also, with novel blood-based biomarkers and assays entering the field and follow-up experiments to come, we realize the SOP presented here may need fine-tuning, which will only increase adoption of the SOP in a wide range of settings.

To conclude, we established a technology-independent and biomarker-independent SOP for plasma EDTA sample handling, from collection to storage to measurement. We recommend biobanks and clinical trials to adopt this SOP, to limit pre-analytical variability on blood biomarker results. Also, once the Alzheimer blood-based biomarkers reach clinical implementation, this SOP can be applied to reach optimal results in routine AD diagnostic blood biomarker measurements.

In 5. Storage, two-week 2-8°C condition, the recovery was 27% for the MALDI MS assay, which is below the y-axis limit. Horizontal, dashed reference lines were set at 90% and 110%, to visualize a &gt;10% change of the median under an experimental condition compared to the reference condition. MS=mass spectrometry, Na-citrate=sodium-citrate, Li-heparin=lithium-heparin, RT=room temperature, FT=freeze-thaw cycle

Figure 3. Effect of pre-analytical sample handling variations on biomarkers APP699-711, OAβ, GFAP, NfL, tTau and pTau181.

Values measured in the experimental conditions were normalized against the values measured in the reference conditions, which is EDTA plasma, centrifuged at 1800xg at room temperature, after a standing time of 30 minutes at room temperature, immediately followed by aliquoting and −80°C storage. Horizontal, dashed reference lines were set at 90% and 110%, to visualize a &gt;10% change of the median under an experimental condition compared to the reference condition. APP=amyloid precursor protein, OAβ=amyloid-β oligomerization tendency, GFAP=glial fibrillary acidic protein, NfL=neurofilament light, tTau=total tau, pTau181=tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, Na-citrate=sodium-citrate, Li-heparin=lithium-heparin, RT=room temperature, FT=freeze-thaw cycle.

Figure 4. Recommended plasma handling standardized operating procedure.

The SOP was constructed according to results obtained in systematic pre-analytical experiments. Deviating from this SOP might result in less reliable Aβ42 and Aβ40 measurements. For reliable total tau measurement, a maximum processing time of one hour might be necessary. Longer delays than 24h for centrifugation or two-weeks for storage might be possible, but this was not investigated in this study. RT=room temperature, wk=week.
