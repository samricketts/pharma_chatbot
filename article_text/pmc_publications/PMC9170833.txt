Pathological tau proteins in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mainly accumulate in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuritic plaques (NPs). However, the molecular properties of tau species present in NFTs and NPs are not known. We tested the hypothesis that tau species within NFT-predominant tissue (NFT_AD) are distinct and more toxic than those in NP-predominant tissue (NP_AD). We analyzed the tau species from post mortem prefrontal cortical brains of NFT_AD and NP_AD. Compared to NP_AD, NFT_AD displayed highly phosphorylated tau oligomers, possessed tau oligomers in extracellular vesicles, and the 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) isoforms were differentially expressed between the groups. Comparison of tau proteins isolated from NFT- versus NP-AD subjects demonstrated higher tau seeding activity in NFT subjects and a greater degree of inducing synaptic loss in cultured neurons. We propose that tau species from NFT-predominant tissues possess greater levels of degenerative properties, thereby causing synaptic loss and cognitive decline.

pmc1 | PART I: NARRATIVE

The global epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, has been deteriorating. Around 50 million people worldwide are afflicted with AD each year, and more than 150 million people are projected to have the disease by the year 2050.1 One of the AD pathological hallmarks, along with an accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, is the formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), composed of highly phosphorylated aggregates of misfolded tau protein.2,3 Phosphorylated tau proteins are dissociated from microtubules and migrate from axons to somatodendritic compartments, where they are assembled into protofibrils, also called paired helical filaments (PHFs), and subsequently, into NFTs.4 Tau proteins also accumulate in the form of neuritic plaques (NPs). NPs consist of the aggregates of altered glial cells and swollen cellular processes of nerve cells, containing, in part, argyrophilic and fibrillary masses of the abnormal tau protein. Deposits of Aβ fill the extracellular space within the reaches of NPs.5 NPs are more patchily distributed than Aβ deposits and are present at much lower densities. The severity of dementia positively correlates with neocortical NFTs, but not with senile plaques.6 It has been collectively demonstrated in recent studies that tau pathology is associated with neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments.7–9 Abnormal tau protein accumulates in the medial temporal lobe, and when it spreads to neocortical regions, the cognitive functions are compromised in AD patients. Based on the severity of NFTs and the regions in which they accumulate, the brains of AD patients are categorized as NFT or Braak stages ranging from I to VI.10 Interestingly, while the density of NFTs and NPs in the temporal lobe aligns well through different Braak stages, their distribution in the frontal lobe often does not represent Braak staging.10 Further, tau pathology in the frontal cortical regions is directly correlated with disease progression and dementia rate.6,11 Understanding heterogeneity in tau pathology has been a major challenge in clinical research.12–14 Given the finding that dementia severity correlates with NFT but not NP burden in the frontal lobe, we tested the hypothesis that tau species within NFT_AD brain tissue are more toxic than those in NP_AD tissue.

In our study, NFT_AD patients had higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores compared to NP_AD patients. This observation is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated a direct correlation between NFT and dementia.6 We observed that post mortem brain tissue of NFT_AD patients compared to that of NP_AD patients displayed more soluble tau oligomers, which were significantly correlated with CDR score. The tau oligomers derived from NFT_AD exhibited more seeding activity than tau derived from NP_AD patients. These findings suggest that tau proteins derived from NFT_AD patients are more pathogenic than NP_AD-associated tau proteins. It is tempting to speculate that NP_AD-derived tau may facilitate the formation of NFTs. The mechanism underlying NP formation and whether NP_AD-derived tau can facilitate NFT formation need to be examined. One possibility is that Aβ plaques may be associated with the formation of tau NPs. For example, both AD and Down syndrome patients display Aβ plaques, thereby possibly possessing NPs.15,16 In contrast, primary tauopathy patients do not have Aβ plaques, so they do not display NPs. Further, animal studies likely support this notion. For instance, the injection of AD-brain–derived tau proteins in Aβ-plaque–bearing 5xFAD animal models induced the formation of NPs.16 However, injection of AD tau proteins in primary tauopathy animal models, which do not bear Aβ plaques, induced only the formation of NFTs, but not NPs.17 We also found that the extracellular vesicles (EVs) of NFT_AD patients contained tau oligomers, whereas NP_AD patients lacked tau oligomers in their EVs. EV tau is believed to mediate tau propagation from one neuron to another through synaptically connected neurons.18 It is therefore reasonable to conceive of a scenario in which EV oligomeric tau in NFT_AD propagates faster than the EV tau of NP_AD, leading to the highest CDR scores being found in NFT_AD patients.

We observed a distinct pattern of phosphorylated tau proteins in NFT_AD and NP_AD patients. Our data indicate that tau proteins derived from NP_AD patients are moderately phosphorylated compared to those derived from NFT_AD patients. The higher hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins in NFT_AD patients compared to NP_AD patients is another neurodegenerative property that potentially explains why NP_AD patients have lower CDR scores compared to NFT_AD patients. Recent studies also suggest that the phosphorylation level of tau proteins is associated with neurodegeneration and dementia progressions.13,19 Aberrant phosphorylation of tau proteins leads to their accumulation, affecting several neuronal functions, including axonal transport and synaptic transmission.12,20–23 Under physiological conditions, tau, as a microtubule-binding protein, regulates the bidirectional transport of intracellular cargoes by differentially tuning the processivity of kinesin-1 and dynein motor proteins.24,25 Such transport is required to maintain normal cellular homeostasis.26,27 The hyperphosphorylation of tau protein causes its detachment from microtubules and subsequently leads to reduced axonal transport.28–31 Although the exact mechanism by which pathogenic tau protein causes axonal transport impairments is still unclear, some reports have suggested that tau protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3β), may play a role in reduced axonal transport. For example, increased tau phosphorylation leads to GSK3β activation, promoting kinesin-1 detachment from its transported organelle cargoes and reducing axonal transport.32–34 Neurons communicate with each other through synaptic transmission.35,36 Pathological tau proteins dissociated from microtubules are mis-sorted to pre- and postsynaptic terminals, leading to impaired synaptic transmission.37 It has also been shown that pathological tau affects presynaptic transmission by directly interfering with synaptic vesicles or neurotransmission-associated kinases, such as GSK3β and Cdk5.37,38 Phosphorylation of postsynaptic tau proteins leads to long-term depression, likely through the downregulation of surface glutamate receptors.39,40 On the other hand, phosphorylation of presynaptic tau proteins leads to a reduced firing rate, which is possibly caused by mislocation of the axon’s initial segments.41 Therefore, developing strategies to mitigate tau phosphorylation as early as possible may be a critical path to prevent further deteriorations. However, the role of specific phosphorylated residues on tau protein still needs to be addressed. Using appropriate experimental approaches such as site-directed mutagenesis and performing a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments will help to delineate the role of distinct phosphorylated tau species on axonal transport and synaptic transmission.

Human tau protein isoforms are expressed with 3-repeat (3R) and 4-repeat (4R) domains with equal 3R/4R ratios under normal physiological conditions.42 Imbalance in 3R/4R rations is associated with neuronal dysfunctions.43 We observed NFT_AD patients displaying increased 3R tau oligomers compared to NP_AD patients. Moreover, we did not observe significant changes in the 4R oligomers between NP_AD and NFT_AD. It is conceivable that AD pathology severity is parallel to 3R oligomers. However, the underlying mechanisms of the 3R and 4R alterations remain unknown. One possibility is that 3R tau could have inhibited the formation of 4R oligomers, as suggested by a previous in vitro study.44 Another possibility is that 4R tau exhibits a faster turnover rate compared to 3R tau.45 In vivo experiments need to be carried out to determine whether 3R tau inhibits the formation of 4R tau aggregates or whether 4R tau exhibits faster turnover rates. The change in 4R/3R can also be due to dysregulation of tau exon10 alternative splicing. Further, 3R and 4R isoforms are differentially localized in axons or dendrites.46 The physiological and pathophysiological features of their distinct localizations still need to be explored.

In our study, we observed that NFT_AD patients displayed severe synaptic loss compared to NP_AD. Further, soluble tau species isolated from NFT_AD induced more synaptic loss in vitro. This finding suggests that soluble tau proteins from NFT_AD possess more pathogenic characteristics than tau proteins derived from NP_AD patients. Synaptic plasticity plays a key role in transient and long-range communication between brain regions.47 The synapses that facilitate synaptic plasticity are vital for memory storage.48 The synaptic loss that causes abnormal neural oscillations and network dysconnectivity may be a common mechanism contributing to AD-associated cognitive and behavioral alterations. It is shown that tau pathology leads to synaptic loss and deficits in memory forming grid cell firing.49–51 It is likely that pathogenic tau proteins may cause defects in cargo transport and preand postsynaptic functions, leading to synaptic loss. The N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors are important in maintaining functional synapses.52 Normal tau proteins form a complex with Fyn to stabilize the surface NMDA receptors through postsynaptic density protein 95. The GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of postsynaptic tau proteins causes dissociation from other synaptic proteins, leading to fewer surface NMDA receptors and long-term depression.53 Normal tau proteins also induce the formation of new synapses by regulating the cascades of microtubule stability, c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling, and kinesin-mediated axonal transport.54 Due to the limited availability of normal tau proteins, as they steadily convert into pathogenic proteins, normal tau-mediated physiological functions, such as axonal transport, may be impaired, eventually leading to synaptic loss. However, the precise mechanisms of pathogenic tau-protein–mediated synapse degeneration in AD remain to be experimentally demonstrated. Future work should elucidate how pathogenic tau proteins affect cargo transport, neurotransmitter release, trafficking of postsynaptic receptors, and signaling cascades.

In conclusion, we found that NFT_AD patients had a unique pattern of soluble tau oligomers and phosphoepitopes compared to NP_AD patients. The tau species derived from NFT_AD patients had severe tau seeding activity compared to tau derived from NP_AD patients. Further, NFT_ AD patients showed severe synaptic loss, and their soluble tau proteins induced synaptic loss in vitro. Notably, NFT_AD patients have higher CDRs, and their tau oligomers are significantly correlated with CDRs. We therefore propose that the degenerative nature of tau species observed in NFT_AD patients leads to synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Tau accumulation as part of AD pathology has been known for the last three decades.3,55–57 However, our molecular understanding of tau protein accumulation and its cascades leading to synaptic loss is largely insufficient. Our study suggests that soluble tau oligomeric proteins may be a leading causative agent in synaptic loss. Therefore, untangling the molecular mechanism in the formation of tau oligomers and their cascades in synapse degeneration will likely allow us to develop effective therapeutic interventions for this debilitating disease. Although prion-like propagation of tau proteins throughout the brain is believed to be a significant cause of synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD patients,58 it is possible that neuronal dysfunction precedes tau pathology in a given brain region.38 For instance, our data revealed that NP_AD patients displayed non-significant changes in soluble tau oligomers compared to normal individuals. However, we observed significant reductions in the number of synapses in NP_AD patients compared to normal individuals. This finding suggests that pathological tau does not necessarily need to be present in a particular brain region (e.g., prefrontal cortical [PFC] regions) to alter synaptic numbers and cause cognitive decline. Instead, the presence of pathological tau in one brain region can potentially affect network activity and synaptic numbers in synaptically connected, tau-lacking distal brain regions. For example, after tau injections in the locus coeruleus, an impaired neuronal activity in the hippocampus and cortex was observed even before pathological tau resulted in the spread and accumulation to the distal regions.59 This notion is also supported by a mouse study demonstrating that synaptic loss precedes tangle formation.38,60 Therefore, accessing tau pathology and simultaneously monitoring neuronal activity in tau-lacking associated-distal brain regions will be important in predicting the disease progression in living early-AD patients. TauPET (tau positron emission tomography) imaging combined with fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) could help monitoring tau pathology progression and altered neuronal activity in synaptically connected distal brain regions. TauPET is widely used to monitor the regional distribution and progression of tau pathology.61 Although second-generation tau tracers (e.g., MK-6240, RO-948, PI-2620, GTP1, PM-PBB3, and JNJ64349311) have more specific bindings to pathological tau compared to first-generation tau tracers,4,62 they are still not capable of differentiating tau-containing NPs from NFTs.4 It may be crucial to distinguish between NPs and NFTs in living AD patients to personalize the treatment options. Therefore, improving TauPET imaging methods, such as those that can help to distinguish NFT_AD from NP_AD, will deepen our understanding of disease progression in humans, helping to design therapeutic strategies accordingly. The tau tracer specificity against NPs versus NFTs could potentially be optimized by combining autoradiography (tau tracers) with AT8 immunostaining on frozen human brain samples. Finally, while Braak staging can be applied to categorize AD brains at the population level, it does not always reflect the broad clinical variables observed in AD patients. We suggest that new approaches need to be adopted, with the inclusion of CDR score, apolipoprotein E (APOE) variants, and disease duration, to account for interindividual variations in the degree of tau pathology and dementia.

2 | PART II: CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND STUDY DESIGN

2.1 | Soluble tau oligomers and cognitive decline linked to NFT_AD patients

We first performed immunohistochemical staining (IHC) with the antiphosphorylated tau antibody AT8 (phosphoSer202/Thr205) on the PFC obtained from control and AD patients (Brodmann area 10). In NFT/Braak stage VI, as reported previously, we observed interindividual variations of neurofibrillary changes in the form of NPs or NFTs (Figure 1A).10 Based on the number of NPs or NFTs among the cases, we grouped them into NP_predominant AD (NP_AD) and NFT_predominant AD (NFT_AD) (Figure 1B and Figure S1A, B in supporting information). In agreement with a previous report,6 NP_AD and NFT_AD patients had higher CDR scores than normal individuals (Figure 1C). Further, NFT_AD patients showed higher CDR scores compared to NP_AD patients (Figure 1C). We next investigated whether these tau pathologies (NFT and NP) were composed of different tau species.13,63,64 Because soluble tau proteins, but not insoluble tau, have been proposed to be associated with tau spread and toxicity,65,66 we examined the molecular features of soluble tau proteins from NP_AD and NFT_AD patients. To investigate whether tau oligomers are differentially expressed in NFT_AD versus NP_AD, we performed western blotting on the total soluble proteins isolated from post mortem brain tissues (Figure 1D and Figure S1C). There were no significant differences in monomeric tau protein among the controls (cases 1–5), NFT_AD (cases 12, 13, 15, 18) and NP_AD (cases 6–11, 14, 16, 17; Figure 1E). Interestingly, NFT_AD displayed significantly higher levels of tau oligomers, while NP_AD displayed fewer tau oligomers (Figure 1F). The molecular weight range of tau oligomers is similar to previously published reports.67,68 Next, we measured and correlated the optical intensity of tau oligomers and monomers with a compound measure of cognition: CDR score. A strong positive correlation was observed between oligomeric tau and CDR (Figure 1G), but not between monomeric tau and CDR (Figure 1H). These data imply that tau oligomers are highly expressed in NFT_AD, accompanied by significant cognitive decline. A western blot for cases 19 through 34 is shown in Figure S1D.

We next examined the seeding activity of tau species isolated from NP_AD and NFT_AD patients. We used Tau FRET biosensor cells to monitor tau protein aggregation.69 We isolated tau proteins from the soluble fraction through immunoprecipitation (Figure S2A in supporting information). An equal amount of isolated tau proteins (600 ng/mL) from control, NFT_AD, and NP_AD was incubated with biosensor cells. After 3 days of incubation, tau isolates from NFT_AD induced significantly higher numbers of tau inclusion-bearing cells compared to tau from NP_AD. No tau inclusions were observed with the tau isolated from the control group (Figure 1I, J). Secretion of tau protein in the form of EVs has been reported in a mouse model.70 It is believed that pathological tau containing EVs mediates the tau propagation.18 However, the pathogenic properties of EV tau in human subjects have not yet been investigated. We isolated EVs from control and AD cases (Figure S2B). Isolated EVs were readily taken up by cultured neurons (Figure S2C). Interestingly, EVs from NFT_AD patients contained oligomeric tau, while they were absent in the control and NP_AD patients (Figure 1K). Also, EV tau from NFT_AD robustly induced tau aggregation in Tau FRET biosensor cells compared to EV tau derived from NP_AD (Figure 1L, M). These findings suggest that soluble tau proteins of NFT_AD possess high seeding activity compared to tau proteins derived from NP_AD patients. As such, EV tau oligomers likely reflect the severity of the disease.

2.2 | Diverse tau species in NFT_AD patients

Phosphorylation of tau proteins is linked to disease progression and cognitive decline.13,19 We therefore examined whether NFT_AD and NP_AD possess distinct tau phosphorylation sites. A comprehensive list of western blots is presented in Figure S3 in supporting information. AT8 (phosphoSer202/Thr205) and AT180 (phosphoThr231) were significantly increased in NFT_AD compared to control and to NP_AD, with no changes between NP_AD and NFT_AD (Figure 2A, B). PhosphoThr217 was significantly increased in NFT_AD compared to control and NP_AD (Figure 2C). However, there were no significant changes between the control and NP_AD (Figure 2C). In contrast, phospho-Thr181 was significantly reduced in NFT_AD compared to the control group, while no change was observed in NP_AD (Figure 2D). No significant changes were observed in phosphoSer262 or phosphoSer404 among the groups (Figure 2E, F). These findings suggest that AT8, AT180, and phosphoThr217 are associated with NFT_AD. Future studies should address the status of tau phosphorylation (NP vs. NFT) during the earlier Braak stage of diseases.

We next investigated potential alterations in the composition of the 3R and 4R isoforms in NFT_AD versus NP_AD. Unlike total tau monomers (Figure 1D, E), we observed that 3R monomers were significantly increased in NP_AD and NFT_ AD compared to the control group with no changes between NP_AD and NFT_AD (Figure 2G, H). 3R oligomers were significantly higher in NFT_AD and NP_AD compared to the control (Figure 2G, I). Furthermore, the NFT_AD group displayed significantly higher levels of 3R oligomers compared to NP_AD (Figure 2G, I). We did not, however, observe any significant changes in 4R monomers (Figure 2J, K), whereas 4R oligomers showed a significant increase from the control to NFT_AD with no changes between NP_AD and NFT_AD (Figure 2J, L). These results suggest that the 3R oligomers are associated with NFT_AD rather than with NP_AD. Further, 3R monomers and 3R oligomers correlated positively whereas 4R monomers and 4R oligomers correlated negatively (Figure 2M, N). It is possible that 3R monomers and 3R oligomers have similar decay times, while 4R monomers and 4R oligomers may have different decay times.

2.3 | Soluble tau-associated synaptic loss in NFT_AD patients

Given that NFT_AD possesses more tau oligomers with unique phosphorylation sites, inducing a robust tau accumulation in Tau FRET biosensor cells, it is possible that these tau species are associated with synaptic loss. We performed IHC staining with the presynaptic marker Bassoon and the postsynaptic marker Homer1 (Figure 3A). NFT_AD patients had a much lower number of presynaptic Bassoon-immunoreactive puncta compared to the control group, and a significantly lower number of Bassoon-immunoreactive puncta compared to the NP_AD patients (Figure 3B). Likewise, Homer1-immunoreactive puncta were significantly decreased in NFT_AD compared to NP_AD (Figure 3C). IHC analysis with an additional synaptic marker synaptophysin revealed similar results (Figure S4 in supporting information). We next asked whether soluble tau proteins isolated from NP_AD and NFT_AD differentially affected synaptic numbers in vitro. We purified soluble tau proteins from different groups (NFT_AD and NP_AD) and incubated (1 μg/mL) in wild-type mouse neuronal cultures (Figure 3D). Interestingly, NFT_AD–derived tau caused significantly greater Bassoon- and Homer1-immunoreactive puncta loss compared to NP_AD–derived tau (Figure 3E–G). These in vitro results are directly correlated with in vivo observations, suggesting that it is more likely that soluble tau oligomers may be the main driver of synaptic loss in AD, NFT_AD in particular.

2.4 | SerpinA3N induces tau oligomerization in vivo

We next investigated the potential underlying mechanism that induces oligomerization of tau protein. Altered proteostasis leads to cellular stress, aging, increased protein half-life, protein misfolding, and more deleterious effects.71,72 Based on the recently published RNA sequencing studies,73–75 we selected AD-associated proteostasis targets and injected them into the CA1 region of tauopathy mouse model P301S60(Figure 4A). We found that alpha1-antichymotrpsin (ACT), known as SerpinA3N, strongly induced the formation of tau oligomers without altering monomeric tau levels (Figure 4B–D). In contrast, ACT upregulated both 3R oligomers and monomers (Figure 4E–G), which is consistent with changes of 3R monomers and 3R oligomers in the human NFT_AD brain (Figure 2G–I). Like the total tau proteins, we observed ACT-induced formation of 4R oligomers without altering 4R monomers (Figure 4H–J). Quantification of individual monomeric 3R and 4R bands are shown in Figure S5 in supporting information (@ top, $middle, and #bottom). These results indicate that ACT induces the oligomerization of tau proteins. Polymorphisms in the ACT gene (the BstNI cleavage site in the signal peptide) are shown to be associated with AD risk.76 Therefore, we performed Sanger sequencing to test whether ACT polymorphism was associated with NP_AD or NFT_AD patients. We were unable to find these polymorphisms in our samples (Figure 4K), suggesting that ACT polymorphisms are not associated with the development of predominant NPs versus predominant NFTs. However, we observed that the ACT protein was significantly higher in NFT_AD than in normal (Figure 4L and M). This result indicates that overexpression of ACT may be associated with increased tau pathology.

3 | PART III: DETAILED METHODS AND RESULTS

3.1 | Human post mortem brains

De-identified human autopsy brain tissue from frontotemporal cortical tissues (Brodmann area 10) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health NeuroBioBank and stored at −80°C until further use. The sample details are given in Table 1. Pathologically confirmed AD cases were selected. In addition, age-matched cognitively normal individuals (without tau pathology in prefrontal cortex on neuropathological examination) were used as control in the experiments. Cases were not presorted based on the levels of tau or Aβ pathologies, race, sex, and education.

3.2 | Isolation of soluble tau proteins from human post mortem tissue

The soluble proteins from the post mortem tissues were isolated as described previously with minor modifications.13 For homogenization, the frozen brain samples were placed in ice-cold 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (pH 7.4, 7001–044, Gibco) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1860932, Thermo Scientific). All the procedures were carried out at 4°C. The samples were then homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder at a ratio of 4x PBS volume: 1x tissue weight. Freshly prepared cortical homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes, and the supernatant was collected. The collected supernatant was spun down again at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes. The supernatants were transferred to appropriate vessels for the ultra-centrifuge and centrifuged at 100,800 × g for 1 hour. The resultant supernatant containing the soluble fraction and the pellet containing the vesicular and insoluble proteins were collected. The soluble fraction was used for western blotting analysis of the soluble oligomeric tau proteins. The concentration of the soluble tau proteins was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with Tau-5 antibody according to manufacturer’s instructions (Human Tau Solid-phase sandwich ELISA, #KHB0041, Thermo Scientific).

3.3 | Enrichment of extracellular vesicles

Isolation of EVs from frozen post mortem cortical samples was performed as described previously with some modifications.77,78 All procedures were carried out at 4°C. The brain samples were homogenized in an ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, and protease inhibitor (1860932, Thermo Scientific). The homogenate was immediately centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 minutes and then at 10,000 g for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant was collected and transferred onto a centrifugal tube containing the sucrose gradient (2.0 M to 1.5 M, 1.0 M, 0.825 M, 0.65 M, and 0.475 M) and ultracentrifuged at 179,200 × g for 17 hours. After centrifugation, the EV enriched fractions (V &amp; VI) were collected and concentrated using Amicon centrifugal filters (3000 NMWL). Isolated tau proteins were measured using ELISA assay with Tau-5 antibody according to manufacturer’s instructions (Human Tau Solid-phase sandwich ELISA, #KHB0041, Thermo Scientific).

3.4 | Purification of tau proteins by immunoprecipitation

Tau proteins from the aforementioned soluble fractions were immunopurified using Pierce Direct IP kit (cat. # PI26148). We isolated tau proteins from all the cases (case no: 1–18). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the AminoLink plus Coupling Resin was washed with a coupling buffer, and incubated with 10 μg of Tau5 antibody. The coupling between the antibody and resin was performed for 2 hours with gentle rotation (4 rpm) at 4 °C. To remove the unbound antibodies, the resins were washed three times with a washing buffer on gentle rotation for 2 minutes per wash; 1–3 mg of isolated proteins (from the aforementioned soluble fractions) was added to resin and immunoprecipitation was allowed to occur overnight with gentle rotation (4 rpm) at 4 °C. The resin was washed with a wash buffer three times to remove the unbound proteins. The resin-bound tau proteins were eluted with a 75 μL elution buffer. Tau eluates were stored at −80°C until further use.

3.5 | Tau seeding assay

The Tau Biosensor (ATCC CRL-3275) cells stably expressing the repeat domain of Tau conjugated yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were cultured in 24-well coverslips at 37°C, 5% CO2 in a complete medium (for 500 mL: 450 mL DMEM, 50 mL FBS, 5 mL Penstrep [100x], 5 mL glutamate [100x], and 5 mL sodium pyruvate [100x]). Lipofectamine 2000 (3% final volume) was mixed with 0.4–0.6 μg/mL of isolated (IP) tau proteins and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the CRL cells, incubated for 2 days, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hour, and YFP signals were imaged at a SP5 Leica microscope. We added tau proteins isolated from every case (n = 18) with triplicates. The number of tau inclusion containing cells were counted blindly and normalized with total number of cells (DAPI).

3.6 | Stereotaxic injection of ACT in mouse brain

Animal care and handling were performed according to the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York). Three-month-old P301S animals were used for our experiments. All mice were maintained on a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle (light cycle beginning at 6:00) at a temperature of 23 °C. Food and water were supplied ad libitum. The mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (90 mg/kg/9 mg/kg) and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. All injections were delivered at a rate of 0.3–0.8 μL/min via a 10-μL Hamilton syringe (Hamilton Co.) and an injection needle (33-gauge NanoFil Needle Assortment, blunt; Worcester Polytechnic Institute) using a syringe pump (KD Scientific). In total, 3ug of ACT (AF4709, R&amp;D System) was injected in the right CA1 region in each mouse (AP-2.0, ML-1.3, and DV-1.5). The needle was kept in position for 5 minutes before slow withdrawal to prevent leakage of the liquid infused. After a 1-week incubation period, mice were sacrificed and the brain samples were collected for western blotting.

3.7 | Electrophoresis and western blot

Protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis. Isolated protein samples were lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-lysis buffer (Laemmli Sample Buffer, Biorad, cat. #1610747) by boiling at 95°C for 5 minutes with 50 mM dithiothreitol. The protein lysates (20 μg) were separated in equal volume on 4 to 20% TGX StainFree Gels (Bio-Rad, cat #5671095) based on their molecular weights and transferred to immune-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF cat. 1620177). The membranes were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Bio-Rad, Cat. A3912) for 1 hour and followed by incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% tween20) 6 × 10 minutes, incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour, again washed with PBST 6 × 10 minutes and then developed using ECL solution (Thermo Scientific, cat. #P132106). The following primary antibodies were used: TAU-5 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #AHB0042, 1:5000), AT-8 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #MN1020, 1:3000), Actin (Cell Signaling, cat#. 4970, 1:3000), HT-7 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #MN1000, 1:3000), Thr231(Thermo Scientific, cat. #355200, 1:3000), Ser404 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #44758, 1:3000), Thr217 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #44744, 1:3000), AT180 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #MN1040, 1:3000), Ser262 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #44750, 1:3000), Thr181 (Thermo Scientific, cat. #MN1050, 1:3000), 3R (Sigma, cat. #05-803, 1:3000), and 4R (Sigma, cat. #05-804, 1:3000).

3.8 | Neuronal culture

Cortical neurons were cultured from wild-type P1 pups. The procedures were performed as described previously with modifications.79 Briefly, after dissection in Hybernate A solution, cortical tissue was digested with papain for 30 minutes. Papain solution was inactivated with an ovomucoid inhibitor, tissues were dissociated, and passed through a 20-μm mesh filter. To remove the cell debris and immune cells, we performed negative immunopanning in Lectin 1–coated dishes with goat-anti mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)G+IgM and goat-anti rat IgG antibodies. A positive immunopanning with neural cell adhesion molecule L1 antibody was performed to enrich the neurons. Neurons were cultured in Neurobasal Plus Medium with ingredients (for 20 mL: 19 mL Neurobasal, 200 μL Penstep [100x], 200 μL glutamine [100x], 200 μL sodium pyruvate [100x], 400 μL B27 [50x], and 20 μL BDNF). Half of the medium was replaced every 3 days. To study the effect of tau strains on synaptogenesis, purified tau proteins (1 μg/μL) were added in 14-day-old neuronal culture. After 3 days, the cultured neurons were washed with PBS twice each for 5 minutes and fixed with 4%PFA for 1 hour before processing for IHC. To detect EV uptake, isolated EVs were labelled with PKH67 Green Fluorescent cell Linker Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. PKH67GL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Green dye–labelled EVs were added in neuronal culture, incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature, unbound dye was washed with PBS (2 × 10 minutes), and imaged with Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope.

3.9 | Immunohistochemistry

The paraffin-brain embedded sections (10 μm thickness) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (100%, 100%, 95%, and 70%) and, then heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed (Antigen Retrieval Buffer, abcam # ab93678). The cultured neurons containing coverslips were fixed for an hour with 4%PFA. After a brief wash with PBS, deparaffinized human tissues/cultured neurons were incubated with 10% donkey serum in PBST for 30 minutes. Primary antibody (against AT8 [Thermo Scientific, cat. #MN1020, 1:500], Homer1 [Synaptic Systems, cat. #160002, 1:500] or Bassoon [Enzo Life Sciences, cat. #ADI-VAM-PS003-F, 1:500]) was added and incubated for 48 hours at 4°C, washed 3 × 10 minutes with PBST, probed with corresponding secondary antibodies for 2 hours, then washed again with PBST before counterstaining with DAPI. The tissues were mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount and imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope.

3.10 | Sanger sequencing

Genomic DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent Sanger sequencing were done by GENEWIZ LLC. Forward primer 5′-CAG AGT TGA GAA TGG AGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTC TCC TGG GTC AGA TTC-3′ were used as described before.76 We performed multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega and Jalview tools (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/).

3.11 | Data and statistical analysis

All statistical details of the experiments can be found in either the figure legends or the supporting information figure legends, including the value of n, the P value, and statistical test being used. For all purposes, P ≤ .05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software. Unpaired t test was used to compare two groups. For more than two groups, oneway analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction was used. (1) For western blot quantification, using Fiji software,80 each immunoreactive band was selected with a rectangle tool and the intensity was measured with a wand tool. It was then normalized to the corresponding beta-actin immunoreactive bands. (2) An example for NP and NFT is shown in Figure 1A. At least three slices/cases were used. The number of NPs and NFTs were blindly counted under the microscope. The total tissue area was accessed to count the number of NPs and NFTs. It allowed us to reliably group the AD cases as NFT_predominant versus NP_predominant cases. The cases with a greater number of NFTs than number of NPs considered NFT_predominant and vice versa. (3) We imaged the cultured neurons/slices with 60x objective, 10 μm depth, and 0.5 μm intervals between the scans. The number of synaptic puncta was quantified using the SynQuant plugin installed to Fiji software as described previously.81 The following parameters were used to detect the puncta: 10 as a Z-score particle detection, 10 as a minimum particle size, 200 as a maximum particle size, 0.25 as a minimum fill, and 2 as a maximum width-height (WH) ratio. (4) We blindly counted the number of tau inclusion containing TauBiosensor cells.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Systematic review: We systematically searched PubMed to identify the relevant literature on tau pathology, sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and synaptic loss. There are several articles that found a strong correlation between tau pathology and dementia or atrophy. Few studies aimed to address the underlying mechanism in the formation of tau pathology. The relevant literature is appropriately cited. However, there are no articles available analyzing the molecular and pathophysiological features of tau species in neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-predominant versus neuritic plaque (NP)-predominant AD patients.

Interpretation: Our work shows that NFT_AD patients display a unique pattern of soluble tau oligomers and tau phosphoepitopes compared to NP_AD patients. The tau oligomers derived from NFT_AD patients possessed a severe pathogenic property compared to tau derived from NP_AD patients. It suggests that toxic tau species may be a major driver in synaptic loss and cognitive decline in NFT_AD patients.

Future directions: Future studies should aim to address the distinct role of NFTs and NPs in synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction at molecular levels. The key experiments to augment our hypothesis are (1) combining tau positron emission tomography studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict the disease progression, (2) developing animal or organoid models to investigate the role of NFTs and NPs in synaptic loss, and (3) investigating the role of distinct phosphorylated tau species in tau propagation and synaptic loss.
