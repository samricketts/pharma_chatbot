Glycosylation, one of the most important post-translational protein modifications, is known to be altered in a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases that results in cognitive and memory impairments. To investigate the progression of such disease, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a unique biofluid that may possess important biochemical and neurochemical changes due to the disease, is utilized. However, due to the low concentration of proteins in CSF, a large volume of the biofluid is often required to comprehensively characterize the glycome in CSF. In this work, a glycomic study of CSF was performed using as little as 10 µL of CSF. This approach was executed with permethylation of released N-glycans with minimal sample clean-up, in conjunction with an online purification system attached to liquid chromatography and a high-resolution mass spectrometer. This technique was then applied to clinical samples. Preliminary data suggests that fucosylated and bisecting GlcNAc structures were higher in abundances in females with AD, while both females and males exhibited lower abundances of high mannose structures.

Introduction

Glycosylation, one of the most prevalent protein posttranslational modifications, plays a variety of important roles in biological systems 1. Glycans are known to function in a number of cellular processes that include cell-cell communication 2, cell trafficking 3, protein solubility 4, and many others. Protein glycosylation can be categorized into two types: N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation. In general, N-glycans are attached at specific amino acid sequence motifs consisting of Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid except for proline. Meanwhile, O-glycans are linked to Ser/Thr without any specific amino acid sequence motif. Moreover, N-glycans have a common core structure that consists of GlcNAc2Man3, while O-glycans exhibit multiple core structures 5–7. These protein modifications are much larger and significantly more complex due to the microheterogeneity of glycan structures. The complex nature of glycosylation is due not only to alterations in the monosaccharide composition of glycan structures, but also due to the presence of various linkages, stereochemistry, and branching 6. These changes are known to alter protein function and have therefore been associated with various diseases including cancers 8–11 and neurological disorders 12, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) 13–14.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a sample matrix that is exceptionally intriguing for the study of neurological disorders. As a filtrate of plasma and due to its direct contact with the brain and spinal cord, biochemical changes that occur during disease progression can be revealed in CSF. This is particularly true for neurodegenerative diseases, as they are more likely to be related to alterations in the central nervous system 15–18. Although CSF is a valuable source of information for biochemical changes in the central nervous system 19, its complex matrix 18, 20 and low protein concentration present challenges, particularly in glycomic studies. Adding to the challenges presented by low CSF protein levels 18 is the observation that many proteins in CSF are often not glycosylated 20–21. Due to these issues, comprehensive glycome characterization studies of CSF have historically required several hundred microliters of material 22–23.

One way to overcome these challenges is to use highly sensitive mass spectrometers. Mass spectrometry is one of the most frequently utilized techniques for carbohydrate analysis due to the availability of instruments with high sensitivity, resolution, and mass accuracy 5. However, mass spectrometry itself is not an adequate tool to characterize glycans; separation is often required to avoid competitive ionization and to simplify spectral interpretation. Therefore, the combination of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has become widely popular for the characterization and quantitation of glycans 5–6.

Along with LC-MS, the sensitivity of glycan analysis can be improved by permethylation, a routine carbohydrate derivatization technique that modifies glycans to become more hydrophobic, thereby increasing ionization efficiency and rendering them amenable to positive ionization mode detection 24. Additionally, because permethylated glycans are highly hydrophobic, they are well-retained on robust reverse phase columns such as C18, and provide excellent separation 5–6.

Alzheimer’s Disease is a common neurodegenerative disease, described as an advanced form of age-dependent dementia that is linked to cognitive disfunction 13, 25–27. Globally, approximately 10 million people are diagnosed with dementia per year, most aged 80 and older 28. Due to changes in the brain triggered by AD before the presentation of initial symptoms, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), there is a need for early-stage diagnosis biomarker research 17, 27, 29–31. Moreover, early-stage diagnosis of AD represents a significant challenge due to a lack of definitive biomarkers and an overlap of biomarkers with other similar neurodegenerative diseases 17. There are currently several protein-level biomarker candidates for AD, such as β-amyloid and tau proteins, with high diagnostic accuracy having been reported 29. For example, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins have been observed in the brains of AD patients 14, 25–26, 32. Although many studies have been conducted at the protein level searching for potential biomarkers for the disease, however, the glycosylation of proteins has not been well-documented 13.

In this work, we present global profiling of N-glycans from CSF using as little as 10 µL with highly sensitive LC-MS in conjunction with permethylation to further enhance sensitivity. Moreover, we employed C18 cartridges and an online purification system coupled with LC-MS to purify released N-glycans from CSF. We applied this technique to CSF samples from AD patients as well as disease-free controls with 4 different cohorts: female AD patients, disease-free female controls, male AD patients, and disease-free male controls.

Experimental

Materials

Iodomethane, sodium hydroxide beads, acetic acid, and ammonium borane complex were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Hypersep C18 cartridges (100mg) were obtained from Thermo Scientific (San Jose, CA). Empty micro spin columns were purchased from Harvard Apparatus (Hollison, MA). Peptide: N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was acquired from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Solvents including HPLC grade water, acetonitrile, methanol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg, PA). CSF samples for both AD and controls were acquired from Golden West Biologicals Inc. (Temecula, CA)

N-glycan Release

A 50 µL sample of CSF was diluted with 50 µL of 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 7.5) then denatured in boiling water for 15 minutes. After the sample had cooled to room temperature, 1 µL of PNGase F (1000 U) was added and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 18 hours. After incubation, the samples were dried using a Labconco CentriVap benchtop vacuum concentrator (Kansas City, MO).

Released Glycan Purification

In order to discard various components of the matrix including de-glycosylated proteins and lipids, purification of glycans using C18 cartridges was performed. The following procedure was adopted from Palmigiano et al. 23. Dried samples were resuspended in 5% acetic acid for C18 glycan purification. C18 cartridges were washed with methanol, then equilibrated with 5% acetic acid. Resuspended samples were applied to C18 cartridges and washed with 5% acetic acid three times while all flow-through was collected and dried using the vacuum concentrator.

Reduction of Glycan Reducing Ends

To avoid complex chromatographic peaks produced by α and β anomers from the reducing end of the glycans, purified glycans were reduced. This was accomplished by the addition of 10 µL of 10 µg/µL ammonium borane complex solution, followed by incubation at 60°C for one hour. After incubation, residual borane was removed by the addition of methanol, generating methyl borate that was evaporated while drying in the vacuum concentrator.

Permethylation of Released and Reduced Glycans

Reduced N-glycans were subjected to solid phase permethylation 24. Dried glycans were first resuspended in 30 µL of DMSO, 1.2 µL of water, and 20 µL of iodomethane. The solution was applied to micro spin columns packed with sodium hydroxide beads that were subsequently incubated at room temperature for 25 minutes. After the initial incubation period, 20 µL of iodomethane was applied to the spin columns and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes. Permethylated N-glycans were collected and resuspended in aqueous mobile phase for LC-MS/MS analysis.

LC-MS Analysis

An LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) was coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Permethylated N-glycans were first desalted with an online purification system using a C18 Acclaim PepMap 100 column (75 µm × 2 cm, 3 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size) (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Purified permethylated N-glycans were separated using a C18 Acclaim PepMap RSLC column (75 µm × 15 cm, 2 µm particle size, 100 Å pore size) (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Samples were desalted using an online trapping system with 3 µL/min flow rate with 0.1% formic acid and 2% acetonitrile in water for the first 10 minutes. Then, to facilitate the separation of permethylated N-glycans, a 10-port valve was switched by connecting the trap column to a C18 reverse phase column. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water, while mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Mobile phase B was held at 20% with 350 nL/min for the first 10 minutes, at which point it was increased to 42%. Next, mobile phase B was increased from 42% to 55% from 10 minutes to 50 minutes, then increased to 90% for 5 minutes, and finally reduced to 20% for another 5 minutes. The mass spectrometer was set to full scan mode, with a scan range from 700 to 2000 m/z, and a mass accuracy within 10 ppm with the mass resolution set at 100,000.

Data Analysis

Relative quantitation of glycans is frequently utilized to investigate glycan expressions 33. To perform relative quantitation using Xcalibur 4.2 (Thermo Scientific) software, extracted ion chromatograms of each glycan structure, including all possible adducts such as sodium and ammonium adducts, were generated. To profile N-glycans in the samples, relative quantitation was chosen to observe broad profiles of N-glycans expressed in the CSF. The m/z values of target glycan structures as well as their corresponding adducts were applied to generate extracted ion chromatograms (EICs). The areas under the curve of these EICs were integrated and summed, then divided by the sum of all detected glycan structures, to articulate the ratio of each glycan expressed in the sample 5, 33–34. To investigate variation in glycan expression between the cohorts, T-tests were used to identify statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) differences in glycan structures. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to aid in visualization of differences between the cohorts. PCA is often used in biomarker research to discover differences in two sets of samples; in this case, between disease-free controls and AD patients as well as differences between two genders 35–37. For receiver operating characteristic (ROC) – area under the curve (AUC) analysis, Origin 2019 Graphing &amp; Analysis (OriginLab, Wellesley Hills, MA) was used.

Results and Discussion

Establishment of CSF N-Glycan Profiling Method

Low protein levels present in CSF18 pose a significant challenge to the study of glycan expression. The reported concentration of total protein in human CSF is approximately 300–700 µg/mL 18, which is in agreement with our bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay where a protein concentration of 657 ± 6.37 µg/mL was observed for pooled human CSF. However, the majority of these proteins are albumin (&gt;50%) and immunoglobins (&gt;15%), making it difficult to study the glycosylation of less abundant proteins that may act as unique biomarkers in disease development and progression 20. Moreover, Pan et al. have previously reported the identification of approximately 1,500 proteins in CSF with only about 200 of them being glycoproteins, indicating that the majority of proteins in CSF are non-glycosylated 20. Therefore, it is crucial not only to have sufficient sample material, but also to utilize highly sensitive mass spectrometers for sample analysis. Although the low abundance of glycoproteins in CSF presents a considerable analytical challenge, it is worth studying the glycomes of CSF due to the uniqueness of the fluid and its biological and neurological significance. The proteins that are present in CSF are unique for several reasons, including the diffusion of proteins and peptides from blood through the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and the production and carriage of proteins in the choroid plexus (CP) to the CSF from blood. Moreover, CSF acts as a medium between the brain and the CP via the ependyma, which is permeable to macromolecules like proteins 38–39. Therefore, CSF is a unique biological fluid with an exclusive source of proteins and other metabolites that may demonstrate neurochemical and biochemical changes in the central nervous system 19.

Another challenge is that the complex matrix of CSF can impose high chemical noise during MS analysis, which interferes with analyte signals and hinders precise quantitation. This complex matrix is composed of various lipids, salts, small molecules, and proteins 39 and must therefore be removed from the analytes for precise analysis. For this purpose, both C18 cartridges and an online purification system were utilized in this study. The C18 cartridges were used after enzymatic digestion to remove hydrophobic interferants, such as proteins and lipids, while the highly hydrophilic glycans were not retained on the hydrophobic C18 stationary phase 23. The online purification system was employed for desalting purposes as well as to discard residual matrix components. Previously, an online purification system for permethylated glycan analysis demonstrated enhancement of detection sensitivity 40. This approach was first subjected with an injection amount equivalent to 10 µL of pooled CSF to the LC-MS system to demonstrate the feasibility of the technique, using the lowest possible sample volume since CSF is difficult to acquire. Quantitative N-glycan profiling from 10 µL of pooled CSF are exhibited in Figure S-1, where 72 N-glycans were relatively quantitated. The use of 10 µL of CSF for N-glycan profiling was an improvement from previous studies where 25 µL41, 50 µL 42, 75 µL 43, 200 µL 22, 44 or 250 µL 45 of CSF were used for N-glycan profiling. This improvement is perhaps due to fewer sample preparation steps which prompted minimal sample loss, as well as enhancement of sensitivity by online purification of permethylated glycans. Moreover, the permethylation technique was used in conjunction with a highly sensitive mass spectrometer which facilitated sufficient signal for glycan profiling with a lower sample volume.

Application to Clinical Samples

To demonstrate the application of this approach, a total of 16 individual samples were analyzed representing 4 cohorts: four male controls, four female controls, four male AD patients, and four female AD patients. Because AD is an age-dependent disease, samples were carefully chosen from older patients (average age of female controls: 63 ± 7, male controls: 67 ± 17, female AD: 77 ± 7, male AD: 75 ± 9). This was critical in order to avoid age and gender bias, as the glycosylation of proteins in humans can vary by gender and age. In serum, core fucosylation is higher in females than in male counterparts, while branching fucosylation in females is lower than in males 46. Bisecting GlcNAc is expressed higher in males than in females 46, while AD occurrence in females is higher than in males 47–48. Therefore, it is important to study each gender separately to avoid any bias as well as to investigate the gender discrepancy in the occurrence of the disease. Gender glycosylation differences in CSF were observed in this study. A PCA plot of disease-free controls from both genders (Figure S-2) shows the genders can be distinctly separated, which highlights that N-glycosylation in CSF between the two genders is dissimilar.

Differences in the expression of glycans can be observed in the chromatograms of the AD and control samples. For example, Figure 1a, which depicts the representative EICs of female AD patients and disease-free female controls, shows decreased expression of Glc4Man3Gal2NeuAc2 in CSF from AD when compared to disease-free controls. Additionally, the female control displays a higher expression of Glc5Man3Gal3NeuAc3 in comparison with its disease state counterpart. Similar observations can be made of the male AD and control samples that are displayed in Figure 1b. With respect to Glc5Man3Fuc1, a higher expression of Glc4Man3Fuc1 can be observed in AD compared to control. To observe differences in broad N-glycan profiles between AD and controls, all possible N-glycan expressions were relatively quantitated, as displayed in Table S1–4.

PCA was employed to facilitate the visualization of differences between disease-free control and AD patients. It is a commonly used chemometric tool to analyze the differences between two sets of data with multiple variables. Figures 2a and 2b exhibit PCA plots of females and males, respectively, while Figure S-3 depicts a PCA analysis of combined genders. PCA plots also indicate the reproducibility of the replicates, as each of the points for replicates are tightly clustered. Interestingly, when the PCA was plotted with both genders combined, disease-free controls’ and AD patients’ samples were indistinguishable. Differences in gender between the disease and control samples became more noticeable in the PCA plots when the plots were generated separately by gender. As shown in Figure 2a for female and Figure 2b for male, distinct differences between the disease-free control and AD groups were observed. Female controls received negative PC1 scores while AD samples received positive PC1 scores. On the other hand, male controls received negative PC1 and PC2 scores while AD samples received positive PC1 and PC2 scores. This observation is similar to what previous studies have reported, in which both Gizaw et al. 49 and Stanta et al. 42 examined gender differences in glycosylation in CSF. As shown in Figure S-3, disease-free controls and AD clusters were not distinguishable when the genders were combined to generate a single PCA plot.

Differences in individual glycan expression between the two cohorts were also investigated using a T-test as well as heat maps to help visualize differences between the groups, as depicted in Figure 3. Relative abundances for N-glycans with statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.05) are noted in Table 1 for female and Table 2 for male. In total, 15 individual structures were found to be different in their expression between the two cohorts for female, and 10 individual structures for males. As displayed in Figure 3, heat maps show the expression of individual glycans with p&lt;0.05, expressed either over or under, between the two cohorts. For females, 8 out of 15 structures were fucosylated, with 5 showing over-expression in AD and 3 showing under-expression in AD. As for sialyated structures, all 4 structures showed over-expression in AD. On the other hand, for males, 7 out of 10 structures were fucosylated, with 5 showing over-expression in AD and 2 showing under-expression in AD. Four out of 10 structures were sialylated, with 2 of them over-expressed in AD and 2 under-expressed in AD. In total, there were 5 N-glycans that were under-expressed and 10 N-glycans that were over-expressed in female samples with AD. As for male samples, AD samples exhibited over-expression of 8 glycans while 2 glycans showed under-expression. From this list, box graphs were plotted for the 5 most abundant N-glycans to aid the visualization of the over/under-expression of individual glycans, shown in Figure 4a (female) and 4b (male). For females, Glc5Man3Fuc1 was over-expressed in AD while the other 4 (Glc2Man5, Glc5Man3Gal3NeuAc3, Glc4Man3Gal1Fuc1, Glc4Man3Gal2NeuAc1) were under-expressed in AD. For the males, three N-glycan structures (Glc2Man5, Glc4Man3Gal2NeuAc1, Glc4Man3Gal1Fuc1NeuAc1) showed lower in relative abundances in AD, while the other two (Glc5Man3Gal3Fuc1NeuAc2, Glc5Man3Gal3Fuc1NeuAc1) displayed higher abundances in AD.

To further investigate the reliability of these glycan expressions as potential biomarkers, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot is shown in Figure 4c (female) and 4d (male). A ROC plot is a useful diagnostic tool that is widely utilized to differentiate two sets of data (i.e. disease state vs. disease free) by plotting sensitivity versus specificity 50. Thus, ROC plots provide information about whether the subject in question as a potential diagnostic marker can be specific and accurate to the disease state 50. With ROC plots, the area under the curve (AUC) is often determined to reveal the accuracy of the test 51. An AUC value of closer to 0.5 indicates that the test is not a good diagnostic tool, whereas an AUC value closer to 1 suggests the opposite, that the test is a good diagnostic indicator 51. In this study, AUC values for each structure from Figure 4a and 4b were determined. For females, Glc5Man3Fuc1, Glc4Man3Gal1Fuc1, and Glc4Man3Gal2NeuAc1 displayed an AUC value of 1, and the other two structures (Glc2Man5 and Glc5Man3Gal3NeuAc3) had AUC values of 0.95 and 0.93, respectively. As for the combined structures, the AUC value was determined to be 0.99, an indication that these structures were highly distinguishable between disease-free controls and AD. In the case of males, three structures (Glc2Man5, Glc4Man3Gal2NeuAc1, and Glc5Man3Gal3Fuc1NeuAc1) received AUC values of 0.92, 0.99, and 0.98, respectively. The remaining two structures (Glc4Man3Gal1Fuc1NeuAc1 and Glc5Man3Gal3Fuc1NeuAc2) had AUC values of 0.87 and 0.82, respectively. The AUC value for the 5 combined male structures showed an AUC value of 0.92, suggesting that they are effective in differentiating AD and disease-free controls. However, as determined by AUC values, the female AD state is slightly more likely (0.99 vs. 0.92) to be distinguished by using these N-glycans as markers than in males.

The total expression of different types of glycans was also compared. Figure S-4 shows a comparison of glycan types between control and AD groups. Bisecting GlcNAc (p=0.01) and fucosylated (p=0.001) glycans were expressed higher than controls in females, while high mannose structures (p=0.02) were under-expressed in females with AD. For males, meanwhile, only high mannose structures (p=0.048) were shown to be expressed more in controls. As for sialyated N-glycans, a lower level of expression was observed in the CSF of AD patients. The decrease in expression was not statically significant for both genders (female: p=0.097, male: p=0.18), although some studies have suggested lower sialyltransferase activity in the brains of AD patients 52. But, particularly in females, the higher abundance of fucosylated and bisecting GlcNAc glycans could suggest that the higher activity of fucosyltransferase as well as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases in the Golgi may play roles in AD. Moreover, the decrease in high mannose type N-glycans suggests that N-glycans become more matured in AD for both genders. However, it should be noted that the results shown in this work are only preliminary given the small sample size. The intent of this work is to demonstrate a glycomics method applicable to CSF with a minimal sample volume and then to apply such method to real clinical samples.

Conclusion

In this work, we performed comprehensive N-glycan profiling from CSF using as little as 10 µL of sample volume, which is an improvement from previous studies. This was accomplished by combining several techniques, including released N-glycan purification using C18 cartridges, permethylation, nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography, and highly sensitive mass spectrometer. Then, this workflow was applied to clinical samples. N-glycan profiles of CSF from AD patients were compared to age-matched CSF from disease-free controls for each gender to examine glycosylation changes in CSF, which is highly related to biochemical changes in the central nervous system. The expression of each glycan was compared between AD and disease-free controls to investigate glycan regulation in CSF. Using PCA, N-glycan profiles of AD patients were distinguishable from disease-free controls when samples were analyzed separately by gender, which suggests that gender plays a role in identifying AD. ROC-AUC analysis also suggests that various N-glycans that differ in relative abundance can be used to distinguish disease-free controls and AD. Moreover, higher abundances of fucosylated and bisecting GlcNAc structures were observed in females.
