Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder and affects about 48 million people worldwide and is the cause of 60%–70% dementia, particularly in people over 65 years old. Without prevention or treatment, the disease slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually lost the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. Unfortunately, there is no drug available to stop or reverse the progress of AD so far. While 70% of the risk of AD is believed to be genetics, recent studies found that environmental and lifestyle factors may play a role in the development and course of AD and physical activity might help to reduce the risk of cognitive decline of AD. In this special session, we invited 5 world well-known clinical and basic scientists who are specialized in AD studies to present most recent discoveries of biomarkers for AD (Dr. Hampel et al.1), newest drug development for AD (Dr. Vassar 2), potential anti-Tau therapy for AD (Dr. Takashima 3), microbiome as a novel therapeutic approach for AD treatment (Dr. Lukiw 4), and exercise preventing AD (Drs. Shen and Li 5).

AD does not occur in one day, it develops slowly from mild, moderate to severe type of AD over years. Indeed, the initial symptoms of AD are often confused with normal ageing, such as wandering, getting lost, repeating questions, taking longer to complete normal daily tasks, as well as personality and behavior changes. How to identify the early stage of AD and develop prevention tools to stop or slow down the progress of the disease is critical. The biomarkers for AD diagnosis at early stage will provide objective and reliable measures of disease progress. Dr. Hampel is an international recognized leader for discovery of biomarkers for AD. In his manuscript entitle of “Biomarker-guided classification scheme of neurodegenerative diseases”, he and his colleagues presented unbiased descriptive classification system of neurodegenerative dementia including AD and clinical and biomarker information. 1 Such important information would allow the characterization and identification of AD even at the earliest asymptomatic preclinical stage through population-based screening.

Although there is no drug can stop or prevent AD yet, there are several therapeutic candidates have been actively developed over the last few years, including inhibitor of bête secretase (BACE). BACE is a key enzyme for cleaving APP, a major protein associated with AD. Blocking BACE in animal models showed a great effect on reducing AD pathology. Dr. Vassar is one of the 4 scientist/groups who first discovered BACE in 1999 when his discovery published in Science while other 3 groups published in Nature as same time.6–9 Since then, Dr. Vassar has been working on BACE as the best and most possible drug for AD. In his article entitle of “BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer disease”, we will learn the most current drug discovery of BACE inhibitor from animal to clinical trials.2

Another major pathology of AD is Tau protein which forms special twisted strands as tangle and destroys neurons in the brain. Understanding how Tau protein cause AD and developing anti-Tau therapy has been the major focus of Dr. Takashima’s research. 3 In his paper entitle of “Mechanism of neurodegeneration through tau and therapy for Alzheimer’s disease”, he demonstrated his studies on Tau in AD and offer novel insights about tau aggregation pathology, particularly suggesting inhibition of Tau aggregation might be a promising compound for blocking AD progression.

“From gut to brain” is a new discovery and a novel approach for AD research. Increasing evidences indicate that the human microbiome may contribute to the regulation of the communication between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and central nervous system. Studies of AD demonstrated that dysregulation of microbiome in GI track could be associated with AD progress and “good gut bacteria” may delay AD associated cognition impairment. Dr. Lukiw was one of scientists who first reported the microbial-neuronal interaction in AD.10 In his short article entitle of “The microbiome, microbial-generated proinflammatory neurotoxins, and Alzheimer’s disease”, we will learn the most recent publications on the potential contribution of microbiome-generated factors in proinflammatory signaling in the brain and the recent recognition of the beneficial effects of dietary fibers on the human GI tract microbiome with specific reference to AD neuropathology. 4

Lastly, we will like to know whether exercise can prevent, stop or reverse AD. During the past decades, extensive studies have demonstrated that exercise is good and important for people with AD, particularly for reducing some of AD symptoms. In general, exercise may help elderly people to sleep, lower anxiety level, as well as perverting from fall. Interestingly, recent studies found that exercise or regular physical activity might also play a role in AD. Here, we have invited Dr. Shen who is a world well recognized AD research scientist to present the most recent finding on exercise and AD. In his article entitle of “What do we know from clinical trials on exercise and Alzheimer’s disease?”, he gathered the findings from the most current clinical trials on exercise in AD and focused on the effects of physical exercise, cognitive stimulation and combination of both physical and cognitive training on protection and rescue cognitive decline in people with AD. 5

Together, we are very lucky and excited to have a group of outstanding scientists from the world to share their most recent discoveries or visions on AD research and potential of exercise intervention on prevention and treatment of this disease. We hope this special session of Journal of Sport and Health Science would not only provide our readers a view of AD, but also opens a new window to search future approaches by exercise to stop and serve the disease.
