Background

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) usually requires the pre-enrichment of modified proteins or peptides. However, recent ultra-deep whole proteome profiling generates millions of spectra in a single experiment, leaving many unassigned spectra, some of which may be derived from PTM peptides.

Methods

Here we present JUMPptm, an integrative computational pipeline, to extract PTMs from unenriched whole proteome. JUMPptm combines the advantages of JUMP, MSFragger and Comet search engines, and includes de novo tags, customized database search and peptide filtering, which iteratively analyzes each PTM by a multi-stage strategy to improve sensitivity and specificity.

Results

We applied JUMPptm to the deep brain proteome of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and identified 34,954 unique peptides with phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and others. The phosphorylated peptides were validated by enriched phosphoproteome from the same sample. TMT-based quantification revealed 482 PTM peptides dysregulated at different stages during AD progression. For example, the acetylation of numerous mitochondrial proteins is significantly decreased in AD. A total of 60 PTM sites are found in the pan-PTM map of the Tau protein.

Conclusion

The JUMPptm program is an effective tool for pan-PTM analysis and the resulting AD pan-PTM profile serves as a valuable resource for AD research.

pmcIntroduction

Mass spectrometry (MS)-based profiling of the whole proteome and posttranslational modifications (PTM) [1] is a powerful method to provide molecular insights in biology and human disorders, such as cancer [2–5] and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [6,7]. The latest MS platform allows deep analysis of proteome (~10,000 proteins) from mammalian cells and tissues [8–10], while PTM profiling often requires pre-enrichment of targeted modified peptides [11], such as phosphopeptides [12,13] and GG-tag ubiquitinated peptides [14,15]. The PTM peptide information is usually not extracted from whole proteome data, although the deep whole proteome profiling can produce millions of MS2 spectra in one experiment. After default database search, a significant portion of high-quality spectra remain unassigned, which may contain peptides modified by PTMs not considered during the search [16,17]. For example, Chick et al., identified thousands of PTMs including phosphorylation, oxidation, and methylation from the whole proteome (1.1 million MS2 spectra; ~9,500 proteins identified) from the HEK293 cell line [16].

To explore PTM peptides from “enrichment free” whole proteome datasets, one may select a search engine from many database search tools [18], preferably from recently developed programs (Table S1), including Comet [19], MSFragger [20], TagGraph [17]; open-pFind [21], and MetaMorpheus [22]. By adopting an open search strategy with wide mass tolerance (typically ± 500 Da) [16], open search allows the “single-shot” identification of large number of peptides with a wide range of mass shift (delta mass), a significant fraction of which can be mapped to known PTMs (e.g., 80+ for phosphorylation). However, this open search strategy is undertaken at the cost of significantly elevated search space compared to the conventional “closed search” strategy (typically with ±10 ppm or 0.01 Da mass tolerance). One effective solution is to use a hybrid approach as in MetaMorpheus [22], which begins with an open search to guides the selection of the most promising PTM types, followed by closed searches of each PTM for maximal sensitivity. In addition to restricting search space in the closed search, the number of input spectra can also be reduced in parallel. Because a significant portion of MS2 spectra is already identified during conventional proteome analysis, only the unmatched spectra should be considered for subsequent PTM analysis. Furthermore, this multi-stage process can be accelerated by removing low-quality spectra, as the spectrum quality can be readily evaluated using de novo sequencing tags. Indeed, the combination of these strategies has proven effective for large search space analysis in proteogenomics [23], but have not yet been implemented for pan-PTM analysis. Here we report the JUMPptm pipeline to incorporate these strategies and its application to the analysis of AD human brain tissues.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with ~6.5 million American patients but with limited treatment [24]. Early biochemical studies identified Aβ plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles as the two pathological hallmarks of the disease, and the formation of the neurofibrillary tangles is attributed to hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein [25]. Advanced proteomics platforms allow the investigation of the AD proteome [9,10] and PTM subproteomes, such as phosphorylation (&gt;30,000 sites) [9,26], ubiquitination (&gt;4,000 sites) [27], and N-glycosylation (&gt;2,000 sites) [28]. Targeted analysis of tau PTMs revealed complex modification patterns, including 55 phosphosites, 17 ubiquitinated, 19 acetylated and 4 methylated sites) in human AD cases [29]. However, due to intrinsic low stoichiometry of most PTMs, enrichment of modified peptides prior to MS analysis is required, which needs optimization for each PTM type. Therefore, only a few PTM types have been unbiasedly investigated for AD. Systematic profiling of all major PTM types (pan-PTM analysis) during AD progression is currently not available.

To perform pan-PTM analysis of AD samples, we assembled the new JUMPptm pipeline to take advantages of JUMP (de novo tags) [30], MSFragger (open search) and Comet (closed search of multiple PTMs). We then used JUMPptm to explore pan-PTM types in an ultradeep whole proteome dataset, which contains about 6 million MS2 spectra with &gt;14,000 unique proteins using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, extensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC/LC) and MS/MS [9]. The dataset includes replicates of 5 groups in 10 TMT channels: (i) low pathology controls (LPC), (ii) high pathology controls (HPC) but without cognitive impairment, (iii) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), (iv) AD with high pathology, and (v) progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) with only tau pathology. From this whole proteome dataset, we identified more than 30, 000 unique peptides of various PTM types. TMT-based quantification further identified hundreds of PTM peptides significantly associated with disease progression. In addition, we quantified 60 PTM sites for the Tau protein (including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination). The JUMPptm tool is freely available for research community (https://github.com/surPoudel/JUMP-ptm).

Materials and Methods

The global design of the JUMPptm algorithm

JUMPptm aims to identify PTM events from unmatched spectra after conventional peptide analysis of the whole proteome. By default, JUMPptm assumes that the whole proteome data has been analyzed by the JUMP suite [30], which outputs the identification of peptides/proteins, and the high-quality (HQ) unmatched spectra with de novo tags. Such HQ spectra (input #1) are taken as JUMPptm input, and searched against a list of PTMs specified by the user (input #2) with the multi-stage database search strategy [23] using Comet [19]. The PTM list can be guided by the results from an open search using MSFragger [20]. JUMPptm exports the PTM peptide identification with TMT-based quantification. This integrative pipeline is implemented in four individual modules as described below.

Input file specification and open-search-guided PTM list

To facilitate subsequent stages of PTM analysis after default peptide analysis, the latest JUMP suite (v1.13.1; https://github.com/JUMPSuite/JUMP) outputs three files after analyzing a whole proteome dataset: i) the accepted unique proteins (.fasta format); ii) HQ unmatched spectra generated by the spectrum QC module [23] (.ms2 format); and iii) de novo amino acid tags for each high-resolution MS2 spectrum (.tags format). The identified proteins are used to generate a customized database to restrict the search space, and the latter two files are input files for JUMPptm. To allow flexible input files (e.g., in case the de novo tag file is not available especially for low-resolution MS2 data), JUMPptm provides an option to turn off the tag filtering function, despite comprised performance of PTM identification. Note that all the HQ spectra are mass-corrected by JUMP analysis, allowing narrow mass tolerance (e.g., &lt; 6 ppm) for subsequent PTM identification.

To unbiasedly select the PTM list for JUMPptm analysis, open search analysis was performed for a small portion of samples (e.g., 5 representative fractions from &gt;100 fractions) using MSFragger (Release 3.4) [20]. The search results were further annotated using two independent approaches: i) an in-house program that iteratively matches each delta mass to those from the Unimod database [31]; and ii) the PTM-Shepherd algorithm [32]. Finally, ranked by the total peptide number for each PTM type, we accepted a PTM list consistently identified by both methods for the JUMPptm analysis. In addition, PTM types of interest may be manually added into the list.

Module 1: Multi-stage database search with tag matching

The JUMPptm parameter file allows users to specify a multi-stage strategy for PTM analysis by Comet [19], generally with one PTM type for one stage. The parameter file starts with the total number of stages (or PTM types), followed by the specifications for stage-specific analysis, including the PTM form (e.g., phosphorylation), modified residues (e.g., STY), mass shift (e.g., 79.966331 Da), and the maximum modified residues allowed for each peptide (e.g., 3). For each stage, database search is performed against HQ unmatched spectra (.ms2 format from previous JUMP search) by Comet (2021.01 rev. 0). Comet is selected because of i) high computational efficiency for peptide-to-spectrum pattern matching; and ii) open source for flexible code programming and customization. The Comet results are annotated with de novo tags (.tags format; output by JUMP). Briefly, tag sequences were extracted during the first stage database search by JUMP, which labels pairs of peaks that have mass difference of one specific residue. These peak pairs are linked together to construct long tag sequences with flanking masses. The tags may be generated from either N-terminal fragments (e.g. b ions) or C-terminal fragments (e.g. y ions). The program recursively enumerates all possible tags from one spectrum. Matching of the JUMP-based tags with Comet-based PSMs from the same MS2 spectra follows these criteria: (i) string match of amino acids on either b or y ion series, and (ii) the match of the flanking mass associated with each tag. The output of this module are Comet results stored in .pepXML format with matched JUMP tag information.

Module 2: Tag-assisted peptide-to-spectrum filtering

To improve peptide identification sensitivity and accuracy, we include tag information for PSM filtering by revising our previous PSM filtering procedure [23,33]. Briefly, low-scoring PSMs are first removed as random matches, followed by precursor ion mass accuracy filtering (typically &lt; 5 ppm after peptide-based calibration). To perform target-decoy based false discovery rate (FDR) estimation [34,35], the PSMs are grouped by the number of matched tags, then by other features including the precursor ion charge state, peptide lengths and the number of modifications, and finally filtered by search score to achieve user specified level of FDR (e.g., 1%).

Module 3: Consolidation of multi-stage search results

The stage-specific results of accepted PSMs/peptides are merged, during which redundancy are removed by selecting the best-scored PSM across all analyzed stages. All PSM information, including peptide features, search and PSM filtering results, are recorded in a text file, that serves as input for the TMT quantification step. As a summary, two additional spreadsheets are generated: i) with unique peptides (defined as a unique combination of amino acid sequence and PTM sites) by merging multiple PSMs; and ii) with unique proteins inferred based on the maximal parsimony rule [36].

Module 4: TMT-based quantification

Our previous procedure of TMT-based quantification [37] is customized for PTM peptide analysis using unenriched whole proteome data. Notably, while conventional TMT-based quantification assumes equal loading amount across all samples, this assumption may not hold true for PTM peptides. Thus, for accurate loading bias correction, we borrowed non-modified peptides to re-estimate the normalization factors. Briefly, this module includes: i) merging of PSM peptides with the non-modified ones from initial JUMP analysis, ii) extracting TMT reporter ion intensity for each PSM, iii) TMT reagent impurity correction, iv) outlier PSM removal, v) loading bias correction, vi) relative intensity summary of peptides from PSMs, and vii) finally deriving absolute intensities of each peptide by multiplying the relative intensities with the grand-mean of three most abundant PSMs. The output of this module is an Excel spreadsheet and text file of unique peptides, with all output columns from Module 3 plus TMT quantification information.

Pan-PTM analysis of deep AD proteome

The deep AD proteome was recently published that quantified different disease groups of AD and related dementia by TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS (accessible from the PRIDE database (www.proteomexchange.org) via accession PXD007985) [9]. Briefly, the TMT labeled samples were fractionated by offline basic pH reverse phase LC (120 fractions), and each of these fractions was analyzed by the acidic pH reverse phase LC-MS/MS (3 hr gradient run per fraction) followed by MS (120,000 resolution) and MS/MS (60,000 resolution) analysis. The resulting 6 million high resolution MS2 spectra enabled the quantification of ~200,000 peptides from over 14,000 unique proteins. The JUMP-qc module [23] was applied to the initial JUMP search results, resulting in ~3 million HQ spectra that cannot be identified during the conventional whole proteome analysis. These HQ unmatched spectra were stored in .ms2 format for each fraction (n = 105 fraction runs in total), along with de novo tags in each MS2 spectrum recorded in .tags format (one file per run).

Additional pre-analysis was performed prior to PTM identification. Briefly, the following commonly observed peptide forms and artificial modifications were considered: peptide trypticity (partially or non-cleaved peptides), the over- (side reactions) and under-labeling of TMT reagents, as well as (artificial) chemical modifications including formylation (by formic acid buffer), and carbamylation (by urea).

The HQ spectra that passed the above pre-analysis were retained for pan-PTM analysis. To select the most promising PTMs, five representative fractions were chosen for open search analysis by MSFragger. Notably, acetylation and methylation preferentially occur on lysine residues, which prevent TMT labeling. Therefore, static mass shift for TMT modification on lysine (+229.162931 Da) was changed to dynamic modification during the analysis of these two PTMs. Otherwise, static TMT modification was set for both N-terminus and lysine. Other key search parameters include ±10 ppm mass tolerance for both precursor and product ions, fully tryptic peptides, dynamic modification of oxidative Met (+15.9949 Da), and the consideration of b, y ions and NH3/H2O neutral loss. With these defined parameters, JUMPptm automatically performed database search, filtering, and quantification.

To identify differentially expressed (DE) PTM peptides across disease stages, one-way ANOVA followed by Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) FDR estimation [38] were performed. DE peptides were defined by both BH FDR and minimal fold change (two null standard deviations estimated from technical replicates) of AD versus LPC group, with the final combined FDR estimated based on sample permutations [13,39]. The DE peptides were then analyzed by JUMPn [40] for subsequent co-expression clustering and network analysis [40].

Results and Discussion

JUMPptm: an integrative pipeline to analyze PTMs from MS data

Although recent open search provides a simple strategy for a wide range of PTM analysis, the open search method uses a much larger search space than the “closed search” strategy. For example, during a closed search, thousands of peptide candidates (median = ~3,900) are typically considered to match each MS2 spectrum; in contrast, the peptide candidates are increased by over 600 folds for open search (median = ~2,400,000; Fig. S1A). This significantly increased search space leads to two major caveats: i) high computational burden because database search time often linearly correlated with search space; and ii) elevated random matches that compromise identification sensitivity (Fig. S1B). These caveats can be largely addressed by a multi-stage search method [23]: when coupled with spectrum QC, the multi-stage method reduced database search time (Fig. S1C and S1D), and achieved more accurate FDR estimation of PTM identifications (Fig. S1E).

To balance peptide search space and PTM identification sensitivity, we implemented three advanced features underlying the architecture of the multi-stage JUMPptm pipeline (Fig. 1A, Fig. S2). JUMPptm takes the advantages of multiple search engines: (i) de novo tags and HQ unmatched MS2 spectra by JUMP, as JUMP is a tag-based hybrid search tool [30], (ii) rapid open search by MSFragger to prioritize a PTM list (Table 1), and (iii) optimized PTM search tool in a closed mode by Comet.

Briefly, for a whole proteome raw dataset, conventional JUMP search is performed to identify unmodified peptides, unmatched HQ MS2 spectra, and associated tags. In parallel, a fraction of the raw dataset is subjected to MSFragger open search to rank PTMs by abundance. Then the outputs of the JUMP and MSFragger analyses are used for a multi-stage, closed search by Comet, which contains four modules for PTM peptide identification, filtering to reduce FDR, and TMT-based quantification (see the details in Materials and Methods). A “divide-and-conquer” strategy is implemented to enhance JUMPptm analysis, during which the HQ spectra are analyzed for each PTM type in parallel (with de novo tags used for improved matching specificity), then results from all stages of PTM types are merged for consolidation, followed by TMT-based quantification. It should be mentioned that a pre-PTM stage is inserted to remove peptides of partial- or non-trypticity, and artificial PTM peptides mediated by buffer components (e.g., formic acid and urea, Table 1).

Finally, JUMPptm exports the identified peptides with PTM information in a text table, showing the peptide sequences with PTM sites with delta mass, peptide-spectrum match (PSM) counts, information of tags, matching scores, protein accessions and PTM types (Fig. 1B). For a TMT dataset, TMT-based quantification for each channel is output as additional columns. As examples (Fig. 1C), we display the TMT quantification of two PTM peptides that are increased in AD samples: one tau phosphopeptide, and the GG-tagged peptide from K11-mediated polyubiqutination chains [14], consistent with the accumulation of tau phosphorylation [41] and ubiquitination in Alzheimer’s disease [42].

Improvement of PTM identification by de novo tags

De novo tags derived from high-resolution MS2 spectra prove to be powerful to distinguish true PSMs from false positives [30], but deriving tags often requires intensive computational power. JUMPptm re-uses de novo tags already derived by JUMP during the initial search of non-modified peptide analysis. To match the JUMP-based tags with Comet-based PSMs from the same MS2 spectra (an example in Fig. 2A), we select the tags by the following criteria: (i) string match of amino acids on either b or y ion series (e.g., PTSPVTSETG from y ions), and (ii) the match of the flanking mass associated with each tag (e.g., nTMT-S from b ions).

To systematically evaluate the advantage of de novo tags in filtering the Comet-based PSMs to reduce FDR, we have adapted the target-decoy strategy [34,35] and analyzed the relationship of target and decoy PSMs with matching scores (E values) and the total number of detected tags in each spectrum. As expected, the matching scores, shown as −log10(E values) significantly correlates with the number of matched tags on the global scale (Pearson r = 0.67; Fig. 2B). However, we do observe that some PSMs with high tag numbers (e.g., &gt;5) fail to produce high matching scores, which may be discarded during the score-based PSM filtering. Interestingly, tag alone provides exceptional discrimination power of separating targets from decoys (Fig. 2C), consistent with previous analysis [30]. Indeed, do novo tags require the continuity of ion series, which are rarely observed in random peak matches [43]. In contrast, conventional spectrum matching algorithm (e.g., Comet’s E-value calculation) does not consider such continuity [44], explaining the significant yet imperfect correlation between these two metrics (Fig. 2B). Therefore, in complementary to matching scores, we integrate the tag information during our PSM filtering step within JUMPptm to improve PTM peptide identification.

Application of JUMPptm to pan-PTM analysis of AD

To investigate the protein changes during AD progression, we applied the JUMPptm pipeline to our previously published whole proteome profiling of human postmortem brains [9]. The profiling utilized the 10-plex TMT-LC/LC-MS/MS approach, in which the 105 fractions were collected for LC-MS/MS runs, acquiring about 6 million MS2 spectra. Five distinct disease groups were quantified with replicates, ranging from the normal control (LPC), asymptomatic (HPC), mild symptomatic (MCI), to end-stage of the dementia (AD). Another different form of dementia (PSP) was also analyzed, which only shows tau pathology without amyloid plaques. Each sample was pooled from 9 human cases to improve statistic power [9], so 90 cases were used in 10 TMT channels in this study. We hypothesize that multiple types of PTM events can be identified from such a ultradeep brain proteome dataset, some of which may be associated with the development process of the disease.

Using the ultradeep AD dataset, we performed the JUMPptm analysis to identify pan-PTM peptides. After the initial JUMP search, we accepted about 3 million HQ unmatched MS2 spectra for the multi-stage, closed search using a PTM list of 9 modifications (Table 1). A total of 34,954 non-redundant PTM peptides were identified, including protein deamindation (n = 15,492), oxidation (n = 6,508), dioxidation (n = 1,324), phosphorylation (n = 6,773), acetylation (n = 881), methylation (n = 1,445 mono-,852 di- and 204 tri-forms), and ubiquitination (n = 234) (Table S2).

To further validate the identification PTM peptides, we compared the 6,773 phosphopeptides identified by JUMPptm to the published list of 46,600 phosphopeptides in the same set of samples by the TiO2-enrichment method [9]. About 89% of the 6,773 peptides were covered by the published list of enriched phosphopeptides (Fig. S3A). We further examined the remaining non-overlapped 11% phosphopeptides, and found that they were still reliable (as exemplified by one case in Fig. S3B), as their distributions of neutral loss ions (HPO3/H3PO4; Fig. S3C) and de novo tags (Fig. S3D) are similar to those of the enriched phosphopeptides. The missing peptides by the enrichment may reflex the bias during the purification of phosphopeptides [45].

In addition, we evaluated the quantification accuracy of PTM peptides by two ways: (i) examining known positive controls. For example, the pTau (T231) and Ub chain (K11) peptides were significantly accumulated only in AD cases (Fig. 1C); ii) global analysis to show high reproducibility of replicates (R2 &gt; 0.9; Fig. S3C). Taken together, over 34K PTM peptides were successfully identified and quantified by JUMPptm during AD progression.

Quantitative pan-PTM peptides during AD progression

To study the dynamic change of pan-PTM peptides during the AD progression, we used stepwise protocol to define peptides of differential expression (DE), cluster these DE peptides into different groups, followed by the analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) modules (Fig. 3A). We identified 482 DE PTM peptides from the 34,954 peptide list in different disease stages (FDR &lt; 10%, highlighted in Table S2). These 482 DE peptides were mapped to 327 individual proteins, with the Tau protein containing the largest number of DE PTM peptides (n = 29) of phosphorylation (n = 13), deamidation (n = 11), acetylation (n = 3), oxidation (n = 1) and ubiquitination (n = 1).

Then, the 482 DE PTM peptides were grouped into eight co-expression clusters by the WGCNA algorithm [46] (Fig. 3B), with clusters 1-4 displaying up-regulated and clusters 5-6 down-regulated in AD. Despite the heterogeneity of PTM quantification in clinical samples, we observed highly consistent patterns of PTM accumulations along disease progression. Cluster 1 (n = 53) gradually increases during AD development; cluster 2 (n = 52) dramatically increases since the early stage starting from HPC; cluster 3 (n = 139) only increases in the AD group; and cluster 4 (n = 51) shows a waving pattern in AD progression. Strikingly, the AD down-regulated patterns mirror all the four up-regulated patterns (clusters 5-8), implicating an inter-connected networks that are co-dysregulated along stages of disease progression [9]. Moreover, we found that the composition of PTM types varies in each cluster, consistent with diverse functions of different PTM types (Fig. 3C).

To further dissect the functions of each co-expression cluster, we superimposed these modified proteins onto a comprehensive human protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify functional modules using the JUMPn algorithm [40]. A total of 30 PPI modules were defined in in these 8 clusters (Table S3, p &lt; 0.01). For example, in cluster 7 (downregulated PTMs in AD), module 4 was significantly enriched in the pathway of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria, including a large number of acetylation events on ATP5A1, ATPB, ATP5H, ATP5J, NDUFA10, etc., as well as other PTMs of phosphorylation, methylation, oxidation and deamidation (Fig. 3D). The results suggest the mitochondrial dysfunction in the end stage of AD, largely consistent with previous finding of downregulation of mitochondrial function from whole proteome analysis of AD brain [6,7] and even blood samples [47,48].

Finally, we examined the PTM peptides on the Aβ peptide and tau protein that form aggregates in AD brain. The residue of N27 is deamidated in the Aβ peptide (Fig. S4A) and the deamidation is accumulated in AD brain (Fig. S4B). Asparagine deamidation is implicated to contribute to amyloid formation [49]. More dramatically, a large number of tau PTM sites (n = 60) are determined by JUMPptm, revealing 32 novel PTM sites when compared with three previous reported deep PTM analyses [9,41,50] (Table S4). Among these PTM sites, about half sites show upregulation, including phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) and other forms of modifications (acetylation, methylation, oxidation, deamidation, and ubiquitination, Fig. 4B), consistent with many publications highlighting the role of tau modifications in the aggregation process [6,41]

Conclusion

Here we have established a JUMPptm method to extract pan-PTM information from MS data in unenriched whole proteome analysis. JUMPptm takes advantages of the best features of JUMP, MSFragger and Comet search engines, and merges them together in a streamlined protocol, with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, JUMPptm has been used to identify 34,954 unique PTM peptides of 9 different modifications, out of which 482 are significantly altered in AD progression. It should be noted that PTMs in the brain are sensitive to confounding factors (e.g., post-mortem interval) during sample collection [6,51]. Understanding of PTM functional roles requires further investigated and validated in disease models, such as cell cultures and mouse models. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first pan-PTM profiles along AD progression, and the identified PTMs and network modules provide a large-scale resource for future functional investigation.

(A) JUMPptm takes unmatched high quality (HQ) spectra and associated de novo tags, as well as identified proteins as a customized database from previous JUMP database search, along with a list of specific PTMs from MSFragger open search. JUMPptm then performs step-wise closed database search with tag matching and the consideration of individual PTMs using the Comet program. The results are filtered by tag assisted target-decoy approach. Filtered PTMs are then merged to generate PTM identification list, followed by quantification (e.g., TMT).

Significance statement:

Recent ultra-deep whole proteome profiling generates millions of spectra in a single experiment, from which post-translationally modified (PTM) peptides may be directly identified without pre-enrichment. Here we develop JUMPptm for identifying PTM peptides from mass spectrometry data of unenriched whole proteome. Notably, the software integrates the advantages of multiple search engines of both open and closed search strategies, and streamlines the analysis from database search to peptide quantification and data summary. Applying JUMPptm to the deep brain proteome of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) generated the quantitative pan-PTM landscape during disease progression. The JUMPptm software is freely available for the research community.
