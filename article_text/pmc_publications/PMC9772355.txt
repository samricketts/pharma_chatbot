Background:

Hospice use is lower among ethnic/racial minorities in the United States, though little is known about trends, associated factors and duration of hospice use by Mexican-Americans.

Aim:

The purpose of this study is to examine Mexican-American characteristics associated with hospice stay, both ≤ and &gt; 7 days.

Design:

This retrospective cohort study used data from the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the ORs and 95% CIs for hospice stay among Mexican-Americans, both ≤ and &gt; 7 days.

Setting and participants:

The first cohort (N = 970) includes H-EPESE participants who died between 2004 and 2016 who had Medicare parts A and B. The second cohort (N = 403) includes participants who completed the H-EPESE survey within the last 2 years of life.

Results:

Although hospice use increased among Mexican-Americans between 2004 and 2016 (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.19–2.97), 38% of participants died within the first week of hospice care. Mexican-Americans in New Mexico and Arizona were 2–4 times more likely to use hospice than those in Texas and Colorado. Dementia was associated with hospice use (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.11–1.94). Characteristics, like church attendance and living alone, were not associated with hospice use.

Conclusions:

The substantial proportion of Mexican-Americans with 7 days or less of hospice use underscores the need for early palliative/hospice intervention to mitgate variation in use.

pmcIntroduction

Hospice use is increasing in the United States (US), although substantial variation in use exists by ethnicity and race. Between 2015 and 2019, the number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in hospice care increased each year and hospice length of stay increased.1,2 Between 2020 and 2022, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospice utilization is not clear.1 In 2019, Medicare decedents of Hispanic ethnicity had lower rates of hospice use than non-Hispanic whites, with 43% of Hispanics receiving hospice care at the time of death compared to more than 53% of non-Hispanic whites.1,3,4 Little is known, however, about the patterns of hospice use among US Hispanic sub-populations, including Mexican-American elderly. Country of origin among people of Hispanic ethnicity in the US is related to health outcomes in old age, including variation in functional limitation and life expectancy.5 Despite the myriad of studies showing low hospice use and aggressive end-of-life care among US Hispanics, it is important to disaggregate the Hispanic ethnic group and study subpopulations.

In this study, findings from the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE), a large multi-state longitudinal study, are linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) data to shed light on Mexican-American health, individual characteristics and state of residence as it relates with hospice use, both ≤ and &gt; 7 days. Understanding the trends of hospice use among Mexican-Americans can guide clinical practice and inform clinical guidelines and health system policies aimed at optimizing the timeliness and access to high-quality end-of-life care for the growing population of older Mexican-Americans. This aim is in line with the World Health Organization goal to increase access to palliative care.6

Methods

Data and Study Population

In this study, data was used from the H-EPESE, a longitudinal study of older Mexican-Americans living in the southwestern United States. The original cohort (1993/94 Wave) included 3050 Mexican-American participants aged 65 and older living in Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and California. A new cohort of participants aged 75 and older was added to the H-EPESE at Wave 5 (2004/05). Follow-up interviews for the original (1993/94) and new (2004/05) cohorts are completed every 2 to 4 years. The most recent wave of data collection was completed in 2016. An interviewer obtained written or oral consent of the participant, or a proxy family member in case of decreased capacity, prior to the interview. The H-EPESE was approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch (IRB # 92–85, 27 February 1992; IRB # 16–0014, 9 February 2016) and the current study falls under Exemption 4 of the National Institute of Health guidelines.7

For this study, the H-EPESE was linked with the following CMS files for 1999 to 2016: Master Beneficiary Summary files, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files, Outpatient Standard Analytic files, Carrier files and Hospice files. A detailed description of the procedures for accessing and the linking the CMS files to the H-EPESE has been published previously.8,9 The CMS files were used to identify participants who died between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2016, determine Medicare enrollment status and identify participants who ever had a Medicare claim that included a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia (ADRD).

Figure 1 shows the selection of the primary cohort (Cohort 1). Data for a total of 2585 participants were linked with CMS files. Participants included were those who died between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2016 according to the Master Beneficiary Summary file; were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the year prior to death; and met the eligibility criteria for the Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) indicator variable for ADRD (see Measures).10 Cohort 1 included a total of 970 decedents.

A secondary cohort (Cohort 2) was created to examine the association between hospice use and demographic, social and health characteristics not included in CMS files. Of the 1540 participants who died between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2016, 731 had a survey interview within 2 years of death. We then selected participants who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B in the last year of life and who had no missing values for the variables of interest from their last survey. Cohort 2 included a total of 403 decedents.

Measures

Hospice Use in the Last Month of Life

The Medicare Hospice files 2004–2016 were used to identify decedents who made use of hospice services within their last month of life. We defined the main outcome as a binary variable indicating whether a decedent had any hospice claim with a discharge date within 30 days prior to the date of death. Among those who used hospice, we defined a secondary outcome as a binary variable (≤7 days, &gt; 7 days) indicating length of hospice stay.

Medical Conditions

The Chronic Conditions Segment of the Master Beneficiary Summary file was used to identify decedents who were eligible for CCW indicators for ADRD, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), depression and cancer (lung, colorectal, prostate, breast and endometrial cancers) prior to their date of death. The Chronic Conditions Segment includes flag variables for 27 different medical conditions. The flag variables were created using previously developed algorithms CMS.11

Covariates

Additional variables from the CMS files included age at death (75–80, 81–85, 86–90, &gt;90 years), Medicaid eligibility and year of death (2005–2007, 2008–2010, 2011–2013, 2014–2016). The Wave 5 survey was used for information on decedents’ sex, nativity (US-born vs foreign-born), years of education (0, 1–6, ≥7) and language of interview (Spanish or English). We also categorized decedents by state of residence: Texas, California, New Mexico, Colorado, or Arizona.

Variables that came from the decedent’s last survey prior to death (Cohort 2) included living alone (yes, no), marital status (married, not married), church attendance in the prior year (never, sometimes, frequently), having a limitation in activities of daily living (ADL) and scoring lower than 18 points on the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE).

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics, including counts and percentages, were used to describe the study cohorts. Bivariate analyses were performed to assess the differences in independent variables by hospice use and estimate the unadjusted rates of hospice use. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the ORs and 95% CIs of hospice use by decedent characteristics (demographic, social and health characteristics). All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Results

The primary cohort (Cohort 1) had 970 participants (Figure 1). Of these, 59.4% were female and 40.6% male. All participants were over age 75, most (59.6%) were aged 86 or older at the time of death. A majority of participants lived in Texas (74.9%), qualified for Medicaid (62.2%) and were born in the US (59.7%). Most participants had 1–6 years of education (56.1%). Seventy-four percent of participants completed the H-EPESE survey in Spanish. More than half of participants had been diagnosed with either ADRD (53.1%), diabetes (53.6%) or heart failure (54.6%). A minority of respondents had been diagnosed with stroke (12.7%), COPD (27.5%) or cancer (9.1%). Participants were less likely to use hospice if they died in 2005–2007 compared to 2014–2016 (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.19–2.97). Participants were more likely to use hospice if they had a diagnosis of ADRD (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.11–1.94) or died in Arizona (OR = 4.59, 95% CI = 1.10–19.2) or New Mexico (OR = 2.93, 95% CI = 1.40–6.17), compared to Colorado or Texas (Table 1).

Of the participants who entered hospice, 38.4% had a length of stay of ≤7 days (Figure 2, Table 2). Of the 238 female participants in Cohort 1, 35.7% had a hospice stay of ≤7 days, compared to 42.7% of male participants. Among the 126 participants dying at age 90 or older, 32.5% had a hospice stay of ≤7 days, compared to 48.8% of those aged 75–80. A larger percentage of participants dying in California (41.1%), Colorado (40.0%) and Texas (39.5%) used hospice for ≤7 days or less compared to those in Arizona (14.3%) and New Mexico (22.7%). Rates of hospice use of ≤7 days were similar across language of interview (36.3–39.3%) and nativity (37.7–38.8%). Those with 1–6 years of education had a lower rate of hospice use ≤7 days (35.3%) compared to those with more (40.4%) or less (43.7%) education. Of the 260 patients with Medicaid, 36.1% had a hospice stay of ≤7 days compared to 43% of those without Medicaid. A lesser percentage of participants with a diagnosis of cancer (27.5%) or ADRD (35.1%) used hospice for ≤7 days compared to those with COPD (40.4%), diabetes (42.9%), heart failure (43.5%) and stroke (51.0%). However, none of these differences were statistically significant in the multivariate model.

In Cohort 2, H-EPESE survey data was used to research the nuances of participant life associated with hospice use (Figure 3). The characteristics of participants in Cohort 2 were comparable to those in Cohort 1, aside from the prevalence of ADRD (Table 3). Most (56.4%) were aged 86 or older at the time of death, lived in Texas (75.4%), qualified for Medicaid (65.3%) and were born in the US (58.8%). Most participants had 1–6 years of education (57.3%) and 76% completed the H-EPESE survey in Spanish. More than half of participants had been diagnosed with diabetes (51.1%) or heart failure (52.4%). A minority of respondents had been diagnosed with stroke (11.7%), COPD (24.1%) or cancer (10.2%). Compared to Cohort 1, a lesser percentage of participants in Cohort 2 were diagnosed with ADRD (44.9%), although 45.4% of participants in Cohort 2 had a MMSE of &lt;18 points. No significant relationship was found between hospice use and marital status, presence of high depressive symptoms, ADL disability, living alone, attending church or visiting a doctor within the last year. Cognitive impairment increased the likelihood of hospice use (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.07–3.25).

Discussion

Main Findings/Results of the Study

Mexican-American hospice use increased between 2004 and 2016. Mexican-Americans dying in 2014–2016 were 1.88 times more likely to use hospice than those dying a decade earlier (95% CI = 1.19–2.97). Both in this study and on the national scale, hospice use has increased over the last 20 years.1 This finding represents a broad trend in increased hospice use secondary to, in part, changes in Medicare payment models, and is in line with the Institute of Medicine and Worldwide Hospice Palliative Care goals of decreasing aggressive end-of-life care.4,12–14

Despite this increase in use, more Mexican-Americans have a hospice length of stay of ≤7 days compared to national data, with 39% of Mexican-American participants dying within the first week of hospice care compared to about 28% nationally.4 Our study findings are consistent with Pan-American Health Organization reports: approximately 38% of Mexican-American participants (of whom 60% were born outside of the US) were on hospice for ≤7 days prior to death.15 Shorter hospice stays provide fewer opportunities for patients and families to benefit from the services. Unexpectedly, the characteristics of participants with hospice stays ≤7 days, including language of survey, nativity and hospice diagnosis, did not differ significantly from those with a longer stay. This suggests that the healthcare system is likely most responsible for determining hospice length of stay.

Also suggesting healthcare system disparities, geographic variation in hospice use was observed, with participants in Arizona and New Mexico being 2 to 4 times more likely to use hospice than participants in Colorado and Texas. This finding is likely related to regional variation in healthcare utilization and access to healthcare. Patients living in or near urban areas are more likely to have aggressive end-of-life care compared to those in rural areas.16,17 There may also be regional differences in systemic inequities. In Texas, Hispanic and black cancer patients are more likely to receive aggressive end-of-life care and die in the hospital compared to non-Hispanic whites.18,19 It is not clear if this trend is consistent across states studied. There are also known differences in access to care between the states studied. Texas was the only state studied that has not expanded access to Medicaid. Financial stressors are associated with decreased awareness of hospice among minority populations and lower utilization of hospice.20–22 The geographic disparity should be studied in more detail to better describe regional differences in end-of-life care in minority populations and ways to mitigate the effects of financial hardship on end-of-life choices.

At the participant level, consistent with national data, a diagnosis of ADRD was associated with hospice use among Mexican-Americans in Cohort 1.14 Although this relationship was not significant in Cohort 2, it is likely that ADRD was underdiagnosed, as more participants in Cohort 2 had moderate to severe cognitive impairment on the H-EPESE survey than had received a diagnosis of ADRD. On a national scale, Medicare beneficiaries with dementia receive the greatest number of days of hospice care (median of 55 days) compared to those with other primary diagnoses.4 Dementia is also the most common end-illness of those admitted to hospice, replacing lung cancer, which was the most common diagnosis in 2008.14

Among Mexican-Americans, cancer is not associated with hospice use; this pattern reflects both disparities in care as well as broader trends in cancer care (Table 2). Hispanic-Americans are less likely to receive cancer care in a dedicated cancer center and less likely to use hospice with a cancer diagnosis compared to non-Hispanic whites.3,23 Overall, nationally, as newer treatments have emerged, the percentage of Medicare hospice patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer dropped from 53% in 1998 to 31% in 2008.14

In Cohort 2, H-EPESE data was used to examine the association between hospice use and several individual characteristics of participants. No association was found between hospice use and participants’ language of choice, nativity, ADL disability, frequency of seeing a doctor or frequency of attending church (Table 2). The lack of association between frequency of church visits and hospice care is echoed by other studies. In a study of 291 surrogate decision makers, few religious variables were associated with end-of-life pRef.24 The lack of association in this study between hospice use and either language of interview or nativity may be related to demographic changes in the US. In 2016, there were an estimated 40 million Spanish speakers in the US, up from 17.3 million in 1990, as well as an increase in the number of Spanish-speaking healthcare providers.25 The lack of significance between hospice use and several core patient characteristics points again to the impact of healthcare system factors on the variation in hospice use and early hospice referral.

Potential areas for future study include an analysis of Medicare data for correlates for hospice use among a larger population of Mexican-Americans in Arizona and Colorado, which had the highest and lowest rates of hospice use respectively. Also, Hispanic populations experienced disproportionately higher rates of Covid-19 mortality compared to non-Hispanic whites.26,27 Shifts in hospice utilization among Mexican-Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic should be examined along with the ongoing impact of the pandemic on hospice utilization among minority communities. The impact of financial hardship on the H-EPESE population at the end-of-life should be examined. The results of that study may point toward a targeted area for interventions aimed at increasing knowledge and utilization of hospice among H-EPESE participants at end-of-life.

Strengths and Weaknesses

The primary strength is that this study is a population-based survey of Mexican-Americans linked with CMS files to examine potentially modifiable and actionable factors associated with time trends, duration and rate of hospice care use across several states and with a consideration of social, spiritual and cultural determinants of health.

The primary weakness of this study is that it is not easily applicable to a large number of Hispanics living in the US, such as Cuban Americans or those of Puerto Rican heritage, whose social, cultural and health profiles are different from those of our sample.5 Also, the study included only participants ≥ 75 years old and cannot be used to discuss trends in hospice among younger Mexican-Americans. Additionally, undocumented Mexican-Americans in the United States are not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid and therefore the experience of and access to hospice is not well known in this population.28

What this Study Adds

This study reinforces the findings of others; the location of care (hospital, region, state) at the end of life affects hospice use. The novel finding is the lack of association between individual qualities, like church visits, functional status, language of survey, nativity and hospice use. The substantial proportion (38%) of Mexican-Americans who were on hospice for a week or less before death underscores the need for early palliative/hospice team consultation for those diagnosed with serious illnesses and terminal conditions. The use of a standardized process for palliative consults (eg Surprise Question) in health systems can reduce the variability across states in hospice use and improve the timeliness of hospice referral among Mexican-Americans.

Conclusions and Implications

Globally, there is wide variability in both hospice use and hospice length of stay before death, suggesting local barriers to and facilitators of palliative and hospice care.15,29 Disparities in hospice use among Mexican-Americans can be addressed by increasing access to palliative care (including expanding the use of telehealth), encouraging all healthcare providers to discuss end-stage illness and increasing access to alternative sites of hospice care for those with financial hardship or low family support.28,30–32 Given the higher rates of inpatient care use by minority populations at end-of-life, hospital staff must actively work to improve communication and understanding.18 Healthcare providers of all specialties must recognize and counsel patients on signs of end-stage illness, especially in areas with poor access to healthcare.31 The disparities in hospice use and timely hospice referral among Mexican-Americans can prompt efforts to continue improving access to hospice, as the decision to use hospice, as found in this study, is not associated with individual characteristics such as country of origin or language of communication.

Key Statements

What is already known about the topic? More people in the United States are using hospice than 20 years ago.

Longer hospice stays allow patients and families to benefit more from the services.

Hispanic Americans are less likely to use hospice than non-Hispanic whites.

What this paper adds Hospice use is increasing among Mexican-American participants, but hospice use less than 7 days prior to death is more common in this group compared to nationally.

Factors like state of residence affect hospice use among Mexican-American participants.

Personal characteristics (like living alone, level of education, attendance at church, language of survey, place of birth) were not associated with likelihood of hospice use.

Implications for practice, theory, or policy The substantial proportion (38%) of Mexican-Americans on hospice for a week or less before death underscores the need for early palliative/hospice team consultation for Mexican-Americans with serious illnesses and terminal conditions.

Use of standardized process for palliative consults (eg Surprise Question) in health systems can reduce the variability across states in hospice use and improve the timeliness of hospice referral among Mexican-Americans.
