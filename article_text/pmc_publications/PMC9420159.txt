Objectives:

Agitation is the most common behavioral symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affecting about 40–60% of the AD population, yet there are no FDA approved therapies for the myriad of behavioral or psychological symptoms of dementia. There is growing evidence from naturalistic studies that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for agitation in AD patients who are refractory to pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions. Despite the existing evidence, ECT remains underutilized due to stigma, lack of education, and concerns regarding adverse cognitive effects. Randomized controlled clinical trials of ECT are an opportunity to provide high quality evidence of ECT as a safe and efficacious treatment for agitation in the AD population. We describe the methods for the Electroconvulsive Therapy in Alzheimer’s Dementia (ECT-AD) study, which utilizes a novel, simulated ECT control group to conduct a single-blind efficacy study of ECT for the treatment of agitation and aggression in individuals with moderate to severe AD.

Methods:

We discuss the rationale, study design, methodology, ethical and practical challenges, and management strategies in utilizing a simulated ECT group as the comparator arm in this randomized controlled trial of ECT in AD-related treatment refractory agitation and aggression.

Conclusions:

Validation of the safety and efficacy of ECT in patients with advanced AD with refractory agitation and aggression is necessary. This can be accomplished through creative formulation of simulated ECT groups that effectively maintain the blind while providing scientific integrity.

pmcIntroduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease accounting for 60–80% of worldwide dementia cases1. In the United States, an estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and over are currently diagnosed with AD, and this number is predicted to increase to 12.7 million by 20501. The clinical syndrome of AD is not limited to impairments in memory and cognition, as behavioral symptoms affect up to 97% of AD patients over the course of their disease2. These can include agitation, aggression, and depressive symptoms3,4. These challenging behaviors increase the burden on the patient, caregiver5, and healthcare systems3,4. Agitation, specifically, is the most common behavioral symptom of AD6, affecting about 40–60% of AD patients7,8. The International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) developed a consensus provisional definition of agitation in cognitive disorders characterized by behavior suggesting emotional distress, including excessive motor activity, physical aggression, or verbal aggression9. These agitated behaviors can be either aggressive or non-aggressive, with aggressive agitated symptoms including fighting, throwing, grabbing, cursing, and screaming, and non-aggressive symptoms including restlessness, pacing, wandering, and repetitive questioning10,11. The severity of these behavioral symptoms can damage relationships, increase caregiver burden12, and accelerate time to institutionalization1. In addition, there is a negative economic impact, with agitation accounting for 12% of total health and social care costs for people with dementia13.

Despite the pervasiveness of agitation in AD, there are no FDA-approved medications for this indication. Current recommendations for first-line treatments include behavioral and psychosocial interventions and environmental modifications. These therapies require substantial implementation efforts and are not highly effective in severe agitation. Because behavioral interventions have variable effectiveness and require education and training of caregivers, psychotropic medications are often utilized off-label to treat agitation in AD. However, antipsychotics carry an FDA black-box warning indicating increased mortality in the dementia population. Antidepressants, such as SSRIs, carry less risk of adverse effects but their efficacy for agitation in AD remains unclear. In addition, the use of many antidepressants may be limited due to cardiac-conduction adverse effects14. Thus, there is a clear imperative for developing safe and efficacious treatments for severe agitation in AD.

A potential treatment for refractory agitation in AD is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT involves the application of electrical pulses to the scalp in order to excite brain cells and induce a brief seizure under controlled conditions and general anesthesia15. This electrical stimulation results in neuromodulatory effects which have been safely established in older adults with major depressive disorder (MDD)16,17. The neuromodulatory efficacy of ECT may translate to the treatment of behavioral symptoms, specifically refractory agitation, in the Alzheimer’s population. Single case reports and retrospective case series support the potential efficacy and safety of ECT in the treatment of agitation and aggression in individuals with AD, with ECT significantly decreasing agitation18–28 and improving global functioning20,28,29. More broadly, studies of ECT in the general dementia population reveal that ECT is effective at reducing behavioral symptoms, including agitation and aggression30,18. These past studies were not adequately controlled, likely due to the ethical and practical challenges associated with designing a valid control arm for a study of ECT.

Findings from published case reports, retrospective reviews, and prospective observational studies provide evidence to further investigate the safety and efficacy of ECT for the acute treatment of severe agitation in dementia using a rigorous methodological approach. In this article we discuss the study design, methodology, ethical and practical challenges, and management strategies in conducting a randomized controlled trial of ECT in a vulnerable population with treatment refractory agitation.

Historical Background of Sham ECT

Neurostimulation studies use the term “sham” to designate control groups that do not receive active treatment. Sham ECT was first reported in the 1950s as involving anesthesia control groups in studies of ECT in patients with depressive subtypes of several psychopathologies31–33. Though active ECT was more effective than sham ECT in treating depressive symptoms, 38%31 and 44.4%32 of sham participants still recovered in each study, compared to 57.1%31 and 62.5%32 of active ECT participants. Sham ECT methods continued into the 1960s to 1980s, where ECT studies on patients with depressive subtypes utilized anesthesia-based sham groups34–39. The UK ECT review group conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis that showed that real ECT was significantly more effective than sham ECT40. Rasmussen K. reviewed the characteristics of the sham ECT studies in depression and discussed the phenomenon of unusually high sham response given the fact that most patients undergoing ECT were severely depressed and/or suffering from treatment-resistant depression41. Controlled ECT studies in neurological disease populations began in the 1980s with severe Parkinson’s disease, where sham ECT consisted of anesthesia and muscle relaxation. An improvement of parkinsonian symptoms in the active ECT group occurred, believed to be the result of modulation of dopamine receptors caused by active ECT42. There were no similar sham controlled ECT studies in the US for over three decades, in part because of ethical considerations associated with sham ECT, namely the risk general anesthesia carries. This risk may be reflected in our anecdotal reporting of the Institutional Review Boards’ caution to approve studies using general anesthesia for sham ECT, perhaps because of the importance of choosing the right anesthesia technique to avoid potential harm to patients43. The paucity of this research during the past three decades, as well as the evident inadequacy of anesthesia-based sham ECT to act as a believable control condition, warrant the revitalized research efforts into how to effectively craft an ECT control group. This sentiment is felt even by ECT critics who speak to the possible consequences of ECT, including cardiovascular complaints and death44,45 the point that ECT advocates must conduct research studies with randomized, placebo-controlled design44.

A 2018 review of ECT versus clozapine noted the lack of sham ECT in randomized controlled trials46 and stated that only one trial in the United States had utilized blinding techniques for raters47. A 2003 study in India utilized a sham ECT group in a randomized controlled trial in individuals with schizophrenia; the sham group received just anesthesia. The active ECT group performed significantly better on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) compared to sham48. A recent study in Brazil conducted a randomized controlled ECT study in the clozapine-resistant schizophrenia population. The sham group was given just anesthesia, and they experienced worsening hallucinatory behavior compared to the active ECT group, illustrating some of the potential risks of using anesthesia in sham ECT designs49. A recent fMRI study investigating the neurocognitive mechanisms of ECT in patients with MDD utilized a sham ECT condition in which patients received full anesthesia and muscle relaxants, and stimulation electrodes were applied but unplugged. This study found differential effects across groups, as active ECT modulated medial prefrontal hyperactivity during encoding of negative affective information compared to sham subjects50.

To date, no studies have utilized a sham ECT design in patients with AD. Apart from the broader ethical concerns associated with administration of anesthesia absent a clear clinical purpose, the potential safety risk in AD clinical trials is further magnified given the patients’ impaired cognitive status. It is reasonable to suggest that anesthesia may not be a necessary component of sham ECT in trials involving advanced dementia patients, as their severe memory impairment, makes it less likely that the study blind would be compromised by their report. Thus, ECT research that involves moderate-to-severe AD patients offers a unique opportunity to design novel sham ECT procedures that are safer (i.e., no anesthesia) and more appropriate for cognitively impaired individuals. The current study describes a promising approach in this regard.

ECT-AD Methods

The ECT-AD study is a multi-site, NIH-funded, single-blind, randomized controlled trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of ECT in severe and treatment refractory agitation and aggression in AD. We describe the methodology of this study that compares active ECT to simulated ECT (S-ECT). The study includes 9 ECT sessions, administered 3 times per week, for inpatient older adults aged 55–89 with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease, defined by a Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE51) score of ≤15, and treatment-resistant agitation and aggression, measured by a Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Nursing Home Version (CMAI52–53) score of ≥5 on at least one item of aggression or a physical nonaggressive item (items 1–11, 14, 15, 22–24). Treatment-resistance is defined by failing at least three pharmacological interventions for behavioral symptoms that come from different drug classes used at therapeutic doses for at least two weeks, or one week if concurrent medications, within two months of enrollment. Participants may not have diagnoses of co-morbid delirium, non-AD dementia according to the NIA-AA criteria for dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, active substance use disorder within the past 6 months, or treatment with neurostimulation therapies within the past 3 months. Participants must also be medically cleared for ECT, comprehend the English language, and have a legal authorized representative (LAR) able to give informed consent. In this study population with advanced AD, participants are assessed for their ability to assent or dissent, and the LAR is required to provide informed consent.

Eligible participants are randomized to an active ECT plus usual care (ECT+UC) or simulated ECT plus usual care (S-ECT+UC) group. Participants in the ECT group receive right unilateral (RUL) ultra-brief (UB) pulse width (0.25ms Thymatron; 0.3ms MECTA) ECT for the first 6 treatments. Following the 6th treatment, lead placement may be switched to bilateral (BL) with brief pulse width (0.5–1.5ms Thymatron/MECTA) if there is lack of efficacy, defined as no improvement or cognitive worsening by a score of 4–6 on the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC54–55). Additional information regarding the ECT methods can be viewed in Figure 1, alongside the S-ECT methodology to be detailed below.

The “usual care” treatment approach is based on the DICE algorithm56. It emphasizes (1) evaluating and clinically managing medical co-morbidities possibly associated with agitated disturbances, (2) reducing medications with anticholinergic effects, (3) maximizing environmental support, (4) monitoring medication use, and (5) utilizing as needed (PRN) medications (gabapentin, lorazepam, trazadone, risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine) for acute agitation.

Simulated ECT Methods

Sham ECT was previously considered unethical47 partly because of the lack of active treatment and partly because of the risks of anesthesia. However, the ECT-AD model includes the “usual care” aspect that ensures standard clinical care in the inpatient setting without ECT for the S-ECT arm. In addition, S-ECT does not include use of anesthesia. The S-ECT process closely mirrors the active ECT process in several important ways, involving data collection and storage as well as patient and staff roles.

The inpatient treatment teams and the raters are blinded to the group assignment. Data collected for both ECT and S-ECT treatment groups include vital signs, adverse event monitoring, treatment details, and medication details. These treatment and medication details are documented and kept in subject-specific binders stored in locked file cabinets to maintain the blind. An unblinded study staff member is responsible for the maintenance and storage of data collected for all subjects. This unblinded staff member is responsible for overseeing the transport of S-ECT and ECT subjects to and from the ECT suite, disseminating relevant behavioral scale scores to the primary inpatient psychiatrist, and reporting medical information between other staff members.

Similarities in preparation for ECT and S-ECT procedures are necessary to maintain the blind (Figure 1). Both groups are kept NPO (nothing by mouth) after midnight in preparation for potential active ECT. Both groups receive an intravenous (IV) line access for PRN medications and fluids. Physical signs of IV placement need to be present in both ECT and S-ECT subjects to maintain the blind.

The amount of time spent in the ECT suite is the same for both treatment groups. This length of time mirrors the average length of time it might take a staff member to complete all pre-ECT preparations and ECT treatments. The ECT electrodes, EEG monitoring leads, and bite guards are not utilized in the S-ECT group as they are unnecessary for maintaining the blind for staff and the S-ECT subjects, and their application may trigger more agitation. Conducting gel is placed on the scalps of the S-ECT subjects in identical positions to the ECT active treatment group. Thus, gel residue remains on both groups post-treatment procedures. Gel placement must correspond to electrode placement expected at the treatment number. Our specific study design mandates that after the sixth treatment, if there is no improvement or cognitive worsening on the ADCS-CGIC, electrode placement and parameters change from RUL placement with ultra-brief pulse to BL placement with brief pulse.

Both ECT and S-ECT groups spend a similar amount of time in the recovery room post-treatment. This time estimate reflects how long a patient in the ECT group needs to regain consciousness following post-anesthesia drowsiness. All subjects spend up to one hour in recovery post-treatment to simulate standard ECT protocols.

Despite the similarities in procedures that both groups undergo, one may argue the ECT preparation (electrode placement, ECG) experienced by the active ECT group could result in some clinical impact on the active group. However, we believe that the addition of these preparation steps to the S-ECT patients would potentially cause unnecessary irritation and increase agitation, without the potential benefit of active ECT. S-ECT subjects do experience physical contact with study staff through the above procedures and through medical clearance, laboratory sample collection, and EKG before randomization. That contact may be less than the level of contact that active ECT subjects receive, but it is equitable and does not increase unnecessary risk.

Challenges in Maintaining the Blind

There are multiple workflow challenges that need to be considered to successfully utilize a S-ECT control group. Maintenance of the integrity of the S-ECT group relies upon blinded and unblinded roles. Blinded study staff members include members of the inpatient staff, raters and study doctors completing relevant scales, and the family or LAR of a subject. Unblinded staff members include all ECT unit staff, a coordinator that does not administer study scales, and a study investigator or clinician that does not administer scales. As all communication between blinded and unblinded staff members comes with a risk of accidental unblinding, sites are encouraged to use scripts for interactions between staff members. Outlining appropriate communication helps to ensure that staff do not make comments with unblinding potential. Unintentional unblinding comments can also be avoided by utilizing the unblinded coordinator throughout the study workflow. This coordinator disseminates information between units including medication tolerance, daily behavioral symptoms, and treatment tolerance.

Medication, symptom, and treatment details must be documented in a manner that does not break the blind. Documentation for this information, including specific medications given in the ECT suite (medications for anesthesia, post-ictal agitation, seizure termination) and treatment details, is completed using paper charts. These paper records are stored in a locked file cabinet. The location of this cabinet is up to the discretion of the site, but it is recommended that it too remains on the unblinded ECT unit. As electronic medical records are visible to all staff, they may only contain ECT medications verified as not unblinding (antipsychotics to treat behavioral disturbances, common agents for fluid replacement, pain medications).

The necessity of paper charting by the unblinded staff poses a potential issue for weekend and holiday coverage, as staff members not familiar with study details may work during these shifts. It is the responsibility of a site to ensure that there are back-up unblinded staff members available during weekend and holiday coverage hours who can access unblinding materials if needed. Possible situations that require unblinding during these off-hours include medical emergencies or early termination. If these situations arise during business hours, it is the responsibility of the unblinded coordinator to access a subject’s unblinded files and communicate the unblinding status to the attending physician. This communication can be conducted using a specified unblinding form that relays unblinding information to the attending, who is then responsible for breaking the blind with the patient and LAR. It is unlikely that the unblinded coordinator and attending will be present on weekends or holidays; thus, a site should consider back-up roles for these off-business times so that unblinding can be completed successfully and without threatening blinded information.

If accidental unblinding does occur, study staff will record the occurrence of accidental unblinding in the study documentation. The primary analyses will not be modified for accidental blinding as the intent-to-treat principle is followed; the effect of accidental unblinding on study outcomes will be investigated in additional exploratory analyses.

The integrity of the blind is tested with the patients themselves using a Randomization Questionnaire at the completion of the acute phase of ECT. The Questionnaire asks subjects what treatment they believe they received during the study. Possible response options include ECT, Simulated ECT, and Unable to Provide Answer. If subjects describe the procedure using language such as “electric,” “stimulation,” or “shock,” blinded raters mark that the subject believed they received ECT. The success of the blind is not internally assessed with blinded staff because asking blinded raters to think about what treatment condition each subject is receiving could cause raters to focus on randomization assignments and make assumptions that may influence ratings.

Discussion

The proposed S-ECT method described is feasible but has limitations. The methodology relies heavily upon the cooperation and adherence of patients and staff to maintain the blind. Patients must have a certain level of cognitive impairment that renders any comments about their treatment dismissible, precluding them from breaking the blind. This S-ECT methodology was designed for dementia patients with a specific level of cognitive impairment, that may be difficult to apply to other populations.

It is necessary to provide evidence that ECT is a safe and effective treatment for severe and treatment refractory agitation in AD. Some critics may see a negative connotation in using ECT to treat agitation and aggression. However, the proposed study contains stringent criteria to treat only the most severe treatment-refractory agitation and aggression that have not responded to intensive behavioral interventions and at least three adequate trials of psychotropic medications. Showing critics that ECT is safe and effective requires conducting larger studies that use rigorous methodological approaches with a randomized controlled design. The integrity of such a study relies upon the maintenance of the blind which is difficult when a repeated procedure such as ECT is involved. We describe methods detailing how to manage a study involving an active and a simulated ECT group with AD subjects. In similar vulnerable populations, we must develop innovative and creative designs that can still maintain scientific ethics while utilizing a control group. S-ECT is a creative method that maintains the blind, ensures scientific integrity, and allows for a determination of the clinical efficacy and safety of ECT.
