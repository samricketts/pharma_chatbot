Purpose:

To investigate the association between episodes of critical care hospitalizations and delirium with structural brain changes in older adults.

Materials and Methods:

We included MCSA participants ≥60 years old at the time of study enrollment (October 29, 2004, through September 11, 2017) with available brain MRI and ‘amyloid’ positron emission tomography scans (PiB-PET). We tested the hypothesis that a) ICU admission is associated with greater cortical thinning and atrophy in entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, middle temporal cortex, and fusiform cortex (Alzheimer’s Disease-signature regions), b) atrophy in hippocampus and corpus callosum; d) delirium accelerates these changes, and d) ICU admission is not associated with increased deposition of cortical amyloid.

Results:

ICU admission was associated with cortical thinning in temporal, frontal, and parietal cortices, and decreases in hippocampal/corpus callosum volumes, but not Alzheimer’s Disease-signature regions. For hippocampal volume, and 10 of 14 cortical thickness measurements, the change following ICU admission was significantly more pronounced for those who experienced delirium. ICU admission was not associated with an increased amyloid burden.

Conclusions:

Critical care hospitalization is associated with accelerated brain atrophy in selected brain regions, without increases in amyloid deposition, suggesting a pathogenesis based on neurodegeneration unrelated to Alzheimer’s pathway.

1. Introduction

Hospitalization that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission can be associated with cognitive dysfunction in the elderly [1-3]. Our group found that global cognition declined more rapidly among older adults who were admitted to the ICU during hospitalization than hospitalized patients who did not require ICU care [4]. In addition, cognitive decline was more profound in those who experienced delirium during their ICU admission. Potential causes of this accelerated decline include the underlying illnesses necessitating ICU admission or interventions or physiologic perturbations that can accompany ICU admission (e.g., hypoxia). Alternatively, those at risk for post-hospitalization cognitive decline may also be at risk for ICU admission.

Brain imaging can provide insight into cognitive decline mechanisms in many settings [5]. For example, our group has found that requiring surgery with general anesthesia is associated with a more rapid cognitive decline in older adults compared with those not requiring surgery [6]. In addition, the cognitive decline among those undergoing general anesthesia was associated with cortical thinning in specific brain regions, but not changes in the deposition of amyloid in the brain [7, 8]. Prior studies of patients admitted to the ICU described greater brain atrophy and a higher burden of white matter lesions after discharge [9-12]. However, there is no prior work that compared the images from patients admitted to ICU to patients not requiring ICU admission.

The purpose of this study was to determine the neuroanatomical correlates of the greater cognitive decline observed in our prior analysis of older adults who required ICU admission [4]. We tested the hypothesis that ICU admission would be associated with increased regional cortical thinning and atrophy of both the hippocampus and the corpus callosum. Declines in hippocampal volume are seen in Alzheimer’s disease and with accelerated aging [13]. The corpus callosum is a major interhemispheric white matter pathway which plays a key role in cognitive performance [14]. We also tested two secondary hypotheses: 1) that these changes would be more pronounced in patients who experienced delirium during their hospitalization, and; 2) that they would not be associated with changes in the deposition of cortical amyloid. To evaluate these hypotheses, we utilized data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), a population-based study designed to investigate brain aging among residents of Olmsted County, MN [15]. These data include longitudinal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cross-sectional Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography (PiB PET) data [16-18].

1. Materials and Methods

This study was approved by the institutional review boards of Mayo Clinic and Olmsted Medical Center. At enrollment in the MCSA, all participants provided written informed consent.

1.1. MCSA participants

The MCSA uses the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system infrastructure to enumerate and recruit participants in an age- and sex-stratified random manner [19, 20]. Details of the MCSA design have been previously described [6, 7, 15]. Participants in the MCSA undergo detailed neuropsychological evaluation and receive MRI scanning at baseline and at regular time intervals following enrollment. The present study included MCSA participants age 60 and older at the time of study enrollment (October 29, 2004 through September 11, 2017).

1.2. Demographics, medical and surgical history

MCSA study data include demographics, education, past medical history, and APOE status. Information for all ICU admissions from 5 years before enrollment through December 2017 was extracted from the electronic medical records. For critical care admissions that occurred after enrollment, additional details were obtained including indications for admission, use of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and occurrence of delirium during hospitalization. Delirium was identify using the standardized Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) [21]. In our practice, the CAM-ICU has been applied upon admission and every 12 hours thereafter for all hospitalized patients since January, 2004. All electronically detected positive CAM-ICU scores were also manually reviewed using additional nursing documentation to confirm the delirium diagnosis.

1.3. Structural MRI imaging

All images were acquired on 3T MRI scanners (Signa; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). Cortical thickness from T1 magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) image sequences was estimated using FreeSurfer version 5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). Thicknesses were computed from a total of 34 regions of interest (ROIs) with automated cortical parcellation using the Desikan-Killiany atlas [22].

1.4. PiB-PET imaging

Amyloid PiB-PET imaging was added to the MCSA evaluation after 2008. Given the limited number of participants with multiple PiB-PET scans and intervening ICU episodes we utilized a cross-sectional rather than longitudinal study design to assess whether amyloid deposits differ between those with ICU admission vs. not. For this analysis the most recent PiB-PET scan image was utilized and participants were classified based on whether or not they had an ICU admission during the 10-year period prior to imaging. Details of the the PiB-PET imaging protocol and processing was detailed in an earlier report [16, 23].

1.5. Outcome measures

The primary outcome was cortical thickness in regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease (AD-signature region) [23] which include entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, middle temporal cortex, and fusiform cortex, because we previously determined that exposure to anesthesia was associated with changes in these regions [23, 24]. MRI outcome measures included regional cortical thicknesses of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Finally, we measured hippocampal and corpus callosum volumes, scaled by total intracranial volume. These regions were chosen as being involved in both normal and pathological aging processes [25-27].

The primary PiB PET variable was the global Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) which includes voxel weighted average of median uptake in prefrontal, orbitofrontal, right and left parietal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate/precuneus regions scaled by median of the cerebellar crus gray matter [23]. Cut-point for normal vs. abnormal global cortical amyloid deposition was determined as &gt;1.48 [28, 29].

1.6. Statistical analysis

Cortical thickness in the AD-signature region was the primary MRI outcome. Thicknesses in other cortical regions, including sub-regions of the temporal lobe, and hippocampal and corpus callosum volumes, were secondary outcomes. Repeated MRI outcomes were obtained longitudinally over time. The primary exposure variable was a ICU episode after MCSA enrollment and a subsequent follow-up visit. Continuous MRI outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts and random slopes. The primary fixed effects in the model were time in years since the first MRI and a variable for time since ICU episode. For the latter, the variable is zero for all subjects at enrollment and begins counting time only after an ICU admission. This measures the change in annual slope following ICU admission. Since only a small number of participants had multiple ICU admissions during follow-up, we considered the first ICU admission as the “primary insult of interest” and do not include any terms in the model to account for subsequent admissions.

In our prior study assessing changes in cognitive function we found evidence suggesting that the accelerated decline in cognitive function following ICU admission was more pronounced in those who experienced delirium [4]. To assess whether a similar effect is present on brain structures, we included an interaction term to assess whether the association with ICU admission differed for those who experienced delirium versus not. We present the interaction P-value and summarize the estimated change in slope following ICU admission with delirium and change in slope following ICU admission without delirium. We further compared MRI data for the most recent scan prior to admission in ICU patients who did and did not develop delirium.

For the present study, the first MRI scan after enrollment was considered the “baseline” assessment. All subsequent MRI scans were also used in the analyses. Participants with only a single scan during the study period were included in analyses as their values contribute to the estimation of the intercept. To adjust for recent vascular health, multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, education, marital status, smoking status, alcohol, APOE ε4+ genotype, ‘cardiac and metabolic conditions’ [30], and for previous exposure to ICU (in the five years preceding the first MCSA MRI assessment). Finally, intellectual lifestyle enrichment throughout life is viewed as a protective factor against cognitive decline in the older population and therefore was examined as a confounding variable [31]. Details regarding intellectual enrichment, including its significance and calculations, have previously been described [32]. All covariables were obtained at MCSA enrollment except age and cardio-metabolic conditions, which were obtained at the time of MRI.

For the cross-sectional study of cortical amyloid, the primary end-point of interest was abnormal amyloid based on the most recent PiB-PET image. The exposure variable was the binary variable indicating any critical care admission in the prior 10-years. Data were analyzed using logistic regression with the same covariates used in our main analysis.

Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (Version 9.3, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).

2. Results

2.1. Study population, ICU admissions, and follow-up

The present analysis includes all individuals who were enrolled in the MCSA prior to December 31, 2017, were ≥ 60 years of age at enrollment, and had an MRI assessment (N=2,518). From those participants, a total of 5,596 MRI scans were available for review. Of the 2,518 participants, 123 had at least one ICU admission during follow-up (1 episode in 102 (83%) participants, 2 episodes in 14 (11%) participants; ≥3 episodes in 7 (6%) participants). For these individuals, the median [25th, 75th] duration of follow-up prior to the first ICU admission was 1.8 [0.9, 3.0] years and follow-up after the first ICU admission was 1.8 [1.0, 3.7] years. For the 2,395 participants with no ICU admission the median follow-up was 1.3 [0, 3.6] years (Supplementary Figure 1). Participants who had an ICU admission during follow-up were older, more likely to be male, had a higher frequency of comorbidities, and were more likely to have had an ICU admission in the 5-year period prior to their first MCSA MRI assessment (Table 1).

2.2. Cortical thickness and brain volumes

In adjusted models, ICU admission was associated with faster decline (i.e. more negative slope) of longitudinal MRI measurements (negative estimate implies thinning or loss of volume - Table 2). These changes were not statistically significant (i.e., the 95% CI did not exclude 0) for the primary outcome of thickness in the AD-signature region cortex (estimated change in slope following admission [95% C.I] −0.005 [−0.012 to 0.002] mm per year (P=.14). A summary of the results of the full model including all covariates is presented in Supplementary Table 1. For secondary outcomes, the changes were significant for the temporal (estimated change in slope following admission [95% C.I] −0.006 [−0.012 to −0.0003] mm per year, P=.04), frontal (−0.007 [−0.012 to −0.002] mm per year, P =.01) and parietal (−0.005 [−0.010 to −0.0004] mm per year, P=.03) cortical regions, but not the occipital region (Table 2 and Figure 1, left panel). For subregions in the temporal cortex, changes were significant only for the banks of superior temporal sulcus subregion (BANKSSTS) (−0.006 [−0.012 to −0.001] mm per year, P=.02). Decreases in hippocampus and corpus callosum volumes were both greater following an ICU admission (hippocampus volume: −0.033 [−0.054 to −0.011] cm3 per year, P=.003; corpus callosum volume: −0.019 [−0.032 to −0.005] cm3 per year, P=.009).

Of the 123 ICU admissions, 41 were postsurgical, and 82 were related to medical indications (Table 3). There were 14 patients who had positive CAM-ICU during their admission; all had nursing documentation confirming symptoms/signs consistent with delirium. Patients who experienced delirium had thinner cortex in the AD-signature region (P&lt;.001) and temporal cortex (P&lt;.001), and lower hippocampus (P=.02) volumes in the last MRI scan prior to admission (Table 3, Figure 1 right panel). In analysis of longitudinal changes in thickness, changes in slope following ICU admission were significantly greater in those patients who developed delirium for the AD-signature cortical region and the temporal, frontal, and parietal regions, and 6 of 9 temporal subregions analyzed (Table 4). Changes in hippocampal volume, but not corpus callosum, were also greater in patients who developed delirium

2.3. Cortical amyloid

For analysis of cortical amyloid, there were 1,321 participants with a PiB-PET image available, of whom 184 had been admitted to the ICU during the 10-year period prior to imaging. In adjusted analysis, ICU admission was not associated with amyloid burden: OR (95% C.I.) 0.89 (0.60 to 1.31), P=.54.

3. Discussion

3.1. Key findings

The major findings of this analysis are that compared to persons not admitted to ICU: 1) ICU admission in older adults is not found to be significantly associated with an acceleration of cortical thinning in AD-signature region, but was associated with acceleration of thinning in temporal, frontal and parietal regions, and declines in the volumes of the hippocampus and corpus callosum; 2) these changes in brain structure were more pronounced in patients who developed delirium during hospitalization, and; 3) ICU admission was not associated with increased cortical amyloid burden. The absence of brain amyloid deposition, together with finding that the change in slope of cortical thinning in the AD-signature region was not statistically significant, suggest that older adults following discharge from ICU may demonstrate accelerated neurodegeneration not related to the AD-pathway.

3.2. Relationship to previous studies

Our prior analysis examined cognitive function in MCSA patients aged 70-89 years (not all of these patients had imaging data available for inclusion in the current analysis) [4]. ICU admission was associated with modest but significantly greater declines in global cognitive scores, including subdomains of memory, attention/executive function, and visuospatial function. These domains are also associated in the MCSA population with exposure to anesthesia and surgery [6] and pathology associated with progression of Alzheimer’s disease [33]. The current results provide the neuroanatomical correlates accompanying these cognitive declines. Compared to participants with no ICU admission, those with an ICU admission had greater cortical thinning in temporal, parietal and frontal cortex, but not in occipital cortex, a brain region known to exhibit a high resistance to atrophy with normative aging and Alzheimer’s disease [34, 35]. Acceleration in the rate of hippocampal and corpus callosum atrophy was also observed. The hippocampus is the critical brain region for learning and memory, and hippocampal atrophy is seen both with aging as well as a hallmark of early Alzheimer’s dementia [36, 37]. Atrophy of corpus callosum leads to functional disability because of reduced interhemispheric integration, a pathology characteristic for both normative aging, but also characterizes early stages of Alzheimer’s disease [38, 39]. However, we did not find that ICU admission was associated with increased brain amyloid deposition, which is characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease. Taken together, our study suggests that ICU admission was associated with a detrimental impact on brain health and subsequently cognitive health that is independent of Alzheimer’s disease pathology and lowers the threshold for cognitive impairment [40].

A limited number of reports describe the use of neuroimaging to characterize structural brain changes after ICU hospitalization. Hopkins [12, 41] reviewed literature reports of structural brain imaging in ICU patients, and reported structural brain damage in up to 75% of patients following critical illness. Specifically, ICU admissions were associated with greater atrophy and new white matter lesions in both cortical and subcortical brain structures [9-11]. Finally, a small study of adult respiratory distress syndrome survivors demonstrated new areas of brain atrophy on computed tomography [12]. These studies did not employ a control group of hospitalized patients who did not require ICU admission, nor longitudinal assessments.

Delirium in hospitalized patients is associated with impaired long-term cognitive performance [4, 42-44]. The pathophysiology of delirium is complex [45], but neuroimaging can be a useful investigative tool. After delirium, older adults may have more progressive atrophy in cortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia, as well as increased white matter lesions [10, 46, 47]. In our present study, delirium was associated with greater cortical thinning and reductions of hippocampal volume. We also found that those with pre-existing changes in these regions were at greater risk for developing delirium during ICU admission, consistent with animal and human studies suggesting that the risk of delirium increases with greater severity of preexisting neuropathology [42, 48]. It is possible that the pre-existing changes reflect a pre-existing advanced rate of neurodegeneration in patients at greater delirium risk, which continues after hospital discharge. It is also possible that delirium itself contributes to processes that accelerate neurodegeneration after hospital discharge.

3.3. Limitations

This study has several limitations related to potential for unmeasured confounding. First, the role of preexisting neurodegeneration, comorbidities, disease acuity and/or the ICU environment as causative factors for the observed findings cannot be distinguished. Although we adjusted for available baseline covariates, the patients admitted to the ICU were older and had more comorbidities at enrollment. Furthermore, adjusting for comorbidities does not take into account the potential confounding due to the variable acuity of the given condition. Previous reports demonstrated that MCSA participants with preexisting cognitive impairment are more likely to require hospitalization for critical illness compared to those who are cognitive unimpaired [49, 50]. Thus, given the limited number of MRI assessments before and after ICU admission, we cannot rule out the possibility that patients who required admission were already experiencing accelerated neurodegeneration prior to admission. Finally, given the number of secondary outcomes measured there is a possibility that at least some of the significant findings for these outcomes were due to random variation and represent type I error.

4. Conclusions

We describe the neuroanatomical correlates of accelerated declines in cognitive function observed after ICU admission. Thinning of some cortical regions and declines in the volume of hippocampus and corpus callosum were more pronounced in those patients who developed delirium and were not associated with increased amyloid burden, suggesting that structural changes observed in our main analysis were not specific to Alzheimer’s disease pathology. These changes could be caused by events surrounding ICU admission, or ICU admission could serve as a marker for other causative factors. Regardless, these finding suggest the need for further studies to examine mechanisms, and the need for potential interventions to improve cognitive function in older survivors of ICU admission.

Highlights

Alzheimer disease (AD) produces characteristic changes in brain structure

Cortical thinning is accelerated after critical illness in older adults

This thinning occurs in regions other than those affected by AD

Increased deposition of brain amyloid is not present in these patients.

Delirium during hospitalization further accelerates cortical thinning

Neurodegeneration after critical illness is distinct from AD pathology
